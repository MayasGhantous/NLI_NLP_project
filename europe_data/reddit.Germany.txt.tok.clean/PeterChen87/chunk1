omg , shut up and aceppt that you know nothing about this situation . 
  all you have is a shitty video ( that does n't really show anything besides a small scuffle ) and a vague back story that ( for all i know ) could be completely made up . 
  * nobody * here knows * anything * about the actual situation . 
  can we all just stfu about this ( until we have some hard facts , at least ) ? 
   these are n't ` immigrants ' . 
  theyt are most likely 2nd/3rd generation turks , by the looks and sounds of them . 
  how do you even come up with stuff like this ?? 
  what do turks look like ? 
  do you even know a single word of turkish ? 
  as someone who interacts with `` turks '' ( in '' '' because they 're actually german citizens ) regularly : lol !, 
  no way the guys in the video are turkish . 
   i ca n't understand why police ca n't do anything about this situation . 
  do * what * about * what situation * ? 
  all i see in the video is some young guys in a scuffle with two elderly men . 
  no idea what happened before the video started . 
  nodody got hurt . 
  how the fuck would anyone think that this `` evidence '' was of any use to a police investigation ? 
  all there is is a shitty video that does n't really show anthing , plus some hearsay from the guy hwo made the video . 
  accept it : you know nothing about the actual situation . 
  nobody here knows * anything * abut the actual situation . 
  video evidence * of what * ? 
  all i see in the video is some young guys in a scuffle with two elderly men . 
  no idea what happened before the video started . 
  nodody got hurt . 
  how the fuck would anyone think that this `` evidence '' was of any use to a police investigation ? 
  and how the fuck is this a top post in r/europe ? 
  i 'll tell you how : because some random guy uploaded the video and claimed that it was the `` migrants '' who started shit by molesting a woman . 
  and r/europe is too busy riding the `` all migrants are rapists '' - bandwaggon ; upvoting any rumour and any shitty , unverified story as long as it fits their preconceived notions . 
  but it must be true , because some internet stranger said so !, 
  good job , r/europe !, 
   that is a very very good question ... no . 
  it 's a stupid question ; and it 's a loaded question . 
  these sort of stories are all over german newspapers and tabloids . 
  almost any rumour involving `` immigrants '' is considered newsworthy these days . 
  it 's crazy . 
  but for some people , german public discourse on immigration just is n't racist enough yet . 
  so they 'll keep on whining and complaining about `` liberal media '' , `` political correctness '' , and `` censorship '' . 
  they ca n't be helped . 
  as a german living in germany : it 's probably because you did n't even bother reading any german newspapers in the first place . 
  i read newspapers and online news occasonally , and i see these kind of stories all day every day . 
  any unverified stories and rumours involving `` immigrants '' that can be used to slander immigrants or german immigration policy is considered `` news '' these days . 
  if you wan na be part of this shit show , all you got ta do is to actually watch / read the news . 
  ( z.b. 
  the scenario you 're describing ( a group of men working together to surround and thus physically restrict their victim ) would most likely qualify as `` n\u00f6tigung '' , yes . 
  however , i do n't know if that 's what actually happened in every single instance that night . 
  i 've read recent articles from german womens ' rights groups , who have kind a little bit of an upwind now for their campaigns to close certain `` loopholes '' in the law , that have been allowing abusers and harassers to go scot-free in the past . 
  you 're right in that it 's unclear whether and to what extent these precedents are relevant to what happened at the k\u00f6ln station . 
  i 'm fully aware that u/irerereddit was not asking me a genuine question , if that 's what you 're getting at . 
  i 've said it before : my statements was a purely factual one , about the exent to which the reported acts of abuse / harassment are considered crimes under german law . 
  factual or juridical statements should not be mistaken for a personal emotional or ethical statement on the matter . 
  saying that sth was ` not a crime ' is different from saying that thing ` was n't a big deal ' . 
  i was n't there , idk what exactly happened in detail . 
  but what i heard i found horrifying and disgusting . 
  right now , various womens rights groups in germany are campaigning for law reforms , so that acts of sexual harassment and abuse are better covered and can be prosecuted in the future . 
   the examples you mentioned of the criteria for illicit action was present if im to believe everything being said though , physical trapping/restricting movement = being surrounded by guys and making it hard for them to get away . 
  i get your point . 
  but afaik , the attacker ( s ) has/have to make an active effort to trap / restrict the victim , and simply taking advantage of confined spaces ( like a crowd ) does n't seem to qualify for that ( in terms of the law ) . 
  i do n't know what the excat situation was in any specific case of sexual assault or harassment that happened that night . 
  and , as you mentioned , it 'd be hard to prove anything at this point anyways ... what a mess . 
  it 's only illegal if combined with certain forms of coercion , e.g. 
  grave verbal threats to the victims life or health , or physically trapping or restricting the victim . 
  `` only '' groping or lewd remarks are not illegal . 
  many women 's rights groups in germany have been campaigning for reforms of the law to fix these `` loopholes '' since ... idk , decades probably . 
  here 's a [ recent article ] ( https://www.frauen-gegen-gewalt.de/nachricht/stellungnahme-zu-den-uebergriffen-in-der-silvesternacht-309.html ) on the k\u00f6ln-incident from one group called bff ( `` bundesverband der frauenberatungstellen und frauennotrufe in deutschland '' / `` federal association of womens ' counseling centres and womens ' emergency hotlines in germany '' ) . 
  it 's in german , so idk if this is of any use to you . 
  if you do n't mind me asking : what is `` wacl '' ? 
  is it a acronym ? 
  edit : fixed link, 
  fucking backwards 3rd world country , eh ?!, 
  ( obv this has nothing to do with the `` 3rd world '' ... ) just for the record : i 'm not a law professional or otherwise formally qualified in this field . 
  but i 've spent a lot of time researching this kind of stuff , and there 's plenty of info on the internet ( wikipedia , law blogs , case studies , public documents from legal courts , etc ) . 
  anyone can look it up themselves . 
   i can walk up to a woman , grab her tits and its , legally , perfectly fine ? 
  there 's certain cases where such a situation could escalate into something that 'd be a crime ( e.g. 
  if the victim tries to get away , but the harasser continues his actions while holding her or following her -  now it 's `` n\u00f6tigung '' ( roughly translates to `` coercion '' ) ) . 
  but if it 's `` just '' a few lewd remarks and a grab on the breasts , our lawmakers and judges consider it perfectly fine , yes . 
  about the `` i kill you '' - thing . 
  that could be seen as a threat and maybe turn the thing into a criminal offence . 
  but then again : these guys could always claim that they thought it meant sth else , or that they had simply found it on the ground and they did n't know what it was , or sth like that . 
  no german would 've been jailed over this , so why would a refugee be jailed ? 
  sexual harrassment is not a crimal offence in germany ( except in very very few cases where special laws apply , e.g. 
  work laws , or teacher-student relationships ) . 
  but generally : catcalling or even groping random women in the streets is not a crime . 
  that being said : they 're ofc still fucking assholes . 
  make of that what you will . 
  evidence for what ? 
  that they 're assholes ? 
  - well , i 'd say it 's at least a strong hint . 
  however - and i want to make clear that this is a solely factual statement , and does not represent my personal opinion on the matter - verbally harassing , even groping women is not a crime in germany . 
  so even if this is evidence that they 'd been sexually harassing women that night : as long as they did n't commit an actual crime the police ca n't really do anything about it . 
  that 's the sad state of affairs . 
  edit : lol . 
  stop downvoting me for stating facts , you idiots . 
  well , the spiegel-article is talking about stolen phones . 
  those two suspects were stopped by police somewhere else . 
  it was not them or their phones that had been tracked down to refugee camps . 
  that 'd be `` gutmensch '' ( literally `` good-human '' ) . 
  i like to use that term myself . 
  unfrtunately it 's strongly associated with the right-wing political spectrum , so you should be careful who you use it around if you do n't want to be mistaken for a neonazi-sympathizer . 
  what ?
