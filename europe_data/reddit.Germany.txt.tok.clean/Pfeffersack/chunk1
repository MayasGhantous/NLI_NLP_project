the state has no business with morality . 
  au contraire !, 
  german criminal law is based on morality , too . 
  and even though the judiciary is independent criminal law is still decided on by the parliamentary . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  be as much against it as you want . 
  however , please read into it !, 
  our constitution is heavily influenced by christian ethics . 
  same-sex marriage goes beyond tolerance . 
  that 's respect for the wishes and demands of same-sex couples . 
  embrace indifference * is * better . 
  they flooded the ijsselmeer and made scotland an independent country !, 
  acceptance or respect . 
  tolerance is a different noun . 
  kaliningrad is just not relevant anymore , sigh . 
  he managed to sneak in the eu flag , too . 
  yup . 
  if we would rely on agricultural methods of the beginning of the last century we would have a big problem on our hands . 
  however , we do n't and as such * any kind of * ` we need more space ' rhetoric is inappropriate with current population numbers . 
  ( well , let 's exclude smaller countries * but for countries with land masses such as sweden , france , or great britain this is a non-issue . ), 
  \\* because i do n't know enough about them to make this statement, 
  without wanting to whitewash germany 's history back then everyone was n't unhappy about the start of the first world war . 
   while the area was blocked , an elected right-wing representative of the police union was seen running around with a gun and an iron-cross earring . 
  http://www.heimatohnehass.at/2014/07/der-polizist-mit-dem-eisernen-kreuz.html it 's a source with a lot of background knowledge ( this symbol is n't used just by right-wing folks ) . 
  that 's respectable . 
  dude 's not , though . 
   was the decision of starting uprising good or not ? 
  wtf ? 
  have n't heard that discussion in germany , i admit that 's because of ignorance . 
  apart from nazis , we do n't talk like it 's been a bad one . 
  there must n't be persecution for political views , religious views , gender , skin color , or birth place . 
  at least they should feel safe within europe . 
  unfortunately , that 's not the case , yet . 
  where * are * they ? 
  this is becoming a serious case of [ bielefeld ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld#bielefeldverschw.c3.b6rung ) . 
  they filled up the ijsselmeer !, 
  color me surprised , that 's the first time i 've seen those rides . 
  i guess , they 're more of a southern thing . 
  yeah , fine with me . 
  some other people take this too ` seriously ' . 
   because poland `` was into space '' in 1978 . 
  the nationality of [ hermaszewski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ) is repeatedly scrutinized . 
  circle tool heretic !, 
  checks out . 
  you 're right . 
  however , euromaidan was also in cahoots with svoboda , too . 
  and i do n't mean to defend neither putin nor euromaidan . 
   grovelines gr ** a ** velines is a very beautiful commune . 
  i visited it in 2006 and did n't regret it once . 
   making them the only elected monarchs in the modern world one of these is [ not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/co-princes_of_andorra ) like the other . 
  speaking of bishops , the pope is voted into office as well . 
  additional monarchs : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elected_monarch#current_uses, 
  the german media reported a real low italian turnout ... so this really surprises me . 
  fortunately . 
  thank you for striking out that part . 
  sure , that information is pretty important but even without it the title is correct . 
  true . 
  source : http://www.fahrtipps.de/verkehrsregeln/seitenstreifen-benutzen.php ( first sign ) what 's troublesome is that even a lot of germans do n't know the meaning of this sign or choose to ignore it . 
  as far as i know both the netherlands and belgium want to abolish lighted highways . 
  even during my most drunken stupor i never managed to spill some on my keyboard . 
  and there 's a ton of traffic going through germany . 
  which does bring cash but also creates noise . 
   id/bank account in the country hopefully the banks are swift ( pun intended ) with the establishing of the [ new regulation ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_statement-14-123_en.htm ) . 
  privacy is no issue of sensitivity . 
  cancer - now in all sorts of languages , too . 
  ( maybe \u00e4tt ? ), 
  yeah , although you speak german you 're in a different part of the german speaking region . 
  never heard * affenschwanz * in northern germany . 
  as some of them already do that , this is probably not even a bump in the road : /, 
  thank you for putting things into perspective . 
  the article has the fine at 75 $ rather than 300 $ . 
  as it is customary for reddiquette i offer my personal explanation for the down vote : people are tired of the lame / r/pyongyang joke . 
  move on . 
  as [ germany halts ] ( http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/03/20/355404/germany-suspends-russia-arms-deal/ ) her arms deals with russia maybe you want to buy our goods ? 
  merkelschanze . 
  we removed him first . 
  the * bundeswehr * did for eight years . 
  in africa , there are red crosses in a combat zone : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/06/central-african-republic-timeline of course , you * are * correct that there are groups which specifically target them . 
   know more about the job than a fucking medic . 
  [ some of us do . 
   this is not political censorship for this particular video , but the result of a conflict between gema and youtube there 's no political censorship intended because gema is protecting solely music . 
  however , one effect of this ` protection ' * is * political censorship and it 's becoming more and more regular . 
  loaded question much . 
  terminally ill children did n't have to suffer before this bill .

  sorry for rt : [ police officer killed , two others captured as violence resumes in kiev -- rt news ] ( http://rt.com/news/kiev-rioters-chaos-police-167/ ) [ kiev truce falls apart , and unrest resurges - nytimes.com ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/world/europe/ukraine-protests.html?_r=0 ) ( cf. 
  ` interior ministry said ' ), 
  nope , it 's up . 
  well ... 
  i would rather not talk about that as that would make me agitated . 
  thanks for your concern , though . 
  for all the flak russia is getting i like how russia is actually after political stability and diplomacy -- conflicts within russia or very close to russia 's border get disregarded for a moment . 
  the reverse is more important for both immigrants and society , children of immigrants * tend to * integrate with the host society . 
  yes , all immigrants and their descendants are separating themselves from society . 
  which is an important piece of info since no one would actually side with the cop ... unless you know that she ` licked his visor , i wet my fingers and touched his mouth ' . 
  i immediately needed to listen to the original to get that horrid remix out of my head . 
  ughh .
