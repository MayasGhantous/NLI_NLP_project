  however , those lawmakers are in the opposition ( german for ` parties not being part of the government ' ) and do n't have much influence . 
  you 're right there are no electronic comunication devices allowed in the conclave . 
  i can only speculate but maybe the vatican counterintelligence messed up and the nsa successfully placed an old-school bug on archbishop bergoglio . 
  when chrome became a thing i was browing reddit with it and had a dual browser setup . 
  i 'm now back to firefox only and i 've got to admit i like it and do n't want back . 
  now , i know you 're not totally serious but germany gave a fuck . 
  actually the workers in precarious work did . 
  they would tell you a story lots of europeans would regret to hear , i.e. 
  working conditions which are just dishonorable . 
   given that anyone could buy some smokes in vending machines at the corners of streets . 
  you have to provide an id-card or your driver 's license to prove that you 're over 18 . 
  the bgb is an interesting if not frightening view into the * kaiserreich * . 
  somehow even the [ japanese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_code_of_japan#civil_law ) got it in 1896 . 
  ^ ^ frightening ^ ^ because ^ ^ of ^ ^ the ^ ^ stringency . . 
  true in germany ( relevant to this submission ) , too . 
  nice hyperbole . 
  the * zentralrat * is off a good times but you brought the word anti-semitic in here . 
   a law was passed a few months later in order to `` protect the religious freedom of jews and muslims '' that just happened to invalidate the ruling . 
  citation needed . 
  no law can be passed to surpass a ruling . 
   german circumcisions came from muslim ( turkish ) tradition no . 
  there have been medical indications for circumcisions way before muslims migrated . 
  a region with lots of jews and few muslims would still carry out circumcisions way before the age of four . 
  some or many redditors are the / r/atheism type atheists . 
  i pity them . 
  you can ban a group of criminals and their successive groups . 
  it 's costly and a big effort . 
  and the tricks of the criminals to surpass the ban are not as cheesy as the one you mentioned ( they splinter and mask themselves , change tactics , etc. ), 
  our government is a joke . 
   always keep talking to yourself . 
  so you gon na explain me what a difference of a hdi of 0.007 is or who ? 
  that sounds like the [ sbz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_occupation_zone ) or trizonesien . 
  now about that turnout ... 
  at least those wo n't be ours , 
  then he shall bring it down . 
  out of the ruins will rise a new , free , and healthy italy . 
  all of that 's been done prior to ww2 and probably even way before then . 
  the point is you would try harder and/or by a different approach . 
  and that 's exactly what is needed . 
  we ca n't continue to blindly pedaling into an unsure future . 
  one of the many reasons why the germans accepted the treaty of versailles was because of the hunger . 
  ( [ home front ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_germany_during_world_war_i#home_front ) , look for ` food ' ) one of the reasons why ww2 kept going was because the nazi government was willing and * relatively * able to keep germans fed . 
  edited : added citation and * clarification *, 
   reverse vending machines are similar in kind so i did n't care to upload specific ones . 
  but it 's good that you mentioned it !,

   and possibly no other nation than russia . 
  there are other nations but they are few : [ states formally recognising abkhazia or south ossetia as independent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_abkhazia_and_south_ossetia#states_formally_recognising_abkhazia_or_south_ossetia_as_independent ) 1 . 
  venezuela 4 . 
  agreed . 
  russia sent [ 150 tanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93georgia_war#military_equipment ) into georgia and bombarded georgia . 
  georgia never sent a single soldier into russia . 
  hmm ? 
  and i wo n't say adieu , well , unless for specified use , 
  different country , different meaning . 
  if that 's not legitimate you 'd have to cease to use the word vasistas immediately . 
  * adieu * is understood by most if not all germans . 
  now , who gets to decide that ? 
  do n't worry , we 've got your back . 
  they started carrying mp5s and stopped carrying them , at least at the german central stations i visit . 
  remember the 1840s-1880s in the us ? 
  germans were immigrating * en masse * to the us for different reasons but including the search for work . 
  i just hope germany will accommodate these people and every immigrant with right amount of decency so that they we live together in peace and prosperity . 
  it 's a one-way road , yes . 
  no , there wo n't be tragedies because some immigrants live their own culture and have seldom contact with the host culture . 
  friesland can into big !, 
  you 're not wrong , though , it would be advisable to state your * bundesland * . 
  well , at least the ministry saw it fit admitting their helplessness [ to get there in time to provide help ] . 
  the first generation of turkish immigrants found jobs , payed taxes , and payed health insurance . 
  tax pays for schools while paying health insurance keeps the health system intact . 
  so guest workers ( who do have work ) contributed to germany 's success . 
  \\* the problem of turkish immigrants being unable to find jobs arose during later generations, 
  do you know a classification of sexualities by skin color ? 
  similar to bisexual , homosexual , or heterosexual ? 
  did i say anything different ? 
   why would you say it 's okay to put men and women in different areas at a debate ? 
  because they freely choose to do so . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/10/segregated-seating-row-at-ucl-debate_n_2848326.html?utm_hp_ref=uk there 's mixed reports coming in whereas the third section is just for couples , married couples , or just you and me . 
  i would n't want to trust huffingtonpost.co.uk nor richarddawkins.net but to me it seems there 's more to it and richard dawkins makes a big fuss about it like he always does . 
  the fella works with sensationalism , does n't he ? 
  exactly . 
  before this article i did n't know of this party and i 'm not ignorant to german politics . 
  i 'd be surprised if it would even get 1 % ( yeah , just one percent ) in the next election . 
  richard dawkins in this article equates gender with skin color . 
  there 's a difference between skin color and gender because for example you do n't choose your sex partner by skin color but more so by gender . 
  so that 's just one example why gender and skin color can not be equated at * all * times like dawkins suggests . 
  basically , he 's just a whiny one unable to cope with the rules he does n't set up personally . 
  suck it up . 
  you could n't get rid of ie without seriously destabilizing your operating system . 
  what more imposing of software do you need ? 
   in versions of windows before vista , it is also not possible to run microsoft 's windows update or microsoft update with any other browser due to the service 's implementation of an activex control http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_explorer#removal with all the millions of windows xp in the wild those users are forced to stay with the ie . 
  advertising is okay but do n't force your users to stay with your own products by shipping it with your product and integrating it deeply within your product which has been the case in older days/previous versions of windows . 
  we 're in the same boat ... 
  no glass of beer for germany but a glass of whine in portugal ? 
  you mean , like , gold as a metal ? 
  or as color ? 
  your image is good for what it is . 
  but it 's missing some details which are lost because of the silly shadow present on the flags : for instance , germany 's flag is black , red , and ** gold ** and belgium 's flag is black , ** yellow ** , and red . 
  however , you ca n't see the difference in the image . 
  either the belgian flag is too dark or germany 's flag is too bright .
