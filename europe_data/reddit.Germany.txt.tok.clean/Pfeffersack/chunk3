  wikipedia gets it right : [ flag of belgium ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_belgium `` belgian flag '' ) and [ flag of germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_germany `` german flag '' ) . 
  another example is germany and andorra : andorra 's ** yellow ** is too dark compared to the german ** gold ** . 
  again , how does capitalistic proficiency translate into knowledge ? 
  does it turn you into a philosopher ? 
  does it make you a scientific genius ? 
  how 's being a billionaire proof of not being stupid or incompetent ? 
  there are bad/stupid/incompetent people and then there is berlusconi , 
  getting some votes is different to winning the election , most of the times . 
  who is prepared for warfare ? 
  the only thing stopping mass migration to western europe are programs aimed at stabilizing and economically fixing the regions where migrants come from . 
  as many , not all but many problems stem from colonization we owe these countries . 
  i watched * presseclub * yesterday and one of them claimed it 's printed in the * s\u00fcddeutsche * . 
  it 's probably ( hehe who knows ) unrelated but the ex mayor of munich bought a house in greece and needed to sue authorities in order to be able to pay taxes . 
  the german democratic republic shot , too . 
  it helped nobody . 
  sorry , i 've got to disagree . 
  in a way it is an appointment-confirmation process : after every general election the chancellor establishes his or her cabinet . 
  that way , the parties have a say in who becomes new boss of the kfw . 
  well , for starters the current cabinet has ministers which are n't from the same party . 
  it 's good that for this very important post nobody has a seat for a very long time and the director ( loosely translated ) changes . 
  since a [ few years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_germany#2011_census ) ( [ # 2 ger ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/religionen_in_deutschland#religionen_in_deutschland_in_zahlen ) ) , there are a few more catholics in germany than protestants . 
  that 's especially noteworthy since the ` new eastern l\u00e4nder ' are traditionally protestant and early in the reunification germany has been predicted to become dominated by protestantism . 
  which it may have been but the trend is reversing . 
  you can be a theologian and a respectable scientist , i.e. 
  not a believer in ` intelligent ' design . 
  [ # 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_roman_catholic_cleric-scientists ) , [ # 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_catholic_scientists ) ninja edit : yeah , just # 1 . 
  it 's the * vorauseilender gehorsam * . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  i just want to add that both genders are being pushed into traditional roles . 
  it does n't seem to change much but consider being politically active -- even if that 's just not voting for the ones who are so-so with espionage . 
  hans r\u00fchle is complaining - and he 's not part of any official organization anymore . 
  german saying : your last car is always a [ station wagon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/station_wagon ) . 
  a world in which corporations have even bigger influence and go unchecked because of trade agreements ? 
  no , thank you . 
  yup , every german mayor of a town near a us base can relate . 
  the bottom line is have enough russians in russia say that and act on it putin 's knees would be shaking . 
  mg-42 : 7.92 mm . 
  mg-3 : 7.62 mm . 
  speaking of trams , [ timi\u0219oara ] ( https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/tramvaiul_din_timi%c8%99oara ) operates trams of my home city ( hansa gt4 ) . 
  old but not obsolete and much better than letting them decay or scrapping them . 
  edit : gt4c - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqp4bb7n0pe, 
  let 's pretend you 're right for a moment . 
  i 'm sure b\u00f6hmermann is making fun of it and quite aware of the meta level . 
  no , does n't make being proud any better but some of us germans understand what you 're trying to get across . 
  can we please use rod of aesculapius instead of the erroneous caduceus ? 
  depends were they live , what company it is , etc. 
  i 'm not saying it 's a loophole * every single time * . 
  yeah , that bavarian bit was confusing . 
  ~ ~ it 's a german company with an american subsidiary which employs you in germany . ~ ~ :d thanks for clearing that up . 
  initially , i was thinking you worked for a px in an american garrison ( e.g. 
  [ grafenw\u00f6hr ] ( http://militarybases.com/germany/ ) ) . 
  that 's not how  german companies work . 
  that seems fishy .

  there 's probably more to it and/or your company is exploiting a tax loophool . 
  ~ ~ bavaria receives your * lohnsteuer * , though . 
  ( wage tax ) ~ ~ edit : there are exceptions to this rule . 
  it 's not about not being able to say that soldiers would n't get into that situation . 
  1 ) h&k never made a claim the rifle could achieve to take that abuse 2 ) all the other combat rifles in the world behave similar under an equal amount of stress - german engineering as good as it is does n't rely on magic and even with a german made rifle you ca n't shoot physics . 
  depends on whether you think the end of the middle ages where recent . 
  the first photo is the * plenarsaal * which is located in the * b\u00fcrgerschaft * ( * haus der b\u00fcrgerschaft * ) . 
  it 's not inside the city hall . 
  it 's dangerous but not because of the call . 
  the criminals themselves present the danger and the sooner you know they are criminals the better . 
  call the emergency service number ( 911 in the us or 112 for europe etc ) and after dispatch made a call to the police station they know if the police is actually police . 
  if you know the telephone number of your police station or the number of police , e.g. 
  110 in germany , that will speed up the process . 
  call the cops on the cops . 
  it 's relatively easy to fake a badge but it 's a lot of work to interrupt your call . 
  so when the cops are legitimate dispatch knows about them . 
  thanks . 
  ( though , i really like redditisfun . 
  and i do n't say this to stir shit -- your experience is just different to mine . ), 
  you 'd be awesome if you edit your comment to reflect further information . 
   but often literally 8 yeah , i mean , look at this little heap : [ pegiga k\u00f6ln , k\u00d6gida ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/k%c3%b6gida-demo_am_21.01.2015_in_k%c3%b6ln-13.jpg/1280px-k%c3%b6gida-demo_am_21.01.2015_in_k%c3%b6ln-13.jpg ), 
   but i 've had expected that germany as a whole would swing back toward more conservatism . 
  it 's already happened in the last vote ( wtf , 41,5 % cdu ) , just the politics are n't up to date . 
  well , everybody wants to have the cake and eat it . 
  if the member countries of the eu move forward and begin federalisation we will have a future which we could be promising . 
  and i do think we will be wise enough . 
  however , it 'll take a long time . 
  ferries are way cheaper . 
  do n't get me wrong , they will transport people on the way back ( those who did n't get asylum ) . 
  that 's shadowbanning . 
  people ca n't see your posts and ca n't vote on them . 
  it is true . 
  though , most of the time when found with cannabis a german cop would diligently write a report . 
  then , if you 're found with a [ geringe menge ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/menge_%28bet%c3%a4ubungsmittelrecht%29#geringe_menge_bei_cannabisprodukten ) chances are the case will be dropped . 
  there is no guarantee it 'll be dropped but common knowledge has it bavarian prosecutors enforce it more often . 
  yes , most cops would write a report . 
  however , if the case is dropped there will be no criminal record !, 
  i can agree with that . 
   some idiots gon na ruin the fun . 
  that 's why there need to be tighter controls . 
  as sad and frustrating that is . 
  the way this is running is exactly that : less personal responsibility because the airport and spanish authorities have to deal with it . 
  the airline has to make sure its ticket system is n't abused . 
  if all prayer is treated like not existing * every * religion is discriminated against . 
  they all get treated equally bad . 
  what 's next ?
