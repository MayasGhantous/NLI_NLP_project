  silencing political freedom of thought ? 
  no , the rational way to do this is letting everyone have their little corner of freedom . 
  * [ another picture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/milano_italy_torre-velasca-from-duomo-01.jpg/1280px-milano_italy_torre-velasca-from-duomo-01.jpg ) * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torre_velasca, 
   governments still have to take public opinion into account before they act . 
  yes and no . 
  they were elected by the people and should n't sway their opinion to the opposite because they were n't elected to be opportunists . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  though , when there 's that many people on the streets , maybe there should be * reelections * instead ? 
  that way maybe ( ! ), 
  public opinion is represented better in office . 
  exactly because there 's no excuse they should be imprisoned here . 
  where they come from there 's probably not even a prison let alone a justice system . 
  triple . 
  seems like he lost his arm digging . 
  may i ask why they do n't sound like a happy couple to you ? 
  heer is the * teilstreitkraft * ( loosely defined as land based part ) of the bundeswehr . 
  as far as i know , army can * be used for both , so the confusion can originate there . 
  * can be but should n't , as it leads to confusion . 
  * herr * is the word you 're looking for . 
  * heer * = army, 
  some of the causes include low unemployment rates and higher rents . 
  cities which are red may have a higher percentage of unemployment rates and lower rents whereas cities which are green may have a lower percentage of jobless people and higher rent . 
  breivik was ( is ) linking multiculturalism to communism and an active will to destroy the national identity . 
  that 's not true for any of the politicians you listed . 
  they are n't icons for promoting nationalism . 
  however , they 're not overly liberal , are they ? 
  they are all driving their agenda to herd ( except sarkozy , of course ) every vote the can get . 
  you 're welcome to couchsurf in bremen , if i may say so . 
  city tour included . 
  it already takes an astonishing amount of work and money to get to parent 1 and parent 2 . 
  making two form sheets instead of one does n't sound that ambitious compared to that . 
  technically the inquisition was the first time you had access to a modern day lawyer . 
  the inquisition , while horrid in most ways , * did * advance the legal system in some ways .

  [ excerpt ] ( http://heinonline.org/hol/landingpage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/sjilc20&amp;div=11&amp;id=&amp;page= ) . 
   the study of canon law , the legal system of the catholic church , fused with that of roman law to ** form the basis of the refounding of western legal scholarship ** . 
  source : [ western law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/western_law ) some members of the catholic church did horrifying things but on the other hand laid the groundwork for modern day justice . 
  that is a fact often forgotten . 
  i can verify this . 
  you also get free drugs for raising your blood iron level . 
  your country does have a viable solution to the nuclear waste problem whereas my country will argue about that for decades to come . 
  that means i ( as well as any other german ) was very lucky to experience lighted superhighways when i was there . 
  bild sucks . 
  you get a chance to understand it , though : 6 [ 0 000 euro strafe f\u00dcr ex-vermieter vom grindel hamburgs teuerstes \u201e a. . . loch `` ] ( http://www.bild.de/regional/hamburg/beleidigung/hohes-bussgeld-fuer-ausraster-25837808.bild.html ) the victim is said to be 36-year-old . 
  there 's a lot of common sense in your response . 
  and i 'm personally not against it , common sense is great . 
  however , under german law this is a crime which is * only punishable when you report it * to the police -- so you are having a good chance to settle this on your own when you 're the one who has been insulted . 
  now vice versa , say you 're the one who insults various people on a regular basis -- this is just a random example , i do n't think you insult people on a regular basis . 
  should n't they have a right to report you ? 
  and most important of all : the * learning effect which follows by the monetary fine * . 
  with great money comes great responsibility . 
  and protected the other man 's dignity . 
  now i ask you : which right is more valuable ? 
  the right to insult or the right to be safe from insults ? 
  no , you 're not . 
   this is why i propose we allow french and german next to english as languages officially allowed for articles . 
  ( i did n't notice it until i read comelli 's comment ), 
   communists are fucking subhuman scum and every bit as bad as nazis . 
  while the latter part of this quote may posses much truth the former part is just atrocious on its own . 
  no one is subhuman through possession of an ideology , no matter what . 
  that 's every bit of judgmental thinking both communism and nazism shared . 
  what is going on there ? 
  [ recent earthquakes near onesti , vaslui , romania ] ( http://earthquaketrack.com/ro-38-onesti/recent ), 
  it 's a weird selection , alright . 
  ( probably that 's connected to the positioning of monitoring stations . ), 
  in that case , yes . 
  is it ? 
  most of that is the `` god of the gaps '' fallacy . 
  that may very well be the case . 
  it 's just that reason does n't get thrown out just because you 're religious . 
  being religious does n't exclude employing reason . 
  and just because we 've got no scientific proof of our faith does n't logically make reason absent . 
  you 're comparing apples with oranges trying to get scientific proof in faith for allowing reason into it . 
   religion and in fact any form of faith , because it is a surrender of reason hitchens reiterates what he detests , when , in fact , religion does not stand in the way of reason per se . 
  how else could [ georges lema\u00eetre ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georges_lema%c3%aetre ) , a belgian priest , come up with the big bang theory ? 
  how else could islamic science flourish during the [ islamic golden age ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_golden_age ) ? 
  reason is n't something a religious person randomly chooses to have . 
  this has not been made a law . 
   about half of germany 's autobahns have a defined speed limit of 81 . 
   beer gets warm near the end how long does it take for one ? 
  i 'm a slow drinker and by the time of * one hour * it 's still reasonably cold . 
  but by all means , drink out of any kind of glass you want . 
  the content is far more important . 
  shall we bring up the topic of hats ? 
  the point is the category of 0-4 % is applicable because of the possibility of independents . 
  the threshold to enter the * riksdagen * is n't universal . 
  in fact , there currently is an independent member in it . 
  de1 de2 hahaha . 
  mixed rural and urban areas . 
  high fluctuation are the direct result of a heterogeneous society . 
  the embracing of `` old virtues '' of the fdp was definitely surprising . 
  the liberals needed a new course and if the federal fdp adopts it they 're way better of for next federal election ( as projected by this election ) . 
  they have distanced themselves from the program of westerwelle but so far did n't come with anything else of substance . 
  more like weimar republic , 1923 . 
  the nsdap of 1933 were much more intelligent and although still relying on physical intimidation and battery , they concentrated their efforts on single occasions . 
  the sa was * severely limited * in their actions after 1925 . 
  the nazis of around 1923 emphasized on brute methods , aggressiveness , and were ultimately putschists . 
  the nazis of 1933 relied on extensive * propaganda * , ( limited but more sophisticated ) * reason * , and political * cleverness * . 
  bavaria is not a part of germany . 
  physical force on part of them would show their true face .
