  what do you mean ? 
  withdrawing visa free travel is wrong , is n't it ? 
  because that 's fortunately not how the eu chooses to do business - fighting fire with fire . 
   it 's only marginally so . 
  say that in the face of the victims . 
  and the ones who lost their property in an arson . 
  and to the poor immigrants . 
  and to ... 
  no , with his logic we can only operate as a society if native europeans play along , too . 
  there 's nothing wrong , i.e. 
  xenophobic , with his first reply . 
  in fact , i think you just like accusing him of being xenophobic by concluding people who down voted you were xenophobes . 
   judges are ** just ** people badum tish . 
  gathering of those who call for destruction of legal order will not be allowed , '' milanovi\u0107 pointed out . 
  i take it that croatia 's prime minister is honest about that . 
  however , i highly value your opinion and if you 've got more inside why the banning is inappropriate and uncalled for , i 'd be glad to be enlightened . 
  i disagree . 
  as an impromptu move this quite appropriate . 
  they should n't hesitate to ban the party through legal means ( ban as you proposed ) , right after this . 
  i agree . 
  the low turnout and the sheer ignorance ( some willful , some out of laziness , some out of ... ) would make an elected president one of the most unwanted jobs . 
  if we do this we ca n't afford to do it wrong so i 'm in favor of a slow process of the current approach . 
  you should have made an additional poll , though . 
  nothing wrong with your comment , i just append more precise dates : north rhine-westphalia will have its [ election on the 13 may 2012 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_rhine-westphalia_state_election,_2012 ) and the next german federal election ( for which we still need a new law because of the * \u00dcberhangmandate * and the * negative stimmgewicht * ) [ will occur in between the 1 september and 27 october 2013 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_2013 ) . 
  i 'm referring to the name of cologne . 
  colony . 
  does that ring any bells ? 
  it 's not as simple as that . 
  there are many [ exceptions ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/auslieferung_\\ ( recht \\ ) ) : an extradition is generally permissible if 1 . 
  the deed is punishable in both countries and it is established 2 . 
  the target country wo n't torture the accused 3 . 
  the target country wo n't use capital punishment 4 . 
  a fair process needs to be ensured 5 . 
  there is no need for an extradition treaty ( 6 . ), 
  there were many constitutional extraditions from germany in the past . 
  edited . 
  i was speculating you two are not that far off each other . 
  prestian is in favor of ~ ~ national identities ~ ~ a society of individuals whereas you are disapproving of that structure . 
  is n't the society of individuals the same as a group divided into more coherent parts ? 
  as far as his reasoning on why there 's a crisis that 's hardly news and widely accepted within france and germany . 
  we 've compromised the system and other countries followed . 
  on the other hand we did n't force greece to hire that many state employees with inflated salaries . 
  bremen would remain independent . 
  if the tax income of the ports would n't go to lower saxony ( which was introduced in 1970 with the reform of the personal income tax ) we would be economically independent and part of the donor countries . 
   the constitutional court will take up the court and rule quickly ( it 's about a kid , they 've got a turbo for such cases they 've got to go through the instances ( as they 've gone through the kammergericht ( olg ) the bundesgerichtshof must be involved ) first . 
   charite wo n't do any forcing if they are n't planning to serve prison time . 
  you 're right . 
  the charite wo n't do anything against the patient 's will . 
   the article suggests , as does your comment , that parents ' consent is required for the `` youth service '' to remove the child and place her in an institution and eventual foster care . 
  is that true in all cases ? 
  no , that 's incomplete . 
  of course , i 'm * not * a lawyer  however , i am a male boy scout leader and a male teacher in the making . 
  both of which , apparently , are required to know the law to the letter . 
  your corresponding term in the us may be a * shelter care hearing order * . 
  in germany , the term is * inobhutnahme * which is also a * court order * meaning the youth services do the actual work but do n't decide on whether to act or not . 
  that decision is the responsibility of the court . 
  now , what that means is the * jugendamt * can , in cases where the law mandates it , act against parents ' consent . 
  which , sadly , is sometimes needed in cases of abuse or similar tragedies . 
  yes , the rationale is wrong . 
  a profound psychological evaluation should take place in any possible outcome . 
  that 's sad and it 's unreasonable behavior of the parents . 
  but as from now , as it seems , it 's of best interest for the transgender girl to be taken care of by professionals . 
  and that the taz thinks the berlin charite will force a sex reassignment therapy against the transgender girl 's will is laughable . 
  they know that they 've got to get the patient 's consent or otherwise any therapy will ultimately fail . 
   dismantle religion is n't that pretty radical ? 
  i 'm a german citizen , then a european . 
  but those citizenships are n't even on the same level as there is no european country or nation . 
  it 's not only the rich . 
  biofuels are readily available at gas stations . 
  the european union is to blame for actually requiring gas stations to provide biofuels . 
   by denying nazis freedom of speech you 're saving freedom of speech because they want to abolish it . 
  by killing a nazi you save lives because they want to kill . 
  just replace `` nazis '' with `` communist '' and you got dachau all over again . 
  the exact same reasoning the nazis installed the nationwide repression . 
  no , thank you . 
   what you demand is called censorship . 
  where do you find that in fforw 's comment ? 
  i find it precarious to ban certain kind of clothes , too . 
  however , let 's keep it up to the facts . 
  the bottom line is we * do n't need a more federal * ( centralized ) european union * in order to get a centralized ( united ) voice * . 
  if we keep going with creating institutions before we agree on what it does we 'll end up ruining the european idea of free member states . 
  there are more people living in north rhine-westphalia than in the netherlands . 
  now what ? 
   the odds the odds have been proven wrong time and time again . 
  a meltdown should statistically occur every 50 years . 
  but here we are ... 
   it is not a pipe dream . 
  prototype & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  that 's because you only live for say 70 years . 
  you would think differently if you lived for several thousand years close to that waste . 
   there has n't been any real contamination above background levels in japan huh . 
  so this is why [ they decide to wash their houses ] ( http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/aj2011101815066 ) . 
   with the biggest diaspora of kurds and turks in the world germany ca n't say i do n't feel sympathy for them folks . 
  however i feel * we 're being forced to act * in that conflict . 
  for example during my internship in a school one of the pupils ( all of them 11 to 13 year olds ) mentions kurdistan as his native country whereas another pupil reacted and without being asked replied `` kurdistan does n't exist '' . 
  when the hate and aggression is being forced and spoon fed i feel utter disgust , too . 
  however this turns out it 's going to get very ugly at first . 
  maybe that 's reason enough for getting less and less involved . 
  if the nato got involved in the kurdistan conflict every party would cry foul . 
  who is practicing hypocrisy ?
