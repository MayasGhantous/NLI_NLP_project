the answer is yes . 
   coordinating deployment between all eu states takes a long time though , no way could we have secured the crashsite before the rebels started looting . 
  even an individual state could n't have stopped any looting . 
  reportedly all valuables on the crash site were gone within hours , and if the rebels wanted to destroy evidence they already did the damage . 
  realistically you ca n't just send troops in a foreign country overnight like that , eu or not . 
  at the very least you 'd need clearance from kiev , if you want to make sure you do n't get under fire you 'd need to ask the rebels as well , and you probably would n't get a response as quickly as you would like . 
  until we 've decided which country 's troops to send and cleared the necessary diplomatic channels to send troops there , those bodies would have started to rot in the fields . 
  i can understand your and everyone else 's anger and how you feel the need that we must do something right now , but it 's just not a realistic option . 
  the local authorities need to handle the bodies - yes , this likely means the rebels , i 'm afraid . 
  or whomever they are inclined to ask for help . 
  first i thought it was fitting angela would be reading `` stern reviews '' , then i was wondering why they capitalized the adjective , then i felt very dumb . 
  send out the strong-worded letter, 
  that 's just silly , eleven is an uneven number . 
   as harsh as it is , you reap what you sow . 
  let 's kick them while they 're on the ground , shall we . 
  i 'm surprised how unpopular ireland is . 
  i guess no jobs for immigrants who do n't work in it . 
   it 's there : `` gro\u00dfbritannien '' i apologise on behalf of all germans for falsely calling you `` great britain '' , but `` vereinigtes k\u00f6nigreich '' is just too lengthy and unwieldy and we have no common acronym for the country , which is why we use the terms interchangeably even when we know it 's incorrect . 
   if you want advice to go to a good university you need to look at what you do outside of school . 
  internships , sports , foreign languages ( especially unusual ones ) , volunteer work and interesting hobbies will show you are a more rounded person than just an academic and will help to make you stand out more in applications ( for university and for work ) for super-elite unis ( oxbridge ) such things are a requirement , even . 
  science or medical . 
  humanistics likely wo n't score you a job , and afaik the financial stuff you commonly get on a high-school curriculum wo n't give you much of an edge at university even if you end up taking business classes ; going for the science / maths route would likely be more helpful in that case . 
  but this certainly depends on the curriculum in your specific country . 
  whatever you choose , you really need to enjoy it to * some * degree to be a viable option to pursue on an academic level at university - you 're going to spend a lot of time with your uni studies , for many , many years . 
  just keep in mind that your choice now is n't * that * important yet , university will give you plenty chances to prove your worth even if high-school did n't prepare you in the right fields . 
   source ? 
  just something i 've heard so often i assumed it must be correct . 
  thanks for the read . 
   oddly enough , if you look a little further down , one of the top 11 countries of people that want to move to the us is the uk . 
  that seems a little surprising considering job prospects in the uk are pretty good and it is a good market to start a business . 
  maybe it 's the weather ? 
  i 'm not even joking , the prospect of moving somewhere where people speak the same language and have the same quality of live but tons of sunshine and a mild climate can be very tempting . 
  imagine they spoke german on the iberian peninsula , half our population would be gone overnight . 
  well , if they had jobs in spain and portugal . 
   btw , does anyone know , if a jewish family does not want to circumcise their son , would they face discrimination from other jews ? 
  not sure if they really would , but most certainly * fear * they ** could ** face discrimination , which is why even `` secular jews '' ( i.e. 
  non-jews with jewish ancestors ) commonly circumcise their newborn sons . 
   the outrage is about the infant not having a choice in whether part of their penis is cut off . 
  the agency quoted in this article is raging about the now common requirement for medical supervision when circumcising someone in various european countries , and is seeing this as a sign of growing anti-semitic sentiments on the continent . 
   no european country has outright banned the practice , but there is increasing pressure to do so , and some countries have imposed restrictions such as requiring medical supervision . 
   you heard it . 
  if jews are n't allowed to mutilate their dicks , it could lead to the demise of the whole jewish communities !, 
  you ca n't be a jew and have a foreskin . 
  those are the rules . 
  to be fair , in judaism the circumcision practice is * the * sign for their pact with god , so no , you ca n't really be a jew and keep your foreskin . 
  still , circumcising a newborn robs the child off the freedom to make such a decision on their own , so imo waiting until the affected person is old enough to consent ( or not ) would certainly be preferable . 
   i was just surprised how much some women seem to prefer it , especially women who have had sex with more uncircumcised guys than not . 
  circumcised men last longer , so that may be the reason for the preference . 
   so you gave a shit ? 
  check and mate . 
   i fully identify with british culture . 
   bollocks yup , checks out . 
  but then who 's going to buy all our cheap beer ? 
   violent anarchists . 
  with all the street action going on in the other bulletin points i read this as something like `` anarchical violinists '', 
   not so fast ... yurop stronk !, 
  oh lord , that 's a very long line - and a very deep drop . 
  i so want to try that thing . 
   what 's wrong with tagesschau/tagesthemen ? 
  i find the reporting very straightforward and neutral compared to swedish tv news . 
  i could n't tell , i do n't watch tv . 
   as i remember they show some bias towards conservatism simply in what they report about in the first place . 
  although alas , there 's only so much you can fit into 15 minutes of news footage , so i ca n't really blame them for focusing on what the majority is probably interested in . 
  der standard certainly is n't a bad newspaper , arguably the best in austria by quite a margin , but they are n't exactly unbiased either ( progressive leftish with very open support for feminism , as far as i can tell ) . 
  i mostly read the nzz on topics on germany / austria ( or on whatever international affairs these are involved in ) when available , to get an outside view on the issue . 
  i found it 's in general often very enlightening to read up on local issues as reported by an `` outsider '' . 
  it 's true though , i 've run into a couple articles that were evidently biased in some way . 
  but the author would often portray opinions that were n't even open for discussion in the respective country , or a minority opinion at any rate . 
  ah yes , i love the nzz . 
  by central european standards quite unusual , they seem to have their focus on international news . 
  i would often read it when i was living in austria ( as i 'm not aware of a single even remotely neutral austrian newspaper ) . 
  switzerland borders france , austria borders hungary . 
  i believe there 's a number of decent german newspapers . 
  personally i 'm reading the online version of the ** [ frankfurter allgemeine ( faz ) ] ( http://faz.net ) ** . 
  whenever i 'm recommending the faz to friends they accuse the paper of being neoliberal propaganda or something , but i do n't see such tendencies at all ; must be some reflex because they 're based in frankfurt , i guess ? 
  they very clearly separate opinion pieces from reporting and news , which tend to stay clear of sensationalist speculation , and when they do print some authors ' commentaries ( which they do have a lot of , on their website anyway ) they frequently have some opposing views somewhere , too . 
  another biggish newspaper i can think of which people consider very respectable is the ** s\u00fcddeutsche ** . 
  there 's also ** der spiegel ** of course , but their glory days are over i guess . 
  it 's still a decent weekly paper though , but they 're occasionally being accused of having a bias towards being pro-us and pro-isreal . 
  i ca n't recommend any tv news shows here , unfortunately . 
  barbarossa was , in fact , emperor of the hre . 
  still , monarchs who accomplished great deeds are comparatively rare throughout our history , most were too busy with petty infighting, 
  i always imagine he must have had really radical facial hair if everyone just referred to him as `` redbeard '' . 
   law to start with . 
  we 're hiring from australia at the moment . 
  excuse the probably silly question , but i 've always wondered what use lawyers from other countries could possibly have ? 
  would n't someone who studied in australia have to relearn most of everything when working in the uk ? 
  or is australia just similar enough in that respect ? 
   also i imagine that even if a frenchman could speak perfect english he would swear up and down that he could n't . 
  reminds me of a frenchman with a ph.d. in mathematics teaching at my uni . 
  he speaks german nearly flawlessly ( with a slight , charming accent ) , yet about every other sentence you hear from him is along the lines of `` do you understand what i mean ? '', 
  `` sorry , my german is n't so good '' `` did i formulate this correctly ? '' . 
  when asked a question he always finishes his explanation with `` er , did i understand that question correctly ? '', 
   christ this makes me nervous . 
  thinking about doing a year at t\u00dcm and i was hoping i could break out of german at least sometimes it 's not * that * bad . 
  you will definitely find plenty of people at any university with whom you can converse in english . 
  but unlike most of the rest of europe it 's not nearly everyone . 
   what 's wrong with atheism and agnosticism ? 
  mh , what do you mean ? 
  does `` at best '' carry a negative connotation ?
