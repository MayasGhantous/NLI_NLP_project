  no argument there . 
  it was a difficult decision , people were already throwing a fit over having their national law-making dictated , i guess the troika did n't dare to micromanage the health-care system , but stating the general demand of `` cut health care spending to x % '' when there is an inefficient and corrupt system in place to begin with , well ... 
  i guess the resulting disaster was inevitable . 
  whatever brought these problems , i do still think they need to ramp up health care spending , with outside help if necessary . 
  we should have went with the haircut from day one , i do n't know how anyone could seriously have ever believed greece would recover within a couple years and then happily pay all those extra debts back . 
   i 'm not trying to defend people bribing in the healthcare system , i 'm only saying that this particular death can be directly attributed to the austerity cuts . 
  can you come up with any proof for that claim ? 
  not that i would n't believe you , but others in this thread are saying there never was a lot of health care coverage for perpetually unemployed citizens even before the crisis . 
  all i know is that spending on preventative medicine and hospital staff and equipment were cut , i have n't read about anything relating to ( life-preserving ! ), 
  prescription drugs ( tbh i have n't been paying particular attention either , though ) . 
  the greek government could have done all this by themselves , but they chose not to . 
  the eu offered an alternative , athens took it . 
  greek politicians are ** at least ** as much to blame for greece 's current misery as is brussels . 
  of course how the eu reacted further was a major factor , but greece did have options and alternatives . 
  when a national government declares all debts to be void , they are gone , just like that , there would n't need to be eu approvement , same for abolishing the currency within the country . 
  would she have gotten the medicine for free before the cuts to the health care system enforced by the troika ? 
  whatever the case , while i can see the reasoning behind austerity measures , i never understood how it could be a good idea to slash health care spending ( and investments in education , for that matter ) as was done in the crisis , that 's * the * perfect recipe to get your educated and wealthy packing and leave the country . 
  sure , tell the greeks they only get money if they cut back on military spending , fight corruption , force citizens to pay their due taxes etc. , but if you safe on the doctors and teachers the country wo n't ever recover . 
  health and education are imho areas where the eu should * increase * their redistribution efforts , our poor countries on the continent need to become more attractive for the `` elite '' , which they wo n't ever be without at least a few premium hospitals and schools . 
  what point do all those new highways and general infrastructure projects and stuff which we pay to be built in the east serve if we ca n't get anyone to actually want to live there . 
   those who do n't do humour for a living are massively unfunny . 
  depends on how much you enjoy plain , old toilet humour . 
  from my experience with welsh and englanders at least . 
  i was joking , sorry . 
  germany ca n't into humour . 
  does this mean scotland can into eu ? 
   while i should not have said that , it was that dismissiveness and the fact that the german government is demanding that the us grant germans special rights that germany wo n't grant to the us pushed me over the edge . 
  i am sorry for generalizing , but those two factors set me off . 
  obviously that was n't realistic criticism just something said in anger . 
  must have been a really silly argument between you two , considering the nsa and the bnd are sharing a huge portion of their info gained by surveillance anyway . 
  a habit that just somehow stuck after the cold war , i guess . 
  i must admit i 'm not aware of any * recent * issues people would have with canada ? 
  also of course only a small minority can afford to wear a seal coat , i do believe nowadays a considerable portion of german citizens are opposed to wearing fur altogether . 
   20 % of germans and 13 % of spaniards have mainly negative views of canada 's influence - that seems very high . 
  is it the seal hunt thing ? 
  must be . 
  but to be fair , 20 % is still a far cry from a mostly negative opinion , almost anyone i know endorses canada whenever the topic pops up somehow . 
  respectable ? 
  certainly . 
  well-paid ? 
  maybe . 
  much sought-after by employers ? 
  probably not , i 'm afraid . 
  but if you 're really well-versed in three languages you should find your respectable job eventually . 
  they probably wo n't immediately boot you out of the country if you do n't meet all those criteria though ... 
  i 'm afraid getting a decent job with merely a bachelor in a `` soft science '' is probably even more difficult in germany than it already is in the anglosphere . 
  i would n't go so far as to say there are n't some niches somewhere for you , especially since knowing multiple languages is always a big bonus , but i could n't give you any specific pointers for where to look either . 
  well , maybe you could try to contact some museums or something ? 
  at least for an internship to do some networking and to get ideas for where to go from there ? 
  sorry , that 's as far as my imagination goes . 
   the level of unemployment has been skewed in the netherlands by governmental institutions . 
  just as in pretty much any other country , here in germany they do the exact same . 
  the number of unemployed ( and `` unemployable '' ) individuals is huge everywhere , and just constantly growing . 
  we 've simply become too productive to need everyone working a full-time job , but people are still ignoring that fact even as it 's becoming more and more obvious . 
  depends on his qualifications and where he would move to . 
  some of the large cities are fairly accommodating even for foreigners who do n't speak german , and for some high end science / it / engineering jobs you 're required to speak english at the workplace anyway . 
   she 'll end up either contradicting the impression she gave earlier or saying she gave in to cameron 's threats . 
  as if angela `` turnaround '' merkel ever cared about what her past self said a week ago . 
  nonsense , the very same people grow up to churn away at their workplace like the rest of us does . 
  it 's not like new children would grow up to be consumers without doing anything productive throughout their lives . 
   ... with our own ** spanish deck ** i like how self-explanatory the suits are . 
  one of the greatest cultural victories of the french - their traditional card set is so widespread many people do n't even realize there are other `` general purpose '' card decks . 
  which is one of the few german card games still played exclusively with the german deck . 
  most widespread games are nowadays preferentially played with french cards . 
  i like that the map shows various overseas territories , those are usually missing on any eu-wide map / statistic . 
  that 's really doubly as much a shame in the case of italy , one of the most common positive things i tend to hear about italians is how child-friendly they are . 
  in germany we just barely improved within the last half a century from beating our children senseless to kind of ignoring and accepting them as a necessary nuisance . 
  good job , guys . 
  seriously . 
   italy ca n't even protect it 's own coats from north african immigrants . 
  `` damn immigrants , i just washed my coat yesterday ! '', 
  oh , yeah , i kind of missed the snipped quote . 
  moar money plz . 
  yet all south-tyrolians with whom i 've spoken about the subject would greatly prefer independence ( not that half a dozen people would be representative of course ) . 
  yet i highly doubt there is some great masterplan running in the background as you seem to imply . 
  whenever connections between a corrupt politician and a private company surface , it 's a different cooperation or an entirely different field of industry . 
  i 'm not aware of any serious indication about there being some kind all-encompassing cartel pulling the strings in the country , there are too many competing players in the market . 
  the only halfway serious suspicions in recent years were the financial sectors dictating how to rescue the near-bankrupt countries in the crisis , but even then i find it hard to believe there was a long-lasting plan to create the crisis in the first place . 
  especially since the big banks really would n't have much of an interest in draining skilled workforce from portugal , they can just as easily open an office in lisbon , only engineering firms would potentially profit from your brain-drain , but those were just as much endangered by the crisis as anyone else in the first place . 
  you ca n't tell me there was a concerted effort from banks , industry and engineering companies in bed with corrupt politicians to manufacture a crisis where they somehow just might profit form in the end by the means of braindrain and higher interest rates and getting bailed out or whatever , that 's just absolutely ridiculous . 
  dude , chill out , you talk as if portugal was a broken third-world country . 
  the problems are probably temporary , and brain-drain is always a problem when there are greener pastures around . 
  we had the very same issue here after the war , when many of our most brilliant heads did n't want to to stick around cleaning up the rubble and going to bed hungry for it , and left for the us or whatever . 
  also you give our politicians too much credit for supposedly planning some kind of hostile takeover years in advance . 
  there is no german conspiracy going on , just some opportunist politicians being in charge at the right/wrong time . 
  as if we germans of all people could complain about convoluted and inconsistent grammatical rules in other languages ... 
  populism strikes again . 
  taking the beer to the computer desk ? 
  this is madness !, 
  you could spill some on your keyboard !, 
  seriously ? 
  how would brussels enforce a european federation against an unwilling , seceding country ? 
   - no washing up allowed to be hung up on a sunday i actually did n't know that . 
  good thing i 've only ever hung up my stuff in the house , as i most commonly do my washing on sundays . 
  and i know how much people here love to call the coppers on your ass whenever they get the chance . 
  yeah , i guess it really depends on how you define the overall difficulty of a language . 
  taking the first steps in german is easy due to the clear phonetics and compound words with often clear etymology , but mastering german is very difficult with the random genders and complicated cases . 
  when people want to learn a language they generally want to be fluent and free of grammatical mistakes in the end , and that 's quite a monumental task in german and something very few foreign learners ever manage to achieve . 
  i must admit i know nothing about bulgaria other than it being a poor country somewhere in the east . 
  i could n't even pinpoint it on a map , i know nothing about their language , culture , customs , cuisine , or climate .
