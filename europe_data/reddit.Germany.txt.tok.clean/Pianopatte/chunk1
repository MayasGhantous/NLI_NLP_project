they have n't dealt with their communist past and distanced itself from it . 
  and what is bad about the communist part of their past ? 
  i can understand that they should deal with the stalinistic methods the sed used ( which they did ) but just being a communist is nothing bad . 
   die linke , even to this day , can not what negative do they hold onto ? 
  as far as i understand them they are very much against state surveillance and such things opposite to merkel . 
  what nope ? 
  dont know if you are joking but poland together with germany is part of central europe . 
  edit . 
  if you look for the definition of central europe you will find that poland is a part of it, 
  and there we are back to my main problem . 
  how do you prove that they consent to the sex ? 
  okay then lets call it an intimate area and sure people have different definitions for them . 
  its not weird if you dont want to get touched somewhere were you dont like being touched . 
  we call it sexual assault when the assault is of a intimate area or mainly when its done with an sexaul intention . 
  also please keep your imaginations for yourself . 
  you are not really making sense . 
   you can abuse a animal , not rape him . 
  thats just your opinion . 
  we have laws for our protection . 
  there are laws against torture and anyone who still does it breaks them . 
  there is no excuse . 
  also laughing about prison rapes is wrong and has to do with us not treating inmates as human but as nothing more than criminals deserving punishment . 
  but it doesnt change the fact that we want to protect people ( and animals ) from getting raped . 
  dictionaries have no authority . 
  they do not affect what words mean and they dont influence how people use those words . 
  they only capture their meaning for a short time . 
  a dictonary from hundred years is worthless when interacting with todays soceity . 
  that being said you cant just say common sense always has been formed by the people and their morals . 
  its rational to shoot down the plane that will crash into a skyscrapper but its not common sense !, 
   the speculation that at least ** some ** animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship whats with the rest , how do you protect them ? 
  now you are playing the idiot ... 
  there is a mighty difference between my ear and my asshole . 
  one is seen as normal body part and the other is catogerized as sexual organ . 
  its only sexual assault if she rubs her tits on my ear and i dont like it . 
  only if the majority wants it so and in denmark it seems they rather protect animals from abuse . 
   man fondling his wife while she sleeps : rape , wife fondling her husband 's balls while he sleeps : affectionate . 
  i \u00b4 ve never heard of someone being persecuted because of something like this . 
  also even in a relationship you ask for consent . 
  like i told my gf to keep her hands away from my asshole and she does even when i sleep . 
   because they ca n't protest to an orgasm wut ? 
  also i wonder what would get more laughs from an audience . 
   laws are arbitrary so laws against murder , torture and rape are not based on rationality ? 
  also i mean you saying that you cant rape an animal . 
  well , i believe you can . 
   that is why humans will never evolve above the rank of social animal to that of rational animal . 
  and thats a bad thing because i cant sense your stance on it . 
  so why does every culture has different definitions of common sense ? 
  why was it different 100 years ago and will be completely different in 100 years ? 
  common sense is a construct not a natural law . 
  you may call it rational to not forbid sex with animals and passed out women who wanted to have sex with you . 
  i do not . 
   arbitrary man , you throw that word around a lot . 
  what you define as arbitrary is for the most common sense ;d  you ca n't rape a animal  ) it 's not human . 
  again thats you opinion shared by only a few . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_sense first sentence . 
  well , at least you have humor . 
  you mean your pets ? 
  sorry but i couldnt stop myself . 
   do you get paid for attacking people for no reason ? 
  nope its my hobby , especially when its so easy ... / s stop being such a sissy , this is what you get on the internet for having such controversial opinion . 
   common sense ** common ** sense . 
  common , do you even understand that part ? 
  common sense is what majority of thinks is right . 
  not what you think is right . 
  i for example think your sense of rape is complete bollocks . 
  yeah , `` nature '' doesnt enforce anything its just there . 
  dying of thirst might be my fault but it isnt any punishment . 
  going to jail for raping an animal is . 
  you know what ? 
  you dont get to decide that . 
  as long as you live in a fricking democracy the majority of people get to decide that . 
  go somewhere like siberia or antartica where there are no laws or stupid people who make them and do whatever you want . 
  what ??!, 
  really ?!, 
  i wouldnt have thought that someone that thinks having sex with passed out people isnt rape would be anything else than mr.sunshine himself ... 
   culture ca n't be contrary to nature because we ca n't abide by it then nonsense , nature is chaos , culture is order . 
  culture is a human construct and everything we create , nature is everything that is created without our actions . 
   against someones will and without it when it comes to sex there just isnt any difference . 
  if the chick falls asleep before we can get to it then its not just poor tast if i still fuck her . 
  also sorry but i find it hard being polite to advocates of rape . 
   modern western feminism is retarded you really sound like a pleasant fellow . 
   stupid people based more on prejudice than actual knowledge thats like totally your strange opinion . 
  also of course laws are not natural , they are a human invention to make our lives safer . 
  culture is the opposite of nature . 
  all i take from your words is that you want to live as an animal . 
  yeah , it just seems that the majority is against such things . 
  well , i follow the simple rule of : if the person/creature you want to fuck cant give you its consent then its illegal to still do so . 
  also we only intefere with other people lives if they hurting something . 
  yeah , we can already guess what you like fucking ... also what does her knowing you or how you get there make a difference ? 
  true , when i first got a smartphone i wondered why it only lasted a day until i realized that i never used my old phone more than for a few minutes per day . 
  well , but for the majority of people being able to use the internet everywhere they go is the main selling point . 
  god , he said that if people really cared about co2 they would change their habits . 
  but because they dont they dont care about co2 and so they dont care whatever energy is there . 
  the problem is that a party which is for nuclear energy wont be elected anymore so deep is the sentiment against it here in germany . 
  when i said to my friends that i am for nuclear energy they looked at me like i was hitler himself . 
   the deal was not halted , but put on hold and still can be completed any moment . 
  are you serious ? 
  halted literaly means `` put on hold '' . 
  also you know that calling the deal off means that the french people have to shoulder the bill ? 
  thats not an easy decission especially when its because of a country that isnt even in the eu .
