that 's a decision made by a court in 21th century central europe . 
  notice the place and time . 
  it 's ** very ** important !, 
  there are relevant things called * context * and * purpose * which appear not to be taken so much in consideration by many redditors here . 
  the niqab , because of its symbolism and its lack of social/health benefits , hardly fits the standards upon which the french society has developed and thanks to which it flourishes . 
  it 's also unlikely that it could play any significant role in improving the well-being of its ( lady ) citizens . 
  making sure that every person can be recognized in the streets for public safety reasons is an issue for you ? 
  do you live in airstripe one ? 
  are there `` finger men '' roaming the streets detaining those who violate the curfew ? 
  probably not . 
  and unless we 're developing into such terrible society or that 's already the reality , we should try to keep things in balance . 
  probably you live in a society where putting on a balaclava is n't associated to ill intent , provided it 's cold or you are going to a fancy dress party . 
  it 's a matter of dressing accordingly . 
  you would n't see me wearing a ku klux klan garment anywhere at anytime , if you ask me . 
  on a related issue : once i saw this british girl who , along with her mum , had ( then ) recently converted to islam , saying on tv that the veil gave her the * freedom * to choose which man could see her . 
  if there 's any psychologist here , i 'd really like to know your informed opinion regarding her statement . 
  ** edit : ** same message , improved writing . 
  french cassoulet au canard und german beer ftw, 
  that 's a nice picture of borderless europe . 
  i was living in a border city last year . 
  currently living in one now . 
  will be moving to yet another next month . 
  i love this sort of stuff ( two cultures very close together ) . 
  i do hope it will continue this way for a veeery long time . 
  been there . 
  seen that . 
  along with basel , geneva is cursed by the `` foreign commuters ' ebbing syndrome '' , which causes those places to be more boring than they should after 6pm . 
  terrible thing , really . 
  currently living in breisach am rhein - germany . 
  our french neighbours often cross the border to shop for groceries here . 
  ** including ** baguette and cheese . 
  i call that european integration . 
  i do n't know if that 's in the study , but i already heard from a number of caterers that many restaurants will throw away food because `` it 's cheaper to buy one kilo of tomatoes than to pay 10 minutes of a kitchen assistant 's work to pack and store the leftovers '' . 
  terribly pernicious principle . 
  i have n't read the study yet , so i 'm wondering if they also included the food which is wasted in restaurants into the equation . 
  any person who has ever worked in the catering industry knows that ** obscene ** amounts of food are wasted there . 
  * thanks for the advice !, 
  i just noticed the existence of the megathread . 
   we are immigrants !, 
  we need to go !, 
  open the border !, 
  [ ... ] if you need to kill us we are ready !, 
  we are ready to die !, 
  it seems that shaking hands and having a nice chat was out of question . 
  thanks for link , * cher redditeur * !, 
  awfully lazy map makers in `` action '' there ... 
  they were right in tainting the northern borders orange , but hell not the rest of the country yellow . 
  it 's utterly absurd to put cities like [ balne\u00e1rio cambori\u00fa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balne%c3%a1rio_cambori%c3%ba ) , [ florian\u00f3polis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florian%c3%b3polis ) and [ campos do jord\u00e3o ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/campos_do_jord%c3%a3o ) on the same basket with salvador , macei\u00f3 and s\u00e3o paulo . 
  no way . 
  he simply asked me to explain my reasons * in a polite manner * , and took his time to read what i 've written . 
  you , on the other hand , have chosen to do none of that . 
  very well . 
   it 's nice that you have an opinion but i do n't really care about your prophecies . 
  give some reason for your opinion ... 
  if you 're still interested , you could read the answer i 've provided to [ / u/sweatybadgers ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/sweatybadgers ) question right above . 
  there i 've explained my reasoning . 
  well ... 
  yes : the eu needs some reforms . 
  there have been many developments in europe during this past decade and we risk seeing it breaking apart in the next 3 years if no change is implemented or , at the very least , proposals for reforms wo n't be thoroughly discussed . 
  and along comes david cameron ( and the conservative party ) , who 's very good at changing policies as soon as they become unpopular and who also tends to follow opinions rather than leading them . 
  in 2013 , at the height of the anti-assad sentiment , cameron went to the parliament to propose a military action against syria . 
  a majority of only 13 mps prevented that from happening . 
  on the following year , isis came along and proved themselves even worse that assad . 
  the west attacked isis , and by doing so , helped to keep assad in power , as isis was also fighting against him . 
  now assad is just tolerated , as he 's helping to keep isis from expanding into syria . 
  so much for cameron 's consistency . 
  for the economic affairs , he appointed george osborne , who sees no problem in announcing that the economy is growing while not mentioning that real wages are going down . 
  he also set the nation into a bloody austerity programme while injecting billions of pounds into the economy through a process called quantitative easing ( basically transferring money from the bottom 95 % to the top 5 % ) . 
  returning to cameron , he just recently suggested withdrawing from the european convention on human rights , one of the core conventions of post-wwii europe , and itself a document of which the ratification is ** required ** when a country seeks eu membership . 
  now he 's travelling around europe proposing to officialise the uk 's status of `` honorary member '' of the eu ( which is technically what the uk has with its opt-outs ) . 
  that proposal will be discussed under the shadow of a referendum , which he himself proposed ( * delivering what the majority wants * , as you have put ) . 
  i think , first of all , we should ask ourselves a very important question , which is especially relevant when it comes to politics and politicians . 
  it 's a question about maintaining balance . 
  and the question is : what conditions are you willing to accept in order the have what you want ? 
  you could answer `` that depends . 
  i would not support a party which vows to raise the minimum salary by 15 % while proposing to privatise the nhs . 
  however , i would vote for a party which vows to cut train fares by a half while privatising our roads . 
  this seems reasonable to me '' . 
  now , is it really worth keeping as prime minister a man who , through his actions and the support of the tories , has been ( a ) transferring obscene amounts of money to the rich , ( b ) tried to drive the country to another armed conflict overseas ( despite the apocalyptic failure of the previous one ) and ( c ) sees fit to withdraw from the echr , if that would mean ( d ) securing that referendum and/or ( e ) changing the relation that the uk maintains with the eu ? 
  do you think that 's a good deal ? 
  about the tarnishing : he may now be doing fine to a tory 's eye , but this will change the moment the eu referendum is done , and more people realise that cameron has taken more than given . 
  and i 'm not talking about corruption . 
  just ask yourself why the concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 5 % has increased since cameron became prime minister , look for the answers and maybe you 'll understand why i hold that opinion . 
  cheers . 
  ** edit : ** spelling, 
  i do indeed !, 
  that 's why i 've drawn the comparison . 
  ok ... cameron is n't quite the pillock that blair was ( and is ) , but my point is that , though cameron seems to be doing great for the uk now , after his term as pm is over , people will look back and say `` what the hell were we thinking when we supported that man ?! '', 
  ** edit : ** spelling, 
  cameron is doing a much better job at tarnishing ( even more ) the reputation of the tories than tony blair did to the labour party . 
  and in the end , the whole kingdom pays the price . 
  [ some screenwriters of american movies may disagree ] ( https://youtu.be/ok-edkhbypy?t=26s ) , unfortunately . 
  i sympathize with you , meu caro . 
  that 's too good for him . 
  he 's likely to become russia 's next minister for sport !, 
  you should have seized the opportunity and post it yourself then , if you think it fits there . 
  this sub does n't exist !, 
  nice joke !, 
  haha hey ?!, 
  why did i lose karma ?
