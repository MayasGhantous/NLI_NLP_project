  hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha !, 
  ** edit : ** eli5 : how can blatter say that with a straight face ? 
  very good point . 
  unfortunately mr walter de gregorio failed to consider it so important as to include it in his statement ... ... or maybe he just did n't want to give any more trouble to fifa 's pr agents , who must be having a hell of a day . 
  i wonder what the prs from interpol , [ which received 20 million euros from fifa to finance a project called `` integrity in sport '' ] ( http://www.interpol.int/crime-areas/integrity-in-sport/integrity-in-sport ) , will say about this case . 
  ** edit : ** here 's [ the link to interpol 's news and media ] ( http://www.interpol.int/news-and-media/media-room ) , in case anyone 's interested in knowing what they find worth publishing there . 
  lovely headline by the new york times !, 
   ... ; * sepp blatter is n't among them * somehow implying that he should have been . 
  that 's brilliant !, 
  get him behind bars , boys !, 
  the usa , the netherlands , the uk and germany happen to occupy , respectively , the 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 4th place in the list of countries which have initiated isds cases worldwide in 2012 . 
  meanwhile , american companies , of which the home country has active bits with 41 other countries , 12 ftas which include investment protection and [ u$ 4.38 trillion in direct investments abroad ( in 2012 ) ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/188571/united-states-direct-investments-abroad-since-2000/ ) have opened [ 123 isds cases in 2012 ] ( http://www.bdi.eu/images_content/globalisierungmaerkteundhandel/bdi_facts_and_figures_international_investment_agreements.pdf ) alone , whereas the companies from your `` hypocritical '' germany , a country with  14 agreements including isds within the eu alone ( basically all with poorer countries ) , and dozens more around the world . 
  and [ u$ 1,23 trillion in direct investments abroad ( in 2012 ) ] ( http://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/en/pressemitteilungen/bbk/2013/2013_09_27_germanys_international_investment_position_at_the_end_of_2012.html ) opened but 27 cases in 2012 . 
  that makes what ? 
  1 case for every u$ 28 bi . 
  for the us against 1 for every 22 bi . 
  for germany . 
  a reasonable difference in behaviour , do n't you think ? 
  this index is not quite the best we can use , as i just pointed out to [ / u/claerc ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/claerc ) , but since we are comparing two major exporting countries , it 's not so bad either . 
  also , why citing the netherlands especifically when you were criticizing germany 's position in the first place ? 
  i fail to see the relevance of both the `` isds cases * per * gdp '' index and `` isds cases * per capta * '' index . 
  yeah . 
  it 's much easier to find those numbers you 've brought up ** but ** , would n't you maybe agree that an `` isds cases per bit signed '' index or - to be even more specific - `` isds cases by fdi in countries with which bits containing an isds clause have been signed '' be more relevant ? 
  this is n't overcomplication . 
  even an isds * per * fdi would be more relevant ( even though it would not be ideal , as the proportion of the fdi related to bits varies between countries ) why should someone use gdp instead of the value of the investments in foreign countries by companies , which is actually what the isds is designed to protect ? 
  congratulations on your efforts to get well informed . 
  you should therefore know that the usa is ** the main ** initiator of isds cases in the world , [ having in 2012 initiated more cases than germany , the netherlands and the uk combined ] ( http://unctad.org/en/publicationslibrary/webdiaepcb2013d3_en.pdf ) , uhm ? 
  you may argue that they were mostly against developing countries , but then you must also consider that the few european countries the usa filed cases against were those they had/have bilateral agreements signed with . 
  and no , none of those countries was an original member of the eu . 
  also , can anyone in all seriousness compare any of the agreements ( containing an isds clause ) signed between germany and other countries with something of the scale of the ttip ? 
  ** edit ** : spelling, 
  i do n't know about you , but i have a problem with the isds clause . 
  i see it as a mechanism which can ( and is ! ), 
  all too easily be used to subdue democracies to the desires of corporations and investors more than they already are . 
  the argument that it is commonplace in existing trade and investment agreements is rubbish . 
  let me put it in another way : i do n't want to see any american corporation suing the eu because they believe our regulations are causing the former to lose profit ( and i bet the americans would n't like to have siemens or alstom doing that against them either ) . 
  bollocks to that . 
  it 's already complicated enough to keep things running smoothly under the ( cleverly written ) tfeu . 
  why should we put leeches in our pool ? 
  to make the swimming more interesting ? 
  \u2191 another participant has just joined . 
  edit : i honestly do n't believe that more transparency would improve anything . 
  the agreement is essentially rotten . 
  having the cards on the table facing up only makes intentions clear , and now it 's just a matter of acting accordingly . 
  seeing those lads chasing a cheese rolling downhill like a pack of mad bloodhounds is a clear sign that spring has arrived in gloucestershire !, 
  people may say varoufakis is arrogant , agressive , lacking political skills or whatever shit to depreciate the man . 
  one thing no one can say , though , is that he 's fooling around . 
  ** edit : ** a word . 
  that 's if delloite or pwc or whatever company providing amazon with tax ~ ~ avoidance advice ~ ~ advisory wo n't find a way to help them beat the eu taxman yet again . 
  [ that 's true ] ( http://www.internationaloliveoil.org/estaticos/view/131-world-olive-oil-figures ) . 
  it just happens that i 've been to set\u00fabal recently and would hate to see that region suffering because of some nasty disease . 
  i actually hope they will find a way to contain the spreading asap . 
  not to mention that olive oil is an important element in the diet of so many europeans . 
  just picture that in almost every supermarket of portugal and spain , you can find 5-litre olive oil bottles for sale ... 
  i saw a coverage about this disease a few weeks ago in arte journal . 
  seems to be ( but hopefully not ) an equivalent to the `` witch 's broom '' disease that affected the cacao plantations in brazil , as it 's both terribly damaging and really hard to contain . 
  if this shit manages to reach set\u00fabal ( in portugal ) , things will get really , really bad . 
  that 's true . 
  it even preceeds the treaty of rome . 
  what i meant , though , is that the echr 's ( the treaty , not the court ... ... but , of course , also the court ... ) represents - or embodies - core values of the eu when it comes to human rights . 
  to my eyes , eu membership without ratification of the echr is simply unconceivable . 
  having spent 2 amazing years in the uk , i hold great affection for that union of countries as well as for those who live there . 
  it would be sad to see them leaving the union . 
  however , if their citizens , through their elected representatives , will continue to see fit opting-out from many core agreements of the european union , such as the charter of fundamental rights ( fuck all the overtime and holidays i had to work without earning extra !, 
  ) , the area of freedom , security and justice and ( why not throw in the basket ) shengen , and now the echr , imho it would be better to let the uk leave the eu and simply have it as a member of the european customs union ( which is n't actually so bad ... ) . 
  with its 42 years of membership , the united kingdom has never aspired to become a full member of the eu , but rather to hold a position of `` honorary member '' . 
  ( if anyone here has studied the history of the eu more than i did and has a different view on that issue , please , make your voice heard . ),

  can someone explain how this happened ? 
  this tree may be found next to [ a trail leading to the top of mont veyrier ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/annecy-le-vieux,+france/@45.9032268,6.1644837,1157m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x478b8f964ffe920b:0x9f9db935233f44c0 ) , for those who are climbing from the north-east side . 
  while armed conflicts and poverty may push individuals and families out of their homes , smugglers will push them towards specific places . 
  the idea of going to europe , in many cases specifically to germany , does n't simply appear inside the migrant 's / refugee 's brain . 
  individuals making a business out of other people 's misfortune suggest them to come to here . 
  and as long as a decent effort is n't made to disrupt those networks , things are likely to get much worse . 
  having already donated blood in england , france and germany , i 've noticed ( or felt ? ), 
  a ** huge ** difference regarding the way donors are ( likely to be ) treated . 
  let 's take the efs cabanel ( in paris ) for example . 
  that 's where i had my best experiences so far . 
  the people are absurdly kind to you from beginning to end . 
  if they could , i think they would carry you in their arms . 
  the nurses are very gentle and will check you every five minutes . 
  they 'll offer you nice meals ( * \u00e0 la carte !, 
  * ) and snacks , a cozy environment and a bottle of perrier water before you leave `` to keep you hydrated '' . 
  you ** do ** feel like returning whenever you are ready for another donation ( so much so , in fact , that i 've been there already 7 times ) . 
  lyon gerland is already a bit different .
