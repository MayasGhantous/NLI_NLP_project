  people there are also very kind , but they 'll only spend so much time with you . 
  the place is more like a hospital and , after the donation , you can enjoy a buffet similar to a breakfast in a ibis budget hotel , with lots of meat and dairy products . 
  i 've already unsubscribed from their newsletter twice , but i keep receiving requests to come and donate again even after 3 years . 
  they must be in some serious need . 
  in general , the french experience goes in the line of * `` it 's very nice that you 're doing this . 
  please , come back for another donation when you can . 
  we 'll be happy to see you again . 
  '' * in the west end donor centre in london , they have a different approach . 
  that 's a mass ~ ~ production ~ ~ blood collection centre , with lots of people coming and going , so there 's little time for kindness and talking . 
  the nurses are very nice to you , though . 
  as soon as you 're done , you 're offered a little snack and some beverages and off you go . 
  the londoner experience goes more in the line of * `` we really appreciate that you could come . 
  if you 're around and feeling like giving blood , do not hesitate to return . 
  ok , thanks , bye . 
  '' * in germany things are quite different . 
  for starters , you 're paid for it . 
  yes , it 's still called donation ( * spenden * ) , but not rarely you 'll be offered a monetary compensation for giving blood . 
  so far only the universit\u00e4tsklinikum freiburg the klinikum saarbr\u00fccken winterberg have taken my blood , and in both places i did n't have the feeling that my action was very much associated with a gesture of kindness . 
  by no means i wish to put people off from donating blood in those places ( or in germany for that matter ) but , for someone who already donated it in france , the german experience will feel quite straight and impersonal . 
  i guess we could define the german approach as * `` thanks for your contribution . 
  we expect to you to come back every few months . 
  take care and tchuss !, 
  from [ the wikipedia article on magnitogorsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magnitogorsk )  magnitogorsk was mentioned in the blacksmith institute 's 2007 survey of the world 's worst polluted cities , placed in the report 's unranked list of the 25 most polluted places outside the top ten . 
  pollutants include lead , sulfur dioxide , heavy metals and other air pollutants . 
  according to the local hospital , only 1 % of all children living in the city are in good health . 
  the blacksmith institute says that , according to a local newspaper report , `` only 28 % of infants born in 1992 were healthy , and only 27 % had healthy mothers '' better get hold of a hazmat suit before traveling to that enchanting place , i say . 
  that 's cheating , mate . 
  * there 's wisdom in this ranking *, 
  we were playing with 5 letters each . 
  but those awful sets of letters + we all being quite tired resulted in the game ending prematurely . 
  6 points with a 2-letter word is a fine deal . 
  when playing such game with family , we tend to be more flexible . 
  tiny game , mostly . 
  the hand being close to the camera somewhat added to the `` giant-hand effect '' .

  i 'm sorry to hear that , mate . 
  was n't the working time directive 2003/88/ec supposed to prevent this sort of shit from happening ? 
  or the uk opted-out from this one ?

  well said !, 
  i heard arte spends more $ s relative to their average audience than any other european channel . 
  when it comes to investing in the production of quality content , they do n't fool around . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  what a difference a small * serif * on a `` consonant '' can have !, 
  i guess my russian friends do n't have such a good ear for accents , then . 
  pronouncing `` h\u00e1s '' instead of `` g\u00e9s '' is not exactly a * subtle * difference . 
  the other one , [ which looks like a witch riding a pig ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/49/86/21/4986213d3c54083e05aa88aada044b33.jpg ) . 
  this seems to apply also to that island east of eire . 
  unfortunately i do n't . 
  at least not yet . 
  do you think you could use the [ international phonetic alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_phonetic_alphabet ) to show that difference in a given example ? 
  ** edit : ** cyrillic would do too . 
  will do . 
   and odessian russian is actually a very special type of russian . 
  could you elaborate on that ? 
  do you happen to know if that applies to ukrainians whose * first * language is russian ? 
  that 's a reasonable start .

  well ... those are not intellectually dishonest people talking rubbish there . 
  ** maybe ** you could dismiss this video , as you so unapologetically did , if that was the case . 
  by choosing to provide shallow and false descriptions of chomsky and varoufakis , instead of pointing out inconsistencies in their speech , all you 're doing is exposing your cognitive biases . 
  nothing more . 
  have you been reading ayn rand lately ? 
  just curious . 
  do yourself a favour and change your opinion in that regard . 
  really . 
  you will feel better . 
  i 'm fairly sure that there are many interesting stories and curious facts involving such towns and their relation with their neighbours which the general public is n't aware of . 
  could you share one ( or more ) ? 
  and in case you actually live in one , what is , in your opinion , the greatest ( or worst ) thing about living there ? 
  i fairly recently been told by some russian friends that , when it comes to guessing where a native russian speaker is from by his/her accent , you simply can not . 
  there 's no difference between the russian spoken in vladivostok , astana and odessa . 
  the best one can do is to guess whether a person comes from the countryside or from a bigger city ( because of the vocabulary used ) . 
  i was amazed by that . 
  in much smaller countries like england , france and portugal , there will be pronounced accent variations every 100km or less in any direction . 
  how come this is not the case with russian ? 
  and are there other examples of european languages with little to no dialectal variation ?
