  the revolutions inspired lasting reform in denmark , as well as the netherlands . 
  maybe they were struck down and the participants therefore felt that they had failed , but there was `` great change '' . 
  i do n't think it 's likely that anything will change in ukraine with this government , so as long as they are in place , no revolution . 
  i think g_morgan meant figurative guillotines . 
  a revolution is 1 . 
  a political upheaval in a government or nation state characterized by great change . 
  the removal and replacement of a government . 
  the old government is still in place , so it 's not a revolution ( yet ) . 
  you 're preaching to the choir . 
  but there 's obviously a religious reason . 
  again , religion should never stand in the way of reducing violence and suffering , and therefore it should be illegal to circumcise children for religious reasons . 
  i just wanted to point out that children `` do not have any right over their own bodies '' in all kinds of different situations that are n't controversial at all . 
   boys do not have any right over their own bodies which is pretty much true for all children . 
  if a kid does n't want braces , the parents should n't accept that . 
  and if you 're deeply religious , not being circumcised is probably as bad as having crooked teeth . 
  i 'm all for making religiously motivated circumcisions of children illegal , i 'm just saying that it 's a complicated issue . 
  from the article :  the solidarity fund [ ... ] has disbursed 3.5 billion euros to 23 countries . 
  i agree . 
  i 'm not sure what i should think of things like gender quotas , but there 's definitely too much bashing on successful business women in there , as if they were all exact copies of the same stereotype . 
  still , the image he paints of von der leyen seems plausible to me , and the process of politicians pushing their agenda against any reasoning or technicalities can be observed in the discussions in germany around data retention , the foreigner maut , various huge construction projects , and many other things . 
  me too !, 
  she looks and talks like a control freak . 
  she very much reminds me of a few teachers i had , who could scream the whole class into instant submission . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.danisch.de/blog/2011/06/21/wie-die-deutsche-internet-kinderpornosperre-zustande-kam-und-zugrunde-ging/ ) are some insights from someone who worked with her .

  it 's also important to understand that finding out if a video contains copyrighted material is everything but easy . 
  even if you could come up with a complete list of every song and performer in every video ( which is rightout impossible ) , you 'd still have to find out the copyright status of each performance . 
  gema is known to be stuck in the '80s with their bureaucracy , meaning there 's actual * paper * work and snail mail and everything . 
  gema makes it impossible to build a system that automatically filters hours of data per minute . 
  google 's fault : their filter sucks . 
  gema 's fault : no interest in incorporating new technology and culture . 
  even [ sony said gema is costing them millions ] ( http://torrentfreak.com/sony-music-boss-censored-youtube-videos-cost-us-millions-120224/ ) . 
  as a policemen you ca n't tell your superior `` sorry , but i do n't like that order . 
  i 'm gon na sit here until you come up with a better one . '', 
  the laws they enforce * are * immoral , of course . 
  but what would happen if they would do the right thing and quit their job ? 
  this is a valid question . 
  do n't downvote unless you can come up with a valid answer . 
  me too . 
  i can recognize maybe five even though i 've been peeking at the tooltips in / r/europe for years . 
  i wish flag designers were a little more creative . 
  i like your flag . 
  it looks really upbeat . 
  nice change from the usual rectangles . 
  the answer would 've been something along the lines of : we ca n't let those entrusted with government secrets reveal them to the world ; people 's lives are at stake ; but whistleblowers generally play an important role and should be protected , < insert historic example of a popular whistleblower here  , yadda yadda ... 
  this kind of interview is pretty useless . 
  you get the general idea from reading everyday news and everything else is just presentation . 
  it would take hours of discussion and a rhetoric genius to get to the bottom of the answer to your question . 
  you * tried * to offend me . 
  and you failed ; i do n't feel offended at all . 
  no you ca n't . 
  that 's because being german and white is awesome . 
  you ca n't offend someone by stating that their life is great . 
  i envy you for that short moment . 
  cherish it . 
  oops . 
  sorry for digressing . 
  those are very small research projects that ca n't be compared to the complexity of the earth 's climate . 
  we can build [ asimo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asimo ) but we ca n't build isaac newton . 
  and even if we could tinker with the earth 's climate as we do with our air conditioner , it would take decades , centuries or even much longer to restart the golf stream , repair the monsoon systems or rebuild rainforests . 
  in the meantime , billions would starve or perish in the resulting ww3 . 
  your body did n't come with a lot of documentation , too , but you do n't start adding pipes and whistles everywhere to see what happens . 
  and why do n't you try building your body from scratch . 
  just reimplement with all the problems and shortcomings in mind , right ? 
  the earth is way more complex than anything you can describe in c , perl or haskell . 
  it has nothing to do with honesty . 
  your family member is exposed to a very small subset of data while employment statistics usually vary greatly between different regions . 
  everybody is subject to personal bias and nobody can turn it off , regardless of how trustworthy and noble they are . 
  there 's a reason scientifically relevant studies are expensive and take a lot of time . 
  if we could just ask some guy on reddit who they think is the most trustworthy person and then go and ask that person , we would save hundreds of billions on scientific research every year . 
  i 'm craving for fried islam with mixed religion stew on the side . 
  but i should n't gorge myself . 
   the only source i trust is a member of my family you should 've said so earlier . 
  if you regard anything and anyone but your family member as unrealiable , there is no point in arguing with you . 
  * please * , to save you and your opponents a lot of time , make it clear right at the beginning of any future discussions that there is only one person in the whole world who could change your mind . 
  unless you say who claimed such a thing , you are pulling a strawman . 
  i do n't understand your question . 
  why should n't there be any blue columns below the line ? 
   protect one 's culture from immigration immigration does n't necessarily replace parts of an existing culture , it adds to it . 
  nothing stops you from celebrating christmas just because your new neighbour celebrates silly hat day . 
  [ source ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-immigrants-pay/16332 )  when the blue columns are above the line , migrants are making a net contribution to the public finances . 
  gee , thanks a bunch . 
  you want me to lose poor , old necky ?

  alright , you won , i looked it up :  [ immigrants are generally net contributors to the british economy , paying more into the system in taxes than they take out by accessing public services .

  i did n't say you would , it was just an example as to what is inacceptable even with free speech . 
  if neil degrasse tyson would mock reddit , reddit users would n't stop visiting reddit . 
  they would simply dismiss him and find other idols . 
  thanks for your support . 
   i can kind of relate to the attitude towards islam in / r/reurope . 
  the islamist loudmouths really can make you hate them with your guts , even though they are a tiny minority . 
  but it 's sad how so many people do n't care about what causes extremism and instead fall back to stupid generalizations and stereotypes , which can push muslims even more towards extremist ideologies . 
  i agree . 
  as long as you do n't engage in hate speech ( `` do n't go to muslim stores '' , `` only a dead muslim is a good muslim '' , etc ) , you should be free to say whatever you want and anyone who threatens you should be judged by whatever laws your country has in place for this kind of thing . 
   islam however , is not a nice religion . 
  christianity , too , advocates all sorts of basic human rights violations .
