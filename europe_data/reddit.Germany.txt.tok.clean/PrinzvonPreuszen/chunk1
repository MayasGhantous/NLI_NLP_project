i thought being a weirdo is the whole point of being from belgium, 
  sumerian , akkadian , recently took a course in hessian to freshen it up, 
  this week to my landkreis * wohoo *, 
  you understand danish ? 
  do you also understand the growling of wolves or the sounds someone with throatcancer makes while choking on a potato ? 
  definitly [ l\u00fcneburg ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/skillshare%2c_alter_hafen_l%c3%bcneburg.jpg/1920px-skillshare%2c_alter_hafen_l%c3%bcneburg.jpg ) [ hann .

  [ maybe you 'd like to take a look at my post from a while ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5w4fty/nationalparks/ ), 
  americans trying to make beer , ^ ^ just ^ to ^ feed ^ the ^ circle ^ jerk, 
  why not piss both of and move it to eupen ? 
  [ san marino ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wappen_san_marinos#/media/file:flag_of_san_marino.svg ) looks nice , i like the light blue and white part with a nice coa edit : i ca n't spell, 
  how would a protestant who keeps his beliefs to himself fare ? 
  you dare to mention unofficial national anthems and even the proms and not mentioning rule britania ? 
  [ here 's a photo of kira finding out saltwater is n't potable ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/6iw0a5/kira_just_found_out_that_she_cant_drink_saltwater/ ) she 's an old-german herding dog . 
  she love 's to swim and ride the car , is really friendly with other dogs , and gives you paw in exchange for treats, 
  the next coronation will probably be in 70 years, 
  i 'm already learning accadian , i 'd like to learn old-egyptian or hittite too so i could speak four extinct mid-eastern languages, 
  borodino was n't really a victory for either side, 
  w\u00f6rk is the celebration, 
  nah we still need them, 
  people who shit in gorges , canyons valleys etc. 
  -- `` after swabians '' you wan na start a war brother ? 
  no , and if i did n't oppose death penalty so strongly i 'd say anyone who suggests this should get the axe 2 . 
  yes . 
  yes , is there another way ? 
  yes 5 . 
  not very often 6 . 
  what pool ? 
  sharpens axe, 
  inselaffen : brits ( it means island monkeys ) itakker : italians franzacken , froschfresser ( frog eaters ) : the french k\u00e4sk\u00f6ppe : the dutch ( means cheeseheads ) polacken : the polish schluchtenscheisser : austrians , bavarians ( gorgeshitters ), 
  that 's the wrong answer , you have to say : '' alesia ? 
  i do n't know anything called alesia ! '', 
  we 're planning on getting a garden for just that , but as we do n't have one right now we 're growing carrots and potatoes in the flat, 
  i have a rare hairy hippo ( which some people confuse with a dog ), 
  no that would be leicht , l\u00fct is northern dialect for smal, 
  when i took the survey the third answer on the china-qestion read one-child policy, 
  should n't it be `` abolish one china-policy '' instead of `` one child-policy '' ? 
  why not both ? 
  i read that he meant it in a ironic way, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://crazyhyena.com/imagebank/g/german_language.jpg ), 
  no , your `` language '' is not the product of throatcancer but of being dropped on the head as children, 
  that their language is considered german and not throatcancer , i 'm looking at you switzerland, 
  we are n't we actually like to rub one off to ourselves, 
  well they should either be given equal status or given independence or something, 
  kinda but i think some parts of france are over-sea departments and have the same rights as anyother department and uk-politics are just weird . 
  and look at them do you really wan na be part of that club ? 
  then the thirty years war does n't count either or the american civil war, 
  would the 1866 war count too ? 
  yeez colonies are so 19th/20th century, 
  also rollig means horny ( for cats ) in germany, 
  one and three the same as in swedish , knecht which is related to knight means servant . 
  dogge means big dogs like the great dane and is probably related with dog in english, 
  well that one between cologne and bonn, 
  the one that looks like a dark-blue bedsheet with the state seal on it, 
  only the knife ? 
  no alcohol , snow , contempt for russia/sweden ? 
  spoken is better than written tbh, 
  the parking lot of the local supermarket has a charging station for e-cars , also at the uni , but that 's it, 
  yeah those islands in the carribean and the pacific are the worst part, 
  both, 
  o.k if even the french think that the uk deserves better she must be really fucked up, 
  a dangerous asshat with a distaste for human and animal rights, 
  thanks but we 're rather the on-our-own explorers, 
  everyday , living together with a policeman, 
  zhat 's how ve plenned it all is p\u00f6rfect do n't qwestion zhe reich, 
  winks at austria ... wait a minute that probably would n't end to well . 
  how about switzerland they are basically quadrolingual germans taken to the extreme , but they probably would n't want to join , so i 'd say france : charlemagne / karl der gro\u00dfe stronk !, 
  you mean germany has no experience with empires ( reich in german ) ? 
  i am astonished no one has brought up r/floridaman yet, 
  well it 's an island, 
  does . . does [ borkum ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/borkum/@53.5028853,5.3979728,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c9e703aa7f713d:0x84246c2fcd810106!8m2!3d53.5973774!4d6.7180445?hl=de ) count ? 
  my english is either from ny jersey city or yonkers, 
  no , most people are making comments about other countries faring so much worse while they would n't get their arses up if germany was in a similiyar situation, 
  he 's talking about k\u00fcnast critizising the lethal force against that axe-guy in the train , which i think was not apropriate in that case yet she has any right to do so , as he has to critizise her . 
  and trying to get the `` parlamentsarmee '' in line with the ideas this country was founded upon , which some people fear , which is not happening , would not be the worst of all things, 
  ( with a totally not fake austrian accent ) yeah those damn liechtensteiners, 
  yes, 
  damn , that would have been funny, 
  you better get yourself a coast or leave reddit friendo, 
  do any republicans use the phrase `` better dead than red '' ? 
  you got ta drag me there : california , hawaii , new england , maybe somewhere in the north west you got ta drag me there and pay me : every thing that touches one of them big lakes borders mexico ( except texas ) or is called nevada , florida delaware or new jersey . 
  if it was populated by people i 'd get along with , why not ? 
  but it is n't so i 'd rather shoot myself : maryland , virginia , wv , kentucky , tennesee , nc , sc , georgia , alabama and missisipi . 
  i 'd rather drop dead : the rest, 
  i do n't know about a place called `` deutschland '' but in the state of mecklenburg-westpommerania there is the mecklenburg , in schleswig-holstein there is schleswig and in brandenburg there is brandenburg they are all eponymous, 
  german : native english : pretty fluent latin : got my `` latinum '' nur forgot pretty much french : started about one year ago sumerian started about a year ago akkadian : started this year, 
  is your city large and dirty too ? 
  lol because malta is small and has the whole mediteranean at it 's front door or because malta has n't to much ~ ~ sweet ~ ~ freshwater ? 
  your river sounds like a pretty medicore attempt to translate `` threesome '', 
  a sort of selfmade soup i make , it contains feta , noodles , carrots and potatoes, 
  yesterday my boyfriend ate my last cookie , so yes, 
  [ well that 's how you seen here , but you are known for banks , chocolate , cheese , watches , mountains too ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/eheu90i ), 
  i remember this one '' why do russians steal two cars in germany ? 
  because they have to go trough poland on their way back . '', 
  i 'm fine with our many names abroad but i 'm not fine with what comes out when someone from another country tries to say `` deutschland '', 
  new zealand or canada or maybe some french oversea bits or namibia, 
  [ you know this is already a thing ? ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ), 
  like that got never broken before, 
  `` lets go of alsace-lorraine '' we 're totally in for that,
