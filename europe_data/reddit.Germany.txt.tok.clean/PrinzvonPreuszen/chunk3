  there are so many crowns on this coa, 
  they make you a criminal #weilreinehautreinhaut, 
  i visit about every two months , but to be honest if it were n't for my baby-nephew and my father , who only since i moved out has recognized me as equal , i would n't visit at all . 
  i thought europe ended at the marmara-sea, 
  well my bf works at the `` police-callcentre '' so yes i call the police quite often, 
  we only eat like once a month at a restaurant . 
  we either cook or eat bread or nothing at all, 
  well that 's because the scotish originaly came from irland , i think, 
  3.5 humans and half a cat half a dog i 'd say, 
  what ? 
  estonia, 
  only one occasion , a letter about some shootings during wwii . 
  we learnt a bit about other european countries in geography tho . 
  19 german, 
  who said something about healthy ? 
  i do n't even count bavarians as german speaking is the / s really necessary ? 
  yeah everyone knows vilnius is in estonia, 
  well there are some germanspeakers in namibia i believe but that 's about it . 
  i do n't consider texasgermans as german speaking, 
  well if you like wwii and castles you should visit a `` ns-ordensburg '' basically nazi-hogwarts , or quedlingburg where himmler tried to build a nazi-pseudoreligion , also the city is beautifull and the harz-nationalpark is nearby, 
  you want to be burned again ? 
  he mostly makes `` romantic comedies '' and such , also he promotes his daughter all the time and she has even less acting skills than him, 
  anything with till schweiger or mathias schweigh\u00f6fer, 
  no not really , everyone has his own preferences . 
  but if somebody says '' i would never date ( a black person / muslim , white guy ) because they are disgusting '' than this person is just a prick, 
  eventhough baw\u00fc green is rather black ... 
  yeah but the whole political touch is far more recent, 
  we also have that right thing and in addition link ( s ) ( left ) means mean, 
  yeah but i meant that some people have the order of europe , country , region or europe , region , country rather than country , europe , region ... 
  it is so because some people identify more with europe than with for example hungary or iceland, 
  not the prettiest or biggest , but i like to visit them because they are not too far away [ schloss berlepsch ] ( http://www.motion-concept.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img_5310-retuschiert.jpg ) and the ruins of [ hardenberg castle ] ( http://file1.npage.de/002963/11/bilder/burg_hardenberg_1.jpg ) which also has quite a famous destillery, 
  but it 's also skyrocketing in european skyrocketing , am i right ? 
  saarland belongs to france , please take it and give us some nice sunny island, 
  does n't scotland have like three national anthems ? 
   it will finally shut them up about being the largest city but not capital i 'd move it to some 20somewhat inhabitants village just to piss them off, 
  [ bitte ] ( https://www.thoughtco.com/many-meanings-of-bitte-1445193 ) means please , but it also can mean `` please ? '', 
  in the sense of `` i did not understand you '' , or `` i hope i misunderstood you '', 
  [ i feel you ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-m8t6fyfog6k/uzoxiytj6hi/aaaaaaaabim/_swuhdfas7c/s1600/tumblr_m0nmeszmws1qibz0jo1_r1_1280.png ), 
  austria was germanized from the late 8th century onward , and granted that you have your own culture you still speak german ( eventhough a really weird german ) . 
  yeah it 's not like their name is on it or something like that, 
  and frog/snail eating, 
   but it 's not like the gestapo is gon na come and take you away in the next two years ftfy, 
  only by boat or plane , not by road, 
  well , yeah kind of, 
  the food is from one overpriced brand and tastes meh, 
  some supermarkets already have a ( really horrible ) mexican corner, 
  ethnic sounds weird , but yeah i guess, 
  i meant both cornershops and bigger `` supermarkets '', 
  well it 's not what i meant , but yeah lidl counts, 
  nah , we travel 4000 years back in time, 
  we do it after every `` vorlesung '', 
  they will not necessary yell at you , just give you the death stare , so will i and many others if you jaywalk infront of children , guys be a vorbild . 
  i like both to be honest , but long foreskin is quite a turn-off, 
  fluent does n't mean knowing all of it but rather coming as close to the status nascendi as possible, 
  both, 
  [ ahem ] ( http://www.reporternuovo.it/files/2014/11/erdogan1.jpg ), 
  no no not car thieves , thieves in generall, 
  imagine the german states as a family , some of these are really hard working and have lots of money , but out of these 5/3 only one brags constantly about it , also he has his own party in the parliament which shits all over the rest of the family , nature , other families and everything that is n't bavarian . 
  also he speaks weird and everyone thinks if you are german you are him . 
  and he 's constantly threatening `` i 'm going to leave the house if i do n't get my will '', 
  the stories about the troian war and dietrich von bern . 
  discovering our region , visiting castles and museums , or just taking a stroll trough the city . 
  if it warm enough maybe even go swimming . 
  and in the evening either bbqing or sauna , both with friends, 
  i trust them to do n't do really much . 
  also something that you can always trust them in is that the ministers for economy , traffic and agriculture will team up against the minister for enviroment, 
  wee do n't heff an eggcent , i do n't noh phot yoor tolking abaut . 
  ok , thanks, 
  i live in an university town so pretty much everyday btw what does misc mean ? 
  that 's a really weird way to spell k\u00f6nigsberger klopse, 
  i think the wikipedia article said they are somewhat alike but the ingredients differ, 
  eastprussia, 
  do you still have minotaurs ? 
  then your town or village or hole in the ground, 
  we have something called [ amerikaner ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=amerikaner+geb%c3%a4ck&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiu1nwk9efsahvip5okhqwfbpsq_auibigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1091 ) although they are n't really from america, 
  my city g\u00f6ttingen was first mentioned in 953 and made a city in 1300 , the part of the city i live in is even older first mentioned in 915 , with traces reaching as far back as 6000 bc , we have two ancient meeting places ( one in my part of the city , one in another part ) . 
  my city of birth was first mentioned in 794 , the city i grew up in in 791/970 . 
  i mean something like a `` gerichtslinde '', 
  as the duke of wellington said : '' we always have been , we are , and i hope that we always shall be detested in france '' . 
  emperor frederik iii not dying of cancer , he only reigned for 99 days but was pretty liberal , also it would have prevented emperor william ii ascending to the throne at the age of 29 and trying to be the strong man ensuring a good place among the great powers for germany . 
  this may have prevented wwi and germany might be a parlamentarian monarchy . 
  i 'd really have to go with [ hann . 
  m\u00fcnden ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hann._m%c3%bcnden ) ( sorry that it 's in german but the english article has no good pictures ) for my area , for the whole of europe there are so many different yet equaly beautifull cities that i do not dare to give an answer, 
  not twenty yet , but i already moved out . 
  i do n't own a car myself but if i need one , i can use my bf 's . 
  in addition to what the others allready said , it could be helpfull to get a `` point-at-it-book '' with pictures of all kinds of : things , numbers , food and whatever, 
  canada , nz , french or british `` colonies '' or singapur, 
  but there is not pretty much left of it because the inhabitants of my city did n't like the inhabitants of the now incorporated village very much , so they destroyed the palace/castle and only some walls are left, 
  well i 'm learning french and sumerian and esperanto , i 'd say we 're just into languages, 
  work !, 
  my bf just learns it for the fun, 
  r/shitduolingosays duo is love duo is life, 
  i honestly do n't know , the spd wanted to bring through equal marriage together with the opposition , but now they told us it will come after the election and that 's just a let down , so i honestly do n't know . 
  i live very close to the ruins of a early hre-palace where a holy roman emperor died , i know that is pretty petty but that 's the best i got . 
  also [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rgdbh1adg0 ) is a great song by someone who was imprisoned there . 
  turkey , the balkans , russia ... 
  everybody who goes to a gymnasium learns two languages besides german , english and either french/latin/greek / spanish or russian, 
  they are almost as bad as fcb, 
  there many heroes we do not know much about , who saved lifes and sabotaged the regime during the ns-time , sure there are memorials for all of them but most remain unknown to the most, 
  seems about right , f\u00e4lisch is as u/0xkaishakunin pointed out referring to a region in sweden,
