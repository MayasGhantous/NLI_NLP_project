  i meant the top-league ( bundesliga ) . 
  well you either pick one from your state , in my case that would have come close to treason because both bundesliga teams from my state have a deep rivalry with my home town team . 
  if you do n't choose the one from your state you have to decide wether you support bayern or not . 
  ( bayern is the team with the money that buys every good player and makes football less fun ) . 
  then you pick either one of better ones ( for example dortmund ) or one from a city you have some conection with . 
  well some people , like me , even have three clubs : your local team , if they do n't do so well you also have a top league team and the national team . 
  also the most fun thing is to hate the other team ( s ), 
  no it 's schwarzen ( black ) egger ( acre ), 
  well my grandparents named their cat `` pussy '', 
  they are as far right/left as it is acceptable in germany, 
  moderate right ( cdu ) and moderate left ( spd ) make up about 75 % of parliament seats , far left and greens have each ten percent . 
  far right csu is at 5 % ( they only run in one state ) afd polls at 8-10 % bit are n't yet in parliament, 
  cdu and csu are `` christian '' because they are the succesors of the `` zentrumspartei '' which was the political arm of the catholics . 
  nowadays they are as christian ( for which the c stands ) as they are social ( for which the s stands ), 
  the flag i guess ? 
  pretty good actually , but the rather rural areas are a little bit less advanced . 
  also our chancellor has a `` bad feeling '' regarding equal marriage , but we can hope that the left parties will get their asses up . 
  yes, 
  i like san marino 's the best, 
  most people know there is a difference but wo n't know to much about sikhs, 
  the `` es war nicht alles schlecht '' people, 
  my hometown has streets named after it 's twincities : for example ; m\u00f6dlingstra\u00dfe , puteauxpromenade or the haus tower-hamlets . 
  also a europaplatz and ofcourse streets named after famous people from all over the world, 
  schwanzmeise ; long-tailed-tit would roughly translate to cock-tit, 
  * sigh * last year i would have agreed but now ... some people of the new right said things like '' we need to get away from portraing hitler as all evil '' or `` later generations will have a more differentiated view on wwii '', 
  about 10000km ? 
  i do n't think i need to mention a certain austrian and his clique ... 
  besides them emperor william ii who desperatly wanted germany as a colonial empire which lead to the herero-nama genocide and wwi . 
  erich honecker ~ ~ dicktaker ~ ~ dictator of the gdr , but there are still those peole who say `` not everything was bad '' which it certainly was n't but those guys are mostly just apologetic . 
  bismark `` the iron-chancellor '' he unified germany and introduced many good things , but he unified germany through wars and was n't to gentle towards catholics and social democrats . 
  eu is love eu is live, 
  most cities here in germany have former villages incorporated into them , so it goes oldtown / citycentre the rest of the town those former villages then the industrial area then fields and fallow then smaller villages or the next small town, 
  actually i think that nrw fits far better , it has the biggest population , a part of the movie/tv industry is located there , it is traditionally left . 
  `` guy in a fancy house who does n't do to much '', 
  yeah but the parents will find someone who will do it , and it is better if a surgeon does it than if some shady ude with rusty tools, 
  well the biggest concern is that if we outlaw it then someone who i not a doctor will do the circumsision, 
  is n't it also that women ca n't get a life-long prison-sentence while men can ? 
  i 'm 19 at the moment by the time i reach the retirement age it will be at 120-125, 
  depends on what you 'd like to see, 
  it is just so big , there are bigger cities , there are cities with a nice old-town , there are cities with cultural institutions big zoos and whatever you are interested in, 
  i 'd consider the ruhrpott because regardless what you want to see you find it there, 
  * laughs sadly *, 
  [ those scots ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5lyxavka0u ), 
  there are people who know my hometown ? 
  also rott and die frankfurt, 
  they would die to death , probaby, 
  i did not say candidate but party https://neuwal.com/wahlumfragen/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_legislative_election,_2013 and it was either strache or ~ ~ hitl ~ ~ hofer who is in such an organization, 
  [ * ahem * ] ( https://www.facebook.com/kriminelleossisabschieben ) there are some people who want different borders ( those of 1988 ), 
  well a good percentage of austrians voted for a party that has leaders who are in organizations that call austria `` a mistake '' and `` historical lie '', 
  i remember a joke : in a russian history book '' ... became emperor and brought peace and wealth , then ... became emperor and ruined the country , then ... became emperor and brought peace and wealth , then ... became emperor and ruined the country , then ... became emperor and brought peace and wealth , then ... became emperor and ruined the country , then ... '', 
  well it was pretty de-germanized and russia was all like `` muh ice-free port '', 
  a relationship, 
  as `` race '' is n't really a thing , we do n't label relationships between people of different skincolour / religion/background whatever as interracial , yet because many germans have parents or grandparents from all around the world it is pretty common to have a relationship with someone `` of another '' `` race '' '' . 
  ( except maybe for the part of germany that is inhabited by `` friendly natives '' ), 
  this somehow reminds me of a sentence my mother once said : `` that bird looks like a duck , but different '' . 
  they give us money we give them guns and tanks to opress their population, 
  no one in his sane mind would say that he wants germany in the borders of 1871 , eventhough i could imagine a certain party could proclaim : '' we need to think about `` lebensraum im osten '' '' and then go like : `` oh no you misinterpreted us '', 
  well it 's as always , the local brands are the best , and i do n't have really much experience in buying them up here because i get my '' \u00c4bbelwoi '' as a part of my monthly `` carepaket '' from home . 
  i 've seen some cities of germany ( 48 of the 79 biggest cities ) , i did cycling-tours with my dad and sisters along the main-river https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main_ ( river ) , the [ danube ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube ) , the [ rhine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhine ) and some others . 
  also i visited all the 1.000.000 + when i turned 16 . 
  and my boyfriend and i are now discovering our area , doing a trip on each weekend ( or when we both have a day off ) , because of this i got all the local-tour-guide-books ( or whatever ) from our local libary ( yes i know that is kind of a dickmove ) . 
  ofcourse it could have been managed better , and ofcourse ~ ~ all ~ ~ some east-germans have some problems with the constitution , but my comment was meant as a joke . 
  also angela merkel is rather meh , we could have done far better and far worse . 
  anywhere from 0-1817 or 1871 some even only go as far back as 1949 and some even only to 1990 ( when we did the ~ ~ biggest ~ ~ second biggest mistake in our history ), 
  centre-left and centre-right are the two biggest parties and led every goverment so far and every state-goverment exept for three times , the greens last and this term in baw\u00fc and the left leading and all left coalition ( left , spd ( centre left ) and green ) in thuringia . 
  german : rollig - horny ( mostly used for cats ), 
  almost that qould be `` kauf dir ein auto und fahr gegen ` nen baum '' sorry for being german, 
  yes but i remember my sister bringing back a souvenir from spain that said something like `` me cago en la leche '' and this stuck to my head, 
  but still somewhat cute, 
  is n't there also i shit in the milk or something ? 
  yes you 're probably right i just had the spice-islands in mind , and as i already wrote my brains is already sleeping, 
  i do n't think he ment slavs or anything like that just eastern europe, 
  it just sounds so baby like to me , like my 2-year old nephew could say exactly this . 
  i press [ spacebar ] x2 and then enter, 
  in indonesia i think we have it too in germany `` geh dahin wo der pfeffer w\u00e4chst '', 
  no it means exactly that, 
  yes , my brain already went to sleep, 
  this sounds soo cute , maybe because h\u00fcpfen is a nicer / more `` childish '' way to say jump in german and pommi for bomb just kills it, 
  scheren means to shear ( mostly a sheep ) it 's related to schere ( scissor ) so i guess it originally ment cut with a scissor, 
  something like h\u00e4ng dich auf `` hang yourself '' but because we are so efficient every citizen has his own suicideplan with strict instructions so if someone is told to `` go die '' he knows what to do, 
  fb , twitter , planetromeo , google , spotify , maps , weather ... 
  except for the usual ones like the mecklenburgian lakes and the m\u00fcritz-nationalpark and chiemsee starnbergersee and lake constance i actually like the lakes in my are the most , mostly smaller lakes but also [ lots ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/rote-stein-blick1.jpg ) of [ reservoirs ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/okertalsperrepanoost.jpg/1920px-okertalsperrepanoost.jpg ) were built in the [ harzmountains ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/eckertalsperre_brocken_wv_d_schmidt_07_2007.jpg/1920px-eckertalsperre_brocken_wv_d_schmidt_07_2007.jpg ), 
  i 'm gay and drinking cider what more can i do ? 
  the container is called a `` bembel '' it 's made of stoneware ( atleast google translate says so ) and it is the traditional container for cider in hesse , `` abblewoi '' is popular everywhere in southern/middle hesse also you drink you '' \u00c4bbelwoi '' from a [ `` geribbdes '' ] ( http://www.frankfurt-sachsenhausen.de/cms/media/bakery/images/item178/geripptes.jpg ), 
  the state i come from is * the * ciderstate in germany , the other states are either big in whine or beer but hesse is rather known for its [ '' \u00c4bbelwoi '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/apfelwein_geripptes_bembel.jpg/1280px-apfelwein_geripptes_bembel.jpg ) which was brought to us by french protestant refugees, 
  get the heathen * grabs pitchfork *, 
  well it was build with the same motives as neuschwanstein i think , to create a faboulous `` medieval '' castle, 
  that 's somewhere in the harz amirite ? 
  also his brother had the nickname '' the alchemist '', 
  actually the achilles thing was n't a nickname i believe but his official second name . 
  i read , in the book `` preu\u00dfens herrscher ; die welt der hohenzollern '' that names like achilles , cicero , nestor or hector were quite commong among the nobility in the 16th/17th century iirc, 
  well it 's not the one in prussia, 
  that they want to see it, 
  i remember charles the bald and louis the fat , arnulf the evil and frederick the fair, 
  do n't know if that counts but in the part of the town there once was a castle in wich a holy roman emperor ( st.henry ii ) died , wich was destroyed by the inhabitants of the town back in the middle ages now only some walls are left . 
  also swapping austria with nothing/anything would be nice, 
  wait other countries do n't take the dental hygiene of their dogs seriously ? 
   boleslaus i the cruel sounds charming, 
  he was just a double traitor who fucked up some romans, 
  i stumbled across a book about otto the great in our university-libary and i think this sentence sums it up pretty good '' if otto was the source of the river that is germany , charlemange was the glacier it 's ( and other rivers ) water comes from '',
