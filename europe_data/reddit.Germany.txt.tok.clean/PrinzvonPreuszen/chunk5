  you are loosing your allies , you are destroying our planet , you run head-on into a trade war and that strengthens you ? 
  your nation is divided , people all over the world loose all what is left of their respect for america and that 's good for you ? 
  your nation is screaming `` mine , mine , all mine . 
  i am the strongest , i am the best , i ' ll make you pay for everything '' and you think that makes your stand in the world better ? 
  make europe great again !, 
  tea , water and syrup, 
  dunno how it 's called but i had some fantastic french food at a french restaurant in berlin , goat-cheese with some vegetables, 
  border-controles are just so annoying, 
  here in germany we have some pretty decent nps too but i think most people either do n't know or do n't care about them . 
  however there are two in driving distance from my city the [ hainich ] ( http://www.nationalpark-hainich.de/en.html ) and the [ harz-mountains ] ( http://www.nationalpark-harz.de/en/start/ ) also [ this one ] ( https://www.nationalpark-kellerwald-edersee.de/en/home/ ) is not to far ( but has a shitty road connection ) . 
  and our western coast is almost completly covered in [ nationalparks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/karte_nationalparks_deutschland_high.png/800px-karte_nationalparks_deutschland_high.png ), 
  hey , on our last school trip to prague it was already late evening when we were drunk / pissing at ancient stuff, 
  in my region the are mostly `` health-tourist '' in the spas and therms in the harz mountains, 
  i 'd nominate [ hann . 
  m\u00fcnden ] ( http://www.hann.muenden-tourismus.de/uploads/pics/haeuserfront-kirchplatz-mit-radfahrer-c-burkhardt-touristik-naturpark-muenden-e-v-.jpg ) , [ also ] ( http://www.ndr.de/media/hannmuenden122_v-contentgross.jpg ) , [ and ] ( http://www.hann.muenden-tourismus.de/uploads/pics/fachwerkjuwel_hann._muenden_03.jpg ), 
  i have very strong ties with both my current state aswell as my state of birth but it goes europe-germany-hesse/lower saxony, 
  well the states messed the educational-system up without the help of berlin ** cough ** g8 ** cough **, 
  but never combine federalism and the german school-system, 
  there is `` weiberfastnacht '' where women cut of the ties of men and then there is faschingssamstag ( saturday ) rosenmontag ( monday ) and faschingsdienstag ( tuesday ) with parades and costumes and such, 
  we take a ball or something similar lay it on the ground kick it and our dog has to snatch it midflight [ relevant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penalty_kick_ ( association_football ), 
  you can play with ferrets and rats too, 
  let me guess , you own a cat ? 
  we play : * bring the stick/ball * search the treat ( where we 'll hide some treats in the flat while our dog waits in another room ) * hide-and-seek * penalty kick and some more, 
  well at first i 'd get my axe and my knife and his gun , my backpacks , grab dried food , alcohol , first-aid-kit , dog-food , cups , a tent and sleeping bags and ofcourse a survival kit . 
  then we ( my boyfriend our dog and i ) would head east to the harz-mountains , ( less people , clean water , lots of game ) i 'd try to either find a abbandoned house or build our own , but if necessary we could also use a cave . 
  then we 'd start to gather food , try to train our dog to hunt and so on, 
  this fancy salted butter from normandy is so great, 
  the reunification we are paying billions and earned a bunch of nazis, 
  actually only people from munich, 
  we too which i find very strange because hessians/lower saxons are celebrating the marriage of a bavarian king ( or whatever ) from 200 years ago, 
  same here, 
  that was still after napoleon, 
  well , if the judges want to they find a way to , in germany we have the same law ( no crime without a law against it ) but eventhough all they did was legal under gdr-law the wall-guards who shot people were found guilty because the highest court made up the `` radbruchsche formula '' which says that if the law is `` unbearably unjust '' the accused person can still be sentenced ( which is total bullshit because `` unbearebly unst can be interpretated in many ways ), 
  a lttle bit closer to africa but i 'm not good at geology/geography, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niwrganx6q8 ), 
  internet every damn day, 
  except for that it 's a nestle product, 
  they live in south/middle america and the carribean , cuba is `` socialist '' fidel castro and his beard , well that 's probably it, 
  funnily enough i got the idea for this post thinking about linne, 
   slovenia ~ ~ n caves are ~ ~ is awesome and definitly worth a visit ftfy, 
  our proffesors are actualy really casual . 
  i mean they calls us by our last name but that 's as formal as it gets, 
  i just recently switched from coffee to hot milk and regarding rituals 1 . open eyes because of my two alarm-clocks ringing 2 . realising that my boyfriend stole my blanket and my dog `` fell '' on the bed eventhough she 's not allowed up here 3 . angrily stare at the dark/rising sun ( depends on the season ) 4 . 
  put a pot of milk on the stove . 
  stumble into the bath , hitting my toes and shinbone on atleast twenty things 6 . 
  shave and brush teeth and pee . 
  fill some milk into my cup , and some in my bowl of oats 8 . 
  have a second grumpy look out of the window and call my dog for walkies 9 . 
  go walkies ( how can she be so happy so early ? ), 
  make her food 11 . 
  waking up my bf 12 . leaving for work/uni, 
  any citizen, 
  well atleast she is doing her job ... 
  whatsapp and telegram, 
  some of these may vary from state to state, 
  the first that comes to my mind would be gothic cathedrals, 
  the biggest concern is that we 'll get ttip just with the detour through canada, 
  i 'm certainly not on the side of the pitchfork-swingers , actually the idea for this question came to me when i was butchering italian food by mixing `` tortellini '' together with chopped tomatoes and feta-cheese to create absolutely delicious heresy, 
  why ? 
  * imagining people from different countries trying to pronounce `` deutschland '' * nah we 're good, 
  the schulztrain has no brakes !, 
  that 's pretty long we usually do n't do trips longer than 250km each way without an overnight stay, 
  this actually sounds amazing ^ pleasedo n'tkillme, 
  stuffed was ment as `` vollgestopft '' not as `` gef\u00fcllt '', 
  there are certain foods and beverages like pizza and pasta for italy or wine for france , beer for czech republic germany and belgium or choclate and cheese for switzerland , and there are people who like to alter these foods and drinks a bit like putting pineapple on top or cola into it , so i asked what of these abominations you askeuropeans either enjoy or make you want to pick up some torches/pitchforks and kill the heretic, 
  says someone from a country that has stuffed pancakes with the most disgusting fruits ever, 
  probably what i ment, 
  no never , but there are `` army-shops '' and such but they are shady places in some sidealley , also you ca n't just go in there and say i want a gun ... 
  the national parks , and the smaller castles i 'd say there will probably be only local `` tourists '', 
  they are mostly viewed as quite incompetent , while the federal office for the protection of the constitution is quite openly in favor of the far-right and neonazi-movement , with evidences being `` lost '' and so on, 
  klau-sau means stealing sow in german, 
  it says dialects most of them are far to small to be shown individually, 
  thank you , my french is horrible, 
  i understood almost everything , eventhoug i 'm from middle/northern germany, 
  [ also ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_dialects ), 
  as germany consisted of many little states prior to the unification in 1871 there are [ various dialects ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/deutsche_dialekte.png/1280px-deutsche_dialekte.png ) . 
  also certain regions are influenced by neighbouring countries for example in saarland and people say `` i have cold '' instead of `` i am cold '' which they took from the french language '' j'ai froid '', 
  and then back to france take the ship across the chanel visit both islands and take a flight to moldova and then back home, 
  as i 'm alerady planing a half-europe-bicycle-tripthat 's quite easy , we 'd start in southern lower saxony , cross the border to the netherlands and visit some cities ( amersfoort , utrecht ... ) , then we 'll cross the southern border to belgium and somehow have to try to get antwerp and brussels and than back to the coast , then cross to france ( lille , reims , paris ) have a two weekish break in paris , then travel trough the val ` de'loire , at the bay of biskaya we 'll head south throug euskadi travel the northern spanish coast till we reach la coruna , then turn south and visit porto and then lisbon , from there we 'll head to madrid , take a one weekish break , next stops are valencia and then catalonia with barcelona , up next is andora-la-vella then the southern coast of france with monaco , then we 'll hit italy follow the coast of the thyrenian sea to the mouth of the tiber-river , up the tiiber catch rome and the vatican , then take a plane to pantelleria , and after that malta , when we are back we 'll go up the boot again to switzerland then go east to liechtenstein , then austria , we 'll stay a week in vienna , then down agian to verona and the lago di garda ( and somehow catch san marino ) then east towards slovenia visit ljublanja after that we 'll take on the balcans ( somehow ) visit relatives of friends in bosnia , serbia , macedonia ... grecce with thessaloniki and athens then we 'll turn towards istanbul and if they are somewhat less dicktatorrish we 'll have a one - week stay the next country would be bulgaria with sofia etc. . . then romania with bucharest from bucharest we 'll travel to hungary and visit budapest and other cities , next up is slovakia with pressburg and the the czech republic with pilsen and prague from there north trough the gdr into poland ( wrozwawe , warsaw , danzig krakow , not in that order , obviously ) the ukraine and belarus then up the baltics with a larger stay either somewhere in poland or the baltic nations , then to sanktpeterburga from there to finland stay a bit in helsinki , take a ferrie to sweden visit uppsala and stockholm then norway and denmark and then hamurg and finally back to g\u00f6ttingen, 
  it 's actualy not the parliament but the federal-assembly . 
  which consists of the member of the parliament and representants of the states, 
  that 's highly exaggerated they 'll have somewhat around 8-9 percent, 
  also there is `` bibel-tv '' and there are badly syncroniced preaches , of some wacky american evangelist preachers on anixe, 
  also the frankish would exaggerate their battles a bit , like roncevaux , actually just a little raid , made into a huge battle with 100,000 ish bloodthirsty warriors, 
  somewhere up yggdrasil, 
  my opinion is : you have to face this . 
  some years ago people said `` neger '' to black peole but most did n't even mean to be offensive . 
  also do these people want that latter generations think : everything was perfect everywhere and all the time ? 
  there were huge struggles to achieve equality and if we do not teach that sometimes you have to under go struggle to achieve something good , no one will struggle to achieve a better world, 
  this is bullshit , you have to take on history , try to understand it in the context of the time and even more so if it is painfull , because if you close your eyes regarding the past you will also close your eyes towards future evil, 
  the treasure of priamos might be the most prominent one taken from us , by the russians of course . 
  also there was the case of the amberroom , which was gifted to the russian emperor , but originaly was a part of some berlin castles , which the wehrmacht took from peterh ( / g ) of castle to k\u00f6nigsberg and from then the traces are lost . 
  also the only everfound bones of an aegyptosaurus were destroyed during a bombardement of munich . 
  also the princesses-wedding-crown was `` lost '' in wwii, 
  but luther played a huge role for the german language as we know it today, 
  nah , most of them are n't really well known or were even that great . 
  schiller and goethe should be there also leibniz , beethoven , maybe aswell charlemange and otto i. as the founders of germany , immanuel kant , some dudes from the resistance , bismarck as the unifier , carl benz , lise meitner , the brothers grimm , gau\u00df , martin luther , gutenberg , robert koch and many more, 
  well most kurds i know are from turkish-kurdistan , i just said how i and the people around me feel about kurds in general, 
  being aware of our own history and to be able to accept the guilt of our forfathers, 
  erdogan is a huge dick to you and kurdistan should be a thing , also you guys kick daeshs ass , that 's atleast the opinion of the people around me,
