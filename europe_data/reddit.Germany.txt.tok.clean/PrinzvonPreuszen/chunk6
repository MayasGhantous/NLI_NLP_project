  that 's ^ just ^ what\u00ee ^ do ^ i 'll ^ see ^ myself ^ out, 
  geez i 'm not even from lowersaxony , i just moved there a year ago, 
  `` sturmfest und erdverwachsen , heil herzog widukinds stamm '' is the only part i know . 
  except for the fact that would be unconstitutional , it is laughable to ban a certain group , even more so a certain group of believers . 
  what about the following scenario : someone from a muslim country , who claims to be christian imigrates to your country , but turns muslim just a week later , would you outlaw converting ? 
  would you ban all people from certain countries ? 
  well in the saarland at the border to france the bordells are doing quite well, 
  i 'd really love to , but there are so many tourists, 
  ofcourse, 
  this is just my personal opinion but i think the state should be the only pimp . 
  anyone should be able to sell his/her body , if above a certain age ofcourse . 
  but they should be kept out of this criminal millieu , i think the state should designate a building where they can work and are protected so they do n't need some shady pimp, 
  oh wow i did n't know that , thank you, 
  the revanchist attitudes of some french politicians had a part in the beginning of wwi, 
  we should just have given it to switzerland or luxembourg , that would maybe even have prevented a world war, 
  it 's about saying fuckoff to winter and using the last of your winterfood before fastingtime beginns, 
  my birth , probably, 
  what about corsica and euskadi ? 
  i do n't think we have any real borderdisputes , eventhough the border with the netherlands is at one point not entirely clear . 
  our borders began to form in the 19th century , before that we were [ that blob east of france ] ( http://www.zonu.com/images/0x0/2009-12-21-11431/holy-roman-empire-1789.png ) the borders were defined as `` from the meuse river to the memel river and from the belt to the river adige [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/maas_memel_etsch_belt.png ) at the first nationalasembly during the 1848 revolution the people who wanted the unification agreed that they wanted the [ kleindeutsche l\u00f6sung ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/deutsches_reich_%281871-1918%29-de.svg/992px-deutsches_reich_%281871-1918%29-de.svg.png ) meaning that austria would be left out , however the forming of a constitutional monarchy failed because the king of prussia frederik-william iv declined the imperial crown stating '' only god can make a king/emperor '' . 
  some years later prussian chancelor otto von bismark took up the unification again , there were three wars fought one against danmark , one against austria-hungary and one against the french empire , in the end germany looked like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/deutsches_reich_%281871-1918%29-de.svg/992px-deutsches_reich_%281871-1918%29-de.svg.png ) and was an empire . 
  after ww i and the [ treaty of versailles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_versailles ) the empire ( now a republic looked like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/karte_des_deutschen_reiches%2c_weimarer_republik-drittes_reich_1919%e2%80%931937.svg/974px-karte_des_deutschen_reiches%2c_weimarer_republik-drittes_reich_1919%e2%80%931937.svg.png ) after wwii germany was split into four [ occupation zones ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/allied_occupation_in_germany_%281945-1949%29.png ) in 1949 west and east germany were formed , in 1957 the saarland joinde westgermany in the [ small reunification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saar_protectorate#referendum_and_the_little_reunification_with_germany ) in 1990 the gdr rejoined the federal-rebublic of germany and so [ todays borders ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/map_of_lands_of_germany_%28area_states_and_city_states%29.svg/300px-map_of_lands_of_germany_%28area_states_and_city_states%29.svg.png ) were formed . 
  in no particular order [ majestic - wax fang ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b6e0mijv5a ) [ eleanor put your boot back on-franz ferdinand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww92bqyl8-g ) [ all along the watchtower - jimi hendrix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlv4_xayyny ) [ le cygne - camile saint-saens-carnival des animaux ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b44-5m4e9ni ), 
  somewhat , they complain about `` linksgr\u00fcnversiffte gutmenschen '' meaning leftist-green-filthy-good-humans , to be honest i do n't know how dense a person has to be to think calling someone a decent human being is an insult . 
  also they throw their shit out there , and when someone brings arguments in against it they cry that they are censored, 
  eventhough i study `` altorientalistik '' the orient in german originally described the far east , i think . 
  mesopotamia the levant and anatolia were simply asia, 
  most people probably do n't know them , the rest thinks they are craycray, 
  neverbefore seen wealth , peace and rights , even for the lower classes . 
  we managed to conquer our past , are a hunge economicpower , integrated well into europe . 
  science is faring well , culture too . 
  1871-1914 and from 1960 's till today, 
  and sheepshaging do n't forget sheepshagging, 
  we generaly need to get more independet , so yes, 
  the whole [ `` ruhrpott '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhr ) did and partially still does coal , and most other industries ( steel ) [ frankfurt and the rhine-main-region ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurt_rhine-main ) are known for banks but also cars ( opel ) and the big airport ( fraport ) [ hamburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburg_metropolitan_region ) is ** the ** port stuttgart has [ cars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuttgart#the_cradle_of_the_automobile ) the rhineland is known for whine production berlin is our capital and as the former mayor said `` poor but sexy '' the saarland was known for [ minig but is now pretty useless ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saarland#economy ), 
  the wolves were there before the sheppards , and if you ca n't protect your sheep dont get sheep . 
  it is really eay to protect them , get an electric fense , get a guard donkey or big dogs and they are safe, 
  i will avoid them , piglets or none , they fucking scare me plus they would probably go after my dog, 
  i think that 's because rabbits are much more common now , but hares were more present two generations ago, 
  was it a monk seal ? 
  they are pretty endangered are n't they ? 
  last time i visited phoenixpark there were quite a few [ exotic animals ] ( http://www.dublinzoo.ie/ ) :p, 
  i just asked because most of the time someone says `` hase '' they mean `` kaninchen '', 
  actual hares or rabits ? 
  yeah they do better but there are already people calling for their heads , like our minister of agriculture, 
  those sound great, 
  the only badger i ever encountered was n't able to attack anyone anymore : / i once had an encounter with a pack ( ? ), 
  of wildboar , i was walkies with a friend and his dog between two fields and they just stomped over the path 5 meters in front of us, 
  well companies are dicks , i seldomly get a reply when i aply for a minijob too, 
  if only man have to serve that 's sexist, 
  if you learn german , try and get a job , accept the constitution and try to integrate why not, 
  kevin , pascal , jeremy , chantal : white trash ( kevin is not a name it 's a diagnosis ) lukas , phillip , maximilian , sophie , lisa-marie : wanna-be-upperclass horst , walter , hans-j\u00fcrgen , marianne , doris : old people ronny , jason , mandy : white trash from the former gdr, 
  most of them are normal , some are really nice people and others dickheads , they are just people . 
  all refugees i 've met on the other hand were really kind and happy to be here . 
  the afd wants that , banning women from voting was several times stated on facebook by mayor-candidates and the likes , shooting people , frauke petry stated that refugees crossing the border while not yet registered should be kept out at any measure and ofcourse the borderguards should shoot , when beatrix von storch was asked if this aplies also for childer and women she said yes . 
  and for the rest just read their their programs, 
  wanting to kill people is protecting your countries future ? 
  wanting to ban women from voting is protecting our countries future ? 
  wanting to make public media obey every word of these fuckwits is protecting our future ? 
  wanting to force jobless people to do slavework is securing germanys future ? 
  modern germans do not feel guilty for the holocaust and other things that we were not able to change but we remeber it , and it is our duty to prevent such things to happen ever again . 
  remembering our past as it was is nothing we need to get over , it is what makes us who we are and we are quite successfull . 
  with the rightwing on the rise i 'd say nonexistant, 
  well there is a diference between a `` volksfest '' and the `` oktoberfest '', 
  no i mixed something up, 
  [ almost every day i cross this river ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/g%c3%b6ttingen_leine_1.jpg ) [ a building of the univerity i attend ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/auditorium_g%c3%b6ttingen.jpg ) [ what i deal with usualy ] ( http://de.colourbox.com/preview/2359947-384970-cuneiform-writing-of-the-ancient-sumerian-or-assyrian-civilization-in-iraq.jpg ), 
  there is the erzgebirge ( ore mountains ) which has quite a few pretty `` conservative '' christians , but i think that 's just an excuse for being ~ ~ saxon ~ ~ xenophobic / neo-nazi dickheads . 
  also bavaria is usualy the more `` pious '' part of germany . 
  in germany maple syrup is sold in every bigger store like edeka or rewe but it 's quite expensive about 5,50 $ i think, 
   that tries to hide the palace of culture i remember a polish joke that goes somewhat like this : '' where in warsaw do you have the best view ? '', 
  `` on top of the palace of culture '' `` why ? '', 
  `` because you do n't see the palace of culture '', 
  also bibliothek in german, 
  and bifshteks/beefstex means beefsteak, 
  my boyfriend is studying russian and he says that in russian butterbrot ( buttered bread in german ) means something like sandwich and your word for hairdresser derives from the german word for wig-maker ( per\u00fcckenmacher ), 
  germans, 
  that guy looks like bendabitch quimbleback, 
  horrible, 
  i think first we should integrate the countries that are part of the union, 
  and the schatten in schattenmorelle does not mean shadow but derives from chateau, 
  there is some freedom in the u.s that you do n't have in that way in europe like the gun laws and in finances and you may express your opinion by showing the hitlersalute , europe has another aproach to freedom like less censorship ( you can say fuck etc. 
  on tv ) , but the main difference is that europe is rather into granting people rights and america is granting people liberties . 
  why does n't this darn thing spring a leak, 
  and that 's a bad thing ? 
  what he wrote is exactly the same as `` irish people on askeurope '' or `` irish people on here '' would have been, 
  a bunch of rich old guys leading the country , because the people did n't want a bunch of rich old guys in charge , sounds like a perfect goverment / s, 
  yes, 
  where , except maybe for japan , would this be acceptable ? 
  i do it from the bottom upwards but that 's rather uncommon, 
  allmost all of them, 
  we all are europeans but he wanted to adress those who are irish, 
  nanna , the first name for the moon/moongod that was ever written down, 
  also everytime austria does something bad we are getting trouble, 
  i started learning french three months ago, 
  well the `` kneipen '' in germany are going down the drain , just sayin, 
  no , no , no !, 
  never give an austrian power over anything !, 
  u wot m8 ? 
  as our people are n't used to it and some rely on the bild and the likes for information this would be shot to our own kneecap, 
  that 's it f * ck being a historian im moving to luxembourg and get a teacher,
