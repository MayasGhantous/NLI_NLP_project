  a scarecrow-army would be a good idea , creating jobs , being less dependent , etc. . . but we must not become usa # 2, 
  eventhough i mostly agree with you sometimes flying is just necessary : last year my boyfriend and i had a trip to vienna , the train would have costed 200 somewhat $ each for one ride and it would have taken almost a day , car 800km plus toll , bus 27 hours ... the flight was really cheap and fast, 
  well that 's roughly what our teacher told us , the rest of the middle ages was `` leibeigenschaft '' and `` land und stadtkontrast '', 
  we 'll barbarossa 's just sleeping in the kyffh\u00e4user or untersberg, 
  lower-saxony , i like the [ `` sachsenross '' - thing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/coat_of_arms_of_lower_saxony.svg/593px-coat_of_arms_of_lower_saxony.svg.png ) but this version looks so meh, 
  our federal flag is good , but our stateflag could be made more badass, 
  barbarossa is rather know for his inner reforms and his fight against henry the lion of saxony the crusades themself are n't really important to us we spend like two lessons in school on it , it 's a part of the medieval-knight thing, 
  and the [ kreuzspinne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/araneus_diadematus ), 
  well people who do n't drink beer are sometimes kinda looked down to, 
  what about us getting the german part ? 
  well polls show that 82,6 % are actually in favor of legalising gay-marriage, 
  how about sardinia to switzerland , are n't there people who try to make that happen ? 
  [ did somebody say senseless maps ? ], 
  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/hrr_1400.png/1024px-hrr_1400.png ), 
  not just hamburg , bremen and l\u00fcbeck were hanseatic cities, 
  that 's how the still remaining parts of all the hanseatic cities in southern lower saxony, 
  it represents the traditional showing-of-houses of a hanseatic city, 
  it 's hannoversch m\u00fcnden , or hann . 
  in university cities like frankfurt you can take part at experiments and earn somewhat 8-20 $ in one hour, 
  it would more than double their size , also we had to speak dutch which would be fun , and we would get a king and mariuhana, 
  also [ the north-western coast ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/altefaehrhouses.jpg/1920px-altefaehrhouses.jpg ) [ and the far south ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/bregenzerwaldhaus.jpg/1920px-bregenzerwaldhaus.jpg ), 
  very much , i just moved to the northern part of germany where houses of mostly red bricks are quite common while the richer hanseatic cities have beautifull [ timber-frame houses ] ( http://www.regjo.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hann-muenden-reisefuehrer.jpg ) that represent the wealth of the merchants, 
  how dense can someone be ? 
  liechtenstein is a remain of the hre which consisted of many small semi-sovereign countries , but it was not in the focus of the reunification movement in germany because it was between switzerland and and austria and did n't border any other german state luxemburg is kind of a bufferstate between germany france the netherlands and belgium monaco was reestablished in the congress of vienna just to piss of france i think san marino just kept it 's head down and kept out of the focus of the bigger states, 
  just marry someone with an easy name and then get divorced but keep the name, 
  * sweden , i 'd like to experience the midsummer * greece , the temples the islands * estonia , because reasons, 
  because eventhough the usa do some pretty bad shit they are neither agressive against us nor do they invade european countries with the goal of anexing them, 
  literally any kind , we want to experience everything, 
  thank you very much, 
  pretty much everything , history , art , nature , partying ... 
  thanks for the tips, 
  thank you very much for your elaborated review, 
  we 've not yet chosen which roads we 'll take exactly, 
  by bike , if you live in rhineland-palatinate or saarland, 
  my comment was not entirely free of sarcasm : *, 
  pure evil, 
  chinese people at my university tend to be quite rude , but that 's the only thing that comes to my mind, 
  about five, 
  he 's probably an alien, 
  thank you, 
  why do they always have to pick the ugliest tree for the christmasmarket ? 
  which city ? 
  that the city of [ bielefeld ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld_conspiracy ) does n't exist, 
  some people eat rabbits , horses , in switzerland even cats, 
  the free imperial city of frankfurt once wanted to war the neighbouring earldom of ysenburg because they wanted to have a fair in their capital, 
  cash or debit, 
  alexander iii you mean , i wo n't call someone smaller than me `` the great '', 
  mazedonien to differ from ancient makedonien, 
  the universitys of heidelberg and g\u00f6ttingen are the most prestigious of germany , and heidelberg university has one of the highest number of nobel laureates related to it, 
  i would also like to see the emperor/king retire ... 
  danmark : a really good place for hollydays , also i like your queen . 
  netherlands : you 're a cute and weird version of us belgium : you represent europe , and i like your chocolate , your horsepiss not so much luxembourg : that you still exist is just ... cute france : you are our best friend have beautifull landscapes and buildings , i like your cuisine very much , and thanks for hugo , diderot and many other great authors swizerland : you are just going your own way while still beeing peacefull and rich . 
  austria : i 'll just skip you bavaria : you 're our weird and embarassing sister but we still love you czech republic : you have beautyfull architecture , and are mostly atheistic poland : i like your architecture , nature and cuisine , also everything is so cheap, 
  dietrich of bern could breath fire and beat siegfrieds ass ... just sayin ', 
  well i just went the literal way , but if you go by deeds performed i would go with dietrich siegfried and the likes, 
  hermann or mannfred i 'd guess, 
  west : cliffs of moher 52 \u00b0 56 \u2032 10 \u2033 n 9 \u00b0 28 \u2032 15 \u2033 w south : rome 41 \u00b0 53 \u2032 0 \u2033 n 12 \u00b0 29 \u2032 0 \u2033 e north : list 55 \u00b0 1 \u2032 7 \u2033 n 8 \u00b0 25 \u2032 56 \u2033 e east : probably vienna 48 \u00b0 12 \u2032 29.99 \u2033 n 16 \u00b0 22 \u2032 23.03 \u2033 e, 
  that some buttfaces got something to scream about , and arson commited by said woodbrains, 
  it 's rather a slogan but g\u00f6ttinge , a city mostly known for it 's university calls itself `` die stadt , die wissen schafft '' which translates to the city that produces knowledge or the city of science . 
  only when it comes to food, 
  germany, 
  http://www.museumsuferfest.de/2016/ in frankfurt ( and offenbach ( the smaller neighbouring city ) ) we have two museumfestivals the night of the museums , and the museumshorefestival, 
  today, 
  will there also be coin with king philipp vi on it or only john-carl ii ? 
  am i the only one favouring the idea of making the nation-specific , like having the great people from each country on your bills . 
  i think this would be a great way to learn about the other memberstates, 
  i 'm a simple exil-hesse , i see pictures of hesse i upvote, 
  well my boyfriend works for the police and their hot topic is still eastern-european crime rather than refugees ( except for these nazi-arsonists ofcourse ), 
  ofcourse, 
  well he said great country, 
  nice try vladimir, 
  the islandschools on the frisian islands teach some platt as far as i know, 
  probably poland or france , italy is too arogant, 
  disrespect someones car , or garden or dog . 
  are pets familymembers ? 
  how well are they respected ? 
  can humans treat them as they want to ? 
  what laws protect animals ?

  yesterday we went hiking , and discovered lynx traces , which was very exiting for me , because i , like most of you ( i asume ) , am from the city and lynxes are quite rare in germany , so i wanted to ask you to tell me about your wildlife encounters . 
  i 'd be happy about anything more uncommon than a blackbird or hedgehog . 
  do people in your region/country celebrate carnival ? 
  how do they do it if they do it ? 
  is there a food you make in a way that would probably cause the people from the country where it comes from or where it has the biggest cultural meaning to hunt you down with torches and pitchforks ? 
  what is it ? 
  what food from your country area is sometimes `` raped '' in other parts of the world ? 
  please name as many ( one per country ) as you can , not from your own tho, 
  i was just wondering if there are diferences across europe ( and the us ), 
  are there any in your country ? 
  how well are they known ? 
  what is special about them ? 
  if every country had it 's own eurobills , with a famous person ( several famous persons ) on one side and a national symbol or a landmark on the other , who and what should it be ? 
  also just pretend your country would use the euro if it does n't ( and let 's just pretend the 500 $ still exists ), 
  how old are the oldest traces of settlement ? 
  and as a bonusquestion ; does your city have an ancient meeting place/tree ? 
  edit : i mean the first time mentioned , and when the city was `` made '' a city, 
  what kind of foreign market is it ? 
  ( for example : chinese , indian , russian , turkish ) , do you only get some specific items there and the rest in the `` normal '' supermarket ? 
  and what kind of food can you get there that you do n't get anywhere else ?
