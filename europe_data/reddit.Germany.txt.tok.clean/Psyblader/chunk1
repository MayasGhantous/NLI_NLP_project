interesting !, 
  if you pay for one , only a slightly worse connection . 
  if you use free ones , * you * are the product . 
  so like he said , not without a cost , but you can decide what cost it is . 
  because there 's money for that . 
  okay in school and similar places where your surname is public this is a different story . 
  i only refer to strangers on the street . 
  not until you tell someone . 
  strangers on the street usually do n't know your surname . 
  do you look polish ? 
  can you even look polish ? 
  do n't you just look caucasian like most of europe ? 
  i supposed you speak perfect english ? 
  then the racists just do n't know you 're polish . 
  i look a little bit like a turk ( might have had a turkish relative a few generations ago ) and because of that random turkish grandpas on the street start talking turkish to me but i ca n't understand them . 
  it 's weird . 
  but it also saved me from getting beaten up by groups of foreign teenagers , as they think i 'm one of them . 
  as long as you do n't walk around in beijing then smoking is definitely worse . 
  but many people do n't care for their health . 
  they eat unhealthy food , do n't do sport , take other drugs etc. 
  the only problem is passive smoking , but the laws nowadays reduce that by a lot . 
  if you do n't smoke where i am then smoking is 100 % your thing and i should n't care . 
  ( unless i 'm a friend noticing your extremely declining lung health ( coughing all the time ) . ), 
  it 's about the symbolism of the hakenkreuz and not the threat of skinheads . 
  of course it does help because those neo-nazis would otherwise walk around with swastika-fashion . 
  it 's not weird if you know light travels way faster than sound . 
  nobody will arrest you just because you denied the holocaust in public a few times . 
  but if you actively protest against it in public you will face consequences . 
  denying the holocaust is illegal in germany ( for obvious reasons ) . 
  and you sound like little bitch who ca n't take a joke . 
  in case of a collapse , yes , like the syrian refugees . 
  okay , not visas but asylum . 
  danke , i forgot it . 
  they are free to join us on the continent !, 
  of course , because it 's totally not the uk demanding everything they feel entitled for . 
  fuck , i should have sticked with my architect plan . 
  just imagine all the houses that would practically be mine . 
  and because the us military has rockets , jets and tanks . 
  yes , because i did n't respond to the brexit vote directly , but to a specific comment about democracy itself . 
  is it ** so ** hard to understand or are you just a lame troll ? 
  it 's not pathetic as an immigrant who is still learning the language . 
  sadly he has to leave now . 
  oh really ? 
  you blew my mind . 
  / s two possible outcomes will always result in an absolute majority . 
  but he was talking about democracy in general , which ** is ** flawed . 
  which is pretty usual in a multi-party-system . 
  what 's your point ? 
  we 're not talking about absolute majority . 
  you know hitler was voted democratically ? 
  it 's not only black and white . 
  i thought that would be logical and needed no explanation , but some people are special . 
  funny thing is , he started to lie in his response while saying `` stop lying '' . 
  2/3 voted for remain , not leave . 
  are n't you one of the immigrants who will be kicked out of uk now ? 
  i mean just look at your spelling . 
  ca n't be native . 
  and you just accept that ? 
  dk country sounds great . 
  yeah , there is absolutely no reason for a new vote . 
  * facepalm * afraid that great britain wo n't be great anymore soon ? 
  whole scotland voted for remain . 
  so they did win and do n't want to be dragged into uks shithole because they want to do their own thing . 
  true !, 
  the gun was n't loaded when killed . 
  no innocent got hurt except by police tear gas . 
  also , your statistic only includes the states of usa . 
  compare the homicide rate of the usa to northern european countries and you will see what everybody means . 
  i downvoted you for wannabe facts . 
  that just means france can keep it secret . 
  this is ** for ** the scottish and not ** against ** the uk , but whatever . 
  some would say that the brexit is a legitimate reason for a new referendum . 
  just saying ... 
  that 's why they are all single . 
  funny how the snow just stopped infront of cologne . 
  we just got 1 day of snow this winter . 
  we are not dependent in a military aspect . 
  it 's mostly just the citizens and companies who are dependent on their cheap electronics and other stuff . 
  most of china 's wealth is just on paper , debts from other countries which could be deleted instantly , making them lose trillions and crumble down . 
  also their military is pretty bad for invading , they ca n't really transport all their troops efficiently . 
  they could defend invasions , but they could n't invade the usa successfully . 
  they would side with another power . 
  edit : of course i 'm talking about war power and not economical power . 
  that 's what taking over the world means for me . 
  they are way too dependent on the west to take over the world . 
  i had way worse experiences with people from your country than with refugees . 
  natural selection ? 
  you really do n't know what that means . 
  it would be more like a technological selection but 99,999 % of the population never did anything important for our technological progress . 
  they are just reaping the fruits of a few people 's work because they were born in the right place at the right time and yet they believe they 're worth more because of that and even go so far and call it natural selection ... that 's just sad . 
  edit : also stop editing comments without stating what you edited . 
  that way your comments lose any credibility in a discussion , especially if you edit them after you get answers . 
  basic reddit etiquette . 
  oh do n't worry , the homeless people here in germany are already taken care of with taxes i pay . 
  and yes , i 'm willing to sacrifice some personal security to save other people from wars as far as possible . 
  i 'm not a pussy unlike most people nowadays . 
  driving carelessly on the street but fearing for their life when they see a bearded arabian in the train . 
  it 's sad that you disagree with basic human rights yet you feel entitled to them . 
  you are brainwashed if you think european lives are more worth than others . 
  so you do n't vote because your vote does n't matter according to your logic ?
