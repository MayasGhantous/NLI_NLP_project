  it 's just not of big importance for people , so they wo n't vote for parties that are pro gay-marriage . 
  in other words , they do n't care enough to stop voting for the cdu/csu . 
  eh , you hear about the often enough here since they own rtl and randomhouse , which make the news often enough . 
  not sure if either of those are big in hungary though . 
  [ leberk\u00e4se ] ( http://cdn.rezepte100.de/v/de/7/7b834a187072c982731f63b9da2a620d.jpg ) with fried eggs and mashed potatoes . 
  obviously , the best drink from germany is beer in all of different forms . 
  you 've never heard of bertelsmann ? 
  it 's the biggest media company in europe . 
  their foundation is pretty legit , i 'd say , though they 're pro immigration . 
  oh well , you 'll get used to it . 
  back in the days we were too . 
  for mercedes , it 's albania for sure . 
  yeah , i 'm aware of that . 
  i was just making a joke . 
  alright , i 'll tell vw to buy dacia . 
  good for romania . 
  now , buy german cars plx . 
  apparently they do n't play boardsgames either ? 
  why do they even have speedlimits in austria ? 
  is this their one thing to make the world believe they 're not germans ? 
  shh , shut up . 
  if you say nothing you get some of our reddit gold . 
  we all know how much you love gold , schweizer . 
  so you 've basically got the same information as me ? 
  nice . 
  on what facts do you base your observation ? 
  and why does it have to be non-european ? 
  the cultural differences within europe are big enough ... edit : thanks for the downvotes ? 
  i 'd love to know why , though . 
  i think western europe means the pre-1990 definition in this case . 
  bavaria , although they 're weird . 
  yeah , i think you 're right . 
  although , wikipedia ( i know , i know ) states 92 % have german citizenship . 
  nope . 
  the data is there , we just had a census . 
  what 's up with the number for germany ? 
  the census of 2011 states that 20 % of our population has a foreign background . 
  edit : [ source . 
  ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/methoden/zensus_/aktuellmigrationshintergrund.html ), 
  wait , it is n't ? 
  i mean , it only makes sense . 
  they got ta put their billions of citizens somewhere . 
  yep , same . 
  the only bad thing about it is you 're not very informed about upcoming events unless somebody bothers to tell you . 
  the bundeswehr and the french military , presumably ? 
  conscription is abolished since 2011 ... 
  and someone with a bavaria flair would be counted as german ? 
  i 'm not from the german wine region , but i 'm pretty sure someone from there would break your face for these blasphemic words . 
  yeah , but even more turks , so i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  germany is n't an interesting place ?!, 
  not sure where you took this number from . 
  in 2013 , more than 120.000 asylum seekers were registered in germany , while sweden took almost [ 60.000 . 
  ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/375/media/images/77922000/gif/_77922431_where_they_go_eu_20140916_624.gif ) so it 's not even 50 % . 
  anyway , it 's awesome of sweden they 're leading in per capita , but there 's only so much a country can do until people go mad and start to burn asylum homes as it is already the case in germany . 
  per capita sweden , in absolute numbers germany , yes . 
  yeah , i found one conflicting image too . 
  but most states seem to do eu-germany-state . 
  so maybe it 's just the state that decides how it 's done ? 
  also , is n't this the flag of ukraine in your picture ? 
  anyway , no , l\u00e4nder are less important than the bund . 
  especially since most l\u00e4nder are just artifical constructions . 
  there 's more of an regional identification , like , you 're from swabia , which is not a state but a region . 
  then you call yourself a swabian , not a baden-w\u00fcrttemberger . 
  yes , i think that 's the way it is . 
  a [ quick google image search ] ( https://stm.baden-wuerttemberg.de/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_beflaggung_neues_schloss_700x360_dd002ceb97.jpg ) seems to confirm this . 
  we 've already had this discussion on this sub . 
  i think the conclusion was that all northern european countries would leave the euro and peg their currency to the new deutsche mark . 
  the rest ez would then probably collapse . 
  i ca n't even imagine greek can afford such useless manoeuvres at the moment . 
  you got ta look at the bigger picture : the eu gave eu critics a reason to exist . 
  what would all the nigel farages of the world do without the eu ? 
  government buildings can fly three flags on special occasions instead of two . 
  awesome . 
  eh , i 've just made my abitur this year , the kniefall von warschau was never mentioned in history class . 
  you see , this is why you do n't read comments below yt videos . 
  they 're filled with trolls , racists and huge idiots and reflect reality in no way . 
  i mean , we do n't assume it either that putin is a literal god in russia only because some russian trolls worship him , right ? 
  venice . 
  it 's just one giant tourist trap . 
  it 's hot , loud , overcrowded , expensive and it sucks to get there . 
  would definitely no recommend . 
  why are our men healthier than the eu average but our women are ( a tiny bit ) worse ? 
  yes , i know . 
  but they 're saying it 's the unemployement rate and not the underemployement rate . 
  i 'd prefer an unbiased source over die linke for that number though . 
  yeah , it is . 
  the eurostat data for germany states the unemployement rate at below 5 % , so it 's obviously not the same colour . 
  edit : [ the exact numbers . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d7/unemployment_rates%2c_seasonally_adjusted%2c_may_2015.png ), 
  wait , this is what he was talking about ? 
  how are these jobs not supposed to be real ones ? 
  well , no . 
  this is the eurostat data . 
  you need to check the government issued unemployement rate of austria , czech republic and the netherlands if you want to compare them . 
  according to the bundesagentur f\u00fcr arbeit the unemployement rate is at 6.2 % ( source : http://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/ ) , so maybe this is the number you 're looking for . 
  eh , try driving on inner city or rural roads . 
  potholes and barely patched-up potholes everywhere . 
  germany won the bbcs most popular country poll two years in a row , even though the crisis in europe was already ongoing . 
  i 'm pretty sure our dear leaders do n't have to be concerned about germany 's image right now . 
  we 're talking about neo-nazis here , are n't we ?
