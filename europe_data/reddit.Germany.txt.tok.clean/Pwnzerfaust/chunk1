the un counterattack against the north koreans in 1950 was pretty damn successful . 
  what about these tests make you uncomfortable ? 
  it 's interesting to learn . 
  strongly disagree . 
  a person should have the freedom to yodel on his own front yard , as long as it 's not disturbing sleeping hours . 
  who do they think these sanctions are punishing ? 
  it 's shameful . 
  war is a crucible of innovation , but it is one we are better off without in the modern day . 
  technological and scientific innovation requires ever growing resources , and a europe united can pool those resources far better than a europe divided . 
  neither saudi arabia nor the united states have invaded the other 's territory with their own soldiers , as the russians have done to ukraine . 
  honestly , i would love for russia to get a sane government , and then join the eu . 
  think of what we could accomplish together , united from lisbon to vladivostok . 
  infamy limit must be through the floor . 
  guess that happens when you 've got a 0/0/0 skill regency council . 
  the missile shield was a destabilizing influence . 
  it also required the us to unilaterally withdraw from a landmark arms control treaty . 
  swamp germans !, 
  isolationism is a bad long term policy . 
  hope they got him . 
  well sure , but in the event of an attack , it 's much easier to justify intervention to the public if your own people are attacked , rather than someone else 's . 
  why do you think the americans sent 200 troops to the baltic states ? 
  they obviously would n't be able to stop a russian invasion . 
  the point is to act as a tripwire . 
  cause there to be dead us citizens , which would make the us public downright eager for revenge . 
  theology is a fairly useless discipline , and the only thing i ever learned from comparative religion classes is that they 're all more or less equally ridiculous . 
  whenever i play europa universalis , i make it my highest priority to reduce france to a fragmented rump state by 1500 ce . 
  why in the world would you willingly convert to such a back-asswards ideology ? 
  i 'm honestly baffled . 
  maybe that 's the plan , to galvanize public support for more direct intervention . 
  in my experience , people in my age group ( early 20s ) are much more likely to think we should be more engaged , even assertive , regionally and globally . 
  compared to older folk anyway . 
  go away schr\u00f6der , no one likes you anymore . 
  russia of today is not russia of 1940s , or even of early 1800s . 
  success breeds jealousy . 
  well , there was no semblance of self-determination in the expulsion of germans and seizure of land in that instance . 
  i use the nordrhein-westfalen flag but i do n't support independence from germany ... 
  regional flag does n't automatically mean separatist . 
  the point is to ensure that each member state 's military is credibly able to defend itself and other member states . 
  it 's hard to do that when you 're underfunding your military . 
  it has nothing to do with her being a woman . 
  it has to do with her being a civilian bureaucrat with no military experience . 
  nuclear power is safer than coal , oil , natural gas , biofuel , solar , wind , and hydro power , killing less people than any of these per trillion kwhr . 
  would be cool to do this eu-wide . 
  you 're british and do n't know about gallipoli ? 
  brush up on your history , buddy . 
  until thatcher destroyed their economy , if i understand correctly . 
  not super knowledgeable on uk political history . 
  nuclear does none of those things , sorry . 
  if you 're gon na insist on burying your head in the sand , do it elsewhere so your kind stop driving up our electricity prices because of baseless scaremongering . 
  anti nuclear ignoramuses have damaged the economy and public health more than nuclear power ever did . 
  i hope so . 
  i do n't . 
  my girlfriend 's parents still live in moscow . 
  it would devastate her . 
  i would * love * it if russia became a functional democratic state and joined the eu . 
  we could accomplish so much together . 
  did n't have a horse in this race , but it would have been an interesting time to live in if scotland had gone independent . 
  better luck next time , yes voters . 
  well , nuclear power still kills less people than coal , oil , natural gas , biofuel , solar , wind , and hydro power per trillion kwhr . 
  what if you know the name and address of someone you do n't like who will vote opposite your vote and state their name/address ? 
  how do they protect against this ? 
  we are n't big on patriotic music due to some events last century , but there are some historical ones . 
  most obvious one is [ die wacht am rhein ] ( http://youtu.be/xrk-vheop2a ) . 
  also [ deutschlandlied ] ( http://youtu.be/vhqwlemcbry ) is patriotic if you take it in its entirety , less so in only the official parts . 
  a lot can change in six years . 
  remember that the ussr that could barely beat finland in 1940 ended up defeating germany by 1945 . 
  remember that a germany with a token army in 1934 had conquered poland and france by 1940 . 
  in other news , the sun is expected to rise in the east in the next morning . 
  come home , elsa\u00df-lothringen !, 
  and preu\u00dfen and schlesien and pommern , too . 
  if scotland goes independent , it will have to reapply for membership . 
  there are multiple countries in the eu now that would have a vested interest in vetoing their membership in order to discourage their own separatists from declaring independence . 
  chiefly spain and belgium . 
  considering the bayern party is considered a joke , and gets at most 1 % of the vote , it 's safe to say it wo n't happen any time soon . 
  i 'm okay with this , too . 
  it 's not our fault they do n't play the game as well as we do at the moment . 
  and france always just wanted to keep germany on a leash , and now that is not working out like that , they 're crying foul . 
  well boohoo , the shoe 's on the other foot now , is n't it ? 
  nein , ve arre of already hier . 
  i 'm okay with this . 
  yeah , it 's a shame the ethnic cleansing after wwii was so complete . 
  one of my favorite cities to visit . 
  love the castle . 
  he 's virulently anti-eu ( and anti-german ) , unless he 's had a change of heart recently . 
  oh come now , you 're a * little * german . 
  two for one deal !, 
  everything must go !, 
  they might not be delivered yet . 
  what 's wrong with life prison sentences ? 
  i have nothing to really say about cameron in particular , but i 'd just like to state that i hate it when people act like politicians are n't allowed to change their opinions on things . 
  i swear , icelandic names look made up . 
  awesome language . 
  liar . 
  no such place exists . 
  what are you trying to hide ? 
  i 've heard it both ways . 
  i 'm okay with trolling these sorry excuse for people . 
  i 'd support the use of bullets dipped in pig lard against isis , just to troll them . 
  ** na ** tionalso ** zi ** alistische , not `` zosialismus '' , that is nonsense . 
  it 's not specified if it 's the newest revisions , but if i had to guess , i 'd guess that they send the older type 3 models .
