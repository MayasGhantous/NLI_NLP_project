  still waiting . 
  what have i said that is racist ? 
  or are you speaking from your ass ? 
  cool . 
  so where 'd i say anything racist ? 
  love how people are downvoting without saying anything . 
  basically means you have no leg to stand on . 
  where 'd i say a single racist thing ? 
  at first i read it as `` only 65 ... '' and was very confused . 
  was almost thinking baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , but i like your guess better . 
  the thing is , many or most of those parties are eurosceptic . 
  whereas i 'm more in favor of a european federation . 
  it 's perfectly practical . 
  did they travel through a safe country to reach this location ? 
  if yes , application rejected . 
  done and done . 
  if they traveled through a safe country to get here , it is not justified . 
  the moment you pass through a safe country to another beyond it , you cease to be a refugee . 
   category : comedy, 
  why does the `` what you 'll get if you 're refused asylum '' section say anything except `` a one-way ticket home '' ? 
  never been there , never would go there . 
  but anyone that believes in the death penalty for apostasy is barbaric . 
  period . 
  so , again : why are we letting those barbarians into our continent ? 
  deutschlandlied was written in the 1840s , during the unrest and upheaval leading towards the liberal nationalist march revolutions . 
  at this time , germany was disunited . 
  `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' means to put german unity above the squabbles of the various german states , and to put union of the nation above the pride of the monarchs who wanted disunity . 
  do you even know what `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' means ? 
  why ? 
  why give in like this ? 
  hold the line like alexander 's phalanx . 
  i wonder how the course of the war would have proceeded if the axis had won a decisive victory at stalingrad . 
  if selfish means i 'm more interested in my country 's wellbeing , then i guess i 'm selfish and i do n't even feel bad about it . 
  by 2020 , sweden democrats will be the majority party . 
   like i asked for it , brownshirt . 
  nice personal attack . 
  and not even an accurate one . 
  mine is `` not at all '' . 
  anyone who attempts to mock a central pillar of western civilization with baby-talk is not worth giving a moment 's consideration to . 
  they work however we choose . 
  the situation may have been caused by * some * european countries a century ago , but the people that made that agreement are dead and it is no longer our problem . 
  bipartisan literally means `` two parties '' . 
  there are no refugees in germany , unless their first landing in europe was via the north sea . 
  they are illegal economic migrants and they should be turned from whence they came . 
  there are no refugees in germany , unless their first landing in europe was via the north sea . 
  they are illegal economic migrants . 
  so let 's see . 
  women are the majority by 20 % in a field . 
  men are therefore given higher priority to get in . 
  this is considered bad . 
  men are the majority by 20 % in a field . 
  women are therefore given higher priority to get in . 
  this is considered good . 
  have i got that right ? 
  is death behind them in morocco ? 
   you ca n't just generally reject everybody based on the fact that they 're immigrating illegally . 
  uh , yes you can . 
  ** illegal ** immigration is ** illegal ** . 
  they have no right to enter the country by violating the law . 
   you have to check whether they 're refugees and give them an opportunity to apply for asylum . 
  just turning away everybody at the gates is inhumane and amoral . 
  we have gates for a reason . 
  so i 've read some articles about people complaining that these illegal immigrants are rejected at the border `` without due process '' . 
  this is a sentiment i do not understand . 
  what `` due process '' is really necessary to protect one 's borders ? 
  how can it be bad to keep illegal immigrants out ? 
  i have a feeling if he was merkel 's son , the media would delight in grilling him even more . 
  anything that goes against the pro-immigration dogma is racist to certain persons . 
  so affirmative action is great , unless it helps men ? 
  interesting . 
   you can discuss whether making this megathread is a good idea , but all we ask is that you keep it within this thread . 
  from the first megathread . 
  so stop deleting comments about how the megathread is retarded . 
  i know it was n't you in particular ; this comment is directed to the mod team at large . 
    criminals who are trespassing  til immigration is literally a crime . 
  just like murder . 
  ** illegal ** immigration is illegal . 
  it is , in fact , a crime .

  i 'd donate to the government campaign . 
  i feel they would be entirely justified in shooting to kill those savages that attacked them . 
  assuming they 're armed , anyway . 
  under the iron sky ? 
  ah , true also . 
  misinterpreted your statement , my apologies . 
  oh of course . 
  it 's always the fault of the evil spooky `` dark forces '' . 
  naturlich , but this is a subreddit on which english is the de facto primary language . 
  i use czechia !, 
  i 'm okay with it . 
  china falling apart and having the nations it occupied and annexed break free would be awesome . 
  right now they 're doing the opposite . 
  looking through his comment history it seems he 's on a crusade against anything that strikes his delicate sensibilities as `` racist '' . 
   go fuck yourself .

  the origins of the german flag are n't entirely clear . 
  it came to the fore during the liberal movement of the 1840s , when it was used by the liberals and jacobins opposed to the various german conservative monarchies . 
  its symbolism is murky , but one hypothesis holds that the black and gold represent the austrian empire , which was the predominant german power at the time , with the red representing the liberal revolutions ( red being a symbol of radicalism ) .
