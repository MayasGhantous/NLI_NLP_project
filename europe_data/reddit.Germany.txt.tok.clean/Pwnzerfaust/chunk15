  if he does n't want to learn german , he should go to england . 
  he speaks the language already . 
  maybe i misunderstood , but i recall reading a few times that the smugglers shot at the italian coast guard and threatened them until they gave back the boats ? 
  i do n't understand why they do n't just sink every ship after offloading the migrants . 
  i mean , the smugglers ca n't be making so much money that they can afford to replace their ship after every trip , can they ? 
  destroy enough boats and the migrants stop coming , for lack of boats . 
  because it is * awesome * . 
  the italians should put military-grade deck guns on all their coast guard ships , and then , after offloading the illegal migrants , blow up the boat they came in on , and if the smugglers threaten them , blow them up too . 
  what specifically is bad about `` the way it 's done '' ? 
  how about we sink every single boat that makes the trip , after the refugees are offloaded ? 
  the smugglers ca n't be making so much money that they can afford to replace their boat after every trip , can they ? 
  you should only be able to move here if you are educated , yes . 
  frankly i think the italians should do as the americans do : have military-grade cannons on their coast guard ships . 
  that way , after taking people off the boats , they sink them . 
  every single boat used by the traffickers should be sunk . 
  so just because someone proposes to do as australia did , they come from that subreddit ? 
  interesting assumption . 
  liberty for penguintopia !, 
  do n't delete them for no reason in the first place . 
  it was german for 800 years . 
  sure , we could . 
  do n't forget to mention though that before slavs were even a named thing , germanic tribes lived on the vistula . 
   eastern slavs are terrible managers and leaders . 
  i do n't know if that 's really fair . 
  i think in large part the legacy of the soviet union weighs heavy on you , and on belarus and , yes , even russia as well . 
  the way the soviet system was constructed encouraged gross mismanagement and corruption , and it takes time to break bad habits . 
  i have hope that the eastern slavs will break from the legacy of the ussr before too long . 
  no problem . 
  and for what it 's worth i upvoted your question , do n't know why it was downvoted either . 
  i think them saying `` rejoice '' makes it quite clear . 
  so in your reckoning , it is the fault of the average civilian in east prussia that they were raped and butchered and expelled ? 
  is that what you mean to say ? 
  because that 's fucked . 
  they 're not the same . 
  you 're asking people to feel pity for the defeated population of nazi germany . 
  how many people died and suffered in their war ? 
  how many people were lead to slaughter like cattle in their reich ? 
  it 's a fluke of history that ethnic cleansing was all the soviet union did to the prussians . 
  so because the government did wrong things , it 's okay to mistreat the civilians ? 
  what did the average hausfrau in east prussia do to deserve getting raped repeatedly and then murdered ? 
  what about the kids ? 
  the elderly ? 
  the fact that you diminish their suffering because of what their government did is horrific . 
   and then you dare to criticize the russians for not taking care of kaliningrad . 
  for not rebuilding the pretty german houses and churches . 
  come on . 
  i criticize them for stealing german land , forcing out and killing germans by the millions , * and * yes , for trashing the vibrant history they stole . 
   and if we 're going to cherrypick ; here 's what the russians recently built :     http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/kaliningrad_fishing_village.jpg oh wow , one building . 
  big woop . 
  to compare the russian side of the border to the polish . 
  are you equally flippant about the holocaust ? 
  [ germany used to go much further east , before 11 million germans were ethnically cleansed from those territories after ww2 and poland and russia did their best to eradicate all trace of german habitation . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/former_eastern_territories_of_germany ), 
  aww , why edit it ? 
  now my joke looks weird . 
  oh god those things were op as fuck . 
  cannons for enemy tanks , missiles for air and infantry . 
  stopping them was hard . 
  [ you sure of that ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mark_v_tank ), 
  you were ? 
  that 's a relief !, 
  you know , i 'm okay with this , under the condition that the moroccans use that money to prevent the tide from continuing into europe , either by keeping them in morocco or sending them back . 
  government has no interest in k\u00f6nigsberg or its surrounds anymore . 
  the ethnic cleansing of germans from the area was total . 
  same . 
  horrifies me the history and culture of prussia that was ground out and eradicated and thrown on the trash heap of history . 
  maybe stop nuking whole submissions for no reason whatsoever ? 
  maybe be more ~ transparent ~ as you kept saying you planned to be ? 
  maybe demod / u/theskynet ? 
  and so what ? 
  all such religions are out of date and have no place influencing society in the modern world . 
  skynet is a douchebag . 
  you keep saying you want transparency , and then you go and nuke thread after thread after thread ? 
  wow . 
  such transparency . 
  so the holocaust was n't a genocide ? 
  i dunno , but it 's an african problem so they should be the ones dealing with it . 
   iirc , it 's illegal for eritreans to leave their country as well , so sending them back is not an option . 
  send them to another part of the african union . 
  if they shoot , shoot back . 
  seems to make sense to me . 
  they 'd still provide search in france . 
  this just means they would n't have any offices or facilities in france . 
  i see it in a good light of we are part of that leading clique . 
  not ashamed to admit that . 
  the fact that these illegal immigrants are not rigorously documented and investigated upon entry is alarming . 
  the fact that they do n't even attempt * basic * measures to identify and register them is utterly appalling . 
  i 'm okay with them going there . 
  in fact , i encourage them to leave if these are the beliefs they hold . 
  what i 'm not okay with is them coming back alive . 
  i 'm more likely to criticize him for his opposition to reunification . 
  nah , that makes too much sense . 
  oops , you 're right of course . 
  damn you , homophones !,
