yes that really suprised me when i visited for the first time . 
  not only do the czech speak , but they usually are very fluent for second language speakers . 
  compared to 70 year ago ? 
  compared to 10 years ago ? 
  probably . 
  oh do n't worry people will also critize you for getting a useless degree over here , the difference is that after finishing your `` useless '' degree you normally do n't have more than 1-10k euros in debt . 
  no idea who he is . 
  - any error means that an innocent person dies . 
  ( that alone is already enough . ), 
  - death panelties are more expansive than life in prison . 
  i study at a university and considere myself insanly lucky and thankfull for the german system . 
  i do n't pay fees ( just 300 $ per semester , most of which goes into a ticket that allows me to use all buses and trains in my state ) , on the contrary i get something called baf\u00f6g . 
  baf\u00f6g is a government loan paid out on a monthly basis . 
  when i finish my course of study i will most likely only have to play back half of it . 
  the main idea was to enable everyone no matter the social background to get into higher education , leaving aside the social wish for equallity and fairness there was also a economic consideration behind this . 
  the hope for a on average higher qualified workforce , by allowing every member of society to life up to their full potential . 
  wait , i thought the eu made it mendatory last year . 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  we make sure that the beer stays cold . 
  indeed that is n't a small number . 
  i just never knew it to be that huge of a deal . 
  is it ? 
  i was never aware if that . 
  but macron ca n't leave if the french do n't want to leave . 
  he is not a dictator . 
  [ and they do n't want to leave . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/15/post-brexit-europeans-more-favorable-toward-eu/ ), 
  they certainly are n't all monarchist , but there are so many different sub groups i find it hard to even get an idea what they are all about . 
  yep we have some that go into that direction . 
  they are so called [ `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsb%c3%bcrgerbewegung ) because the belive that the german empire ( kaiserreich ) still exists and that the federal republic has no authority . 
  if you ask me , they are idiots , many of them are not really dangerous but idiots non the less . 
  no criminal convict so yes i could own a gun ( or multiple ones ) , if i would be willing to take some time to do paperwork , training , join a club . 
  question two : never have wished to own a gun , but there have been moments when i was more than happy that noone involved in the situation was armed . 
   speaks german debatable . 
  it 's joke , please do n't freeze my untaxed money !, 
  very personal opinion here ( if people have statistics and facts that proof me wrong please share them ! ) . 
  it feels like after the end of the cold war left wing terrorism decreased in level of violence at least here in germany . 
  i am not sure i would even call rioting terrorism in most cases . 
  after all riots are not to uncommon especially after [ big football ( soccer ) games . ] ( https://youtu.be/4uhnnvsmdxw ) . 
  on the other hand we have a groups like the [ national socialist underground ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground ) that got away with murders , bombings and robberies for years and [ was supported ( or at least ignored ) ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-police-document-says-informants-fuelled-far-right-extremism-a-865461.html ) by people working for the constitutional protection service . 
  i think in that case i 'd rather take some fucking idiots burning cars because they think it is a form of fighting capitalism . 
  maybe i was unclear about the word forgeiner . 
  the german word `` ausl\u00e4nder '' is usually used to decsribe someone living in a country of which he does not hold a passport . 
  that is also how it is used in the article . 
  i simply assumed the word forgeiner would be used the same way . 
  germany has a population of 80 + million . 
  according to `` zeit '' there are more than 10 + million forgeiners living in germany . 
  meeting a forgeiner that speaks german is something that happens daily . 
  i actually live in a ( very ) small neighbourhood ( city district ) where it certainly feels like their are more forgeiners than germans . 
  ( most of them are russian , english ( there is a big barracks nearby and the families of the soldiers live mainly in this one area ) , polish or turkish . ), 
  personally i 'd say [ victoria ] ( https://youtu.be/lv3psldy4qk ) , the trailer is mostly english do n't be fooled . 
  the movie is a full length movie and was shot in a single take . 
  no cuts . 
  brilliant work if you ask me . 
  i also liked : [ knocking on heavens door ] ( https://youtu.be/htuu2lwdqlu ) drama-comedy , i am not a big fan of till schweiger but in this movie he was brilliant , the movie itself is really good , never getting to depressiv but still hard hitting on an emotional level . 
  [ generation war ] ( https://youtu.be/tmygpx23px4 ) , ww2 drama produced for tv , really long but worth a watch . 
  [ the lives of others ] ( https://youtu.be/n3_ilop6ihm ) '' . 
  about the east german stasi . 
  yes i hoped i had managed to imply that notion . 
  no new years without [ dinner for one ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/dinner_for_one ) . 
   [ ... ] this comedy sketch went on to become the most frequently repeated tv programme ever . [ ... ], 
  i did meet someone from colombia the other day while she was visiting germany . 
  something she always kept repeating was that the germans drink to mutch beer and are a bit to forceful when it comes to getting other people to join in . 
  but other than that some general stuff that goes for most of germany : - do n't be extremly unpunctual ( a stereotype but a true one , be on time ) - try to avoid crossing red lights , especially if kids are also waiting at one . 
  people will usually not mind if it is just you going over but people may get upset if you cross a red light in front of kids ( because than you teach them bad behaviour ) . 
  - do n't eat d\u00f6ner with a knife and fork ( nothing bad will happen if you do , but do n't ) - at least make an effort to separate trash , some people can be really anal about it - most importantly be open . 
  i have heard often from non germans that germans seem cold at first and to some extend that may be true , but simply approach people and talk to them and you will see that the differences that exist are only in the detail and that germans are like all other people around the globe , some are good , some are bad and the rest is somewhere inbetween . 
  i laughed i had a good time . 
  to be honest i often asked myself how for example someone like dan balan manged to make his music video a hetero ( or gay if you are a woman ) soft porno , but at the same time manged to looked somewhat like a gay stereotype in it himself ( i mean look a him , he is wearing a cropped top and white gloves ) . 
  the video in question : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16n8zhhhins, 
  allright . 
  that is all correct , but the question was not what he actually was , but what is thought about him and i remember pretty clearly that the school books were a lot more positiv about napoleon than for example ludwig xvi . 
  do you mean it was never implemented or never fully implemented ? 
  that was also my understanding ( being german ) . 
  we do n't like him ? 
  that is new to me . 
  the code napoleon always seemed like progress . 
  thanks for the information , that makes sense . 
  i think if i remember correctly that a balistic missle is rather expansive compared to lets say an air raid . 
  everyone who thinks that they can get something out of it . 
  i think the interesting part about the refugee crisis was to everybody got shit on . 
  it did not matter if you took in many refugees or none or were simply the poor fucker faced with either letting these people die or take them in . 
  everyone got shit on , even though it was for different reasons . 
  i am confused . 
  what is this ? 
  what we are at war ? 
  again ? 
  it is not what the supporters want to hear . 
  just as great as building your country under sea level . 
  to add to what / u/baru84 said these events are organised to celebrate the eu and the wish for a united peaceful europe as well as set a sign against populism . 
  what you make of that is pretty mutch up to you . 
  beeing out in the city on a beautiful day having fun with a joke costume ? 
  seems like a good time investment to me . 
  maybe if you are a bit more precise in what you want to know . 
  is anyone else wondering what they had planned with three old pistols ? 
  die they want to dress up as blackbeard before commiting their attack or what ? 
  yes , that is what the article is about . 
  dude , parties we orginized for our school during our last year ( so called abiparties in germany ) had [ glossy flyers ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=abiparty+flyer&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjnmlofi9lsahvecswkhab-bfwq_auibigb&amp;biw=1685&amp;bih=900 ) and professionally designed pamphlets . 
  they are really that easy to make . 
  let someone with a bit of knowladge create a design , go to a copy shop of your choice and have them print a few hundred .
