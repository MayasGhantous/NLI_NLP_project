i think you lost something . 
  here , i give it back to you :  \\ s, 
  and you would rather have an ideologically driven chancellor than one who stands to reason and is able to shift position if she sees she 's in the wrong ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  there is no glory in being wrong . 
  yepp , it 's insanely cool to just buy stuff from all over europe with virtually no extra cost for the individual . 
  what do you expect if you rotate the person in charge every 4 years ? 
   it 's the worst form of government . 
  with the exception of all others . 
  so i would argue it 's a necessary evil . 
  the story of your two agricultural ministers sounds like a tale from a badly written love novel . 
  i would really like to comment and discuss these papers . 
  * but unfortunately they are not fucking public . 
  * thus the talks could be going smoothly for all i know . 
  gabriels announcement could very well be just another political deception . 
  well i have to admit that this article changed my view on juncker . 
  not by much - but nonetheless a tiny bit away from `` potentially eu disruptive '' to `` possibly not completely bad for the eu '', 
  for the uninitiative art . 
  4 of the grundgesetz ( german constitution )  ( 1 ) freedom of faith and of conscience , and freedom to profess a religious or philosophical creed , shall be inviolable . 
    ( 2 ) the undisturbed practice of religion shall be guaranteed . 
    ( 3 ) no person shall be compelled against his conscience to render military service involving the use of arms . 
  details shall be regulated by a federal law . 
  so much yes . 
  the constitution states it very clear in art . 
  4 grundgesetz :  ( 1 ) freedom of faith and of conscience , and freedom to profess a religious or philosophical creed , shall be inviolable . 
    ( 2 ) the undisturbed practice of religion shall be guaranteed . 
    ( 3 ) no person shall be compelled against his conscience to render military service involving the use of arms . 
  details shall be regulated by a federal law . 
  well he really could use one for all the political fallout his recent comments generate . 
  please do n't forget the huge domestic intelligence agency . 
  i really like that line of thought but it is really difficult to identify as a european citizen as long as there is no european national state . 
  `` to prevent terroristic attacks we need to find the needle in the haystack . 
  but the political answer to this problem seems to be : ` hey , let 's add another haystack ! ' '', 
  - ed snowden , but i could be wrong on that . 
  no they can not . 
  each and every government has to abide to the rules previous generations have stated . 
  first and foremost the constitution and a whole bunch of international treaties after that . 
  which i would still count as an antidote ... maybe not the perfect one but the best we 've got . 
  and i thought all those eu regulations were already complicated . 
  except the capital , because you can not raze capitals . 
  exactly . 
  thanks man , and i thoght those federal holiday policies were already fucked up . 
  this is a whole new level . 
  which is exactly how it should be if you want to uphold the european value of the [ seperation of powers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/separation_of_powers ) . 
   a small group of civil society activists has protested the new law as repressive , but russian society in general does not seem to care . 
  unfortunately for most countries , equivalent processes happen all over europe : /, 
  ... because we do censor ourselves ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that this is a nazi joke . 
  which really hurts to admit but is true nonetheless . 
  do you have any proof that this is what actually happened ? 
  holy hell kosovo , i mean a strong opposition is crucial for a good democracy and shit , but this is getting out of hand !, 
   mps released tear gas inside the parliament several times in a protest over an eu-brokered accord with serbia giving more autonomy to serb dominated municipalities . 
  opposition supporters clashed with the police several times during the same period . 
  taken from [ reuters ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn10f2n8 ), 
  asking out of curiosity : why can the eu not just stop providing pensions for the former british eurocrats ? 
  this has to do with the education system in the former gdr where the english education pretty much sucked . 
  which is exactly the age-group of people who rank in the higher ups of those missions . 
  yeah , i guess so . 
  yes it is . 
  pretty much that . 
  a lot of quite old material , partially well over 10 years old . 
  the most recent parts seem to be from leftist demonstrations where a fair amount of police force is required to maintain order , yes . 
  but i honestly have no idea how many people are hurt each year by police intervention and how that relates to other countries . 
  he 's currently quite busy to be honest . 
  [ seems like he has some disagreement with other members of the government ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt2z0nrsq8o ) . 
   regressive left why not the complete left wing in general ? 
  quick , clear explanation . 
  i like it . 
   barring extenuating civil disobedience edge cases i honestly wonder whether there was even one case where this argument was successfully defended in court . 
  i guess you are referring to [ art . 
  20 abs . 
   ( 1 ) the federal republic of germany is a democratic and social federal state . 
   ( 2 ) all state authority is derived from the people . 
  it shall be exercised by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . 
   ( 3 ) the legislature shall be bound by the constitutional order , the executive and the judiciary by law and justice . 
   ( 4 ) all germans shall have the right to resist any person seeking to abolish this constitutional order , if no other remedy is available . 
  makes sense , but i wanted to know where this stereotype came from exactly . 
  thankfully the other commenter reminded me of the crimes of the gestapo . 
  thank you for making me laugh !, 
  why would a german police be terrible ? 
  if i remember correctly we had about 84 bullets shot in 2015 . 
  [ and our crime rate is far from the worst in europe ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/gmaps_rankings_country.jsp ) , too . 
  that 's definitely true !, 
  but maybe we can at one point change our system * unanimously * . 
  a man can dream . 
  yeah , but is it really that rational that france has the last say in this ? 
  i mean literally all of the other member states want the parliament to reside solely in brussels . 
  i think the first step to change this would be that only a 2/3rd majority in the european parliament is needed to change this kind of procedures . 
  this way such things would have long been resolved . 
  exactly , i could n't phrase it better . 
  thanks . 
  considering that the recent `` no means no '' - law passed the parliament ** unanimously ** , i do n't think this makes such a big difference in lawmaking . 
  it was long past time that we closed up to european standards in rape jurisdiction . 
  what this man proposes is a form of collective punishment , which funnily enough is a war crime by the [ fourth geneva convention ] ( https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahukewjgqqqgsznoahxjlmakhwi4aroqfgghmaa&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2ffourth_geneva_convention&amp;usg=afqjcnerl3tgfdebx3gcgvfvc3p_agtliq&amp;sig2=eke__bzb4lshjsfr_jf_yg ) . 
  this makes him more of a terrorist than most of the people he intends to deport . 
  thus he and his family should be deported , right ? 
  hey withmorten , i understand that feelings may get hurt in this debate , but insulting your conversational partner definitely achieves nothing . 
  please calm down . 
  ah , now i get it , thanks . 
  i tried to tie a connection between the 17th us american amendment and the german art .
