  20 - and obviously failed to do so . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  how art . 
  20 abs . 
  4 gg actually relates to the 17th amendmend . 
  who `` we '' is and how and what we do quite often . 
  sounds right !, 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  what do you mean exactly by this ominous `` international law '' ? 
  i still think that the analogy is a really bad one , but thanks for your insight !, 
  i 'd say maybe in essence but not really in interpretation . 
  you ca n't derive the right to bear arms from our constitution which quite literally stands in yours . 
  so this , too is supposed to be used in case of a national emergency is n't it ? 
  elsehow it would n't remain in the constitution by now , would it ? 
  for our non-german-speaking friends here a translation of [ art . 
  20 abs . 
  4 gg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0107 ) :  ( 1 ) the federal republic of germany is a democratic and social federal state . 
   ( 2 ) all state authority is derived from the people . 
  it shall be exercised by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . 
   ( 3 ) the legislature shall be bound by the constitutional order , the executive and the judiciary by law and justice . 
   ** ( 4 ) all germans shall have the right to resist any person seeking to abolish this constitutional order , if no other remedy is available . 
  #i just want to feel good !, 
  even `` impotence '' is exaggerated to be precise . 
  there is a difference between `` lowering or terminating sex-drive by medication '' and `` making a person physically impotent '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm no fan of forceful medication - but the title does n't hold up to the information presented in the article . 
  it 's always nice to hear some good news within europe . 
  and dare one of you to point out this is the cause of some obscure policy which has lots and lots of downsides !, 
  i just want to feel good !, 
  yes , i see that nuclear weapons are not meant to be used . 
  but how does this relate to art . 
  i do n't see art . 
  50 as a `` nuclear option '' where you have to discourage your `` enemy '' from using the same measures by assuring mutual annihilation . 
  so i do n't think your analogy works either . 
  dobby is a nice elf !, 
  true . 
  the production value is extraordinarily high . 
  i know i 'm nitpicking here but it would n't hurt to have english subs to appeal to a broader audience , would it ? 
  espeacially with all the talks about closer international military cooperation or even a european army flying around . 
  sometimes this guy can sound so reasonable . 
  while i like the charts in the article since they provide useful insight into the distribution and historical tendencies of terrorist attacks , i would like to call in [ betteridges ' law of headlines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ) which imho holds true here and states :  any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no . 
  why build something that 's not supposed to be used ? 
  does n't make sense to me . 
  they neither should nor are . 
  what the fuck happened there ? 
  that did n't look at all like this kind of force was necessary . 
  a well-trained police officer should be able to detain a subject without too much hitting him while he is laying on the ground . 
  since they operated way before my time , i was n't aware of the sheer amount of terror those left-wing extremists caused . 
  but thankfully / r/dataisbeautiful had an excellent chart on that topic recently which opened my eyes : [ deaths by terrorist attacks in western europe ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015 ), 
  those are usually facts where i can do nothing but facepalm . 
  wait , that 's not really a fun fact ... 
  those feelings do n't come from nowhere . 
  if they exist this strongly i would like a source on that . 
  i 'm intrested . 
  what ** is ** the worst pis has said in the past in your mind ? 
  why would that be ? 
  whos interest would it be to make poland look bad within the union ? 
  the only candidate that comes to mind would be russia - but that seems quite far-fetched . 
  although they have proven to have those `` comment-factories '' . 
  so maybe it 's not too far-fetched after all . 
  but maybe it 's just a highly divided country between pis and opposition ? 
  would explain the phenomenon all the same without a blown up conspiracy . 
  just sayin ', 
  as long as they do n't have diesel engines they at least do n't rely on spontaneous combustion . 
  has that ever happened before ? 
  i possibly can not fathom a european politician who calls for a modern crusade , sorry . 
  but if you can provide sources that this might have actually happened in the past i 'm very willing to change my mind here . 
  yes . 
  i disagree . 
  the angry man held the gunner about one solid minute in a conversation . 
  during that time the shooter was n't able to shoot anyone else nor derive a plan what to do next . 
  i think there is a misunderstanding here . 
  the germans invited refugees , not terrorists . 
  you make it sound like we purposefully invited terrorists to `` enrich ' our country . 
  which simply is n't true . 
  yes , we invited syrian refugees but no one in germany `` wants '' terrorism . 
  withstanding terrorist attacks might just be a necessary evil to help all the non-violent refugees . 
  well , i 'm 21 and i remember no bombing to really speak of . 
  and i 'm really glad about that . 
  well , i think the self-defence paragraph in germany is n't controversial . 
  there 's just a whole lot of misconceptions flying around which result in controversial discussion . 
  which we have seen on a small scale right here right now . 
  pretty much sums up my knawlege . 
  there are some solid points in there i have n't considered yet . 
  thank you !, 
  `` defence '' and `` attack '' were always interchangeable in military terms , true . 
  thank you for supporting my argument with even better points !, 
  hey , if you want to rant completely in german , here you go :  ich versteh ' nur schei\u00dfe !, 
  ( roughly : '' * i only understand shit * '' ) and for the translation of \u00a7 32 stgb ( self-defense ) , taken from [ here ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0167 ) :  ( 1 ) a person who commits an act in self-defence does not act unlawfully . 
   ( 2 ) self-defence means any defensive action that is necessary to avert an imminent unlawful attack on oneself or another . 
  sounds good to me !, 
  jeah , it would generate a whole lot of new asterisks to the eu treaties . 
  who does n't like them ? 
  ... riiiight . 
  just 60 years ago or something like that . 
  ( a ) even another reason why it would be perfect . 
  having english as the official language would be the easiest move and pisses of every member state the same . 
  if i dislike one thing , it 's when nationalism stands in the way of good old practicability . 
  ( b ) we are talking about a process that would very likely take years and would further some kind of `` super state '' . 
  and if i see russia nowadays i come to the conclusion that they especially do not shirk from war if the enemy is divided .
