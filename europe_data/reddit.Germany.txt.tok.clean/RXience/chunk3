  putin seems to follow a `` divide and conquer '' - approach . 
  ( c ) sorry , i do n't understand your point . 
  ( d ) and a ** fucking nuclear war would have been avoided ** . 
  i do n't see how that could possibly be a bad thing . 
  ( e ) certainly not none , but definitely less . 
  could n't have put it better , thanks . 
  i like your comment , although i think i disagree completely . 
   ( a ) no central language - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_diversity_index - as an example , india 's primary language for the army is english because of the immense diversity in language across the country hence what would be the central language ? 
  english when we 've left the eu and stuck two fingers up to it ? 
  good luck teaching french or german to hundreds of thousands of romanian/bulgarian/greek soldiers . 
  i see no problem in using english as the primary language . 
  as a matter of fact , most europeans speak it , and it would only be practical since it is also arguably easier to learn than french or german . 
  i see absolutely no rational counterargument against english except from a nationalistic perspective . 
   ( b ) this is would be a sign of aggression that russia or china will not like one bit . 
  how comes a restructuration is considered a sign of aggression ? 
  and i have the impression that every military action that is n't disarmament can be considered `` a sign of aggression '' . 
  so whatever . 
   ( c ) it will lead to a decrease in overall european army strength . 
  economies of scale , cutback on defence budget as there is no need for large individual armies when there is one overarching one . 
  not necessarily if you keep or even expand the 2 % gdp thingy . 
  a european army would likely have to be financed and budgeted on a european scale , would n't it ? 
   ( d ) what would happen with france 's nuclear weapons ? 
  if a european army occurred , you can fuck right off if it meant that a nation like italy starts trouble whilst posturing with nukes . 
  nuclear warheads could be put under european supervision with a french right to veto . 
  so effectively no possibility of any warmongering threads of member states . 
  and you could be sure that if the italians posture with nukes the germans and the french would remind the world how the hypothetical european army works and that any italian threat alone would be meaningless . 
   ( e ) why do you need one when you have nato ? 
  i guess because nato is too loose , and a lot of bad blood exists within it . 
  see the current dilemma with turkey for reference . 
  a european army would be more aligned by `` shared values '' , i guess . 
   ( f ) soldiers from estonia dying for french victims of a terrorist attack due to a european general ordering a ground troop strike on is in syria ? 
  logic . 
  i strongly suggest a parliamentary army to accommodate exactly for that fact . 
  yes , maybe it is slower than an army purely lead by generals , but you could add in a law which states `` in emergencies , you can act first and get legitimacy from parliament later '' . 
   ( g ) it would not be in the us ' interest at all to have a european army as it would deeply upset the geopolitical situation + the uk would certainly not want a great big fucking army on its doorstep . 
  are you implying the uk or the us would be scared by a european army ? 
  i highly doubt that , considering the strong international cooperation between the uk and the us with the eu even during and after the brexit . 
  i would even go as far as stating that a bigger and unified european army would be in the interest of both uk and us since it makes for a more reliable military partner . 
   ( h ) if it ever did occur , its defence spending ( presuming taking advantage of economies of scale and cutting it down overall ) would be eclipsed by far by the us ' / china 's / india 's defence spending ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/348164/20140821_dcdc_gst_5_web_secured.pdf - page 94 ) and only slightly larger than russia . 
  so what 's the point here ? 
  `` we should n't do it because we are weak anyway ? 
  so let 's keep staying even weaker by not uniting . '', 
  i do n't get it . 
   ( i ) military complex of europe would collapse . 
  aerospace industry take a huge hit if they want efficiency and homogenisation across the board . 
  want efficiency and want to cut costs ? 
  amazing !, 
  so you want one jet with one engine type to cut costs ? 
  even better ! . 
  let 's give the contract to dassault and make the dassault rafale with its snecma engine the rule across europe . 
  goodbye saab and eurofighter consortium , goodbye rolls-royce because you wo n't be needing them if you are creating a single jet , single engine type et al , only need one r&d department for all that and goodbye millions of jobs across europe if you include cutbacks on the amount of troops , hardware such as tanks and vehicles and shipbuilding industry . 
  first , it 's not that only one jet could accommodate all needs of the military . 
  there is certainly enough room for corporations to fulfil those needs and allow for corporate diversity . 
  and second , if the military complex is heavily redundant and overprices due to ineffectiveness , to begin with , it deserves to be slagged out . 
   ( j ) someone wants to increase defence spending , someone wants to decrease defence spending ... you tell me who dictates what ? 
  france wants to build an aircraft carrier , why should latvia foot the bill for that ? 
  this is a tricky one . 
  of course , the spending should not be dictated by a single nation within the eu but rather by the entire eu parliament . 
  so if the majority of the eu states decide a new carrier is needed , the union pays for it proportionately - and latvia with it . 
  this is how a representative democracy would work . 
  all in all , i tend to believe a closer military cooperation between eu member states would serve the `` european idea '' . 
  which is why i like the concept . 
  . . which til is perfectly legal under `` notwehr '' , \u00a7 32 stgb . 
  so a pro-asylum , anti-terrorism standpoint is impossible in your point of view ? 
  and how do the immigration laws even relate to the general condemnation of acts of terrorism in germany ? 
  you will find no place in germany or elsewhere where people say : `` oh , more violence - what a good thing . '', 
  on the contary . 
  it makes no matter if your felony is egoistically , politically or religiously motivated . 
  if you hurt people you pay for it . 
  it 's as easy as that . 
  so tell me . 
  am i supporting terrorism by accepting refugees from war torn nations ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  \u00c4hm ... no . 
  oh , really ... 
  i think you confuse * law * with * public opinion * . 
  could you elaborate why merkel has no legitimacy in your point of view ? 
  and which legitimacy do you mean ? 
  as a chancellor or as a what you call a `` de facto leader '' ? 
  if it 's the latter which powers does she actually wield to qualify as such ? 
  whell , there is the right-wing afd too with about 10 % share in current polls . 
  me too , i do n't like the program of the conservatives , but merkel has proven herself a capable leader . 
  as long as no black/blue coalition forms , i 'd be okay with that . 
  i 'm still rooting for gysi . 
  better safe than sorry . 
  because ... logic !, 
  so that we have more flippy floppery ? 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  well i would say it depends on wether mrs wagenknecht gets her shit together . 
  if so , there is also the possibility of red red green . 
   cause germany was threatening greece with that . 
  were we ? 
  if that was the case it was an empty threat . 
   also , i have a feeling that after this kerfuffle article 50 will get a bit reworked . 
  possible - but afaik all eu members have to agree to a possible change on the articles . 
  i would puppet first to deal with all the unhappiness . 
  after consulting the [ all-knowing leo.org ] ( http://dict.leo.org/ende/index_en.html#/search=hochdeutsch&amp;searchloc=0&amp;resultorder=basic&amp;multiwordshowsingle=on&amp;pos=0 ) i now know that `` high german '' seems also to be in common use . 
  who would have known ? 
  yes . 
  ( [ as long as you live in rheinland-pfalz at least .
