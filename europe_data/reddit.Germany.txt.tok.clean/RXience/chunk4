  i just wondered if greece is member of the esa . 
  maybe greece can even into space ? 
  edit : [ yes , since 2005 greece can into space ] ( https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://m.esa.int/about_us/business_with_esa/greece_becomes_16th_esa_member_state&amp;ved=0ahukewih7jd_k4doahvldjokhdpacseqfggemae&amp;usg=afqjcneawwjy8wmutdoaihpdeuozhfgaiw&amp;sig2=tdvuc4pmhtwskkvvuw2yoa ), 
  not to mention the ones which are eye openingly genius - like the one on the parliamentary error of the last election , why that is bad and how to fix it . 
  as a german `` high german '' sounds really mystical . 
  like `` high elvish '' or `` high valyrian '' . 
  or maybe i just have never heard the translation of `` hochdeutsch '' . 
  i would have translated it as , dunno , `` regular german '' maybe ? 
  that 's some food for thought m8 ... 
  who said that again ? 
  ... john cena !, 
  but we really liked our v-waffe ... !, 
  : / what luck that our us american friends station their rockets on or soil . 
  that way we can at least watch from afar ... , 
  truth be told : even hitler was more or less democratically elected . 
  interesting , thanks for the explaination !, 
  but to remain off-topic . 
   slightly off-topic : `` democratic '' is a bit overused , we really need something better to encompass the multitude of procedural checks and balances that make a liberal democracy work better than `` mob rule '' . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  care to elaborate ? 
  interesting . 
  i suspected that more than an mp announcement would be necessary - but just under the assumption that this would need to happen in any country that claims herself to be democratic . 
  oh , i think you would need to really stretch art . 
  7 to push out the uk . 
  it was neither designed for that purpose nor does the uk fit the current criteria for other eu member states to even invoke art 7 . 
  for the uninformed :  ** 1 . 
  ** on a reasoned proposal by one third of the member states , by the european parliament or by the european commission , the council , acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 . 
  before making such a determination , the council shall hear the member state in question and may address recommendations to it , acting in accordance with the same procedure . 
  the council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply . 
  ** the european council , acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 , after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  ** where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made , the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the member state in question , including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that member state in the council . 
  in doing so , the council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons . 
  the obligations of the member state in question under the treaties shall in any case continue to be binding on that state . 
  ** the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being imposed . 
  ** the voting arrangements applying to the european parliament , the european council and the council for the purposes of this article are laid down in article 354 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  i do n't see how some inner political shenanigans would qualify as `` the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values [ of the eu ] '' . 
  sorry , even if there would be a way if there were a will - that way would be stupid . 
  there is no legal way to `` push out '' an eu member . 
  no matter if you find that good or bad - it 's what the 28 members have agreed upon . 
  so the uk has to push the `` article 50 button '' herself . 
  but there is a likely scenario that this will * never * happen and the `` brexit '' will go into history as an anecdotal sidenote . 
  especially since the brexit vote was not a legally binding one . 
  interesting video on that topic : [ brext , briefly by cgp grey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3_i2rfapyk ) . 
  this might be true in this particular case . 
  if you want to thank a divine being that the person had no access to a gun , please feel free to do so . 
  but if you take a look at the * likelihood * of these people taking up arms and going on rampage , it becoms apparent that having less lethal weapons to begin with decreases that chance of them getting into the wrong hands . 
  thus we should thank tight weapon legislation . 
  yes . 
  and where should be the difference if all your political tricks are applied consistently in 2006 and in 2016 ? 
  i have zero problem with secular humans immigrating . 
  why should n't they ? 
  this is why i usually love americans !, 
  that much is true , but are they really `` mass importing immigrants '' ? 
  the only country i see doing that is germany . 
  but she can economically take it - she might even * need * something to close her demographic gap . 
  all the other eu states , especially the mediterranean ones , are actively opposing mass immigration - which is their due right . 
  i see no `` mass import of refugees '' from their perspective . 
  i think it 's time for something that at least has somewhat of an effect : economic embargoes . 
  unfortunately i can not see that coming without the us initializing it . 
  that does n't even make sense . 
   the few lucky enough to work , earn the same wages as 2006 . 
  i would like to argue against that statement from two different directions . 
  first would be the effective employment rate from 2006 vs. 2016 . 
  respectively :  the few lucky enough to work while you always have to be careful about who you consider unemployed and who not , as long as the same counting method is applied , you should get more or less comparable data . 
  you can see that unemployment is significantly lower today than it was 2006 . 
  stating anything else is just a false claim . 
  the second part :  [ the germans ] earn the same wages as 2006 . 
  ... is a bit trickier to debunk . 
  data on consumer prices ( verbraucherpreise ) and earnings ( verdienste ) are notoriously hard to track . 
  nonetheless , there are considerable efforts to collect both and even compare them . 
  the value you can derive from that is called real wage index ( reallohnindex ) . 
  [ plotting this index from 2006 to 2015 ] ( http://imgur.com/j0zze7b ) reveals that , in fact , the germans earn not just the same as in 2006 but more than 6 % more . 
  please bear in mind that this number is after consideration of all rises in prices for consumer goods . 
  maybe the next time you can adjust your claims to the factual reality . 
  nothing to thank god for . 
  thank tight weapon legislation instead . 
  gysi for ~ ~ president ~ ~ chancellor !, 
  did n't knew that . 
  interesting . 
  hence the colors . 
  it 's nice . 
  i like it . 
  since we will be the only ones left ? 
  dark . 
  so if i were moscow i would only consider a war if i had either nothing to loose or much to gain . 
  i do n't see what there is to gain . 
  neither do i think that moscow is willing to lose hundred of thousands of lives in basically a war with the nato . 
  i think the implementation of tighter trade agreements and ultimately the eu played a big part in the prevention of war as well . 
  i do n't get it . 
  who are those people ? 
  apparently , i ~ ~ am ~ ~ was stupid . 
  although those gentleman look quite distant , i am very happy about the symbolism .
