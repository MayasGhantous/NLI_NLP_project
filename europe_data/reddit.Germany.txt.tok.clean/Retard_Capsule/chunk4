  which is what ? 
  it 's not the first time german politicians side with athens in the matter . 
  why is it in the headlines now ? 
  why is schwan singled out ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  calling her `` prominent '' seems like bit of a stretch to me . 
  who the fuck is gesine schwan ? 
  forgot to get any viewing equipment beforehand . 
  the sky was clear , but i did n't want to lose my eyesight , so ... yeah . 
  but i saw the eclipse in 1999 , so it 's okay . 
  dealing with court orders and shit costs a lot of time . 
  the opposition could just sue an unwanted politician for the biggest nonsense which would never go through ; as long as it would get to court , said politician would spend his days with judges and lawyers instead of governing . 
  any form of efficient governance would be impossible . 
  the event where the talk was given was called `` subversive festival '' , and ai weiwei is one of the most well-known subversive elements of our days . 
  i would say it is a coincidence . 
   i always felt like polish is pretty universal slavic language ... you can understand every other slav but no one understands you . 
  sounds like it would be very useful language to pick up at some point ^ ^ and ^ ^ it ^ ^ would ^ ^ make ^ ^ things ^ ^ easier ^ ^ when ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ time ^ ^ for ^ ^ the ^ ^ anschluss, 
  well , the middle finger * was * indeed first used by b\u00f6hmermann , that 's how jauch found it in the first place . 
  i was watching the fingerless video as shown earlier in the show , there are no such artefacts there . 
  that was probably a more refined version than the one in the editing scene . 
  ah , yes , in the direct comparison shot , i found the frame . 
  earlier i tried it with the footage shown at the beginning of the show and could n't get such artefacts to show , that was probably the finished version then . 
  mh , i 've just rerun that part of the video twenty times over and ca n't get a frame with two microphone cables . 
  but maybe my spacebar action is just too slow . 
  indeed !, 
  i forgot to mention that . 
  where the heck would that come from ? 
  to everyone pondering the possibility that the finger video is the original , and they faked another version without the finger : that was my first thought as well , but take a look at the timing of things . 
  the full speech where varoufakis supposedly showed the finger was posted [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=meuwxnifjj8#t=2392 ) by the subversive festival ( check the description !, 
  ) , at february 12th 2015 ; almost two years after the speech was given . 
  only two weeks later , the guys running this show showed the music video [ v for varoufakis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afl9wfgje0m ) , with some random actor standing in for varoufakis . 
  but at the very end of the video , when the song is over , they just showed the supposed original middle finger footage for a few seconds . 
  it was the most * perfect * bait for media outlets like bild and g\u00fcnther jauch to pick up . 
  and only two days after jauch confronted varoufakis and the german media went on an all-out assault on varoufakis for showing germany the finger , this short documentary is published by the same guys . 
  it all adds up perfectly . 
  i highly doubt the finger footage is the original . 
  ^ ( * edit for typos and grammar ), 
  english ones are already available . 
  i feel you drowned the joke by doing so . 
  my dry german humour ca n't handle that kind of depth . 
   your collective sense of humour is quite different . 
  case in point , you evidently missed the joke . 
  and a pretty terrible skin condition . 
  while possible , there is a point where it just becomes impractical to make and use ied 's of that size . 
  mobility is key in modern warfare , moving around explosives weighing half a ton is n't exactly advantageous . 
  way to spoil the stereotype . 
   i 'd much rather have this than free movement within the eu . 
  these are all highly developed nations [ ... ] hey !, 
  sure , `` a couple dozen protestors '' fucked up half the inner city and laid fire to cars while an army of policemen could n't stop them . 
  those vandalizers might be a minority , but your estimation is off by at least one order of magnitude . 
  i 've been to various demonstrations in my younger years ( early 2000 's ) , some of them pretty large . 
  never had any trouble with the police , but i 've seen plenty of punks and people of the self-proclaimed `` antifa '' stirring up shit with fireworks and trying to make their way to cars and properties belonging to known politicians , but the police managed to hold them of during these protests ( without teargas , batons or water-throwers ) . 
  just because you see lots of hard crackdowns in germany you should n't automatically blame the police . 
  there are a lot of mental assholes amongst the protesters at absolutely every demonstration i 've been to . 
  they like to make their way to every decently sized demonstration and just start vandalizing . 
  there 's a reason why the police always comes all geared up and outnumbering the protesters , and no , it 's not because we 're a police state . 
  nobody took away their right to protest . 
  they only did n't allow them to demonstrate right in front the ecb , because the authorities feared these people might have lynched everyone in a suit should they have gotten the chance . 
  and i think so , too . 
  just look at this shit . 
  they even threw rocks at firemen trying to get to the burning cars . 
  give the man a break , i doubt they gave him any heads-up to the video , his response might have just have been a defensive outburst . 
  he 's just a human being who can lose his composure like everyone else when pushed in a corner . 
  afaik he has little to no experience as a politican , he is an old economics professor and not ( yet ) used to dealing with this kind of shit . 
   so why is he denying exactly that ? 
  the video is two years old , there 's a good chance he would n't remember a minor hand gesture like a rhetorical finger . 
   it was just a rhetorical gesture in a completely different context , yes , seriously : he does n't make the impression that he even was aware of the camera in that moment . 
  even if this is n't doctored , it looks as if he was just making the gesture sideways to the ground , the way people do it when they rhetorically talk about the finger without actually giving it to anyone . 
  ^ ( * edit : forgot a word ), 
  we still have a fair amount of coal that 's still being dug up , next to some `` minor '' stuff like fluorite . 
  and there 's actually some mineral oil in the ground in some parts of our country , although it 's all in crappy sandy soil that currently makes it too expensive to pump up . 
  but we 're going to tap resource at some point in the future , too . 
  silly , of course putin is going to rappel down from a heli with his newborn child in arm , fireworks going off around the kremlin and the russian army saluting the prince . 
  shut up yurop big yurop stronk :'(, 
  she * actually * said that ? 
  wow , she must have been pissed . 
  maybe he did n't want to be too much of an inconvenience and figured the ceramic tiling in the bakery would be perfect to just hose his guts off when he was done . 
   i 'm a feminist and i converted to islam  i am a muslim , but i was n't always . 
  i converted to islam in november 2001 , two months after 9/11 . 
  how much of a special snowflake drama queen can one person be ? 
  it 's like she 's forcing herself to be as different and ` alternative ' as possible to her peers . 
  i like how they silently agreed to all face the same direction to minimize the risk of accidentally having eye contact or , even worse , a conversation . 
   `` yeah but white men do it too ! '', 
  except they actually do n't , which makes such responses even more ridiculous . 
  this is the first time in recorded history that entire gangs of young men roam german streets with the intent of molesting women . 
  this has literally never happened before . 
  in early january ? 
  in finland ? 
  which is pretty much why i do n't like clubbing very much even though i really love the dancing bit . 
  the only quiet area you can retreat to usually is the rancid smokers ' corner . 
  and small clubs often do n't even have that and you have to * leave * the club to talk to someone , as you said . 
  oh , so it 's that you do n't want to have ** even more ** taxes for the wealthy ** than there already are ** ? 
  sorry , that was n't clear to me from your post . 
  um , is n't this already the way it 's working in most of the developed world ? 
  i know there are often loopholes especially for the rich to avoid some of the taxes , but still . 
  i thought progressive taxes were a widely adopted system by now . 
  i * believe * you could legally make it so that foreign eu citizens would only qualify after living and working in the respective country for a while . 
  afaik you do n't automatically receive the welfare benefits of another country within the eu right after moving there . 
  but even then , there 's the possibility that foreigners would come , work the minimum to qualify and then just put their feet up and live as pensioners from a young age . 
  so foreign eu citizens might still be an issue , even if i am believing correctly .
