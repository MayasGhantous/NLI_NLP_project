  i 'd tend to agree with you , but it 's kind of an unwritten law on most of reddit that sarcasm not marked as such is taken at face value of what was written . 
  as i said , i 'm wondering why people would downvote you . 
  the sarcasm was indeed blatantly obvious to me . 
  you forgot your ** / s ** , right ? 
  i 'm wondering about the downvotes you got , you can hardly be serious . 
   but that is not how islam classes work . 
  er , in public schools we can just ** make ** them work this way , ca n't we ? 
  it 's not entirely uncommon to reschedule exams if enough people ask nicely , is it ? 
  i do n't think i quite see the issue here . 
  should their wishes get turned down automatically for ( anti ) religious reasons ? 
  i must have been living under a rock . 
  when did this happen ? 
  afaik he seems to have networked with at least one neonazi , but as of now it is n't known whether he was one himself . 
  could have just been an exchange with a fellow breivik fan , i guess . 
  i 'm not sure it matters much anyway , his primary motive seems to have been hate on society as a whole , and his mental problems , not to send a political message either way . 
  the elephant in the room is the mass shooting in munich by a probably atheist schizo . 
  off the top of my head i can also remember an explosion in brussels that was actually an accident , and at least one knife attack by a random psycho . 
  it 's hard to find them now , most of these stories do n't stick on the front page for longer then a couple hours when it surfaces that the incident was n't connected to islamism . 
  nonetheless , all of those threads were at first full of `` extremist refugees strike again '' comments . 
  and / r/europe has already been wrong on several accounts this year when immediately assuming something was an islamic terrorist attack . 
  random acts of violence happen in most countries , recently the media are just going crazy whenever more than a single person was hurt somewhere in europe because they want to be the first to report on the latest act of terror . 
  in this instance the perpetrator seems to have tried to commit suicide after the deed btw , this is at least rather unusual for an islamic attack . 
  what do you mean ? 
  there have been worse random explosions , in old buildings full of gas pipes especially . 
  maybe we should just secede and join austria to form an austro-bavarian mini-empire . 
  yes . 
  i just googled the case . 
  if anybody else is as curious as me : both students got a conditional discharge for 21 and 15 months respectively . 
  damn , seems like latvians age really well . 
  the guy looks like he 's 16 . 
  but there have already been several similar arrests this year alone in germany , france , belgium and several other countries ? 
  the comment was about the parents not knowing about it , not about condoning it . 
   everyone needs to have sugar in their ration . 
  well , not really . 
  not refined sugar anyway . 
  it certainly is n't the same thing as taxing drugs , but i can see how the same line of thinking could lead to a sugar tax . 
  smokers and drinkers pay for their socially costly sins through extra taxes , you * could * interpret a sugar tax as doing the same to fatties . 
  maybe even more importantly , european burglars that get disturbed are almost guaranteed to bolt . 
  american burglars that get caught by the inhabitants are rather likely to kill them , to make sure they do n't get shot themselves . 
  burglars rather turn into murderers than die `` on the job '' . 
  have you seen the video i 'm referring to ? 
  the shooter was all alone on a big parking deck , there certainly was n't a conceivable risk of collateral damage . 
  most likely he would have missed and the shooter would have been forced to seek cover at a lower deck or whatever . 
  not sure what good that would do , but it 's just a thought i had anyway . 
   as a proportion of the existing population , yes sweden has far more and they 've been living in the country for longer . 
  that is simply not true , according to the latest official census germany has about 19 % of its population with a migratory background , and most estimates i 've seen about sweden put it somewhere around 20 % . 
  more than germany , yes , but not by much . 
  both countries are in the same league here . 
   sweden has had high immigration for years . 
  you mean as opposed to germany ? 
  so is it an ongoing gang war ? 
  that would explain why it does n't get reported abroad . 
  same in frankfurt , but here we do n't have people chucking grenades around on a monthly basis . 
  the only big thing this year as far as i remember was a shoot-out amongst members of a local biker gang that happened downtown over some internal power struggles ( edit : which evidently was n't migrant-related ) . 
  fair enough . 
  since the post i originally responded to wondered what good a gun at home could possibly do , i was just pondering how in recent cases an armed civilian * might * have possibly been able to defuse a situation . 
  to be honest i 'm probably one of those people who might get armed now if it was n't so bloody difficult here in germany . 
  i 'm fully aware how unlikely it is that it might ever be of any use , i guess it 's an emotional response to the recent terror attacks and rightwing schizos going postal . 
  he was still armed , had ammunition and was potentially dangerous . 
  i do n't see your point of conjuring up a `` what if '' of him being captured alive , when an equally possible `` what if '' could be him engaging in another shoot-out with the police and potentially killing someone instead of shooting himself . 
  he even shot at the balcony guy hurling insults at the shooter , but missed at the distance . 
  * sigh , * time to dig more ~ ~ trenches ~ ~ holes in the beaches . 
  i had n't even noticed they share a border . 
  til . 
  if there 's some shooting nearby it 's reassuring to have a gun at home . 
  it 's very unlikely that terrorists would break and enter random homes after an attack , but it feels good to be prepared for the worst case . 
  also imagine if munich balcony guy had a rifle at home . 
  he could have sent a couple shots towards the gunman on the parking deck . 
   they get sent to a randomised european country . 
  have fun getting that through the parliament in brussels . 
  i 'm sure it 's going to go swimmingly with thunderous applause . 
   the funny thing is they mistakenly given me a screwdriver when i left in the morning . 
  maybe you stole that screwdriver earlier that night and were to drunk to remember . 
  [ `` django as\u00fcl '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/django_as\u00fcl ) is a bavarian comedian of turkish descent speaking in bavarian dialect . 
  and i know more such examples of people i personally know , but they still are by and large the exception . 
   especially as a poor kid it 's actually much easier if you grow up in a rough neighbourhood with lots of foreign immigrants . 
  because that 's exactly where you may find a black market for unregistered firearms . 
  balcony guy speaks in bavarian dialect , that is very rare for people of foreign ethnicity ( although not unheard of ) . 
   oh , and he 's iranian , so most likely a shia muslim . 
  as a second generation to the iranian diaspora that fled the revolution , he was most likely atheist . 
  i have yet to meet a single devout muslim from that population . 
  it 's the motive , not the body count . 
  people randomly shooting others and then killing themselves because of mental issues have happened before , it does n't always take a political or religious motivation for these things to happen . 
  the uk has always been one of the most neoliberal forces * within * the eu though , so unless there 's some major and long-lasting change in the political leadership in westminster after all is said and done , i remain sceptical whether the little man in the uk may be better off outside of the eu . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ edit : ^ ^ ^ ^ fixed ^ ^ ^ ^ typo, 
   if it 's marked and sold as a defense against animals , because for some weird reason that excludes it from being covered by weapons law . 
  yes , therefore it 's legal . 
  you just slap an `` only use against animals '' sticker on it and you 're golden . 
  you can get the stuff at every weapons shop without a license or anything . 
  you can even order it online . 
  and in an emergency situation you 're allowed to use anything at your disposal . 
  so yes , while it 's in that weird limbo state of officially being not really legal to be used in self-defence against humans , in reality it absolutely is . 
  the fact that it counts as a weapon really just means that you are n't allowed to carry it with you at any kind of big gathering , like concerts , mass protests , etc. 
   possession might be illegal though . 
  no it 's not ? 
  pepperspray is perfectly legal . 
  and nobody will fine you for using it against a fucking axe murderer . 
   military stating that a `` peace council '' has taken over . 
  rather orwellian language !, 
  it 's a reference to an [ atat\u00fcrk quote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_at_home,_peace_in_the_world ) .
