   for example they advertise the morning after sos pills on daytime tv i do n't think after-sex pills count as `` abortion '' though , they only stop ovulation in its tracks and do n't work after conception . 
  i hear putin is very docile this time of the year . 
  from little green men going on a vacation to germany , i presume . 
  in german fairy tales it 's just `` and if they have n't died , then they 're still alive today '' . 
  now that i think about it ... ** well duh , mom **, 
  i believe it was the german minister of finance who said yesterday , that spain is indeed the most likely candidate due to the eu 's haggling nature of `` everyone gets their fair share of official institutions '' . 
  insurance and stock regulations are already located in frankfurt and paris respectively . 
   not to mention that the veggie food more often than not is literal shit . 
  i rather doubt that . 
  i believe that 's pretty standard for political meetings for anything above small townships . 
  it 's not like they 'd toss the unopened bottles in the garbage should the seated not feel thirsty . 
  aww , look at nigel blushing !, 
  that 's not true , at least not as such a generalized statement . 
  for example when i was working in the austrian hinterlands i experienced enormous hostility towards all slavic people . 
  but think of all those poor irish mep 's who would suddenly start to receive all their official documents in gaelic . 
   since we 're the only major english speaking country left in the eurozone i 'd have a good chuckle if the maltese coastline got a new skyline out of this . 
  i thought cameron said there should be a new pm by october * at the latest * . 
  but that does n't change your overall point . 
   can block things as they want . 
  and you think if there 's a vote on something with 27 nations against only the uk trying to block it on its way out with its veto right everyone is just going to shrug their shoulders and go `` bugger , what a shame , i guess we ca n't do that thing '' ? 
  really ? 
  if everyone else agrees they can most definitely just evict all uk mep 's and councillors , should the uk decide to try and sabotage a union they 're about to leave . 
  i do n't know if that 's * legally possible * , but it definitely would n't be the first time the eu ignores technical legalities if there 's wide and major support for the decision . 
  as things are standing , the uk 's eu politicians are all allowed to stay and finish their terms . 
  but trying to push their force as you suggest wo n't work out in their favour . 
  too late . 
  i just read something about the eu bringing in pakis and allowing them to rape our children . 
  those people are in for a rough awakening ^ ^ i ^ ^ mean ^ ^ the ^ ^ commenters , ^ ^ not ^ ^ the ^ ^ pakis, 
   aka trying to force migrants to nations who do n't want them . 
  only that never happened , it was proposed by some nations and turned down by the rest . 
  as is common in a functioning ** democracy ** . 
  but i can see you ca n't comprehend what that word even means . 
  you 're evidently one of those people whose idea of a * `` democratic '' * eu is `` everyone should just shut up and do what england wants them to '' . 
  this is n't some kind of game where people follow the rulebook by the letter , this is realpolitik . 
  as far as brussels is concerned , the uk is out already . 
  it will remain part of the common market until it 's official , but nobody is going to care what uk politicians have to say in any eu institution anymore . 
  the uk already lost all of the influence it had in brussels . 
   true face of eu aka `` looking out for its citizens and acting in their best interest '' . 
  if they can gain an advantage by throwing some random outside nation under the bus ( e.g. 
  the uk after it left ) , of course they 'll do it , as they should . 
  the commission is one out of * three * major bodies . 
  and it 's intended to be relatively small and tight , so it can act faster , being the intended executive branch and everything . 
  what 's your alternative ? 
  cutting the commission down in size and locking out small countries entirely ? 
  or blowing it up to hundreds of commissioners , so you get your proper `` democratic '' representation , slowing any kind of decision-making to a crawl ? 
   the european commission , eu 's most powerful organization that 's debatable , very little can be done without commission , council and parliament being in agreement . 
  and the parliament ( elected directly ) can oust the commission president or dissolve the commission entirely . 
   you may find that to be the best method of going about things classical straw man . 
   not like this . 
  representative democracy means that the ruling officials were elected by the public . 
  there are quite a lot of large bodies in the eu ( commission , council , parliament ) , i do n't see why we 'd have to directly vote on * every single one * of them . 
  the primary institution of the eu , that can throw a monkey wrench in pretty much anything , is the parliament , and our mep 's are elected directly by us , every five years , and they in turn elect various other important positions in the eu government , with the rest being elected by the national governments , which are ( hopefully ) all democratically elected by their nations ' people . 
  yes , there are some intricacies that definitely need some improvement , like a clearer separation of powers . 
  but overall i find it ridiculous to call the eu `` undemocratic '' . 
  the government in brussels is overall fairly representative of its constituency . 
  edit : although after all this rambling i 'd like to add that i 'd actually very much be in support of a direct election of the council members . 
  there 's one for each member country , let 's have a national election for each one of them . 
  so i still mostly agree with you , i suppose . 
   who are not anything to do with the eu . 
  well , they do , indirectly . 
  the uk suddenly became a lot less attractive for prospective immigrants from the continent , so if the economy on the isles does n't tank too hard , companies may decide to import more pakis , indians and arabs to fill the vacant spots on the job market . 
  the eu is n't a monolithic hivemind , opinions on the matter of federalization differ quite a lot . 
   i could not do that with an mep ( closed list systems are terrible things ) that was a decision made in westminster , the eu does n't dictate how electing representatives works in its member states . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament#elections ) :  in england , scotland and wales , ep elections were originally held for a constituency mep on a first-past-the-post basis . 
  in 1999 the system was changed to a form of pr where a large group of candidates would stand for a post within a very large regional constituency . 
  one could vote for a party , but not a candidate ( unless that party had a single candidate ) . 
   we are n't a union we are a country ^ _  england itself is the only country in the uk [ ... ], 
  impossible , naturally . 
  why would a single country out of 28 be able to do so ? 
  there needs to be majority in the parliament to oust the president . 
  the council proposes the candidate ( s ) for the president of the commission , ** the members of parliament elect him ** . 
  the council , in turn , is elected by the national governments , ** the members of parliament are elected by all eu citizens of legal age ** . 
  the president and his commissioners draft up new laws , the council and parliament vote on the bills . 
  ** all three entities generally need to agree to pass a law ** . 
  the commission and president are accountable to the parliament . 
  ** the parliament can disband the commission and get rid of the president ** . 
  edit : bolded some bits to stress the powers of the mep 's you elected . 
  y' all did show up the eu elections , right ? 
  edit2 : oops , i somehow thought the article was about the president of the commission , since that 's one of the most prominent political figures ( juncker , currently ) , but it 's actual about the presidency of the council . 
  this presidency is held by entire national governments and rotated around , there is no actual `` president '' of the council . 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  i guess i 'll have to take back what i said , i guess it 's possible they 'd choose to defect . 
  they had what , 96 % in favour or remaining in the eu ? 
   gibraltar rejoining spain . 
  i feel this bit is rather unlikely , if for no other reason than the language barrier . 
  there 'll probably be some kind of special deal of free movement between spain and gibraltar , imo . 
   i never thought i would see an eu without a form of uk leadership , but i think that 's what it has come to . 
  [ ... ] personally , i truly think that they are the biggest loser , by far . 
  this is really the most mind-bogging realisation for me , too . 
  the uk has always been one of the major powers in the union , rarely anything happened in brussels without the agreement of westminster . 
  the brits doomed themselves to become the lapdogs of the eu . 
  i just ca n't see a future where the uk would n't effectively be forced to adhere to eu regulations to remain competitive on the market . 
  just now they wo n't even have a say in developing those regulations anymore . 
  but on the upside , they wo n't have to adhere to eu fishing quotas from now on . 
  but free trade and free movement would entirely defeat the purpose of the brexit . 
  those people voted to be freed from the oh so cruel shackles of the eu , not to regress from spearheading brussels to becoming its lapdog . 
  i imagine many eu politicians are dead tired of british exceptionalism and quietly content that the uk is finally going true on their word and leaving . 
  also less sunshine . 
  way , way less sunshine . 
  even the poor and uneducated in germany massively favour being a member of the eu .
