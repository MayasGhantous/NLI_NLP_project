the way we do politics is completely alien to the eu and the way we do business is different as well i 'd like to understand how different . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  `` the modern german segregates his trash better than he does his races ! '', 
  i 'm not sure . 
  on that map it looks like anatolia is the whole of turkey and not just the eastern part . 
  e * i just looked it up and you are right . 
  anatolia is just another name for `` asia minor '' . 
  it 's greek and just means `` the east '' . 
  i was always under the impression that anatolia is like a eastern province of turkey bordering on the caucasus . 
  i grew up in a partly turkish neighbourhood and anatolia was mostly used ( by turkish people ) as a derisive term for peasants and unsophisticated people ( anatolischer bergbauer ) . 
  i 've been to the antalya/side region a couple of times and i never thought of it as such . 
  hence my question . 
  e * after further looking it seems like it may originally have referred to the area between ankara and konya . 
  apparently . 
  easy as it seems like an eternity since 2001 . 
  antalya is in anatolia ? 
  that is true . 
  guess i even had heard that before . 
  of course they would , that 's why they 're `` kultur ''  but sitting on the sofa , watching `` was guckst du alter ? '', 
  or eating at turkish restaurant or going to a tarkan concert and then telling people you 're doing something cultural would imply that you 're joking . 
  and it 's not some bloke who decides that but all of us together rather slowish . 
  in public perception right now , kulturell is theater , konzert , vorlesung and artsy stuff like that . 
  maybe a vernissage ... 
  `` kultur '' is not really influenced by turkish people or am i missing out here on something ? 
  fatih akin maybe . 
  contemporary culture otoh is of course influenced by turkish people . 
  be it fatih cevikoglu or some other comedian . 
  or turkish rappers or whatever . 
  in regards to contemporary `` kultur '' ... there 's propably a proportional or rather less amount of turkish influence in there , i suspect . 
  in my neighbourhood there 's a turkish theater to which i went twice in like 10 years . 
  just 5 minutes walk , i 'm lazy . 
  there may be others in the city which i do n't know about . 
  like i said , fatih akin 's movies are possibly the most well known examples that 'd qualify for being `` high culture '' . 
  i am not that well versed , there maybe some authors of turkish origin or composers or something . 
  now that i 've come to think about it , all those turkish rappers would be `` kultur '' since they make music . 
  but then again it 's popular music which is not really part of `` kultur '' . 
   singapore , canada , italy or new zealand all of those get their political traditions from europe , do n't they ? 
  i 'm sure there are better examples . 
  well , name me am item of european culture and tradition that comes from turkey ? 
  any artists , composers , literary tradition ? 
  any scientific progress made in turkey ? 
  coffee ~ ~ and d\u00f6ner ~ ~ do n't count  * i was under the impression that d\u00f6ner was invented in germany . 
  i was wrong . 
  it is actually a different form of a dish that goes back to anatolia . 
  i did n't want to circlejerk about our potential military capacity . 
  what i wanted to say is that it is hard to find a place for anything military in german society where it does n't suffer from our eternally hysterical reaction to ww2 . 
  the only thing that would change that attitude is a full-scale military conflict inside eu or na borders . 
  or the obvious threat of such an invasion . 
  that fits our view of war , taught by experience . 
  war is total war . 
  of course we would very cautious if we actually had a large military , neurotic even as to the potential societal risks of having a large military . 
  but as far as public opinion goes , there needs to be a really , really big reason to change the attitude towards anything military . 
   `` b\u00fcrger in uniform '' `` citzens in uniform '' was one of the leitmotifs during the rearmament phase i.e. 
  the 1950s . 
  the bundeswehr was established in 1955 . 
  the concept refers to the changes that were made to the status of soldiers in german law . 
  soldiers were granted certain civic rights which they did n't have prior to 1945 . 
  voting rights and rights to unionize , for example . 
  the concept has frequently been derided as producing civilians in military garb . 
  part time soldiers that work their 9-5 shifts . 
  a bit like i imagine your national guard . 
  my bavarian neighbour makes fun of them as `` all-year-carnival-dress-ups '' . 
   the eu has a military aspect , which is to protect eu soil , i hope germany is not forgetting that part though . 
  it 's either peace or total war . 
  when real war returns , we will go up the attic and open the forbidden box . 
   we do n't believe in half measures . 
  a very german sentiment i might add . 
  either you do it correct or you do n't do it at all . 
   it 's either the swiss guards or the waffen-ss that is not true as we did have a strong military during the cold war and it was n't the ss . 
  why would you bring up your indo-european ancestors when looking at a geological map ? 
  / r/indoeuropeans is leaking again ... 
  of course it does work with bought movies . 
  i was talking about television . 
  the '98 [ movie . 
  [ waisis ? 
  in germany we have the same button as you , of course , but \u00e8 un miracolo if it actually would change the language . 
  seriously ... once a year , maybe . 
  and then it 'll be some finnish indie documentary about crystals or some shit . 
   guess they just do n't know any better . 
  dutchie on his high horse  if you have n't grown up watching stuff in english or were n't that good of a learner and/or talented you might just not give a shit . 
  but you 're right !, 
  most of the people with low language proficiency that i know , have to make too much of an effort to even be able to appreciate the superiority of the original . 
  except fear & loathing !, 
  best german dub ever . 
  and all of that 70/80s bud spencer and louis de funes . 
  back when they had much more leeway regarding dubbing accuracy . 
  that shit is hilarious !, 
  * and i would miss these . 
  funny how nordrhein-westfalen is the only existing state on the map .

  [ the declaration of the truman doctrine on 12 march 1947 inaugurated a series of aid programmes which by the summer of 1947 were mainly concentrated on greece and turkey . 
  these programmes primarily provided military aid , although they also included a strong element of economic assistance . 
  prior to this the united states had been supporting greece financially in an indirect way by means of huge us contributions to unrra .

  [ ... ] economic aid in the years 1948-52 was worth $ 976 million , about half of it being spent on economic reconstruction [ ... ] . 
  while other countries of this region received massive american aid in these years [ ... ] greece received by far the most per capita . 
  even during the civil war , economic aid was as important as military , because it thwarted the communist aim of undermining the government 's authority .
