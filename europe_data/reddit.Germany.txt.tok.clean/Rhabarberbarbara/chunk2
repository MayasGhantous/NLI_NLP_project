  the $ 225 million appropriated foor the fiscal year ending junde 30 , 1949 is limited entirely to military aid since these countries are eligible for economic aid under the european recovery program .

  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truman_doctrine#greece ), 
   the aid certainly was n't sent to avoid post-war austerity or authoritarian regimes . 
  i do think that this was indeed the case . 
  prop up the anti-communist forces to fight the kke and prop up the economy ( not just military funding ) in order to avoid giving the people additional reasons to support the communists . 
   the fact remains ; debt-wise , it 's very hard to find historical examples of anybody who got treated more favourably than post-ww2 germany . 
  i agree with your assertion . 
  and why should n't they have been treated more favourably than others ? 
  germany is a large-sized country in the middle of europe right on the border to the soviet sphere of influence . 
  it possesses more economic and military potential and is in a more volatile state than most other countries at the end of ww2 . 
  securing germany for `` the west '' is of paramount importance . 
   oh , and on the assertion that greece had no place in cold war or `` realpolitik '' . 
  i wrote moral sentiments , not greece . 
  however valid your sentiments may be to an individual 's sense of morality they did not have a place in early u.s. cold war doctrine or in realpolitik for that matter . 
  in order to make your sarcastic remark meaningful you should fix it . 
   debt forgiveness in order to avoid extremely destructive austerity measures and the rise of authoritarian regimes is only ok if ** it suits the interests of those supplying the funds . 
  also works if you are greece ...  [ on the morning of march 12 , 1947 , president harry s. truman appeared before congress to ask for $ 400 million of aid to greece and turkey .

  old news !, 
  [ this was predicted two decades ago . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z33th-jdpdg ), 
  compared to other paper 's comment sections this one looks pretty balanced and thought-out to me . 
  ... and i just sit here redditating . 
  i thought it [ was implemented ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ), 
  makes sense . 
  robert is actually robertson/sen . 
  so in terms of patronymics france is closer to denmark than germany is to denmark . 
  interesting . 
  wonder why there are so many occupational surnames in germany instead of patronymics ... 
  france . 
  does anyone have an idea why the there are so many proper names as surnames ? 
  roger , robert , etc. 
   common destiny i get the feeling that this is the most revolting part for some brits . 
  thanks . 
   emotion and principle what would those be ? 
  and why would n't people want to decide on them ? 
  and those strippers . 
  [ never ] ( http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/22082011/58/london-2012-nazi-anthem-played-canoe-championship.html ), 
  i suspected as much . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  probably . 
  although i 'm always unsure on how to pronounce marcus vipsanius agrippa in french ... 
   what britain needs is reassurance agreed . 
  what would that look like practically ? 
  thanks for your contribution . 
  agreed . 
  if a people calls for a referendum on complex policy issues , should they be given the chance to vote directly ? 
  yes . 
  why would one ? 
  agreed . 
  concerning the european unification process we should n't have referenda because these are likely to be influenced by irrational motives ? 
  but why would one make policy decisions based on historical and emotional topics ? 
   that 's probably the fastest way to get them out , telling germany wants them to do something . 
  i think you may be right but i wonder why that is the case . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  [ yes minister .

  ironically , if we already had said closer political union , a european party campaigning on a platform of the british concerns would find a solid base of voters in almost every country . 
  exactly . 
  most of the eu would never have been able to pull off something akin to the iraq invasion or lybian intervention . 
  those capabilities are essential for our security . 
  thanks . 
  i thought i could use one bigger-than to mark a whole paragraph . 
  germans should really step up their military capabilities . 
  there seems to be a misunderstanding . 
  i quoted from the comment section of the telegraph . 
  sorry this did n't become clear . 
  i 'm not that good at quoting . 
  got ta love those comments though :  when will government listen : the vast majority of people in the united kingdom are fed up with the eu ... why ? 
  the eu is becoming the eussr : dictatorial : greedy : corrupt 2 . 
  the eu is `` a corrupt piggy eurotrough '' : that 's why sleazy politicians love it . 
  the eu is a parasite : a bloodsucking tick on the nation 4 . 
  eu wants to establish a new imperium : a dictatorship 5 . 
  eu leaders are incompetent : eg , ashton is useless a quangocrat 6 . 
  the eu could cause civil war in europe ( vide us civil war ) 7 . 
  the eu want s to impose its multicultural civil rights legal nonsense of the uk . 
  this allows islamic fascists remain here . 
  seven good reasons to hate the eu !, 
  more please !, 
  i assume you are aware of difficulties that can sometimes arise when trying to convey sarcasm on the internet . 
  my excuses because i did n't make that connection . 
  but if his accusation of you being a fag does n't come out of this misconnection then i do n't know . 
  maybe he supports anti-eu movements in finland ? 
  i might be going out on a limb here but it may have something to do with your little hyperbolic title . 
  you do n't seem to be making a point for a discussion to start off from . 
  instead you seem to be fostering an agenda , fag . 
  of ourse they do . 
  it does n't say that anywhere in the text , though . 
  you 're making assumptions . 
   it 's a historical choice both countries have made , and a binding one . 
  it 'd take an even more historic event to really break it . 
  your words ... they make me feel feelings . 
  lovely . 
  now tell him about woosh  and then steve harvey . 
  this is great !, 
  how can the uk parliament invoke art . 
  50 if they 're not the sovereign ? 
   that 's what being part of a federation is .
