  not sure what 's behind this . 
  perceived inferiority ? 
  exaggerated nationalism to cover it ? 
  we 're the romans now . 
  i 've been wondering how they think the whole dabiq thing will work out ... 
  if they succeed in their plan to eliminate the grey areas , we wo n't be the nice romans we are today . 
  the military disparity is gigantic already . 
  they know that or else they would n't be fighting a guerilla/terror campaign . 
  so , the grey areas are eliminated , all muslims are in the islamic state , the west `` shows up '' at dabiq ... what are they going to do ? 
  what ? 
  the heer is still the heer . 
  has been for hundreds of years . 
  you 're confusing armed forces with teilstreitkr\u00e4fte . 
  but that 's much easier as it mostly reflects ownership of the armed forces in general . 
  the names of the individual branches of the armed forces ( army , air force , navy ) reflect their function in the military as a whole . 
  had n't seen that one yet . 
  thanks . 
  what a great bavarian being . 
   i 'm not sure our european ` brothers ' feel as enthusiastic about dying for americans . 
  depends on the scenario , i 'd say . 
  we 're not gon na risk lives for foolhardy ventures like iraq . 
  but if the u.s. were existentially threatened odds are we 'd die for them . 
  what else are we going to do ? 
  we are the west . 
  if she does , though , we 're truly fucked . 
  ca n't you just let me provide some quality butthurt to my fellow neighbour ? 
  who is hopefully joking about contemporary germans being butthurt about a military defeat . 
  you were joking , were n't you ? 
  ah , come on . 
  i know where you 're going but it 's just bants , man . 
  ca n't you just let them have their little moment of military nostalgia ? 
  even though it 's been like a thousand years ago . 
  and no one knows or gives a rat 's ass about that battle ? 
  the political maneuvres that took place in the tory party after cameron resigned are n't yet fully understood by the european public . 
  to blame are : - peoples ' willingness to take johnson 's resignation as further `` evidence '' for the fact that the referendum was just a ploy from cameron to take back ukip votes , which is propably true . 
  johnson only supported brexit to gain political gravitas for a post-remain scenario , which is propably untrue . 
  - the inherent boringness of party internal politics . 
  does [ solingen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solingen_arson_attack_of_1993 ) ring a bell ? 
  ffs, 
  banned on / r/unitedkingdom , afaik . 
  [ piece of cake . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuhk2rsmcs8 ), 
  sounds kinky, 
  nothing about this is beautiful . 
  necessary , yes . 
  beautiful , not so much . 
  how can they fall back to that ? 
  just curious ... 
  other countries propably wo n't mind losing scotland . 
  the uk does n't have that advantage . 
  too late , [ apparently ] ( http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36637591 ) he already resigned . 
  is joke , friend . 
  makes woosh noise . 
   not with 78 m population . 
  single most important point . 
  good one , though . 
  mid - to late 60s for many . 
  the 1st post-war generation is coming of age . 
  ruins are being replaced . 
  jobs for everyone . 
  the economy is humming along nicely , thank you very much . 
  younger folks want the pre-unification germany back . 
  the cozy eighties when they were kids . 
  quite a bunch of little englanders in germany these days as well . 
  every country seems to have their share of them . 
  i have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  nah , we 're cool with winston . 
  [ arthur harris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sir_arthur_harris,_1st_baronet#second_world_war ) on the other hand can fuck off ... 
  right , thanks . 
  where i grew up , people from anatolya were called `` bergbauern '' lit . 
  mountain peseants . 
  the cool kids parents mostly came from the aegean coast . 
  but seriously . 
  what is the english expression ? 
  my turkish barely allows me to ask google : `` cahil anadolu \u00e7omar\u0131 ne demek ? '', 
  ca n't read the answers , though . 
   half of europe has just invaded another country for no reason what are you referring to ? 
  hans  / u/makepolandgreatagain 3 week old account by guy from seattle . 
  mainly posts in r/seattlewa ; r/europe , r/news , / r/le _ pen . 
  highlights include stuff like :  europe is naturally white , good one mehmet . 
  of course he fucking means white , that is what a european is . 
  or  you jews have to constantly come out of the wood works for the smallest slight against semites . 
  you jews are perpetual victims that think you 're the only group to have been genocided . 
  there 's a lot of jew meddling in us politics and media , so maybe there 's a hint of truth in the ayatollahs words . 
  or  nice try schlomo . 
  ill be sure to pop out 5 white kids next chance i get or  religion teachers morality and how to govern ones action . 
  would you say it 's intelligent to completely do away with religious influences and teach the masses right from wrong , good from bad ? 
  id wager it 's possible , but it 's easier with religion to get an entire population on the same page . 
  or  fuck off definition altering marxist . 
  or  better than a bleeding heart , virtuous , compassionate , apologizing useful idiot like yourself . 
  or  but if you get pregnant because you did n't wrap up or forgot to keep up with bc schedule , then i believe you should n't murder someone for your own carelessness . 
  of course not . 
  thanks . 
  according to that guy russians view putin 's involvement akin to `` bush did 9/11 '' . 
  dear russians on r/europe , i wonder how the bombings are viewed amongst the general public in russia . 
  can anyone chime in on that ? 
  [ that 's a tough one . 
  that maybe why the ministry of foreign affairs is just called `` ausw\u00e4rtiges amt '' and not `` bundesministerium des \u00c4u\u00dferen '' . 
  is there some sort of vowel harmony thing going on in greek ? 
  or does that just happen with names ?
