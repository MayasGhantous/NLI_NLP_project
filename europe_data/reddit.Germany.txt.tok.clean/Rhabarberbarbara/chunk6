  why not ? 
  alexander , his officers and troops were all of pure macedonian stock !, 
  there were n't that many greek mercenaries in the army . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ doing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  slow down there , father . 
   the rest can join when they want exactly . 
  why did n't you remain , reap the benefits of being in and when asked to join the `` superstate '' simply decline ? 
  apparently no one is forcing anyone to join . 
  how could the eu even force the uk to join the `` superstate '' ? 
  and why are you not repyling to [ / u/kingofeggsandwiches ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yxllr/leaked_treasury_report_warns_of_painful_economic/dettyfr/ ) comment above ? 
  when in d\u00fcsseldorf ... 
  true . 
  that would make him a moron . 
  completely different thing . 
  nope . 
  it 's just those who give you money . 
  we 've been doing this for centuries all around the globe . 
  not at all . 
  just very poorly formulated on my part . 
  i 'd like to think my observations on social and political matters are somehow well founded . 
  but i often realize that i lack knowledge from `` hard '' social sciences like economics or sociology . 
  i study history and languages which is more hermeneutic . 
  so a pareto improvement would mean to allocate more state support to those who were economically and socially disadvantaged by neoliberal policies after 1980 ? 
  without disadvantaging someone else in the process ? 
   however , if most people today do n't understand this , how could they ? 
  yeah , it 's like common knowledge . 
  i totally knew before looking it up at wikipedia that [ pareto improvements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pareto_efficiency ) refer to  a state of allocation of resources from which it is impossible to reallocate so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off . 
  anus, 
  i 'm increasingly worried that tribalism will get the better of us . 
  those are the fucking easiest flames to fan for putin or anyone to bring the house down . 
  if junk-food is all that is to be had , i 'd definitely would want the better one . 
  you take advice from your anus, 
   coming in herds let 's leave your mom out of this . 
  what a silly name . 
  give it a couple of years and we might be able to exterminate some odd minority again . 
  nobody will believe it . 
   * you 're *, 
  probably . 
  but they should definitely keep their mouths shut until after the election . 
  we even used their [ tanks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panzer_38 ( t ) because they were better than most of ours . 
  i do n't, 
  were n't they later on genozided by the teutonic order ? 
   krum and karl we had the best names back then . 
  sadly , you seem to be right . 
  and the more entrenched opinions and positions become , the easier we 'll be played off against each other . 
  did n't you write a comment yesterday in which you argued that the economic uptick during the nineties somewhat dampened social conflict regarding wealth , ethnicity , etc ? 
  you got downvoted even though that 's a perfectly discussable point , with poverty generally being a fertile ground for extremism . 
  i ca n't decide if it sounds better with beethoven in mind or the german national anthem . 
  check his post history ... 
   i am an expert . 
  no need to disqualify yourself . 
  do n't listen to that guy . 
  our countries are bound . 
  by history , realpolitik , etc. 
  whenever i get anxious about our geopolitical future , that 's my fallback position . 
  however bad it 's going to get , we are not alone . 
   transatmosph\u00e4rien beautiful . 
  ca n't wait to have you guys back in full force . 
  it 's getting dark outside . 
  better walk together . 
  union army = ! = 2 % for nato . 
  if i were to use a refugee wave in an effort to destabilise europe , the wave would be more effective if it crashed along the balkan route instead of germany . 
  merkel took a bullet for europe there . 
  good to see the reich coloured in blue on a map for once . 
  that means we 're the good guys , right ? 
  luckily the courts do n't speak generally . 
  banning a party from the political process is a rather severe infringement on our democratic processes/values . 
  this step should n't be taken lightly . 
  is that what they 're saying over at t_d ? 
  i 'm not a frequent visitor . 
  unlike you . 
  indeed . 
  less populous nations get proportionally more meps .

  browning 's [ ordinary men ] ( https://www.amazon.com/ordinary-men-reserve-battalion-solution/dp/0060995068 ) . 
  we read that in school . 
   for example some german policemen in hamburg were sure jews need tools and other things with them as they were supposed to bulid houses for themselves there . 
  they were of course supposed to round them up and shoot them . 
  you 're * denying * the fact that german citizens ** were ** aware of it . 
  you 're not arguing precisely enough . 
  step your game up . 
  / u/giveme50dollars is going through the classic denial points indeed . 
  / u/new-atlantis though , is n't . 
  yet , you rage against both . 
  the protestant sect from the 1600s ? 
  enforcing the law ? 
  you crazy ? 
  yours is still grammatically correct . 
  just more unusual . 
  i think they 're talking metaphorically ... 
   canadian actor mark schneider , who portrayed napoleon , said that reliving the battle was important because if people do not learn from history , they are condemned to repeat their ** mistakes . 
  ** do n't weaken your centre by assaulting an apparently weak flank if your enemy is a fucking military genius who planned exactly for that ? 
  glad to see you finally appreciating some nuance , 
  kind of a sweeping statement . 
  why , thanks , 
  the bastards . 
  why did you let it happen , though ? 
   i guess ww2 did n't happen i knew it !,
