  but why would they invent such a colossal event then ? 
   will be riight, 
  afd is n't officially an extremist party like the npd . 
  but they 're not conservatives . 
  unless you want to conserve 1932 . 
  they are a radical , fringe party riddled with in-fighting and incompetence . 
  and since they now sell you the proper quality stuff instead of that crappy ee ersatzstuff they used to , you might actually think of buying it . 
  those sneaky fuckers might actually profit from the whole charade . 
  not in poland you do n't . 
  tradition ? 
  hard to imagine nowadays . 
  but those were simpler , more innocent times . 
   triggering the events that formed brexit sure but it 's not merkel 's fault that 53 % of brits fell for the whole scare-the-uk-out-of-the-eu-by-importing-scary-muslims-ploy . 
  those madmen finally served us europe on a platter , gave us unlimited power without even being aware of it . 
  i usually upvote your contributions but claiming that the * german elites are infiltrated by russian intelligence and business * and then pointing to gerhard schr\u00f6der , who has been working for gazprom for over a decade , is a bit pointless because it is public knowledge . 
  you made it sound way more ominous . 
  gerhard schr\u00f6der is n't the german elites . 
  and he is n't secretly working for russian ( and german ) interests . 
  he 's doing it overtly . 
  making a claim like yours and then backing it up with gerhard schr\u00f6der and * my bet is bribery and corruption * is not very profound . 
   to be honest , its quite clear th german elites have been infiltrated by russian intelligence and business . 
  could you get a bit more specific ? 
  what elites and infiltrated how ? 
  minsting-germans , of course . 
  remember , back in 500 b.c. 
  we agreed to invade the continent to kick some celtic ass . 
  everyone was cool except you guys because you 'd rather stay back home to watch the snow fall . 
  so , the adam curtis reasoning then ? 
  i wonder if mitterand really saw it that way . 
  interesting . 
  any idea what his reasoning for this sentiment was ? 
  how are you guys doing temperature-wise ? 
   uk : but , i wos gon na do it , i swear !, 
   eu : i know , i know . 
  you were very brave . 
   uk : does dis mean we ca n't be friends anymore ? 
   eu : of course ve can be friends !!, 
  you silly little bratwurst . 
  now eu kiss it better . 
   uk : sobs yes frau merkel . 
  [ / u/opocajnasogrob ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/6gzkko/schaeuble_german_finance_minister_says_uk_welcome/diuazh4/ ), 
  it just does . 
  [ * the end * ] ( https://youtu.be/swkddkvwlpa?t=21 ), 
   what if turkey leaves nato and allies itself with another soon to be poor nation that actually has nukes ? 
  i wonder what the russian foreign policy agenda vis-a-vis turkey looked like over the last 5 years . 
  how could an experiment involving the integration of thousands of mostly undereducated people , who do n't even speak german , into a highly educated workforce prove to be a success , if you only give it about a years time ? 
  because that 's about the time it took merkel to ask the other european countries to take in migrants after she first `` invited '' them . 
  i 'm not arguing about the topic at hand . 
  but do you really think we 'd come up with a crappy plan like that ? 
  [ guys who say mutti . 
  i think he meant belgium . 
  how did you find out about our plans ? 
  the gospel of diablo is n't canon , yet . 
  those were british colonies not that long ago . 
  of course they are more similar to the uk . 
  remember that germany was n't at war with any major power when they invaded russia . 
  except britain , of course . 
  but there was n't an active land war going on other than temporarily in the balkans . 
  the western front in june '41 was basically an r&r area for the wehrmacht . 
  why would you mark a name in the nominative ? 
  does lithuanian have personal pronouns ? 
  what case does it indicate ? 
  tip your hats to the yankee conquerors . 
  same here . 
  the `` too big , too small '' thing is usually brought up by people like helmut schmidt in order to remind people of the geostrategical situation and it 's challenges . 
  kinda like the old balance of powers ... if we ca n't rule europe so shall no one else . 
  who 's downvoting this guy ? 
  show yourselves !, 
  the frustration pervading your posts never fails to put a smile on my face , 
  brilliant guy by the way . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbxkansr0ia ) a tv report about his mein kampf comedy lecture tour through eastern germany . 
  including nazi hecklers trying to stop the performance but ending up on stage being ridiculed via hilarious hitler quotes . 
  yes . 
  my first thought as well , but you ** could ** get the stuff he listed for 20 $ . 
  that 'd be clothes at kik , dinner at cheap pizza place , 2nd grade beer and weed prices are somewhere between 7-10 $ / gram . 
  and i 'm talking rhine-ruhr-metroplex area . 
  maybe ontario ? 
  have you actually read the post above ? 
  true , true . 
  i almost forgot to downvote him . 
  while being on exchange in britain this happened quite a lot to me until i eventually started to salute back . 
  not the full spring-loaded , clacking your heels thing ... more of a not looking up , desinterested `` yes , sieg heil . '', 
  bankers again ... 
  why should n't we ? 
  `` the leak has been found . '', 
  snurrbart sounds nice , too . 
  this . 
  spain !!, 
  beautiful place , is n't it ? 
  the breivik is strong in this subreddit ... 
  pics or it did n't happen ... 
  easy now , kids ... 
  well , profit  common sense . 
  finally a solution for one of the most pressing issues ... 
  2nd one means : without greece the eurozone would be doomed . 
  3rd one means : even without greece there wo n't be any hope for the eurozone . 
  those poor kids ... 
  what would we do on this subreddit without our token polarizing imbeciles ... 
  just saw the welt link . 
  i ` ma show myself out ...
