  [ here 's ] ( http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/aleqm5jn1z2w5p7m251rzzmqgjlczk8mxw?docid=cng.8f9868e8b56e089616dac967f842d0e4.561 ) a rather superfluous copy of op 's link ... 
  this guy 's hilarious . 
  can we keep him ? 
  even with that disease of his ? 
  down with whitey !, 
  edit : whoa , i never thought the day would come when i had to indicate sarcasm to a brit . 
  this shatters my whole simplistic worldview with races and prejudices and all the fun stuff . 
  well , you did take a lot of land from indigenous people by force , killed millions of them via war and pestilence , had a monopoly on slave trade for a century , tried to take over the whole of europe in the early modern era and had a fascist dictatorship ... 
  i really do n't see any reason why you should n't be considered white . 
  you know the old saying ... friends are made and kept best by starting a joint business . 
   * ` fatherland '  * ` new europe '  * plan of monetary domination over europe  * the future of europe is again at the mercy of germany . 
  is it 1939 again already ? 
  never heard of him but i trust you if you say so ... just hope something good arises from his blog entry in the telegraph . 
  oh , i do n't really care about any rescue/doom plans and their chances of ` success ' anymore . 
  i 'm quite tired of most of it . 
  it 's just the style of the telegraph that 's exhausting ... like ` punishment union ' e.g. , plus the comments are always up for a good fourth reich theory ... 
  why am i even reading the telegraph ? 
  sure thing they need a strong military ... but nukes against hamas would not be your weapon of choice , would it ? 
  stomach cancer ? 
  well , he 's a respected historian iirc . 
  but that 's what you get from people thinking in longer terms . 
  the same with helmut schmidt in germany . 
  although not a historian he keeps talking about the ( un - ) balance of power in europe . 
  you know , germany , too small to dominate europe but too big to not upset the balance . 
  those are valid points to be kept in mind ... but rather somewhere in the back . 
  good , good ... let the meters flow through you . 
  oh , i agree with you on the purpose of life in general . 
  ensuring the survival of your genes . 
  first in your own body and then passing them on . 
  however this must not be confused with the purpose of your own individual life . 
  that one 's entirely up to yourself to fill with purpose . 
  and even though it may sound cheesy and esoteric to some that 's the only thing that will do the trick of living a happy life . 
  some people may find it a disheartening thought that there is no other ` real ' purpose to their lives other than living and passing on their genes and they may turn to imagined higher purposes like religion or ideologies . 
  or they may think that the society they live in does not give them the respect they think they deserve ... that 's , for example , where alienated young muslims raised in western societies and people like anders breivik are on the exact same page . 
  both tend to believe that by subscribing to a supposed higher cause they can elevate themselves above other individuals and give their life more ` meaning ' . 
  that 's what perceived anomie does to certain individuals . 
  i give purpose to my own individual life by trying to be helpful to others , make their lives better , cheer them up , make them laugh , give them a good time and educate them on the things that might be of importance to them . 
  that 's what makes my life better and satisfies me personally . 
  you may going about this way too abstract . 
  constructing a purpose to your individual life from the purpose of life in general is not going to make you happy . 
  it might seem easier than getting a feeling for yourself , for what you feel , for what you want but it is n't . 
  your ancestors 10.000 years ago did n't care about today , they cared about themselves , their children and grandchildren . 
  but not about today . 
  so why do you care ? 
  why do you construct this grand scheme in which you are the defender of 10.000 years worth of life ? 
  elevate yourself much ? 
  why do you think that there has to be somekind of purpose to the life of your ancestors ? 
  what if they lived and died for nothing ? 
  what 's bad about that ? 
  you act like there ' a long-term goal in evolution ... 
  why do you care if in the long-run sub-saharan africans might replace `` your '' people ? 
  how do you actually vote for the klan ? 
   if in a couple of hundred years , your genes are gone , what was the point of your life then ? 
  i 'm afraid you might be over-emphasizing the importance of your individual life compared to life in general . 
  ah , i did n't even notice my tempers were boiling . 
  thanks telegraph , what would i do without you . 
  thanks for posting ... this subreddit needs some light-heartedness once in a while . 
  thanks for the link ... but why does there seem to be a sarcastic undercurrent in that bit ? 
  maybe it 's just more subtle in germany ... but it 's definitely frowned upon in the society at large . 
  except football , of course . 
  i 'm sorry but is this really what this is about ? 
  i kinda suspected irrational motives behind some of what i read about france and england regarding europe but i hesitate to believe that the my-nation 's - dick-is-bigger-than-your 's game is still going on ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvoglgftdk ), 
  yep , read that as ` gay discovery ' ... 
  `` hey !, 
  he comes in peace !, 
  let 's break his legs ! '', 
  you surely must be referring to the austro-prussian war ... 
  so what ? 
  type in `` americans are ... '' and you 'll get ... lazy , dumb , fat . 
  [ kz dachau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dachau_concentration_camp ) was n't built during the war ... try 6 years earlier . 
  why the sarcasm ? 
  sounds like they got bushwacked on that road ... where does the criminal part come in ? 
  three words : football !, 
   do the black people in your country use this word among each other ? 
  i imagine young , male immigrants from sub-saharan africa might pick up the habit as a part of their identity formation . 
  the n-word might become a way of referencing u.s. `` urban '' culture . 
  pure speculation , though . 
  this wo n't answer your question either , but [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8il_zqcknsw ) by two guys from berlin has the n-word all over it . 
  rap-battle context ; nothing racist . 
  one of the guys is black and the other white . 
  they 're using the n-word in equal measure . 
  so , when they performed it [ again ] ( https://youtu.be/af0v4u4hnb8?t=19 ) 17 years later , the white guy had ceased using the n-word while the black guy had kept on using it . 
  i 'm not sure if this was helpful in any way . 
  apparently kruzit\u00fcrken is not even related to kruzefix . 
  it 's a combination of [ kuruzen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuruc ) and t\u00fcrken . 
   i do n't think the rest of germany does rest assured . 
  what about kruzet\u00fcrken ? 
  you guys still using that ? 
  ah , the highroad of loling at typos . 
  but seriously , it 's on [ wikipedia . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/battle_of_greece_wwii_1941_map-fr.svg/500px-battle_of_greece_wwii_1941_map-fr.svg.png ), 
   preferential treatment to a country like slovenia more like a superiority complex . 
  one of our german parties came to power in the 30s via negative campainging . 
  * what has the corrupt weimar system done for those who suffered most from the crashing economy and the inflation ? 
  * one thing lead to another ; germany and europe somehow got destroyed and we came up with this [ more efficient form of democracy . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ), 
  [ la chancla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmij9aklvog ), 
  nothing . 
  all is well .
