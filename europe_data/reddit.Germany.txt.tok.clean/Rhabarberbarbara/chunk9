  [ something like that ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/28/turkish-pm-addresses-immigrants-germany ), 
  nah , i 'd rather have me [ one of these . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inert_gas_asphyxiation#capital_punishment ), 
   i smell a conspriracy by the gastronomy or the church totally . 
  rents around br\u00fcsseler platz are high . 
  and residents , church and gastronomists have been pissed for years about students , hipsters etc. 
  that congregate en masse at the square . 
  are you comparing wikipedia to youtube regarding their informational veracity and value ? 
  mechanical includes digital . 
  all but a live performance is by definition mechanical . 
  [ exhibit a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcv7vn3l3by ), 
  it 's a simple concept . 
   [ unless you declare serbia to be a part of mena ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hprhrrrufu0 ), 
  except for subs . 
  raptor looks great though . 
  russian stuff mostly has better looks but their equivalent is even [ uglier . 
   will you all roll over like you did for the germans in ww2 poor suckers ca n't even afford their own channel . 
  that 's austria . 
  it depends on the context , like you said . 
  when does that resistance flare up in your opinion ? 
   i still consider the uk to be a european country of course they are . 
  one of our best . 
  do n't be fooled by bitterness and banter in the wake of brexit . . russians are europeans too btw . 
  countrysphere rules . 
  ca n't really recall why , though . 
  i think it started out as a mistake and they just kept it . 
   you make people hate all of us . 
  it is my fondest hope that most of us are able and willing to see beyond a person 's flair . 
  how about we come back to the subject of you believing the eu to be an fta ? 
  nah , just kidding . 
  i 'll keep watching you practice rhetorics . 
  it 's ok . 
  i realise you wish the eu was merely an fta . 
   if it 's opposed to free trade get some education on the subject . 
  stop embarrassing yourself . 
   the european union ( eu ) is a politico-economic union of 28 member states that are located primarily in europe . 
  [ literally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) the first sentence . 
   the whole point of eu is free trade  otherwise it basically serves no purpose where did you get that idea from ? 
  your comment , as useful as always . 
   government can not trigger brexit without mps ' backing , court told the court ** was told ** . 
  but let 's not have grammar stand in the way of a clickbaity headline . 
   suddenly dropping from the 5th to the 6th did n't this happen like a couple of weeks ago ? 
  i remember there being threads about that . 
  of course the pogroms and massacres up until 1942 are part of the holocaust . 
  but as far as the systematic annihilation of groups of people is concerned we consider the invasion of the ussr as the starting point . 
  einsatzgruppen only really got going after the invasion . 
  the wannsee conference marks the transition from one method of killing , i.e. 
  holocaust via bullets , to `` organised '' holocaust via camps and gas . 
  video is down , unfortunately . 
  sounds a bit crazy as well . 
  the us supplying al-quaeda ... 
  i was n't even referring to brexit specifically . 
  more like the whole tension between ( cultural ) conservatism , progressivism , nation , identity et al. 
  which has arisen in the face of globalisation and its consequences . 
  brexit is just a part of that . 
  like the rise of the afd in germany . 
  or even isis . 
  these all seem to have the same root cause . 
  maybe we feel a bit more of that in europe because we have to deal with issues of nation , culture , identity and all that on more of a regular base , i guess . 
  bless your iron oma . 
  cause it feels good . 
  great job , man !, 
  this sub seems to have needed some emotional pressure relief after the incident . 
  each of those things is great . 
  the combination is n't bad , either . 
  love me some full english . 
  but i have to do it on the weekend because it 's definitely not the right breakfast to start a working day with ; for me at least . 
  great for a lazy sunday , though . 
  black pudding is great in general . 
  [ himmel un \u00c4\u00e4d ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bf-f67gd_dq/maxresdefault.jpg ) is traditional in my home town . 
  my aunt also makes a nice soup from it . 
  [ blootwooschzupp ] ( https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9gjvjcaedfmd1n8rx8sw-w/o.jpg ) - blutwurstsuppe . 
  english cuisine is much better in terms of stews and pies , in my opinion . 
  totally underrated in germany . 
  this thread is way overblown in view of the ambiguity of johnson 's statement ; at least in written form . 
  audio might clear things up but things have gotten way out of hands anyways . 
  somethin , something same ruling party since 1945 . 
  but you did have your wild days , indeed . 
  until opa bismarck came along . 
  relevant username ? 
   americans or canadians you realize these were british colonies . 
  with british settlers . 
  bringing british culture with them . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  one day i found out half my family came here from france in the 1870s . 
  that was rough . 
  how about you shut the fuck up ? 
  no offense . 
  international law ? 
  i remember that one of my friend 's parents were lawyers who fled turkey after the evren coup . 
  intellectuals who could have also come from spain . 
  my best friends parents came from like east of adana . 
  working class people . 
  they came over in the sixties . 
  four kids . 
  three girls , one boy ; whom i 've known since kindergarten . 
  i spent a lot of my days with them . 
  at their place . 
  at their table .
