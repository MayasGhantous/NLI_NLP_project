* rolf * is a quite common german given name which does n't sound to much as `` adolf '' to german ears ... 
  they * are * thugs , but not nazi thugs . 
  they vow to smash facism and nazis . 
  they * do * smash nazis . 
  that 's not really a nazi thing to do ... 
  i 'd even go so far to say that by far * most * ultras in germany are antiracist and anti fascist . 
  it 's pretty common for [ antifa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antifaschistische_aktion ) and ultra groups to be interweaved . 
  many ultras love beating up nazis . 
  i 've found this interesting map : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/kaufkraft_bier_deutschland.png but it only shows how much people from different regions spend on beer , with the german mean spending defined as 100 . 
  i did n't anticipate losing to austria :(, 
  it 's a * relative * crime rate , the number 's showing the crimes per 100.000 inhabitants , so the difference in population does n't matter, 
  that sounds very much alike to how germans feel about the dutch language :d, 
  you should think about adding russia with it 's second largest city saint petersburg . 
  [ here 's the shortest route from germany to japan ] ( https://i.imgur.com/trzr1dv.jpg ) . 
  so , * yes * , you * have * to cross `` parts '' of russia . 
  but the showers are n't free . 
  it 's 0.5 $ / 5min . 
  at least that 's what i know about the situation at my hometown 's mcfit two years ago . 
  there are different definitions for what is central european and what is eastern european . 
  this is a u.n. map of european subregions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg and here 's a map featured in the german wikipedia : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/grossgliederung_europas.png, 
  but there surely are better indicators of a population 's health thant the * mean bmi * ... edit : typo, 
  i just finished it , thank you . 
  yes , it 's not scientifically impossible for sure . 
  but many germans are just afraid of the `` dangerous radiation thingy '' . 
  this sentence from the article sums it up nicely : `` knowledge is the best measure against fear '' ( `` wissen ist das beste mittel gegen die angst '' ), 
   people are saying there is no way to take care of nuclear waste . 
  and even if there * was * no good way of taking care of nuclear waste : it 's even harder to take care of a very likely , massive global warming which is going to affect everyone on the globe . 
  not only those living in developed countries . 
  shutting down nuclear power plants feels like borrowing our safety from africa ... ( germany is not the country to which global warming poses the biggest threat ), 
  i do n't wish germany would stop on it 's quest to get everything renewable . 
  but i agree with your point that coal power plants are a higher risk for the world than nuclear power plants . 
  it would be perfect if we began with shutting down coal power plants whilst replacing them with renewable energy . 
  step two would be shutting down nuclear power plants , once we are finished reducing our greenhouse emissions to a minimum . 
  btw , i 'm sorry you got downvoted so hard . 
  many people might not agree with you . 
  but you totally add to the discussion . 
  you should remove the [ 1 ] from the end of your link , 
  in this case you could just use minus . 
  read the title as : `` how does germany 's bundestag election work ? '', 
   to make yourself look like such a good person you do realize that most people just enjoy helping those in need ? 
  like , because it 's the right thing to do ? 
  one is not a kind human being for the sake of `` looking good '' . 
  not everybody 's as self centered as you . 
  edit : i 'm sad to destroy your illusion , but those huge tents many refugees live in are heatable . 
  that 's modern tent technology for you . 
  so not that much of a problem with `` freezing refugees '' . 
  well , english does that sometimes , too . 
  example : `` i do n't need no money '' = `` i do n't need money '', 
   they can not accept , let say , 5 million syrians so when they will reach certain limit they will stop accepting more at most , germany could become more strict at sending them back to safe transit nations , that 's true ( as long as there 's a way to proof that a specific refugee transited through a specific safe country ) . 
  on the other hand , compared to other migrant groups , syrian refugees who made it to europe often are quite educated and even speak english , so they might be not * that * hard to integrate into german society . 
  no , they * ca n't * !, 
  the german constitution does n't allow to apply for asylum from outside of germany ( or even from a german embassy ) . 
  please do n't spread wrong facts about a topic you 're not well-versed in . 
   an application for asylum can not be made from outside germany . 
  * [ -- federal office for migration and refugees ] ( http://www.bamf.de/en/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/antragstellung/antragstellung-node.html ) * from their german website :  asyl pers\u00f6nlich in deutschland beantragen : ein ausl\u00e4nder , der dieses recht in anspruch nehmen will , muss einen asylantrag stellen . 
  * my translation : *  personally applying for asylum in germany : a foreigner that wants to make use of this right has to apply for asylum . 
  he can only do so if he is located in the federal republic of germany or if he personally contacts a german border office . 
  it 's not possible to apply for asylum from outside germany or at a german diplomatic mission/ambassy . 
  generally you have to apply for asylum in person . 
  [ -- * federal office for migration and refugees ( bundesamt f\u00fcr migration und fl\u00fcchtlinge ) * ] ( http://www.bamf.de/de/dasbamf/aufgaben/asylverfahren/asylverfahren-node.html ) edit : sorry for being so harsh . 
  and thank you for editing your original post to clear things up , 
   they promised to accept 800k * what ? 
  * i 've never heared that one . 
  germany * expects * 800k asylum seekers to * arrive * this year . 
  nobody said they `` promised '' to accept only this number of refugees . 
  it 's not like germany would stop letting asylum seekers into the country after a specific number was reached . 
  the gulf countries doing wrong is no excuse for the european countries . 
  nobody 's surprised by the gulf countries not taking in any refugees , while many expect europe to do better than those ( which is legitimate , i think ) . 
  `` it 's not right to blame person a when person b is even worse ! '', 
  -- that 's not a kind of logic i like . 
  i 'm from baden and i love you too , my french neighbour :d, 
  the brits like greece , 
  the percentage of baf\u00f6g you have to repay does absolutely * not * depend on your parent 's income . 
  ( and that 's what we were talking about , i think ), 
  in germany you would n't get student benefits from the state if you owned a big range rover . 
  the value of a car is added to the total wealth of a person . 
  if you own over 5000 $ , you 're not eligible for state benefits . 
  but it just did n't make sense to post in this context . 
  you see , i do n't wander around posting `` i like cats '' , even if that 's what most people think . 
  no , it would n't . 
  yes , germans mostly pay in cash . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://qz.com/262595/why-germans-pay-cash-for-almost-everything/ ) an interesting article on it . 
  note : `` perfectly legal according to the institution of the weimar republic '' = / = `` perfectly democratic '',

  how i 'm going to spend it ? 
  easy question . 
  i 'm sitting in the library learning all day , preparing for an important exam on the 9th . 
  us engineering students got no time for that easter stuff ... (-.-) nonetheless , happy easter everybody :d, 
  does n't sound to bad , actually . 
  happy easter , 
  because * why * should they do it ? 
  so the press can start a witch hunt on their families ? 
  there 's no gain * at all * in disclosing the full names of the pilots ( other than endagering the privacy and dignity of their families ) . 
  and in case you still do n't have an idea : europe - eu = rope, 
  wrong , you wo n't conjugate to plural anywhere , not even in the verb . 
  if it 's not clear in the context , you can add some extra words for clarification . 
  but that 's rarely needed . 
  ) * literal translation : * as far as china is concerned , the person is many . 
  * free translation : * there are a lot of people in china . 
  * edit : studying the japanese language , a language which is virtually not related to any other language out there , has tought me an `` out of the box '' view regarding languages , what languages need to function and how different the ways to get a functioning language can be .
