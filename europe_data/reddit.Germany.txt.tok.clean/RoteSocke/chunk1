loi = law travail = labour , work france 's new labour law/reform that liberalises labour relations a little . 
  the government ( socialist party ) argues that it will create more jobs as employers can more easily adjust to the market , while the parties further to the left argue that it 's neoliberal agenda and the expactations will not match reality . 
   right now our species is on a somewhat suicidal course . 
   of course it sounds callous , but i do n't think we can help everyone . 
  half the planet is already a write off . 
  oh it could be , but we would need to change the way our species lives so fundamentally that i think we might not make it . 
  and luxembourg . 
  well if the current trends keep going it 's very possible the greens might take over as the major centre-left party within a decade , with the spd taking a more centrist role of coalition maker . 
  of course that 's speculation of the highest order . 
   a desire to help people would be met by aiding the problem at the source and taking steps to find repeatable and sustainable solutions  [ ... ]  fund such camps where they occur which is also what we are doing . 
  and fighting over how and how much money it should cost is currently a major issue . 
   not blindly accepting anyone that that says they 're from mena to live in your country indefinitely . 
  only people from syria did n't need to show up in person but could instead hand in a written document explaining their situation , the document would still be checked for false statements as thouroughly as possible . 
  every single refugee still has to go through the process . 
  refugee status is limited to the time in which serious bodily danger to the person exists if they where to return to their country , afterwards a long drawn out process begins where the refugees will fight to get permanent resident status which many will not as they will not be integrated enough - and even if they are that did n't matter much to the german government afte the balkan wars where over . 
   acknowledge the demographic imbalance you are creating by absorbing mostly young men into your society and the social problems that will be caused by the culture clash . 
  you think we 're ignoring that ? 
  [ there 's currently an entire thread about the vice chancellor saying the merkel underestimated the challenges of integration . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zx2jy/merkels_deputy_says_she_underestimated_migrant/ ) integration meassures are in the news on daily basis ( once the `` nature is going crazy '' and the `` syria is literally hell '' stories are done for the day ) . 
   it is had to believe merkel 's actions are not driven by irrationality of some kind because they are clearly not pragmatic or sustainable choices . 
  well you could argue that the need to help people is kind of irrational , especially in an eu where the majority of countries do n't agree with that position merkel could have gained much more recognition if she simply closed the borders . 
   war guilt mixed with hopeless naivity seems like the most probable source to me , perhaps i am mistaken . 
  if you want to describe us as hopelessly na\u00efve ( as a socialist , i 'm definitely used to that ) you definitely can , and many of us will disagree with you . 
  but the war barely came up during the actual refugee crisis and even when it did people where talking about the refugees from what is now poland being displaced and them recognising the situation of many syrians . 
  there is certainly a lot to criticise about the execution during the crisis . 
  but execution and intention are two very different things . 
  the german public only really learned about the problem when people where already moving west and northwards . 
  btw . 
  `` fluchtursachen bek\u00e4mpfen '' ( fighting against reasons [ for refugee movements ] ) has been a major topic in german politics which is simply ignored by the international press ( instead focusing on every muslim with knife ) , and germany has pledged and payed money for refugee camps in lebanon and jordan . 
  in fact the german left-wing which has generally only been criticised and demonised by the foreign press during the last year , has taken a position of working on both fronts simultaniously ; taking as many refugees in as possible as well as funding refugee camps and trying to stabilize the region as a whole . 
  hell , for a few days we openly thought about sending the army to fight daesh with boots on the ground . 
  we lacked a plan . 
  that is certainly true , but lacking a plan and having guilt over a genocide almost none of us were involved in are different things and it is deeply unfair to the german people to presume a sentiment which anybody who actually reads the german news thinks is laughable no matter whether they are left-wing or right-wing . 
  the best candidate i can think of is winfried kretschmann , but he needs more experience in government before he can step into federal politics . 
   i think she personally is the politician most damaging to current internal eu relations by forcing deeply unpopular actions upon other countries because of german war guilt . 
  there is no guilt about the war anymore . 
  why is it so hard for right-wingers to believe that we simply believe in helping people in a bad situation ? 
  keep in mind that our republic is a federation , and state governments hold significant influence in federal policies . 
  ignore it , eastern european victim complex is in full effect . 
   how did you contribute the discussion by telling us `` clearly '' does n't hold up in court ? 
  by pointing out the burden of proof is on the prosecution . 
  you need evidence to convict , may it be direct or circumstantial . 
  having a gut feeling ( `` clearly '' ) they 're doing something wrong is n't enough , or at least i 'd hope so . 
   except they were clearly breaking the law and doing so for a very long time . 
  `` clearly '' does n't hold up in court . 
  well if you want to solve the underlying issues of poverty , undereducation and access to mental health care we 'd be all for it . 
  but you do n't want to do that , do you ? 
  i 'll remember not to accelerate if someone is after you with a machete . 
  that 's actually kinda funny . 
  because the two german newspapers that are co-operatively owned are both left-wing . 
  i mean that 's the same media that has called martin schulz populist ... 
  i feel pretty comfortably about the fact that if somebody kills people because they 're infidels , we can reasonably assume them to be islamists . 
   yes . 
  muslims undoubtedly hate liberalist sodomites , as does anyone else with any shred of their fitrah ( inborn human nature ) still intact . 
  feels like i 'm reading moonbattery again , just the words have been switched . 
  islamism . 
  another right-wing crazy train . 
  feminism inspired by islam and the quran . 
  it mostly takes a sex-negative stance but stresses the intellectual equality of women and men . 
  `` dress modestly and study medicine '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_feminism, 
  yeah , it 's not like mexico has any serious issues with organised crime - it must be those subhumans !, 
  did you see me basing it solely on gun ownership ? 
  of course there are different factors . 
  the availability of firearms is one of them . 
  also that thing where guns are essentially outlawed . 
  https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/ same situation in [ south korea ] ( http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/south-korea ) and [ the same outcome ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/strict-gun-control-laws-in-south-korea/ ) . 
  yeah , i 'm thankful most digital dictionaries now come with audio material . 
  okay , that makes a lot more sense after the edit . 
  personally i 'm much more `` offended '' at the fact that i have to juggle pronouns around as soon as there 's more than one in a sentence . 
  why `` je t ` aime '' ? 
  would n't `` j'aime toi '' make infinitely more sense ? 
  why does the sentence structure radically change ( svo -  sov ) if a second pronoun comes along ? 
  it 's like a constructed language where a certain aesthetic ideal was rigorously implemented without giving one shit about practicality . 
  my guess would be / r/all . 
  are you seriously saying that the koch brothers are left-wing ? 
   the nazis were right wing economically ? 
  yes . 
   did they ardently argue for small government , free markets , free trade , fewer entitlements , a more lean welfare-state ? 
  the idea that the nazis were friedmanites like margaret thatcher and ardent readers of hayek is just ludicrous . 
  that idea is indeed ludicrous - but the nazis where for a economic hierarchy and against worker owning the means of production , which makes them inherently economically right-wing . 
  regulation is n't left-wing it 's just sane , but when such basic economics is replaced by libertarian thought the proper labels get deluded and twisted . 
  there are also fascist ideologies that are more left-wing than nazism , mainly [ falangism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falangism )  the nazis believed in government interference in the economy , which is the opposite of what the economic right believes . 
  the question of right-left is between hierachical and democratic organisation . 
   his `` intimidation '' of the press amount to criticizing them as failing , biased , fake news . 
  yeah , no . 
  you remember when [ he had to reconsider whether killing journalists should be a thing ? 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/21/politics/trump-putin-killing-reporters/ ) or that time he has threatend to [ `` open up those libel laws '' ] ( http://deadline.com/2017/03/donald-trump-libel-law-change-new-york-times-1202055770/ ) a.k.a. 
  financially ruin every journalist critical of him ? 
   when he actually starts jailing reporters , or actually abusing their rights , i will accept that trump is acting like an authoritarian . 
  that 's like saying `` i believe they want economic planning when they start nationalising companies '' or `` i 'll believe their anti-semitic when they start gassing jews '' that would be too late ? 
  `` he 's just running his mouth '' is nothing other than apologetics , even if you 're ranting you do n't actually say stuff like that if you do n't believe it . 
   i like the antagonistic relationship between the press and the government . 
  it is how it should be . 
  the american media is not antagonistic towards the government , it is critical of the current admnistration . 
  as soon as trump is out they 'll revert to being the propagandistic mouthpieces they almost always have been . 
  sure they 'll represent different fractions of the complex of oligarchs/government , but that 's about it . 
  trump has banned and intimidated press that reported negatively on him . 
  he has called for violence against political opponents . 
  he 's a nationalist who thinks america of all places is n't nationalistic enough . 
  he 's an unapologetic racist .
