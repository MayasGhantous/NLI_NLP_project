  chosing dubbing over subbing makes a lot of sense when your audience literally ca n't read . 
  that was n't my point and you know it . 
  if it is misused it makes no sense , but it gives you a good idea of what the ratio is between part-timers and full-timers or if that population works a lot of overtime . 
  it would probably more sense as a weekly average . 
  it 's an upgrade and it ai n't cheap ... 
  there is no option anymore . 
  we would have had an option in 2012 by supporting the rebels against assad by putting boots on the ground . 
  that said publicly supporting a guy who has used chemical weapons is bad pr , so we should support whatever can bring peace there and stop daesh , so that at least the killing stops . 
   this is straight propaganda peddled by the terrorist organisations themselves , life is n't as simple as that . 
  no , that 's 70 year old socialist and anti-imperialist analysis . 
   i 've always been in favour of attempting more cooperation with assad do you seriously think that 's something to bragg about ? 
  erm , you know i find that kind of charming . 
  i thought it was funny how different ideas of `` clean '' are in different countries . 
  that 's kinda funny , i though it was almost as dirty as france or belgium . 
  man , i remember getting called a warhawk and imperialist by my fellow socialists and progressives at the time . 
  i was told that it would lead to a bloodbath and an increase in terrorism . 
  5 years later we have a bloodbath , genocide , chemical attacks on civilians , a terrorist organisation that is practically able to attack anywhere , war criminals on all three sides of the conflict , russia gained a foothold in the mediterranean and as a cherry on top the fucking sociopath against all of this went will probably remain in office . 
  we could have established a somewhat stable democracy , ffs . 
  i suspect that if you struck out nato and put eu in the numbers might flip . 
  you say that as if we * were * solving problems ... 
  and he was essential in it 's creation . 
  the german main news show reported on it yesterday evening as well , so it ai n't nothing . 
   celebrate americans ' right to protest . 
  problem is that his party ( or at least it 's leadership ) does n't like that right . 
  france or belgium are generally considered the most likely . 
  mostly because you appear to center it around germany . 
  do n't forget that in a little under two years brexit will actually influence the markets . 
  we do n't know how much yet , because we do n't know what it will entail , but any way you slice it , it ai n't gon na be pretty . 
  i 'm not blaming anybody . 
  i 'm stating a political fact . 
  western europe is n't going to back down on this , and if you think so you 're delusional . 
   korea after ww2 , there have been two de facto democratic states in south korea , one from 1960-1961 and one from 1987 onwards . 
  both where brought about by popular uprisings/long-term protests and against us-backed dictatorships . 
   if germany just enacted policies to increase demand , they would not only help other nations , but increase their standard of living . 
  tax cuts for ordinary citizens and public works programs would work . 
  i agree that it would work , but i would hugely prefer a rise in minimum wage to 9.50 $ or even 10 $ to reducing tax revenue - we have a lot of rotting infrastructure that needs replacing . 
  it 's almost as if some eastern european peoples need to make a very fundamental decision what is more important to them . 
  because one thing is clear , the idea that the western european countries will bend and inch on this is a pipe dream . 
   the white percentage in america is not easily defined . 
  thanks to census data , it actually is very easily definable it only depends on who you consider to be white . 
  if you go by skin color it 's 72.4 % . 
  if you believe that only people who do n't speak spanish as their native language could possibly be `` real '' whites it 's about 61-65 % . 
  although that makes exactly zero sense as a white mexican is no different from a white american or a white spaniard , other than being from a different culture , which means you 'd have to find some other word for that . 
  if you went exclusively by language as somehow indicative of culture and thinking you 'd arrive 79.2 % english speakers ( main language at home is english ) plus a few percentage points for other european languages - so about 81-82 % . 
  of course this would exclude spanish speakers . 
   also that site is a german site and i am not in a position of using a translator . 
  ok , let me help out for the graphic : 79 % germans without migrational backgrund ( migration to germany happened more than 3 generations ago , so presumably ethnicly german ) 21 % have a migrational background . 
  this splits up between 11.5 % of germans with migrational background ( citizens ) and 9.5 % foreigners . 
  notice that there is no real split according to ethnicity or race made between these groups . 
   germany is still a large majority white country yes , of course that is n't what you actually said , but oh , well . 
  according to the migrationsbericht 2015 and whoever copied this into wikipedia , germany splits up like this : 79.0 % germans ; 11.0 % other europeans ( -- incl . 
  3.5 % turks ) ; 7.0 % asians ( -- incl . 
  2.3 % middle eastern ) ; 0.8 % africans ; 0.5 % americans ; 1.7 % unspecified of course you 'd have to substract all the hispanics from the other europeans and i imagine you 'd want to substract the turks . 
  so it 's 85 % - still far away from 95 % you used in your comment . 
   that has never completely moved on from its past . 
  if moving on from our past would mean that we 'd describe poles and other eastern europeans kidnapped and forced to work in what is essentially slavery as [ immigrants and workers ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/publisher-promises-revisions-after-textbook-refers-to-african-slaves-as-workers.html?_r=0 ) , i do n't think we quite go there and i guess most people from eastern europe would agree with that . 
  but of course that 's not what you meant and i 'm being a bit of a prick about this . 
  the myth of german guilt is n't relevant anymore . 
  german guilt does n't exist anymore . 
  me and my generation of germans do n't feel guilty for what our grandfathers did because we did n't do anything , because that were our grandfathers not us - maybe it 's a bit awkward when meeting jews for the first time but that 's about to be expected . 
  ironically it 's exactly this sentiment that drives the welcoming culture here , because we understand that a person is independent of their group especially if that group is n't a legal entity . 
  it 's kind of sad that identity politics in the us are as strong as they are as it would be great if more white americans would n't feel personally attacked when other groups made a complaint about a perceived injustice . 
  how about we look up numbers instead of pulling them out various bodyparts ? 
   germany is still something like 95 % german . 
  try [ 79 % ] ( http://www.bpb.de/wissen/ny3swu,0,0,bev%f6lkerung_mit_migrationshintergrund_i.html )  when it hits 60 % [ 72.4 % ] ( https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf ) of americans are white . 
  i 'm assuming you mean `` white '' , given that you mentioned `` third world people '' and the overwhelming majority of people who live in countries considered third world are n't white . 
  should n't we be talking about native americans anyway ? 
  after all , the white people are the decendents of immigrants in this instance . 
   define `` more active '' . 
  given natives are 95 % of the population , one would expect there is more to recruit from . 
  sure thing . 
  numbers for politically-motivated crimes taken from the [ `` politisch motivierte kriminalit\u00e4t im jahr 2016 '' - report ] ( https://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/nachrichten/kurzmeldungen/2017/pmk-2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) from the ministry of the interior . 
  verfassungsschutzbericht 2016 has n't been published yet , so i used numbers from 2015 . 
  o | pmc2016 | pmc2015 | adherents | ratio 2016 | ratio 2015 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- islamist | 773 | 680 | ~ 10,000 ^ 2 | 773/10 ,000 = 0.0773 | 680/10 ,000 = 0.068 far-right | 23,555 | 22,960 | 22,600 | 23,555 / 22,600 = 1.042 ^ rd | 22,960 / 22,600 = 1.016 ^ ru far-left ^ 1 | 9,389 | 9,605 | 26,700 | 9,389 / 26,700 = 0.352 ^ ru | 9,605 / 26,700 = 0.360 ^ ru ^ 1 purely for control . 
  ^ 2 exact numbers for established terror organisations not certain , general guess from the report . 
  ^ rd rounded down ^ ru rounded up now what is noted in both reports is that islamist attack tend to be much more deadly than violence from far-left or far-right . 
  none of this is saying that nothing should be done , but just because you do n't hear about it in the media does n't mean nothing is happening . 
  pretty sure she 's a european muslim . 
  thanks , that was one of those homonym brainfarts i 'm chronically afflicted with . 
  i 'm assuming they equated `` on welfare '' with poverty as it has been done [ previously ] ( http://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/kinderarmut-bertelsmann-100.html ) . 
  this is a highly regional problem that has been perpatuating for the last few decades . 
  previously middle class worker-dominated cities in the ruhrpot and elsewhere have fallen on hard times as previously established industries have seized to exist ( mining ) or moved abroad . 
  in the early 90s we made the mistake of giving the east money to modernise instead of creating a country-wide fund to support any struggling region . 
  so these cities that already had problems were n't high on the list and kept paying for infrastructural modernisation in the east . 
  now we have a bunch of cities with bad infrastructure ( we call those cities and regions `` strukturschwach '' ) and systemic poverty sprinkled around the country . 
  we are already trying to help those places but thanks to our federal structures these kinds of projects need a long time to start . 
  the process once started will probably still take several decades as new industries have to be established . 
  this is of course a gross oversimplification of the situation . 
   20 year old are not the victims of 40 years of propaganda well of course you can only be a victim of propaganda as long as you 've been alive ( if we count from birth ) . 
  i think it was mainly / r/unitedkingdom , but i 'm honestly not sure anymore because i think it may have been another account . 
  or rather , you 'll be told by foreign media that you where right while blazenly ignoring all statistical evidence and sensationalising a few incidents and ignoring thousands of incidents of anti-immigrant violence . 
  for the rest , look at my other answer to lines_between_words . 
  i do n't have anything to answer because he 's assuming that i take position which i do not take . 
  that is what a `` strawman '' is . 
  this is n't a fucking debate club in high school . 
  i will not subject myself to an idiot berating me because he 's unable or unwilling to properly read . 
  if he , ** against his very own denial ** , by `` mass immigration '' means the influx of legitimate refugees from syria , iraq and eritrea than the answer is what it has always been an most probably always will be : of course there 's a few bad eggs in them and those should be removed from our country , but most of them are just looking for a peaceful place they can live and that accepts them if they integrate . 
  read my first post responding to you again . 
  you are arguing a strawman here and i wo n't bother with this idiocy anymore . 
  uhm .
