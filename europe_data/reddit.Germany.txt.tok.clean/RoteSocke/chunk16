  i get that ( although i 'm certainly not seeing it here in germany ) . 
  i do n't want to copy the american system , i 'm just saying stick to the written word for political commentary on us policy if you do n't want to get yelled at . 
  and you know what ? 
  after following american politics for almost a decade , i wan na go in front of a camera and yell a bit too . 
  they make american political commentary for americans about mostly american politics . 
  yelling is implied . 
  well , if you 're ideologically opposed to free markets ( or the supposedly free markets we have ) being tinkered with than that opposition is clear . 
  they do exist .

  the problem with cooperatives is that you have a really hard time even founding them , as you need funding . 
  of course private banks are n't exactly to giddy about the idea as you do n't really have public face but deal with a group of people . 
  so we market socialist came up with the idea of public developement banks entirely serving cooperatives , banks like [ kfw in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kfw ) or the [ nordic investment bank in the nordic countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_investment_bank ) but specifically to provide funds for co-operatives . 
  they would still act financially responsible in giving out loans ( you would still need to present a viable business plan - one that gives the bank a good indicator that they would get that money back ) but it would solve the funding issues . 
  coops may outcompete private businesses but that is n't the point of a coop , the point of a coop is to improve the lives of their members . 
  a transition towards a cooperative-based economy would greatly benefit us all . 
  i hope you have a good amount of studies to back up that claim , because sheer conservative cynisism is n't going to cut it .

   we will establish the principle that , when a company is closing , workers have the right to run it as a cooperative fucking finally , a real socialist . 
  not just somebody who calls themself one for the pr . 
  / s nah , that 'll be the first thing they 'll drop in negotiations . 
  after all , ca n't have the workers empowered in co-ops .

   repressend workaholic overlords hey !, 
  that 's ... that 's ... entirely accurate . 
  it 's a winning strategy . 
  it 's also a great way to make poeple apolitical : let them down a few times and tell them `` all politicians are the same '' . 
  it 's not that the letter looked fake , it 's that it was a letter . 
  normally daesh claims responsibility via e-mail . 
  because when your terrorism implies blowing yourself up carrying a letter with you is n't exactly a good idea . 
  i know . 
  i wanted to make him google stuff for an hour before he gives up completely frustrated . 
  btw . 
  the gema blocking has ended , so his comment is even more painful . 
   you cant really defend a censorship state that 's so corrupt they even have 25 % + of youtube content blocked ... gon na need a source for that before i believe you . 
  \\* western europe, 
  merkel is mostly tolerated because of a lack of other options . 
  oh please . 
  we 're no better than other countries . 
  and merkel has so little vision she may be legally blind . 
  she 's a power hungry opportunist , that 's it . 
  germany is currently leading the eu because we came out of financial crisis unscathed . 
  this is the case because most of us have the option to put our money in public banks and credit unions and actually do so ; so that only rich people had legitimate fears of their money disappearing . 
  so nobody got hurt and we kept spending . 
  as everyone else 's houses were burning we were the only ones who could run things . 
  we should n't stay in this role any longer than needed . 
  i was n't telling you what to think . 
  sorry if it came off like that . 
  i was just explaining we 'd be more concerned about her grading him favourably than the creepiness factor or some kind of statutary rape thing . 
  over here it 's more like `` you 've got genitals and you 've got genitals , as long as both of you agree to use them , why should we care ? '', 
   when you say `` federal europe '' , i assume you mean a superstate , with a central authority , that dictates policy for the entire eu , with minimal involvement from local governments / parliaments . 
  no not at all . 
  it 's a federation after all , not a centralised state like france . 
  what you 're describing does n't reflect my experience of growing up in a federation at all . 
  all the different tiers are involved in many decisions . 
  you could even have a swiss-style safeguard in the constitution that says that only what is explicitly said in the constitution to be federal resorts can actually be done by the federal government . 
  yes , you would have different resorts like taxes , healthcare , some general guidelines for education , maybe traffic laws and some parts of criminal laws be federal resorts but lower tiers would still be able to add to that - that 's how a federation works . 
  and yes general immigration policy would be a federal resorts ( simply because border control ) but do n't forget that you would still get a vote in european institutions so you would be able to participate in the process and most probably your concerns would be heard . 
  honestly i think we lefties would lose that battle . 
  look if that 's not sovereign enough for you you 're not a federalist and thats absolutely fine , fight us like hell . 
  but we do n't want to wipe hungarian culture of the map to create some plastic general european or something . 
  in fact we want a federation partially so that does n't happen . 
   oh we absolutely are . 
  i was n't , of course what you are doing is a different matter . 
   claudia roth sued someone who called her disgusting ( ekelhaft ) online and was awarded several thousand $ by a court . 
  no she did n't and she was n't . 
  a district attorney started the process and the monetary payment was a `` geldstrafe '' not `` schadensersatz '' . 
  also that was n't the only thing that trial was about , there was also that part where he called his parent 's neighbours `` damn foreigners '' and hammered against the door so hard that their children woke up . 
  i can take a seat next to the fireplace , you can bring some marshmellows . 
    and it wo n't be an `` agency '' of the government  nope , maas wants monitor facebook and other social media sites to build a `` task force '' against fake news with companies like correctiv gmbh , who have been quite biased in the past . 
  i was talking about libel laws and fake news , you 're talking about volksverhetzung . 
  those are different things . 
  volksverhetzung is already illegal and the task force is to enact the laws already on the books . 
  you wan na talk about gassing people on facebook you 're going to have to repeal the articles on volksverhetzung . 
   remember , initially the official version of new year 's eve in cologne was that everything went perfectly fine . 
  it was only after the news was spread on facebook that officials were forced to admit that hundreds of freshly arrived asylum seekers had commited sexual assaults against german women . 
  i know trumpenstein has muddied what fake news in english , but the rest of the civilised world is still applying an actual definition . 
  fake news is news that have no basis in reality or are even counter-factual - and are even clearly proven to be so . 
  witness statements make this not fake news . 
  the reports may be wrong , the witnesses may be lying but the person writing the article did n't just make it up . 
  in this case it would be a falschmeldung ( false report ) in german terms . 
   so no , i do n't want `` fake news '' to be a punishable offense banned from social media because it can very well turn out be true news , uncomfortable for those trying to ban it . 
  yes , that 's why they called it fake . 
  because it can turn to be true . 
  by the way , i have a invisible unicorn that farts invisible rainbows to sell you . 
   the sensible exceptions like yelling fire in a crowded theather or bomb threats do apply . 
  oh , so you do actually a agree that lying if it 's dangerous should be illegal ? 
   any liable platform would massively delete content as a consequence . 
  it is not hard to see these implications . 
  maybe they should leave it up , if it is in the grey area and only remove when they are sure . 
  you can still remove it after a complaint and they 've had it vetted by lawyers . 
   i read a lot of comments that i do n't like but that does n't matter at all . 
  it 's not about comments i or you do n't like , it 's about counter-factual information or reports on literally faked websites with no basis in reality . 
  just look at the influence of fake news on the potus election last year , it 's going to be eye-opening . 
  yeah , it 's hard to enforce laws on the internet , but we 've recently seen what kind of damage fake news can do to a person with the pizzagate conspiracy theory . 
  i think we need to try everything we can to stop something like that happening here . 
  you want the internet to be an extralegal space ? 
  where laws do n't apply ? 
  we 're not talking about insults here , that 's anglophone newssite clickbait . 
  we 're talking about libel .
