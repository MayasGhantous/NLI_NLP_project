  but you 're wrong now ! '', 
  do n't forget the entertainment industry . 
   and what has `` political correctness '' to do with this ? 
  it 's pseudonym for `` humanising brown people '' . 
  i know the feeling . 
  before 2015 i would have estimated the percentage of racists here to be like 5 % . 
  turns out i was off by about 10 percentage points . 
  damn ... 
  it 's okay [ we do n't really want to anymore anyway .

  i 'm not wrong . 
  i 've done everything i can to explain it to you and you are either utterly unwilling or absolutely unable to follow basic economics . 
  i 'm sorry , i 've done all i can for you . 
  you 're either a troll or an idiot . 
  either way i 'm not going to waste my time anymore . 
  how about anti-irish and anti-italian sentiment in the states ? 
  you call it ideology , we call it ethics . 
  snide remarks are my style . 
  i 'm really just amazed how little you actually know about the topic . 
  like this should have been taught to you in school , but ok then . 
  the work force is 100 % of the workers willing or able to work . 
  they split into employed and unemployed . 
  the distribution of genders is usually about 50:50 . 
  the distribution of employed vs. unemployed is much more imbalanced ranging from between around 95:5 to 60:40 ( of course more extreme ratios can exist , but at that point you 're so deep into a recession it does n't really matter ) . 
  given that we generally have more jobs than people of either gender you 're going to have a mix of genders at the workplace . 
  of course there are other factors like qualification , age , biological specificities relative to the job , etc. 
  one of those factors is unequal pay . 
  if you now have an employment vs. unemployment ratio of 92.5:7.5 which radically changes to an ratio of 70:20 companies will have to make up 12.5 percentage points of unemployment to stay in business/profitable . 
  what will they base their decision on whom to fire ? 
  the previously mentioned factors , of which unequal pay is one . 
  ps : please buy an econ 101 book . 
  do i need to spell everything out ? 
  going after comedians for making fun of him . 
   schulz the new shooting star of the social democrats being over hyped ? 
  in the sense the he is a bubble that will soon burst . 
  it 's carneval . 
  like in rio de janeiro we have parades with costumes , music and floats some of which are political . 
  we also have comedians ( b\u00fcttenredner ) who do horrible puns and political comedy in big tents and halls - again with music and alcohol . 
  what we do n't have is half naked ladies dancing , but i mean , it 's february after all . 
  the traditions vary by region , for example here in the south-west politics and music does n't happen during the parades but `` we '' ( well , other people ) put on scary masks to scare the winter and it 's evil spirits away - after that we consume a different kind of spirit . 
  you should read the rest of my comment as well . 
   for ruining their beautiful country . 
  it 's okay we know you 're only trying to move south through our country , we can take that many cheeseheads for a few weeks and fix the damage later . 
  women are n't 77 cents on the dollar . 
  that 's a misleading overall statistic , if you actually compare it on the same job it looks a lot more like this :  [ even when comparing the sexes with the same job title at the same company and using similar education and experience , the gender pay gap persists : men earned 2.4 percent more than women on average , down slightly from last year , payscale said . 
  ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/05/men-still-earn-more-than-women-with-the-same-jobs.html ) so in reality it 's more like 98 cents on the dollar . 
  the other reason is that there is a limited supply of women to be employed once you go through the fact the women are not an unlimited resource and qualifications for jobs being [ slightly important in the american economy ] ( http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-trump-manufacturing-ceos-meeting-20170223-story.html# ) . 
  what you have described has actually happend before and keeps happening in an assbackwards way with every recession :  the percentage of the working-age population employed fell substantially between 1930 and 1940 , as shown in table 1 . 
  virtually all of the decrease occurred among men , with the proportion of the male population with jobs dropping 10 percentage points to 67.5 % . 
   men continued to dominate the ranks of the employed during the 1930s despite the great depression 's very different impact by gender . 
  the number of men employed fell by 898,000 over the decade , while the number of women employed rose by almost 1.3 million . 
  women 's share of employed persons consequently grew to one-fourth by 1940 .

  men account for at least 7 of 10 workers who lost jobs , according to the latest bureau of labor statistics data . 
  blue-collar men have suffered 57 % of the job losses . 
  and blue-collar white men , who make up only 11 % of the workforce , constitute 36 % of those who have lost jobs . 
  in total , nearly half of the recession 's casualties are white men , having held 46 % of all jobs lost .

  which is why i thought i did n't need to mention it . 
  apparently i had to . 
  but that 's just the thing . 
  if you have discrimination you do n't need to pay so much . 
  let me rephrase that so it 's save for people who do n't know much about economics :  there is n't any scenario where you pay workers more * than necessary * and make more profit, 
  let me put it this way : it is a question of getting rich now but murdered by angry masses in a few years or staying a little less rich and getting to die of natural causes . 
  i disagreed with the idea that equality and profits are n't in opposition . 
  equality is not in opposition of stability but profits and stability are in opposition to each other . 
  which means that if you wanted profits short-term you should discriminate based on something random * but * if you want long-term you want stability which means you 'll have to give up some profits for stability - the very fact that you do have to give up some profits for stability through equality is evidence for that oppositional setting . 
  there is n't any scenario where you pay workers more and make more profit ( equality \u2191 \u2192 profit \u2193 , equality \u2193 \u2192 profit \u2191 ) , there is also no scenario in which instability causes more profit in a broad sense - of course single companies may profit - ( instability \u2191 \u2192 profit \u2193 , instability \u2193 \u2192 profit \u2191 ) ; but equality and stability go hand in hand ( equality \u2191 \u2192 stability \u2191 , equality \u2193 \u2192 stability \u2193 ) . 
  does that explain what direct opposition is ? 
  she raised more money because stability matters . 
  if you put people into a situation of oppression you either have to make them believe they have deserved it ( racism , sexism , religious morals ) or they 'll revolt . 
  by giving up a little bit of profit for the illusion of equality ( and the illusion of fighting an oppressor ) you ensure loyalty to the exisiting system . 
  meanwhile you insure that people like bernie sanders and real socialists are seen as `` dreamers '' who 's ideas `` could never work '' just because ( what is actually used is the thread of losing more than you currently have by equating a totalitarian system with economic democracy ) . 
  equality is in direct opposition to profits , because if you can discriminate on wages against certain groups and still sell for the same amount of money , you 'll make more profit . 
  it 's only counter-intuitive if you do n't know economics and have grown up with the `` profit motive makes efficient '' - fallacy . 
  in any private system there 's always profit to be accounted for , in a public system it is not . 
  which means that at maximum efficiency the public one will be cheaper . 
  an often heard argument is that the profit motive drives down prices , which is theoretically true if people acted like mathematical functions , but that 's not how people work . 
  because if there is a silent agreement between providers not to actually compete for costumers , but instead if they all offer equally shitty services for equally high prices they all profit . 
  it 's game theory at it 's finest . 
  a public system lacks the profit motive to seek efficiency , but it is replaced by the motive those who control it to stay in power . 
  the government which is elected , needs to keep the system in a good state , so come election time it wo n't be replaced . 
  one could argue that competition is shifted from different actors all offering the same product to different actors offering different * control as a product * . 
  at any rate the import thing to understand is that profit does n't need to come from competition but can come from exploitation and efficiency does n't need to be rewarded with money if other things can be offered . 
  that does n't mean that a state-monopoly is the only possible functioning system - the profit motive * can * lead to better products for less money - but what it means is that it depends on the environment ( the product , the society , the level of technology ) which one will deliver the better quality . 
  i think you need wallet dude . 
  ^ the ^ word ^ is ^ borrow , ^ not ^ [ barrow ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/barrow#noun_2 ), 
  also the `` immigrants cause crime '' rethoric is bullshit . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) a list to get you started . 
  red-red-green was possible after the 2013 elections as well . 
  it 's an old phenomenon of the post-ww2 german right-wing . 
  whatever right-wing party gets popular is immediately invaded by neo-nazis in suits , who then make crazy outlandish claims which damage the party 's image , which then makes the party collapse in polls and leads to the somewhat moderate right-wing leaving and going back to the cdu/csu until another one pops back up . 
  maybe the afd will be able to clean house fast enough , but if they do n't do it fast enough they might not even make it into the bundestag . 
  and even then , the far-right voters might not even go back to them but either stay home again or really just straight up vote for the neo-nazi party ( npd ) . 
  well that 's a different group from what the protestors are saying ( if both the german and english article i 've read are n't completely shitty translations ) . 
  one are refugees from war torn countries like syria and iraq or crazy dictatorships like eritrea - the other one are economic migrants who are trying to get to a rich country so the can get a job and send money back home or stay there for the material whealth . 
  those are two different sets of motivations , statuses and people . 
  i think most of us would make a difference between almost going bankrupt on accumulated debt and needing money to help somebody out . 
  what do you think they want ? 
  you think they have a real hankering for lutefisk or sauerkraut ?
