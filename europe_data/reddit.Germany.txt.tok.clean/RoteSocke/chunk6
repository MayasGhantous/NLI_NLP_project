  i disagree . 
  if people want a meritocracy it is important that the only qualifying criteria is their previous work such as grades or paid internships with recommendations . 
  as soon as you start demanding money with no phrasing to essentially void it - no matter if it is for college , university , or vocational school - you 're shutting out the children of poor people to at least some degree . 
  die linke started campaigning for it in 2006 after for several years temp agencies were used to undermine unions . 
  i admit to being too lazy to take on the mountain of bullshit that is the rest of their statement . 
  so , you 're just going to ignore my argument and act offended ? 
  dw is not a newspaper ... 
   if we keep accepting thousands upon thousands muslims there will be criminals in those circles and the last thing we want is to endanger our own countrymen . 
  unless you can find me a country or any other group of people with a crime rate of 0.0 you can use that for any group you choose . 
  the point is that liberal societies should not dictate behaviour relating to personal matters if it only affects one person . 
  if you 're a christian and gay , and believe that homosexuality is a sin no liberal democracy should , could , or would force you to embrace your sexuality . 
  we can argue for it , but liberation is a thing a person has to do for themselves - and that 's assuming that taking off a hijjab is actually liberation and not a way to give the male gaze an object which is an argument you can hear from islamic feminists .

  every single part of the more liberal idea of market socialism already exists in practice and much of it for more than a century . 
  for example the italian province of [ emilia-romagna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emilia-romagna#economy ) has the third highest gdp of any italian province - one third of it 's economy is worker coops and 2/3 of it 's population are members of some coop . 
  another example that is often mentioned is the [ mondragon corporation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mondragon_corporation ) , but you will very reasonably find a cooperative somewhere close to you . 
  may be a caf\u00e9 , a book shop , bike shop , a factory or something completely off like a legal firm . 
  ( a ) [ coop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coop_\\ ( switzerland \\ ) ) is one of the biggest supermarket chains in switzerland having a membership of around 2.5 million people and as of december 2016 employing more than 85,000 people . 
  the examples for housing cooperatives , credit unions and mutual insurance providers are so plentiful that i 'd really just ask you to consult the responding wikipedia articles . 
  historically yugoslavia had a much more free economy but it was n't purely market socialist . 
  germany has a thing called codetermination where half of board of directors of any publicly traded company is there to represent the employees as it reigns in the greed of the other half ( well , unless it 's the automotive industry it would appear ) . 
  cuba has been moving towards cooperatives after the government tried something and noticed that the workers in coops where happier and more productive ( feeding your people is great you see ) than in the previous command-based planned structures ( which still make up the majority of the cuban economy ) - [ in fact ] ( https://www.thenation.com/article/worker-cooperatives-are-more-productive-than-normal-companies/ ) they are also more productive than capitalist enterprises . 
  well , there are many ideas and describing them all would make this comment pretty long , so i 'll stick to the most popular model of so-called `` alternative economics '' : market socialism . 
  in fact there are two different ideas of what market socialism ought to look like . 
  the more statist variant proposed by pranab bardhan and john roemer would have all companies owned by the state and managed by the people who work in them , then a stock/credit scheme distributes profits based on some value the people predetermined ( for example time , productivity , or some mixture of the two ) . 
  this is the less popular variety . 
  the more popular variety could be called liberal market socialism , as it advocates to replace privately-owned companies with cooperatives ( worker coops , consumer coops , and housing coops ) , privately-owned banks with credit unions , and privately-owned insurance companies with mutual insurance companies . 
  generally the advocacy is towards transitioning everything from privately-owned institutions towards some kind of social ownership may that ownership then be cooperative , public , or common ; this is based on the idea that the common interest collides with greed consistently and capitalism in fact pushes people to side with greed leading to widespread poverty , elitism , and environmental destrustion . 
  the debate of planning vs. market is often declared to have to be determined by experimentation in a specific field - for example it is generally conceded that health care , education , fire departments , and many utilities ( water , electricity , etc. ), 
  is better off publicly planned but it is also condeded that sector like it are better of in competing projects . 
  this kind of market socialism has deep ties with the new economy movement , eco-socialism , alter-globalisation and altermondialism , the cooperative movement , the open source movement , permaculture , social justice activism and minority rights activism as well as labour unions and expanding all the way to such movements as geurilla gardening , degrowth and freeganism . 
  one fundamental tendency in all of these in the last few years is a turn from the macro-economics to the micro-economics , from the global to the local - basically `` if we all fix our houses , streets , blocks , cities , regions , etc. 
  we 'll fix the world '' . 
  classical proponents of this economic structure include david ricardo , john stuart mill , and pierre-joseph proudhon . 
  like there 's only two options ... 
  they are politicising the issue to create a narrative that sounds interesting . 
  clicks , it 's all about them clicks . 
  reporting on what the other parties are saying about this is just good reporting . 
  it was federal law . 
  on the plus side the amount of people that would attack you over it and not just silently judge you is rather small . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ess#usage_notes not from a linguistic standpoint . 
  because of the connotations and wider discussions on the subject putting gender-specific suffixes on words is almost by definition a political statement . 
  so , do so if you want to make that point , do n't if you do n't think so . 
  but be aware that you may be attacked for doing it . 
  yeah i thought that too . 
  did we still require a written permission from their husbands for wives to be allowed to work in 1958 ? 
  it feels like we still did back then . 
  edit : just looked it up , that law existed between 1958 and 1977 the one before that was even worse . 
  there 's hell of a difference between proping up autocratic regimes and choosing not cooperate with autocratic regimes but doing so with democracies . 
  the solution would be making the countries of origin good places to live . 
  democratic , secular , prosperous places . 
  that is n't going to happen by supporting corrupt semi-autocratic goverments with more than questionable human rights records that assist privately-owned highly exploitative businesses in voiding labour protection laws while telling people how oh so pious they are . 
  not even we leftists say things like that . 
  there was a report that the refugees from syria where better educated than the german government first thought but that 's about it . 
  do n't forget about the government of that same military directly funding islamist terror organisations and islamist governments supportive of those organisations against those horrible communists . 
  after all who cares about a few million people having to live under theocratic governments as long as the money can flow freely . 
  you should have a conversation with the [ european court of human rights ] ( http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng# { % 22dmdocnumber % 22 :[ % 22860012 % 22 ] , % 22itemid % 22 :[ % 22001-96389 % 22 ] } ) . 
  edit : apparently because i link to a court document it must mean i agree with what is in it . 
  i do not . 
  i consider it one of the worst judgements in european history if not the history of our species . 
  the treaties need to be renegotionated if we ca n't keep our population safe . 
  but of course our current administration likes to sit on it 's ass and take credit for things it had nothing to do with while blaming all the bad stuff on others and as a special fuck you to the people ca n't even be bothered to fund police forces properly to get convictions in the meantime . 
  conservative governance at it 's best . 
   i was once in 6 band for trail hardcore hiking enthusiasts will go to any length for trail . 
  these people are n't `` poor '' ( that certainly does n't mean the same thing as elsewhere ) because we do n't have the money to spend on them , these people are `` poor '' because the majority of the population is unwilling to provide anything more than what is required for a civilised life . 
  not entirely , there are some very small third parties in new england with representation in state legislatures , but the majorities are d and r . it depends on the pressure the local population can put on those state politicians who are traditionally much more concerned about what people think as spending is much less in those campaigns . 
  an example of pressure like this is the [ national popular vote interstate compact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_popular_vote_interstate_compact ) which while not abandoning the two-party system would make it easier not to discount third party or independent candidates as much as currently . 
  another one is [ wolf pac ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolf_pac ) which would outlaw private campaign financing and passed even in missouri which at the time had two chambers of the legislature controlled by republicans . 
  it is highly doubtful that grand change such as a conversion from a presidential to parliamentary democracy will happen in one swoop , but one single reform that congress is against would start an avalanche of activism . 
  if you go into any / r/worldnews thread when an election takes place somewhere in europe it is full of americans asking very detailed questions about the electoral system so there definitely is interrest but people are n't quite sure yet where to go just yet .

  and that makes a lot of people very very angry at the status quo and the people who represent it . 
  that study ignored far-right , left-wing , tv and online media . 
  basically somebody found that media that agreed with the government focused on the government message . 
  that 's not ideal , but it is n't suprising either . 
  the only thing i can come up with is renaming the country . 
  there 's a world of difference between between making up a few percentage points in some parts of the country and trying to get from 7 % -9 % of the vote to 50 % +1 seats in parliament . 
  or the states revolt and call a constitutional convention . 
  merkel swings to the left often enough for a lot of people to fall for the idea that she has any significant convictions . 
  hillary was always just a little to late not to piss off people . 
  people do n't vote based on averages and medians , they vote based on their personal experience of trying to earn a living . 
  the inactiveness of the us government has let to a large portion of the us populous slipping downwards in the class system , some even becoming impoverished and many deeply in debt . 
  because left-wing thought has been systematically suppressed since the 50s making libertarian and xenophobic analysis of `` the system '' the only alternative the greatest part of populous even knows are people who want to cut healthcare spending and preach the gospel of the free market at every chance . 
  what seems to us like insanity is to a lot of people the only other system they know outside of the status quo . 
  in this libertarian and neoliberal echochamber anybody who made it to be rich is by definition smart and as trump is rich that to a lot of people meant that he is right a priori . 
  the trump coalition was built out of those people , many on the far-right such as bannon and neo-nazis and fundamentalist christians who where willing to overlook trump 's promiscuity and outragous behaviour in the promise of more socially conservative policies ( against abortion , same-sex marriage , sex ed and so on ) mainly by making mike pence - fundamentalist galore - his vp pick . 
  these groups are now in constant conflict over influence in the white house which is one the reasons why the white house policies look so incoherent . 
  then there 's also those people who hate politicians in general and who got more excited the more trump violated standards of conduct . 
  the elections system being shit ( 4 out last 5 presidential elections where won in the popular vote by democrats but out of those 20 years america will see a republican president for 12 years ) had a role , but it was minor . 
  good , if you also can agree that at least attempts at this happen in almost every country around the world ( wherever it is economically possible to get people from countries with lower wages ) are made you essentially agree with / u/walrup . 
  are you willing to admit that immigration can significantly harm those who are payed low wages to work in jobs without much qualification by suppressing the wages of native workers or simply substituting them with immigrant workers * and * on the flipside that the increased profits and bonuses payed out to business owners and managers can ( and in practice are most certainly ) used on political spending ? 
  please answer in a simple `` yes '' or `` no '' before i have to read through another paragraph of neoliberal relativisation and dogma . 
   you are incorrect if you are talking about labor as a whole . 
  how often do i have to write low wage for you to get it ?
