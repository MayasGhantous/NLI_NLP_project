but that would suggest that the spd would have a say in that . 
  cdu decides . 
  ( merkel ) you see ? 
  i can provoke you as well with a simple statement . 
  if you think its an good idea to invite everyone to our country without even having an plan how to deal with them -  feel free to do so . 
  and yes i vote ** and ** `` bitch around '' at the same time . 
  but if you just simply say that i am a nazi then thats totally fine if it fits your big picture . 
  makes it easier does n't it ? 
  just like voting every 4 years and then go to sleep ? 
  am i not allowed to discuss and vote ? 
  i would n't event know how to answer the original question . 
  is it manageable ? 
  nobody , not even the politicans know what will happen . 
  do we accept every syrian ? 
  do we really send the people back we decline ? 
  what number are we really facing ? 
  what about next year ? 
  where do they live ? 
  how will they learn our language ? 
  how can they proof their qualification if there are no documents or they are n't approved because of different standards ? 
  we do they live ? 
  ( i mean really live , longterm ? ), 
  i would say that we could manage the current situation but i would also say that we should n't let anymore people in . 
  besides all that refugee discussion we have to keep in mind that these are just symptoms we are dealing with . 
  the source of the problem still remains . 
  thank you kind sir . 
  the numbers might be perfectly accurate as you mentioned . 
  that does n't change the fact the people were asked if germany could ** manage ** to deal with all that refugees . 
  thats not the same question as `` do you ** want ** to accept more refugees ? '', 
  but some of the media and people on reddit interpreted it that way . 
  and also keep in mind that at least `` politbarometer '' only calls people on landline . 
  they never call people on their mobile phone . 
  but many young people only use mobile phones and does n't even have a landline connection . 
  which is also an influence on the outcome edit : and yes , the wind turbine thing is kind of retarded but its also retarded to have no discussion about such a large amount of refugees which will influence our country for years to come . 
  but its questionable if it stays like that , because something like that never really happend before . 
  at least not in a gloablized world of today . 
  and similar scenarios like ww2 are not really comparable because the world changed to much . 
  have fun ** not ** controlling european borders . 
  thats something which to a large amount defines a country . 
  i know that its difficult but thats no reason not to do it . 
  like i said , it would help a lot if people could be `` processed '' in their camp near their homeland . 
  that would pervent thousand of people walking through the borders to begin with . 
  i do n't think that it will be useful to continue our discussion . 
  you think that the problems are not that serve as i think they are . 
  maybe you are more optimistic and more faithful towards our politicans . 
  we simply have to wait and see what happens . 
  but these are my biggest concerns . 
  what if like almost all of africa and syria ( middle east ) is walking towards europe . 
  or even just a small procentage ? 
  they know that we would accept them . 
  if we send them back it would also cause a lot of problems and we might not able to do that . 
  we should really control our european borders an `` process '' them right there . 
  there is also the possibility that is fighters walk right into europe . 
  in addition to those people who return from there if we keep doing it the way we do right now , then i think that we already lost control . 
  and that might be at the beginning of the problem . 
  look at the picture . 
  the newest poll says it 's 54/41 i never said that humantiy relies on polls . 
  i just simply said that it might not be true that every german wants to shelter those refugees like merkel and some news wants it to be . 
  which was also my first comment , because someone said `` the germans want them '' i want to help them as well , but it might not be a unique problem . 
  if we talk about the question of how many people we are able to take in , then waht about that in 5 years ? 
  we need a longterm and european solution and no solo campaign in which we take in all the refugees at once . 
  but there is also war and slaughter in africa . 
  i do n't see so much difference between some african countries and syria . 
  i do n't know if i will ever see german police that forces `` refugees '' into a plane back home . 
  and if they sold everything at home and got nothing left ? 
  i bet there will be a lot violence if they should get send back . 
  they could try everything legal or illegal to stay . 
  the have nothing to lose . 
  edit : i also do n't know if there country of origin takes them back so easily . 
  they might have no passports . 
  but i still have n't seen the poll . 
  it also depends on the question . 
  i have only seen one poll ( poltikbarometer ) where they asked if germany could ** handle ** all those refugees or not ? 
  the result was almost 50/50 based on that they wrote how the germans ** want ** or do n't want to shelter refugees . 
  but that is n't the same question . 
  i could say that i want to shelter them but also say that i do n't think that germany could handle them [ example !, 
  are they really going to send those people back ? 
  how do you send back so many people every year ? 
  where to exactly ? 
  it wo n't be so easy for them to return to their home if isis is right around the corner . 
  many of them sold everything so they could travel to europe . 
  if they are getting told to go back will they just say : '' hmm , okay at least i tried . 
  good bye '' and leave ? 
  this will be a massive problem . 
  and if eveyone from syria is getting accepted what is holding back all the africans from doing the same ? 
  i know that i ca n't prove that . 
  nobody can really say what a whole country wants . 
  sometimes there is n't even a majority opinion . 
  but just from watching the news and reading the latest news i feel like it 's not that simple like merkel wants it to be . 
  1 - what poll ? 
  just in adavance i do n't care about some poll from zdf or ard where only some 1000 people are getting asked . 
  2 - you ca n't just go around in east germany and tell those small towns that they have to provide shelter for like 20 % of their towns population and let them pay for everything . 
  what is going to happen if it gets cold in the winter ? 
  will they freeze to death in their tents ? 
  but they ca n't just build homes for them in time . 
  the refugees are just getting dumped there without asking about the important question like shelter and necessary supply . 
  in addition to that i have to say that it wo n't be helpful to put those refugees into areas where even the people already living there have trouble finding a job if the staate tries to build some wind turbine near some town during the energy transition the people are getting asked about there opinion . 
  now merkel simply forces us to take 1 million refugees without asking ? 
  thats not how democracy should be . 
  there is more to it than to vote every 4 years .
