fucked is a bit of a wrong word . 
  the video certainly targets the right side and them attacking refugees and yelling `` we are the people ! '', 
  and not the left wing . 
  but the left wing is practically just as bad as the right wing . 
  probably a bit more subtle , but as pragmatist . 
  we need those sides , yelling , though . 
  as long as they are at 5-15 % or similar , because they yell , the middle has to listen and take things as a signal . 
   at the same time they get to decide who is a true german and who is not the issue is more that it is quite effective populism if a lynch mob of `` germans '' attacks crying children and yells `` we are the people ! '' . 
  the video is saying , no you are not . 
  they are not . 
  they are a tiny minority , a movement . 
  an `` issue '' germany deals with all the time . 
  especially in east germany . 
   this sound eerily similar to what hitler did . 
  that is the intentional parody part . 
  that is what makes this video so confrontational and gave it so much exposure . 
  it creates a stark contrast to the topics ( vegan sausages ) and birckenstock sandals to that rammstein style music . 
  but yeah , the video directly mocks the right wing . 
  the left wing never claimed `` we are the people '' , it 's just very important to make sure that extremists do n't get to pretend they are representative for germans . 
  this video is a bit like what erdogan should be doing after every islamist attack . 
  of course that would almost be martyrdom . 
  and the things this video lists are so clearly german these days . 
  some of them are a bit more mocking to make you laugh ( vegan sausages ) but that vegetarian movement is everywhere in germany currently . 
  actually it is making fun of ourselves in a proud way . 
  wearing bicycle helmets is so hilariously german , for instance . 
  did you know the footage of the german mob holding out a bus with refugees ? 
  a german police man then tore out a crying child in a rather rough way ( allegedly he was trying to protect him from the lynch mob ) . 
  it was a disgrace not only for germans but for humanity . 
  that 's pretty much the same pictures in the start of the video , it 's a direct copy and sets the tone for the entire video . 
  i have to take some blame , though . 
  it 's sort of enough to watch the first 2-5 minutes of him speaking to get the message . 
  at that point , it is just an opinion . 
  but i was really shocked to notice the * exact * same effect that you are currently describing . 
  i was always shrugging these things of , but now i wonder ( and how could we be sure , it is just an opinion ) if that could be a more fundamental root issue . 
  i am really glad we have people like that that can make you think . 
  i hope you are being sarcastic . 
  we seem to agree with everything then ? 
  please do n't complain about the votes you do or do not receive, 
  yes . 
  about at least half of them outright are . 
  you may have just gotten unlucky . 
  to be precise , you are a pigeon that plays chess . 
  * woosh *, 
   why not mention holland or belgium ? 
  now you are just trying to argue . 
   were they not part of it ? 
  that is a straw man and i will not indulge this  because they were too small ? 
  try to hide your political correctness next time . 
  cheers . 
  weird , i can not seem to find the `` were you a member of the npd '' tickbox inside their [ application form ] ( https://www.alternativefuer.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/03/afd_aufnahmeantrag_formular.pdf ) . 
  who says about who is defeated or why things got ended ? 
  haffner is arguing * why things started * . 
  predestination . 
  * again * , i urge anyone to take this with a grain of salt . 
  but if you are surrounded by france , england , austria-hungary , russia , turkey , italy * to all sides * , you kind of have no choice but to muster for battle . 
  ok , so i can not be proud that my siblings are doctors and lawyers ? 
  agree to disagree . 
  have another upvote ... 
  says `` sure nobody likes a cult vibe '' . 
  proceeds to generate a cult vibe . 
  there is a great german historian called sebastian haffner ( you have to read his books with a great grain of salt ) and his one book `` von bismarck zu hitler '' . 
  in that book he states that preussia was pre-destined to multiple world wars , being surrounded by super powers on a geographic level ? 
  you have not watched the video . 
  watch the video . 
  or do n't . 
  the video explains all your questions . 
  did you see [ the other reply ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4cpe94/be_deutsch_achtung_germans_on_the_rise_from_the/d1kezmv ) , though ? 
  some hick-ups lead to some nice humor ( :, 
  i currently picture you asking my parents if they are proud that i committed apostasy . 
  i personally do n't like that it almost feels like a cult . 
  to each his own . 
  lol, 
  you are an individual and as such you are beautiful . 
   and i am not insulting it , i am stating i feel it 's kind of dumb . 
  and then i apologize for potentially stepping on any toes with that , which i apparently did to you . 
  i was genuinely asking . 
  and i personally find it `` dumb '' to say things , you think might offend others and then to say `` sorry '' or `` i mean no offense '' . 
   touchy , are we ? 
  because i claimed that you are not sorry * for saying `` dumb '' * ? 
  are you sorry * for saying that * ? 
  thanks , i edited my post, 
  de maiziere is an absolute pragmatist and retard that speaks before he thinks . 
  if you really want to know , why i believe what i believe , [ listen to this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br1qnbapymi ) . 
   supporting refugees has ** nothing ** to do with being pc . 
  that is incorrect . 
  it 's fair to say that it 's not the same thing . 
  but being pc has * very much * to do with journalism and the current european crisis . 
  i support refugees because it is the right thing to do . 
  we are * still * dropping the ball . 
  we are not putting enough effort in how we argue with the opposition . 
  we are pretending that we should decide what kind of news are being made . 
  we are pretending that it can be good if the government is not being transparent about things . 
  and we are not doing that because the states in germany own the media ( like 2 comment threads in this post suggest !, 
  ) , but because we - the people - are dropping the ball . 
  i do n't think we can fundamentally change a lot of things , but journalism is an exception to that . 
  i 've read at least spiegel taking responsibility for the topic touched in the video and i would call them representative for german `` elite '' ( please watch the video ) journalism . 
  but again , if you are making absolute statements like ` x ` has * nothing * to do with ` y ` on very complex and complicated topics , you would be surprised how often you will make a false statement . 
  i 'll even grant you that i am overstating how rampant `` pc '' has become in european journalism . 
  at least the guy in the video agrees with me . 
  we do n't have to agree with things , just because that is johannes rau 's opinion , though .
