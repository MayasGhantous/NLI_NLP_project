  donald trump would enter the fucking history books as one of the most celebrated humans on this planet . 
  do n't get me wrong , but many people feel like the meddling of the us in regions that should be of no concern for them is making things * worse * . 
   poutine is that some form of play on words ? 
  poutine , this reads a lot llke the german `` pute '' , which is a turkey hen . 
  so putin = turkey confirmed ? 
  who * claims * climate change is fictional . 
  huge difference . 
  i despise populists and pragmatists , but for once i am happy he just said what some people wanted to hear . 
  shit , i forgot for a moment about him . 
  you just depressed me :( shit it will be so important that europeans go vote when they get the chance in the future * and it will not at all matter what they vote for * . 
  i heard he is going to play the next james bond . 
  too far ? 
  was that taking it too far ? 
  he was just saying what the people wanted to hear . 
  if he does not want to , he will not unnecessarily upset humanity anymore . 
  maybe try not to turn every topic into a joke . 
  maybe you are being a little unreasonable here ? 
  our german media is very good in making a villain out of trump and putin . 
  they are not good people , but it 's not angels vs. demons . 
  do n't get me wrong , but in germany everyone has been brainwashed when it came to trump . 
  the big problem about the election coverage is , you had no other means of getting context . 
  you just had whatever clinton `` propaganda '' ( propaganda was an exaggeration but honestly adequate ) spon touched this day or ndr reported on that day . 
  you do understand that your opinion is about other nation 's internal affairs ? 
  or let 's have a discussion about my opinion of how unfitting your life choices were . 
  since apparently my opinion over your internal affairs is worth as much as yours . 
  some opinions are just worth less , though . 
  than other opinions of course . 
  if dissenting opinions come across as so bitter to you , then yes . 
  the one making it personal is ironically you . 
  the entire substance of your comment is personal . 
  you are ignoring my point and asking me about my emotions and motives . 
  while i grant that it is fair you would say `` i am at a loss of words '' is ` acting offended ' , you are free to argue the point i brought up , instead of * making it personal * when it was n't . 
  let 's get back to my point . 
  the one where leaving and having a voice in the future course of europe are mutually exclusive . 
  you can still try to have any kind of relationship with the united states of europe that you wish . 
  but you have no authority anymore to tell the rest of europe what kind of direction they should head towards . 
  you have no influence over this either . 
  frankly , you are not even entitled to an opinion over this any more . 
  you had your voice , and you spectacularly made a point that you no longer want to be heard . 
  hmm did not notice the parts about headlines , yet . 
  i guess in the end , it 's just unavoidable . 
  ` personally ' ? 
  i am at a loss of words . 
  we do n't . 
  we want unity . 
  you do n't . 
  you are free to leave . 
  what direction the rest of europe goes is no longer any of your business . 
  ** edit ** on a second note , i will just add you to the ignore list . 
  you may have the last word here , i honestly do n't care . 
  you want to go argue reddiquette with me ? 
  when you repeat your comments pointlessly , you are making comments ** that lack substance ** . 
  that 's just like writing phrases such as `` this '' , `` lol '' , and `` i came here to say this '' that are not witty , original , or funny , and do not add anything to the discussion . 
  when readers end up reading the same shit you write again , it 's the same thing . 
  i am not making a judgment on the quality of your posts . 
  i am making a judgment on your behavior on reddit . 
  you could have the best comment in the world , that still does not make it any less unsolicited if you flood your message across every top-level comment . 
  reddit is not a platform where you will win your petty arguments ad nauseam . 
  by just talking more and louder than the rest . 
  so you are against a federal europe with britain it . 
  but you are even against a federal europe without britain in it ? 
  ( sorry , i am sure i must be misunderstanding ), 
  that is a long way to write `` no '' to my third sentence . 
  look , you think trading between the eu and britain , it 's like a handshake . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's more like writing a book . 
  a huge book . 
  in fact , it 's like writing dozens of books . 
  those books contain many rules . 
  both sides agree to abide by the rules . 
  so now you think , all we have to do is a hand-shake and things will be back to avoiding `` the impact of the loss of i am so big market '' . 
  that 's not the case . 
  it 's just not . 
  we can handshake and pretend things are back to normal . 
  but they just are n't . 
  you are like `` let 's just write all those books again !, 
  but this time the way we like it '' . 
  and we will just give you the most british reaction to that any brit has seen on this planet . 
  that is not a repost . 
  do you happen to know what a repost is ? 
  a post , in reddit terms , is either a so-called ** link ** ( submission ) or ** text post ** ( submission ) . 
  this is about one person bringing up a topic and then ** another person ** bringing up the same topic again . 
  it 's not about responding with the same identical reply three times . 
  that is not a repost .

  the funny thing is when people argue that because ` x ` is so big , a deal has to happen . 
  it does n't . 
  we could n't work out our differences when we were both trying to work together . 
  now each side must be selfish . 
  that 's just how it is . 
  the path is way more rocky , and it will end far more often in a simple `` no '' ( of course the polite pr version of it that countries like turkey received when they wanted to enter the eu ) . 
  i am all for unity myself . 
  but when it comes to britan , that ship has sailed . 
   do n't freak out , i 'm not making a grandiose political statement , i 'm only asking a question . 
  why are mainland europeans so agitated about brexit ? 
  did the vote signify to you that the uk unanimously said `` europe sux '' ? 
  if you want to see a one-sided and simple representation of why we do n't like it , watch jon oliver 's story on it .
