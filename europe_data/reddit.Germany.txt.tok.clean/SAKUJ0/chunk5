  while jon oliver is very easy to refute / dismiss , it does not happen a lot when brits try to defend the brexit . 
  they are playing hard into the fallacies he points out in that episode . 
  and in the end , it 's about few very loud politicians tricking the country . 
  sounds ... like bild to me . 
  imho bild is worse . 
  sun/mail are spreading a lot of falsehoods and are horribly offensive and biased . 
  bild is pretty much * only * spreading false-hoods though . 
  and the bild is ** very ** representative of what germans think on the street . 
  i love how the brits come in here , all proud over their bbc ( which is my favorite news portal too admittedly ) , but then go quote that ** 5 % ** number , as if it suddenly meant that mail had negligible impact on brits and english-speaking people around the world . 
  while bild is ( imho ) even worse , sun/mail can do far more damage . 
  only one adequate expression to describe this : lol, 
   if the uk leaving means we no longer blocking the prospect of a federal europe ( even though i 'm against a federal europe ) then so be it . 
  you are against a federal europe without britain in it ? 
  why do you even care at this point ? 
  i could n't hear you over all the daily mail links i receive on facebook . 
  judging by some of the replies here , i 'm not . 
  good reason to re-locate , to be honest - if this will still be possible even . 
  the brits will flock to the streets anyway , the first time they will have to apply for a french visa  i think some of the potential consequences have not quite clicked with them yet . 
  the roman empire was big too at one point . 
  now we call it italy . 
  you do understand that is because of a whole lot of trade agreements that made this very attractive for both parties ? 
  you do understand that your country decided it no longer needs those deals ? 
  you do understand that your politicians lied to you when they told you you can just re-negotiate equivalent deals ? 
  germany can sell somewhere else . 
  uk ca n't buy from anywhere else that simply . 
  let the door not hit you on your way out from the eu . 
  a lot of people in the eu were fed up enough with the stream of constant selfish non-sense your politicians uttered , anyway . 
  i am sure your super economy and mega banking will thrive just fine on their own . 
  why even argue ? 
  you do n't seem to need the eu !, 
  good bye !, 
   access to the world 's fourth or fifth largest economy this is a two-way-street . 
  you had all that , it was called the eu . 
  you decided you no longer need it . 
  because you did n't like all the regulations that come with it . 
  you did n't like the entry fee . 
  it 's not necessary to have this , and nobody is going to bend over backwards for the brits to be * in * anything anymore , no matter what . 
  i think you are underestimating a simple matter of scale here when you are trying going on a whirlwind courtship why the brits are so good the eu needs them . 
  next time , just brush your teeth . 
  this is so backwards , and just because you can argue better than me or / u/allwordsaremadeup does not give your opinions any more authority . 
  also , ** spare us your fucking condescension and sarcasm ** . 
  this is a place for political discussion , not one for you to make yourself feel better in your sea of bitterness . 
  that shit is why we are no longer on a talking basis with you . 
  some people sometimes are really glad about that . 
  good bye !, 
  you do n't have to reply to every comment . 
  being loud is not helping your point when you try to claim the sun and the mail are not representative . 
  right . 
  hitler , star wars * and * bsg . 
  i am starting to see patterns . 
  so against erdogan , they were basically born mortal enemies ( / s ) . 
  turkey lost their authority to throw around the word terrorism . 
  the shame about that is that pkk is as terrorist as it gets without religion . 
   why should i ban you ? 
  you have n't done anything ban-worthy . 
  the only rule-breaking is accusing me of being a troll , which would be a light personal attack . 
  but whatever ? 
  this is nothing two mods should discuss in public . 
  i just could n't believe my own eyes when i saw that you not only have that amount of karma but also mod this place . 
  my apologies that i started this discussion in public . 
  i noticed that you are a mod mid-reply . 
  ** edit ** i edited the parts out that were born from surprise that you are a mod . 
  as far as i 'm concerned that is nobody 's business . 
  ** edit 2 ** also i said my peace . 
  i really do n't care what any kind of responses will be . 
  either you take anything from my feedback . 
  or you do n't . 
  if you mark the modmail as read , no other mod will probably know . 
  we have way too many political subreddits as is . 
  and i spend too much time on them as is . 
  if you are not a troll , then two people accusing you of one should be a huge red flag to you . 
  when you reply ` honest question : have you ever been served by a woman in a burqa/niqab in a cafe ? 
  i highly doubt that . ', 
  it is not only condescending ( what the fuck would you know about who he has been served with ) ? 
  it 's the fourth comment from the top , and you are dismissing it from the start and try to ask rhetorical questions . 
  also , then you are even more condescending asking him why he even brings it up ? 
  *** because he wants to keep it that way *** . 
  this ban is towards all kind of religious symbols . 
  keep your political correctness somewhere else . 
   i 'm not empowering erdogan jesus fucking christ , so you are self-important *** and *** dense ? 
  i was not talking about you when i said people can empower a dictator . 
  the people that i was talking about , that empower a dictator , are the same people that you mentioned in your comment . 
  ` ctrl + f ` it , you only used the word `` people '' under one context , and you were not talking about yourself as `` people '' . 
  ** tl/dr ** you got upset without understanding any of the one point i was making `` people can be friendly , inviting * and * empower a rising dictator '' - how is there *** any *** room for confusion here ? 
  you are employing the logical fallacy that just because somebody is friendly and inviting he can not ( even unknowingly ) empower a dictator . 
  then you would not have just answered  you are missing the point . 
  i have no problems with the judgement itself . 
  that 's a picture-book bait . 
  it 's all good man . 
  take the small victory , you baited that long reply from me . 
  i just woke up and have a bit of a headache . 
  now go run under some bridge or something . 
   you mean the supporters in europe ? 
  what look , the look you give to them ? 
  yes , when my slightly offensive unclue yells again * all kurds are pkk !, 
  * , and my slightly kurdish unclue is sitting next to him , i start getting shocked and turn pale . 
  when people say erdogan only arrests terrorists right now and that all g\u00fclen fans deserve to be tortured and locked up with no current rights , i get really really shocked . 
   to organize volunteers to be present in voting places until the votes are counted and registered officially in order to maximize the fairness . 
  yeah i read that . 
  and spreading awareness about candidates , too .
