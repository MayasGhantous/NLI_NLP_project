  that i like a lot . 
   i know this reply is full of questions but ... what turkish facebook ? 
  :d some people can manipulate social media through legal and illegal means . 
  when i wrote `` turkish facebook '' i am just saying that turkey lives in their own bubble inside facebook . 
  you have not seen burkas before ? 
  ** edit ** sorry , i am not buying that . 
  i am seeing them at least once a week . 
  the refugee crisis should not have that different results for you and me . 
  if it does , let me know so i can call mutti and we will figure this out together . 
  nah , ** we ** are communicating . 
  ** you ** are trying to . 
  if you saw our faces right now , that would probably be obvious to you . 
  you should probably try a bit more of those face to face conversations . 
  i hear they make you sound less bitter . 
  are you trying to bait him ? 
  i am pretty sure kimonos have nothing to do with religion , but are just traditional clothing ( read : they are not in fashion these days ) . 
  that would fall entirely under dress code . 
  some employers might require you to wear that and others might forbid you . 
  of course i would not go to a western bar with live guitar where my server wore a kimono . 
  ( unless they were really fucking funny ) . 
  at least the store owners should get to choose . 
  sorry , but if i have western pub with live guitar , then i think the owner gets a say in how his bar tenders dress . 
  you can always work somewhere else . 
  honestly , i consider myself very tolerant . 
  but i certainly would not go to a cafe where people are served in burkas in the muslim country i grew up in or in germany . 
  he is literally mentioning it so the situation wo n't get `` worse '' for him . 
  your entire response is misguided . 
  nobody is saying no women should wear a hijab . 
  *** the entire discussion here is around the right for me as a cafe or restaurant owner to choose a person that wo n't wear a religious symbols like a hijab *** . 
  who the fuck do you think we are forbidding hijabs in public ? 
  turkey ? 
  you are the one here saying the tapa bar owner will not be able to do anything about his employers marrying and suddenly starting to wear a hijab . 
  in your , misguided world , i would actually employ the service people for my competition , and ruin their businesses , having the people wear burkas and awkwardly pray 5 times a day . 
  this is all under religious freedom right ? 
  allahim yarapim , you gavurs are sometimes really fucking dense when you think someone is politically incorrect . 
  even us muslims do n't want to fucking see a hijab everywhere we go . 
  at least enough of us do not . 
  it was a good thing for turkey to do . 
  i do n't want teachers teaching my kids , that are incapable of removing a hijab for 60 minutes . 
  that 's literally the end of it . 
   it must be harsh for you , being torn like that . 
  the discussions already get pretty heated with erdo an supporters in europe :( no matter how much i try to shut up , they will ask me why i gave them that look etc , it always escalates . 
  i do n't know oy ve \u00d6tesi . 
  i am always careful with vote promotion , though . 
  less participation could have avoided the situation we are in right now . 
  that being said , this time around i will go all * bannon * on turkey . 
  it 's not like akp is playing by the rules . 
  all bets are off now . 
  i will social engineer my own family and their best friends if i have to take over turkish facebook . 
  they do n't have to . 
  they control all the media and can lock away dissidents . 
  try talking to / r/turkey these days . 
   but do n't forget both countries are at least 95 % decent people that just make a living !!, 
  jesus christ , you visited side and now are giving us lectures . 
  this is the saddest bit of self-importance i have witnessed in a while . 
  stop drawing false equivalencies . 
  people can be friendly , inviting * and * empower a rising dictator . 
  go visit turkey . 
  i love the people there . 
  they are warm and nice . 
  but a lot of them ( my family included ) * are dense as fuck * . 
  think about half of turkey being hillbillies and rednecks . 
  his power right now entirely comes from the people . 
  it can still be gone . 
  but with him controlling media and dissidents , most hope is already lost . 
  the elections are not fair to this particular extent . 
  might that be how we remember erdo an one day ? 
  :( can we normalize 5000 by earth 's / the region 's population increase ? 
  it is `` fair '' . 
  ( the vote itself . 
  nothing surrounding the vote is ) turkey just has 50 % hillbillies and rednecks that scare me to an extent that i do not have it in me to visit my family there anymore . 
   my point is not that the french constitution is good or that the turkish reform is not a point of concern so far , your point is * somewhere * between those two extremes , though . 
  because most of our constitutions are not necessarily that and the turkish one * is * a point of concern . 
  you are like the guy that goes `` no my wedding photos are fine , i have a backup on this usb drive here '' - and then when checked you see that the usb drive is no longer working . 
  good effort - but just like a backup , we only know how truly good a constitution is if it fails or just bearly manages to do something . 
  you guys will be able to learn a lesson from turkey . 
  your thought process should be `` will we have to change * our * constitution , if so in what way ? 
  thanks erdo an '' . 
  you forget that 50 % of the people living in turkey are hillbillies and rednecks . 
  that number was actually improving . 
  people knew they could escape everything just by moving to another city . 
  turkish people could n't just leave the country before . 
  it 's heart-breaking , they were almost past the goal line . 
  now everything will be lost . 
  ah , of course . 
  the differences between speaking * literally * and speaking * figuratively * , 
  that video is not about 2 party votes . 
  have you even watched it ? 
  * any * vote that did n't go to trump was mathematically throwing your vote away , judging by your reasoning . 
  the fun part , ayran is literally just yogurt , a bit of water and a pinch of salt . 
  no , it 's literally nothing more . 
  all those turkish barbecues make home-made ayran , and just put a bit of water into yogurt and add salt . 
  i wish i was kidding but there is no secret to it . 
  the us has more than two parties , as well . 
  people voted for more than 2 presidents , too . 
  this is such a middle finger . 
  i love it . 
   calling an allied power nazis should honestly just be followed with sanctions by ~ ~ the eu . ~ ~ satan himself . 
  being a vegetarian is not a redeeming quality . 
  loving your kids or puppies are not necessarily either .
