  saying something is a redeeming quality already makes a judgment about comparativeness . 
   this would be a clear violation of his free speech rights . 
  why ? 
  these things are often illegal in germany . 
  free speech has no room next to our constitution when it directly contradicts our ideology . 
  since other states are involved , germany can not spread actual propaganda inside turkey , either . 
  in fact , german citizens that try to spread any controversial opinions are often being intimidated or worse . 
  if free speech leads to issues like that , then it nedds to be and it actually does end up being restricted . 
  to be fair , i still think that the eu expanded far too quickly under schr\u00f6der . 
  that being said , you are now us . 
  ideal values far outweigh practical ones . 
   so if you only work an hour a day , you 're as productive as if you worked eight hours ? 
  if you managed to * produce * exactly one eighth of what you would have produced in eight hours , you would be exactly as productive . 
  if you managed to do a quarter of what you would have produced in eight , you would be * twice as productive * - even though in total you produced ~ ~ more ~ ~ less . 
  i think this does not sound so ridiculous if you use the terminology as it is intended and defined in dictionaries and academia . 
  that being said , / u/low _ discrepancy - someone likely plagued by procrastination as much as i am - attacking you is quite uncalled-for . 
  he makes it sound like you guys working more is a bad thing . 
  it 's usually not . 
  the issue is that some families * have to work more * - like working two jobs . 
  and having their children still live at the poverty line . 
  that 's sadly why your average is a bit higher here . 
  well , op ( which i was finding harsh words to ) said ` median gdp ppp per capita ' . 
  of course the term ` median income ' makes a lot of sense . 
  median gdp * per capita * does not . 
  you would expect the income of a normal mississippi person to be quite a bit higher than the income in uk or sweden . 
  the usa is a world power ( with some rough edges ) . 
  there are lots of other correlations that explain this . 
  ( percentages are ballparks and guessed ) * they work something like ~ 20 % more * about 75 % of them pay health insurance which probably amounts to at least 5 % of their income * the usa is known to tax people less than the european counterparts . 
  i am not a native , but i believe income is minus tax ? 
  if that is the case , * the difference would be huge * . 
  ( i am genuinely asking you here ) . 
  it 's not unusual to tax a normal citizen 30 % -50 % of their salary in europe . 
  if you earn more , the percentage might easily be far higher . 
  i am saying that words matter , if someone is trying to make a biased point that is motivated politically and is sourced by clickbait articles . 
  on top of that , you see op mix up words in a way that shows he just picked that up and is not 100 % sure about the situation . 
  to be fair , neither am i. i could easily be wrong with many of my points raised , not because i am a dick or a retard . 
  but because i am genuinely ignorant and i do not see the entire picture . 
  i just happen to know about numbers a bit is all . 
  we all know exactly what you are talking about , once something * truly clicks * . 
  it is an oddly satisfying feeling . 
  well , we have been telling the swedes to get their shit together with how they assess that data for ages now . 
  it was only a matter of time until this is used against them . 
  ** edit ** just read the comments for fuck 's sake . 
  it 's all about how * liberals * are hypocrites and it 's just the right trying to make a point how ` any statistic can be misleading ' . 
  these 2 articles are what is wrong with the internet . 
  that 's because * it probably is a bit strange and contrived * . 
  mississippi had a gdp per capita of $ 32k and britain had a gdp per capita of  $ 40k during the last 2-3 years . 
  when an article like that says that mississippi - the poorest state of the us - has a higher gdp per capita than britain . 
  the first thing i do is look it up . 
  then i see their excuse in the second paragraph `` we should point out that this does n't mean that the median income in all us states is either higher or even equal to uk incomes . '', 
  and then i look back at the title ## britain is poorer than any us state : yes , even mississippi and then i think , you are a horrible person / u/landtank -- . 
  also gdp is * inherently a metric * that sums stuff up . 
  it is inherently incompatible with the concept of a median on a mathematical level . 
  when you sum stuff up , and divide in the end , you have an average . 
  calling it a `` median gdp per capita '' sounds like satire , even . 
  you sum shit up ? 
  you divide by the count ? 
  it 's an average . 
  it is , though . 
  just in this case it is a poor metric to speak for * every american * . 
  that 's because the wage distribution has little to do with a normal distribution . 
  i would not me surprised if the top few hundred people of the us alone make more money than the swedes . 
  you probably only need a handful of the richest americans . 
  you are wrong in * why * this is . 
  this is strictly the case of statistical outliers . 
  the average makes it sound like its relevant for every person in the usa . 
  but if the richest person in the usa alone * were to earn * more money than the entire country of sweden , then things would be really clear . 
  no you are not . 
  essentially there are two popular metrics for that kind of thing . 
  the mean or average is just the sum divided by the count . 
  this is the value to go for , if your distribution is close to the gaussian curve . 
  the number has a lot of meaning in that case . 
  it 's literally where an infant child would point to when asked `` where is it the biggest '' - it 's the tip of the mountain . 
  if you have outliers , though . 
  then this is no longer a gaussian curve . 
  say you go to a bar , how much money do people have in their wallets ? 
  * $ 10 * $ 10 * $ 30 * $ 100 * $ 10 000 so what 's the average ? 
  to calculate it , i can just pick the $ 10k , divide it by five and say * it 's at least $ 2k * . 
  but do those $ 2k represent the other four people in every way ? 
  no , because the distribution is not shaped like a gaussian curve . 
  this is where the * median * can be of use . 
  the median in this case would be $ 30 . 
  it means 50 % ( 2 ) have less than $ 30 and 50 % ( 2 ) have more than $ 30 . 
  that 's the extent of what it means and a 6 year old can do the same with that information as albert einstein . 
  with the mean , statisticians can do a lot of fancy stuff that . 
  that 's because it is basically described by a nice , arithmetic formula , which tends to appear in a lot of other fancy statistical formulas . 
  lol always . 
  i think we are just so upset because our room mate is leaving . 
  it will probably be a bit like a break-up/divorce now - as ridiculous as this sounds . 
  nobody wishes harm on the uk . 
  but yeah , things could be rough for a while for everyone involved and countries will put themselves first for now . 
  also i 'd be cautious with germany now , we will get what 's coming to us this year :( it 's our turn now and i am afraid people do not yet see this coming . 
  for crying out loud , there is almost no way less than 7 parties will be voted into parliament this term . 
  i do n't think anyone will * punish * anyone - nobody even can , but all those privileges an eu country has ( there is a reason turkey wanted in ) they are really complex . 
  there is no re-negotiating them in detail . 
  let 's hope they see it the way you do . 
  but that attitude ... the ball is in spain 's court ... is why the rest of the eu is * so * mad at you guys . 
  it should n't be to begin with . 
  is there a name for that root of languages or something ? 
  i was told it was something like a `` root language '' , where terms are cascaded and grammar composes different forms into pretty long words .
