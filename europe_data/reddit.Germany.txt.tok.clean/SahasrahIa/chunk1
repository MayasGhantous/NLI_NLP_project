not really . 
  most of the purple / pink areas are on the rhine river . 
  i like the \u00df !, 
  it 's special to german and also my hometown has it in it 's name . 
  i do n't mind standardized grammar per se , but the reform in it 's original form was awful . 
  they took some things back since then though . 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't know why it 's gone , but it was there when i sent the reply . 
  i 'm 27 . 
  started school in 1994 , two years before the reform . 
  -_- ' edit : so i basically learned both ways and now i often get confused . 
  germans did n't understand it is a joke and actually [ reformed it in 1996 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_orthography_reform_of_1996 ) . 
  now nobody knows how to spell properly anymore . 
  \u0141 is pronounced like a w ? 
  and w like f ? 
  man !, 
  how do do you pronounce \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ? 
  i just discovered we have a chipotle in frankfurt . 
  glorious !, 
  yeah , generally it 's cheap convenience food , but it depends heavily on where you get it i guess . 
  i heard really bad things about kebab in berlin , because the competition is so big . 
  in smaller cities it 's usually alright . 
  according to information obtained by spiegel online germany will introduce controls on it 's southern borders temporarily . 
  minister of the interior thomas de maizi\u00e8re is expected to make an announcement this afternoon . 
  as an reaction to the refugee crisis the federal goverment will introduce border controls and suspend the schengen agreement temporarily . 
  all federal policemen are called on standby . 
  the federal police has sent all available policemen to bavaria to close the borders . 
  ** update ** : they 've added some more information : minister of the interior thomas de maizi\u00e8re is going to hold a press conference at 5:30 pm . 
  from now on entry is only possibly with legal travelling documents . 
  according to de maizi\u00e8re the procedures are in accordance with schengen border codex and are needed to reintroduce order and safety . 
  the huge numbers of refugees are overstraining germanys capacities . 
  the federal government is trying to buy time . 
  the individual states ( bundesl\u00e4nder ) need some air , to handle the huge numbers logistically . 
  especially bavaria and north-rhine westfalia are hit by ten thousands of refugees . 
  it 's also supposed to be a signal to refugees not to rush to germany too fast . 
  one side will run out of people to kill eventually . 
  i 'm not a lawyer , so i do n't know what they do with people without documentation , but you have to prove you 're syrian to get refugee status . 
  no they ca n't in germany , not even their children that are born here are allowed to stay . 
  so were/are the balkans , they still kicked my bosnian friends out after three years . 
  they are not immigrants , they are refugees seeking asylum . 
  as soon as the situation in syria settles down most of them will have to leave . 
  i do n't understand why people never make that distinction , it 's very important . 
  * my condolences . 
  she wo n't legalize weed . 
  the mosque in [ cologne ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cologne_central_mosque ) also has an interesting modern design . 
  now someone do a franconian version . 
  let 's tear this place down together, 
  german politicians are crooks too and the people do n't do anything about it either . 
  like schr\u00f6der who was chancellor before merkel : when he went out office he got a nice position at gazprom . 
  germans are hypocrits . 
  no , you actually have it backwards . 
  the economy of a nation does not work like the economy of a business or your private household . 
  in an economic crisis a nation actually wants to * spend * money ( i.e. 
  make debt ) to get out of the crisis . 
  when the economy is running on it 's own again , the nation can start paying back the debt . 
  because a running economy generates taxes and keeps the people in work . 
  this is actually what germany did when the financial crisis hit : they * paid * the people to scrap their old cars and then buy new ones - kept the automobile industry from collapsing which is vital to the nation . 
  or they spent money on public infrastructue , schools etc. 
  so all the small and medium businesses still had work while nobody wanted to make investments . 
  it 's easy to grow when a lot of the people do n't even have a pot to piss in and are willing to work for a fraction of the money . 
  personally i do n't want india 's growth . 
  nope , he thought of himself as a [ `` cultural christian '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_behring_breivik#christianity ) . 
  i did n't say that , but the fundament of the eu is an economical union . 
  it started out as the [ eec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_community ) , the euro was one of it 's biggest projects . 
  on the other hand , we do n't have a minister of foreign affairs . 
   the eu is fundamentally a political entity and not an economic entity . 
  now that 's just plain wrong . 
  [ more like 85 + years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wall_street_crash_of_1929 ), 
  banksters and [ corrupt politicians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ) trying to divide the good people of europe . 
  greece should 've defaulted and the banks should 've taken the loss . 
  i hope the greek stay in europe , we used to have a [ great friendship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philhellenism ) with them . 
  sound like the beginning of gothic 1 ( game for pc ) . 
  do you have any proof of that ? 
  it 's true . 
  merkel and her party were against turkey joining before the decline of democracy and now they are for it because of the refugee deal . 
  hypocrites !, 
  it actually was sort of . 
  they were able to remove people : [ lenin picture with trotzky ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/redsqlenintrotsky.jpg ) [ lenin picture without trotzky ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/lenin_addressing_the_troops_-_may_5_1920_-_altered.jpg ) [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_of_images_in_the_soviet_union ) with more pictures . 
  now it 's perfect . 
  great work !, 
  i really like it !, 
  even the sidebar , but i would n't mind it either , if it was moved to the top . 
  i also agree that the snoo + text in the comment box should be transparent . 
  please keep the style of the comment tree with it 's different shades of grey , that 's very reading friendly . 
  [ heinz-christian strache ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinz-christian_strache ) , chairman of the right-wing [ fp\u00d6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_party_of_austria ), 
  on a tuesday too . 
  three states vote in the primaries today . 
  not many , two were killed with bombs in their cars . 
  looking at [ this map ] ( https://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2016-03-13-lt-de-st/charts/index-umap/umap_2692.png ) it seems to me that sachsen-anhalt is a bit divided on afd support . 
  maybe some of the nothern districts were faster in turning the results in . 
  it 's against the rules of the house ( schulz cites the article ) which everyone agreed upon . 
  if he ca n't respect the rules he has to go . 
  everyone agreed to the rules . 
  this guy is disturbing the peace of the parliament and thus makes working impossible . 
  enough will survive . 
  it 's not like we have all the books and documents from ancient times or the middle age . 
  just think about how many libraries were destructed , like the library in alexandria . 
  still we know so much , it 's incredible . 
  good point . 
  also great source for future historians .
