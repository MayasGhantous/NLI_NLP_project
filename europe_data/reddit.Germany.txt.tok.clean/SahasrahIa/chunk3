  also gyros , olives and cheese . 
  italy : you have the best food in europe !, 
  also thanks for art and culture . 
  britain : love your humour , mates !, 
  the queen seems like a nice lady . 
  france : you 've got the most beautiful capital and your history is very interesting . 
  sweden : you guys seem alright !, 
  thanks for ikea . 
  amsterdam is a beautiful city and should be visitied for sightseeing and not ( only ) to smoke . 
  also the dutch have the cutest litte houses . 
  it 's not true . 
  resentment against jews have been constant the past years at around 15-20 % ( meaning these people have some views that could be considered antisemitic ) in germany . 
  only have a german [ source ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/nahost-und-antisemitismus-explosion-der-judenfeindschaft-das-geht-an-der-realitaet-vorbei/10254532.html ) for this , sorry . 
  it 's like this in germany : the moderate right / conservatives mostly view themselves as friends of israel and are against muslim immigration . 
  the far right / neonazis hate everyone who is n't german/european or `` aryan '' . 
  a lot of rightwingers do n't talk about jews though in order to appear to be moderate albeit being the latter in reality . 
  germany had the rote armee fraktion ( raf ) in the 1970s and nationalsozialistischer untergrund ( nsu ) in the 2000s . 
  easter is the first full moon on or after the march equinox . 
  germans are more than upset about this . 
  we 're shocked and angry . 
  just not as angry as reddit wants us to be , i.e. 
  violent against all foreigners . 
  remember that not the government budget is paying for state police . 
  k\u00f6ln police comes out of the nrw state budget which is n't in a good shape . 
   not just politicians , but too many people think security is simply a natural state of affairs in the first world , and any money spent on security is just wasted . 
  depends on the kind of security . 
  i think tracking everyones phones and online activities is against my civil rights and completely useless on top as we have seen : paris could n't stop the terrorists albeit cranking up the surveillance of their citizens . 
  i am however very much in favor of having more and better trained police officers in the street . 
  especially on events like nye in big cities . 
  you have thousands of drunk people handling explosives in a city of 1 million people and there are only a few hundred officers ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  imo berlin is very safe compared to other big cities in europe . 
  sarrazin [ is a racist ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/thilo_sarrazin#eugenik_und_biologisierung_des_sozialen ) in the strictest meaning of the word . 
  [ he actually thinks there are different races of humans with jews having their own special jew gene . 
  nice , quoting sarrazin . . 
  they are all very good papers ( at least the printed versions , i 'm not too fond of spiegel online ) . 
  faz is conservative and sdz center-liberal . 
  you misunderstood me . 
  at least in germany race or * rasse * still has one specific meaning : that there is a fundamental biological difference between * arier * , aryans , who are superior and non-aryan people , like jews , slavs or negroes , who are inferior . 
  so using the word * rasse * to describe the difference between people is very much frowned upon . 
  i understand that in the usa many people do n't believe in the concept of race anymore either and still use the word , but with the broader meaning you described . 
  so you use old terms , that used to have a specific meaning , for something else now . 
  i do n't agree with this and i think there are enough words , for example ethnicity , that are less loaded . 
   i also do n't understand why they call all white people caucasians no matter their actual ethnicity . 
  that 's because they still think in matters of * race * which irritates me to no end . 
   forbidding hitlers mein kampf mein kampf is not explicitly banned in germany !, 
  it is a copyrighted work and after world war 2 the state of bavaria inherited all belongings of adolf hitler including the rights to mein kampf , because his last place of residence was m\u00fcnchen . 
  they decided not to re-release the book . 
  you can still buy and sell old prints . 
  the copyright will run out on december 31th of this year , because it 's been 70 years since hitler died . 
  the ifz ( instituts f\u00fcr zeitgeschichte ) is preparing a commented print for release early next year . 
  they even tweet in english . . `` those seeking #asylum in #europe must apply for asylum in the first country of entry to the #europeanunion . 
  #refugees #dublinrules #eu '' https://twitter.com/germanydiplo/status/641575898001580032 `` chancellor #merkel : #europe as a whole has to be a safe for #refugees . 
  but there is no right to choose a specific country to stay in . '', 
  https://twitter.com/germanydiplo/status/643802139110842368 `` human traffickers lie and are only interested in money . 
  they do n't help , they put your life at risk . 
  do n't trust them !, 
  #refugees '' https://twitter.com/germanydiplo/status/641618470946349057, 
  lord have mercy on us all . 
  that 's not true . 
  germany even sent people to the refugee camps to battle the spreading of misinformation . 
  `` world media '' just does n't like to report these things widely , because then they would have to admit that their earlier reports were false . 
  you think smugglers need to take a merkel quote out of context for their pitches ? 
  the other day they interviewed syrians on german tv and they said that smugglers told them that in germany every syrian gets a house , a job and 3000 $ ( or something ) welcome money . 
  smugglers just make shit up , they do n't need merkel . 
  and people in a war zone apparently are desperate enough to believe this nonsense . 
   it 's like people are just desperate to portray them as nazis . 
  the rhetorical style of goebbels ' speeches was n't the problem , it was the actual content and context . 
  yes and h\u00f6cke is saying very similar things as goebbels aswell , he 's using some of the same words . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q--dtvaso9y ) ( video in german )  also except for the climate-change point ( which you are n't even sure of ) , all those other points are perfectly reasonable stances and opinions to have . 
  you might not agree with them , but it 's absolutely nothing someone should feel ashamed about . 
  it 's just a different opinion . 
  that 's the offical party line for now . 
  h\u00f6cke cleary goes beyond this and is not hiding it . 
  afd wants to * abolish the euro and reintroduce national currencies * abolish tax breaks for green energy * abolish minimum wage * abolish schengen ( not sure on that one , at least they want to reintroduce border controls ) * asylum applications decided within 48h * no asylum applications from safe countries allowed ( so people from the balkans ca n't even submit one ) * they do n't believe in man-made climate change or something ? 
  [ source ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_f%c3%bcr_deutschland#inhaltliches_profil ) one of their most prominent members , bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke , has given speeches in the exact style of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister , lately . 
  same rhetoric , same way of speaking . 
  this party has been drifting in that direction since the split within their members . 
  they might become the new [ npd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democratic_party_of_germany ) now , just that they wear suits instead of combat boots and flight jackets . 
  it 's not that simple though . 
  you have to consider the situation . 
  there was a lot of tension between serbia and austria-hungria before this mess . 
  for serbia letting austrians into their country to conduct an independent investigation was like giving up their sovereignty to their enemy . 
  austra * knew * the serbs could n't give into their demands and that it would mean war . 
  but that 's just those two , a quick war between austria and serbia would n't have been too horrible yet . 
  russia could 've said : sorry serbs , you 're our serv brothers , but you made your bed , now lay in it . 
  but nope , they declared war on austria . 
  at that point germany could n't back down either , they had to help their austrian brothers . 
  but germany did n't do nothing to calm down the russians before it got to that point . 
  kaiser wilhelm was the cousin of the tsars wife , he could 've reached out . 
  they were all set on war !, 
  and when germany went through belgium to attack france , great britain did n't have much choice either . 
  i agree . 
  look at how old most people in the pegida movement are . 
  most of them were still socialized in east germany , at least their childhood was spent there . 
  you 're getting downvoted , but historians nowadays usually moved away from `` germany started ww1 '' . 
  there 's a strong argument that the serbian government was involved with the terrorists that killed franz ferdinand . 
  would n't say they started it though , austria made ridiculous demands after it and did n't give serbia much time to respond . 
  i think it 's fair to say all parties involved did their part in escalating the situation . 
  i recommend reading `` the sleepwalkers : how europe went to war in 1914 '' by christopher clark .
