  still not a good reason to be proud of it . 
  also the german empire only lasted 47 years . 
  i think most germany still define themselves by the region they are from , i.e. 
  verfassungsschutz ( domestic security agency ) could do that . 
  they are having difficulties with their right eye lately though . 
  bankers . 
  if you can make it into their gated communities . 
  [ these ? 
  ] ( http://www.aif.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_schokokuss_606585_web_birgith_pixelio.de_c89ebc810b.jpg ) they were called mohrenkopf ( negro head ) or negerkuss ( nigger kiss ) in germany when i was a child . 
  do not cheer him just because he is n't merkel . 
  sch\u00e4uble is amongst the [ biggest crooks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ) post-war german politics has seen . 
  i do n't believe merkel will give up her power just yet though . 
  seehofers threats are empty anyway , he ca n't compete against the cdu on a federal level . 
  yes , but the dw is n't funded with the rundfunkbeitrag , it comes out of the [ budget of the government ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_welle#finanzierung ) . 
  and not just * a * german website , deutsche welle is tax funded . 
   he has nothing to do with pegida or any other political group [ there is some new information on this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/henriette-reker-taeter-frank-s-hat-rechtsextreme-vergangenheit-a-1058337.html ) , i 'll say let 's wait before we judge the situation . 
  `` police in the german city of cologne confirmed on saturday that the earlier knife attack against mayoral candidate henriette reker was indeed motivated by anger at her pro-refugee stance . 
  the 58-year-old reker , an independent , was stabbed and seriously injured while visiting an outdoor market on the campaign trail . '', 
  no , they just have a huge empty office complex in town and germany is in desperate need to get the refugees out of tents as the first snow has started to fall in some places . 
   merkel would be far too early ; it 's still mid-cricis . 
  if the immediate crisis is resolved in the next few months , she 'd be a strong contender in a year or two . 
  also the nominations ended in february , the refugee crisis had just started . 
  she was nominated for aiding the peace talks in ukraine . 
  so yeah , maybe next year . 
  ~ 400-500 $ rent ( if alone , less per person in families ) + 100 $ health insurance + 390 $ cash + whatever a language course costs ? 
  that gets you to 800-1200 $ per head easily . 
  police chief ~ ~ wiggum ~ ~ wendt again . 
  he sure is getting quite popular on / r/europe . 
  i was talking about the personalausweis . 
  no , fortunately only personal data and a biometric photo so far , fingerprints are optional . 
  for medical data we have a different card ( from the insurance company ) . 
  thats for those waiting on their application to get processed . 
  i think / u/bristlerider 's numbers are for refugees that already got theirs granted . 
  germany too . 
   merkel had more than 1 month time to correct her statements but as always , she remained silent . 
  [ she 's not silent . 
  i do n't believe it either , but de maizi\u00e8re could do it . 
   no tolerance for intolerance or violence i 'd say this covers it . 
  latin ? 
  the old testament was written in hebrew and the new testament in greek . 
  i 'm just saying that we have n't been a nation state for all that long and the differences in the states in culture and religion are quite big . 
  for example bavarians are culturally closer to austrians than to hessians . 
  i think that is why we are still so hung up on recent history , because that 's what we actually do have in common and derive our values from . 
  germany does n't even have a unified culture . 
  probably , merkel cares about polls . 
  i misunderstood you then . 
  yeah i agree , regarding the migrants it 's out of hand now anyway . 
  i do n't think the misinformation on reddit is aimed at migrants though , but to radicalise the people opposed to it . 
  justified criticism is turning more and more into blind hate . 
  are n't the neue rechte like the guys on the politically incorrect blog , who are pro-us , pro-israel and anti-muslim ? 
  but yeah , we also have pro-russia right wingers . 
  it 's getting confusing . 
  what has this to do with political correctness ? 
  the german government has n't invited anyone , people are making things up or twist words around like / u/sneakysnakex here . 
  i 've also seen articles with bad translations floating around , so of course it 's not always the users fault , but just trust me as a german who follows these events closely : there has n't been an open invitation to refugees by our government . 
  however , admittingly , disregarding the dublin agreement and letting refugees from hungary via austria into germany could be regarded as such . 
  fault merkel for that , not for things she has n't even said . 
   merkel is the one that said `` germany has room for 800,000 immigrants . '', 
  lol you people twist words around to fit your propaganda . 
  a minister said we expect 800,000 asylum requests this year . 
  they do that in every larger city in germany . 
  please . . 
  die welt is a paper for people too ashamed to read bild . 
  literally it says '' the dignity of humans is untouchable '', 
  i 'm living in a town of 75,000 people , everything is the usual . 
  only once saw some syrians on my way to the store the other day , they greeted me friendly and that was it . 
  lol my town is handling the situation very well and keeps the people informed on what 's going on . 
  latest news is that they 're now starting to build wooden houses to replace the tents . 
  last friday they also organized a football tournament between refugees teams and our local teams , everyone was invited . 
  that was nice . 
  i think we should support the wall , so americans do n't cross the border into the new eu-mexico to flee trump 's presidency . 
  seehofer could announce conditions for a coalition beforehand , like a change in the refugee policy or even merkel not being the chancellor . 
  it 's not very likely , but i do n't think it 's impossible to do . 
  i 've been musing about this the other day : yes , the voter base would split , but would n't a sizable amount of people , who are currently dissatisfied with the cdu but not enough to vote afd , flock to a new bundes-csu ? 
  might they not even be able to steal the afd some votes if seehofer ran as the csu 's candidate for chancellor ? 
  after the election they can still form a coalition , so no votes lost due to splitting the voter base . 
  maybe she upgraded bundeswehr weapons from flinten to kanonen . . 
  usually around midnight . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  it 's very hard to legally * immigrate * into germany . 
  the people that came here in the last 12 month came as refugees and asylum seekers , not immigrants . 
  also we 're talking about a regional election here . 
  not much the state of mecklenburg-vorpommern can do about merkels refugee policy . 
  yes , how dare i to think about hitler , when all you want is a strong authority figure who gets rid of all the semites !, 
  you know he does n't mean normal conservatives . . he means rightist extremists . 
   [ either way , we need some real authority with someone who does n't let feelings get in the way of its safety ] ( https://i1.wp.com/i1.gmx.net/image/554/30974554,pd=2,f=teaser-l/adolf-hitler.jpg ), 
   i would not trust these statistics . 
  before the regional elections in saxony-anhalt the afd was expected to receive ~ 15 % of the vote , they got 24,2 . 
  it 's hard to poll for a new party , because you have to guesstimate their demographics . 
   also , if you have a look at this article from die welt , in the comments the people have a complete different opinion ... you 're not seriously using the comments section of a very conservative newspaper to draw conclusions about the opinions of a whole nation ? 
  germany kicked all bosnians out after the war was over , did n't matter if they could savely return or not . 
  [ not explicitly ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/freik%c3%b6rperkultur#deutschland_2 ) , if it is n't sexual connotated . 
  nope , but wearing bandanas is something that gangs like the crips and bloods do . 
  wrong country , brudi . 
   merkel has imported islamism , parallel societies , and war into europe hahahahahah good one , seriously . 
  meanwhile , in reality , my new syrian neighbours keep bringing me food because i let them use my wifi . 
  but who knows , maybe it 's poisoned ? 
  he might be the next president . 
  yes , it 's banned in germany too . 
  that bavarian dude is an idiot , provoked the perpetrator into shooting at him .
