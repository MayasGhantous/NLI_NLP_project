  there are n't `` borders of europe '' . 
  it really depends on who you ask where europe ends and asia begins . 
  wikipedia , for example , defines europe differently : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/europe_on_the_globe_%28red%29.svg, 
   and the 19th one . 
  would n't paint that with such a broad brush . 
  there was also huge sympathies from liberal germans for poles after the november uprising 1830 : https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/polenlieder even hitler 's favorite musician richard wagner made a overture called [ polonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfrv8h6sf9a ) to celebrate the event . 
  we do n't though . 
  :( i ca n't speak for people living in the border regions , but most germans are pretty ignorant about poland and do n't really have a strong opinion . 
  all they know is that we attacked you in ww2 . 
  and of course lame jokes about poles stealing our cars . 
  there are efforts being made to better the understanding . 
  germany and poland just produced a [ schoolbook ] ( https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/politics/germany-europe/german-polish-schoolbook ) together . 
  also there 's a 4-part [ documentary series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2upcbfl82be ) coming out produced by german and polish tv channels . 
  i really hope in time we can build a friendship with you guys similiar to the german-french friendship . 
   poland is a great neighbour ** who we 've had a kinda rough past with ** , but currently everything 's fine . 
  that 's not accurate by the way . 
  sure , the 20th century was really bad , but before that poland and germany got along extremly well . 
  i 'm having a course at uni right now about the polish-german relationship , because my professor was advisor for a 4-part documentary series called `` die deutschen und die polen '' produced by zdf/3sat and tvn . 
  it will be aired in november 2016 , [ here 's the trailer . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2upcbfl82be ), 
  aww . 
  came to answer france . 
  i appreciate all our neighbours , but you guys are our bff . 
  oh maybe you did n't expect it from a german . 
  my comment was sarcasm . 
  did the queen appoint them all on her own ? 
  merkel was absent from the voting by the way . 
  i have more than one or two friends , i have a least a dozen german-russian friends and am acquainted with even more , because i get invited to their festivities ( their drinking really is no stereotype . . ) . 
  they 're good people , just wan na live a good life and work hard for that . 
  mind if i ask where you live ? 
  never heard of a little moscow with tens of thousands russians before . 
   or worse , some racist ass-hat criticizes integrated and respectable , integrated first and second-generation immigrants because of their skin color ( like the vice chairman of the afd criticizing that one football player ) . 
  boateng is n't an immigant . 
  he was born in germany and raised by a white mother single-handedly because his dad bailed on them . 
  i can only counter you anecdotal evidence with some more , but in my experience this is n't true at all . 
  some sp\u00e4taussiedler respect putin for fighting corruption , but many dislike him . 
  they hate being called `` russians '' , got ta be really careful about that . 
  my best friends parents from kazakhstan ( soviet union then ) are very anti-putin and support ukraine for example . 
  not true , there is [ a river next to the city ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/braunsbach/@49.1991017,9.7894214,875m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47985c81389a820d:0x5091edf9749b8570!8m2!3d49.1996106!4d9.7929983?hl=de ) and two small ones running underground in canals through the city . 
  on tagesschau they said that the underground river canals clogged up and then burst like champagne bottles . 
  it rained in one hour as much as usually in a month or even more ( between 60 and 100 liters ) . 
  i do n't think even bulgarians want [ these cars ] ( https://imgur.com/a/mnv7h ) anymore . 
  that 's the whole point of watching the show though . 
  8pts from switzerland < 3, 
  they had the best show , made them stick out . 
  it says isis and not iraq , syria or something . 
   who knows what the clown wants ? 
  he 's not the sharpest tool in the shed , but he knows what he is doing . 
   p.s look at the figures . 
  106 % turnout , 145 % in favour ? 
  i got that . 
  in favour of accession ? 
  considering the last weeks , i doubt it . 
  to me it seems erdogan wants to pre-empt the eu discontinuing the discussion . 
  if the balls were sitting on the seat to the aisle , this would work for germany . 
  i just realized mexico does n't fly into the map anymore . 
  change it back, 
  we still have a [ hohenzoller ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georg_friedrich,_prince_of_prussia ) who could ascend the throne , but he already said he does n't want to . 
  the russian monarchs too before the bolsheviks stood them in front of a wall . 
  berlin is always worth a visit !, 
  weather in germany is unpredictable , but generally in may it should be mostly mild weather during the day , but chilly nights . 
  rain is always a possibility . 
   also , the berlin memorial is one of the best in the world , so calling it a disgrace is n't even defensible as an artistic critique . 
  absolutely . 
  i admit , it looks stupid on pictures ( just a bunch of concrete blocks ) , but walking through it is amazing . 
  for those who do n't know , it makes you feel like the ground is moving beneath you through an optical illusion . 
  and underground is the information center which tells the history of the holocaust and does a great job of conveying the impact it had , by giving the names and telling some stories of individual victims . 
  first time i was in there , i was moved to tears and had to sit down for a while and process . 
  i 'm not a very emotional person usually . 
  you 're missing context . 
  h\u00f6cke is racist . 
  for example he once gave a speech where he compared the `` reproduction strategy of africans '' to that of bacteria , while `` europeans reproduce like other mammals '' . 
  ( [ german source ] ( https://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/afd-hoeckes-lehre-von-menschentypen,hoeckeslehre100.html ) ) so when someone who thinks like that calls the holocaust memorial in berlin `` a disgrace for our country '' , he does n't try to raise legit concerns , he 's being anti-semitic . 
   she identifies as a female . 
  i think it 's just a role oliver kn\u00f6bel ( real name ) assumes as an artist . 
  as far as i know he identifies as a gay man . 
   what 's wrong with the afd , in your opinion ? 
  they started out as a euro/eu-critical party and have since moved more and more to the right and are at this point just one step to the right away from being neo-nazis . 
  / u/aki-e - already mentioned the criticising of the holocaust memorial , but there 's a lot more . 
  for example andr\u00e9 poggenborg , state party chairman of afd in saxony-anhalt , just compared left-wingers to [ a malignant growth that needs to be finally removed from the body of the german people ] ( http://www.mdr.de/sachsen-anhalt/landespolitik/poggenburg-eklat-landtag-100.html ) ( deutschen volksk\u00f6rper ) . 
  v\u00f6lksk\u00f6rper is a word that could be straight out of a hitler speech . 
  another example : a while ago , bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke , spokesman of the afd thuringia regional association , compared the [ `` reproduction strategy of africans '' to that of bacteria ] ( https://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/aktuell/afd-hoeckes-lehre-von-menschentypen,hoeckeslehre100.html ) , while `` europeans reproduce like other mammals '' . 
  it 's pure racism . 
  i 'm not really buying the `` russia hacked the us election '' spiel the us government has been doing since the election , because they have n't provided any evidence to support this claim . 
  but even if it happened exactly as they 're claiming : everything that has been leaked was for real . 
  so if they can find anything about merkel that would change voters mind , go ahead , we should know . 
  i doubt they will though . 
  you can dislike merkel 's policies all you want but she is probably the least corrupt politician there is . 
  she actually rose to the top after her party 's leadership was shaken by a corruption scandal and they needed someone to clean it up . 
  merkel loves power and does n't care who she has to push aside to gain or retain it , that 's true , but she knows how to play that game without getting her hands dirty . 
  clinton did n't . 
  and merkel does n't seem to be interested in money . 
  that 's cute . 
  please take one at night !, 
  must be prettier with all the city lights . 
  certainly many more killings would suddenly become genocide if we included political groups . 
  the word might lose all meaning . 
  i do n't know how many starved from ration cuts , but of course there was still a shortage of food because of the bad harvest . 
  do you happen to have a source on numbers ? 
  however , the leadership of the soviet union had no intention to kill ukrainian workers .
