[ they took errr jerbs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=768h3tz4qik ), 
  not clearly mentioned in the article but in the end it is still the choice of the airline how they want to handle it . 
  you cant just hop on a plane and tell them that the easa said it is okay to do so . 
  [ a picture of the hercules monument in 1903 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/wilhelmshoehe_-_herkules_mit_kaskaden.jpg/800px-wilhelmshoehe_-_herkules_mit_kaskaden.jpg ), 
   twenty-first century fox ` s fox news channel has reached 147th consecutive month at no . 
  1 spot in total viewers among cable news networks , in both total day and primetime . 
  for the first quarter of 2014 , fox news was the only cable news network to grow compared to the prior year quarter . 
  higher ratings translate into better advertising revenues for the cable networks . 
  oh my , this is horrible . 
  why would anyone go to amsterdam/the netherlands when you could go to detroit or experience the wonderful act of a `` florida man '' ? 
  its funny , i am having a tough time when talking or writing in english but apparently i did good enough that the `` program '' thinks my native language is english . 
  guess reading and watching movies/tv shows exclusively in english at least gives me a `` feel '' for what sounds right . 
  well , otherwise you lot will reserve all the * good seats *, 
  as someone who traveled a bit of south east asia and had plenty of opportunity to observe koreans on their holidays i got ta say , * they * come across as rude , loud and arrogant . 
  * they * usually tend to keep to themselves . 
  if there is a dive shop they will end up at the one thats owned by a korean . 
  dont even bother to look at the other dive shops , their dive masters , employees , equipment or prices . 
  westerners or even other asians at least tend to take a look around . 
  but thats just my two cents , never been to s. korea ( well seoul just for transfer ) and cant say i ever came close to befriending a korean so i can only offer my observation and what other asians told me . 
  edit : and you have to keep in mind , south korea is doing very well especially compared to the south east asian countries . 
  so there is always a bit of jealousy involved i guess . 
  thinking back i feel sorry for our teacher back then . 
  mostly we were watching movies ( schindlers list , the life of brian ... and one time a jenna jameson soft-core movie when he was n't around ) , playing football or doing whatever we wanted . 
  the only time he ever really taught us something was about the five pillars of islam . 
  cant remember learning anything about christianity . 
  i get that people can be/are upset with politics/politicians but to vote for the afd you have to be mentally retarded . 
  we should send the afd monkeys to north korea for a year and then ask them again about * concept of democracy *, 
  did your so just leave you or why are you behaving this shitty ? 
  like he is already doing with the rest of the world ? 
  too bad if your trade-partner is governed by a lunatic who has totally different ethics than the eu , is not afraid to suddenly stop delivering goods , who uses military power/aggression to enforce his claims . 
  this crisis should finally help the west to realize not to trust a russian government . 
   also , fuck the frankfurt airport security and customs people . 
  some of the shittiest , least friendly , harshest ( one of them almost crushed one of my testicles once ) officials in the western world . 
  guess you never have been through heathrow customs , any airport in the states or the lovely customs service in india . 
  but back to topic . 
  its funny how often i met ( drunken ) foreigners that when in a dispute with a german ( or german speaking for that matter , have seen swiss citizens endure this as well ) start calling them nazis first , reminding them of the crimes of nazi-germany only to raise their hand a few minutes later , start screaming `` heil hitler '' and other fascist ramblings like you would hardly ever see a `` real fascist '' do in germany . 
  but i guess its okay , its `` cultural context '' . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9ahdr7evuw and how i actually came to first know him . 
  and again al jazeera seems the only place to really care . 
  commented live stream . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ ^ :(  ( dated ) the final or definitive solution to a question or problem, 
  yeah , how could someone dare to bash poor oskar . 
  here is the [ reichskriegsflagge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichskriegsflagge ) he has hanging in his office . 
  there is a project that started a few years back . 
  you obviously never went full ~ ~ retard ~ ~ shaved . 
  the whole area gets so sticky , you desperately want the hair back . 
   sate saus is it any good ? 
  i lived in indonesia as a child and i basically survived by eating plain rice and sate ayam . 
  my mother later tried to do the sate sauce herself but it never came close to the original . 
  currently listening to `` wrath of the khans '' since it has been mentioned so often on reddit . 
  great podcast and i am keen on seeing what else he has to offer . 
  anne-elisabeth moutet has an agenda and its pretty obvious ... just look at her other articles . 
  seriously ? 
  that is your reply . 
  classic example of comparing apples to oranges . 
  i am on the left spectrum concerning politics but even i find a questionable when the country starts to hand out welfare for immigrants who 've been here for a year . 
  i am fine with child benefits ( thats what they did get before ) but to `` profit '' from a system that they did not put any money into b/c they never worked here is somewhat strange . 
  sry to disappoint you but that wont be the case in the near future . 
  if i am not mistaken mr. s\u00fcdhof ( the german recipient ) has been working in the states for the past 30 years . 
  anyway , we all profit from the work those scientists do , the prize is * just * a recognition for the work . 
  switched from south african to german . 
  had to vote by mail b/c i am currently in holiday in se asia . 
  not really impressed with the spd but still voted for them with my 1st vote and 2nd vote for pirates . 
  again not really confident with them but i feel they at least have some positions not covered by the other parties . 
  i fear the fdp will make it but overall the cdu/fdp will fail to make it by themselfes . 
  spd/greens/linke is just something only the cdu is talking about . 
  highly doubt spd or greens are up for it . 
  is going to be interesting to see if the spd is keen on being the lesser partner in a grand coalition again . 
  what exactly would the goal of that mission be ? 
  get assad to stop what he has been doing for quiet some time now , get him to step down , `` arrest him '' , kill him , just get him to stop using chemical weapons and go on with conventional warfare ( b/c apparently that bothered nobody ) what then . 
  who is going to take over if assad is out of the picture ? 
  are the us&uk are going to negotiate with the rebels which include the salafist and muslim brotherhood ? 
  ja , i ` d rather have the [ prussian eagle ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/preu%c3%9fischer_adler_%281871-1914%29.svg ) . 
  yes they did . 
  what a charming guy . 
   1 return with an appropriate username . 
    2 do n't get involved in flame wars . 
  you do realize this is still reddit ? 
  sorry , but if those are the only reason to get involved in a `` modmail conversation '' something is very wrong here . 
  and the majority of those in favor i suppose live in the north of bw . 
  never heard anything of that sort here in the south ( i live like 15 min away from the border ) . 
  we do enjoy the good paying jobs across the boarder , and to have basel & z\u00fcrich airport close by , but the relations are not really that great . 
  when i am over in basel or z\u00fcrich i try to keep my voice down , otherwise you ` ll be looked at as if you have aids and are bleeding on everybody . 
   the commission on tuesday ** ruled ** that ** the pill ** , produced by german pharmaceutical giant bayer , ** is not harmful ** . 
  i highly doubt they put it that way ... 
  i guess they figured that the benefits balance the risks . 
  seriously there are so many drugs that can do harm if not prescribed properly or just have complex effects . 
  anti-depressants that can increase the suicide-rate , drugs to decrease sweating that can evoke hallucinations and countless drugs that have a risk of building blood clots . 
  there are always risks , its up to the doctor and the patient to outweigh the benefits/risks . 
  do not know about other eu countries but compared to english speaking folk `` we '' usually get to the point rather fast . 
  we do not talk about the weather for a few minutes just to casually mention we need a task to be done/need a favor . 
  in the states or britain that would be considered to be somewhat rude . 
  and apparently we stare , a lot . 
   anybody who thinks german can only sound angry has never heard rosy-cheeked children singing stille nacht . 
  [ absolutely agree with you . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mhi8zwndxo ), 
  my coin-stack is currently around 80-90 $ so that would take a while . 
  wallet : 2e = france , belgium , italy ( 2004 world food programme commemorative coin ) 1e = spain , italy , slovenia 50c = both italy 20c = spain not a single coin from germany in my wallet , what are the odds ... 
  fun fact . 
  made in stuttgart-bad cannstatt apparently latvia currently does not have a mint ( big enough ) to satisfy the demand .
