  interesting to see what mint marks they will have . 
  stuttgart is f. edit : well op already mentioned it , my bad, 
  neither french nor german . 
   fionn mac cumhaill i actually googled to make sure that wasnt a made-up name . 
  yeah i am childish : /, 
  sorry , but i am getting sick of the glorification of stauffenberg . 
  they did not want to kill him b/c of his acts , the holocaust , the dictatorship , his policies or something like that . 
  they were afraid that germany was going to loose the war and that hitler and his bad military policies where to blame and he needed to be killed . 
  there are so much more organizations , politicians , individuals who risked their lives to stop the regime , those are the ones that should be glorified . 
  the creation of a welfare state ( pension , insurance - for the working class ) , mandatory/compulsory education for boys and girls as early as 16th century ,, 
   and i believe we lack a tradition prior to 1945 well actually not that surprising since what we describe as germany today was not in existence until the mid-late 19th century . 
  oh boy , there is a plan right over my town . 
  not moving ... 
  i think this is all made up . 
  there is nothing about those so called protests in german media . 
  i am sure they will welcome our dear leader with open hearts . 
  it is always a pleasure to see hordes of swiss people coming over to buy meat here in s\u00fcdbaden . 
  some even go to the extreme and buy the shitty frozen stuff from aldi/lidl . 
  the attitude towards foreigners/immigrants . 
  would not call it racist , but its very strange to see how much support the [ svp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_people%27s_party ) gets . 
  i feel like every blick reader is a closet racist . 
  i hate everything about karneval/fasnacht ( whatever ... ) but [ morgestraich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnival_of_basel#morgestraich ) is something special . 
  i get goosebumps every time . 
  srsly , if you have the chance to be there , do not miss it . 
  battle isle , gothic ( series ) and mad tv are new to me . 
  i only knew anno , patrician , crysis ( farcry ) , port royale and the settlers were done in germany . 
  oh and apparently the x series ( x \u00b3 : reunion ) as well . 
  wait what , giana sisters . 
  i loved that on my c64 . 
  even more so than super mario bros. . good times, 
  you mean [ b\u00fcsingen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%bcsingen_am_hochrhein ) ? 
  i think you also have to give credit to those living there who do not share the same `` beliefs '' . 
  its one thing to go there as a black guy for a day and interview people ( sure not the most pleasant thing to do ) or to live there for years and have to deal with those people . 
  pretty sure they get their fair share of scrutiny . 
  yeah , came here to say the same thing . 
  the subtitles are rubbish throughout the whole piece . 
  we shall defend our czech brothers . 
  unless the us promises us the sudetenland . 
  i had to give up my south african citizenship at a much younger age . 
  did n't take me a sec to realize that i was `` german '' at that time . 
  if you can not make that decision at the age of 23 you may have a problem . 
   berlin - just because things work haha  yeah berlin is broke and pretty the much laughing-stock in germany . 
  the new airport is a shame , public transportation for years has seen its problems . 
  `` things '' in berlin do not particularly work very well . 
  and yes , compared to other european capitals ( bigger cities ) berlin is rather under-whelming . 
  obviously its certain areas of those cities . 
  neuk\u00f6lln ( berlin ) for example . 
  out of the 318.356 citizens 130.922 ( 41,1 % ) are immigrants . 
  is that from master and commander ? 
  i just watched the flick yesterday and cant remember seeing this . 
  i find it more interesting that portugal is leading in the race to build a road across the atlantic ocean . 
  is spain going to catch up ? 
  its the fdp . 
  the same old cockroaches who voted for them the last few years will emerge again when its time to get to the polling stations . 
  i was surprised by this as well . 
  never even heard it as a joke . 
  and even bavaria ; sure there are all those jokes and whatnot , but i never heard of a `` movement '' . 
  and if so certainly not as `` serious '' as the basques or catalonia . 
  in some cases not really stereotypes but just things that come to mind when i think about a country . 
  * ** iceland ** - geothermally heated sidewalks * ** ireland ** - green everywhere , great ( and easy ) to rent a boat and `` sail '' along the shannon * ** scotland ** - highlands , my favorite landscape in europe * ** england ** - music , tv , literature , humor , football , history , * secretly in love * , biggest population of hideous easy-to-get teenage girls * ** france ** - french revolution , white flag , la r\u00e9sistance , wine , baguettes & beret , german only sounds good when spoken by french women , perfume comes from the french word parfum yet they manage to have the worst odor in all of europe * ** netherlands ** - nice to watch football without success ( would not have it any other way ) , weed , prostitutes behind windows by the sidewalk * ** switzerland ** - constantly complaining how loud , arrogant , unfriendly `` we '' are , bank secrecy , weed sold in shops ( may have changed over the last 10 years ) * ** austria ** - mozart was german , hitler austrian . 
   * ** italy ** - best cuisine in the world , tuscany 2nd favorite landscape in europe , la dolce vita , world cup \u00b4 90 , rome the city of cities , the males stay with `` mama '' until they are least 30 , unless you are into blondes , the most beautiful and challenging women in all of europe ( i yet have to meet a girl from sicily that did not mess my head up ) * ** czech republic ** - beer , strange abundance of beautiful women , [ genscher at the german embassy in prague ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh9ewnurawe ) * ** poland ** - solidarno\u015b\u0107 , religious folk * ** denmark ** - sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d * ** greece ** - democracy , philosophy , greek mythology , the amazing old architecture * ** finland ** - depressing movies , a lot of great racing drivers for a country with such low population, 
  i am someone who really tries to be polite at all times , yes even on the internet , but this has to be one the stupidest things i ever heard . 
  i sincerely hope op is a troll . 
  there is no way a sentient being could come up with such a far-fetched argument . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldu8x_uqpra this is without spanish subtitles if they annoy you . 
  its just sad . 
  i talked about it with my parents this evening ( great topic on christmas eve isnt it ? ), 
  its hard to comprehend for us germans what devastating impact the crisis had for countries like spain and greece . 
  yes we were hit as was the whole world , but not near as bad as others . 
  i do not know anyone who lost a job or had to struggle to find a workplace and it spain there is a generation that basically has no hope . 
  last time i checked the ** youth ** unemployment rate was over 50 % ( compared to around 8 % in germany ) it doesnt take a rocket scientist to realize that a large part of that generation is looking for someone to blame which in turn creates a very hostile political climate in which crazy people can thrive . 
  it was around 12 c when i left home ( southwest germany , boarder to france/switzerland ), 
  ah god dammit , every time i see navidad i cant get `` feliz navidad '' out of my head ... 
  thanks for ruining my christmas : /, 
  we will have raclette as well . 
  been that way for the last 10-12 years, 
  great britain , then the `` balance of power '' would finally be obsolete and we could freely `` take care '' of europe ... ( and this time we would not build any dreadnoughts * promise * ) on a more serious note ; i think brits/french/germans would do well together . 
  after all the `` towels , baguette , lousy english cuisine '' jokes are said and done , i think we are more alike than some like to admit . 
   the problem is that he deletes normal posts that dont break any rules and bans people without explaining why . 
  care to give any examples ? 
  and did your post get deleted or did you get banned ? 
  the mods are doing the right thing and deleting outright fascist content that has been flooding this sub thanks to countless 3-4 old days accounts . 
  well he seems to be active at least . 
  do n't want to know how this sub would look like if not for some mods to take action . 
  its ridiculous to see all those 3-4 days accounts posting and pushing their agenda . 
  all those 4-5 days accounts flooding europe ... 
  seeing them waving the '' [ wirmer flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_wirmer#life ) '' is so infuriating the fucking nerve of those idiots . 
  its crazy how big vw is . 
  audi , seat and skoda are also subsidiaries of vw . 
  as well as porsche , bentley , bugatti and lamborghini . 
  that sounds like a good idea !, 
  [ how come norwegians are fat when they do n't have any butter ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norwegian_butter_crisis ), 
  i should really go to iran . 
  only ever heard how great it is supposed to be . 
  did you go by yourself and did you mostly keep to the populated regions or take a bike and tried to explore ? 
  yeah b/c swiss police are known to be so corrupt . 
  / r/european is that way -- , 
  woosh, 
  well if i have to keep local i guess i would go with [ massive t\u00f6ne - nichtsnutz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oh4bllmemc ),
