  5th class ( by now 1st class is mandatory if i remember correctly ) . 
  scandinavian languages were n't even offered , sadly . 
  depending on the exact type of school you could choose between latin , french and spanish, 
  how does it make such feelings with you ? 
  i guess you think about `` brotherly with heart and hand '' ? 
  if you feel this to be implyed by the phrase , i feel sorry for you . 
  not at all . 
  our anthem is the 3rd stanza of the deutschlandlied . 
  to call for `` unity and justice and freedom '' is n't the worst for an anthem and as of today it does n't feel outdated . 
  the other stanzas are n't sung for a reason , though . 
  but this combination does n't represent germany as much - it is known , but not as common in the northern states while currywurst is available practically everywhere . 
  completely agree - yet the problem you mentioned ca n't be emphasized enough : general overviews tend to be useless as you will find thousands who do n't know anything with others improving within weeks . 
  the german north-sea coastline . 
  it is simply beautiful to watch , the water quality is good and you have the wadden sea . 
  dessert : [ g\u00f6tterspeise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%b6tterspeise ) warm non - dessert : [ currywurst ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/currywurst ) maybe not the most complicated meals you can think of , but you 'll rarely find a non-vegetarian german who has n't eaten tons of both dishes . 
  edit : in 2015 vw sold more currywurst than cars . 
  on average around 800 million curryw\u00fcrste ( not only vw ) are sold in germany . 
  citroen ds is called die g\u00f6ttliche `` the goddess '' as a translation from the french name ( ds = d\u00e9esse = goddess ) . 
  the volvo p1800 is known as `` schneewittchensarg '' ( coffin of snow white ) due to the shape . 
  the mercedes w114 / 115 is called `` strich - 8 '' ( / 8 ) `` dash 8 '' as it was introduced 1968 , while the w189 is called `` adenauer '' as konrad adenauer chose this model as his car . 
  japanese cars are often called reissch\u00fcssel / reiskocher ( rice bowl / rice cooker ) . 
  big american cars ( the kind of car americans refer to as full-size ) are usually called `` amischlitten '' ( yank - sled ) the aforementioned trabant was often called `` rennpappe '' ( race - cardboard ) or often just `` pappe '' ( cardboard ) as the car had a composite bodywork . 
  not a slang name , but still frequently known : the vw golf is often read as acronym : ** v ** \u00f6llig ** w ** ertloses ** g ** er\u00e4t ** o ** hne ** l ** ogische ** f ** unktion ( completely worthless device without logic function ), 
  interesting , for me der spiegel is sometimes a little too far right, 
  as much as i agree , i 'd add die zeit and der spiegel, 
  you ca n't , but you ca n't neglect as well that they have n't risen further . 
  will they be in the next bundestag ? 
  most likely . 
  but are they the top story everyone else is still afraid of ? 
  nope . 
  same with their friends from pegida by the way . 
  pegida still is active , but their demonstrations are far less attended than a while ago . 
  all the other '' - gidas '' seem to have vanished almost completely , at least they 're completely out of spotlight by now . 
  i 'm quite happy with the system . 
  it 's incredibly complicated at times , but not prone to corruption and the laws generally are reasonable . 
  the premise is just different i guess : german law aims to punish a little , but keep the bad guy integrated in the society and prevent him from doing something bad again not by locking him away forever but try to improve his situation so he does n't need , does n't want to commit a crime again . 
  of course this system does n't always work , but generally - it does . 
  and there 's no country more aware of this part of our history than us . 
  even then , einstein was a german . 
  that he had to flee to save his life even more shows what to remember . 
  and what changed . 
  i 'd struggle to mention sophie scholl alone . 
  i 'd prefer a widerstand portrait of more people , like adding stauffenberg , tresckow or schulze-boysen . 
  i struggle as well with luther - of course important , but his role in the peasant 's war and his verdict towards disabled children let me see him less positive . 
  the only `` disputed '' border i know about is lake constance - germany , austria and switzerland could never agree on the exact border . 
  basically it does n't matter as all countries agreed to ignore the problem so if a swiss police boat intercepts someone in austrian claimed waters the results will be accepted by all countries . 
  maybe a thing to remember about `` die zeit '' is that it offers quite a variety in it 's point of view . 
  best shown by the fact that even it 's liberal-conservative , it 's official editor until his death was helmut schmidt , former federal chancellor ( and chairman of the center-left spd ), 
  you might add zeit and spiegel, 
   maaan , stop pooping on this cool subreddit with american politics this should be part of the rules over here . 
  it was covered literally in thousands of stories over here , the last story i read about it was on zeit.de , just half an hour ago . 
  ah , yeah , i forgot the `` elected '' part of the question , sorry, 
  not really in our case . 
  german fords are manufactured by ford deutschland which is a subsidary of ford europe and as such ford motor company . 
  of course everyone knows that ford is a us company , but nevertheless ford cars are usually associated with cologne over here as the majority of ford cars sold in germany are produced in europe / germany so ford is seen `` less american '' than gm for example . 
  though napol\u00e9on i did a lot of damage to his country as well , if things are summed up . 
  despite all his success , i guess he sent more people to their deaths than iii . 
  but i understand he 's held in higher esteem than iii , the latter did n't even have much success before losing . 
  i suppose they are too small to be sold in the us ? 
  honestly i do n't see any reason to buy a vw . 
  as you mentioned , you pay for the brand . 
  i 'd always prefer a skoda, 
  over here , japanese cars are generally held in high esteem for their reliability , but they are hated for the expensive spare parts . 
  a vw on the other hand is n't seen as reliable compared to a japanese car , but as the golf is the best-selling car since about it 's introduction you have a vast amount of spare part manufacturers , all qualities , all prices . 
  and every gas station has the usual wearing parts , every mechanic has repaired hundreds of them while he might have never seen the special toyota or subaru someone else shows up with . 
  on the other hand they are still seen as quite reliable . 
  fords reputation is below vw but still above all cars from italy , france and the us . 
  edit : i just checked a few numbers , the difference is impressive : in 2016 the most common vw-brands ( vw , audi , skoda , seat ) sold 1 229 399 cars . 
  even vw on it 's own sold twice as many cars as 2nd ranked mercedes . 
  ford ranks 6th with 239 766 cars . 
  the highest-ranking japanese manufacturer was nissan ( 12th ) with 72 547 cars with toyota on 13th with 71 783 cars . 
  honda sold just 25 331 cars , even porsche sold more . 
  at least that would be a contest , indeed . 
  uh , i 'd love to lose this game :(, 
  why ? 
  because we never have to think about the worst ? 
  best : konrad adenauer worst : hitler , obviously . 
  depends . 
  we know nothing about our ancient history , germanic tribes , little about medieval . 
  every child however is extensively taught about the failure of weimar republic and 1933-1945 . 
  i do n't think that there are many leaving school without having been to a kz or at least some other form of memorial . 
  and at least when i went to school the german reunification was taught a lot, 
  thanks , that was what i wanted to know / point out . 
  i 'm aware constitutions can be changed . 
  just from curiosity : in the german constitution a few articles are protected by an eternity clause . 
  that means amongst others you ca n't change democracy , you ca n't dissolve all federal states . 
  is there such a clause in your constitution as well ? 
  again , just from the view of someone being taught constitutional law for several years : why does this matter . 
  just not to be misunderstood : i was against scotland leaving gb and i 'm absolutely convinced these days borders within europe should be removed , not created ( i said i do n't have a personal opinion about catalonia for the reason that i absolutely do n't have any background knowledge about the arguments of both sides ) . 
  but i disagree with your argument . 
  you might dig in with hundred different arguments . 
  in my point of view , the question if it 's `` allowed '' to form an independent country has to be seen based on the spanish constitution , which i never read . 
  your point is an argument , not a fact . 
  a fact is that there is no authority , no absolutely undisputed way to judge if something is a country or not . 
  you may distinct ( country vs de-facto regimes , country vs federation etc ) , you may collect indicators ( reactions of other countries / un , ( non - ) participation in international treaties , embassy vs agency ) , you may even read good old jellinek and his doctrine of three elements . 
  but you ca n't rightfully say that catalonia is n't a country just for the reason it has never been one . 
  you can say you do n't want it to be one for this reason , but countries rise and fall so it 's hard to claim it ca n't be a country for your reason . 
  not downvoting you and i do n't have any personal opinion about catalonia at all , but why does it matter if a country has ever been independent before ? 
  i 've heard quite a bunch about constitutional law in my life , but that argument did n't show up so far so i 'm not sure if it really matters ?
