for me the connotation is more a ridiculous : * i throwing you all out . 
  i 'm the union now !, 
  so is map really about it risk , because the scale talks about expected strength ? 
   the composition of the portfolio should be adapted continually as the generation comes closer to retiring . 
  a financial crisis early on would n't be such a drawback as there would be enough time to recover the losses afterwards ( just look at the stock market from 2009 until now ) . 
  alas there are always a generation in the middle . 
   as the portfolio would only contain top graded government bonds at that stage you 're giving the government money now and they give you a recipe and guarantee money later . 
  you still rely on whoever makes up society at that later date to pay you . 
  it 's exactly the same mechanism except you are less secure because the state may default on it because society does n't care about external investors as much as about its own people if things go south . 
   and that would n't be each person for themselves . 
  i 'm talking about social security , like now . 
  except that it would be saved at the generation level . 
  for instance , all people born between 1980 and 1990 would be contributing to one common big governmental fund a. 
  all people born between 1990 and 2000 would contribute to fund b , etc. 
  when generation a retires , they get the amount in fund a divided by the number of retirees or soon-to-be retirees , etc. 
  so you still get social cohesion and social solidarity between well-of and poorer people . 
  `` so , your generation build the country when it was poor and made it rich ? 
  well , tough luck , everybody was poor so there is n't much in your pool . '', 
  - i do n't think that is a great idea for social cohesion . 
  and that is not even touching issues like how long do you plan to live ? 
  it 's just making up arbitrary buckets or constrains when it 's clear that a common pool provides the best long term security for the vast majority of the population . 
  yeah , the last financial crisis gave us a good idea what a brilliant idea that is . 
  / s each person for themselves is the worst idea for average joe to preserve wealth over decades . 
  you practically playing a lottery that the economy does n't do something stupid over many decades . 
  and then there 's the really fun stuff like wars or revolutions that may make everything you `` own '' worthless overnight . 
  they should add this as a policy edict in the next tropico game . 
  because glorious engineering . 
  what 's next , just planting a tree ? 
  there have to be sensors ( weight , object detection ) . 
  but still i 'm amazed that there 's not even a simple indicator and that it 's flush with ground level without any structure on it . 
  a lot things could go wrong with it ( imagine it goes up in front of a biker ) which could easily be avoided with a low tech solutions ( elevating it a few cm , put some plants on it , ... ) . 
  interesting . 
  not even some plate indicating it ? 
  this seems like a `` idiot parked a car above it '' incident waiting to happen . 
  ~ ~ thought the same . 
  i saw the uncut picture yesterday in a live feed , but i ca n't find it today anymore . 
  afair it was about putin arriving late to the concert . ~ ~ ~ ~ could have been on the guardian page , but i do n't see how to go back to yesterday . ~ ~ found it , little different angle but seems fake : http://zeit.superdesk.pro/content/media_archive/image/002/2862.92231108-neu.jpg, 
  thanks for the video . 
  the eyes do n't move in smooth arc , it 's more up and then straight to the side . 
  i 'm still 50:50 . 
  i know that everybody says she rolls her eyes on putin , but i think it 's what happens to me too when i do n't pay full attention to a conversation : the other person points somewhere while telling their story and i instinctively look where they point ... and of course there 's nothing there and you feel stupid . 
  without any recognition and without any treaties esp . 
  with their neighbours it would n't take long . 
  the uk and eu all agree on separating and everybody says that two years is a short time to achieve that . 
  catalonia wants to do it within 48 hours ? 
  granted that catalonia is n't the uk , but that sounds scary . 
   nobody outside of russia believes these fighters are not russians , and people in russia believe anything putin says . 
  i do n't disagree , this is just about keeping face - on paper . 
  as it does n't matter if russia shot down the dutch plane . 
  as long if there 's still a somewhat plausible deniability - on paper - and a * tiny * grain of doubt this can be mended diplomatically ... somehow ... over time ... eventually . 
   he will say `` that was homemade rocket device similar to to rockets hamas is making '' and this is what i do n't think russia does want to communicate internally , because that means they are not in control of their own territory/population , even if the outcome serves the agenda . 
  does n't it look weak internally ? 
   or will simply accuse ukrainians of trying to flood poor crimeans jesus , do n't give them ideas . 
  of course the `` tourist '' can , but that still means that russia has to admit that there are `` tourists '' driving around with tanks , artillery , anti-air , ... * within what they call russian state territory * . 
  so if they can do it in sevastopol , they can roll into novosibirsk or vladivostok too ? 
  `` it happened , what can we do ? '', 
  i 'm willing to pay admission seeing lavrov saying that on camera -- with a straight face . 
  but was n't that war fought by `` local freedom fighters '' and `` tourists '' ? 
  a heavy missile strike from crimea now is either the russian military proper or russia has to admit/spin a story that there are heavily armed forces running around on `` their '' * internal * state territory they have no control over . 
  i like standing in front of the desk as a gesture ( but not the trump crushing hulk hands ) . 
  but everything else ... the items on the desk are fighting with each other for attention , the depth of field feels wrong , the green of trees clashes with the other colors and drowns the outline of the person , lighting from multiple directions , every object is cut off somehow ... 
  here 's obama 's picture in a similar setting for comparison : http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/01/obama-2nd-portrait_1.jpg, 
  that 's not a compelling image composition . 
   i guess she speculated that anti same sex marriage parties will have a majority in parliament ( cdu/csu and afd ) , so it could still be stopped . 
  or at least a valuable bargaining chip when negotiating a coalition after the election . 
  this month i saw a u.s. comedian holding a fake head into a camera resulting in a statement of the secret service [ taking all that very seriously ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/arts/television/kathy-griffin-donald-trump-news-conference.html ) . 
  and then there was [ this `` free speech '' gem ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/suicide-texting-trial-michelle-carter-conrad-roy.html ) . 
  just from the top of my head sitting on the other side of the planet reading the news . 
  all i 'm trying to say it 's not black and white , there 's a lot of gray in every country . 
  hate speech does n't allow to threaten people and incite lawless actions though , a ruling also made by the supreme court . 
  free speech - even in the u.s. - does n't mean you can say whatever you want without being punished . 
   the reason why say the jsf will succeed versus the eurotyphoon is simple . 
  there is an alpha dog in the project that takes the input of the customers , but ultimately makes the decisions . 
  the reason why the jsf will succeed is that the deep pockets of u.s. taxpayer will pay for it until it is a success . 
  worst case scenario : combat readiness is limited/delayed by a few decades . 
  but who cares , it 's too big to fail now and nobody has to fear political consequences over it . 
  thanks for the work . 
  popular does n't necessarily mean it was a fad , e.g. 
  imho the game boy was real , [ this was the fad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tamagotchi ) . 
  i think he was so-so on the daily show , but i appreciate him a lot more since i listened to the [ bugle podcast backlog ] ( http://gamesplusone.com/thebugle/ ) . 
  his current show i do n't watch for the humor , but for the topics presented in an entertaining fashion . 
  no , i did n't . 
  but do we pretend we start with sticks and stones that after a few decades magically evolve into trains or rockets over night ? 
  i do n't think we do that either . 
  we move from [ that ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/first_flight2.jpg ) to [ this ] ( http://melbourneairport.com.au/cms_images/1647_15-01-2015_7400.jpg ) within a few decades and there are a gazillion steps and dead ends in between . 
   hyperloop and a mission to mars are examples of things that are n't incremental improvements . 
  of course they are . 
  we have vehicles . 
  we have planes . 
  we have low earth orbit vehicles . 
  we have vehicles that goes to the moon . 
  we have people going to the moon . 
  we have vehicles going to mars . 
  ... there are difficulties to overcome , but that 's always the case . 
  every step requires doing something not done before . 
  nothing is easy if you do it for the first time . 
  and there will be failures . 
  but not having it done before clearly does n't mean it ca n't be done . 
  if we agree on physics and technologically possible it comes down to engineering and costs . 
  the arguments i read here are not that sound to me .
