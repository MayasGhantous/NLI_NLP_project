well it is true that most of the towers he have in munich are somewhat ugly , but i think the biggest problem is that it is usually only 1 tower in their neighborhood . 
  the o2 tower par example , i think it would n't be so ugly when there would be other towers with him . 
  though that is personal taste . 
  well this is actually a good point ( personally i think people in bigger cities are less xenophobic too . 
  in my experience people who do n't have experience with immigrants are those who have the most problems with them ) . 
  but my issue with the landflucht is that whole villages get abandoned and the infrastructure rots . 
  i also think that the bigger cities do n't have the capabilities to absorb so many people in such a ( relatively ) short time . 
  you are right , decentralizing would certainly better and the `` landflucht '' is probably already a bigger threat than most people realize it . 
  but he do n't have 1 hub where everything is focused . 
  he have a few with frankfurt , berlin , stuttgart , k\u00f6ln , hamburg and munich . 
  and on top of it changing that is usually easier said than done , because in the end you always need the good will of those companies . 
  cities like frankfurt , hamburg , berlin and munich have a build a reputation world wide . 
  as a m\u00fcnchner you have certainly noticed how international the city has become over the last decade . 
  you can hear so many different languages in the subway or at the hauptbahnhof , there are so many international schools . 
  that is a part of our globalized world , too . 
  i is n't it understandable that they prefer munich instead of let 's say magdeburg ? 
  and all of them make munich a city with even more flair , creating a spiral between other cities . 
  paris and london have certainly there own problems , problems we should avoid . 
  but i do n't see how building a infrastructure in other cities and advertise them would help . 
  big international companies prefer to be at `` hot spots '' and if they do n't settle in those location they usually go to countries where the labor force is cheaper . 
  it can be a solution to give companies so many subsides so that they move to a different location . 
  and even more so , munich ca n't wait until that . 
  he have not enough apartments today , and things like the mieterbremse is just something for the voter , which will not have a huge impact . 
  i just do n't see any other solution than building more apartments . 
   why do all people have to live in munich ? 
  people go to places were they get jobs . 
  not to mention that people already live outside of munich and come with the s-bahn or autobahn to munich to work . 
  but you do realize that something like that causes problems , too . 
  the rent in the * m\u00fcnchner umland * exploded with munich , the locals in smaller * ortschaften * connected with a s-bahn to munich almost ca n't afford to live there , too . 
  and it is the same with bigger cities , augsburg counted as an insider tip for m\u00fcnchner who want to pay a cheaper rent , because you are in munich in around an hour . 
  but those times a long gone and there are plenty of m\u00fcnchner living already in augsburg , which caused that renting got quite expensive there , too . 
  i really think you are ignorant to the problem . 
  munich has way to less apartments and the city really really needs more of them . 
  that some want to keep the view from the city center to the alps is fine , but i really do n't see why higher buildings would be a problem in the north of the city . 
  well for once it is a benefit that bavaria is so religouse, 
  we have 13 holidays in bavaria but the number can vary in each bundesland ( [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_germany ) has a overview of it ) . 
  weihnachtstag on top of you get a minimum of ( i think ) 24 paid holidays . 
  well i know that stuttgart is in w\u00fcrttemberg , but i tend to call all of them badener , even those badenser ... 
  i do n't know ... it is probably my ignorance and that i have n't known that there is a rivalry between badener and w\u00fcrttemberger , similar to franken and bayern or baden badener and badener . 
  i would be interested in the logic behind it . 
  why use stuttgart as the capital of greater bavaria and not munich . 
  it 's not like stuttgart would be bigger or more * famous * than munich . 
  nevertheless , i think most people ( badener and bavarians ) will agree that both of them would rather join someone else . 
  baw\u00fc could join the swiss or the alsace ( if it really has to be another eu country ) and bavarians would surley prefer to be together with austria ( maybe even let vienna be capital ... maybe ) . 
   in germany , it is the social democrats , which are now present in the coalition government , which have always been in favor of strict export controls on arms , that is only what they say , but not what they do . 
  schr\u00f6der loved to do business with the saudis , too . 
  same in munich, 
  what have the italians to do with it ? 
  not having kids =| not having sex . 
  i know that is hard to believe when you come from some backward country which still teaches creationism . 
  wow one of the most leftish subreddits turned into a racists shit hole . 
  good job eastern europeans . 
  hitler would be proud, 
  yes the schickeria is left-wing , go inform yourself about them , kurt landauer , why they are friends with many left-wing ultra groups across europe , why they won the julius-hirsch-preis from the dfb and why the organize an anti racism tourney every year . 
  why do people who do n't have any clue about a topic talk about said topic ? 
  while bavaria is not very left , munich is . 
  munich is also one of the most cosmopolitan cities in germany . 
  not to mention that the s\u00fcdkurve and especially the schickeria is not as left as it gets . 
  they have also won the julius-hirsch-preis from the dfb last year . 
  a price to `` honour people who advocate for freedom , tolerance and openness '' . 
  the schickeria also organizes a anti racism tourney ( where the ultras st. pauli usually visit ) and fight for not forgetting bayern 's jewish roots with kurt landauer . 
  the club was pursued by the haider 's role model , because the club always was a open minded , cosmopolitan club . 
  and now you can go back to your keller, 
  my guess is that the eurozone would brake up completely . 
  i ca n't see how the nordics , eastern european , the dutch or austria would stay in a eurozone without germany . 
  some of their economy is heavily interlinked with the german economy and a devaluation would hurt their economy in a way that they would n't be able to adopt the changes . 
  not that the public would want to see their salary and pension get devalued in the way it would happen without it . 
  the ruling parties would all get punished in the next election and eurosceptic parties would rise and most probably even win . 
  that 's why it is much more likely in my eyes that those countries would join a `` temporarily '' monetary union with germany ( again ) or peg their old currency to the new mark ( again ) . 
  with the result that france and co. would have a new `` european lira '' and their public losing a lot of their wealth due to devaluation . 
  their voters wo n't like that and the eurosceptism will be rising and win influence . 
  good luck with that, 
   the dax at its peak this year was 12390.75 so why did you say ? 
   dax is approaching 20 % down in 2 months . 
  and your other excuse is a bit laughable , do n't you think ? 
  yeah you said it is approaching ... right . 
  the dax is even approaching 2000 % down , no ? 
  well i guess i am wasting my time here ... carry on and have a nice day, 
  may i ask why you always make shit up ? 
  a few days ago you spoke about a [ major shift in the public opinion in germany ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c4g6y/germany_says_it_wont_leave_greece_in_the_lurch/css5yhu?context=3 ) , which was n't true , of course . 
  and now you claim the dax is 20 % down in the last 2 month ? 
  the dax was a bit above 11400 points 2 months ago and yesterday it finished a bit under 10700 points ( source : [finanzen.net ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k2wvrgg.png ) ) . 
  that 's down around 6 % which is n't even close to 20 %, 
  btw : germany 's [ trade balance with ez members is pretty balanced ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/77151/umfrage/deutsche-exporte-und-importe-nach-laendergruppen/ ), 
   people who claim that germany and france is responsible are saying that they ( banks ) knew greece but they could n't ... greece reported wrong numbers ( including a wrong deficit and a wrong total amount of debt ) . 
   that does n't mean their banks should be unaffected they were n't ... banks were forced to write off more than 100 billion in the 2012 haircut . 
   the reason so many people seem to hate on germany is because they get fed the idea that it was german but that 's simply wrong and people who use that excuse are just trying to find something to blame germany . 
  sorry people who claim that , no nothing . 
  here look at how german banks were actually [ exposed ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/17/greece-debt-crisis-bank-exposed ) . 
  you could use this argument for spain or ireland , but for greece ? 
  do n't make me fucking laugh . 
  greek banks were saved . 
  you know those banks which hold the pensions and saving of greeks . 
  [ in the newest survey from friday , it 's up to 85 % against further concessions and only 10 % for it . 
  ] ( http://www.heute.de/mehrheit-gegen-weitere-zugestaendnisse-an-griechenland-39126218.html ) more numbers from that survey : * 41 % want greece to stay in the euro and 51 are against it * 27 % expect a heavy hit for the german economy in case of a greece default * 64 % still think that the euro is a longlasting and successful currency * 29 % think the euro crisis is threatening the survival of the eu, 
   so in 20-30 years , the debt is water under the bridge as it has been ` paid back ' by greeks continuing to buy goods from germany . 
  wait do i understand you correctly ? 
  greece should n't have to pay back the loans because it bought german products ? 
  that basically means german buys their own products and gifts to greece . 
  and you wonder why germans have a problem with that ?
