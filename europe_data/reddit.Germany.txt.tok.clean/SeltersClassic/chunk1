i missed the fact that you were aiming for the singular/plural distinction . 
  i had assumed you meant to say that the person was filmed by someone that was not a syrian refugee . 
  do n't want to be confrontational , but as i understand the situation it 's still the same meaning . 
  one refugee filmed another that claims to be affiliated with isis . 
  i agree that it 's disconcerting that there are probably members of isis among the refugees . 
  however it is a positive sign that others are willing to work with local authorities to expose those . 
  this sentence does n't need a question mark . 
  and possibly the phrase `` in germany '' . 
  that looks more like a subway than a proper train that goes between countries . 
  well , they are also reporting a lot of rape stories which later turned out to be made up :   http://www.morgenweb.de/mannheim/vergewaltigung-am-wasserturm-vorgetauscht-1.2618138   http://www.wn.de/muensterland/2247058-angeblicher-vergewaltigungsversuch-frau-gesteht-falschaussage-sexualdelikt-nur-vorgetaeuscht   http://www.wz.de/mobile/werther-bruecke-vergewaltigung-war-nur-vorgetaeuscht-1.2109250 it 's like they 're afraid that somehow they 'll be accused to cover shit up if they take some time to investigate . 
  well , the organization 's head diana henniges did spread the story without checking . 
  i agree that overall they do an admirable job and the conditions are not adequate , but they still need to be careful . 
  keep in mind that `` duck and cover '' is from a time ( 1951 ) before hydrogen bombs , giant stockpiles of intercontinental missiles or even mirvs . 
  while `` regular '' fission based atom bombs are plenty scary , they are typically magnitudes smaller than h-bombs and at the time would have been delivered mostly by bombers . 
  a war then with `` only '' atom bombs would have been devastating , no doubt - but it would n't have been a civilization ending event . 
  `` duck and cover '' gives sound advice if you are not directly under the bomb itself . 
  it is basically advice for protection against any type of explosion - `` get out of the way of flying debris '' . 
  even the `` cover head with newspaper '' advice makes sense since it shields exposed skin from an infrared heat flash . 
  if you are interested and willing to see past the `` survivalist prepper '' theme , here are some videos that help to understand the effect a nuclear weapon would have on a city .

  i kind of agree with you . 
  by taking them serious you lend them some credibility . 
  it should be made clear that `` sharia police '' is about as legit as `` wurstpolizei '' . 
  of course that requires everybody to be a well informed stable citizen that is no danger to fall for their theater . 
  which might be a problem . 
  i do n't know . 
  i see your point and tend to agree with it , but maybe it 's also a message to not take this too serious . 
  by banning the `` sharia police '' , the court would concede that this is a legit group that has the potential to disrupt civil peace . 
  by allowing them to wear their costumes they are reduced to wurstpolizei levels . 
  it would be nice if they 'd actually made that clear in the verdict . 
  something along the lines of `` sharia police '' vests have no more legitimacy than `` fashion police '' shirts . 
  of course , this would require that everybody knows that those are not to be taken serious because they have no legitimacy . 
  ( to be clear - i 'm only talking about them wearing those vests - the moment they start to actually harass people other rules apply ) it 's a bit similar to the question if we should allow people to label themselves as fascist idiots by using nazi symbols . 
  that was beautiful, 
  fwiw i 'm very disappointed that the uk leaves us alone with all this shit currently going on in the eu , but i hope everything will turn out ok for them and us . 
  i wonder if there 's a high cliff/rockface just behind the camera to produce this neat echo effect . 
  i think that 's it . 
  do n't know what the exact convention is , but in german these types of watergoing vehicles are called `` binnenschiffe '' , literally ships used inland - ie on major rivers . 
  actually reading the whole article ? 
  on reddit ? 
  preposterous !, 
  shame on me . 
  well ... at least i provided the wiki links for people that are interested in the river/canal tunnels . 
  edit , because my post reads somewhat negative when it was n't intended : very interesting . 
  i love unusual infrastructure projects like that . 
  there are some river/canal tunnels already , so it 's ... -- not the first shipping tunnel in general . 
  probably the first non-river shipping tunnel . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/weilburger_schifffahrtstunnel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riqueval_tunnel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rove_tunnel, 
  ummmmmm - yeah , that would be strange , right ? ... right ? 
  ( nervous sideways glances ), 
  is that so unusual ? 
  i always did that as a kid . 
  it was part of having a picnic break at a small creek after a few hours of hiking . 
  take off your boots and put your feet into the cool creek . 
  us kids then built a `` dam '' in a shallow part of the creek with rocks , dirt and pieces of wood lying around . 
  after the picnic the dam gets knocked down . 
  of course this does n't dam the creek completly , but you can sometimes create nice pools . 
  i 'd much rather go ~ ~ marching ~ ~ hiking in the mountains than lying on the beach , thank you very much . 
  instead of building sand castles , i 'll build dams in small mountain creeks , 
  interesting , but did that also affect the ( probably lesser quality anyway ) chocolate on mars/twix bars ? 
  i do n't eat one all that often , but i feel they tasted better in the past . 
  i have no problem with selling the b and c quality products - under different labels . 
  that 's like buying the `` off-brand '' product in the supermarket . 
  i do that all the time . 
  from what i understand , the problem here is that the food companies market the `` b '' and `` c '' qualities as the `` a '' quality one . 
  they act like it 's the same . 
  that is deceiving the customer . 
  if i 'd buy something like that in germany i 'd be pissed and feel ripped off . 
  candy - especially chocolate is indeed a sour point for me too . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's just getting older and my taste is changing , but i have the feeling that chocolate quality was much better in the past . 
  it 's not the more `` exclusive '' chocolate bars that are affected , but stuff like twix or mars . 
  while i know that they probably never used the best chocolate for that , i think their taste has changed . 
  i have a sneaking suspicion that food companies might use eastern european countries as a testbed to see how far they can go with cost saving measures before people begin to notice . 
  is n't something like this known for a long time ? 
  i mean - not necessarily that eastern europe gets objectively lower quality products ( which is despicable ) . 
  i 'm talking about a product not necessarily being the same all over the world . 
  i think i read something about nutella being less sweet in italy than in germany ( or was it the other way round ? ) . 
  or coca cola being made with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup in some markets . 
  i 'm sure the companies will excuse themselves with arguments like this - `` we tailor our products to the local taste and other circumstances of our target markets '' or some other marketing bullshit . 
   charleston shooting , oklahoma city bombing . 
  i 'm not too familiar with the details of those events . 
  from what i gathered , the okc bombing is indeed considered terrorism . 
  mcveigh seems to have had some co-conspirators which would support my hypothesis that an ideology and a coordinated effort is what makes ` terrorism ' . 
  on the other hand , the charleston shooting is apparently `` just '' considered a mass shooting . 
  while the shooter undoubtedly comes from a subculture that made him what he became , thats a bit too unspecific ( with regards to the incident ) to say there was a group that was coordinated in their efforts . 
  i could be wrong here though - just skimmed the wikipedia articles . 
  a german example . 
  the nsu murders : considered a terrorist group because of ideology and a coordinated effort . 
  the munich shooting is considered ` only ' a mass shooting because the coordinated effort for specific actions is missing . 
  at least that 's how i always understood it . 
   i believe that all of those attacks should be counted as terrorism if they did n't target someone in particular and attacked in random i assume your reasoning is that they all cause ` terror ' for the affected ? 
  that 's absolutely a valid view that puts the focus on the terrorized , however ... imho , the commonly accepted definition of ` terrorism ' means something different . 
  as i understand it , it 's shorthand for ideologically motivated violence - where the ideology is shared by a sizable group of people ( so there 's a possibility of repeated attacks , which seems to be the crucial point for me ) it implies some level of organisation - be it only the proclamation of allegiance to a certain cause . 
  for me that is missing from your common school shooting/amok run . 
  big , public `` bunkers '' are not just a hole in the ground . 
  apart from the food and fuel reserves that theoretically should be stored in them ( and need to be replaced periodically ) , the technical facilities require some maintenance as well . 
  things like generators , ventilation , sanitation , possibly communication . 
  when those facilities are n't being used for years or even decades , there 's a good chance they wo n't be usable when needed . 
   plus , why not just directly fund humanitarian stuff ? 
  the usual answer is that regions which need aid are often dangerous , so military is necessary to keep a situation stable long enough for the aid to have an effect .
