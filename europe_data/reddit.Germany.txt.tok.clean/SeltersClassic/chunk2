  hard to say if it always works , but thats the gist of it anyway . 
  i strongly suspect that there are italian comedy movies that use this gag . 
  it 'd be a shame if not . 
   you are not supposed to create a little swimming pool i 'm loving this whole conversation . 
  i can see that , it just feels cleaner . 
  i shower after doing my business in the morning and i hate having to go in a public toilet where i do n't have that possibilty . 
  hmmm ... 
  i 'm a bit skeptical about the shared butt-towel out in the open . 
  on the other hand it 's not that different from having regular towels hanging around in the bathroom ( provided everyone really washes up thoroughly ) . 
  maybe if there 's a careless family member with a really hairy butt i could imagine that would lead to some interesting family fights :d ah ... 
  i do n't know ... 
  i 'd probably opt for separate ones . 
  nevertheless , i think if i 'd build a new home i 'd include a bidet in it , just so i can relax my `` combined morning routine '' . 
  how common is this setup really in italy/other countries where this is widespread ? 
  i mean i get and like the idea to really wash yourself after doing business , but having a bidet always seemed a bit `` unnecessarily luxurious '' and `` one more thing to clean '' to me . 
  for me , my regular bowel movement is just part of my daily morning shower routine . 
  ( no , i 'm not talking about doing it in the shower  i got so many questions ... - do you use toilet paper at all ? 
  - how is the ass-towel thing organized in a family ? 
  i would assume everyone has their own ? 
  - is it just cold water or a normal mixing tab ? 
  yes , it is now . 
  as much as christmas or easter . 
  i 'm not a historian , but i know that the root of the whole thing goes back to pre-christian times , just like christmas and easter which the church also adapted for their needs . 
  so you have to understand that the roots of this whole thing are fucking old . 
  of course it has developed over time , but the overall theme seems to have remained roughly the same . 
  it is in its roots a ritual of reversal - winter spririts being driven out , daylight is returning etc. 
  take this idea of reversal and apply it to social norms and constructs and you get people that celebrate a loss of control and restraint in a society that otherwise values control . 
  also the theme of mockery of authorities is a huge thing in karneval - a reversal in the power structure . 
  ever wondered why people in germany wear those old-style uniforms during this time ? 
  to mock the powers that be ( who were wearing similar uniforms ) . 
  people that celebrate karneval in germany call themselves `` narren '' - `` fools '' . 
  for a few days they symbolically take over and everyone goes crazy before the 40 day lent begins and culminates in easter . 
  those floats need to be seen in this context . 
  it 's a traditional mockery of the powers that be and they just have to take it . 
  i 'm pretty sure that not everyone is really aware of all those things , but there 's a common sense about what 's going on via a shared culture . 
  for an outsider these things probably seem quite hateful . 
  they are not really . 
  the proper response to something like those floats is to laugh about them , take it and maybe think about what the criticism was and if there is a hint in it that you might take . 
  it 's all very ritualistic . 
  like this ?

  you do n't seem to know what karneval is . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnival carnival ( see other spellings and names ) is a western christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of lent . 
  [ 1 ] the main events typically occur during february or early march , during the period historically known as shrovetide ( or pre-lent ) . 
  carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus , masks , and a public street party . 
  ** people wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations , allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity . 
  ** [ 2 ] ** excessive consumption of alcohol , ** [ 3 ] meat , and other foods proscribed during lent is extremely common . 
  other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights ; ** social satire and mockery of authorities ; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features , especially large noses , bellies , mouths , and phalli , or elements of animal bodies ; abusive language and degrading acts ; depictions of disease and gleeful death ; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms .

  so sorry ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbh2k0cwwqu til the german intro music was co-composed by christian bruhn who also wrote the music for the german dub of `` captain future '' the intro music was performed by musicians from cologne , who would later become famous as the `` bl\u00e4ck f\u00f6\u00f6ss '', 
  when fatboy slim 's `` right here right now '' came out , it reminded me of this intro . 
  yep . 
  czechoslovakian kids programs were highly popular ( dubbed of course ) . 
  i also remember pantau , expedition adam84 . 
  there were also some others , but i forgot the title, 
  oh , yes we did . 
  it was actually incorporated into the `` sendung mit der maus '' love the `` kleine maulwurf '', 
  is the dvd any good ? 
  ( quality of transfer etc ? ), 
  that show was fantastic . 
  wanted to have that lada niva so badly as a kid . 
  also some quite high-brow scifi concepts for a kids show ( iirc - have n't seen it in ages , sadly ) . 
  oh , god yes . 
  as a kid i loved everything on tv coming from then czechoslovakia . 
  did n't know it back then of course . 
  they really produced great kids programs . 
  more stuff coming back to me now : expedition adam 84 ( * die besucher * / the visitors ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0kxsw3qtss pan tau https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eafzyoqjbla there was also another one with weird clay figures mixed into live action . 
  forgot the title . 
  how about the current public broadcasters of europe pool their relevant content and make it available to the whole of the eu via an online portal . 
  of course the content would need to be subtitled in english . 
  most of them probably already have online archives of their stuff . 
  just remove the geoblocking . 
  hard to say if its worth keeping the gold safe when your country is a turned into rubble . 
  if it 's really the end , then probably not . 
  however , having a plan for all eventualities does n't hurt . 
  consider a thoroughly destroyed country . 
  all assets that could be used to rebuild are gone . 
  no factories , no infrastructure etc. 
  however , some people are still alive , but they now have nothing . 
  suddenly the idea of still having something of value that can be bartered for food , machines , medicine seems quite appealing . 
  apart from the currency backing function , the gold reserves are the `` last reserve '' of valuables that can be brought forward should the country fall on hard times . 
  as such , they also serve a psychological function . 
  correct . 
  one of the ideas is to be able to easily trade gold into hard foreign currency should the need arise ( for example some disaster that would cripple the deutschmark - now the euro ), 
  if the cold war would have ever gotten hot , the bundesbank in frankfurt , like most of germany would have ended up as a giant radioactive crater . 
  due to the iron curtain running through the middle of germany we would have been targeted by both the usa and the soviet union . 
  at the very least the chances to be overrun by the warsaw pact were quite high . 
  in order to not put all eggs into such an insecure basket , the bundesbank spread out our gold reservers ( which is meant to be used in case of just such a disaster ) to london , paris and new york . 
  also it 's easier to convert the gold into hard foreign currency in the countries directly in case it 's necessary . 
  / r/germany ^ i think this sub is mostly used by expats and foreigners asking how to study in germany . 
  also the occasional news story with international appeal . 
  for the real german ( speaking ) experience - / r/de, 
  i was under the impression that sub was mostly used by expats in germany . 
  anything in the study about the possibility that they do better because the gay couple has to overcome a certain resistance to them being parents ? 
  to me that would imply that they really want to have children and are prepared to actually put in some effort into their parenting . 
  which might not be the case for the average over the whole of straight parents . 
  i 'm always a bit cautious about the public interpretation of studies that show that one group does better at something than another .
