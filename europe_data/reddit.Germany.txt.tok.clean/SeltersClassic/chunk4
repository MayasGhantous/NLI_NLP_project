  he may have gotten the broad strokes right , but do n't expect historical accuracy . 
  he painted a positive picture of the native americans though that endeared them to generations of germans . 
  i think i read somewhere that is because either by design or by accident readers made a connection to our own history of german tribes struggling with invading romans . 
  around the same time he wrote his stories , the fascination with that part of our own ancient history was quite high as it could be used to support the formation of a coherent german national identity . 
  the most famous example for that is possibly the craze about arminius , a chieftain of the cherusci that won a famous battle against the romans around the year 9ad . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arminius of course , the 19th century contemporary view of arminius is also very flawed and naive . 
  so you have a fascination about a somewhat glorified german prehistory and a writer that writes stories about faraway tribes also struggling with invaders . 
  i think it 's easy to see how people might have subconsciously drawn parallels , feeling a connection to the native americans . 
  still - the picture karl may painted is wildly inaccurate . 
  it 's a fantastical version of native americans . 
  i sometimes compare it to comic superheroes like thor ( albeit without super powers ) . 
  due to the generations of kids that read karl may this view has been cemented and you get adults dressing up as and imitating their heroes . 
  i can understand very well how real native americans are confused about this , maybe even feel insulted . 
  i get critical of that phenomenon myself when people start to take this cosplay serious and think they act like `` real indians '' . 
  on the other hand the interest can be a good starting point to educate oneself about reality . 
  tl ; dr native americans of the old west were the template for a 19th century german `` comic-book '' hero - an apache chieftain who is best friends with a german trapper . 
  edit : about those `` powwows '' ... 
  i 'd say they are not that common , but they do exist . 
  due to the aforementioned reasons , there are quite a few people that are interested in something like that . 
  as is good german tradition , they organize themselves in a `` verein '' ( club ) . 
  my guess is that their number could be comparable to that of people who attend renaissance fairs . 
  i 've never personally met someone that goes to such an event , but i strongly suspect that for most of them their activities are made up - possibly based on some half-knowledge and stuff seen in movies . 
  i could imagine that there are better clubs that seek permission and some tutoring if such a thing is even possible . 
  as someone who lives just barely within the footprint of the astra2 satellites that carry the uk programs - thank you for broadcasting the bbc free to air . 
  and a honest thank you ( and sorry ) to the people paying the licence fee . 
  i know in principle you could watch german public tv which broadcasts fta as well , but i have to say i 'm getting the far better deal here . 
  ah , ok . now i know what you mean . 
  saw a `` documentary '' once on one of the additional zdf channels about a supposed german atombomb . 
  i assume it must have been one of those bought things that could have run just as well on n24 . 
  flimsy `` evidence '' , shoddy arguments and 45 minutes that proved nothing . 
  that was n't even `` info `` tainment . 
  was actually angry afterwards . 
  totally forgot about lexx . 
  was n't that a co-production with canadian tv though ? 
  i 'm still waiting for that raumpatrouille reboot :d i agree that the bbc is undisputed master of documentaries and there are definitely more high profile ones , but are ours really bad ? 
  they are mostly on a smaller scale , sure . 
  could you give an example of a documentary that did n't meet your standards . 
  i always thought that there are ( were ) some quite nice nature documentaries ( i might remember the past here though ) or do you possibly mean all those guido knopp ones - `` hitlers ... something something '' . 
  might depend a bit on the topic . 
  i 'd say the factual programs like documentaries are ok to excellent sometimes . 
  they are also good in the news department . 
  those are things that private tv channels do n't do at all . 
  i can tolerate the `` service '' shows during the day where they cook or give gardening tips or stuff like that . 
  my elderly mother likes to watch those . 
  at least it 's better than scripted reality . 
  when it comes to fiction though ... 
  it 's mostly godawful . 
  cop and hospital shows until you have to puke ( most of them of questionable quality ) . 
  just the fact that there has n't been a german scifi show since 1966 should tell you everything there is to know about the state of things . 
  even if you do n't like scifi , it show shows that there is no one willing to think outside a certain box . 
  i think at this point there is hardly anyone in the german tv industry that could actually produce something else than 25th version of soko ( cop show ) . 
  the problem is that even if they would actually do so now , no one would notice . 
  the people that would watch something innovative have long since given up on tv . 
  edit : i do support the system for the few gems the public broadcasters produce . 
  as already mentioned arte is quite good . 
  also 3sat and phoenix . 
  on the radio side some local broadcasters are relatively good and there 's also the nationwide dlf/dradio wissen ), 
  we usually just mix a teaspoon of it with plain yoghurt to get a strawberry/fruit flavored one . 
  agreed . 
  it 's a very common thing i 'd say . 
  your picture could be taken in our pantry , complete with the handwritten stickers . 
  for a long time we had our own strawberry patch . 
  nowadays my mother ca n't do garden work as well any more . 
  she still buys a whole lot of strawberries when they 're in season and makes selfmade jam . 
  also ( way too much ) cherry jam that gets distributed to whoever wants some . 
  i 'd say strawberry . 
  followed by apricot , cherry and currant . 
  but maybe it 's only in my family . 
  here 's one very simple example that does n't involve the usual `` heavyweight '' arguments that invoke philosophers or politicians : i grew up watching [ der kleine maulwurf ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/der_kleine_maulwurf ) / [ ( krte\u010dek ) ] ( https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/o_krtkovi ) and [ es war einmal ... das leben ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/es_war_einmal_\u2026_das_leben ) / [ ( il \u00e9tait une fois ... la vie ) ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/il_\u00e9tait_une_fois..._la_vie ) among many other shows , of which i only later learned that they originated from then czechoslovakia , france and other european countries . 
  i guess you could book that under `` shared culture '' . 
  not to forget all the other stuff below the surface that europeans shared and copied from each other since ancient times and we hardly ever think about . 
  we already have some sort of inofficial alternate title for our head of state ( bundespr\u00e4sident ) `` gr\u00fc\u00dfaugust '' or `` gr\u00fc\u00dfonkel '' ( lit . 
  greeting august / greeting uncle ) it 's the term for someone who holds a representative position , but has no real power . 
  their only job is to put up a nice facade and greet people . 
  i think the term originally comes from the person that welcomes new guests in the lobby of a hotel . 
  the name `` august '' probably comes from `` der dumme august '' ( the dumb august ) , a clown figure . 
  as you may have guessed its intended to be disrespectful . 
  i 'd say - ** wernher von braun ** he 's usually credited for his contribution to space exlporation in general and the moon landings in particular , but he also played a role in the 3rd reich using slave labor in the german rocket program . 
  - ** werner heisenberg ** the german physicist , nobel prize laureate and generally a physics `` celebrity '' . 
  he was tasked with the german nuclear program . 
  iirc there 's a lot of speculation going on how enthusiastic he was about it . 
  depending on what you believe to be true he may be criticized for aiding such a program that would potentially give the nazis the atom bomb . 
  i 'd say these two examples are often bought up especially among stem audiences as people that were n't necessarily nazis , but somewhat profiting from the system . 
  either because the lived in their ivory tower of academics , not really caring about the world around them as long as there is fascinating research to be done , or because they could actively use the system to achieve their dreams ( again ignoring all the rest ) while these two examples are probably not as divisive as some others mentioned here , they still show that admired figures should be viewed from every possible angle , not only from the one that makes them look good . 
  ** the nebra sky disk ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nebra_sky_disk a bronze disk from around 1600bc depicting the night sky . 
  wikipedia :  if authentic , the find reconfirms that the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the people of the european bronze age included close observation of the yearly course of the sun , and the angle between its rising and setting points at summer and winter solstice ** saalburg ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saalburg the saalburg itself is a reconstructed roman fort on the `` limes germanicus '' . 
  it is used as a museum for archeological finds concerning this border fortification of the roman empire in central europe . 
  for anyone wondering - `` ami '' rhymes with `` mummy '' concerning the yankee thing - i 'm inclined to agree with op . 
  germans that know the term probably also see it as very anachronistic . 
  i 'd say that most would associate it with wild west movies . 
  water . 
  maybe mixed with with a tiny bit of apple juice if i feel fancy . 
  that 's for a regular workday lunch . 
  edit : for special occasions or a fancier dinner in general i 'd drink wine or beer depending on the meal . 
  if i have to drive or just do n't want alcohol i might go for some special fruit juice ( blackcurrant , sour cherry ) . 
  what is her view of the situation here in germany ? 
  does she believe rape-gangs are roaming our streets too ? 
  did she experience anything `` dangerous '' in germany ? 
  if not you might have an argument trying to convince her . 
  some of the `` alternative '' media also paints a very dark picture about germany .
