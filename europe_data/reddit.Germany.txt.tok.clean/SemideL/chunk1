some comment under the video linked [ this article ] ( http://therightscoop.com/graphic-immigrants-attack-in-germany-video-being-shared-on-social-media-isnt-what-it-actually-is/ ) , i 'm not sure whether this is legit however . 
  ** ** [ german ] minister of the interior de maizi\u00e8re favors fixed refugee contingents in the recent spiegel edition . 
  if these were exhausted , even politcally persecuted would have to be sent back to their home countries . 
  federal minister of the interior thomas de maizi\u00e8re aims to cap the number of refugees in germany with a new european asylum law . 
  it would n't be possible to seal off europe , `` but we can not take in everyone from crisis areas or fleeing poverty , who wants to come to europe and germany '' , he told in an interview with spiegel . 
  `` the right solution would be committing to fixed and generous contingents for refugee intake . '', 
  this way it would be ensured that europe only accepts as many refugees as it could sustain in the long run . 
  the current german asylum law would stay unaltered according to the minister ; however , de facto it would lose significance beside a europe-wide regulation . 
  `` if we want to elevate specific political functions onto a european level we have to surrender a part of our german sovereignty '' , the cdu politician said . 
  in case these contingents are exhausted , de maizi\u00e8re would send politically persecuted back into their home regions . 
  one would have to ensure that those sent back could live there in peace , without the risk of persecution . 
  europe would need strong external borders , de maizi\u00e8re said . 
  refugees who would have sailed across the mediterranean sea to enter the eu illegally , should be brought to a `` safe space in africa '' . 
  otherwise , even a contingent solution would be pointless , according to the minister . 
  [ ... ] ** gr\u00f6he proposes a refugee healthcare card ** meanwhile , the ministry of healthcare under hermann gr\u00f6he ( cdu ) proposed a law introducing the healthcare card for refugees . 
  the spiegel has recieved information telling that , according to this law , statutory health insurances could be mandated to hand out healthcare cards to asylum seekers . 
  federal states and districts are free to negotiate conditions which health insurances would not be allowed to refuse in the future . 
  so far , such cards are only available in hamburg and bremen , north rhine-westphalia wants to follow in january . 
  the healthcare card had been one of the major demands of baden-wuerttemberg 's mp winfried kretschmann ( green party ) during the recent asylum compromise between federal and state governments . 
  in the city states hamburg and bremen these cards are already handed out to refugees - with positve results . 
  however , healthcare services available via these cards are significantly restricted in comparison to the usual healthcare cards .

  how about a short translation ? 
  on friday , shortly before 1pm , the police was called to chemnitzer stra\u00dfe . 
  the market 's security guard has caught two men trying to steal . 
  these then attacked the staff . 
  right after retreating , the two men came back and threatened the market employees with pepperspray and what seemed to be a machete . 
  afterwards they left . 
  while the police that by now arrived at the location started investigations , the two suspects came back [ once again . ], 
  while one suspect was seized without resistance , the other one , supposedly carrying the machete , approached the police man . 
  the officer then fired a warning shot in the air . 
  the suspect then threw stones at the police men and fled . 
  immediate investigation messures were n't successful . 
  the first suspect ( age 27 ) is arrested for now . 
  the criminal investigation department is now searching for the second suspect . 
  as the police department now reports , the second suspect , a 27 y/o libyan citizen , has appeared at the market once again this morning . 
  after the market staff spoke out a house ban , he threatened an employee with gestures . 
  `` the gesture mimicked cutting her head off , '' one spokesman of the chemnitz police department said . 
  then he swung a knife around viciously on the parking lots and fled . 
  the police now pursues investigation at full stretch . 
  here is an extract from the german basic law , ~ ~ section ~ ~ article 16a :  ( 1 ) politisch verfolgte genie\u00dfen asylrecht . 
  rough translation , keep in mind that english is n't my native language :  ( 1 ) politically persecuted people enjoy the right of asylum . 
   ( 2 ) [ tl ; dr ] except you come from another eu country or a third party country in which the application of the human rights convention is guaranteed . 
  such countries are further determined by a law the bundesrat has to approve . 
  turns out , this laws are the [ sections 26a ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/asylvfg_1992/__26a.html ) and [ 29a ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/asylvfg_1992/__29a.html ) of the german asylum law with their respecting appendices [ appendix to 26a ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/asylvfg_1992/anlage_i.html ) and [ 29a ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/asylvfg_1992/anlage_ii.html ) . 
  i do n't see the us in the list of exceptions , however i would assume that refugees from the us are most likely declined , since there currently is no humanitarian or political crisis going on there . 
  ( and no , even if just for a joke , being an atheist does n't mean you are persecuted . 
  :p ) edit : did i just call an article in the grundgesetz `` section '' ? 
  oh my , such an embarrassment . 
  interesting that bild , of all newspapers , now voices opinions in favor of refugees . 
  a recent [ bildblog article ( in german ) ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/69287/brandstifter-im-loescheinsatz/ ) explains why this could be considered kind of hypocritical , because it was bild who agitated severely against refugees in 2007/08 , including manipulating satistics , ignoring facts and appealing to anecdotal evidence . 
  if i remember correctly ( i can not find a source for that one for now ) there was the proposal of setting up extra shelters for refugees from the balkan . 
  in combination with declaring balkan states as safe states , this might speed up the process by a fair amount . 
  considering that 99 % of refugees from the balkan get declined anyway [ 1 ] , maintaining such an extra system might free up ressources for all the other refugees . 
  besides , there is still a debate on the `` balkan as safe states '' issue [ 2 ] . 
  ( 1 , german ) : http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/asyl-kein-tabuthema-1.2601305 ( 2 , german ) : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/gruene-stellen-sich-gegen-ausweitung-sicherer-herkunftslaender-a-1048734.html as for the neo-nazi issue , i have come to doubt whether this is a problem even worth solving . 
  on the first glance i can not think of any better solution for battling xenophobia than constantly confronting the population with ( successfully ) integrated refugees , constantly reminding them that immigration is neither a `` threat for the german culture '' nor something one must be afraid of or worried about . 
  edit : formatting, 
  you are reading right , the point is , i guess , how one defines `` god '' . 
  it may be possible to hold the belief in a deistic concept of god while simultaneously believing in aliens or witchcraft , but to not affiliate oneself with a particular religion . 
  these are independent matters of belief . 
  what i find a little bit strange is  romanians also believe in [ ... ] heaven ( 60 % ) , hell ( 58 % ) , and afterlife ( 54 % ) . 
  so , if my math is correct , there are at least 6 % that do believe in heaven or hell , but not in an afterlife . 
  how does that make any sense ? 
  what is the point in believing in heaven/hell when one does n't expect to even experience these `` places '' ?

  in germany it 's definitely [ otto lilienthal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_lilienthal ) , who built his first gliding plane in 1891 and died in 1896 - due to a plane crash . 
  edit : oh , you mean * powered * planes ? 
  well , then it 's rumored to be [ gustav wei\u00dfkopf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gustave_whitehead ) ; but i doubt he counts , since emigrated to the us and there is n't a conclusive record of his flight attempts . 
  the title is a little misleading :  the draft law states : `` the processing of personal data of a child below the age of 16 years shall only be lawful if and to the extent that such consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child . '' so teenagers are n't banned from social media , they just need an extra step to join . 
  and besides , i doubt it 'll work in practice : `` hey , are you at least 16 ? '', 
  - `` erm , well ... yeah , sure i am , i guess ... '' - `` okay , welcome to our service then . '', 
  this one sentence really struck my nerve :  we have to be ready to die singing and laughing along knowing that in the end openness and diversity always wins . 
  win * what * exactly ? 
  i 'm sorry , but in days like these i 'd be rather careful with empty phrases . 
  what we need now are not words , but pragmatical solutions for actual problems . 
  if we could agree ( and i 'm sure we could ) that the europe we know and love is under threat , we should response to that . 
  so , to turn back to your original question : what to do after the attacks ? 
  we know that is claimed responsibility for the attacks and france is willing to increase military efforts in syria . 
  how ( i 'm pretty sure it 's superfluous to ask whether ) should other european nations support them ? 
  i 'm not sure whether germany ( both politicians and the population ) is ready for another bundeswehr operation out of area , for instance . 
  and i 'm not sure whether other nations are ready for this either . 
  hmm , not really ... ? 
  technically and academically , certainly europe and russia are on similar levels . 
  russia has a long-lasting tradition of famous mathematicians ( some of you might know [ perelman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grigori_perelman ) for example ) . 
  also it contributed to some key technologies in the mid and late 20th century . 
  but politically ... 
  i can not put my finger on it , to be honest , but there is something beneath the surface of obvious diplomatical chatchphrases which separates russia from the rest of the european continent . 
  democratic values ( freedom of speech , freedom of press , lgbt rights ) do n't seem to be well established there and occasionally putin barks torwards the us and/or eu leaders ( recently because of the russian plane crash in egypt , where putin blames cameron for allegedly holding back intelligence data that - allegedly - would have revealed an islamic terror attack ) . 
  and because , at least here in some german media channels , we get to hear both media outlets from the us blaming the russian government for any tragedy that happens to take place somewhere and vice versa , you do n't really know what or whom to believe in some cases . 
  i do n't know if russia would be comparable to europe with a different president or different laws . 
  but surely the russian citizens ( west of the urals ) have more in common with europe than , say , china . 
  as for now , i would consider russia as a unique cultural entity . 
  ... well , you asked for it . 
  i had to learn a lot of poems in school , now it 's my time to prove that my lessons in classical german literature were n't wasted . 
  :p let 's start with the most obvious : [ * der osterspaziergang * ] ( https://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/pommeren/gedichte/ostern.html ) by johann wolfgang goethe . 
  the official title is * vor dem tore * and is an extract from goethe 's stage play * faust , der trag\u00f6die erster teil * in which faust , the protagonist , takes a walk out of town and marvels at the natures beauty . 
  the poem is a little long - god , there was a time i knew it by heart . 
  - so i linked it above . 
  also a classic one by goethe : [ * der erlk\u00f6nig * ] ( http://ingeb.org/lieder/werreite.html ) , a ballad which tells the story of a father who rides through the forest , while his son is pestered and threatened by a spectre ( ? ),
