  sounds a bit dingy . 
  russia still likes to use undercover agents , the americans-style . 
  look at the other map . 
  german is the no. 1 language on duolingo in namibia . 
  a lot of staff on german-speaking cruse ships are from southeast asia , could be the reason for indonesia . 
  imperial austria still stronk !, 
  for the cliched honeymoon in paris and the diving holiday in french polynesia . 
  maybe , i also expected some pacific asian language . 
  this is the most british discussion i ever had the privilege to witness . 
  before the euro , italians joked about the nl on dutch number plates as niente lire - no monies here, 
  i have no problem with this . 
  whoops , that brain fart 's on me . 
  this is not something where party leaders should insist on a line vote , in my opinion . 
  the individual mp are under enough pressure already , if they dare voting against the winning side in their consituencies . 
  the snp mps , for example . 
  the snp supported the remain side , and pro-eu is a core principle of that party . 
  scotland however , voted leave in the overall count . 
  what you 're gon na do ? 
  username checks out . 
  true dat , b\u00f6hmi should be safe from a mere legal point of view , but imagine trump 's reaction to this once he 's in office . 
  not that i would want that , obivously . 
  hopefully we abolish that fucking crimen maiestatis paragraph before it 's to late . 
  so , the commisson should hire journalists whose task would be to independently inform about locally relevant eu stories , while still being on the commisson 's bankroll . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  no , the implications of the term `` shocking honesty '' . 
  um , where did that come from ? 
  so far , there has been no evidence or even the impression of cover-up attempts by german authorities regarding terrorist links of arrested refugees . 
  that is so true . 
  shopping before the three days of christmas feels like an impending nuclear war . 
  scotland and ni voted remain , let 's keep them as a celtic union and glue them to brittany . 
  which is served lukewarm and uncarbonated . 
  checkmate . 
  afd and pegida supportes exist in all age groups , and their strongholds lie in the former east . 
  there are more than enough people who do ( or at least should know ) , what 1989 means . 
  socialists supporting the eu ? 
  that 's a good one . 
  incoming tumblr invasion in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  the usurpation of the civil rights symbols from the peaceful protest against the gdr regime is simply disgusting . 
  it is no coincidence that pegida schedules their gatherings on a monday . 
  [ for non-germans : in 1989 , the civil rights / peace groups held their demonstrations on mondays , the term `` montagsdemonstration '' is of high symbolic power ], 
  well , she was n't good for turning . 
  do n't forget our prehistoric youth protection legislation and gema . 
  just a few months ago , content holders managed to block an attempt by the eu to unify the media market . 
  pretty dissappointing article in general . 
  no figures , no concrete mentioning of creationist groups or their tactics , no explanation of goals or where the alleged well-funded groups get their money from ( i was not aware of such movements ) . 
  in the end , the article does n't say much more than `` creationists . 
  they exist . 
  in europe . 
  they do n't like evolution . '', 
  like we did n't know . 
  not another mega-corporate overblown adshow aka us olympics , thank you . 
  interesting idea , but i just do n't see the point of it . 
  storing hydrogen is a complicated , and we already have a technology for non-diesel fueled trains . 
  it 's called electricity . 
  with all the money required in reseach and development of the hydrogen infastructure , why do n't we just electrify diesel-only lines ? 
  of course , but it still hints that 30 % of the muslim population regard their divine law as a higher authority than the secular law of a country they live in . 
  i highly doubt you would find similar figures within christian populations . 
  high school graduates on a cheap binge-drinking trip , help !, 
  another difference : the arabic world never had an equivalent to the western age of enlightenment . 
  to some extent , it is that period of fundamental philosophcial critique and analysis of religion , divine law and the role of the church within a state that allowed us to develop a concept of a secular society . 
  a society , that accepts a secular morale and nation despite ( still ) being largely religious , even if those two systems of belief may occasionally clash . 
  religion as the glue of a nation or as a final ethic authority is not needed anymore . 
  in the arabic world , a similar process never happened and concepts like atheism never developed . 
  a * meisterbrief * gives you the right to apply for certain college programmes related to your line of work . 
  that implies that a journeyman certificate is not on the same level as a measly university bachelor . 
  the * linke * , yes , is the legal successor to the former gdr communist party , but their policies nowadays are more sort of-mildly socialist . 
  they just managed to keep their role as the main progressive party in the former east . 
  what about lulu ? 
  enrique had a few hits during the latin craze around the millenium , julio has been a big name ( amongst the easy listening crowd , at least ) for decades . 
  this is him at 1970 eurovision : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-ardr61umw, 
  german music peaked in the 19th century . 
  since then , oh boy ... modern f ***** g talking . 
  well , at least not nena . 
  if iglesias , then julio . 
  most eu members now have had influential right-wing/nationalist parties for decades , germany did n't - you know , that whole topic is a bit more diffucult here . 
  it actually was sort of a source of pride and reputation - `` we have no nationalists . '', 
  well , that 's over now , and leads us into a situation that 's new to us . 
  they 're not the first ever far-right party . 
  but most popped up and vanished into obscurity rather quickly . 
  the afd , however , looks like they 're about to stay . 
  london 's status as a worldwide and no. 1 european financial hub is one of the few assets the uk has . 
  access to the common market , english language , corporate-friendly legislation . 
  take away that , and what else does the uk have ? 
  a few remnants from the industrial era in the north and the midlands ? 
  oh yeah , the horrible prospect of mcdonalds scaling back operations within the eu . 
  go ahead vestager , we 're on to something here . 
  queue allegations of vote fraud , the * l\u00fcgenpresse * and mutterings about a left-green mainstream . 
  if you fundamentally differ from an accepted mainstream across ** all ** other major parties and a big chunk of the general population , you can make that argument . 
  they have libertarian elements ( lower taxes , less business regulations etc. 
  ) , but are n't social policy-right wing or neo-con . 
  ** 589 days ** . 
  in the midst of the global economic crisis . 
  unlike switzerland ( a multi-ethnicity nation that does work ) , parties do not operate on a national level . 
  both flanders and wallonia have their own , regional parties which leads to a very fragmented parliament . 
  queue the * stolen car * jokes . 
  seriously , how the hell did this only come 2nd . 
  canada has already brought back bobby clarke to prevent anything like this . 
  vanek and draisatil , watch out . 
  that 's an innate reflex . 
  fall into an katatonic state whenever you hear words like `` ballpark '' and `` shortstop '' , otherwise you would go full ` murican .
