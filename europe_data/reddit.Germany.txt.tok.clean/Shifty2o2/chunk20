  in fact i like the greek alot but if someone like you tries to personally insult me i tend to make an exception and not like that person . 
  by effectively trying to call me a nazi/bashing my english/calling me dipshit ( real mature man ) you surely have shown how friendly you can be . 
  i know it 's hard to understand for you . 
   i thought it was a legit but misinterpreted video . 
  did you shift again ? 
  i know right ? 
  that 's about the most action you 'll ever get though :(, 
  how does it feel to be wrong ? 
  again ? 
  yeah like corruption and tax evasion . 
  yes absolutely . 
  i love me some pathetic desperate people . 
  does it really matter ? 
  the point was that german journalism on that topic was bullshit . 
  either way . 
  also even if it was real , it was from 2013 and varoufakis was n't even in a political position back then . 
  if it helps to ease the tensions between greek and german people i 'm all for it . 
  screw those shady journalists . 
  it 's funny because i feel the exact same way about you . 
  amen brother . 
  von wegen means something along the lines of `` as if '' . 
  we germans use that saying in a context when someone makes a statement and you do n't believe it . 
  you say `` von wegen '' or `` as if '' ( e.g. 
  : `` as if this video was a fake ! '' ), 
  the guy works for bild as i recall and he still is n't convinced . 
  hope i could clear that up . 
  finally someone called bild out for their bullshit `` journalism '' . 
  i love it !, 
  jan b\u00f6hmermann is a legend . 
  you too , mate . 
  you too . 
  hold on to your opinion that is forged by greek tabloids and mad tv . 
  i had a good chuckle talking to you . 
  wo n't even bother reading this . 
  i know i 'm right . 
  unless you come up with sources saying my statements are wrong . 
  which you ca n't . 
  i 've got actual facts that contribute to the original topic instead of an opinion on some random internet stranger that i need to insult to feel on par . 
  greece tried to ** scam ** the eu with a vaguely written application for more aid which ( i believe it was ) djisselbloem found out . 
  ** fact ** . 
  greece had several oppprtunities to make alternative offers to austerity and they did n't come up with anything but a failed scam . 
  in fact the meetings were postponed for weeks to give greece time . 
  ** fact ** . 
  greece has forged their way into the eu with false numbers in the first place . 
  ** fact ** . 
  corruption and tax evasion have n't changed at all . 
  ** fact ** . 
  theres plenty more i suggest you stop reading greek tabloids and do some actual research my sweet little english alumni . 
  how does it feel to be wrong the whole time ? 
  it 's funny that you still try to attack me without coming up with facts and reason . 
  golden . 
  what a twist . 
  which also shows that we germans have a sense of humour . 
   80 police men attacked with acid . 
  what the hell ? 
  is this for real ? 
  shhh do n't call it troika anymore . 
  you might hurt feelings . 
  well if you give me the best replies to ridicule you even more ... why not ? 
  i rather have serious conversations but thats not possible with people like you . 
  i couldnt care less about you . 
  thats why i wont repeat myself for you . 
  simple as that . 
  oh i guess the scamming fact hit a nerve again . 
  must be hard to realize your government consists of a bunch of disrespectful , incompetend brats . 
  feel free to read my other reasonable conversations with people worth debating with . 
  i 'm far from being wrong . 
  but someone as stubborn as you will never understand . 
  also for not knowing which facts i was talking about you seem to have a strong opinion that those facts must be wrong . 
  you 're ridiculous . 
  edit : one fact that i even told you was that greece tried to scam the eu on austerity measures . 
  i remember you being really butthurt over that fact . 
  you might want to read up on that topic . 
  and you might not want to use greek tabloids . 
  yeah i might confuse it with some other conversation . 
  but i 'm not going to discuss any further . 
  especially with a person who shows no respect and tries to attack me personally . 
  you 've got that in common with varoufakis btw . 
  i make a strict distinction between my opinion and my facts . 
  and i gave you both . 
  the facts are correct though . 
  opinions are opinions . 
  and since you have n't called me out on those facts i 'm sure you realized they are indeed correct . 
  only explanation that makes sense why you would try to attack me for typos in a language which is n't even my own . 
  pretty poor . 
  but cheap shots seem to be the way to go when you ca n't come up with facts and reason anymore . 
   speaks volumes about your english proficiency you wrote volume ** s ** not me . 
  you are better off starting to care about the factual stuff and stop being a grammar nazi because i mixed up greece and greek twice lol . 
  because i 'm clearly in the right here . 
  i have facts you 've got 2 typos by me . 
  have a good one . 
  sadly , the things i just said are n't as false as you would like them to be . 
  i got most of that of several sources nationally and internationally . 
  also french news sources by the way . 
  because instead of reading bild like you accused me of i 'd rather watch some credible news channels or browse international news sources . 
  i also know that germany has not signed that treaty because of lobby pressure which i think is horrible . 
  the worst thing about governments nowadays is that they are less powerful than the corporations . 
  but that 's not exclusive to germany and i would love to change that if i knew how . 
  i also realize how much germany profits off of the euro and again it 's not only germany that profits . 
  the sad truth is that this issue was never a matter of elections in germany .
