peanutbutter jelly sandwich and stuff like that , nothing with actual meat oo, 
  yes he invented the screen, 
  so wikipedia ist lying !, 
  so [ this ] ( https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/base_system.png ) stuff ? 
  and i do n't ? 
  as i sayed i do n't watch game of thrones in ov, 
  true but i would n't consider harry potter or dr. 
  strange british either ... 
  not in ov no , they 're changed the names from the book in the ov version that really bothered me in the first season so i 'm watching the german dub, 
  my comment was like `` wow this high numbers in every country ( even my own ) are surprisingly high '' you then make an obvious statement about italy and i responded to that that i 'm aware of the reasons , but still these numbers are pretty high . 
  like wtf are you talking about ? 
  what in my comment made you think i was referring italy for god sake ? 
  breaking news : not everybody is talking about italy . 
  the highest one is 56 % in slovakia, 
  yeah i like american english more it 's easier to understand then any of the brits accents ( imho ) . 
  but after all maybe it 's just because we 're used to american english from school/movies/series . 
  the only series i 'm watching in british was sherlock . 
  did you just assume how european i am based on my location ? 
  *** triggered ***, 
   does the complicated `` dating rules '' that we have america exists ? 
  well , maybe i 'm the only one , but what rules do you mean by that ? 
  the male has to pay ? 
  can confirm , is n't a thing in niedersachsen we just stare at each other and on our phones . 
  well someone has to say it so : good weed in the netherlands , really appreciate that , also they 're language is really nice we often say it 's sounds like german + english + lots of alkohol mixed together . 
  austria has good schnitzel with tunke ( my smartphone do n't like this word ) switzerland has all the money . 
  also they 're hosting cool things like cern without them we would not have things like websites !, 
  belgium ... well does n't really know much about it only heard about there capital . 
  france and germany been through some tough history , but lately work really well together , but i still hear many stereotypes about france and many jokes , but mostly from older people ( 40-50 + ) . 
  same goes for poland , but since pis is in charge there it 's getting tough again politically . 
  denmark , well kopenhagen is a really great city , also we always hear that denmark is the happiest country on earth and they have an excellent social system . 
  luxembourg , well ... small switzerland i guess . 
  and last but not least the czechs , do n't hear much about them in the media , but as far as i seen the people on this sub they seem really nice so i guess everything is fine between us , 
   germany got many beers , but i 've heard belgian ones are still better *** triggered ***, 
  without a flair it 's hard to tell so ... are you german ? 
  lol that 's ironic was n't it a pole who invented the tv ? 
  [ well , born in poland/lived in germany ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_gottlieb_nipkow ), 
  electro as a whole genre , not only techno i would say, 
  gender pay gap is n't so black and white in germany , often they just sum up all money women make vs all money men make . 
  for new employed the gap is n't as big , and often attributable to more aggressive wage negotiations by men ( cause after all if you 're signing to work for tiny amount of money , it 's your own fault or lack on self confidence ) . 
  and which parent stays at home is , as far as i see it in my social bubble , based on who has the higher income , in fact my stepfather stayed 3 years at home as my sister was born , cause he had fewer income plus shittier working hours . 
   downvote is n't a `` dislike '' button . 
  on this sub it is , sadly . 
  oh wow it was late i guessed that 's why i did n't guessed the obvious kokaine reference ... 
  thanks for sharing , awesome name !, 
  stay away from kokaine it 's expensive af, 
  well i did n't see that correlation at first , shame on me it was late . 
  but even if you 're unemployed your country should provide you a free flat , that 's what i knew from germany / denmark/austria etc. 
  but rly just was surprised it 's as high as 50 %, 
  yeah i guessed it has a correlation with the unemployment map for 18-30 years old , but still : just very strange to me that it 's as high as 50 %, 
  wow that 's really surprising ... never thought there would be countries where 50 % + are still living with there parents ... 
  if not worse ... 
  haha that 's probably cause we want to smoke weed there :p, 
   wtf is an apfelschorle ? 
  disgusting shit which combines the worst of sparkling water and apple juice . 
  i do n't get why anyone would like this as it tastes like sparkling urine ... 
  i have to ask this : what the fuck is a `` staubsauger nase '' ? 
  is it the size , form or how fast you can suck a tennisball through your nose ? 
  english , german had 4 years of french in school , but really do n't remember anything at all but how to say my name/where i 'm from ... also : c , java , javascript , python , visualbasic , getting used to rust as well, 
  i e s g p. . . hm i was hoping for a hidden word there :(, 
  you 're right but to be fair : not all people can do that . 
  i 've seen some very strange behavior from tourists ... 
  are you a german shepherd ? 
  maybe then youtube trends would be worth a look again ... 
  no why ? 
  rewe , edeka , netto are more common . 
  so you 're saying that in poland you only have global grocery stores , no locals ? 
  maybe it 's time then for a local shop if the demand is so high in your country . 
  if it 's successfull you can expand to the rest of the world . 
  that 's how globalization works, 
  wtf ? 
  we had a wal mart in my home city , does n't know that this means we 're invaded by the us ... you can buy asian cars here , guess that means we 're invaded from asia too . 
  i mean wtf ? 
  why would everyone else in the eu want a member to fail ? 
  it would have an negative impact on the hole eu, 
  oh sure sorry for me it 's linked to my past sorry . 
  nice to hear that they 're still airing and making new episodes !, 
  lol you know why i 'm making these two ? 
  to seperaten them from the rest , where did you see me generalize for all new members wtf ? 
  it was called `` die sendung mit der maus '' ( the program with the mouse ), 
  i doubt it was actual guns , cause that would be a very serious crime here . 
  but `` schreckschusspistolen '' ( blank gun ) are pretty common for silvester , maybe it was just this ? 
  `` mass rape '' ... lol ... 
  i heard it was last night in sweden ? 
  so sad . 
  you know that the japanese government already statet an capitulation , but us just wanted to test the real madness of they 're mass destruct weapons ... 
  so yeah it was a big war crime for me, 
  at least you have someone to chat with d :, 
  you 're welcome  literally , you can always visit the countries in the eu :d, 
   because never , not for a single second you stop and think you could be wrong ... hm ... maybe you are the one that should consider being wrong here ? 
  the eu is a huge democracy , it has to listen to sooo many different people and of cause not all agree with it . 
  but democracy is always a compromise and i think that eu is a good one for every member . 
  but yeah simplistic and populism hate of it cause `` i hate you cause duh '' is always a good way to make things better, 
   [ ... ] and they are now proud of their countries . 
  in fact : yes . 
  that 's the problem they 're not just proud , they 're proud and dicks . 
  pis and orban are just this : dicks . 
  you can be proud without say fuck you to everyone else . 
  i was n't implying you do , just want to say that he is and will be the main reason why turkey at it current status do n't fit in the eu : / unfortunately , i think otherwise we would be glad to have you here, 
  well as long as erdogan is in charge i do n't think turkey meets the requirements for the eu at all . 
  he always reminds me of trump , lying about everything , rule the country like a dictator and even wants to make death sentence a thing ... that alone would disqualify the turkey from joining,
