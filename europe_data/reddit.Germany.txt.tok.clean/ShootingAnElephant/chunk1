who were they supposed to support ??? 
  the best thing would have been not to get involved at all . 
  the war was started by iraq with the intend to conquer iranian oil fields but in the end the only results were millions dead and billions in economic demages for both sides . 
  no territorial gains were made , it was all for nothing . 
  the us supported iraq during the iran-iraq war , which was clearly a mistake , but the relations after the war , especially after the iraqi invasion of kuwait , deteriorated rapidly . 
  but any support by the us does n't make the crimes of saddam hussain less atrocious . 
  at what point am i defending the actions of the west ? 
  i am just pointing out that however brutal isis is , saddam hussain can barely be considered a `` lesser evil '' . 
  whatever the west may have done , it is irrelevant to the crimes saddam hussein has committed . 
  tu quoque is not a valid argument in this matter . 
  regarding the sanctions i would like to make several points ( although i think the sanctions were wrong ) : * the sanctions were a reaction to the aggressions and crimes of the iraqi regime * most estimates put the number of deaths at arround 500,000 ( which still is an appalling amount ) * humanitarian goods such as medicine and food were excluded from the sanctions, 
  you mean the guy who is responsible for the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of kurds ( see : [ al-anfal campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-anfal_campaign ) and [ 1991 uprisings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_iraq ) ) and other dissidents amounting to possibly a million of his own [ people he killed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_saddam_hussein%27s_iraq ) ? 
  the guy who started two illegal wars , one against kuwait and one against [ iran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran%e2%80%93iraq_war ) , the latter of them kiling more than a million people ? 
  the guy , whose henchmen decimated entire villages using [ poison gas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction ) ? 
  isis is probably the most horrific terrorist organization in existence at the moment , but as far as genocidal maniacs go saddam plays in a different league . 
  where am i engaging in revisionism ? 
  the war was started by germany , the most horrific crimes were committed by germany . 
  the entire german state and large parts of the population have made themselves very guilty , be it through inaction or outright support . 
  i certainly wo n't dispute that . 
  yet i can not see how `` not all germans were nazis and deserved their livelihood to be destroyed '' is a controversial or even revisionist statement . 
  i would ' t say that . 
  in 1932 33.1 % voted nsdap and a further 8.3 % voted dnvp , a nationalistic party ideologically close to the nazis . 
  nationalistic and anti-semetic sentiments were probably shared by an even larger share of the population . 
  ignoring the long-term socio-economic and political developments in germany the immediate factors , besides his relative popularity , that enabled hitler to seize power were the polarized and ineffective opposition ( divided between social democrats and communists ) and a flaw in the constitution . 
  the president was allowed to appoint the chancellor , dissolve parliament and issue legally binding emergency decrees ( which were supposed to be controlled by the parliament ) thus giving him quasi dictatorial power . 
  under the weimar constitution the office of chancellor was not elected by the people but appointed by the president , so hitler was technically never elected . 
  he was appointed because the nsdap got the most votes ( 33.1 % ) in the election in november 1932 and the conservatives thought he would be easy to control . 
  technically the government needed the approval of parliament but in the last years of the republic the parliament was too divided to agree on a govenment so instead the president would dissolve the paliament and would pass the governments proposed laws as emergency decrees . 
  although i agree with you on the issue , the picture you linked shows a ballot for the referendum on the unification of germany and austria and not for hitlers election as chancellor , which was 5 years earlier . 
   which they were . 
  hitler was democratically elected . 
  germans loved him as long as he provided new lands and free slave labourers . 
  saying hitler was democratically elected is technically not correct or at least significantly distorts the facts . 
  it would be more fitting to say he was appointed in accordance with the weimar constitution . 
  in the last democratic election of the reichstag in 1932 the nsdap received 33.1 % ( 4.2 % less than in the previous election ) of the vote . 
  the president paul von hindenburg then appointed hitler as chancellor at the behest of consevatives and industrialists , who thought he would be easy to control . 
  that obviously turned out to be wrong . 
   cry me a river . 
  you play with fire and you get burnt individual responsibility ? 
  rule of law ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  you are using the same logic , with which dictatorships justify collective punishments against perceived enemies . 
  of course the german public shares a tremendous amount of blame for the crimes of national socialism . 
  but you are just taking the opposite extreme . 
  instead of saying `` almost no german was a real nazi '' you are saying `` all germans were nazis '' . 
  the people , who were focibly driven from their homes were often ordinary people , whose families lived there for generations . 
  definitely . 
  unless you specifically call for criminal acts or discrimination against a religious group you should n't be punished . 
  it is important that you are allowed to criticize or even mock a religion . 
  article 5 of the german constitution protects freedom of speech . 
  it reads as follows :  ( 1 ) every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech , writing and pictures , and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources . 
  freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed . 
  there shall be no censorship . 
    ( 2 ) these rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws , in provisions for the protection of young persons , and in the right to personal honour . 
    ( 3 ) arts and sciences , research and teaching shall be free . 
  the freedom of teaching shall not release any person from allegiance to the constitution . 
  as you might have guessed from section ( 2 ) , freedom of speech in germany is n't defined as an absolute right as it is for example in the united states . 
  and indeed there are certain limitations on free speech . 
  the most obvious one is the prohibition of holocaust denial . 
  holocaust denial is mostly prosecuted based on \u00a7 130 of the german penal code , which criminalizes `` volksverhetzung '' ( incitement of the people ) . 
  acts punished under that law are : inciting hatred against a national , racial , religious group and downplaying , glorifying or denying national socialist rule and crimes . 
  there is also \u00a7 166 , which is often called `` blasphemy paragraph '' . 
  it criminalizes the defamation of religious denominations in a manner `` that is suitable to disturb the public peace '' . 
  there are about 15 convictions each year . 
  after the attack on charlie hebdo there have been calls to abolish this paragraph but as far as i am aware there have n't been any real initiatives in parliament to actually do that . 
  other than that there are a number of laws that punish acts such as libel but most countries have laws like that . 
  my personal opinion on this issue is that laws like this were desperately needed in the years after wwii , when german society and government were still undermined by many former nazis but by now german civil society is strong enough . 
  the only speech that should be criminalized , is speech that directly hurts other people , such as libel or incitement to criminal acts . 
   yes it had been going on for a while , but the `` wilkommen '' signs were just like throwing gasoline on a small brush fire that is just incorrect . 
  if you look at the [ graph in the top right corner ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) you 'll see that by 2014 asylum applications in the eu were allready surpassing 500,000 with a tendency to increase . 
   well , if someone decides to burn down his 1st floor apartment and it burns your 2nd floor , that guy can take the hoa paper and say `` we need to rebuild , and this says you need to pay for it too '' . 
  the 2nd floor will tell him to fuck off and pay for it or else he will sue his ass into the poorhouse . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  first of all these refugees did n't `` burn down [ the ] first floor apartment '' ( which i assume symbolizes the refugees ' countries of origin ) . 
  they are not responsible for the civil war in syria , in iraq or afghanistan . 
  secondly they also did n't burn down the 2nd floor ( which i assume symbolizes europe ) . 
  sure , there are logistical restrictions and our shelters are reaching the limits of their capacity but these issues mostly affect the refugees themselves . 
  also we are n't paying to rebuild syria but taking in refugees , to which we are mandated , and i do n't know whether i said this often enough , by intenational law . 
   the volume really started to pick up once the eastern route ( turkey ) was secured and encouraged by germany there is a steady increase in asylum application since 2011/2012 , correlating with the war in syria and the rise of isis . 
  there may have been an increase in asylum applications to germany recently but that 's just following a general trend . 
  i was not talking about germany specifically but about the entirety of europe . 
  for example countries like greece or italy might not feel `` morally obligated '' to take in refugees , but they are legally obligated . 
  also it should be noted that refugees from syria , iraq and afghanistan were an issue way before germans started taking selfies with `` willkommen '' signs . 
  the power of christ compels you !, 
  get that away from me !, 
  i hope he knows that in many cases we are mandated by [ international law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) to take in refugees at least until their status can be decided . 
  elton john already started to wonder whether the real putin would admit to being gay and liking [ `` long big cocks '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1d7llx4rm8 ), 
  so this is not part of the islamization of europe and the subsequent introduction of shariah law ? 
  what am i now supposed to do with my pitchfork ? 
  that 's the daily mail for you . 
  fair enough, 
  so brave . 
  the problem still stand as it is . 
  assad has only been able to offer some resistance to isis because of the massive support he receives from russia and iran . 
  the kurds have only been able to defend their territory because of the air support they receive from the anti isis coalition . 
  without these outside interventions isis would seemingly win . 
  so what if anything would you do about that ? 
   in my opinion civil wars should be settled within the borders , between the conflicting fractions . 
  allowing the most popular or the most powerful domestic party to emerge . 
  in the case of syria that would be isis .
