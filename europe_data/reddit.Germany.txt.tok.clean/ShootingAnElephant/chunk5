  isds will protect companies against the following infringements : * discrimination * expropriation of foreign investments without compensation * denial of justice to foreign investors in domestic courts * abusive or arbitrary treatment of eu and us investors in each other 's territory . 
  you are really distorting the facts . 
   the deal benefits companies at the cost of customers and nations on both sides . 
  first of all ttip does n't exist yet so we can not really say whether it will be a good or bad deal though economists [ overwhelmingly agree ] ( http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?surveyid=sv_0dfr9yjndclh17m ) that free trade is a net positive . 
   the negotiations are also run without any oversight from parliaments as are all international negotitions . 
  negotiations would be impossible to conclude if each national parliament would be able to make amendments , which then in turn would have to be agreed upon by the other parliaments . 
  also everything during the negotiations is subject to change so it would n't help them deciding on whether the final agreement will be good or bad . 
  most importantly though : the final agreement will have to be ratified by 30 different parliaments ( parliaments of eu-members + european parliament + us congress ) . 
  you can not really say there are n't enough democratic checks . 
  i really would n't know . 
  it might take a year from now , might take two or possibly more . 
  ttip is still subject to negotiation . 
  some of the eu negotiating documents are public but the final agreement is n't ( because it does n't exist yet ) . 
  the tpp on the other hand has recently been agreed upon and now will have to be ratified . 
   deal is n't public yet , it will be in a few weeks are you possibly confusing ttip and tpp or have i missed something ? 
  not really . 
  companies can sue for compensation if they think their rights have been violated . 
  the rights protected under current us agreements are as follows : 1 . 
  ** freedom from discrimination ** : an assurance that americans doing business abroad will face a level playing field and will not be treated less favorably than local investors or competitors from third countries . 
  ** protection against uncompensated expropriation of property ** : an assurance that the property of investors will not be seized by the government without the payment of just compensation . 
  ** protection against denial of justice ** : an assurance that investors will not be denied justice in criminal , civil , or administrative adjudicatory proceedings . 
  ** right to transfer capital ** : an assurance that investors will be able to move capital relating to their investments freely , subject to safeguards to provide governments flexibility , including to respond to financial crises and to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system ( [ source ] ( https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/fact-sheets/2015/march/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds# ) ) the eu goals for isds under ttip are [ similiar ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/html/153018.htm ) . 
  it is also important to remember that you can always sue but winning is a completely different thing . 
  companies can already sue governments in national courts but might fear that those are biased in favour of their own country . 
  isds exists as an assurance to investors that their cases will be treated without bias and thus encourage investment . 
  the richest and poorest cities defined by what measurement ? 
  is there any basis to believe this ? 
  people that have been tortured were people accused of terrorrism . 
  the american government denied them due process by classifying them as `` enemy combatants '' . 
  also most of them were relatively unknown . 
  they have no incentive to torture and kill snowden nor any reason to think they could get away with it . 
  while france ran a budget deficit of 4 % of the gdp in 2014 and germany had a budget surplus of 0.7 % with a gdp growth of 1.6 % compared to frances 0.4 % . 
  i would n't expect the poverty rate to stay that low with further budget cuts . 
  i could n't find the most recent data but in 2013 14 % were living below the poverty line in france , compared to 15,5 % in germany . 
  i am not trying to defend every aspect of the aganda 2010 but a walfare state is n't sustainable if the economy is n't able to support it . 
  and right now france has for example an unemployment rate of 10.5 % whereas the unemployment rate in germany is only 4.7 % . 
  true but the german economy turned out so well , partly because of the `` agenda 2010 '' reform programm , which featured deregulations and welfare cuts . 
  i think most streets in germany are just named after their surroundings . 
  as such you get a lot of names like `` bergstra\u00dfe '' ( mountain street ) , `` rosenstra\u00dfe '' ( rose street ) or `` eichenweg '' ( oak tree way ) . 
  there are also a lot of streets named after different cities . 
  most streets that are named after people , are named after artists . 
  `` schillerstra\u00dfe '' , `` goethestra\u00dfe '' and `` richard-wagner-stra\u00dfe '' seem to be among the most common ones . 
  you 'll also find a lot of streets named after politicians , mostly from germanys democratic periods , for obvious reasons . 
  `` friedrich-ebert-stra\u00dfe '' ( named after the first president of the weimar republic ) is very common . 
  a lot of streets have been renamed to avoid associations with militarism . 
  but there are some odd one outs . 
  you will still find the occasional `` bismarckstra\u00dfe '' and in my hometown specifically there is a `` werner-vo\u00df-stra\u00dfe '' and a `` emil-sch\u00e4fer-stra\u00dfe '' , both named after wwi flying aces . 
  used to be ? 
  how dare you insult our glorious chancellor like that ? 
  look at [ this ] ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-27550-panov9-sifh.jpg ) and tell me honestly you are n't at least somwhat aroused !, 
  although in hindsight we can say that the invasion of iraq was most probably a mistake i do n't think one can easily say that life under saddam hussein was that much better , at least for the majority of people.the guy is responsible for the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of kurds ( see : [ al-anfal campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-anfal_campaign ) and [ 1991 uprisings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_uprisings_in_iraq ) ) and other dissidents amounting to possibly a million of his own [ people he killed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_saddam_hussein%27s_iraq ) . 
  he started two illegal wars , one against kuwait and one against [ iran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran%e2%80%93iraq_war ) , the latter of them kiling more than a million people . 
  his henchmen decimated entire villages using [ poison gas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction ) . 
  isis is the most horrific terrorist organization in existence today , but as far as genocidal maniacs go , saddam is in a different league . 
  while assad is a moderate in the sense that the courts in syria rely mostly on secular laws and religious freedom is mostly guaranteed , there is no doubt that the iranian regime is highly sectarian and does n't agree with the syrian system of government . 
  just look at the crimes commited by shiite militias , funded and trained by iran , in iraq . 
  iran is allied to assad to project power in the region and use syria as a supply line to support hezbolla , an islamist organization . 
  the word `` god '' is only used at two points in the constitution and at no point with regards to the structure of the state . 
  it 's used in the preamble :  conscious of their responsibility before ** god ** and man , inspired by the determination to promote world peace as an equal partner in a united europe , the german people , in the exercise of their constituent power , have adopted this basic law . 
  and in the oath of office of the bundespr\u00e4sident ( federal president ) :  i swear that i will dedicate my efforts to the well-being of the german people , promote their welfare , protect them from harm , uphold and defend the basic law and the laws of the federation , perform my duties conscientiously , and do justice to all . 
  so help me ** god ** . 
  but only with the added clarification that the oath can be said without the religious affirmation . 
  or maybe some of us think we should help our fellow human beings if we are capable of doing so . 
  nah , it 's probably just white guilt . 
  what is hyperinflation ? 
  it 's headlines like these that make me really appreciate that we do n't elect judges . 
  legally they are the same . 
   wages for 90 % of the population have been stagnating despite economic growth and have even decreased for the poorest 10 % . 
  you 've got a source for this claim ? . 
  real wages have [ grown ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/wage-growth ) in the last two years but i could n't find a statistic broken down by income groups . 
  do you have an example for when he did that ? 
  debt in absolute terms is meaningless . 
  you need to look at the debt/gdp or interest payments/gdp ratio and on those terms the us is doing alright . 
  maybe it 's his comments on bringing back torture worse than waterboarding , killing the families of terrorists and introducing a national stop and frisk policy that sound at least a bit fascist-y to some people . 
  they were n't even really anti-eu , mostly just anti-euro . 
  and indeed the only way we 're legally allowed to . 
  everything else would be considered a misdemeanour and fined . 
   where does that put me ? 
  in a very small minority . 
  but i agree with you , in times of increased surveillance and security measures , burka bans and other forms of paternalism it would be nice to have a liberal voice on the national level . 
  yeah , i think these kinds of laws were necessary in the immediate aftermath of wwii as at that point the entire german state apparatus was still undermined by former nazis and nazi collaborators . 
  now nazis are a very small minority that is shunned by the rest of the population . 
  it should be noted however that they do n't ban a belief . 
  it 's perfectly legal to be antisemitic in your own home and decorate it with as many swastikas as you want . 
  there are some basics of constitutional law you should know first : most rights guaranteed by the grundgesetz can be found in articles 1-19 . 
  each right covers a certain set of persons ( most protect all persons , some only german citizens , some are also applicable to corporations and organisations ) and actions , combined they are referred to as the `` schutzbereich '' ( scope of protection ) . 
  all rights can be subject to infringements ( provided they are justified ) with human dignity , which under no circumstances may be infringed upon , being the exception . 
  to be justified the purpose the infringement must fall within the designated restrictions ( schranken ) . 
  there are basically three kinds of restrictions rights may be subject to : * verfassungsimmanente schranke : restrictions imminently provided by the constitution . 
  rights may only be restricted based on colliding constitutional law . 
  * allgemeiner gesetzesvorbehalt : the right is under reservation of statutory powers , and may be restricted by any law * qualifizierter gesetzesvorbehalt : the right is under a qualified reservation of statutory powers , and may be restricted by any law , that meets the additional requirements provided by the respective article if a right is restricted the restricting law is in turn subject to restrictions on the restrictions ( schranken-schranken ) , most importantly proportionality , which necessitates that the infringement is the least-restrictive means with the same efficacy to fulfil the purpose freedom of religion is protected by article 4 section ( 1 ) and ( 2 )  ** article 4 **  [ freedom of faith and conscience ]  ( 1 ) freedom of faith and of conscience , and freedom to profess  a religious or philosophical creed , shall be inviolable . 
   ( 2 ) the undisturbed practice of religion shall be guaranteed . 
   ( 3 ) no person shall be compelled against his conscience to  render military service involving the use of arms . 
  details shall be regulated by a federal law . 
  the scope of protection of this right includes every person and protects the freedom to profess and exercise your religious beliefs . 
  this includes the ability adopt a belief ( forum internum ) as well as to openly profess your belief and live according to its rules including religious celebrations and so on ( forum externum ) . 
  the full extent of the scope of protection is thus determined by the individual beliefs of the person . 
  acts that violate the rights of others in the name of religion ( like honour killings ) are exempt . 
  as the word `` inviolable '' indicates there is no reservation of statutory powers and thus freedom of religion can only be restricted by conflicting constitutional law . 
  one often mentioned possibility is the protection of human dignity from article 1 of the basic law .
