  is there any solid evidence that the burka substantially increases security risk , not only in theory but has demonstrably done so in the past ? 
  i very firmly believe in the idea that individual rights may only be restricted to prevent infringements on the rights of others . 
  the burden to ban behaviour that does n't even infringe on other rights but merely increases the risk of future infringement i consider to be even higher . 
  just starting to preemptively restrict right based on unsubstantiated fear is a step towards authoritarianism and i find it worrisome that some people here seem to approve of such steps . 
  are you talking about [ oskar dirlewanger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oskar_dirlewanger ) ? 
  probably one of the most disgusting human beings to ever live on this planet . 
  considering that from their point of view almost every person , they 're dealing with , could potentially have a gun it 's somewhat understandable . 
  police officers in europe do n't have to worry about that unless they are dealing with organised crime . 
  this is [ hardly unexpected ] ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-euro--monetary-unity-to-political-disunity ) . 
  i personally think this is deeply worrying . 
  this attack could have just as well been perpetrated by a german extremist but instead we have to import cheap racists from abroad !, 
  with regards to what ? 
  most of this is pretty basic stuff . 
  the idea that you ca n't be required to flee has been established by the reichsgericht ( highest court of the weimar republic ) and reaffirmed by the federal court of justice ( bgh ) on several occasions , for example in bgh 4 str 551/12 . 
  this case also established the position of the bgh that your self defence action has to be primarily motivated by the will to defend yourself , which is somewhat controversial . 
  only having to use a more lenient defensive action if you can be sure that it will reliably stop the attack has been affirmed in bgh 2 str 375/11 . 
  as i said the only thing that could be problematic in this case is whether the attack was imminent or not when the driver ran the guy with the machete over . 
  i 've already wrote a bit about self-defence law in germany [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4tr9yd/germans_should_be_prepared_for_further_attacks/d5jp63p ) . 
   the right of self defence is quite extensive in german law , probably as extensive as any `` stand-your-ground '' law in the us . 
   the relevant law in this case is n't the basic law but \u00a7 32 of the stgb ( german criminal code ) , which reads as follows :   ( 1 ) a person who commits an act in self-defence does not act unlawfully . 
   ( 2 ) self-defence means any defensive action that is necessary to avert an imminent unlawful attack on oneself or another . 
    there are three components to self defence :   first the *** notwehrlage *** ( self defence situation ) , which describes the conditions under which self defence might be used . 
  as the law says self defence requires an `` imminent unlawful attack ''   * ** attack ** : any endangerment of legally protected interests ( life , liberty and physical integrety are the most important ones in this case ) through human behaviour   * ** imminent ** : about to happen or in progress   * ** unlawful ** : if the attack is against the legal order and the attacked does not need to tolerate it . 
  the attacker does not act justified himself   secondly the ** notwehrhandlung ** ( self defence act ) . 
  the action must be both necessary as well as `` geboten '' ( i could n't find a fitting translation )   * ** necessity ** :  1 . 
  the action must be able to stop the attacker ( it is sufficient if the action would at least make it more difficult to continue the attack )  1 . 
  of all the means that are available to you to defend yourself you must choose ** the most lenient that is still able to stop the attack ** . 
  if there are more lenient means available to you but it is doubtful they can stop the attack , you do n't need to use them . 
   it should be noted that you also can not be required to take `` shameful flight '' because if you 're defending yourself against an unlawful attack you are defending the entire legal order . 
  granted , that 's a bit melodramatic but you get the idea . 
  restrictions may apply when dealing with a child or mentally incapable person . 
    * ** gebotenheit ** describes various restrictions that may apply based on various social and ethical considerations . 
  for example you might not use an action that would be extremely disproportional like shooting someone to prevent someone from stealing an apple . 
     there is also a subjective component , the '' ** notwehrwille ** '' ( self defence will )   there is a general consensus that you need to know of the `` notwehrlage '' but the federal court of justice also requires that your self defence action is primarily motivated by the will to defend yourself . 
   all these principles also apply to `` nothilfe '' , which is the defence of another person . 
  the only aspect that might be problematic in this case is `` imminent '' but if the attacker was chasing after other people , the attack would probably still considered to be imminent . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  the right of self defence is quite extensive in german law , probably as extensive as any `` stand-your-ground '' law in the us .

  they are just claiming to combat `` gulenists '' , an obvious excuse to take over the entire state bureaucracy . 
  george osborne after john mcdonnell read from mao 's little red book was pretty good [ banter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbstc3bbuy0 ) , too . 
  i think what she did was wrong but it should be noted that she corrected her story 12 hours after her initial report to the police . 
  i also would ' t expect someone , who has just been raped , to behave rationally so i think this is n't the right occasion to get outraged . 
  of the 21 ultimately tried , only 12 were sentenced to death and 3 were acquitted , so saying they were just an excuse so `` we could go ahead and execute nazis '' is quite hyperbolic . 
  yes , part of the indictment at the nuremberg trials was `` crimes against peace '' . 
  but the nuremberg trials were rather improvised and not really up to the standards of due process we would expect today . 
  you could argue that at the time the severity of nazi crimes and the lack of legal framework for such trials made it permissible to ignore * nulla poena sine lege * but with the much more established legal framework we have today , i do n't think it 's still a valid argument . 
  the iraq war was most probably illegal but there is a difference between the war itself being illegal , and tony blair being guilty of a crime the hague could prosecute . 
  crimes of aggression , the act of waging illegal war , is only a crime under the rome statute since the [ kampala review conference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/review_conference_of_the_rome_statute_of_the_international_criminal_court ) in 2010 , way after the iraq war was started . 
  there should be an investigation into whether coalition troops may have committed war crimes but to sentence tony blair for their actions , you would need to establish that blair had command responsibility for the troops in question , knew of the crimes being committed and did nothing to stop them . 
  well , you always have to remember that there are many people whose lives will be negatively impacted by this , whether they voted for the brexit or not . 
  considering that i think it 's quite hard not to be at least somewhat sympathetic . 
  bavaria is a strong independent freistaat , who do n't need no sauprei\u00dfn !, 
  i 'm worried about the future of the uk but at the same time it 's quite amusing seeing the whole place coming down , in a morbid kind of way . 
  i believe this is how a trump presidency would be like . 
  i think the fact that some people have convinced themselves that memes are a legitimate argument , is one of the greatest threats to the level of our political discourse . 
  women gained suffrage in national elections in 1971 , but in 1991 the canton of appenzell innerrhoden was the last canton to enfranchise women , after being ordered to do so by the federal court . 
  i ca n't even understand why he 's saying it , as if it would undermine our credibility . 
  if there 's someone who could be considered an expert on genocide , it 's us !, 
   misconception that the american civil war had anything to do with the abolishment of slavery the [ top post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3boun3/the_lost_cause_the_american_civil_war_and_the/ ) of all time on / r/badhistory deals with how incredibly wrong that notion is quite comprehensively . 
  more like remove roman . 
  napoleon only jumped on the bandwagon . 
  sharia `` courts '' are just for the arbitration of civil disputes though . 
  they can not , and neither can any other court for that matter , force you to marry someone you do n't want to marry . 
  arbitration rulings may not violate british law and a marriage is only valid if you give notice at a local register office . 
  do n't be sad because it 's over , smile because it happened . 
  - adolf hitler ( i think ), 
  the catholic church in general has been the most important patron of the arts and sciences for a long time in european history . 
  til [ justinian i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justinian_i#/media/file:justinian555ad.png ) did n't exist . 
  christianity was adopted as state religion of the roman empire in 380 and they continued to be a dominant european power for a long time after that . 
  merkel certainly is n't especially conservative . 
  she 's pretty much a center-right pragmatist . 
  if you are less charitable you would probably say opportunist . 
  the article is pretty sparse on details but from what i can tell the judgement is n't final ( though i do n't know how the appeals process works in belgium ) and at least in what is quoted he is n't confessing to personally beheading someone but just saying that the group he was a member of killed someone for `` being a heretic '' . 
  some people here might not see a moral distinction between those two but legally murder , accessory to murder and being a member in are criminal organization very important distinctions . 
  without further details it 's very hard to judge this case but i would , at least for the moment , hold back with the outrage . 
  in the us they also operate as `` trader joe 's '' . 
  the wehrmacht was often directly ( e.g. 
  murder and mistreatment of soviet pows ) or indirectly ( logistical support for ss , orpo , etc. ), 
  complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity and after all it were the conquests of the wehrmacht that enabled the other nazi atrocities so i do n't think there 's a clear moral separation between wehrmacht and ss . 
  i do however agree with your overarching point that it is ridiculous to hold donald tusk responsible for the actions of his grandfather and that the latter did n't have much choice in his being conscripted . 
  ah i see , that makes much more sense !, 
  so you will lose your direct mandate if your party fails to get three others or pass the 5 % threshold ? 
  are you sure about that ? 
  the holocaust is the reason why fascism is completely delegitimised as a political ideology . 
  in almost every instance denial of the holocaust is just an effort to rehabilitate fascism .
