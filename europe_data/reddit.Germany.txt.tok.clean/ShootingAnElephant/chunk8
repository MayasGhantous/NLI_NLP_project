  making a distinction between anti-semitism and holocaust denial is effectively unnecessary . 
   not too sure how i feel about the corporate tax cut as i feel companies should pay more than citizens but if he wants to maintain it at the eu average then i wo n't feel to badly about it . 
  that 's definitely a good policy . 
  corporate taxes are just bad taxes regardless of personal ideology . 
  you need to distinguish between who legally pays the tax and where the tax incidence is , i.e. 
  who actually pays the tax . 
  in the case of corporate taxes a lot of the tax will be passed on to consumers ( through higher prices ) and to labour ( through lower wages ) . 
  the ideal corporate tax rate is zero or pretty close to zero ( see also [ this episode ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate ) of nprs planet money ) if you want rich people to pay more taxes just tax them directly . 
  this is pretty blatant propaganda and poor one at that . 
  the framing makes it seem as if all the acts listed constitute american aggression while in reality some of these operations where un sanctioned . 
  the chart is also overly liberal with what it considers sabotage and government overthrow . 
  some of these operations merely consisted of propaganda efforts and intelligence sharing . 
  at the same time it does n't apply these standards to iranian actions . 
  the numerous assassinations carried out by iranian agents against enemies of the regime , such as the [ assassination of shapour bakthiar in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shapour_bakhtiar#assassination ) and the [ mykonos restaurant assassinations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mykonos_restaurant_assassinations ) in berlin , are conveniently ignored . 
  the same goes for irans support of hezbollah and [ shiite militias ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/19/irans-shiite-militias-are-running-amok-in-iraq/ ) , the latter of which are commiting war crimes in iraq and are a general threat to the stability of the middle east . 
  it is very clear that the us does not have a clean vest and many of the operations listed are genuinely problematic but you can make that case without bullshit like this . 
  sincere belief in a cause does n't make actions committed in pursuit of that cause moral . 
  many nazis firmly believed in assuming their rightful place as the `` master race '' yet , ignoring neo-nazis , nobody would use that to justify their actions . 
  also saying we should n't judge the past by present moral standards makes only really sense when we 're talking about moral concepts that we 're non-existent at that point in time like , say , freedom of religion in medieval europe . 
  however we 're talking about things that have happened in the last 200 years where the fundamental wrongness of killing innocent people was well established . 
  the saudi government does n't consist of ideologues for the most part , they just rule over an extremely conservative population . 
  accordingly they have no problem enforcing very strict religious laws on their own people to gain the favour of the clergy but at the same time are willing to ignore these rules for foreign leaders if it is to their advantage . 
  what many people do n't know about germany is that the coach of the national football team is also ex officio president of the federal assembly . 
  the americans have n't even indicted him so there 's no reason they would request his extradition . 
  and even if they would , why should they torture him ? 
  at most he is a nuisance and with his high public profile torturing him would do more harm than good . 
  the idea that he is at risk of american torture is utterly ridiculous . 
  he 's just a sleazeball with an exaggerated sense of self-importance trying to avoid a lawful investigation . 
  are they though ? 
  the fdp is mostly criticising how disorderly the refugee crisis has been while maintaining a pro-immigration stance . 
  within the greens and die linke it most has been palmer and wagenknecht respectively criticising the refugee policy while most of their parties as a whole are still pretty pro-refugee . 
  some nice buzzwords you 've got there . 
  that 's pure speculation but even if it was n't it 's not the pollsters fault that the voters are idiots . 
  first of all , pollsters do not predict elections , they try to gauge the voting intentions of the public . 
  of those groups that issued predictions , 538 , probably the best of them , gave trump around 30 % , which means his win was considered unlikely yet a distinct possibility . 
  secondly , most people got the outcome of the election wrong due to the peculiarities of the american electoral system , where a few points in key states can completely change the election results . 
  trump needed to overperform by a few percentage points in some key states to win , which is what ultimately happened . 
  le pen needs to bridge a gap of around 20-30 % , which is quite a different thing . 
  the idea that just because people predicted trump to loose , you ca n't trust polls anymore is ridiculous . 
  a party ban includes a ban of successor parties and organisations . 
   i 'll now translate the press release , please give me a moment . 
   i would n't agree it 's slavery in any shape way or form well , call it forced labour then . 
  the fact is that you compel people under threat of punishment to perform an act and potentially risk their lives . 
  that 's forced labour . 
  i mean , he 's an opportunist not an idiot . 
  even if the lower court had ruled that they acted based on antisemitism they would n't have been sentenced to a decade in prison . 
  also they did n't even cause 900eur in damages , 10 years seems quite excessive . 
  terrorism is n't a separate crime in german law . 
  you 're right , it would be nice to have the lower court ruling for context but it does n't seem to be available online . 
  the fact that they have been found guilty seems to invalidate the idea that the lower court considered their actions justified . 
  i also ca n't think of any legal context in which they would use that phrasing , as something being political is n't a legal justification . 
  this article is terrible journalism at best , blatant propaganda at worst , probably both . 
  first of all this decision only concerned an appeal by the prosecution against the sentences , as such it did n't rule one the facts or the guilt of the defendants . 
  those have already been determined by the lower court and had to be accepted . 
  they were both found guilty of attempted aggravated arson . 
  the ruling of the higher court actually revised their sentences upward . 
  secondly at no point in the [ ruling ] ( https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/lgs/wuppertal/lg_wuppertal/j2016/23_ns_50_js_156_14_26_15_urteil_20160118.html ) is the phrase `` justified political speech '' used , that seems to be wholly made up by the author . 
   i just love this mental gymnastics you are performing  two stocks that cross : omg that 's evil . 
  people not showing their face anywhere they go , no matter what security checks they pass : oh that 's okay guys . 
  you are confusing me trying to explain german law to you with me offering moral evaluations of certain religious practices . 
  the constitutional court already ruled in a case concerning freedom of speech that the basic law as a normative order was conceived as the antithesis to nazi ideology and as such offers inherently constitutional restriction on the basis of which a ban on nazi symbols can be justified . 
  as i explained we do n't have an equivalent of conflicting constitutional law , on the basis of which we could justify a general ban on face covering . 
   nazi religion is simply an ideology . 
  and ideas never really hurt or infringe the freedom of others . 
  and for the evils of the nazi ideology , i am sure you will find muslims or xtians that hold the same evil ideas : kill jews , gays etc. 
  or maybe you claim that no such person exists in germany . 
  that 's why i wrote `` practices '' not `` beliefs ''  no . 
  because as you claim , before any action is taken , the govt has to consider if it impacts any religion and the right of those people who practice that religion . 
  that 's a procedural issue . 
  as there is no realistic possibility of nazis suing the government for violating religious freedom it 's an irrelevant consideration . 
   since someone who thinks hitler is a god does not infringe on anyone 's freedom . 
  put a swastika on a burqa and it does n't magically become evil . 
  the problem with a general ban on face covering is that it would not be proportional in achieving the one realistic basis for justification ( public safety ) . 
  this issue does n't exist in the case of nazi symbols . 
   maybe you missed the point that since the germans have no yet proposed any law regarding a face covering ban , this discussion is purely based on theory . 
  we know however that there are people who belief it is their religious duty to wear a burka , which means the theory has relevant practical implications . 
   and speaking of theory , / u/marktplatz [ +127 ] said that such a ban would be perfectly fine apparently in public closed spaces i 'm talking about a a general public ban . 
  you also continue to move goalposts and not answer my question . 
  there are n't any as far as we know so it 's a pointless argument . 
  if there were people who sincerely held such beliefs it might be an infringement but a ) most religious practices of such a `` nazi religion '' would n't be protected as acts which violate the rights of others do not fall within the scope of protection of religious freedom and b ) banning nazi symbols would be justified anyway . 
  however this is completely irrelevant to the matter at hand and you have n't answered my question . 
  to insure there is no misunderstanding : ** i posit ** that a general ban on public face covering is an infringement on religious freedom as understood by german law and likely unjustified but that 's a different matter . 
  ** i perceive you to posit ** that such a ban would n't even be an infringement because the law would n't be specific to religious clothing -- ** here is my argument : ** 1 . 
  *** scope of protection of art. 4 i *** personal : all persons material : the ability to adopt a belief as well as to openly profess your belief and live according to its rules including religious celebrations and so on . 
  the full extent of the scope of protection is thus determined by the individual beliefs of the person . 
  *** infringement *** : an infringement is any state action that completely or partially restricts behaviour , which fall within the scope of protection of a right . 
  the burka is worn by muslim women predominantly in afghanistan , parts of iraq and the arabian peninsula . 
  they consider wearing the burka a religious duty . 
  wearing the burka is a religious practice within the scope of protection of art. 4 i gg . 
  by enacting a general ban on public face coverings , women who wear the burka based on their religious beliefs are prevented from practising these beliefs . 
  there is an infringement 1 . 
  *** justification *** there is no reservation of statutory powers and thus freedom of religion can only be restricted by conflicting constitutional law . 
  ** human dignity from art. 1 gg . 
  ** human dignity is a protection against the state not against your own decisions . 
  ** ensuring public safety based on art . 
  2 abs . 
  2 s. 1 gg ** the echr finds a general ban disproportional as mandating people to remove face covering if asked is sufficient to address safety concerns and a less severe restriction of freedom of religion . 
  a general ban would only be proportional if there was a general threat to public safety . 
  the german constitutional court would probably follow a similar argument . 
  the echr accepted the french ban on the grounds that it protects `` respect for the minimum requirements of life in society '' .
