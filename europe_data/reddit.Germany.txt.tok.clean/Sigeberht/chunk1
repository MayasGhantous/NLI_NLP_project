thanks , reacting well to situations that arise makes them an opportunity - sound like a he is doing a good job . 
  is he seen as a good foreign minister ? 
  as mentioned in the article we had [ westerwelle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guido_westerwelle ) in the same position and pretty much the only positive thing that can be said about him is that he is openly gay . 
  shake the bottle - problem solved . 
  good points , anything that is not full fat is white water - though homogenized just refers to the milk fat being broken down to small particles so the it does not accumulate at the top . 
  that changes the taste by rupturing the milk lipid globules . 
  having lived in asian countries where people still get infected with tuberculosis by raw milk i am not to keen to try anything unpasteurized . 
  more accurate nautical charts and bathymetric data - repeated depth soundings are interpolated to give a more accurate picture of the sea floor . 
  this is usually shared to create a something like the [ general bathymetric chart ] ( http://www.gebco.net/ ) , though it does not hurt if you intend to hide a submarine . 
  interesting read , there were quite some similarities to east germany - the thing i miss the least is the glorious aluminium cutlery . 
  i agree the milk was better , probably because back then it was not homogenized and not treated for extended shelf life . 
  certainly , this is obviously the most important topic in the universe . 
   take that ... mecklenburg-vorpommern too bad virtually all of mv is at the same height or north of hamburg , but i am sure you have a great view of the alps down there . 
  looks like i 'll have kebab for lunch . 
  [ even the ukrainians say she was a volunteer for aidar . 
   during the 2014 pro-russian conflict in ukraine , savchenko fought as a volunteer in the east of ukraine in the aidar battalion . 
  from the wiki page above , sources are there . 
  on the contrary , volunteering for a unit that ai say has ` acquired locally a reputation for brutal reprisals , robbery , beatings and extortion ' makes her the perfect role model who is entirely above criticism . 
  no need to mention she was in the aidar battalion , which [ has it 's own take on human rights ] ( http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/eur50/040/2014/en/bb06b5cb-dcb4-4f69-bb3e-c800987676cc/eur500402014en.html ) . 
  there is a [ review of what rfe broadcast ] ( http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsaebb/nsaebb76/doc10.pdf ) to hungary among other documents at the [ national security archive ] ( http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsaebb/nsaebb76/ ) . 
  they have info some info on east germany in 1953 and czechoslovakia 1968 as well . 
  that is about as bad as gets in a direct democracy , representative ones have invaded other countries for similar reasons . 
  again , the swiss system is not perfect , but we should copy some of their ideas . 
  except for luxembourg , the swiss have the highest percentage of foreign born citizens in their country . 
  that is not exactly xenophobic . 
  and like planning , financing and building a tunnel through the alps , while the enlightened politicians in germany struggle with a train station and an airport . 
  there are more positive aspects than negative ones in this , from my perspective . 
  agreed , in direct democracy people will rise to the occasion , just as they cause less accidents when there are less traffic signs . 
  well done guys , particularly the physics prize for the first particle accelerator . 
  however , the true science capital is in the faroe islands , who have a 20 noble laureates per million with their one prize on roughly 50k inhabitants . 
  the public are trying to inform themselves but their level is being dragged down by the media . 
  [ hans rosling did some surveys on this lately ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm5xf-uygdg ) and backs it up . 
  the swiss have done much better with a direct democracy for centuries than the surrounding countries without one . 
  the context is quite different in the [ original interview ] ( http://rbth.co.uk/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html ) - gorbachev essentially says that during his reign the eastward expansion of nato was discussed in the context of germany and he made sure that would not happen [ ( art . 
  5 ( 3 ) of the 2 +4 treaty ) ] ( http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm ) . 
  the expansion into eastern europe happened after his his term of office ended in december 1991 - this is what he thinks about it :  the decision for the u.s. and its allies to expand nato into the east was decisively made in 1993 . 
  i called this a big mistake from the very beginning . 
  it was definitely a violation of the spirit of the statements and assurances made to us in 1990 . 
  with regards to germany , they were legally enshrined and are obeyed . 
  i would say he is building his legacy , and implicitly blaming yeltsin for the weird current situation , where alliance troops can not be stationed slightly east of the cold war border but right next to the russian border is fine . 
  it is a former lutheran church from 1905 the copts bought . 
  [ ( german wiki ) ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/glaubenskirche_%28berlin-lichtenberg%29 ), 
  threatening someone 's children 's education or spouse 's career can be very convincing . 
  it was not just the distrust but the state 's capability to actually force the its will on anyone , through subtle yet brutal methods . 
  of course , nothing would have happened without the end of the breshnev doctrine . 
  no matter what you fold it like , if you were of interest , the stasi would [ keep a record of your personal scent ] ( http://www.dw.de/the-stasi-had-a-giant-smell-register-of-dissidents/a-2555053 ) . 
  it must be the darkness and depressing weather in november that puts everyone in germany into a rebellious mood . 
  some exceptions are the 1848 revolution in march and the 1953 east german popular uprising in june . 
  if repeated , you would be marked as not politically dependable in your personal file , which would hamper your education and career . 
  in addition , this would make it harder for any relative as well - their personal file would say they are related to someone suspicious . 
  the more amusing way was to subvert the system from within - fly a larger flag that the local party secretary watch him run to replace his small one . 
  demands for german unification became prevalent after the became clear that the soviets would not repeat 1953 and the east german army was not on the side of the regime . 
  the clearly visible loss of control of the repression system when the wall came down in november drastically increased the frequency of these demands . 
  there is [ quantitative research on the demonstration demands in ` 89 ] ( http://www.hait.tu-dresden.de/dok/parolen.pdf ) by the hannah arendt institute at the tu dresden . 
  it would be nice if we could return the favour . 
  yes , the parades usually were there , the western part still is called karl-marx-allee . 
  you are quite a way west then . 
  no , that was yesterday - tag der republik was the 7 . 
  october . 
  it has been a while since we had a proper military parade , though . 
   ... after becoming frustrated that they were fighting rival rebel factions as opposed to forces loyal to the country 's president ... 
  in their case disillusioned does not seem to mean disillusioned with war or their ideology , but not being able to murder the people they hoped they would . 
  if that attitude is not perfect for reintegration into european society , i do not know what is . 
  do n't worry , our politicians are no better , particularly the third rate ones dumped at the eu . 
  this is a 16th century propaganda map [ glorifying charles v and house habsburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_regina ) and suggesting they should rule all of europe from spain . 
  this might be related to the [ congress of berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congress_of_berlin ) bismarck hosted ten years before in which the great powers negotiated their spheres of influence . 
  yet , the conversation we are having takes place on the products of just these . 
  modern technology has become so complex that it exceeds the capabilities of a single person to craft a complete product - our world has become more social , more cooperative and i am happy it did . 
  quite on the contrary , it is the modern mass production that gives us the standard if living we have , not the craftsmen . 
  there are no traditional craftsmen left - either they all use raw materials and tools from industrial processes and most likely from overseas as well . 
  the head designer of the mass-manufactured bending phone is european as well . 
  few things in this world are made on a single continent these days . 
  top three in accessories : ipad cover , leather ipad sleeve , leather iphone sleeve . 
  that is certainly the pinnacle of european engineering and design . 
  the polio virus exists in the wild anyway , infections usually occur through unclean water . 
  that is rather improbable in any area with good sanitation and hygiene . 
  there is also a new [ browser plugin that highlights the side jobs and other connections ] ( https://cahoots-extension.github.io/ ) german journalists have to lobby groups . 
  this is pretty rich coming from a country that spends even less per gdp on the military than germany does while getting subsidised by the eu . 
  [ not many ] ( http://blog.edreams.com/in-flight-wifi/ ) , but it seems to be picking up speed a bit . 
  i 'll choose a flight with wi-fi over one without any time as well . 
  try them with beer instead of wine . 
  the story is [ also covered by a local newspaper ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.landbote.ch%2fdetail%2farticle%2fhohe-sozialkosten-wir-muessen-annehmen-dass-die-steuern-steigen%2fgnews%2f99283868%2f&amp;edit-text= ) of the canton this village is in . 
  the tax increase looks rather certain to them as well . 
  nokia made lots of friends : they bought out the wireless communications group from siemens and promptly sold the iranian government equipment to snoop on phone calls . 
  in germany nokia grabbed subsidies for a phone plant and then closed the subsidised plant in bochum firing thousands - it would be cheaper to produce in romania . 
  however , they pulled off the same stunt in cluj , grabbing the subsidies and closing the plant shortly after , firing thousands again . 
  i do n't think anyone outside finland gives a shit . 
  the individual and perceived inflation is different than the official average , because the individual consumption patterns diverge . 
  for instance , food , electricity and public transport have increased above average ; rent stayed the same , electronics and communication services became much cheaper . 
  depending on what one spends or has to spend most of one 's income on , things can look quite different . 
  the [ german statistics office has the data for that ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/prices/consumerpriceindices/tables/top20.html ) and and [ a tool to estimate the individual inflation rate ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/service/interactive/inflationcalculatorsvg.svg?view=svg ) . 
  the [ icrc has been in contact with both the ukrainian and russian government ] ( http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2014/08-11-ukraine-east-civilians-plight-concern.htm ) and [ is requesting the clarification of details today ] ( http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/interview/2014/08-13-ukraine-donbass-russian-convoy-corbaz.htm ) . 
  that is slightly different than ` no affiliation ' . 
  no amount of reason could sway the faith of the greens , at least not the german ones . 
  that is because borders typically follow rivers and any power plant needs water for cooling . 
  the amount paid as a penalty in to end a trial this way is not based on the total wealth , but on the value of the trial . 
  it is roughly 1 to 3 times the amount owed . 
  for instance , if someone evades taxes for 1000 $ , the penalty would be in the range of 1000 to 3000 $ . 
  ecclestone bribed 33 million $ , the result is well within the range of 33 to 99 million one would expect . 
  ideally , i would hope my body to be used in an anatomical autopsy to teach future students .
