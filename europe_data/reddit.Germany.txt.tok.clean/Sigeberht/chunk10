  for culinary enlightenment , is there any record of what type of pizza was ordered ? 
  ` ungl\u00fcck ' is similar in meanings in german runs into comparable issues in translation . 
  ` misfortune ' might be a more adequate translation into english , even though the word is slightly antiquated . 
  in 2018 actually , the law will not come into effect earlier . 
  it took her a week to decide whether to stand up for liberty or a foreign ruler . 
  certainly , there is not much about this whole affair that is not ridiculous , including the actions of the government at the moment . 
  the [ law requires ] ( https://dejure.org/gesetze/stgb/104a.html ) that [ diplomatic relations ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:diplomatic_missions_of_germany.png ) and reciprocity exist at the time , that there is a request for prosecution and political interest from the german government to prosecute . 
  the same legal situation exists for the dear leader as for the gl\u00f6rious s\u00fcltan - so do n't say anything bad about best korea 's head of government should merkel ever decide so slime up to its leader . 
  on the bright side , the team working on it said fuzes were well made brass ones that were relatively easy to remove . 
  being made a vassal king by napoleon for fighting the emperor a few months before the end of the hre does not count as historic kingdom - it may count as a french kingdom though . 
  any official recognition of nobility was abolished when the republic was declared in 1918 . 
  most of the former german nobles work or run businesses as well . 
  historically the only king in the hre was the bohemian one , anyone else ruling a state was a prince , duke or count of some degree and we had [ plenty of those ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/hrr_1789.png ) . 
  awesome , he has probably done more honest work in his life than most politicians in germany . 
  bad example , this picture is from weimar and buchenwald , the americans were there from april to july 1945 , after which the area was handed over to the soviets . 
  they then promptly reopened buchenwald as nkvd special camp no . 
  2 , and ran it until 1950 . 
  there was not much liberation involved with that . 
  you do n't even need to bring up a question about hypothetical biological weapons . 
  the answer is quite simple in the real case of the existing bombs : the local state and the local community does the cleanup . 
  every german federal state finances its own bomb disposal service specialized on war munitions . 
  significant amounts of munitions like [ this 4000lb air mine ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:fundort_luftmine_04_koblenz_2011.jpg ) are still buried beneath many city centers . 
  at least they got to buy copies of the reconnaissance photos taken after bombing runs from the allies to start systematic searches . 
  dawn is a pakistani paper , so they are probably referring to [ the laws there ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law_in_pakistan#religious_offences_and_punishments ) , and they have plenty . 
  one example would be the austrians calling an apricot ` marille ' instead of ` aprikose ' . 
  this is closer to ` marelica ' or ` meru\u0148ka ' in slavic languages than ` abricot ' or ` albicocco ' in romanic languages where the north germans borrowed that word . 
  that is actually mentioned in the same article op posted - for 2007 the us embassy estimated $ 5 billion from the bases and $ 872 million benefit from the salaries of german employees . 
  this is probably less now since the troop deployments were reduced , but should still be in the same area . 
  this does not seem to take into account the european driver 's permits . 
  for instance , [ germany accepts any eu and eea driver 's license as long as it is valid in the issuing country ] ( https://www.bmvi.de/shareddocs/de/artikel/la/gueltigkeit-auslaendischer-fahrerlaubnisse-fuehrerscheine-in-der-bundesrepublik-deutschland.html?nn=58398#doc21710bodytext2 ) , yet the site claims ` in germany , a french licence has power ranking 4 valid only with international drivers permit ( idp ) ' . 
  that should be the [ same for all eu countries ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/driving-licence/driving-licence-recognition-validity/index_en.htm ) . 
  i occasionally listened to it when abroad , but germans living at home probably prefer the local channels . 
  deutsche welle is the german international broadcaster - the equivalent would be the bbc foreign service or the voice of america . 
  edit : it should be bbc world service . 
  nice tiki torches , they certainly add a traditional hawaiian touch to the whole thing . 
  beer is considered a basic food , particularly in areas like bavaria at the time - drinking a liter a day would be normal . 
  it is just in contrast to the propaganda image of an ascetic . 
  the warden 's files on hitler 's 1923/24 incarceration were rediscovered and analysed - as a [ privileged prisoner he was permitted to buy his own food while in prison ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/article/71c627d98d1b4f3eb58602acc614a797/records-show-hitler-enjoyed-special-treatment-prison ) . 
  this included 55 to 60 half liter bottles of beer a month - a liter per day hardly qualifies as abstinence . 
  though the propaganda claimed that [ hitler would not drink or smoke ] ( https://www.dhm.de/lemo/bestand/objekt/99001540 ) , that is the usual bullshit . 
   ahah watch the german defending germany 's right to bribe and corrupt it 's way . 
  this type moral grandstanding is particularly funny coming from france where [ alstom has recently been caught ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/us-judge-fines-alstom-722m-decade-long-bribery-scheme-2184529 ) just like siemens and [ thales in bribing its way through malaysia , who are a company partially owned by the government ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fab19252-ca85-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html ) , to name just a few . 
  it is not like this was specifically german problem . 
  the irony here is that he is part of a party that regularly advocates for more internet surveillance and data retention . 
  after all , citizens who do no wrong have nothing to hide - particularly if they just want to keep up to date on current bdsm trends they heard about at a ski lift . 
  they got one thing right - the 12 $ entry fee they charged is the same as the 25dm the east german government charged . 
  the best socialism money can buy . 
  much easier , they killed democracy before it became a problem , for instance : [ eradicating the freely elected soviets in kronstadt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kronstadt_rebellion ) , and stomping into the ground the democracy movements in '53 east germany , '56 hungary , '68 czechoslovakia and '80 poland . 
  police said the grenade is an [ m52 from former yugoslavia and that was thrown next to the occupied container office of the security service on site . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.badische-zeitung.de%2fvillingen-schwenningen%2fwar-die-handgranate-scharf-schwere-der-straftat-haengt-von-zuender-ab--116852693.html&amp;edit-text= ) they are currently trying to determine if the grenade contained a detonator , i.e. 
  if it was intended to explode . 
  for everyone asking about the police record : as far as reported , he was [ jailed for two weeks in 2014 for a narcotics conviction ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/politik/attentaeter-hatte-mehrere-identitaeten-article16734531.html ) , and [ 30 hours of social work in late 2014 for theft and fare evasion ] ( http://www.ksta.de/koeln/sote-angreifer-von-paris-spur-fuehrt-nach-koeln,15187530,33492220.html ) . 
  there also were three separate jail terms in 2015 for assault and narcotics offences . 
  the charges of illegal weapon possession are from november 2015 and had apparently not yet been tried in court . 
  a great example of successful rehabilitation and reintegration into society , even if was the one of a neighbouring country this time . 
  neither , they 'll pack up and leave for greener pastures like the previous inhabitants . 
  these buildings are empty because there is no longer the heavy industry employing thousands like when they were built . 
  [ that flag looks familiar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernst_th%c3%a4lmann_pioneer_organisation ) - and [ on closer inspection , the scene is from dresden in 1951 . 
  ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:bundesarchiv_bild_183-09709-0002,_dresden,_ankunft_eines_indischen_gaststudenten.jpg ) is is safe to assume that this is a propaganda picture and that most people have been required to show up to for the required demonstration of proletarian internationalism . 
  nevertheless , providing university education to students from other countries is always a good idea and something we should do more of anyway . 
  goes well with the cocktail , so accept no substitutes . 
  those people were mostly delivering bread baskets their starving neighbors , i assume . 
  depends , the tradition of the christkind is more prevalent in southern germany today and santa claus / weihnachtsmann were adapted in the north much later than the song was written . 
  stille nacht is from austria near salzburg , though a bit of anschluss is always fun . 
  plenty of good ones from germany , these are some of the best know ones [ alle jahre wieder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2dd65ck6qy ) [ es ist ein ros entsprungen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1hnpy1ecmk ) [ o du fr\u00f6hliche ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rplotmeov8 ) and of course [ o tannenbaum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/o_tannenbaum ) , which has been adapted and covered by almost everyone . 
  we probably all got this aphorism from the [ romans themselves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milliarium_aureum ) . 
  and that is entirely fine from my perspective , particularly since running high definition cameras in a vacuum near a superheated plasma is not trivial . 
  there are [ larger images of the plasma ] ( http://www.ipp.mpg.de/3984226/12_15 ) on the institute 's web site . 
  so that is where q retired . 
  [ bet , kinder bet ... ] ( https://youtu.be/wdfdvvul-wg?t=6 ), 
  of course not , i have been a humorless german for even longer . 
  oh yes , those horrible swedes - the complete opposite of [ tilly with his catholic paragons of virtue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_of_magdeburg ) and an emperor who would rather rule over a desert than a country full of heretics . 
  the [ results are available online already ] ( http://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/einsatz_deutscher_streitkraefte_gegen_den_is_in_syrien-1105-777---abstimmungsverhalten-abst_ent.html#abst_verhalten ) - \u00d6zdemir abstained , the others voted as described , as well . 
  what an enormous improvement - i am sure most classical building would look much more intriguing with a giant clothes iron stuck on top . 
  hamburg has good reasons to look at costs - the new philharmonic building was supposed to cost from 77 to 114 million and ended up with a 789 million price tag . 
  considering the same politicians were planning the olympic games , i would be skeptical too . 
  berlin is roughly the same distance from kaliningrad as katowice and krakow are , and within the same iskander range as much of poland . 
   we demand an equal level of security ... 
  the level of security is the same as in berlin and eastern germany for which the [ 2 +4 treaty limits the stationed troops to german ones without nuclear capability . 
  clearly , in no way could one be better informed about what russia is up to than by reading a ukrainian site doxing the wife and father of a pilot . 
  well done poland . 
  [ pew put more comprehensive results online ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/18/global-support-for-principle-of-free-expression-but-opposition-to-some-forms-of-speech/ ) , if anyone is interested in more details . 
  our local bakers have been running [ apprentice exchange programs for decades ] ( http://www.ofaj.org/des-apprentis-boulangers-et-p-tissiers-de-paris-et-de-berlin-d-veloppent-des-produits-originaux-fran ) , they might be more international than expected . 
  looks incomplete - [ this map shows a thousand breweries in germany ] ( http://www.kalimedia.com/bierkarte_deutschland.html ) , for instance . 
   ... mafed , backed by us civil rights campaigner angela davis ... ah yes , the [ one of the eastern block 's pet communists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angela_davis ) - kissing up to communist party heads is not as popular today it seems . 
  this was the [ official propaganda shot ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/bundesarchiv_bild_183-85458-0001,_berlin,_mauerbau,_am_brandenburger_tor.jpg ) of the wall , which was [ repeated ad nauseam ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/bundesarchiv_bild_183-1987-0704-057%2c_berlin%2c_750-jahr-feier%2c_festumzug%2c_mauerbau.jpg ) even [ 25 years later ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/bundesarchiv_bild_183-1986-0813-460%2c_berlin%2c_parade_von_kampfgruppen_zum_mauerbau.jpg ) . 
  he lied to the deans investigating the case about his account being hacked and him not posting what he did . 
  the university then found evidence of the contrary in their investigation . 
  these lies are what caused ` the relationship of trust [ to be ] irretrievably shattered . ', 
  the quote expresses a specific legal concept in german that justifies immediate dismissal . 
   ~ heinrich heine , 1933 that was probably zombie heine , considering he was dead for more than 70 years in 1933 . 
  well , at least it was not his usual baloon animal .

  there is the occasional grumpy immigration officer , but that really is about it . 
  i never had the impression that normal americans did anything that would warrant animosity - if i were to generalize , people in the states are more friendly than in many parts of europe . 
  i have been to many backwater places in central florida and recently went to northern california , it is always amazing to see that the great in the great outdoors is no exaggeration . 
  in europe , people would expect a declaration of nationality and citizenship when they say ' i am irish ' or ' i am german ' , not ancestry , as would be the case in america .
