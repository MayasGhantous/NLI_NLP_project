  i would guess that this is mostly a misunderstanding . 
  depends on your preferences , i would suggest a region near several borders . 
  interesting cities are often in close proximity , vienna-batislava-budapest is roughly 3 hours to drive , prague-dresden-wroclaw a bit more than 4 hours . 
  the same is true about the cologne , brussels , amsterdam and so on . 
  these maps reach surprisingly far east . 
  i would not have expected a roman map to extend into india as far as it does . 
  even if you do not think of the ship , the [ titans of mythology did not end too well either ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titanomachy ) . 
  in the first example , the misunderstanding seems to be where the appropriate amount formality is required . 
  politely declining food one is offered is courteous in german as well . 
  however , this type of ' i do not want to impose ' - no is more suited to a formal dinner invitation than the day to day interactions in a household . 
  in general , clear and unambiguous communication is considered a form of courtesy in german , but one has to keep in mind the context in in which it is applied - it may still appear as subtle as a sledgehammer to other cultures . 
  `` i am fond of pigs . 
  dogs look up to us . 
  cats look down on us . 
  pigs treat us as equals . '', 
  - winston churchill the pig is also a symbol of wealth and good fortune in the context of a piggy bank . 
  they probably did not intend those associations , though . 
  this article is a bit of a shitty translation , to be honest . 
  according to the slighly more complete german versions it looks like this [ ( zeit ) ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-04/eu-auslaender-andrea-nahles-hartz-iv-sozialhilfe ) [ ( welt ) ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/article158606019/regierung-will-sozialhilfe-fuer-eu-auslaender-drastisch-einschraenken.html ) : this change in the law targets eu-citizens who come to germany unemployed and stay unemployed for the duration of their stay . 
  only in this specific case does it take 5 years until benefits are paid . 
  any eu-citizen having a job in germany is treated the same way as before and like a german citizen , even if they become unemployed later . 
  indeed they are quite old , during the crusades arab contemporaries thought that letting one 's wife shake hands with and talk to others in public was strange :  the franks are without any vestige of a sense of honour and jealousy . 
  if one of them goes along the street with his wife and meets a friend , this man will take the woman 's hand and lead her aside to talk , while the husband stands by waiting until she has finished her conversation . 
  if she takes too long about it he leaves her with the other man and goes on his way . 
  [ ( source ) ] ( https://books.google.com/books?id=jkvoyvqkjnwc&amp;pg=pa77&amp;lpg=pa77&amp;dq=the+franks+are+without+any+vestige&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b_zyeywye-&amp;sig=i8iegoibe_qsj_ob_56bv46oruq&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20franks%20are%20without%20any%20vestige&amp;f=false ), 
  most communist countries had a state run store that was supposed to siphon any hard , western currency off the population by providing western consumer goods or even just rare local ones . 
  in addition to this , the secret services could observe who shopped there , thereby determining who had access to western currency , contacts or relatives in the west . 
  [ pewex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pewex ) in poland , [ intershop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intershop ) in east germany , the pages link to other examples . 
  the romantic interpretation is : ` form the blackness of servitude through bloody battles into the golden light of freedom . ', 
  it might also just be the colors of the holy roman empire 's flag in a tricolor flag . 
  much better , i am not sure baja california and sonora would do well with polar bears anyway - europe has enough cold places already . 
  yes , spanish would certainly become much more important , but english is not going to be replaced - it is just too useful as an international trade language . 
  spanish already is an official eu language - it kind of comes with having the very country called spain as a member state . 
  the bbc article might have preceded the announcement of the autopsy results - i am sure some of the german articles were updated later in the day . 
  the specific claim was that he had for a long time been afflicted by a chronic , incurable disease leading to organ failure . 
  there are not that many organs to spare in a human body . 
  the coroner found no evidence of that claim . 
   he also apparently had an incurable illness . 
  he apparently did not . 
  the prosecutor 's office stated that the autopsy found [ no evidence of a life-threatening illness ] ( https://www.rbb-online.de/politik/beitrag/2016/09/pirat-gerwald-claus-brunner-tot1.html ) . 
  sorry to hear that , we had a rather substantial [ measles epidemic in berlin during the winter 2014/15 . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-measles-epidemic-reaches-new-high/a-18301149 ) unfortunately , it was not enough to introduce mandatory inoculations , even though there has been and probably still is a large majority for it . 
  there is no 5 percent cutoff in these local elections and the fdp increased their number of seats in a number of councils . 
  we did not need the swedes for that , but they helped return the favor to the catholics in southern germany after [ magdeburg was sacked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sack_of_magdeburg ) . 
  a state election and a number of county and municipal elections are hard to compare . 
  this is what it looks like if the [ county elections for the state are summed up  ( https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/kommunalwahl_niedersachsen_2016/kommunalwahlen-in-niedersachsen-das-sind-die-ergebnisse,kommunalwahl632.html ) party | change | result -- | -- | -- cdu | -2.6 % | 34.4 % spd | -3.7 % | 31.2 % greens | -3.4 % | 10.9 % afd | +7.8 % | 7.8 % fdp | +1.4 % | 4.8 % as usual in politics , everyone is a winner . 
  san marino uses an italian postal code though , so it might be slightly helpful if processed there . 
   sounds very swedish . 
  in more than one sense even : he is standing for election in the electoral district of nordwestmecklenburg ii , including the [ island of poel and neukloster , which were swedish for a while . 
  day care was discussed in point 9 of the agenda . 
  she showed at the end of the day care discussion up dressed like this for point 10 of the agenda , the discussion of the [ draft of a law proposed by the afd to outlaw face covering ] ( http://www.parldok.thueringen.de/parldok/dokument/59252/th%c3%bcringer-gesetz-zum-schutz-des-%c3%b6ffentlichen-raums-als-sph%c3%a4re-der-freiheit-vorabdruck-.pdf ) this information can be found right in the first source you mention , and also in the [ local paper ] ( http://www.thueringer-allgemeine.de/web/zgt/politik/detail/-/specific/eklat-im-landtag-afd-abgeordnete-erscheint-vollverschleiert-700924567 ) . 
  i meant that licence plates that look similar to civilian ones are used at all , in contrast to the [ painted on version ] ( http://www.bundesheer.at/archiv/a2005/dispute05/galerie/vollbild/05_dispute_1.jpg ) like on this austrian tank . 
  a tank in syria obviously would not have a romanian military license plate . 
  [ tanks having regular looking license plates not unusual . 
  mistakes were made , of course . 
  in the [ german interview ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/kanzlerin-merkel-im-sz-interview-deutschland-wird-deutschland-bleiben-1.3141520 ) , she says ` we germans have ignored this problem for too long . 
  in 2004 and 2005 already , a lot of refugees arrived and we left it to spain and others at the external borders to deal with this issue . ', 
  in this case , we is her predecessor , schr\u00f6der , who was chancellor until late november 2005 . 
  merkel then goes on to mention that ` germany was quite happy to let others deal with the topic after taking in so many refugees during the yugoslav wars . ', 
  most of the folks from these areas had returned by 1998 , when conveniently , schr\u00f6ders first term started . 
  this is not exactly an admission she or her government made mistakes . 
  probably from a suspended scaffold like in the last picture - the amount of paint needed for these large areas weighs quite a lot as well . 
  even so , that is not entirely incorrect . 
  the scandal or its resolution really has not been going anywhere since 2009 . 
  nope , the polish prime minister wore this because she visited the pope , the head of her religion . 
  when [ merkel visits the pope , she does not wear a headscarf ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-chancellor-merkel-meets-with-pope-francis/a-18272354 ) - she is protestant , not catholic . 
  the ddr constitution mentioned a right and a duty to work , whether one wanted to or not . 
  generally , the wages back then were so low that both parents in a typical household had to work anyway . 
  because everyone of working age was expected to have job , the government had to ensure the infrastructure was available to support this . 
  the wide availability of kindergartens was introduced then and all the subsequent governments have tried to keep the level that high by popular demand . 
  in the eastern german states there is also a much higher availability of kindergarten places available . 
  the average is that [ 86 percent of 2 to 3 year olds are enrolled compared to 55 percent ] ( http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/1650.html ) the western states . 
  as a quick update : the guy was accused anonymously on wednesday , [ the state attorney threw the case out right on the next day , ] ( http://www.rosenheim24.de/bayern/muenchen-anwohner-wegen-beleidigung-amoklaeufers-angezeigt-6632788.html ) speculating that this guy telling the shooter what an arsehole he really is might have contributed to the perpetrator not using the other 300 bullets he had left . 
  the french did not [ leave them a choice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_invasion_of_switzerland ) . 
  the license plate is a german export/customs licence plate , the red bar on the side shows the date when it becomes invalid . 
  sta is for landkreis ( county ) starnberg in bavaria . 
  oh , he knew already : erdogan is a recipient of the [ gaddafi human rights prize ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-gaddafi_international_prize_for_human_rights ) . 
  i already sent them an email asking for the size and requested they put it on the product page for everyone . 
  having considered to order [ a map ] ( https://bookshop.europa.eu/en/the-european-union-pbik0114784/?catalogcategoryid=5giep2ixseyaaaeu.lwd0udl ) form the store , i would like to know its size before ordering in vain . 
  instead of anything useful they list cryptic stuff like ` pages : 8 _ ' and the weight of the map . 
  while this information might be great for their internal shipping system , we have european standard formats to describe paper sizes and measurements . 
  if even the people in charge of representing the eu to its citizens can not provide useful information to us , it is no wonder the eu comes across as a bunch of self absorbed bureaucrats . 
  in general we should get rather far if everyone in europe knew one language from each major language family , like romance , germanic and slavic . 
  since most speak one of those already that should be feasible in normal schooling . 
   ** little ** girls are gender neutral since that usually comes up in any discussion of german : m\u00e4dchen is a diminutive , all diminutives are neutral . 
  it is quite a simple rule if one knows it . 
  i hope he tells the referee that he farts in his general direction . 
  they are treated just like any married couple of adults - but that is not relevant , because the changes being discussed are not about couples of adults . 
  german law prohibits polygamy and underage marriage - these laws should apply to everyone living there , no matter where they came from . 
  guess [ who else ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_german ) does that . 
  the actual data is published on the [ german db page ] ( https://www.bahn.de/p/view/buchung/auskunft/puenktlichkeit_personenverkehr.shtml ) . 
  the first tab is the total , the second the long range trains , the third the short range ones including metros , light rail and everything else . 
  the thing people are referring to are the long distance journeys and in that category 78.5 percent of trains arrive within 5 minutes of schedule and 92.5 percent within 15 minutes . 
  it should be fairly obvious that for a german this is the very definition of anarchy and chaos . 
  not even the pakistani flag , it is the wrong way a round and missing the white stripe at the hoist side . 
  east germany received a billion d-mark loan from the west in the 80ies , they would not want to endanger that or any of the other trade deals they had going . 
  this had the effect of no one being shot while foreign dignitaries were visiting , for instance . 
  not that it did no longer happen , [ at night or when the state visit was over ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chris_gueffroy ) . 
  ok , that makes sense - the east germany party valued its foreign currency supply more than anything else , so they would ease up ever so slightly under scrutiny . 
  what saved them was the guy with the camera and the crowd of people .
