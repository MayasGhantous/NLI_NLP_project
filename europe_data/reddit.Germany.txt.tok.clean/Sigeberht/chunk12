  they tried to avoid bad pr , and would have shot them at night or when no western witnesses would have been present . 
  yeah right . 
  among the current representatives in the thuringian landtag there are [ ina leukefeld ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ina_leukefeld ) , former volunteer snitch for the east german political criminal police and [ frank kuschel ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank_kuschel ) , a former deputy mayor , then tasked with the repression of families requesting to leave east germany officially . 
  great reformists , all of them . 
  who gave that idiot the master plan for the new reich ? 
  oh , it is this article again - [ most people in europe live significantly north of the us , even parts of canada ] ( http://brilliantmaps.com/population-latitude/ ) . 
  while the local climate might be different in the respective areas , the intensity and duration of sun depends on the latitude . 
  the question should be : is [ calgary using more air-conditioning than london and is miami using more than bahrain ] ( http://brilliantmaps.com/cities-transposed-latitude/ ) ? 
   royal mail , by contrast , classifies a5 envelopes as standard letters . 
  that has been the case since 1959 , the [ a-series is an iso norm based on a german one . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paper_size ) the hilarity of the eu is that even letters of the same standard format can not be sent to other eu countries without problem such as this . 
  if they found an old [ bmw 321 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bmw_321 ) that might actually be true , but would be slightly less comfortable than the contemporary version . 
  good question - [ apparently they are restructuring kaufland and cutting costs there in favor of expanding lidl . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.handelsblatt.com%2funternehmen%2fhandel-konsumgueter%2fschwarz-gruppe-lidl-vor-expansion-kaufland-muss-sparen%2f11937168.html&amp;edit-text= ) this might be some sort of explanation , if that is what they are doing at the moment . 
  that is interesting , i thought they were just overpriced from the first description . 
  i hope the competition shows them the way out then . 
  [ kaufland and lidl are brands of the schwarz holding ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwarz_gruppe ) , they will avoid direct price competition . 
  in germany , kaufland stores will be a bit more upscale and less of a discounter like lidl . 
  look at the data to verify the claims in articles such as this . 
  for instance , the rant about cars being a luxury - there are [ world bank statistics about the passenger cars owned per person ] ( http://chartsbin.com/view/1113 ) , and europe is not doing too badly in those . 
  one of the reasons [ walmart is no longer on the german market ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/business/worldbusiness/02walmart.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) is that german discounters such as aldi regularly beat them on grocery prices - very socialist , is n't it ? 
  this morning it was 7,20 $ per kg for local , high quality strawberries . 
  there are pound coins with those flowers on them , so you use them every day at least . 
  like many northern fruits , blackberries are so sour that one has to [ add a large amount of sugar ] ( http://www.wineturtle.com/homemade-blackberry-wine-recipe-in-4-easy-steps/ ) to get the yeast to work at all . 
  this statistic seems to be [ dividing the total sales of wine by the number of a countries ' inhabitants ] ( http://www.wineinstitute.org/files/world_per_capita_wine_consumption_revised_nov_2015.pdf ) - there is no telling what is actually drunk , used for cooking , processing and so on . 
  the current price seems to be [ around 5 $ per kilogram ] ( http://www.discounter-preisvergleich.de/suche.php?s=nutella&amp;d=global ) at german discounters . 
  most certainly , comrade . 
  for east germany that was called [ ' a fascist provocation by foreign agents ' . 
  ] ( http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/geschichte-3995.html ) ( link in german ) the one true newspaper knew that ` in west germany there are and were american agents , who draft plans for war and civil war on orders from washington ' . 
  in this case , it is not so much fear of technology rather than the very german need for order and laws . 
  obviously , if someone can not be dragged in front of a court with the lowest effort possible or laws are not covering every aspect of life , the result is anarchy and chaos . 
  one can see the rioting in the unregulated internets in the rest of the planet . 
  that did not stop people discussing it and coming up with catchy names for the scenario . 
  i am aware of the legal opinions the ecb and others published regarding leaving the emu , perhaps that should be changed , considering how well this is working out , particularly for greece . 
  that was actually what grexit meant - greece leaving the eurozone , not the eu entirely . 
  it has nothing to do with the uk considering leaving the eu , rather with lazy journalists fishing for catchwords in headlines . 
  was that name based on arkady gaidar ? 
   what if she runs out of a burning building without consulting her husband first ? 
  unfortunately , that is not an entirely theoretical question . 
  the [ religious police enforced similar rules during a school fire in mecca . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_mecca_girls%27_school_fire ), 
  you are right , i found what my misunderstanding was : the description of the subordinate clause with its osv order is decribed in the main clause in svo and the other way around for the main clause . 
  all diminutives like ' - lein ' , ' - chen ' or regional variants are neutral , which answers the famous ` why is fr\u00e4ulein not female ? ', 
  question . 
  generally yes , but i think you got subordinate and main clauses the mixed up . 
  then use ` folks ' , ` all ' , ` everyone ' or another equivalent instead of ` guys ' . 
  the tone and intent in which one addresses others with is more important than a specific word anyway . 
  take a deposit at the start of the rental contract and repair or clean the property from that if damaged - which is pretty common for rental contracts . 
  this is not about a prison , but rather the temporary holding cells in one county 's police stations are affected . 
  the caterer that used to bring in meals to those police stations cancelled the supply contract and the current method is an emergency solution until they find a new supplier . 
  that would probably improve iceland 's relations with italy more than any other law could . 
  that is down to local taste and history . 
  there is a [ competitor from former east germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nudossi ) , that uses a much higher share of hazelnuts . 
  the logic behind that recipe is that in hazelnut were grown locally , while cocoa had to be imported for hard currency . 
  that is in the same range in germany , where [ a day of care is billed at 145 $ ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.merkur.de%2fpolitik%2fterroranschlag-wuerzburg-so-viel-zahlten-steuerzahler-fuer-betreuung-von-attentaeter-meta-6595418.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  keep in mind this does not include medical costs yet . 
  [ misses the source ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/migration-patterns-and-population-gains-and-losses-in-europe/ ) and with it the legend :  to explain the colouring scheme : yellow arrows indicate migration within europe , blue arrows indicate europeans migrating to a destination outside europe , and orange arrows indicate non-europeans ( people born outside europe ) migrating to europe . 
  arrows from and to turkey were assigned both colours to represent the fact that a part of turkey is located in europe . 
  culinary traditions taken seriously , obviously . 
  this reminds me of the [ fischbr\u00f6tchenkrieg in stralsund ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.n-tv.de%2fpanorama%2fder-krieg-ums-fischbroetchen-article10692656.html&amp;edit-text= ) where a bunch of competing [ fish bun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fischbr%c3%b6tchen ) sellers attacked each other , beat up the deputy mayor and all ended up in jail for that . 
  housing , food , and other expenses for refugees are the responsibility of the german federal states as well as their counties and municipalities . 
  the 9.3 billion mentioned is a transfer to alleviate those expenses . 
  the site is not as important , it is fleeting . 
  the [ ancient german tradition of sand castles ] ( https://ssl.zeit.de/images.zeit.de/sport/2013-07/strandburg-westerland/strandburg-westerland-540x304.jpg ) is an intangible cultural heritage , of course . 
  by the way , the sign says : here , young ladies find a loving reception . 
  the churches can run those services and be compensated for all i care . 
  they should not be allowed to treat their non-clergy employees worse than secular employers though . 
  this is still the tax payer 's money being spent on a public service . 
  the churches compete for these funds with secular organisations and companies , but get privileges to ignore collective bargaining and worker 's rights . 
  as a result , the church run services pay about 25 % less for the same work secular or commercial ones do . 
  this should never happen in a secular state . 
  edited a typo . 
  it became rather obvious during the recent refugee crisis , when many politicians , including gauck and merkel justified the open border policy with christian values . 
  they certainly could not base that on democratic values , because there was no debate in parliament about this and they have not bothered to pass a proper immigration law in decades . 
  in day to day life the privileges the state gives to the churches are even more ridiculous . 
  the major churches are subsidised with around 15 billion euros from taxes each year , the state organizes the tithe collection through the income tax system ( around 10 billion ) and 50 billion are given to run hospitals and similar social services . 
  should someone be unlucky enough to work for a church run organisation , they have less rights than a normal employee and are basically at the mercy of the clergy . 
  a doctor at state funded and catholic run hospital gets divorced and remarries ? 
  fired , and the supreme labour court agrees . 
  the public display of religiosity might be less prominent in germany , but the consequences in daily life are very noticeable . 
  just look across the border : germany has state funded churches , religious classes in public schools and two governing parties that call themselves christian . 
  the chancellor is the [ daughter of a pastor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angela_merkel#early_life ) , the president [ was a pastor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joachim_gauck ) , one opposition party leader [ was the head of the entire church ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katrin_g%c3%b6ring-eckardt#religious_activities ) . 
  this inauguration was quite secular by comparison . 
  no free lunch ? 
  the moon really is a harsh mistress . 
  there are quite a lot of brewers in alsace and i would expect they had their beer delivered the same way . 
  well , it is a traditional profession that was done [ this way not too long ago ] ( http://blog.klausenerplatz-kiez.de/images/engelhardtbierkutscher1971_seitz.jpg ) and is [ celebrated in the current times . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/bierkutsche_eichbaum_fcm.jpg ), 
   the case was brought by two swiss nationals , of turkish origin , who refused to send their teenage daughters to the compulsory mixed lessons in the city of basel . 
  this might have something to do with it . 
  we are digging holes on their beaches . 
  this is purely for fun , of course , and has nothing to do with foxholes for coastal defense . 
  as usual for german media dw can not be bothered to link to the actual source . 
  the [ kas website provides several downloads ] ( http://www.kas.de/wf/de/33.47457/ ) . 
  that being said , keep in mind that the konrad-adenauer-stiftung is the party foundation of the governing cdu and that merkel 's chief of staff presented it . 
  this hardly contains anything critical of her immigration policy . 
  the study indicates that its data was gathered in jan.-apr . 
  2015 , before the refugee/immigration wave of that year . 
  in addition to this , they relied on randomised phone calls to residences , so anyone not listed in a phone book was not considered . 
  given the method , it should come as no surprise that the majority of immigrants who responded are well integrated .
