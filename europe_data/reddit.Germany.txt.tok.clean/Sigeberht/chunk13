  the majority of them lived in germany for 15 years or longer , the largest groups identified are of polish , russian and turkish origin . 
  since the article and some comments mention muslims - the total number of them interviewed is 362 . 
  that is a bit to small for a decent sample size , muslims were not a focus of the study and there is not enough data in this study to draw a lot of conclusions from . 
  edited for grammar . 
  the safety of life at sea convention states that every state has the obligation to provide search and rescue to [ persons in distress at sea around its coasts ] ( https://mcanet.mcga.gov.uk/public/c4/solasv/index.html ) , with tunisia being the closest functioning state . 
  the [ search and rescue convention ] ( https://cil.nus.edu.sg/rp/il/pdf/1979%20international%20convention%20on%20maritime%20search%20and%20rescue-pdf.pdf ) mandates cooperation with neighboring states ( 3.1.1 ) and the rescue of anyone regardless of legal state ( 2.1.10 ) . 
  in international law , there is an obligation to participate in the rescue for any neighboring state , which in this case happens to be tunisia . 
  of course , if someone wants to run a ferry service to italy , there is little the tunisian sar can do . 
  if the ngos wanted to minimize the number of people drowning at sea , they would drop them off at the closest harbor , back in lybia or tunisia . 
  this would allow them to spend more time in the rescue area , giving them a better chance to rescue more people . 
  on busses this is usually a valve that cuts the connection to the pneumatic system that the bus uses anyway . 
  it also depressurizes the pneumatic cylinder keeping the door shut , so the door can be opened manually . 
  depends on the subreddit - the top post on r/engineeringporn / is [ currently casting a propeller ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/engineeringporn/comments/5gb2vu/casting_a_gigantic_propeller_at_1800f/ ) , which is essentially a 5000 year old technology . 
  good engineering ages well . 
  those who have read the european union commission implementation regulation no 1333/2011 , presumably . 
  in the hre , german law was based on germanic customary law codified and unified in the sachsenspiegel , not unlike what had happened previously for the common law in england . 
  in german regions , it was applied from around 1220 to 1900 . 
  there are some nice scans of the surviving [ illuminated manuscripts of the sachsenspiegel ] ( http://www.slub-dresden.de/en/collections/manuscripts/sachsenspiegel/ ) at several libraries . 
  austria introduced secularisation laws even before prussia did - they just had an easier time having a catholic emperor . 
  specifically , the kulturkampf was against the ultramontanist faction in the catholic church . 
  as the culmination of [ silly ideas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syllabus_of_errors ) , they declared the pope to be infallible in 1870 , pissing off secularists and states everywhere . 
  france , switzerland and italy had similar problems at the time . 
  the kulturkampf was for the secularisation of the state , equal laws , schools and civil registries ( birth , marriage and death ) for all citizens . 
  the winning , secular faction is the green one . 
  if no one likes your country enough to immigrate the only way to get the people the country might need is by encouraging population growth at home . 
  the infrastructure was always a key aspect to this . 
  of course , the command economy could not sustain the welfare programs , military and other expenses in the long run . 
  well , most politicians seem to think so . 
  i am just saying there is more than one way to solve this , if this is considered an issue . 
  i am completely fine with the automation approach as well - a lower population density would be great to increase the standard of living . 
  the data for germany is missing for a long period of time , even tough it could shed some light on causes and possible action against this . 
  [ in this graph ] ( https://www.welt.de/img/politik/deutschland/mobile150041603/4381622267-ci23x11-w780/dwo-ip-geburtenziffer-db-1-jpg.jpg ) , black is west germany , gray is east germany , blue is the all of germany . 
  both parts of germany went through a drastic reduction in births when hormonal contraception became common in the mid sixties . 
  the east implemented policies to reverse this trend . 
  among those were the widespread availability kindergartens , both municipal and provided by the workplace or universities , that were staffed for the entire time the parents were working . 
  in addition to this , young families would get an interest free loan of 5000 marks to start a household , which would be reduced by 1000 for the first child another 1500 for the second and waived entirely for the third child . 
  keep in mind that at the same time contraception and abortion ( up to week 12 ) was freely available and about 90 percent of women were working . 
  the big drop comes with the end of this system and the general collapse . 
  the reversal in recent years coincides with the availability of daycare again : [ 86 percent of 2-3 year olds go to a kindergarten in the east , compared to 54 in the west ] ( http://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/1650.html ) . 
  our societies and politicians can solve low birth rates if we want to , or we could just do nothing and count on further immigration . 
   ca n't he just stab or shoot his wife like a ` normal ' person ? 
  that is what the perp did before tying the victim to his car - [ the hospital found knife stab injuries in her upper body .

  i suspect that question was not well formed and translated into a number of languages and legal systems . 
  there is a huge discrepancy between this and the more direct question qb8 .3 , about forcing a partner to have sex which was answered much more clearly at 96 % opposing this across europe .

  the soviet union received 5 % of the annual east german gdp to cover her occupation costs .

  you should be able to join in shortly . 
  even though it may not look that way , neuschwanstein is contemporary with the [ early skyscrapers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_skyscrapers ) in chicago and new york . 
  it also shares their construction methods - the throne room was build using a [ steel frame and had lifts and telephones in by design . 
  in the old days , ` marmelade ' was a jam in which all fruits were pureed and ` konfit\u00fcre ' one that still had pieces of fruit in it . 
  since the first one is more common , the general term in germany is ` marmelade ' . 
  along then came the country most bitterly complaining about intrusive eu regulations , thinking their bitter orange marmalade was the only one deserving this name and that this should be a fitting regulation imposed on everyone else . 
  while that is a worthwhile cause , there is always room for improvement - a deeper toilet offers more space to mount a camera to live stream all sorts of shit . 
  this design was very successful because it allowed self diagnosis for cholera , typhoid and similar diseases , when those were still around . 
  with modern diagnostics this is no longer the case , but it takes a while to replace it all . 
  the ratio of these vs normal toilet bowls offered for sale is around 1:10 these days . 
  more like leipzig . 
  germany currently has an [ intra-eu export surplus of about 72 billion $ ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/intra-eu_trade_in_goods_-_recent_trends ) . 
  why would i be ? 
  the data is not entirely consistent , because [ `` austria , estonia , greece , ireland , latvia , portugal and slovak republic are based on the spring ( second quarter ) european labour force survey '' ] ( https://www.oecd.org/employment/emp/annual-hours-worked.pdf ) . 
  the second quarter is usually one where overall employment rises , so the numbers might be slightly higher for these countries . 
  in addition to this there is a significant difference in the [ distribution of voluntary part time work in europe ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langid=en&amp;catid=1196&amp;newsid=2535&amp;furthernews=yes ) . 
  this is particularly prevalent in the benelux area , austria , germany and the uk . 
  it is also worth noting that france and germany have strong unions and collective bargaining , which is quite effective in regulating the hours per worker . 
  the naming of castles , palaces and similar mansions is sometimes fluid because castles were converted into residences when the castle 's defenses became obsolete . 
  no one really wanted to live in a cold and dark medieval castle keep by the time the renaissance came around . 
  this one was completed in 1914 though , and never had any defensive function . 
  inefficient . 
  it used to be [ one old man .

  keep in mind that for the german speaking areas the tradition of the [ journeyman years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/journeyman_years ) is not quite dead . 
  young people are expected to go out into the world to learn something new . 
  whose grandparents and parents already traveled a few hundred kilometers for their apprenticeship or study will hardly want to stay at home . 
  farage is not some sort of evil wizard who has more influence than all the other parties who opposed brexit . 
  the eu is flawed and in need of constant improvement , if we want to keep it . 
  the quickest way to destroy it is to ignore the critics and pretend any problems are made up by the british press , russian trolls or what ever the bogeyman of the day may be . 
  yes , let 's look at farage for a moment . 
  he has been elected to the ep since 1999 , has participated in parliamentary debates so intensely that politico named him [ `` one of the two most effective speakers in the chamber '' ] ( http://www.politico.eu/list/the-40-meps-who-actually-matter-european-parliament-mep/nigel-farage/ ) . 
  his greatest service is without a doubt , that he represented his voters and explained to the european public that there is growing dissatisfaction among the british voters about the state of the eu . 
  too bad so few people believed him before brexit . 
  that is exactly the point though . 
  your examples are all in the government , the executive . 
  the european parliament and its members are not part of the executive , they are the european legislative . 
  europe enjoys the separation of powers , like a proper democracy should . 
  needless to say , that includes the parliamentary opposition criticising the status quo and the executive in power . 
  the equivalent would not be the be the mayor , but the opposition to him in the city council .
