  but really , i do not care what happens to my body after i am dead . 
  it is an ossuary , where the bones are stored to let space on the graveyard be reused for the recently deceased . 
  [ there are plenty of those .

  take a look at doctors dressing up in africa : [ they are not using pressure suits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikp7ztaodly ) , but covering all of their skin to avoid direct contact with the patient . 
   ebola does not spread through coughing and sneezing ...  patient coughs , stuff gets inhaled by up-to-that-point healthy person , bam , infected . 
  can you spot the difference ? 
  ` ebola is not an airborne disease ' is what the [ who publicly reiterated in ghana ] ( http://ghanapolitics.net/ghana-news/ebola-is-not-an-airborne-disease-who.html ) earlier today . 
  somehow i do not see much room for interpretation there , but i am looking forward to you finding one . 
  but these reports from few years ago have not been substantiated . 
  the [ who ] ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/ ) , [ cdc ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html ) , [ rki ] ( http://www.rki.de/de/content/infaz/e/ebola/uebersicht.html#doc5045280bodytext3 ) all agree today that there is no airborne transmission . 
   what do these findings mean ? 
  first and foremost , ebola is not suddenly an airborne disease . 
  from that article you linked . 
  that is exactly the reason why he is still in germany and shall probably remain there even after a possible trial and conviction . 
  it did not take long for the state attorney to declare the suspect is a stateless person whose expulsion is suspended for humanitarian reasons , and who self identifies as palestinian . 
  [ ( source in local paper ) ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.derwesten.de%2fregion%2fbrandsaetze-auf-synagoge-in-wuppertal-geschleudert-id9648082.html&amp;edit-text= ), 
  no , the moment they took up arms , both sides were bound by the rules of international humanitarian law . 
  the rules for non-international armed conflicts are set in the [ second protocol to the geneva convention ] ( http://www.icrc.org/ihl/intro/475?opendocument ) . 
  there are several videos on the [ project 's site ] ( http://www.katrin.kit.edu/481.php ) . 
  it has been a while , though . 
  apart from the story being bullshit , an american working at a game preserve in brazil [ took that photo in 2011 ] ( http://patcegan.wordpress.com/2011/12/26/faces-with-roadmaps/old-man-face/ ) . 
  the international humanitarian law [ applies to non state actors as well ] ( http://globaljusticecenter.net/blog/?p=49 ) , the second protocol to the geneva convention covers conflicts with non state actors . 
  this is particularly valid for de-facto governments holding territory . 
  yes , 1.43 in the east vs. 1.36 in the west - that puts eastern germany in the same range as austria and italy . 
  to give you a sense of proportion , even down 2 million from 16 million still means east germany is larger than most countries in europe . 
  or just bad data mixed with prejudice . 
  the a net 2000 people left the east per year lately and the birth rate has exceeded that of the west since several years . 
  [ jahresbericht zum stand der deutschen einheit ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2013/jahresbericht_de_2013.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) , pages 94-96 , sorry , all in german since it is an internal german topic . 
  most of the esa space missions are earth observation related and directly benefit the countries involved . 
  if data relating to poland is being analysed for instance , the best place to do so is poland . 
  there is a substantial amount of knowledge and technology gained from the space program that needs to be transferred back to the local universities and economy . 
  involving more people in this should help everyone , including all the joint projects esa does . 
  most german political parties do not depend on facebook and other social networks as much . 
  usually , [ it is the smaller parties that are more active there ] ( http://www.fanpagekarma.com/facebook-ranking/deutsche-parteien ) , because that is a relatively cheap way to advertise and they have younger followers as well . 
  for a well paying job i would suggest combining mathematics and a natural science that interests you with a bit of humanistic education and social science . 
  the applied sciences and math create the technology everyone wants and pays for . 
  these days , creating technology is a cooperative process , so being able deal with people is essential . 
  this is where the humanities come in - other languages , classes that practice writing and speaking help bringing ideas across to other people and cultures . 
  in short , focus on a ` hard ' science you like and keep the ` soft ' ones in mind . 
  does the revolution end because one building is taken ? 
  the civil war was a continuation of the revolution , along with the red terror . 
  none of this contradicts marx . 
  roughly eight million dead lie between the assault on the winter palace and the founding of the soviet union . 
  i would not exactly call that little violence . 
  as previously mentioned , these sentences are from the final paragraph of the communist manifesto . 
  ` gewaltsamer umsturz ' is the exact phrase used - the revolutionary approach is the whole point of communism . 
  that is not intended either . 
   the communists disdain to conceal their views and aims . 
  they openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions . 
  the only solution is violence , as marx explicitly states in the communist manifesto . 
  sounds awfully familiar even in details . 
  the [ east german equivalent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_schalck-golodkowski ) lives a comfortable pensioner 's life . 
   ... dinamo bucharest football club , which was formerly the interior ministry 's football team . 
  [ dynamo berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_fc_dynamo ) is the police/stasi pet club . 
  that feeling is mutual . 
  in general , the idea used to be tarifautonomie - unions and employers negotiate wages with out interference by the government . 
  this meant that the negotiations and wages were adapted to the circumstances of the industry and the region . 
  one of the criticisms of this minimum wage is the one size fits all approach - the price levels in the rural east are different from large cities like frankfurt and munich . 
  living on what 8.5 euros per hours provides is quite a different experience depending on where you live . 
  it should also be mentioned that there are a number of exceptions based on party preferences . 
  the cdu did not want to lose popularity with their voter base in agriculture and screwed over the seasonal workers , the spd owns a substantial number of newspapers in germany and ensured that anyone delivering newspapers is paid below the minimum wage . 
  most of the deals between unions and employers are above this level , so not much would change for these . 
  the minimum wage is expected to impact roughly 3.7 million employees who might get higher pay or fired depending on the profitability of the industry they work in . 
  it says directly the article :  this happened after it was revealed a fifth of produce had been rejected by shops across the eu because it failed to meet the requirements . 
  even the [ commission 's press release ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_mex-08-0723_en.htm?locale=en ) following the repeal says :  in this era of high prices and growing demand , it makes no sense to throw these products away or destroy them . 
  this really was a bad piece of legislation that needed to go . 
  by the time this piece of joke legislation was repealed , [ 20 percent of the produce covered was rejected at the store and wasted ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8587496.stm ) . 
  the eu should not regulate this type of thing , and the fact that there has not been a breakdown of the vegetable market since it was repealed shows how unneccesary this legislation was in the first place . 
  that is very well possible , if i remember correctly we mostly had the czech version in east germany . 
  all i see is an [ old two-coloured ikarus bus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ikarus_bus#mediaviewer/file:ikarus_260.jpg ) that used to be everywhere in eastern europe . 
  this is also observable in the employment rates of women in former east and west germany - 80 percent of women in the east worked , 50 percent in the west did . 
  in addition to that , part time contracts were rare in east germany , so most women worked full time . 
  the state tried to compensate that with providing day care for every child , a paid day off per month to take care of the household and so on . 
  the flip side is that people were not free in their choice of profession - citizens had a duty to work and a right to work according to the requirements of the society . 
  people had to learn and work where the state saw a need , so people had to spend some time in a useful profession rather than becoming another liberal arts or social sciences major whining about not advancing in an engineering company . 
  glad to see the dutch going ahead with this , their antibiotics policy for humans is also worth implementing . 
  this would be a good topic to take up for the eu , since antibiotics resistant bacteria care little for our borders and affect us all the same .

  the other way around : in 1929 , berlin 's most well known [ burglars were german ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fbr%25c3%25bcder_sass&amp;edit-text= ) , the [ chief detective was jewish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernhard_wei%c3%9f_%28police_executive%29 ) and damn good at his job . 
  which is a bit ironic , since the opposition to nuclear power such as the german green party tries to defund research into new reactor types including fusion . 
  depends on what the motive is . 
  serious research is certainly different than a revisionist doing it for political gain . 
  that is the whole point , she wants to be seen applauding and knows this shall not impress the intellectuals anyway . 
  no , fantasizing up their own numbers is belittling the holocaust and brings a criminal charge for those involved , [ like this fine example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_williamson_%28bishop%29#jews_and_holocaust_denial ) . 
  the german military used [ methamphetamine tablets ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/crystal-meth-origins-link-back-to-nazi-germany-and-world-war-ii-a-901755.html ) ( pervitin ) massively in the war . 
  that successfully invaded [ several neighbouring charts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dune_%28band%29#singles ) . 
  [ the oecd has some data on that ] ( http://www.keepeek.com/digital-asset-management/oecd/taxation/taxing-wages-2014/tax-burdens-2013-estimates_tax_wages-2014-5-en#page1 ) - it is roughly 50 % for me in germany . 
  [ feldpost was censored and analysed ] ( http://www.feldpost-archiv.de/english/e11-zensur.html ) , it had to be positive and contain offical slogans . 
  thirty to forty thousand soldiers were sentenced in court-martials for subversive letters home . 
  of course the others wrote what the censor wanted to read . 
  without a doubt , it is one of the few american films for which a serious effort was made to replicate soviet hardware . 
  grew up in east germany , so school and state taught me everything is perfect in the soviet union ( and do n't i dare to say otherwise ) . 
  among other contacts , different members of my family went to technical comecon meetings there , are a russian teacher , attended the leningrad military academy . 
  there is plenty of news about the uighurs if one looks for it - but presumably that guy does not want to bite the hand that feeds him . 
  right , i have to give the author credit though , he seemed consequent enough to have moved to china . 
  seems to the ramblings of [ this guy ] ( http://cn.linkedin.com/in/ingarholst ) . 
  no sunni militant would link to baathist or even shia sites like that guy does . 
  of course not , that would be inefficient . 
  we 'll reprogram them to only drive east .
