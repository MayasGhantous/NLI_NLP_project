  you are right , not just dark green : the intervals are dark green - 140 , light green - 50 , yellow - 78 , light red - 99 , dark red - 684 . 
  it would be a shame if results could not be massaged to give the desired result . 
  previous attempts were made in many countries with nedap voting computers , which were proven to be manipulatable in minutes . 
  contrary to the manufacturer 's claim that this was impossible , the machine could be [ completely reprogrammed , even to play chess ] ( http://www.engadget.com/2006/10/06/dutch-voting-machines-hacked-to-play-chess/ ) . 
  brezhnev and honecker , none of those two shall be missed . 
  thanks for posting this though . 
  bulgaria was singled out for criticism , despite doing a better job than other nato countries . 
  it is all peanuts compared to the amounts of refugees in lebanon , turkey and other surrounding countries anyway . 
  there are over 4000 syrians in bulgaria . 
  for comparison , the us has so far taken in a generous [ 121 syrians ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/02/america-syria-refugee-resettlement-do-better-now ) , the uk around 500 . 
  they were quite willing as the butchery in ethiopia shows , it is their lacking capability that is ridiculed . 
  if it was freedom house or a similar organisation , i would agree , but iri is associated with the republican party and has a history intervening in other countries . 
  paid for by usaid and the [ international republican institute ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_republican_institute ) , so definitely the most unbiased survey one could find . 
  no , the people who voluntarily helped east germans flee were [ fluchthelfer ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/dieter_wohlfahrt ) , the ones who did so for profit were called [ schleuser ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritz_wagner_%28schleuser%29 ) ( trafficker ) . 
  that difference was usually ignored by the east german regime and its sympathisers . 
  the us did actually have tremendous and unprecedented amounts of support and goodwill after 9/11 , but the bush administration squandered it all with their unilateralism , attacking iraq and the crackdown on civil rights they lead in the western world . 
  actually , [ pakistan 's national assembly has had a 17.5 percent women 's quota ] ( http://www.na.gov.pk/en/composition.php ) since the seventies , which for some odd reason has not turned the country into paradise for women . 
  yeah , probably based on definition , maybe people get off the list at some point . 
  the unchr data in the second set i posted counts refugees , asylum seekers and everyone in a refugee-like situation . 
  it puts the total 1,797,600 for europe and 262,000 for states . 
  i do n't quite see where the number of 2.6 million in the us comes from . 
  that data does not quite add up with the unhcr data on [ asylum ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/5329b15a9.html ) and [ refugees ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/52a722c49.html ) . 
  you mean like [ eurotransplant ] ( http://www.eurotransplant.org/cms/ ) ? 
  that sounds about right . 
  there usually is a law for everything in germany . 
  ( where would it lead if we had not ? 
  / s ) what an acceptable name is comes from a collection of precedent cases and administrative rules . 
  [ the german wiki page on given names ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/vorname_%28deutschland%29 ) even has a list of unusual names and the related court cases . 
  one of the german guidelines for first names are that they should be chosen for the benefit of the child , not the self-portrayal of the parents . 
  that excludes brand , place and last names as given names . 
  if the name is common as a first name somewhere in the world , it is acceptable , but ` wikileaks ' exceeds every limit . 
  by my count 26 of 50 states in europe sent troops , what is your definition of ` most of ' ? 
  look at original post i responded to , nothing but appeals to emotion , insinuations and other rhetoric but surely i am the populist one . 
  [ on the contrary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multinational_force_-_iraq#troop_deployment_in_iraq_2003.c2.a0.e2.80.93+2011 ) , most of eastern ` new ' europe was all too eager to join invading iraq - significant contributions came from poland , georgia and ukraine . 
  that worked out particularly well when combating the numerous wmd in iraq and was the only reason for that invasion . 
  the operation in mali is actually un approved , so no point in trying to equate that . 
   invades a civilized country a crucial distinction , no doubt - one would not want to run out of excuses to justify one 's own invasions . 
  well , the website really is a wreck . 
  seriously though , the issue with them speaking french or any other european language is that this shows europeans that these murderers have gone through a modern european school system . 
  they grew up in europe 's liberal and secular societies , they were taught humanism and human rights . 
  they knew what putting a violent ideology above these rights leads to . 
  they still chose to do otherwise . 
  no idea , but he is entitled to [ another 378 $ for rent ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbeitslosengeld_ii#kosten_der_unterkunft_und_heizung_.28kdu.29 ) . 
  yes , among other expenses , the costs for rent , heating and warm water are paid when you are on hartz iv . 
  that time also counts towards the pension . 
  that is not attributable to modern nuclear energy use . 
  the wismut mines were started by the soviet military for their nuclear weapons program with forced labour shortly after the war . 
  that is why the mines had a horrible safety record , with 772 deaths . 
  of course , executing over 70 miners did not help either . 
  the projected cost is actually 6.4 billion euro until 2022 for cleaning 24 mines that ran for 40 years , so it is rather cheap . 
  for comparison , we shovelled roughly 20 billion euro in subsidies at the renewable energies last year . 
  the wahhabi 's stance on that might be slightly different and this disagreement part of the problem in europe : being a religious reactionary is accepted by many , as long as one is an immigrant religious reactionary . 
  good example , what are their laws based on ? 
   you 'd probably be jailed ... what for ? 
  all he describes is non violent behaviour and some food preferences . 
  the absorption of words form other languages into german has been discussed since the 17th century . 
  purists who complain and want to keep the language free of adopted words have been ridiculed since then - by icons of german literature like grimmelshausen and goethe no less . 
  oh come on , nothing to laugh at there . 
  [ a paper founded by francis fukuyama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_american_interest ) undoubtedly has an expert opinion on invading countries and making up excuses for it . 
  the eu should much more strictly follow the principle of subsidiarity - nothing should be decided at the eu level unless it is absolutely necessary . 
  there was much less resistance to the old eec which was rather focussed on transnational economic issues . 
  the further the political process is removed from the lives of the citizens it attempts to regulate the more they resent it . 
  for instance , [ directive 2000/9/ec ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/mechanical/documents/legislation/cableways/index_en.htm ) mandates that every region regulating traffic has to implement a law governing cable cars . 
  in germany , this forced each low lying bundesland without cable cars , mountains or , in the case of the city states , even the place to build one , to pass such law or pay a penalty of 800k $ per day . 
  one of the first things the german green and anti nuclear movement did [ was to ensure no reprocessing plant gets built ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_reprocessing_plant_wackersdorf ) . 
  then they started whining about spent fuel , transports to and from other reprocessing plants and now try to make certain there is no storage . 
  [ the most recent poll ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/umfragen-analysen/bundesweit/ard-deutschlandtrend/2014/maerz/ ) does not mention backing the the russian position . 
  most germans seem to expect heads of governments and diplomats to start negotiating . 
  as far as i can see , david is up in arms because someone tacked a fig leaf on him . 
  the imports from qatar , nigeria and so on mentioned in that document are the lng imports , that is compressed , cryogenic gas transported in tankers . 
  the pipelines deliver more and most comes from russia , see figure 2 . 
  [ most of central and eastern europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_in_the_european_energy_sector#natural_gas_deliveries ) relies heavily on russian gas . 
  good , i am really looking forward to more cuban rum . 
  sanctions only hit the common people anyway , and give those in power an excuse to blame the conditions they created on outside forces . 
  [ canada agreed to the same trade deal last year ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/european-union-canada-agree-free-trade-deal-115637607.html ) , including cheese names and as you posted above , still sells brie as brie . 
  no , what makes you think so ? 
  again , this is not about the eu stopping any producer from making a new type of cheese or selling it in europe . 
  it just can not be called an like an existing protected designation of origin . 
  brie is not a protected designation , so nothing would change for goat brie at all . 
  it is in fact , [ on sale in cheese shops ] ( http://www.lafromagerie.co.uk/brie-de-chevre/ ) all over europe and far from an american innovation that we can not have . 
  splendid , give it a unique name and offer it in europe , the eu is the largest cheese importer on the planet . 
  just label it properly , that is all this is about . 
  the us has similar provisions in [ nafta ] ( http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/chap-034.asp ) ( annex 313 ) to protect local whisky manufacturers and accepts to protect the canada 's and mexico 's specialties . 
  this is a normal part of the negotiations for free trade and would likely be reciprocally applied to unique american cheeses such as monterrey jack and cheese curds as well . 
  considering some of the cheese i tried in the states introducing the european naming conventions would be protecting the consumers everywhere . 
  the values seem a bit off on this and the reason is that as usual the news have only half the story . 
  [ the study ] ( http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.438708.de/14-9.pdf ) does not count the value of goods used in private households including furniture and cars but includes the credit used to buy these . 
  cash and entitlements from health and retirement funds are not included either . 
  using this method , a household which rents a flat , buys expensive furniture and car is considered poor , one that spends all money on an empty house is considered rich . 
  germany is not excited to see people emigrate , but we like to see that those who went somewhere else made a positive contribution to their new home and humanity as whole . 
  that is particularly true of the [ many germans who went to the us ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_bekannter_deutscher_usa-emigranten ) . 
  we have taken back a number of [ volga germans whose ancestors settled in russia centuries ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_germans ) their reintegration generally went very well . 
  updated the link in the post , the previous one was wrong . 
  it is quite well documented that the then serbian state was involved . 
  politics were quite a bit different back then . 
   ... it would be carried out by a serbian terrorist who was on the payroll of the serbian secret police . 
  not just secret police , the [ black hand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_hand_%28serbia%29 ) was interwoven with the state . 
  by modern definitions , 1914 serbia was a state sponsor of terrorism . 
  edit : corrected the link to the wiki . 
  the government should not have the exclusive right of legislative initiative .
