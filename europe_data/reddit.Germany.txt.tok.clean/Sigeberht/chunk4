  giving the opposition the possibility to introduce their own proposals for bills is an important tool in the democratic process - it ensures that the opinions of a wider segment of society are represented in parliament . 
  it is good to see some progress in the election of the commission , we need more democratic elements in the eu political system . 
  britain is not part of the schengen area either , yet they manage . 
  free movement of capital and services should be part of the free trade agreement , not the bilateral treaties . 
  the reaction to this referendum is quite exaggerated . 
  in the eu , the legislative , the eu parliament does not have the right of legislative initiative - the people we vote for to represent us in european politics can not propose new laws . 
  instead , the eu commission , the executive that is supposed to be checked and balanced by parliament , has the sole right of legislative initiative . 
  of course , we can not vote for the commission either , because they are appointed by the european council , the heads of national governments . 
  parliament may vote on a commission candidate the council presents , but not propose a new or different one . 
  clearly , there is nothing wrong with democracy in the eu at all , the blame squarely lies with the internet and politicians who dare to criticize the eu . 
  the guillotine clause is part of the [ bilateral treaties which were negotiated as bundle since 1999 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/switzerland%e2%80%93european_union_relations#treaties ) . 
  if one of these , like the free movement of people is ended , the other seven treaties from that list may be ended as well . 
  it does not cover any other treaty . 
  if the swiss government decides to renegotiate and those negotiations fail , either the swiss or the eu may invoke the guillotine clause and end the group of treaties mentioned . 
  no , it does not . 
  there is no precedent that allows any party to act randomly . 
  international law has [ tribunals to arbitrate interstate disputes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/permanent_court_of_arbitration ) , to deal with situations like this , should no solution be found in direct negotiations . 
  it is a disgrace particularly since the eu was founded to deal with european disputes in a fair and lawful manner , not to push around other states like russia does . 
  switzerland gained access to the european market in the [ free trade agreement signed 1972 , not in the bilateral treaties ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/switzerland/ ) that were signed in 1999 and 2004 . 
  ( and the eu gains more from that trade . ), 
  the guillotine clause only covers the bilateral agreements that were negotiated as a bundle . 
  it does not cover any treaty ever signed . 
  it is inappropriate of some eu officials to threaten the exclusion of switzerland from free trade . 
  he certainly meant this entirely serious . 
  this is not going to be a watershed moment for the eu - switzerland is not even a member nation . 
  what might come up is the renegotiation of the bilateral treaties , bringing things back to the state of before 2000 , when the recently repealed immigration rules came into effect . 
  no , western power is not slipping away from its politicians , they gambled it away during the past decade in all the botched invasions in the middle east and neighbouring regions . 
  this , coupled with a constant assault on the civil rights of the citizens in the nato countries makes these citizens unwilling to waste even more money on both killing people overseas and having their rights reduced even more efficiently . 
  [ then as now ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/the_strenuous_life ) , invading small countries is usually not a glorious triumph but never let doubt or reason stop jingoism . 
  not quite , [ erler , the new appointee ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gernot_erler ) , is experienced in east european politics and languages and held a similar role in merkel 's government in 2005 . 
  [ schockenhoff , who is replaced ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/andreas_schockenhoff ) , is mainly known for his drunkenness and approval of some russians beating up a gay rights demonstration in 2006 . 
  all links are in german because these guys are not really well known politicians . 
  i would argue that schockenhoff in particular is backbencher who got in over his head . 
   what about german olive oil we recommend changing it after 50000 km . 
  that might have been the case in the past . 
  since radium is no longer used as fluorescent or additive to toothpaste and similar quackeries , polonium has slightly more relevance today . 
  its high rate of decay makes it useful some types of nuclear generators for spacecraft and its strong alpha radiation is used to ionize air to reduce static electricity in some industrial processes . 
  [ r\u00f6hm and much of the of the sa leadership ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ernst_r%c3%b6hm#sa_leader ) were openly gay . 
  looks like they messed up the data on the website quite a bit ( north korea for example ) . 
  the downloadable data does not have these issues and includes all the countries that are missing . 
  contrary to what most people seem to think , islamic banking is indeed closely associated with islamism , particularly of the muslim brotherhood in egypt and the jamaat-e-islami in pakistan . 
  if that was not bad enough , sharia compliant banking should also be opposed because it is being used to screw over the muslim bank customers even worse than they would be in usual banks . 
  no matter what they claim , islamic banks do exactly the same business as other ones and are in it for profit . 
  they just cover their actions with religious excuses . 
  it is the bank that hires a mullah as sharia consultant , he works for them , not the customer . 
  a conflict with an islamic bank can easily turn from a business dispute into a religious one as well . 
  a while ago , tarek fatah has [ summed up the criticism of islamic banking quite nicely ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/tarek-fatah/sharia-banking_b_1011704.html ) . 
  definitely by the common market . 
  at a quick glance , there are foods from at least ten other eu countries in my kitchen alone . 
  this is also related to the common agricultural policy , of course . 
  it is ironic that juno , the most powerful roman goddess with one of the richest mythologies , is reduced to a pair of breasts by a feminist . 
   now tell me the difference between terrorism and freedomfighting . 
  the difference is victory . 
  this exactly , [ korn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korn_%28liquor%29 ) is popular in the german north , and quite literally drunken in combination with beer . 
  `` what happens if the central economic planning commission were sent into the desert ? '', 
  ( sending someone into the desert means sending them packing in german ) `` nothing would improve , but there shall be a shortage of sand . '', 
  an east german asks a party secretary : `` comrade , who came up with socialism , a politician or a scientist ? '', 
  `` a politician , of course . '', 
  `` i thought so , a scientist would have experimented on rats . '', 
  a citizen wants to buy shoes , but mistakenly enters a butchery next door : `` oh , you have no shoes here . '', 
  the butcher replies , `` they have no shoes next door ; here , we have no meat . '', 
  that law was only valid for the common brewers - the same duke granted the monopoly right to brew wheat beer to the count of degenberg as a political favour and for a yearly payment . 
  later , when the count died without heirs , that monopoly fell back to the grandson of the duke ( maximilian iv . ), 
  who took over the breweries , made selling his beer mandatory and laughed all the way to the bank . 
  quite simply , gorbachev announced the end of the [ brezhnev doctrine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brezhnev_doctrine ) . 
  the only thing keeping eastern europe in communism was the threat of soviet invasion . 
  giving up the d-mark and joining the euro was france 's price for german reunification . 
  this is such common knowledge that is [ listed in the wiki with tons of references ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_euro#relaunch ) . 
  it did not quite work out the way they imagined . 
  looks like krugman ran out baltic republics to write down after they dared not follow his predictions of doom . 
  if european citizens feel unrepresented , the obvious answer is a more powerful bureaucracy . 
  clearly , the the most pressing issue the eu has , is to consolidate the position of the president of the european council and the commission . 
  it could not possibly have to do with a lack of democracy . 
  thanks for mentioning this , it is not entirely clear from the article . 
  an expatriate already has a job before entering the foreign country . 
  most are sent abroad by their companies . 
  that is bit different than immigrating to find employment later . 
  i hope we get to see more chinese films in return , too . 
  how much the top 1 percent own ( 40 % ) has nothing to do with appointments to eu functions . 
  there are checks and balances in the eu administration to prevent that each group from becoming too powerful , and other states do exactly the same . 
  what is the evidence that the german administrators are in powerful positions , but the belgian , french , italian or spanish ones are not ? 
  each of these countries contributes about 10 percent of the high level staff . 
  it would be wrong to attribute the only skill in politics to germans in general and merkel in particular , to achieve position as overpowering as has been claimed . 
  in fact , a number of german politicians who ended up in eu offices are former rivals of merkel , such as oettinger and stoiber - they are in exile in brussels . 
  do you seriously give credence to the claim that the 10 percent of german administrators ` run brussels ' and put it in ` merkel 's grip ' ? 
  this article is summed up by a prediction of doom from nigel farange , by the way . 
  indeed , i read the article and found it misleading . 
  the numbers do tell the story , the key positions are ones with higher pay - if one compares the relevant pay grades ( ad13 to ad16 , higher administrators ) , those add up to the roughly 10 percent in the story . 
  however , as even the article points out :  germans make up 16 percent of the bloc 's 507-million population . 
  90 percent of the high administration are not staffed by a german , that is not having a grip on brussels , nor running it . 
  germans make 8.4 percent of the [ eu commission 's administration ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm ) , compared to belgians with 18.3 , italy with 10.3 and france with 9.7 percent . 
  clearly , it is the germans who have overrun everything . 
  to name just the two largest sources of refugees at the moment : there are about 2.7 million afghan refugees in pakistan and iran , 1.5 million syrian ones in lebanon , jordan , turkey and other neighbouring countries . 
  is that asian enough for you ? 
  bananas must be `` free from malformation or abnormal curvature of the fingers '' as per [ commission implementing regulation ( eu ) no 1333/2011 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2011:336:0023:01:en:html ) which replaced [ commission regulation ( ec ) no 2257/94 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:31994r2257:en:html ) . 
  the requirements have been the same since 1994 . 
  no matter what the bbc says , this is not something the daily mail dreamt up . 
  of course not , the correct metric is obviously litres per hour . 
  intensity makes a difference in perception - the occasional plane crash with a few hundred dead makes the news , the thousands of deaths in car accidents at the same time are ignored . 
  actually , the article mentions the bloodiest battle , not the biggest .
