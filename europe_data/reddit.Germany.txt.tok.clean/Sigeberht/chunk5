  the battle of stalingrad lasted for more than 5 months , the one in leipzig just three days . 
  on average , 30000 died per day in leipzig compared to about 12300 per day in stalingrad . 
  that is quite intense bloodshed , even by modern standards . 
  the only metal in the [ ` liberator ' ] ( http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/06/the-liberator-the-first-completely-3d-printed-gun-gets-fired/ ) prototype is a common nail as firing pin . 
  of course , that was just a consumer level 3d printer . 
  industrial ones use electron beam and laser sintering - those can form steel and titanium . 
  that killing citizens is legal in certain condisions does mean it is acceptable . 
  however , eton 's question , particularly since it quotes machiavelli and puts everything decades in the future becomes whole lot less spectacular . 
  the clause in the echr has been used in the past and can be used again any day . 
  reality is worse than the scenario eton came up with . 
  [ article 2 of the echr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_2_of_the_european_convention_on_human_rights ) provides exemptions from the right to life for states to kill people for an escape attempt during imprisonment and to quell riots . 
  the question eton asked is well within current european law . 
  of course , what exactly a riot is has not been accurately defined , but our glorious governments would never abuse powers like these . 
  the [ charit\u00e9 ] ( http://www.charite.de/ ) is the university medicine in berlin - the fact that their boss is busy playing politics with the german government does make them private or incompetent . 
  of course , tymoshenko represents one of the worst fears of most politicans - to be held accountable for their actions in office one day . 
  fantastic research - the [ genographic project ] ( https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/human-journey/ ) has some more maps and information related to earlier human migration . 
  crimethink is doubleplus ungood . 
  this is quite similar in germany as well , though fire is not usually not tolerated in forests . 
  the churches in east germany offered a protected space because of their connection to the west german ones - the stasi and police would usually not openly attack gatherings there , because of the bad pr this might cause in the west . 
  their privileges helped , not their ideas . 
  in a way , merkel 's minimum wage is the salary she receives as a member of parliament , the chancellor 's pay is an [ additional income ] ( http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete17/biografien/m/merkel_angela.html ) . 
  splendid , the instead of demanding everyone else to take care of it , let the church house them and pay for them , it is not like they are short on real estate or money . 
   `` our ancestors got nothing , they got their freedom and they were told ` go develop yourselves . ' '' '', 
  that was exactly the same the european 's ancestors received when serfdom was abolished . 
  try working like they did . 
  there is a [ catholic ] ( http://www.kirchliche-immobilien.de/entry/view?id=353&amp;td[]=td1&amp;sort=s1 ) and a [ lutheran ] ( http://www.kirchengrundstuecke.de/th/w/g/585.html ) church for sale if anyone needs a larger house in the german countryside . 
  usually small , local breweries have the most interesting brews , among others for instance , [ this one in fulda ] ( http://www.wiesenmuehle.de/brauerei.htm ) or [ this one in thuringia , which even still uses a steam engine ] ( http://www.brauerei-schmitt.de/ ) . 
  sorry the pages are all in german , their reach is very regional , of course . 
  declaring just means saying something publicly and officially - that is what the king did . 
  he did not decide this , of course , but there is a certain irony in the person receiving the most public funds delivers a speech about austerity and self responsibility . 
  just for comparison , the german president gets about 200.000 $ per year . 
  of all people , the one who receives a ton of money for the great personal achievement of being the first born declares the end of the welfare state . 
  you could not make it up . 
  their program explicitly demands a stop to the banks , hedge funds and major investors cashing in on the bailout at the tax payers expense . 
  talk about completely ignoring reality . 
  diplomatic immunity is not the same for every level of diplomat . 
  there is no indication at what level the ones in the story were accredited , if they were at all . 
  i would not be surprised if these folks were just members of a european parliament who are issued a diplomatic passport - a passport alone does not grant any immunity . 
  we have to give the allies some credit - speer only said that [ after the raid on schweinfurt ] ( http://www.airforcemag.com/magazinearchive/pages/2010/february%202010/0210schweinfurt.aspx ) , which targeted one of the largest ball bearing plants . 
  this might be related to a lack of germany during that period . 
  [ lehman brothers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehman_brothers#bankruptcy ) are not doing quite well any more , same as that other bank . 
  sparkassen and the landesbanken related to them are directly financed by the tax payers of the area they operate in . 
  if anything , they need to be barred from investment banking . 
  anything containing atoms or genes is obviously evil and yes , they are insane . 
  they know that fusion research is a waste of money before it even started [ ( page 36 ) ] ( http://www.gruene.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dokumente/gruenes-bundestagswahlprogramm-2013.pdf ) , after all , the money to prove quackeries has to come from somewhere . 
  those countries will get there eventually . 
  europe 's strength is cooperation - organisations like cern , eso , esa and so on make it easier to join high level science , even on a small budget . 
  indeed , a bioconservative coalition is the last we need . 
  germany has no natural resources to sell and lives off high quality goods created with research and engineering . 
  as a consequence , [ almost every political party in german supports better funding for education and science ] ( http://scienceblogs.de/frischer-wind/2013/09/15/wahlprogramme-2013-forschungsforderung/ ) . 
  the notable exception is the green party which intends to outlaw research using animals , particularly primates , and nuclear research including fusion , up to leaving iter and euratom . 
  they also favour mandating ideological research such as ` proving ' complementary medicine , to name just a highlight . 
  in short , there is likely going to be increased investment in r&d in germany , unless the luddites come to power . 
  i was wondering that about spain , too . 
  it turns out the graph is coloured according to who sends most students , but is actually bidirectional , to make things more confusing . 
  if you mouse over the germany to france one , it tells you the details , germany to france : 4555 ; france to germany : 2971 . 
  i see what you mean - in germany , those laws are more of a framework which sets the borders within which both employers and employees may act . 
  the actual vacation duration for instance , is not something that is enforced on businesses against their will . 
  most agree to 30 days of paid vacation in collective bargaining with the unions , far exceeding the 20 days minimum mandated by law . 
  no matter what salon thinks ` even the austerity-minded german political leadership ' does not touch this because it considers this a result of free negotiations on the labour market . 
  much to the displeasure of the left , there is no minimum wage in germany , yet the overall salaries are comparatively high . 
  cooperation is more important than confrontation , particularly in german labour relations . 
  another example would be [ kurzarbeit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_time ) . 
  a company could legally fire a number of its employees in a recession , but they and their skills would be missing when the economy goes up again . 
  a well rested workforce with decent job security is more productive and more profitable than one that is miserable , especially in high level manufacturing . 
  luther said : ` pray as if all work was in vain and work , as if all prayer was in vain . ', 
  we kept the second part after figuring out the efficiency of prayer . 
  [ calvin put a big emphasis on punctuality ] ( http://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/article/how-calvin-invented-punctuality-500-years-ago/ ) , the other protestants copied that from him . 
  on the contrary - the absence of government intervention is exactly what drives german labour relations , for instance . 
  it is even specifically outlawed in the constitution for the state to interfere with the negotiations ( tarifautonomie ) . 
  this may just be an indication that it has become too expensive to raise a family on a single income . 
   he had searched hitler 's base in munich , the f\u00fchrerbau for souvenirs and found the ring in the flooded basement of the building . 
  what a cute way to put it . 
  it is called looting . 
  yours is a most brilliant display of german nationalism : the deep pondering over what it means to be german , the negativity of the outcome and the urge to impose it on everyone . 
  lighten up a little . 
  i was expecting the people 's front of judea . 
  the [ official statistic ] ( http://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/statischer-content/statistische-analysen/analytikreports/zentrale-analytikreports/monatliche-analytikreports/generische-publikationen/analyse-arbeitsmarkt-auslaender/analyse-arbeitsmarkt-auslaender-201307.pdf ) says that german companies employ 2.2 million foreigners , but let 's go with something someone said in another thread and assume it is impossible . 
  it is all the fault of the npd of course , the politicians in office who first closed the neighbourhood school and later placed refugees there are not responsible at all . 
  that idea is just as good as [ placing large numbers of refugees in small villages ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/asylum-seekers-outnumber-locals-in-german-village-a-844818.html ) . 
  we could just let them find a job and rent their own place , but that might actually solve the problem . 
  this is the same game of ` old ' and ` new ' europe that the bush administration played when they intended to go war with a middle eastern country over alledged weapons of mass destruction . 
  i wonder when they start renaming english dishes in washington again . 
  d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu i can believe in . 
  the annoying part is really the stealth introduction of halal meat . 
  this is playing favourites with religions , because [ hindus and sikhs are opposed to ritual slaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jhatka ) . 
  what makes one religion more worthy of respect than the other ? 
  good question , i found that interesting as well , particularly since that statue looks more like athena with her headdress and shield . 
  it turned out to be a [ helmet in the roman style ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/grande_commande#les_quatre_parties_du_monde ) and not strictly related to classical antiquity . 
   publishers are n't sure what they want of course they are . 
  they want everyone to hand money to them : google for providing their marketing , libraries for lending their texts , people buying copiers , scanners and printers and their readers for shoving advertisements down their throat . 
  it was introduced when [ franz ii . 
  was still emperor of the holy roman empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gott_erhalte_franz_den_kaiser ) , so do n't complain it is used in the whole area he used to represent . 
  ludwig adolf wilhelm von l\u00fctzow , a hero of the wars against napoleon , actually has a [ poem to his name ] ( http://freiburger-anthologie.ub.uni-freiburg.de/fa/fa.pl?cmd=gedichte&amp;sub=show&amp;noheader=1&amp;add=&amp;id=467 ) by [ theodor k\u00f6rner ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theodor_k%c3%b6rner ) . 
  the music that made it into a song later came from [ carl maria von weber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_maria_von_weber ) . 
  the colours of his [ free corps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%bctzow_free_corps ) are the ones that gave inspiration to the german flag . 
  edit : fun with hyperlinks ending in ), 
  iraq was not . 
  the last time germany was interventionist and expansive there were numerous complaints and this is reflected in the present . 
  the german basic law and the penal law prohibit any military action that is not based on defence or an un resolution .
