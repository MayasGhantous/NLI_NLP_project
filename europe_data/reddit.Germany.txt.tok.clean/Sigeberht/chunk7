  the wider the ownership is spread , the less the individual potential gains or loses - if it spread to the entire society , most people are not going to bother , because they actually would spend more time making the decision than it 's impact would cost them . 
  it is this lack of incentive to vote or care for communally owned property that concentrates power in the hands of those that are entrusted with it . 
  if the stakeholder 's control fails , who is going to replace it ? 
  if it is the state or a government office , we are back to square one . 
  as of the escalated point - that actually was the case when the german postal and similar services were not yet privatized . 
  a communist , based on the mere membership in the party , was ineligible to do even a simple job like delivering a letter . 
  this law was passed by a social democratic government , with no less . 
  it certainly looks that way . 
  there were plenty of socialist countries that did not follow marxist-leninist or even maoist doctrine - none of them could provide as good a standard of living as capitalist ones can . 
  calling others dumb says more about the quality of your argument than mine , by the way . 
  many of the communist and ex-communist parties have taken up advocating socialism after their previous attempt failed , so i would not agree that is exclusive to social democrats . 
  i have had enough socialism to last me a life tough . 
  if the means of production are socialized , they will end up being controlled by the state , its bureaucracy or something similar . 
  in effect , this consolidates political and economic power even more - political opposition becomes an economic risk and opposition the state 's economic activities becomes sedition . 
  that model brings society further from democracy . 
  no , the word used was not ` social ' , but ` socialist ' . 
  there is a difference between the two . 
  implementing social reforms or services not quite the same as changing the ownership of the means of production - which is exactly why i was criticising the use of that word . 
  more socialism is a brilliant way to put it , because that worked out so well for eastern europe the last time it was tried . 
  how about we try more democracy instead , all of europe might have gone the same route as iceland with the banks paying for the mess they caused instead of the citizens . 
  of course it is not literally non-understandable , i was referring to the tendency of bureaucrats to complicate things . 
  no one would use a compound word this large in every day speech or writing - it is not a regular feature of the german language . 
  a single approach might not fit every country and i suspect that the method would have to be adapted to the each country . 
  i am sure you would have a better idea what works for romania than i do . 
  it is the bureaucracy that comes up with words like these , that is the last place i would expect sanity from . 
  they could just have gone with `` gesetz zur \u00dcbertragung der \u00dcberwachungsaufgaben der rinderkennzeichnung und rindfleischetikettierung '' - but then citizens might actually understand what they talk about , and we ca n't have that . 
  it does not have to be a government agency - this program could be run by health insurances as well . 
  they stand to save a lot of money for everyone involved when the children they insure stay healthy . 
  this sounds like a good idea to implement everywhere . 
  the report mentions that in 2012 in europe 17 people were murdered in terrorist attacks . 
  one by the ira , one by corsican separatists . 
  the other 15 , 88 percent , were slain by jihadis in the name of islam . 
  so if you want to spin this statistic into showing muslim terrorists are the greatest terrorist danger , that works just as well . 
  surely this would provide the best justice money can buy . 
   sunday 22 july 2012 nothing is as old as yesterday 's news . 
  including publishers like axel springer and bauer among the left leaning ones is certainly unusual - they are seen as right , conservative or yellow press over here . 
  no veto , no money does not really scare anyone in the rest of the world , though . 
  [ japan and germany already contribute more than france , britain and china ; spain , italy , brazil and canada more than russia . 
  ] ( http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=st/adm/ser.b/910 ) maybe we should have a 5 % limit - if a state does not provide more than 5 % of the un budget , it does not get a veto .

  the article is talking about a [ few hours in during the photovoltaic generation maximum . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ck5-cz0w8aadoo5.png:large ) the exact opposite - some 80 gw from fossil fuel and 10 gw from renewables - could be said about some november days , when the weather conditions are unfavourable for solar and wind use . 
  yet there were no substantial changes in power plant capacity in half a year . 
  that is the issue i have with news like this : a few hours of nice weather turn into `` yay , renewables ! '', 
  awesome , is n't it ? 
  too bad the other 364 days of the year are not mid summer weekend days with unusually favourable weather conditions . 
  in reality , about 26 % are renewable , 16 % nuclear and the rest of german electricity generation comes from fossil sources . 
  no one has 22 billion just lying around . 
  the interest payments are 0.5 % above the rate the other countries pay and for a number of loads have been frozen for 10 years . 
  even then , it is uncertain if the loans can be paid back at all , if the imf is to be believed . 
  europe has already given greece another bailout of 84 billion euros , germany 's share is 22 billion . 
  those 22 billion come from the german budget , which means the budget short that amount . 
  to make up for that shortfall , germany could take on more debt , passing the bill to a future generation , cut back on spending when she is already short on infrastructure investments or raise taxes as described . 
  so much that first experts are [ recommending tax raises or more austerity in germany ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.faz.net%2faktuell%2fwirtschaft%2feurokrise%2fgriechenland%2fsteuern-in-deutschland-wegen-griechenland-erhoehen-13704731.html ) to pay for the money sent to greece . 
  in short , all of germany pays the equivalent of a 3.5 % income tax raise , this will be similar in other countries .

   gsk has committed to a not-for-profit price for the vaccine so that , if approved , the price would cover the cost of manufacturing the vaccine together with a small return of around 5 % that will be reinvested in research on malaria and neglected tropical diseases .
