  i never heard of it boiled , it was used as a sweetener or ingredient though . 
  very useful for all sorts of [ home made liqueur ] ( http://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/2108511340038580/schokolikoer.html ) , apparently . 
  that seems to be a religious favourite , the same thing is in the [ new testament ] ( http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm ) . 
  there are less people who take that dead serious though . 
  it is quite uncommon in the protestant areas - luther criticised canonisation and all the business surrounding it . 
  the counter-reformation then popularized name days to differentiate the catholic rite . 
  yes , it was called a chauffeur . 
  yes , but it is someone else 's chronic shortage . 
  as long as the aid is sufficient for the recent government and its power base , the general public can and shall stay poor . 
  only when their own wealth and power depends on the well being of the public , will these regimes move . 
  that aid keeps the countries going is exactly what mwenda is criticising ( [ long version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gei7pdrvc9m ) ) - there is no incentive for the local governments to actually work with their population and generate a working economy and tax revenue . 
  some countries have been a dump for decades , keeping to throw money at them will change nothing except the account balances of the usual suspects . 
  they have no need to change if there is no incentive . 
  reminds me of a [ ted talk on aid to africa ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mwenda_takes_a_new_look_at_africa?language=en ) i saw a while ago . 
  if finland 's example catches on , a lot of people in the aid industry and the kleptocrats they funnel money to have to get a proper job . 
  good job by the doctors and health authorities tough , checking for and diagnosing a disease not seen in several decades . 
  the austrian abgb is another good example for the early codifications of civil law , indeed . 
  yeah , there are other legal traditions that were incorporated and almost a hundred years between the code civil and the bgb . 
  however , they copied a lot of ideas from the code civil to the bgb , particularly because the former was the civil law in many west german states, 
   and the b\u00fcrgerliches gesetzbuch , its direct descendant not really , the bgb unified the different laws in use in the german states unified in 1871 - the translated code civil was one of the laws it replaced . 
  prussia already had a the [ allgemeines landrecht f\u00fcr die preu\u00dfischen staaten ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_state_laws_for_the_prussian_states ) in 1794 . 
  the payments are at the minimum of existence in germany - however , there are a number of regulations that prevent them from getting a job easily . 
  a lot of that red tape is starting to be removed though . 
  it is roughly in the range of the social security payments to the long term unemployed . 
  one can get by , but the lifestyle certainly has to be frugal . 
  depends on how big the household is . 
  [ a single person gets 216 $ in expenses and 143 $ in cash , more for additional family . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fasylbewerberleistungsgesetz&amp;edit-text= ), 
  good hear there were less injuries than reported . 
  well the other [ two helicopters had the the prime minister , half the government and the military leadership ] ( http://www.dawn.com/news/1180757/norway-philippines-envoys-killed-in-helicopter-crash-army-claims-no-terror-attack ) in them . 
  flying there in this region is always a risk , gilgit is the place where hindukush , karakoram and himalayas meet.while i trust the pilot 's ability , the maintenance in pakistan is often less than stellar . 
  edit : seems to involve the [ romanian ambassador ] ( http://tribune.com.pk/story/883013/three-injured-as-helicopter-crashes-in-gilgit/ ) as well . 
  indeed , in the short term , immigration works . 
  in the long run , policies like the one you mention make more of a difference - the immigrants usually adapt to the situation in the country they move to . 
  yes , if we do n't see the bright side , how do we get there ? 
  the world has already seen much improvement in these areas , particularly recently . 
  we should continue making it better , no reason to become complacent now . 
  not that i disagree , i would say that access to education is part of what defines the standard of living in a country . 
  immigration is not the answer because birth rates are falling all over the world , usually in conjunction with rising standards of living . 
  exceptions are areas recovering from a war or similar devastation . 
  a good place to get an overview is hans rosling 's excellent [ gapminder ] ( http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majormode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=c$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2013$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=xcoords;iid=0arfedsv3bbwccghbd2noqvz1ewownvpsnjl1c3lrswc;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=ycoords;iid=phawcnavuyj0taljecezcgq;by=ind$inc_s;univalue=8.21;iid=phawcnavuyj0xoobl_n5taq;by=ind$inc_c;univalue=255;gid=catid0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;datamin=2;datamax=756$map_y;scale=lin;datamin=0.836;datamax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds= ) , set to show countries with less infant mortality generally have lower fertility . 
  nothing needs to be done from my perspective - societal and technological progress happens when people are rare and precious to society , not when an inexhaustible supply of cheap labour can be thrown at any problem . 
  when it is released , i 'll take another look . 
  there is no issue with having several browsers installed anyway . 
  sounded like it is supposed to be done by the end of 2015 last i checked - i 'll keep an eye on it . 
  in typical german fashion , the ad-blocking and privacy plugins are the ones i care about most - i would not have changed if those had not been available . 
  having used firefox for ages , i recently switched over to chrome . 
  the close to single threaded architecture in firefox annoys me to no end - when ever a web site hangs , the entire browser comes crashing down . 
  that is not happening in chrome or even ie these days . 
  firefox might be worth another look when the electrolysis project ( fixing the threading ) is complete . 
  however , the plugins are available on chrome too and integration into android is so good that i probably wo n't switch back . 
  the first corridas i saw were decades ago in m\u00e9xico [ ( recent ones here ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uczizwtxw0wgxm-ccypefgcw ) - i consider them an art , a ritual that confronts its viewers with death and mortality , both their own and their food 's . 
  none of those are appealing topics to many people , especially today . 
  the latter in particular is nicely hidden away behind the divided and delegated responsibilities of our food supply chain . 
  seeing a bull killed for you in person , knowing its name and weight is quite different to picking up a cleanly packaged piece of meat in the supermarket . 
  we kill to live and few animals get as honest a treatment as the bulls in the corrida . 
  not just technically - \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 should be translated as heimat . 
  that is not too far off the actual propaganda slogans that were used . 
  if the alternatives are upholding the law and a wrong , but convenient action of the police , there is no lesser evil . 
  from my perspective , that is the case in both of these events - police making failing to protect basic rights to make life easier for themselves . 
  [ this is happening again ] ( http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/twsfp/2009/01/german_police_take_down_israel.asp ) , there were previous instances and i would be surprised if it did not occur again . 
  of course our politicians cheered them on , they do the same thing . 
  for instance , the [ german order of merit has a contingent set aside for each legislature , and is given out to the parties proportionally to their seats in the bundestag ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2fordenvergabe-an-politiker-das-bundesproporzkreuz-a-733908.html&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  [ that is the point . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_asia_transcontinental.png ), 
  so pretty much like cyprus , except that georgia at least has some actual territory in europe . 
  this subreddit seriously has an automoderator that deletes comments regarding some he-whose-name-must-not-be-mentioned ? 
  that is shockingly wrong . 
  considering this seems to turn into a regional argument - there is a long tradition in the german speaking areas of leaving home in early years going back to medieval times . 
  the apprentice would leave home and live with the family of the master he learned from . 
  when he became proficient enough he would become a [ journeyman and travel around ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/journeyman_years ) to learn from different masters , while being banned from coming closer than about 50 km to his home town . 
  only a master was allowed to settle and open shop where he wanted . 
  needless to say , the same thing goes for students as well - they were travelling so much that they were given the right to bear arms in the hre . 
  the same thing seems to have been the case in france , continuing today . 
  the bakery i shop in takes in exchange apprentices and they only came from france so far . 
  ( not that i am complaining , the french pastry they bake is awesome . ), 
  so in short , we have always moved out early in life to learn and work , no matter the circumstances . 
  the point is to move where there is work and education and to make compromises there . 
  staying where your parents happen to live and waiting for opportunities at that place is hardly as successful . 
  besides , the experience in teamwork and conflict resolution gained by living with a group of complete strangers is not different to working with complete strangers . 
   where you can start some average job that somehow lets you to live with other ( strangers at first ) people in some ( often ) shitty flat with couple of rooms . 
  oh no , what a horrible fate . 
  that is the standard for university students in the german speaking countries and many young professionals , particularly in the big cities . 
  some 4 million people share flats in germany alone , most of them in the 20 to 30 year range . 
  the rents will rise at least proportionally to the income , so waiting it out wo n't help at all . 
  i remember that case - it was not the printing and sale , but sending the printed toilet paper and a letter intended to defame to a number of major mosques and many major news organisations . 
  again , i do not agree with the current law and its application , but in general it is legal to deny any god and other ideas . 
  the law is less strict in germany than the map indicates - the only thing outlawed is defamation of religions and world views ( and this includes humanist ones ) in a way that could disturb public peace . 
  not ideal but we can blaspheme all we want . 
  for east germany - awesome . 
  his policies of glasnost and perestroika meant that we could catch the german communists with their pants down . 
  they had insisted for decades that everything should be more soviet . 
  ` learning from the soviet union means learning to be victorious ! ', 
  and other assorted propaganda bullshit received whole new meaning those days . 
  when east berlin censored the [ sputnik magazine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sputnik_%28magazine%29 ) , it became obvious how isolated they really were . 
  in addition to that gorbachev renounced the breshnev doctrine - the soviet union would no longer use military force to keep its satellite states in check , like it had done so often in the past . 
  as far as i am concerned , he hid it rather well . 
  the excuse that he never fired a shot because he was just a loader is laughable - young g\u00fcnter was assigned to a weapon so destructive that it took several people to operate , what a marvellous achievement of his . 
  being drafted is not the issue - making a career of decades of smug moralising is . 
  grass did not give leeway to those who , unlike him , did not hide their membership in nazi organisations .
