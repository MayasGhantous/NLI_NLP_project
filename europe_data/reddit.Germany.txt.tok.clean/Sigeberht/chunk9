  his crowning achievement is the condemnation of helmut kohl for visiting the bitburg war cemetery with ronald reagan , because among the dead are people like him , members of the waffen-ss . 
  we lost a great hypocrite today . 
  had you chosen the soviet union over the states , you might have signed up for a worse deal than you are imagining . 
  just for comparison , east germany took in a number of communists from chile in 1973 , two years later a quarter were gone , ten years later half of them - most left to be oppressed by capitalists in the west again . 
  in the early 50s , a fresh wave of repression that targeted jews out of the blue , as in [ night of the murdered poets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_of_the_murdered_poets ) and the [ doctors ' plot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doctors%27_plot ) . 
  apart from that the camps were full until after stalin died and khrushchev broke beria 's power base . 
  there were no rehabilitations before that . 
   although your phrasing is awkward and makes it sound like millions died his phrasing is spot on . 
  the gulag system had around 14 million inmates for the duration of its existence . 
  the estimates for deaths range from 1.6 to 10 million for that time . 
  small city in central germany : 1.96 $ per m \u00b3 of clean water and 2.25 $ per m \u00b3 of waste water . 
  these sorts of price mostly come from over sized water wells and treatment plants that have fixed costs to run . 
  the utilities then raised the prices , people started saving water and the prices rose even more . 
  in some places the sewage system has become so dry that the utilities have had to add water to keep the sewers flowing . 
  the whole point of the pastafarians is that everyone is equal before the law . 
  that means every religion is equal before the law as well , not just the favourite one of the politicians and the electorate . 
  no one gets privileges and exceptions . 
  if kansas wants the christian creation myth taught in state schools , they need to teach the other religions as well - if erdogan wants sunni mosques on state universities there need to be ones for other denominations as well . 
  effectively , yes . 
  there are a some states in the us that have [ religious exemptions for faith healing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faith_healing#united_states_law ) in the child abuse and neglect laws up to and including murder and manslaughter charges . 
   parents have ultimate authority over their own children . 
  this might be slightly different in different legal systems , but i was the under the impression that parents are the legal guardians of their children , not their proprietors . 
  as such , the parents ' choices should not be contrary to the child 's well-being and can be limited by law . 
  awesome , now we are at the point where we are no longer asked to give up civil rights for our ` safety ' but for the convenience of officials . 
  good idea , particularly since there is a [ measles epidemic across the border in berlin ] ( http://www.dw.de/berlin-measles-epidemic-reaches-new-high/a-18301149 ) , which we have not been able to control since october . 
  i hope germany introduces mandatory vaccinations soon , there certainly is a majority for it . 
   yep , i just invented that term right now ... you are being to kind to him . 
  the ancient emperor , the wise emperor and the shit emperor . 
  they all ruled in 1888 and are wilhelm i , who founded the reich with bismarck , followed by friedrich iii , a liberal reformer , who unfortunately died of cancer after 99 days , and the muppet who ended it all . 
  agreed , other than this varoufakis has come across as reasonable and his initiative to end the mud slinging reinforces this . 
  asking for help from the german public tends to be significantly more successful when not trying to fleece that public for some fantastic sum of ` war reparations ' at the same time . 
  the common people in germany would have to pay this with their taxes - through this demand the greek government directly associates all of them with the nazis . 
  considering this current and future demand , varoufakis coming up and telling us we should know how bad the nazis were because of our history is not going to go down particularly well . 
  in a twist of genius the arbeitsst\u00e4ttenverordnung ( work place ordinance ) is equally valid for military work places . 
  we are all pleased to know that the gun exhaust gas concentration in the passenger compartment of a firing puma ifv is no longer harmful to pregnant women . 
  the cookies in the ration pack should be hard enough and biodegradable . 
  they have been disliking the g36 since it was introduced , though . 
  it has had the reputation of a flimsy and low powered pea shooter , according to the soldiers i talked to . 
  they never said a bad word about the g3 though , and wanted it back or rather never wanted to let it go . 
  the other complaint is that there are not enough weapons for every soldier - some units were short 41 % on pistols , 31 % on machine guns and 75 % on night vision equipment - completely valid complaints . 
  of course not , our precious supply of broomsticks is reserved for the armoured forces to replace machine cannons with . 
  the infantry can cut a twig from the next tree , that should do . 
  the holy roman emperor 's coat of arms was a black eagle with red tinctures ( beak and claws ) on a golden shield . 
  later pan german , liberation and democratic movements picked up these colours . 
  the meaning of each colour was added during the liberation wars around 1813/15 : ` aus der schw\u00e4rze der knechtschaft durch blutige schlachten ans goldene licht der freiheit . ', 
  ` from the blackness of servitude through bloody battles to the golden light of freedom . ', 
   i would n't support one about nazi germany 's defeat . 
  except there already was a [ 2014 commemorative coin ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/comm/html/comm_2014.en.html ) about the landing in normandy issued by france and one about wwi by belgium . 
  no complaint from france there . 
  apparently the problem is not celebrating wars and battles , it is celebrating one which france lost . 
  considering this sub has grown quite a bit recently more filters would certainly help individuals find stuff they are interested in . 
  searching through dozens of threads with comparative pictures of european cities , vehicles , toilets or what ever can be a bit tedious at times . 
   not so sure about the english terms , ... germany uses a two tier system for the boards of directors that is uncommon in the us and many other countries . 
  the law affects the supervisory boards ( aufsichtsr\u00e4te ) which are voted in by the shareholders . 
  these appoint and control the executive boards ( vorst\u00e4nde ) . 
  so in effect this law interferes with the freedom of the shareholders to vote for who they want to represent their interests . 
  thank goodness this pressing issue has finally been resolved , there can never be enough bureaucracy piled on businesses . 
  great info , i was wondering what the article summed up as motor vehicles . 
  there are around 30 un resolutions on georgia , usually extending the mandate of the peacekeeping forces there , most of which are russian . 
  ( [ example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1808 ) ) . 
  the recent un resolutions on the countries mentioned do not authorize invasion or secession , in contrast to the explicit permission for the [ liberation of kuwait ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_678 ) . 
  neither iraq nor libya harboured terrorist groups significant to the west before the invasions . 
  the western alliance have not exactly been a shining example to the world in the past and that is coming back to bite us in the arse . 
  one of the [ main sources of international law is custom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/customary_international_law ) , how states conduct themselves shapes what is acceptable internationally . 
  it is applied tu quoque and silence is consent . 
  it can be argued , and the russians do , that the secession of kosovo under nato occupation , the invasions in iraq , afghanistan and lybia changed the customs sufficiently to permit their invasions in georgia , crimea , ukraine and so on . 
  the western alliance has to be careful with their actions no to give others excuses that can be used against it . 
  interesting , i 'll have to read up on that . 
  the map shows the loss of population , not the battles though . 
  oldenburg and holstein , both subject to the danish crown at the time hardly suffered any losses , it is fair to assume the same for jutland . 
  well , everyone relied on mercenaries in those days . 
  christian iv certainly got a good peace deal - essentially a return to the status quo . 
  there are some countries in europe that have retarded laws or considered them . 
  in this example from germany [ tools used for security testing ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fnetzpolitik.org%2f2014%2fhackertools-im-it-sicherheitsgesetz%2f&amp;edit-text= ) were effectively outlawed . 
  that was coined at ` it is all swedens fault ' - the danish intervention , though an incompetent failure , meant 4 years of battles in mecklenburg and pomerania , some of the most devastated areas . 
  the swedes actually accomplished something and are well regarded in these areas . 
  most of them died as either direct war casualties , or from pillaging bands of mercenaries , starvation because of devastated farm land or the numerous epidemics at the time . 
  there was a [ danish intervention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war#danish_intervention ) as well , this whole affair was a team effort . 
  zwickau is less than 50 km from the border to bavaria . 
  you are completely correct that they were in reception range . 
  well , just read the descriptions . 
  [ what has the iss ever done for us ? 
  ] ( https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/experiments_by_name.html ) clearly humanity would have benefited by 3 more rocks one of the rovers could have picked up . 
  great example , an image from hubble , deployed by a space shuttle , upgraded and repaired by four more shuttle missions clearly shows the futility of manned space flight . 
  and we do n't have the technology because we did not spend any money to research it - there is no progress to be made in sticking to what we know already . 
  i am not so sure that synthetic aperture observatories cause the greatest support and excitement either . 
  it is easier to gather public support if the space program includes spectacular missions and technology . 
  these missions are not mutually exclusive - why should we spend money on discovering earth likes if we can not even settle the closest celestial object . 
  then we should increase the esa budget , even if we have to sacrifice a bank or two . 
  in the conifer and mixed forests of northern and eastern germany the most common mushrooms are maronen-r\u00f6hrling / imleria badia , steinpilz/boletus edulis and pfifferling/cantharellus cibarius . 
  as the usual harvest time is around autumn and coincides with the hunting season , a favorite is to serve mushrooms with game . 
  examples would be [ boar in cream with mushrooms ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.thueringenforst.de%2fwildgut%2fwildrezepte%2fschwarzwild%2f&amp;edit-text= ) or [ hare ragout with chanterelles ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.thueringenforst.de%2fwildgut%2fwildrezepte%2frezepte-der-foerster%2f&amp;edit-text= ), 
  maybe she can hang in for a few presidencies longer , queen victoria saw 18 us presidents ( by my count from van buren to mckinley ) . 
  that makes 30 of 44 between the two of them . 
  merkel regrets having said something that lowered her approval ratings . 
  [ recent polls show that 71 to 95 percent of people think she is moving to close to erdogan ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.heute.de%2fzdf-politbarometer-merkel-nimmt-zu-viel-ruecksicht-auf-erdogan-deutliche-verluste-fuer-die-union-gruene-und-linke-legen-zu-43204408.html&amp;edit-text= ) , including her own party . 
  this is an attempt at damage control , not the admission of a mistake - both the polls and the her statement came out the same day . 
  the old terms were ague or marsh fever and are mentioned in [ european art all the way up north to england . 
  ] ( http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/1/00-0101_article ), 
  while i approve of these unexpected acquisitions , it might just be a particularly misguided attempt to apply the [ four color theorem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_color_theorem ) to a political map .
