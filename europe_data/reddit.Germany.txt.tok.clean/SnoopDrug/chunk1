the lottery has a high reward for risk seeking people . 
  of course it 's not a fair game , gambling almost never is . 
  it 's about having a potential chance of getting the high payoff . 
  no , i 'd support it if the funding changes in dui prevention would result in a larger marginal change in welfare compared to national security . 
  people are emotional idiots . 
  but it was n't world news ... and it 's not happening more and more . 
   if drunk driving increased at the same rate as islamic terror attacks there would be a massive government crack down on it . 
  no , this is objectively false . 
  the yearly variation is far higher than the * total * number of terrorist deaths , so how would this be possible ? 
  so terrorism kills maybe a few , and these things kill thousands , and you are admitting that they 're `` treated just as big '' ? 
  ca n't you see the issue ? 
  that point has nothing to do with the argument ... 
  so drunk driving should happen and terrorism should n't ? 
  why is that ? 
  why is drunk driving always going to exist ? 
  why should we focus on the issue that is less significant ? 
   when it happens and it hurts your world view so you try to down play it . 
  like i said before , trying to attack me shows that you do n't have a good argument . 
  but honestly , i do n't really care about the actual attacks when they happen , only the resulting shitshow . 
  why is that so hard for you to believe ? 
  how do these events challenge my world view exactly ? 
  terrorism is nothing new . 
  and you 're fooling yourself if you think the death itself is more cruel than slowly dying of cancer or having your bones stab your lung after a car hits you . 
  we are pretty damn good at anti-terrorism . 
  millions want the west to die , yet these attacks are incredibly rare . 
  also , at least the tiger would n't be politicsed . 
  where is the actual counter-argument in your comment ? 
   if your point is you can not understand why terrorism gets more headlines then drunk driving or people who die of cancer you are so far gone from reality not much can be done to help you . 
  attacking me an not my point is weak , come on , let 's stay on topic . 
   there will always be drunk driving/fatal accidents , people dying of disease etc. 
  wait , so you 're saying because these issues are so much more widespread than terrorism , they deserve ** less ** attention ? 
  unlike terrorism , these issue can actually be tackled by public awareness . 
   no one in europe should ever die from terrorism , it is completely unacceptable and deserves all the media attention it gets , little children should not be run over by trucks and killed by terrorists . 
  once again , no argument of substance , stop with the emotional bs . 
  little children also get killed by all the stuff i stated . 
  https://assets.weforum.org/editor/kdr6tocqjixqwjpjabo-yofc56u3rmobpmes4fmtdfw.jpg terrorism is not something that suddenly popped up in the last 10 years . 
  and constantly panicking about it and covering it on tv for weeks on end wo n't change that . 
  * fatal accidents - first aid training should get more attention and be refreshed on a regular basis . 
  * drunk driving , and distracted driving - this kills many more people than terrorism , is just as unexpected , and can be just as gruesome . 
  * disease/cancer - more screening and teaching people how to check the signs would save thousands . 
  * alcohol - there is a severe lack of attention regarding just how dangerous alcohol is . 
  * climate change - this is more indirect but a much more real threat . 
  it seems an odd problem to be focused on when there are actual threats killing thousands ... nobody is saying ignore it , but how about we have a reasonbly sized response instead of the 34/7 media frenzy ? 
  i agree with you . 
  people want to seem compassionate , it 's the `` right '' thing to do . 
  there is no reason to suddenly voice your support for victims and then look away every time it 's not terrorism , it 's simply silly . 
  but people like to speculate , they like to show how much they care , they like to make political points , and they just plain enjoy drama . 
  if you want to show you compassion , or help people , you can stop writing that fb grief post and volunteer locally . 
  if you really care about people and do n't just want to make yourself feel better , then that 's what you do . 
  it gets attention because its novel . 
  it lets people pretend that horrible deaths do n't occur everyday , that as soon as it 's a bomb it 's somehow more tragic than any other preventable death . 
  the same people asking `` when will it stop '' will call for immigration bans , but not for more obesity awareness , or increased cancer screening . 
  we like to be selective about what we care about . 
  i hate this bs appeal to emotion . 
  you can say that about every death . 
  drunk driving deaths , murders , any manslaughter incidents , train tragedies , avalanches ... 
  why ? 
  does it boil everytime some guy murders a few people ? 
  do n't let terrorism influence you ... 
  genocides of europe megathread, 
  `` with his own weapons '', 
  old article , and there 's a 0 % chance ha can form a coalition . 
  because traffic laws are kurwa . 
  it 's a two way street :-p, 
  that source you linked is sound economic analysis , it 's verbose but not concrete at all . 
  also , i ca n't find any secondary sources on the import figure . 
  it 's a bit much to assume that a ~ 1 % gdp contribution rebuilt germany ( assuming $ 2.5 bn spending after inflation vs a gdp of $ 290bn ) . 
  the significance of imports post ww2 is not comparable to today , they mainly came through tied aid and the like . 
  how dare you ... 
  where are your sources ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/currywurst german https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kadir_nurman german haxe is a thing , try it and you will love it . 
  france is good at cheese , but most bakeries have a smaller selection than german ones , and bakeries are not as common . 
  and did you really say czechs can outsausage us ? 
  do n't you dare !!!, 
  * currywurst * d\u00d6ner kebab ( berlin invention !!! ), 
  * haxe ( the most delicious thing on earth ) * the best goddamn bread on earth * sausage and cured meats ** i am triggered . 
  dear telegraph , is it that hard to actually include the image of what the article is about ? 
  some journalists have no guts , not showing something ugly does n't make it disappear ... https://twitter.com/rglucks1/status/840236937382395905/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw for anyone curious , here it is , pretty damn bad for a mainstream politician . 
  please , someone cross-post this to / r/shitamericanssay . 
  a newspaper having a nationalist motto does n't reek of neutrality or independence . 
  [ you joke , but ... ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/erdogan-turkish-president-israel-hitler-more-barbarous-gaza-interview-palestinians-decide-holocaust-a7431311.html ), 
  someone make an isis style beheading video , but with a bunch of oranges in a blender . 
  reap the karma . 
  and nato keeps him in check , if he starts invading neighbours the treaty falls apart . 
  political means and goals are entirely different things . 
  of course you need some consensus , but that 's not the main purpose , the member states share little values , but common enemies . 
  obviously you ca n't say it 's a pure military alliance , that 'd be political suicide . 
  it 's because the elections are on wednesday . 
  you should thank us germans for that , without hitler we would n't have a european union today and the marshall plan would 've never existed !, 
  / s ^ ^ ^ ^ s, 
  the us is showing the direction and eu countries drive the mill together using the same structure . 
  5/7 for symbolism . 
  americans love overstating the marshall plan 's impact though . 
  it did some great stuff , but many people like the $ 12b ( $ 120b today ) rebuilt europe ... [ interesting read .

  dutch police are some of the most restrained police on this planet . 
  there is a fucking video of how professionally they acted , it was n't excessive for this kind of protest . 
  you ca n't have violent protesters shouting islamic chants blocking the city centre outside a consulate at 2am without registering the process after a turkish official locked herself in an armoured car with bodyguards refusing to follow national orders after purposefully deceiving the government and trying to cause civil unrest . 
  jesus fucking christ that sentence is ridiculous . 
  nope , that 's a time she showed compassion and then strength , she set out her ideals and did n't back down .
