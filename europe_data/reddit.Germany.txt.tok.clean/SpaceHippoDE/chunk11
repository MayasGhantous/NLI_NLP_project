  it 's the price of tasting power . 
  you will never want to let go of it . 
  the us are now caught in an infinite loop of interventions , if they stop , the whole thing will blow up in their face , if they continue ... well , it might blow up as well , but there is a chance they can influence things in a way that benefits them . 
  europe is already able to defend itself against any enemy . 
  with sch\u00e4uble hard on his heels . 
  til . 
   greatthousand i love it . 
  the americans do the same ( at least it 's suspected ) , many systems purchased by nato members are essentially a ` black box ' . 
  keep in mind that most of the german and british deployments are outside of un missions . 
  * unlimited powah !, 
  every day could be a d-day . 
  ah , our former minister of foreign affairs , guido `` es ist deutschland hier '' westerwelle ( rip ) , comes to mind : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laujzgmuei4 . 
  some people agreed that a press conference in germany should be held in german , others made fun of him . 
  my opinion : you ca n't expect someone to speak english when it 's not their native language , especially not when simple mistakes could lead to catastrophic misunderstandings . 
  sassy germans ? 
  in the end , nato is just some words on paper . 
  look at greece and turkey . 
  why would anyone need to quit nato ? 
  sure . 
  you would probably lose the us as your ally though . 
  ca n't tell if that 's an argument for or against it . 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  progressive = western . 
  so , why should n't we allow polygamy ? 
  any reasonable arguments ? 
  i ca n't think of any . 
  they 're conveniently placed far away from us , we 're good . 
  11 degrees and * heavy * rain . 
  summer came early . 
  seems pretty intact as far as i can tell . 
  lol, 
  and i have n't seen proper snow in ages now . 
  january was cold as fuck here , like 3 weeks of < 0 \u00b0 c. 
  but for some fucking reason , it only ever gets cold enough for snow when the weather is good and not a single cloud in sight . 
  i found [ this ] ( http://www.iiss.org/-/media//images/publications/the%20military%20balance/milbal2016/mb%202016%20western%20europe%20the%20dramatic%20decline%20in%20combat%20battalion%20numbers%2019902015.jpg?la=en ) . 
  i compared the numbers for germany with some wikipedia articles . 
  it seems ~ 40 infantry batallions are missing in the chart , might be similar with the other countries . 
  leave nato , leave eu , spend 2,8 % again , watch our neighbors complain . 
  8 = 8/1 -  8 male suicides per 1 female suicide, 
   shifting the narrative into `` white vs black '' and `` i have no idea what came over them '' but we do n't do that at all ... ? 
  lmao, 
  not from my point of view . 
  i can see that massive fedora through the internet . 
  barbarically good . 
  yes !, 
  in a better one . 
  where pommes grow on trees . 
  can you guarantee that ? 
  i 'm going to catch even more downvotes with this , but oh well ... soldiers are usually allowed to return home for a few days every now and then . 
  that 's enough to make babies . 
  let me close by saying that i fully agree that conscription * should * be for everyone . 
  but that 's just not how it works . 
  that 's not how war works . 
  you do n't seem to understand : if everyone is drafted , there will be no one left to take care of the things i mentioned above . 
  and i 'm not convinced that those unfit for service could take care of all that . 
  austria is probably a bad example , because in cas eof war you would be in a shitty position indeed . 
  but what is a larger country like france , poland , germany , . . going to do ? 
  draft men and women only to realize that a ) they ca n't support such a large fighting force , or b ) to realize they ca n't send every citizen to the frontlines because they need some people to the things mentioned above ? 
  a giant upvote ? 
  the problem is that in times of war , someone needs to keep the economy running , produce weapons , ammunition , have children , ... 
  sounds like one of those * socially-awkward-exchange-student-fucked-up-because-of-cultural-misunderstanding * - stories . 
  `` swine peesteul ! '', 
  you have the entire continent against you . 
  so do i when i rip a silent but deadly one in public . 
  `` sorry , no doutch , only english . 
  but do try our gluten-free avocado fries . '', 
  just go to / r/mapporn and search for maps related to germany . 
  so impress, 
  yeah , they 've been catching up lately . 
  the flag is almost right . 
  i used to think palatschinken was some kind of fancy ham ... austrian = balkan german . 
  good old gronkh . 
  lack of light , i assume . 
  that makes sense . 
  in europe at least , we were a proper shit continent back then . 
  sobrino, 
  i fully expected it to be a german town with that name . 
  you could probably just relocate it to some empty place in north germany and no one would notice . 
  those little tree lines also prevent the soil from beig blown away by the wind . 
  yass, 
  well , it was meant as a joke and satire over at / r/de at first . 
  i can see the place where i was born :3, 
  the question is `` who would you want to have on your side ? '', 
  not `` who is your favorite country ? '' . 
  it 's not a surprise that many people want to be on the same side as the extremely muscular and violent guy . 
  and the countries that did n't name the us mostly seem to be countries that have good reasons to strongly dislike the us , which could be the reason they would n't choose the muscular guy . 
  it 's the roman heritage . 
  probably just romanian . 
  [ duck and cover ], 
  `` shiiieeet , missed my deployment ! '', 
  i never understood why austria chose the ef anyway . 
  they only use it for peace time air policing , it would be almost useless for actual air combat since it lacks medium - / long-range air-to-air missiles . 
  they also did n't choose to equip it with bombs or air-to-ground missiles or a reconnaissance system . 
  essentially , the austrian efs are overpriced flying police cars . 
  they probably could have purchased a number of dirt cheap sub-sonic fighter aircraft for both the air policing and ground attack role , and the rest of the money could have easily bought them a solid surface-based air defence system . 
  that would leave the austrian air force with a sufficient ability to shoot down hijacked airliners , pound the ground and defend their territory against an actual attack . 
   kuchenschrank that would be my favorite kind of cabinet , since it has cake :3, 
  i suddenly feel the urge to play some aoe 2 . 
  next up : `` the most polish of german death camps '', 
  they did .
