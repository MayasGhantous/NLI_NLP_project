  it 's sad but you 're right . 
  if things continue like this , we should really question if we can still trust the us .

  you 're talking bullshit .

  i can feel the mosquito bites by just looking at this picture . 
  to be precise : it 's the german law that stops germany from going nuclear . 
  why would they deploy one of the most valuable tanks to a place that becomes a death trap in case of war ? 
  what can i say , we like the extremes .

  serbia was kinda forced into that treaty though . 
  same . 
   we could n't even properly intervene in the yugoslavic wars right on our doorstep , or more recently in libya , without uncle sam holding our hand . 
  that supports my point . 
  nato is definitely able to cooperate on a multinational level to achieve its goals . 
  nato has centralised structures and has demonstrated its ability to cooperate on a multinational level on quite a few occasions . 
  a unified european military * ca n't exist * without a unified european superstate with a european government . 
  as long as the member states are still sovereign , a european military would actually be a european nato , nothing more and nothing less . 
  putin will still be elected for another term though . 
  because the member states are still more or less sovereign states with different policies in many areas . 
  you can almost taste the sour wine . 
  umm ... ? 
  those large ass submarines could n't even submerge in the baltic sea . 
  oh no , they deployed a whole brigade !, 
  they will literally steamroll our tiny army !, 
  do n't mind me , just waiting for this thread to derail . 
  he looks like a jacked phil collins/steve jobs now . 
  the eu kinda does that already ( battlegroups , eurocorps ) , but it 's important to note that this is not the same as a european army . 
  that would only be possible in a european superstate . 
  nato is n't a military . 
  the eu ca n't have a military because there is no institution that could command such a military . 
  no government/sovereignty -  no military . 
  i would n't be surprised if many of the betters were the kind of people who tend to vote for such parties . 
  melania and me loooove mushrooms !, 
  the worst thing is that the hotel next to the lake has now lost a perfectly good lounger because the german tourist still has n't returned to remove his towel .

  seems unbalanced , needs a little growth in the west . 
  the christmas market that i visited 2 weeks ago already had concrete blocks to prevent a nice-style attack . 
  it demonstrates unity and confidence , something that only a healthy and strong civil society could do . 
  now guess what civil societies look like in countries that are rocked by terrorism or even war ( think iraq , syria ) ? 
  and * that * would help in defeating the islamists ?

  nazi apologist ... you can suck my fucking dick . 
  you can be tried for murder if you kill soldiers as a non-combatant . 
  i do n't know if national law might override that in a way as many constitutions allow citizens to fight back when democracy and liberty are in danger . 
  wartime also means that only soldiers are allowed to fight , that 's the problem here . 
  that 's a very baltic-looking forest . 
  uh ... i got ta go , got some j ^ e ^ w some bread in the oven . 
  it gets even better , back then we were facing the fucking warsaw pact , the largest army this world has ever seen ( so far ) . 
  now it 's just russia . 
  spotted the hillbilly, 
  everyone from outside of germany does that for some reason . 
  remember people , she 's still the leader of the liberal-conservative party . 
  and the liberal part only refers to free markets , not social liberalism . 
  yes , and that 's the only reason we do n't have same-sex marriage yet . 
  merkel says she is n't comfortable with it . 
  that 's exactly what i meant .
