  super communists . 
  taking the piss is a german thing , sorry . 
  trick is ~ ~ not ~ ~ to drink so much that you have ~ ~ a ~ ~ no problem . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, 
  tomorrow never dies . 
  orban ? 
  1:34 robbie williams reference ? 
  it 's like the * sixth sense * , but with obese people instead of dead ones . 
  would watch . 
  itt : portugal wins but no one wants to admit that . 
  dublin ' the rent . 
  that 's sounds like the most dutch explanation . 
  i , uh ... what ? 
  are you sure the 1915 picture is not a post-ww2 picture ? 
  looks like the border moved to the dutch side a little bit in the last pic ... anschl\u00fcsschen ? 
  pls no lick thanks, 
  looks like we expanded , boys and girls !, 
  jews in germany mostly were no immigrants , of course they did . 
  well , northern germany has a mountain that is 1000 + m. 
  the powerbank will go up in smoke , i guarantee it . 
  `` now laugh '', 
  seems kinda flat , tbh . 
  ^ ^ ^ got ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ name ^ ^ ^ though ? 
  looks a bit like the balkans . 
   huge orgasm back when the subway was n't such a smooth ride , most women would orgasm after x minutes at this exact station . 
   to make the post-modern life bearable for at least a couple of hours 2close2home, 
  so ~ ~ show me . ~ ~ censor them . 
  we do n't even have 3 divisons . 
  why did the eu expand ? 
  why is ( almost ) everyone so excited about cooperation or even integration ? 
  because it 's supposed to promote peace and stability . 
  the only reason why the major european states have n't fucked each other up in a few decades is the fact that they are all part of the same alliances . 
  that would be the worst idea ever , the baltics are a trap . 
  do we think that ? 
  kanalratte ( sewer rat ) is a german swear word . 
  i think he 's fine with it though . 
  now you only need a new fighter jet to replace the hornets in a few years . 
   not of this world po-polan can finally into ... * space * ?? 
  to prevent any misunderstandings : multiculturalism is not the same as immigration . 
  multiculturalism is just one way of handling immigration ( not the best one , imo ) . 
  it 's still something that does n't happen every day , i 'm also curious what the backstory is . 
  our whole country is an intervalo nuboso . 
  does n't it make much more sense to measure the contributions in actual capabilities ? 
  luxemburg could be a dope ass superpower with their tiny percentage if they spent it more efficiently than everyone else . 
  this graph does n't really tell us anything . 
  judging by the picture , i thought it crashed into the carrier . 
  just wait . 
  / r/gopnikengineering, 
  [ crappy pic of the place with snow . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fr7zhrk.jpg ) i slipped on those stairs at least 10 times on my way up . 
  lmao, 
  the border probably broke . 
  georgia and germany have been removed ? 
  if you ask me in this context - yes . 
  if you randomly asked me to think of an asian person , i would imagine someone with dark hair and squinty eyes . 
  uhm ... i 'm very confident that most people will think of china , japan , etc. 
  when they hear * asia * . 
  not the middle east . 
   dont act like this isnt possible . 
  why ? 
  i honestly do n't think most people are educated enough to realise asia is that big . 
  portugal is so far in the west , they are east . 
   europe who decides the eu ca n't decide shit . 
  there literally ** ca n't ** be a eu military , we need a european superstate first . 
  no need to get salty , there is no one right way to divide europe into regions . 
  it really all comes down to perception and whether you go by geography , culture , language , history or politics . 
  sort of , we 're still living in the aftermath of cold war . 
  [ my take . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zlowgwl.png ) based on both geography and recent history . 
  heck me in the pooper , this is cool, 
  quitaly 3 . 
  `` my flexible friend . '', 
  that was no joke . 
  or permanently eye closing . 
  if you think the presence of foreign troops counts as occupation , we are still occupied . 
  but 1991 was the year germany regained its full sovereignty . 
  op is literally a bear living in siberia . 
   a commitment by each country to come to the mutual defense of an attacked country . 
  i 'm talking about national defence policies here . 
  those typically consist of far more than just article 5 . 
  also , that 's still not specific enough . 
   when georgia can commit more troops to an article 5 war despite not being in nato than almost every nato member um ... that 's not going to happen ... 
   germans , stop lying about your history i 'm so close to snapping . 
  shit clay, 
  defency policy 101 : - step 1 : what 's the goal of our defence policy ? 
  - step 2 : what does that mean for our military ? 
  ( size , structure , equipment , training , ... ) - step 3 : set up the defence budget . 
  most nato members : * `` alright , we 're starting with step 3 guys !!, 
  '' * does this bother anyone else ? 
  i do n't walk into a supermarket and just hand the employee a 50 $ bill and tell them to fill my shopping cart with whatever they want . 
  that 's how you starve to death with a full fridge . 
  username defnitely checks out . 
  so manly . 
  wow . 
  wow sweden is so backwards , are they even trying ??? 
  too real, 
  whataboutism ^ ^ 2, 
  not an excuse not to take migrants, 
  metal does n't float usually .
