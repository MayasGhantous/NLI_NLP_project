  i never claimed anyone likes us when we 're stable . 
  [ eeee . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/2jvvz8n_hz0?t=6 ), 
  you would n't like us when we 're instable . 
  and it 's amazing . 
  they 've done that before ( afghanistan ) . 
  not a direct democracy . 
  polls do n't matter in this case because the people do n't get to decide . 
  our current enemies do n't have tanks and aircraft either . 
  because our current enemies do n't really have cannons . 
  and what would that source be ... ? 
  i saw people negotiating a price in a. . . * video * . 
   petropavlovsk-kamchatsky still better than berlin . 
   benefits snowless winters make me suicidal . 
  no $ uromonies , do n't ask how i found out . 
  the only thing they did n't have were aircraft carriers , nukes and cruise missiles . 
  and i 'm not sure if that was due to legal restrictions . 
  those would have been lifted after 1991 anyway . 
  well , as of 1990 the west german military had ( in case of mobilization ) a strength of ~ 1.3 million soliders . 
  that 's how restricted they were . 
  is n't this just a fake office for representation ? 
  you do n't even need colonies . 
  is it just me or is this a penis thing ? 
  [ reminds me of bernie .

  what the other guy said + many east germans had favorable experiences with the red army , same as with the us/uk/fr / cn forces in west germany . 
  bottom klek *, 
  seems inconvenient , but i guess it [ could be worse .

  also : we have east germany dragging us down , at least that 's what i suspect . 
  clever girl . 
  it 's not new . 
  just some peace-time cooperation that could come in handy if both militaries ever happen to fight on the same side of the same war . 
  you do understand that czech troops remain under czech control at all times ? 
  in fact , this cooperation even enhances your defence capability . 
  what exactly is high treason here ? 
  most of them ca n't even walk . 
  it does indeed * begrenz * austria . 
   that day, 
   faries that live in the forest . 
  they do n't even have forests . 
  just some trees . 
  same , there was a guy called guy de josselin iirc . 
  and the menu screen of course . 
  shame , that was my favorite from my random pics folder . 
  well , * soziale marktwirtschaft * is also a cdu-thing and that 's not a typical position for a true conservative party . 
  christian democrats . 
  they are mostly conservative in social questions ( no gay marriage , mothers stay at home etc. 
  some of you guys are alright , do n't come to the kanzerlamt tomorrow . 
  w e w m e c e w m e c, 
  just like most parts of europe . 
  that handwriting though . 
  made me think of [ this ] ( http://img.time2draw.com/2016/02/how-to-draw-squid-sea-animal-final-step-215x382.png ) , also [ this ] ( http://web.ipmsusa3.org/sites/default/files/reviews/mig-21-smmmf-fishbed-j-pitot-tube/mig21nose.jpg ) . 
  ^ ^ so ^ ^ many ^ ^ violations ^ ^ of ^ ^ polandball ^ ^ rules ... 
  i kinda miss those vomit-colored shirts : /, 
   straight up hates [ citation very much needed ] the majority supports an increase in defence spending . 
   out of 178.233 active soldiers not if it 's the * army * . 
  that would be ~ 60.000 soldiers . 
   rebirth with some birth defects . 
  why not , i 'm getting tired of splitting poland anyway . 
  it is , in summer at least . 
  also , finde me a piece of technology that does n't perform worse under harsh conditions . 
  friday and saturday are the same day , i call it blurday . 
  you must be the internet explorer of redditors .

  does no one here read my comments ? 
  that 's also what i want , but this weird guy up there wanted germany to do all of the work alone . 
  i do n't , but why should germany do all of the work alone that nato as a whole is supposed to do ? 
  i just do n't understand you . 
  we were n't even talking about whether germany would stand by their allies or not ( we would , as we have demonstrated in the past ) . 
   of course not , nato still stands . 
  uh ... why ? 
  germany does n't even share a border with russia . 
  if nato still stands , that would be an incredible waste of money . 
   german state must be capable of defending itself from any potential threat coming from russia . 
  so we 're supposed to do it alone now ? 
  what about nato ?

  well , german universities are not quite free , they just do n't call it a fee . 
  looks like a north german sphinx . 
  that sounds infinitely shittier . 
  yeah , probably . 
  that 's the median . 
  patriot is whatever you fire from it . 
  it can be used against aircraft , which is its primary purpose in most militaries . 
  the north is the east of the west . 
  central germany . 
  looks just like in my part of germany . 
  turkey is make the shooty shooty bang self kill, 
  anschluss through the backdoor . 
  not much will change for us . 
  maybe a certain island nation will feel the need to tag along , but that 's about it . 
  korea is far away , there is more important things for us to worry about . 
  no need to rub it in ... oh wait , that 's the name of the place ? 
  you could always land a job with hermes as a parcel deliveryperson . 
  just ring the door bell , wait 10 seconds and run away . 
  the english term : snoop dogg and all that . 
  translated into german : sheep shit and a sea with a half-time position . 
  germany itself is rather safe .
