  i was born close to the baltic coast and have lived there for 19 years , do i qualify ?

  that 's incredibly rude . 
  calls for a negative tip . 
  maybe . 
  maybe not . 
  really depends on the conetxt . 
  you 're a schluchtenschei\u00dfer yourself then . 
  not tipping your waiter usually means that a ) , you were n't satisified with the service ( not the food ) or b ) , you 're broke . 
  [ germany ], 
  translations for those who still have n't accepted their old/new \u00dcberlords :  `` holla die waldfee '' * holla * the forest fairy . 
  oh the relief . 
  probably also because the nearest country * was * pretty wealthy . 
  as one word ? 
  is that the opposite of the * idiotenleerzeichen * ( putting a space in between compound words when they should be one word ) ? 
  i have a radar for russians , it 's a combination of facial features/expressions and clothing . 
  canadians and usians are also very easy to spot , mostly because of their fashion choices ( shirts with collars , non-h & m hoodies , cargo shorts , basecaps , sport sunglasses , ... ) . 
  germany . 
  very strong , and it 's becoming stronger with all the wars and chaos happening around us . 
  the eu must not fail . 
  a false flag ? 
  a-stan was a mistake . 
  i 'd rather not die . 
  kill for it ? 
  yes . 
  back in my day , * pimmeln * meant cockslapping your classmates . 
  well , it was n't the right thing as his welfare policies were aimed at maintaining the class divide that gave people like him so much power . 
  well , artists need to make a living somehow . 
  alright , coordination and sharing of information happens on a multinational level , but only the czech mod could order czech fighter jets to shoot down an aircraft in czech airspace . 
   it is not a decision of czech army but nato command centre i 'm fairly sure that 's not correct . 
  what happens in cz is none of natos business , it 's a national affair . 
  latvia * is * blasphemy ? 
  oook !, 
  i understood that from the beginning . 
  and about the arrogance - i can say the same about austrians . 
  note my use of quotation marks . 
  call it `` universal german german '' then . 
  that 's why i specified this is only true in germany . 
  spanish neighbor in spain thought me and my family were french because my sister does n't know any spanish and tried to communicate in french . 
  i just rolled with it . 
  in paris everyone seemed to think i was french , too . 
  i guess i just do n't display the typical teutonic habits and my french is * premi\u00e8re cr\u00e8me * . 
  we do n't even cover the war that much , it 's more about what happened before and after . 
   northern accent you do n't even know what a nothern accent is if you think they teach it around the world . 
  `` proper accent '' in germany means that you could n't really tell what part of germany a person is from . 
  that 's definitely true for me and a most people i know . 
  shoes in the fourth link would go well with white socks , khaki cargo-zip-off-leg shorts and a sunburn . 
  do n't think that europe is some kind of uv-less place , i 've seen ( medium ) black people get sunburnt in germany . 
  so yes , you can get quite a tan by accident , the degree obviously depends on your skin type . 
  \\  implying that austrians would ever decline a good anschluss, 
  culture is constantly changing , you ca n't preserve it anyway . 
  in fact , our modern day culture is a result of thousands of years of migration , war , ethnic cleansing , etc. , etc. 
  and it is n't half bad . 
  you 're not stingy unless you 've tried to fit the contents of your shopping cart into 3 vegetable bags before .

  nothing will change . 
  nothing . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  trust us . 
  especially the austrian-german border will remain totally untouched . 
  we also have * otto normalverbraucher * ( otto normal consumer ) . 
  they are usually shot , i think . 
  i mostly trust them but i also feel like there is n't much you can do if they treat you badly . 
  he was probably thinking of * doucheland * , * dootchland * etc.

  kill - france fuck - france marry - france it 's complicated . 
  where the fuck do you live ? 
  blockwartshausen ? 
  i think married women often wore headscarves to show they were taken . 
   the germans : they had massive state of the art tents can not confirm . 
  my parents went camping with my sister and me quite a few times when we were young ( late 90s/early 00s ) . 
  first time was a trip from north germany ( where we lived ) to andorra to visit relatives . 
  it was a very hot summer , our old opel did n't have ac , neither did the tents . 
  it was amazing . 
  first time i saw actual mountains ( massif central , pyrenees ) . 
  i remember that we were stuck in a traffic jam somewhere high up in the pyrenees and i was afraid that we would suffocate if we rolled the car windows down ( thin air and all that ) . 
  i 'm thinking about taking that trip again with some friends once we have graduated . 
  we also went north , from germany through denmark and sweden to southern norway . 
  good thing that most camping sites in scandinavia have those little huts you can rent for a night or two . 
  norwegian summer nights ai n't no joke . 
  but somehow it was still really hot and humid when we decided to hike up to a wonderful glacier . 
  that 's ... soemthing completely different in my book . 
   your country #  eu army does no one understand this ? 
  as long as we have sovereign states ** there ca n't be a european military ** . 
  a military requires a person/institution who is in command , the eu does n't have a government/head of state who could fill that role . 
  if it had a government , it would n't be the eu anymore , it would become a single nation while the member states would cease to exist as sovereign entities . 
  i propose you rephrase your question :  would you want a unified european superstate to spend 2 % of its gdp on the military ? 
  or :  would you like the member states of the eu to agree to spend 2 % of their gdp on their national militaries ?
