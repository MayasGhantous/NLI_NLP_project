  not really , in most cases people only fly the imperial flag because flying that * other * flag is illegal . 
  i do n't . 
  but that does n't mean i do n't see a potential enemy in them . 
  the cumulated effects of high altitudes , french and schoggi . 
  we would all merge in the end . 
  it was just an example . 
  ve vill make it w\u00f6rk . 
  yes , but it has to be a bottom-up approach . 
  member states should unify ( e.g. 
  lithuania + latvia , netherlands + germany ) so that the number of eu members is constantly reduced until there is only one state left . 
  quite a bit , it 's mostly the passive-aggressive , subtle kind of patriotism . 
  ask a german about patriotism and they will deny that such a thing even exists here . 
  tell them that you dislike a certain aspect of germany ... oh boy . 
  we get it , the usa are amazing . 
  fewer people -  smaller stadiums . 
  it had a major impact on germany , so yes . 
  probably 9/11 . 
  sheeple do . 
  show me the lynx that killed a person . 
  well shit . 
  because when we kiss in germany ( we rarely do ) , it 's usually an actual little kiss . 
   noises tak and slurp seem a little strange , but those noises seem pretty normal to me . 
  you got ta help me out there , do you actually touch the other persons cheek with your lips ? 
  when i was in france as an exchange student years ago i just thought `` eh fuck it '' and went all in , but recently i 've heard that the lips are n't supposed to actually touch the cheek ... 
  we also had bagged milk in germany when i was a kid . 
  it vanished around 2000 for some reason . 
  [ these . 
  yes . 
  do n't worry , it will backfire completely . 
  i cal everyone by their name , except for my parents and grandparents . 
   trump nuked the white house #  just ca n't happen not too sure . 
  still got your wallet ? 
  if only i fucking knew . 
  [ tamikrest - aratan n tinariwen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eetjwcrph-w ) ( touareg/tamacheq ), 
  a little rare but normal . 
  middle eastern : crying babies . 
  woman ( wife ) shouting . 
  always . 
  german : the guy who desperately tries to make the team stick to da plan . 
  has no fun . 
  american : also has a plan , speaks louder than the german , 90 % of them are iraq/a-stan vets . 
  french : talks about something else in french . 
  british : has fun but does n't sound like it . 
  for me it 's anything from 15 \u00b0 c in winter ( at night ) to 27 \u00b0 c in summer . 
   weird you forgot the most important bit . 
  i 'm light blonde and i stick out in crowds . 
  blue eyes are probably far more common . 
  yes , my ancestors were free farmers , pretty wealthy and all that . 
  sort of like noblemen , except they were n't . 
  wallah , yes , they did . 
  austrians also come across as smug assholes from time to time . 
  the good thing about the climate in germany is that it 's not really cold , neither is it really hot . 
  temperatures ranging from -10 \u00b0 c ( cold winter night ) to +35 \u00b0 c ( hot summer day ) are normal here , so 40 \u00b0 c in spain or -20 \u00b0 c in norway do n't feel too unusual to me . 
  it 's things like strong winds , extreme humidity , lots of rain/snow etc. 
  that are much harder to get used to in my experience . 
   we were told . 
  i 'm afraid your teacher just had a problem with french and german people . 
  do the canary islands count ? 
  [ [ eurobeat intensifies ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-2iyswfdc ), 
  those edgy austrians . 
  why though ? 
  mandatory for everyone . 
  past generations usually forgot most of what they had learned , but since we have the internet now , there is an actual use for english , people are increasingly more fluent . 
  but in the end it still depends on your personal success in school . 
  americans sound like `` rrararwaaarwrlikerarararawwwlikewrraaauknowrrarww '' . 
   talk ? 
  lol no , lawsuit . 
  you really are central europeans . 
  at this point they must have killed millions of civilians all over the world . 
  and what exactly was achieved ? 
  ^ ^ ^ deutsch *, 
   exist for those times when there 's no other word see , i never understood how people got the idea that german somehow has more words for more things than other languages . 
  the entire point of languages is to have words for * all * the things , or just invent new words if you do n't have an appropriate word . 
  the only difference is that we do n't put spaces in our compound words . 
  that 's it . 
  german is n't special . 
  buzzfeed and huff post can stop writing articles about it . 
  the stupidest of these articles i 've ever ~ ~ read ~ ~ closed after one paragraph had a list of german words * that are totally unique , no other language has them !, 
  * and what was right next to these german words ? 
  the english translation . 
  * wow !, 
  so german !, 
  so unique !, 
  so intranslatable !, 
  * well , it literally ( and i mean * literally * ) means `` coping with the past '' . 
  impressive . 
  so amazing . 
  or take a look at [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/atzns5l.jpg ) tweet , the internet really went nuts over it a while ago . 
  yet the * exact effin english equivalent of this word * is right there in the screenshot !, 
  what 's next ? 
  americans creaming their pants over the fact that there is a german word for tree ? 
  i hope that cleared it up . 
  we have flatrate brothels , if that is what you meant . 
  it 's just that today north germans are more likely to speak standard german than anyone else . 
  [ it 's why the brits are leaving us , i 'm 100 % sure .
