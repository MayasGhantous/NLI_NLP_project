  even if someone is fluent in english , it will always be a bit of a hassle to switch languages . 
   what is your experience in other countries where you did n't speak the local language ? 
  france : only know some very basic french , used to be almost fluent though . 
  went to paris last year , most young people know decent english and are willing to use it . 
  spain : english wo n't get you far . 
  even if someone knows english , it 's often really hard to understand . 
  i did n't even notice that the pilot did his little welcome speech in both spanish * and * english , sounded like spanish and more spanish . 
  on the plus side , spanish is easy to read once you know a few very basic basics , so you wo n't get lost that easily . 
  norway : ez pz . 
  tap water . 
  so cheap . 
  i do n't think you really want that . 
  yes , the dog won . 
  china , not the world . 
  how could a single country defeat the rest of the world ? 
  the war was lost for germany as soon as the nazis decided to fuck with more than just one or two countries at a time . 
  real stores are far larger than aldi etc. 
  but they sell all kinds of things , not only food . 
   secular  restricting religious practice not even the french do that . 
  school lessons are more than enough to become fluent , if you 're on a gymnasium , that is . 
  and then there is the internet , that 's where you become * really * fluent . 
   special relationship with italia alright alright alright, 
  meh , it all looks the same there , no trees or hills to break up the monotony . 
  baltic area is more beautiful imo . 
  and you make fun of us prussians for being stiff ... 
  not really , austrians do this , but it 's not very big in germany . 
  just the last name . 
  who the f addresses the professor with their title in germany ? 
  very developed but still mostly produces pseudo-deep shit . 
   hamburger you might want to go with * hamburg resident * . 
  something something griezmann is obviously a german name, 
  note the flies smelling carcass . 
  45 min periods with alternating 5 and 15 min breaks ( my school switched to double-periods at some point , which also meant the breaks were twice as long ) . 
  starting at 7:45 h. 
  in elementary ( grade 1-4 ) , we were usually home by 11-12h , by the time i graduated ( grade 13 ) it was usually between 13h and 16h . 
  also , we sometimes had 45min of nothing in our schedule due to planning ( only for older students , ca n't leave little kids alone ) or started one , two or even three periods later than 7:45 h. 
  lmao you have no idea how much media fooled you, 
  the place is full of `` sorry , no german , but do try our ethnic salad steaks '' kind of restaurants . 
  i would also be cool with germany joining the netherlands as a ski ressort tbh . 
  i learned how to grow mold in my lunchbox . 
  and love-hate-realtionship in this case means that germans love austria and austrians hate germany . 
  too many words . 
  do you want my phone bill to explode ? 
  `` wallah was los '', 
  my last name on the landline , just `` hallo '' or `` ja '' on mobile . 
  we are not aware of that , but you already answered the question : it seems we do . 
  my advice : deal with it . 
  culture n shit . 
  i did n't know dirt roads could be so smooth until i visited sweden and norway . 
  if there is hope : wait for them to draft me . 
  if there is no hope : get my ass on a fucking ship to the us/canada . 
  and italy . 
  turkish d\u00f6ner shops and supermarkets . 
  / r/de is technically a. . . * germosphere * subreddit , but in reality it 's 99 % germany-related . 
  pretty chill . 
  balanced content , not too many * maimais * , not a boring serious-stuff-only sub either . 
  dat romantic nationalism, 
  i 'm shocked . 
  north, 
  y' all need some prussia . 
  i do n't know what you mean by `` these parts '' but i ca n't remember seeing a single school without flags . 
  federal flag , state flag and maybe the local coat of arms and the eu flag . 
  funny you should mention that , because i did . 
  did n't cover all of the grammar though . 
  syntax and irregular verbs . 
  and why would you need that fucking * subjonctif * ? 
  i 've had 7 years of french in school and 9 years of english , but my english is at least 10 times better than my french . 
  i 'm not from western europe but i 've also never heard of him before . 
  looks like ben stiller . 
  as a north german , the main similarities are the language ( more or less ) , political system ( to a certain degree ) , and ... and ... uh i think that 's it . 
  i really do n't know why austria would be closer to germany than the netherlands or denmark . 
  southerners will mention more similarities , but for me , that 's pretty much all . 
  damn right . 
  you are a little more likely to hear it from the inside of a black bmw . 
  all of germany has been caught in a federal cringe for weeks now . 
  a few years ago . 
  the late 2000s/early 2010s were by far the best era germany has ever had . 
  some fellow germans here suggested it was 1871-1914 , but the fact that everyone happily went to war at the end of that period shows that this is obviously not true .

  100 % accurate . 
  i always though you were in the eurozone until ... uh well ... i saw a video of a man and a woman ... negotiating a price . 
  culture shock .

  ## tremendously . 
  [ exactly .

   in my experience germans find that very weird . 
  yes . 
  and how does this importance transfer to everyday life ? 
  will a doktor be pissed if you do n't call him by his title ? 
  could someone elaborate on why titles are important in austria ? 
  hamburg is n't that close to the sea , just has a dirty river :p,
