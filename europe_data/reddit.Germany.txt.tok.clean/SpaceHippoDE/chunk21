  no , but i wo n't let the system get me down . 
  with my feet . 
  * oook * . 
  cozy in a dustpan . 
  i do n't think anyone really cares about people who are probably 100 % decayed by now . 
  would be kinda boring in my case . 
  i think i 'm the the first one in the recorded history of our family to live more than 300km from their birthplace . 
  i did n't know it was the same thing until a few years ago . 
  we do n't call it inch though , its zoll . 
  the internet . 
  yes . 
  very different from the larger hanseatic cities on the coast . 
  but not the typical northern hanseatic style . 
  looks like central or southern germany . 
  probably a little less than 2 . 
  that picture does not represent north germany at all . 
  more or less . 
  during cold war , the west german military had a peace time strength of ~ 500.000 troops and a war time strength of ~ 1,3 million . 
  inactive reserve units had their own equipment which was kept in storage . 
  note : those 800.000 troops were not the whole reserve , just the part that was actually ` organized ' and could have been reactivated on short notice . 
  thanks to conscription the total number of reserves was ~ 2 million . 
  these days , conscription is suspended and so is cold war . 
  i ca n't really give you any reliable numbers , but they should be a loooot smaller than 25 years ago . 
  there still are a few inactive units , but they could n't bring any additional firepower to the battle since they do n't have their own equipment . 
  debit card for  10 $ , cash for the rest . 
  and i wish we would get rid of 1 and 2 cent coins . 
  and 1 $ - coins should be replaced by bills . 
  i remember getting lost in a swedish forest because the hiking trail was completely overgrown ad someone seemed to have rotated all the signs by 90 \u00b0 . 
  eventually found a narrow dirt road where we were almost killed by a lumber truck going at least 500km/h . 
  estonia . 
  for bar owners and nazis . 
  only the catholics . 
  i think they vandalise doors by drawing radom numbers on them with chalk or something . 
  just say fap-brewery , trust me .

  sure ? 
  i 'm 99 % sure it only means unimportant village . 
  when i 'm in spain or france some people think i 'm from an english-speaking country because my english seems to be pretty good . 
  but that does n't happen too often because i look way too german . 
  scandinavian countries are a close second . 
  killing people is a no-no most of the time . 
  but the rest of the world is obsessed with them . 
  we do n't have syrian beggars . 
  neolithic . 
  all the time . 
  til i 'm a colonialist . 
  not me . 
  march or april i think . 
  would the state still be the one that makes them free if it decides to take their freedom away ? 
   alpenrepublik every german newspaper article on austria ever . 
  i just spilled my ~ ~ oil ~ ~ drink . 
  i would n't be worried about that trump guy if the us were a joke . 
  yes , no one has the right to force free people to risk their lives . 
  it 's wonderful . 
  it 's cold enough to make you uncomfortable but still not cold enough for nature to have mercy with us and cover the miserable landscape with a layer of snow . 
  and i saw the sun last week . 
  i would guess through centuries of war , murder , intrigues , incest , oppression , backstabbery , decadence and general cheekiness . 
  but i might be wrong . 
  weird things happened in germany during the nsu trials ( that terrorist organisation that killed some people in the early 2000s ) . 
  several wittnesses died mysteriously , some of them before they could testify anything . 
  two of them burned in their cars , most of them were in their early twenties , the oldest one was 39 years old . 
  has anyone ever seen her housemate and finland in the same room at the same time ???? 
  yes . 
  what you need to understand is that germany did n't change much during the 40s and 50s . 
  it was the late 60s that turned things around . 
  9 years of english , 7 years of french , 3 years of spanish , 2 years of latin . 
  i 'm only fluent in english , i can sort of get by in french and i remember some phrases in spanish . 
  reading is easier , i can read anything in english , quite a bit less in french , my spanish reading comprehension is almost as good as in french for some reason . 
  latin * then * english ? 
  wow . 
  big strange country . 
  full of people and contrasts . 
  and poop , according to those wiggly mouse-drawn comics . 
  yes and yes . 
  eu was founded in 1993 . 
  `` gn\u00e4 ` frau ... '' * tips fedora *, 
  it 's so hard for me to read dialects , they 're not meant to be written down . 
  that 's some weird platt . 
  i was joking . 
  however , plattdeutsch is almost dead . 
  note that this does not apply to glorious north germans as we are born with the ability to express our thoughts in the purest kind of german you 've ever heard . 
  slam that emergency button and climb out . 
  i cracked up in the middle of english class when i stumbled upon * to abseil * in the dictionary . 
  * abseilen * could also mean * to take a dump * in german . 
  probably the last word i expected to see in the oxford dictionary .

  you 've got a [ +4 ] upvote counter , we 've met i think . 
  do i look like i have n't ? 
  i do n't think this is a very german thing at all , i 've been on a few exchanges as a student and german schools are sooo laid-back compared to france for example . 
  abi 2013 . 
  less in my experience . 
  that 's the path to the dark side . 
  some teachers wanted us to stand up to greet them . 
  maybe i 'm just thirsty af , but there are hot women everywhere . 
  tbh your women all look like 40 + , even if they 're just 15 . 
  must be the smoking . 
  not at all . 
  but our ruling party happens to be a little conservative , which also stems from religiousness .
