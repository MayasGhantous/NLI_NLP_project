  sure , but the us still aim to be a dominant power . 
  it 's an official policy , you can downvote me all you want . 
  do n't think so . 
  you could save so much money if you just gave up on that whole superpower/world domination thing . 
  that military is ridiculous . 
  ^ ^ ^ those ^ ^ ^ stupid ^ ^ ^ sexy ^ ^ ^ fighter ^ ^ ^ jets ^ ^ ^ though, 
  in germany you will see [ these ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/412d6lktatl.jpg ) everywhere in winter . 
  since most parts of the country only get 30 + cm of snow once in a lifetime , you do n't really have to shovel your way to the road . 
  frozen windshields and wipers are the biggest issue . 
  and many people do n't even live in suburbs -  no driveway . 
  pray that the snow plow does n't wall in your car when you park it on the side of the road . 
  every city i 've ever lived in had one , i 'm tired of it . 
  always feels like you 're living in a village . 
  i expect the land mass itself to mostly keep its current shape . 
  depends on who you ask . 
  generally i would say it does play a certain role , however most people are aware/accept that a german citizen could have any ethnicity . 
  except for the notoriously intolerant old/uneducated/rural people . 
  you should keep in mind however that many people also think that truly * being german * is more than just being a citizen , that 's only the formal part of being german . 
  and that also means only ethnic germans can be true germans . 
  but like i said , it all depends on who you ask . 
  berlin you say ? 
  which part of germany will we lose this time ? 
  place your bets now !, 
  plot twist : it 's an austrian . 
  english songs are obviously very popular , but i also feel like german songs are getting more popular atm . 
  french and spanish ones are rare , but not unheard of ( enrique iglesias , stroma , indila , ... ) . 
  what do they sing ? 
  temperatures are ok , less rain would n't hurt . 
  but what drives me nuts is the inconsistency , the weather never stays the same for more than 3 days . 
  true , standard german is also associated with high social status/education . 
  dialects not so much . 
  besides chimney sweepers i can only think of executioners ( bad luck obviously ) . 
  chimney sweepers are also a sign of good luck in germany . 
  i think it 's because centuries ago it was quite common that entire neighborhoods burned down because someone had n't had their chimney sweeped . 
  try swiss german , they put that sound everywhere , even in words that should n't have it . 
  i do n't think rich people speak the berlin dialect , that seems just wrong . 
  it sounds like working class . 
  were a thing in the north back in the 90s . 
  i remember that my parents mostly bought bagged milk when i was a kid , that was in the 90s , have n't seen milk bags since then . 
  i just googled it and it seems they still exist , but it got pretty sexual from the second page of search results on . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvc0wblri1a ), 
   anyway , charlemagne is one of the most obvious choices imo as controlling territory that streches over a big part of europe . 
  oh i know someone who fits even better then :3, 
  this is why we have a higher gdp than any of you . 
  jaywalking = economy is doomed . 
  not really nazis , they are pretty much what they claim to be : citizens of the 2nd empire/reich , the state that was responsible for the rise of nationalism and national socialism but was n't a nazi state itself . 
  they are like an early stage of cancer , but not a proper tumor yet . 
   armed students some of you guys are alright , do n't go to prinsjesdag tomorrow . 
  we simply ca n't afford to spend our entire annual income on a 0.2 l can of beer . 
  no , but we have plenty of ( smaller ) military shows , they 're mostly open days though , no troops marching down the street . 
  i 'm from north germany , no lederhosen and oompah music , no tourists . 
  i think you were n't specific enough , the austrians take coffee very serious . 
  they actually enjoy drinking it , they do n't just gulp it down to make it through a day of productiveness , like an uncivilised prussian would . 
  digital stuff = black magic, 
  might be an unpopular opinion : [ alexanderplatz in berlin . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/alexanderplatz_in_berlin_-_panorama.jpg/1280px-alexanderplatz_in_berlin_-_panorama.jpg ) i think the place looks horrible . 
  if you go east from there it gets even worse . 
  it 's surprisingly shitty for a 1st world country ( like many things in germany ) . 
  it 's essentially a two-class system where the rich are better off than the poor . 
  but it keeps you alive and they wo n't let you die when you ca n't pay . 
  not very . 
  maybe you can find someone who knows some french . 
  and by * some * i mean * some words * , do n't expect sentences . 
  i do think most germans are quite patriotic , we just wo n't admit it . 
  it 's not the obvious kind of patriotism , it 's more subtle ( most of the time ) . 
  if the country is mostly european then yes . 
  have a look at argentina for example . 
  edit : downvoting wo n't make my argument invalid . 
  every country that is european or was founded/shaped mostly by europeans is part of the western world . 
  that includes russia , except maybe for some of its far eastern regions . 
  ca n't beat * dog dick ditch * or * whistling pussy * , but anyway : darmstadt - bowel city itzehoe - it 's a hoe gro\u00dfdingharting - big thing hard ( - ing ) neger - nigger/negro ( also divided into ober - , mittel - , unterneger = * upper , middle * and * lower nigger * ) kloschwitz - toilet sweat alzheim meinkot - my shit, 
  well , you 're not wrong , the german community is pretty connected , but in this case that only means the other german speaking countries are connected to germany , not vice versa . 
  germany 's role in this is that of the latently ignorant ` big brother ' . 
  switzerland is a bit of an exception , but austrian media is very ` germanized ' , that includes popular tv shows , internet memes , youtubers ... have a look at the german language subreddit / r/de , the content is mostly related to germany , but many of the users are austrians , swiss , ... 
  austrians are very connected to germany ( german media is very present in austria ) , while the swiss are a lot more independent in pretty much every aspect of culture and daily life . 
  no idea about luxemburg and liechtenstein . 
  germans are not very conected to the other countries . 
  do they also wear ridiculous amounts of make up and jewellry ? 
  and have pink cases for their shattered iphones ? 
  and wear spandex leggings even in winter ? 
  nah , i 'm from schleswig-holstein and know at least like 6 people who do that . 
  only women though . 
  i was happy about the 2-4 kiss thing when i was an exchange student in france ( all the french girls ! ), 
  until i had to kiss the beard of my exchange partners uncle ... 
  that 's odd , you might want to reconsider that . 
  bismarck did things that are the opposite of what a centre-left person would want . 
  his welfare system was mostly meant to keep the peasants at bay for example . 
  the most recent fad : replace the indefinite article * ein/eine / ... * with * 1 * ( only in written language ) . 
  well , i guess my point was that * todays germans * would n't see him as a hero . 
  well , that 's an american thing , you would n't see that happen here . 
  one half ( more like a third actually ) of the country is a bit fucked up compared to the rest . 
  in about every aspect except for childcare and gender/income inequality . 
  on the other hand , they also left us dope abandoned military facilities for urban exploring . 
  how could anyone see bismarck as a hero ? 
  he wasnt even a democrat . 
  and karl is a historic figure , i hardly see a connection to modern day germany . 
  pretty sure he did n't see himself as a german . 
  also , what 's so heroic about him ? 
  the only people who might be considered heroes are those who fought the nazi regime . 
  we have lots of famous people but heroism is pretty much dead in germany .
