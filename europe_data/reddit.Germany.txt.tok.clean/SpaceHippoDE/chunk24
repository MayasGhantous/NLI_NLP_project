  i really ca n't think of anyone . 
  in ww2 many buildings ( especially in the cities ) had improvised shelters in the basement . 
  the house i grew up in still had a basement room without any windows and thick concrete walls . 
  so if you ever find a building in a major german city that has a basement , it 's very likely that it was used as a shelter back then . 
  during cold war ( and today obviously ) , shelters were n't really a thing in germany . 
  do n't know why , probably because the possibility of a war was too abstract for most post-war generations . 
  and a simple shelter in the basement probably would n't save you from the utter destruction that germany would 've experienced in case of ww3 anyway . 
  [ what .

  because no one cared that much about the fate of some middle-east country . 
  that would 've been a total overreaction . 
  also , no one sanctions the us because that would backfire . 
  uhm ... ? 
  since i 'm not from bavaria i do n't think i 've ever met an american here :p, 
   article 146 [ duration of the basic law ]  this basic law , which since the achievement of the unity and freedom of germany applies to the entire german people , shall cease to apply on the day on which a constitution freely adopted by the german people takes effect . 
  people were n't that much against it in the beginning . 
  at least in the case of afghanistan , iraq was a completely different story . 
  it 's not quite clear , but one of the possible explanations is rather obvious :p, 
  if only i knew ... jk , it 's about drugs . 
  the title means `` do we have any speed left ? '', 
  ( at least i think that pepps = speed ) . 
  the guy is talking weird shit that makes almost no sense .

  `` reasonable '' sounds like `` riesennippel '' which would be german for `` huge nipple '' . 
  and `` cardboard crap '' in german . 
  * get\u00fcrkt * - `` turked '' - fake * schwedische gardinen * - `` swedish curtains '' - the barred windows of a prison cell * polen ist offen * - `` poland is open '' - when shit is about to hit the fan/something will fail badly/things are out of control ( mostly used like this : * if x happens , poland will be open * ) * holland ist in not * - `` holland is in danger '' - same as above, 
  finland or switzerland . 
  or chernobyl . 
  not at all . 
  we discuss it all the time . 
  that 's why people always tell us to `` get over it '' . 
  depends on how you bring it up . 
  if you dare to imply that todays germans are in any way guitly , you will not only receive stares and silence . 
  do elaborate . 
   not to be german with all the war guilt if you think that we feel any kind of guilt you really do n't know jackshit about this country . 
  we just make everyone on the continent join us . 
  it 's that simple . 
  what kind of people you will meet in a store really only depends on the neighborhood . 
  and we definitely have our fair share of obese , homeless , smelly , mentally ill , rude ... customers . 
  * hello , is this the eu customer service ? 
  my uk is acting up lately ... * \\ - * have you tried making it leave and join again ? 
  y u say dis ; ____ ;, 
  `` rrrawrrrawwrrrawwrrrarr like u know like uh rrawrarararararawwwrrarrar '', 
  i did n't even know those units existed . 
  eastern europe is everything that was socialist between ww2 and the 1990s . 
  eastern germany might be a bit of an exception since it was forced into a western european country . 
  and by * western * i mean * politically western * , which includes the rest of europe minus everything east of the balkans . 
  from a global point of view , the * west * is everything that is european or mostly influenced by europe . 
  that would include russia ( maybe with the exception of very remote areas in the far eastern regions , but those are n't too relevant anyway ) , australia + nz , north america and most of south america as well . 
   maribor is often called marburg not in germany , could be confused with the german marburg . 
  i 've only every heard maribor .

  bratkartoffeln are usually made by cooking potatoes ( not all the way , should n't be too soft ) , then cut them in slices ( 2-3mm ) , heat up a pan and fry them . 
  medium heat , do n't use more oil than absolutely necessary . 
  make sure all slices lie flat in the pan , else they wo n't be crispy . 
  season with salt , pepper , parsley . 
  onions optional ( not in the same pan/at the same time as the potatoes ) . 
  you guys always mention the * polish death camps * . 
  did anyone actually believe the camps were run by the polish ? 
  i only remember a scandal in german media where someone called the death camps polish because they were indeed often located in poland . 
  not because of who ran them . 
  the final year was year 13 for me ( counted from the first time i set foot into a school ) . 
  years 11-13 were supposed to prepare you for university and you could choose what you wanted to specialize in ( languages , science , history/social sciences , arts ... ) . 
  some classes were madatory for everyone of course , like german , english , maths ... - german ( analyzing literature and writing essays mostly , we obviously do n't have to learn it anymore ) - english ( same as above ) - french ( almost the same as above , we were supposed to be good enough to read classic pieces of french literature at this point , in reality we just kinda winged it and the teacher made the tests really easy ) - spanish ( i only had 3 years of spanish , so we were stil busy learning grammar and all that , no advanced reading as in the other languages ) - maths ( geometry , analysis , stochastics ) - chemistry ( all kinds of things , ca n't remember , could have chosen physics , computer science or biology instead ) - religious studies ( no bible club , think of ehtics and some philosophy with a focus on selected religions . 
  could have chosen actual philosophy classes instead . ), 
  - history ( from the early middle ages to the end of cold war , pretty eurocentric though ) - pe ( we could choose from a handful of options , like basketball , football , gymnastics ... ), 
  legoland billund in denmark when i was 4 . 
  the shores were n't exotic for me , because they look just like where we lived back then . 
  maybe not that false . 
  i 'm no ~ ~ etymololo ~ ~ word historian but i imagine that both words might share the same origin . 
  being full of food and full of alcohol is almost the same after all . 
  * satt * - the adjective that describes the state of not being hungry anymore . 
  sadly , german still lacks a word for not being thirsty . 
  i only write in cursive when there is no time to lift the pen off the paper . 
  does n't happen often anymore , so my cursive looks quite shitty these days . 
  ha , that 's exactly how i learned to write in elementary . 
  ( in reality , you would probably need to be an ethnic german to be a true german . ), 
  ~ 15-20 euros per semester on average ( that would be 1 or 2 books ) . 
  and that 's only because i like to have my own books instead of using one from the library . 
  we are totally aware of that , it 's hard not to notice with everyone pointing it out all the time . 
  but we still have our gdp , so fuck the haters . 
  who says she did n't ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  not german though , just the local dialect . 
  `` he who eats much , shits much . '', 
  but they have big furry animals and stuff . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  german ( both nationality and ethnicity ) 2 . 
  schleswig-holstein ( the state where i was born etc , do n't live there right now , but it shapes you in a way ... the habit of not leaving your house without a light jacket/umbrella for example :p ) 3 . 
  german-speaking countries 4 . 
  + netherlands and maybe scandinavia 5 . 
  + rest of europe 6 . people who love sunny places but burn way too fast, 
  i imagine you sitting in the corner of the sub , a giant sombrero hiding your face like [ this ] ( http://thumbs3.picclick.com/d/w1600/pict/281725888478_/lucky-luke-heimo-1972-mexikaner.jpg ) , but i 'm having trouble picturing the popcorn part . 
  probably the people who talk shit about entire nations here .

  do you prefer `` g'day , m8 !, 
  jolly good show *, 
  you were lucky then . 
  upward mobility is n't too common . 
  education is pretty much inherited . 
  if your parents are educated , you will probably reach the same or a higher level of education .
