  last time i checked more than 70 % in germany agreed with same-sex marriage , but as long as people still think merkel is the only way to go ... when asked why she does n't want equal rights for homosexuals , she said she did n't feel comfortable with it ... 
  i do n't think i need to explain why many europeans do n't like russia right now , but in this case no one really cares about armenia and their air-defense . 
  that 's no anti-russian thing . 
  nothing is actually worth something . 
  except for things that are useful . 
  how ? 
  is this disaster-proof ? 
  think of a major black out , natural disasters , war , ... what happens then ? 
  will we need to buy food with cigarettes ? 
  on top of that , the more liberal part of me does n't like the idea that all transactions can be easily tracked by the government . 
  should n't be a problem in a good democracy , but you ca n't assume the government will always be the ` good guys ' . 
  or a constitution . 
  i knew that you wanted to leave the eu , but you did n't have to go full atlantis ... 
  i thought that was obvious to everyone ? 
  what about africa ? 
  `` heil from the other siiiiiiide ... '', 
  let 's see what russians will think of putin in 15 years , 
  something something lazy mediterraneans, 
  safe and free .

  it is if you are right wing i guess , 
  serious question : how do people * not * kill themselves 2 months after birth ? 
  fondue or raclette . 
  lol, 
  not much military industry ? 
  us carrying germany ? 
  what dimension do you live in ? 
  no , they were supposed to replace both , the f4 and tornado ( see my other comment above ) . 
  yes , it was . 
  in the beginning ( 1980s ) the ef was meant for air-to-air operations only . 
  cold war ended and the eurpean air forces changed their minds , the ef was now a multi-role fighter . 
  however , now the german mod seems to have changed it 's mind again . 
  reasons for that are possibly that the ef wo n't be able to carry us nuclear bombs ( b61 ) , that 's the tornado 's task right now . 
  but afaik the ef will still be fitted with bombs ( guided/unguided ) and cruise missiles , just as planned . 
  not sure if this is a good idea , sounds risky and expensive . 
  actually , germany 's mod is n't quite satisfied with the german defense industry right now , things get really expensive and take way too long . 
  how about no ... we will go bankrupt and greece needs to give us a loan if we buy that . 
  sell the battery for $ 24961462522449368 , which is a little cheaper than the original price . 
  you need some colonies to make you happy , go and find india !, 
  the gas will leak the day after ... 
  but skinny teenage boys are easy to rob and always have the latest smartphones ... 
  but they also support merkel , who disagrees with same rights for homosexuals because she does n't feel comfortable with it ... [ source , german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_erfnte1hgw ) .

  if i had the choice of inviting either a `` normal '' person who just happens to be from syria or inviting a weirdo from the streets ... i 'm sorry but i would n't want the average homeless in my house . 
  waiting for turkey to close the bosphorus ... 
  if people speak really fast it actually sounds like russian sometimes . 
  my german has been confused with french quite a few times already . 
  do n't ask me how , but it happened . 
  personally , i have confused french with russian before , even though i speak french myself ... 
  why only sweden ? 
  should n't everyone focus on their domestic security before trying to win a war that ca n't be won ? 
  now that 's a twist . 
   ... everyone in who is persecuted ... how does that contradict this :  we dont have to take anybody that enters germany from a safe country . 
  well , i was mostly talking about the pre-refugee crisis era . 
  and germany definitely had limited immigration then , it makes sense . 
  but since the germany constitution forces the government to let everyone in who is persecuted ... 
  it is debated , some say it 's racist , others say it 's not . 
  but it surely is part of the cdus official position on immigration . 
  that `` islam belongs/is part of germany '' thing was completely overrated , she was just stating the obvious imo . 
  that does n't really explain why the 3rd generation is still lagging behind though . 
  what merkel wants is not integration , she and the cdu want assimilation . 
  that 's a difference . 
  yeah , immigrants in germany are usually pretty well integrated ( if you measure integration with education , income , etc. 
  ) , especially the 2nd/3rd generations . 
  an exception are ethnic turks , no one really knows why . 
  most people tried to explain it with religion ( most immigrants in germany are christians , at least before the refugee thing ) but i 've heard of recent sutdies that suggest it 's not the religion either that explains the lack of integration amongst turks ( no idea where i can find those studies , so i 'm kinda lacking proof here ) . 
  the turks also happen to be the largest group of immigrants , that 's why people might think mulitculturalism is a bad idea for germany . 
  no it 's not funny or weird . 
  the opposite of multiculturalism does n't mean no immigration . 
  it simply means that you want assimilation instead of integration ( just google `` leitkultur '' , it 's pretty much the opposite of multicurluralism and is one of the main points of merkel and her party ) . 
  i 'm afraid the opposite would happen ... 
  right ? 
  that 's why i was talking about the baltics and not eastern europe :d, 
  i 'm talking about the 3 baltic ones . 
  that 's why i wrote `` total war '' . 
  many people would probably think it would be wise to let russia have those tiny states . 
  it 's a war thing . 
  you know , atlantikwall and stuff . 
  all roads flee from moscow ? 
  same here . 
  people look at me like i 'm some sort of primitive animal when i tell them i drink tap water ... 
  even * if * that happened , nato is still probably the most powerful military alliance the world has ever seen . 
  russia could take the baltic and lose it again after a few weeks or months . 
  you ca n't win a `` total '' war against nato on it 's own territory . 
  when i was a fifth-grader learning english , i thought ` boxing day ' meant the brits bash their * fookin ` eads in * . 
  let 's hope erdotrump is n't a redditor ... 
  nothing happened , huh ? 
  why ? 
  well , probably because 99.9 % think the way you do . 
  what you on about , bruh ? 
  you are right , i really do n't want to celebrate oktoberfest in north germany . 
  it 's not big news outside of germany because this small contribution wo n't do a lot . 
  it 's just the typical german way : `` ugh , we got ta do something but we do n't really want to ... send something that does n't go boom or whatever ... '' . 
  yes , they are part of european architecture because at some point people started building them . 
  why should n't they build mosques with minarets as well then ?
