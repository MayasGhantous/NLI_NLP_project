  and calling germany a leftist country ... eh . 
  no one knows . 
  that 's all we know . 
  west ist cold sea , must you go south ... xaxaxa in south is also russia !, 
  the dice has spoken . 
  just accept it . 
  compare that to countries like romania , austria , switzerland , belgium , ... and sweden is definitely a medium power . 
  like it always does : it does n't . 
  that is simply not true . 
  maybe if we talk about interventions and expeditionary forces . 
  both italy and germany have large , well-equipped , well-trained forces . 
  and then there is the medium ones like spain , poland , sweden . 
  just got to wikipedia and compare some of the militaries ( strength , weapons , funding , ... ) . 
  germany might not be too keen on deploying troops abroad , but defending germany and it 's allies is not controversial . 
   uk is one of only two countries that actually have significant armed forces you 're exaggerating there . 
  that would be the first time we do n't help nato . 
  europe ? 
  well the jets still have to land somewhere , duh . 
  i would criticize this ranking but since we are # 1 ... 
  winter is coming . 
  and by winter i mean putin riding on a kamchatka bear . 
  phew ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ most ^ ^ ^ upvoted ^ ^ ^ comment ^ ^ ^ now ... 
  but ca n't . 
  still wew . 
  it 's all included . 
  there is something dirty going on in scandinavia . 
  they were n't between 1966 and 2009 ( not quite at least ) . 
  better put some sunscreen on in the meantime , your neck is turning red already . 
  agreed . 
  nice , nice ... 
  i swear , if this turns into another meme ... it 's too cold to get your dick out right now . 
  you 're counting austria , portugal and benelux but not poland ? 
  poland is both very pro-european and a significant military power in europe . 
  last time germany was rearmed , nothing happened and people did n't really complain either . 
  [ check this . 
  ] ( http://www.iiss.org/-/media//images/publications/the%20military%20balance/milbal2016/mb%202016%20western%20europe%20the%20dramatic%20decline%20in%20combat%20battalion%20numbers%2019902015.jpg?la=en ), 
  our revolutions are usually followed by trip to france though , you sure about this ? 
  that 's happening . 
  that would require the libyan government ( which one btw ? ), 
  to cooperate . 
  you can just go to a country and drop off a shipload of people there . 
  and we would still have to patrol the sea which is expensive . 
  oh yes , let 's just build a wall in the middle of the fucking mediterranean sea , i 'm sure that will help . 
  * hunt ass * ? 
  so you 're saying there is no problem with having bases abroad ? 
  why did you even mention the us bases then ? 
  exactly , but the guy up there was talking about bases in general . 
  of course russia is allowed to do so . 
  but the difference between russia and the usa is that hardly anyone wants russian bases in their countries . 
  especially in europe . 
  the current german culture and leadership is much more in favor of deploying troops to warzones than 25 years ago . 
  like , they actually * did * it several times . 
  the current goal of the german mod is to enhance the capabilities of the military , not to reduce them . 
  to clarify this , i was talking about allied force 1999 . 
  is it ? 
  it has happened before and will happen again . 
  and also with the far-left . 
  if you want to produce good fake german , do n't overdo it . 
  if you do , it becomes turkish or swedish . 
  our entire north sea coast is flat as fuck . 
  and the baltic area is n't famous for mountains either . 
  you could just tear down the dikes and flood half of germany while you are dry and safe in your windmill skyscrapers . 
  there , someone said it . 
  maybe you 're so handsome that they are afraid you could turn their husbands gay ? 
  and you really do n't want to join the ~ ~ reich ~ ~ federal republic ? 
   traditionally , it is the protestant countries of the north that have led on progressive social issues , with the catholic south dragging behind . 
  this time , though , it is germany , the leading country in protestant europe , that lags the rest . 
  leading in what ? 
  in size ? 
  because germany never really has been that progressive . 
  there is not a single weapon in this world that can be classified as exclusively defensive or offensive . 
  the us deployed patriot missiles to iraq both times they invaded . 
  totally aware of that . 
  still , better check beforehand . 
  top . 
  kek . 
  better check with the authorities first if you do n't want to get you ass fined/locked up . 
  no terrorist zombies ??? 
  0.5 / 10 - ign, 
  so ... uh ... if you 're interested in a new government ... you know ... we ... uh could just ... like in old times , you know ? 
  would be no biggie , just ring us up . 
  rip ~ ~ hewey , dewey and louie ~ ~ baltics . 
  i thought it said * care-free * . 
  no stupid question at all , the downvoters should remember that not everyone knows * manx * . 
  that 's simply not correct . 
  but everyone is required to rescue people if they are in a dangerous situation . 
  well , you know what happens to neutral countries between nato and russia ... 
  three years ? 
  more like three decades . 
  or never . 
  an actual eu army requires a unified european superstate . 
  what we are discussing now is just a higher level of cooperation . 
  ca n't handle the lack of ordnung . 
  this fits way to well to be untrue . 
  [ confidential ] [ burn after fapping ], 
  filthy barbarians . 
  here , have a mutterkreuz . 
  shit takes time . 
  people fought with improved sticks for thousands of years . 
  even swords were basically improved metal sticks .
