  it 's the us navy btw . 
  enriched ? 
  who said that ? 
  i do n't think it was . 
  you did n't make fun of possible victims . 
  at least it 's consistent . 
  let 's hope it was really just a mad comeback that made everyone panic ... 
  if anything , we need less religion these days . 
  pretty . 
  oh i see , thought we were talking about a common european military here . 
  no need to downvote though , whoever did that . 
  because nato is not * one army * . 
  it 's a bunch of states that have their own militaries and make their own decisions . 
  it will . 
  thanks to him we 're stuck with this weird ass welfare system that keeps the rich rich and the poor poor . 
  not a duty really , but it does seem like a better idea than having ghettos full of potential suicide bombers ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ exaggerating , does n't it ? 
  whatever you were trying to say , say it again in other words . 
  please elaborate , i do n't understand . 
  oh sweet , a federalist fan shop . 
   moscow sees itself as the protector of ethnic russians from ukraine to the baltics . 
  this should not be so hard to understand . 
  but that ** does not mean that moscow ** -- however annoyed it is by nato expansion to its borders -- ** has plans to invade its neighbors ** and spark a general conflagration . 
  uhm ... sure ? 
  that 's why nato will only deploy a very small force to the baltics . 
  no to counter a real threat , but to demonstrate they are willing to escalate the situation if necessary . 
  that 's not what i would suggest . 
  keep in mind that even now , the german military is the 2nd largest in europe ( russia excluded ) . 
  it is , the patriot missiles are back in germany already . 
  i do n't know what everyone is talking about . 
  the german operations against isis have nothing to do with nato really . 
  since you are british , i suspect you know what you 're talking about . 
  turkey is closer to the missile bases than some european states , i just counted it as a european state in this case . 
  nato . 
  this is about nato . 
  how many non-european member states are there ? 
  2 out of 28 . 
  so for almost everyone 's protection . 
  mfw all power plants are right at the german border . 
  dem legs doe, 
  there is no weapons system that is only defensive . 
  you might as well use these to cover your attack . 
  the usa deployed patriot missiles to iraq both times they invaded . 
  if the russian wanted to take the baltics , they would be able to do so quite easily . 
  it would be insane to deploy more than a few symbolic nato batallions there , it 's a death trap . 
  the question is not if nato could stop russia from invading the baltics . 
  the question is if russia would live long enough to enjoy it 's new territories . 
  the answer to that is brutally clear : no . 
  millions would die . 
  and then there are the german parties that end on * - pd * . 
  finally , the boat people are coming back . 
  looks like someone flipped a giant table . 
  great quitain . 
  the `` wait until you see the next one '' war, 
  well , germany was still pretty intact after the war ... 
  no one here calls it great , except maybe for the anglos . 
  most nations would n't have gone to war in iraq or afganistan without 9/11 , and i dare to say that islamistic terrorism would n't have got so much attention . 
  for germany it was the first time we 've had ground troops in combat and also the first time we 've had fallen soldiers since ww2 . 
  the us-led 2003 intervetion in iraq is said to have paved the road for isis , which is one of the reasons europe is being flooded with refugees and terrorism in europe seems to be back , too . 
  the rise of right-wing/nationalist parties in europe could be linked to these events , and possibly even brexit . 
  now , i 'm not saying all of this was caused by 9/11 only , but i definitely think that 9/11 triggered a chain of events that is still influencing our lives today . 
  it surely was n't an event as big as the end of the ussr though , i 'll have to agree with that . 
  esepcially since the end of cold war was probably one of the things that led to the rise of islamist terrorism in the first place . 
  war on terrorism is more than just a war . 
  it 's what defined the last decade and the first half of this one , at least from a western point of view . 
  all i was saying is that the losing side is still allowed to say the decision that was made is a bad decision . 
  and telling them to remain silent is not what you would want in a democracy . 
  so all opinions turn invalid if they do n't agree with the outcome ? 
  no , the ones willing to take it a step further just leave . 
  everyone else remains . 
  london housing prices will surely go down once the whole financial sector has left for the mainland , 
  there there , your island wo n't just drift into the atlantic ocean and sink to the bottom , will it ? 
  you can respect democracy and still think that this decision was stupid . 
  democracy is n't some sort of game where the winner takes it all and the loser shuts the fuck up . 
  shit 's on fire , yo . 
  mr. putin , tear down this union . 
  in all seriousness though , this could be our chance to strengthen the union . 
  get rid of the hesitant nations and push for a more federal system for the remaining members . 
  sounds pretty harsh , but i ca n't see how the eu will succeed in the long run . 
  just look at how `` united '' we were in the most recent crises ( debts , refugees ) . 
  more integration now or this whole thing will fall apart . 
  the driving idea behind the eu and all the other european institutions after ww2 was to prevent another war . 
  we must do everything we can to keep at least the largest and most powerful nations of europe together . 
  * tips federopa *, 
  what if every nation that is willing to push european integration a few steps further just leaves the eu and they all build a new eu ( with blackjack and hookers ) ? 
  cultural identity only exists because earlier identities have been lost/gradually replaced by new ones . 
  you ca n't preserve culture . 
  this is getting better and better . 
  if it was n't for the kurds . 
  of course that is possible . 
  during the 90s nato and russia seemed to get along quite well , there was hope that ( in the long run ) there could be some sort of alliance . 
  that 's grinding my gears so much . 
  you really ca n't win as a german . 
  ^ ^ insert ^ ^ war ^ ^ joke, 
  there is proof that some of the german g3 and g36 rifles were sold on local markets . 
  not a huge surprise . 
  yes , but not because the bombs somehow manipulate the ballots , rather because people * are afraid * and vote for the right wing or something . 
  it 's only our reactions that are an actual threat to our societies . 
  i was n't talking about your source , it 's fine . 
  i was trying to explain that comment about how germany only has 1.5 airworthy aircraft does n't make you look like an expert . 
  people on the internet ca n't tell how much you know and thus they might feel the need to tell you about the truth .
