  their argument goes like this : we serve our local population with cheap internet access , but the population mostly uses services from foreign services . 
  it 's more expensive for us because we have to operate the bandwidth to these foreign companies . 
  my counter-argument goes like this : stop offering such pathetic services and provide services which are valuable . 
  instead they put political pressure on the parliament to force the population to use local services . 
  here , the two main examples are : 1 . 
  [ the electronic id ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic_identity_card ) 2 . 
  [ de-mail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-mail ) , a system for secure e-mails between bureaucrats and subjects both projects have been a pathetic failure so far . 
  i think the same of bollywood and hollywood movies . 
  that 's [ nollywood ] ( http://www.nollywood.com/ ) . 
  til that the geographical centre of the eu , i.e. 
  europe that matters , lies in my home state . 
  i am of proud . 
  the 12 stars are not referring to the member states , this flag was in use when the eu had less than twelve members . 
  12 as number is a ( christian ) symbol of perfection , of the apostles , etc. , as the creator of the flag explains himself in an interview : http://www.cvce.eu/viewer/-/content/6d23210b-865d-4f02-b2ca-2c30b9ed0588/en, 
  interesting that france24.com did n't show this picture in their gallery . 
  biased media , yay . 
  it 's rather plastic than symbolic . 
  is n't `` sex work '' ( aka prostitution ) illegal in sweden ? 
  from wikipedia :  in theory , abortion is legal in ireland if there is a risk to the life of the woman . 
  so , the hospital acted against irish laws apparently . 
  you can be christian and check the second option . 
  consequently , the number of christians in europe is higher than your poll , it 's 76,2 % ( cf. 
  http://www.pewforum.org/christian/global-christianity-exec.aspx ), 
  gay marriage and abortion are n't human rights issues . 
  in other countries , ministers are not part of the legislative process . 
  yeah , and he writes in the interest of his employer , the nabucco pipeline , against the interests of schr\u00f6der 's employer , the baltic sea pipeline . 
  in other news , the german parliament sues political activists to stop spreading around a report on mp corruption from 2002 . 
  it would be much better if the whole balkan would be a hungarian super-blob . 
  they would all have a common enemy and would n't spend their time hating each other . 
  i do n't know what you learn in school , but usually you do n't speak of nations when referring to medieval kingdoms . 
  in medieval times , there was no concept of nationality . 
  then , your logic regarding the other kingdoms in nowadays croatia is highly selective . 
  you say , that croatia ** always ** existed , because a formal kingdom of croatia was part of the hungarian crown . 
  but the same logic does n't apply for the kingdoms of slavonia , dalmatia and illyria . 
  following your logic for these kingdoms , croatia did n't always exist , as it was hungarian or austrian in most of history . 
  then the ustase regime . 
  are you really telling me , that you consider it as an independent nation ? 
  this bunch of genociding criminals by germany 's grace ? 
  come on ... 
  this level of nationalism really sickens me . 
  you should be proud of your history but based on reality not on irrationality . 
  my ancestors come from the german-speaking parts of belgium . 
  if i were you i would constantly whine how these parts were ** always ** german , should be given back and how we are a oppressed nation . 
  source ? 
  it 's interesting that right-wing-parties seem to flourish in countries which were fighting against the axis in world war 2 . 
  france , uk , netherlands , belgium , greece , denmark - they all have their right-wing parties . 
  the other countries have n't . 
  ( does n't apply to countries on east side of the iron curtain and italy is the exception ) . 
  you need nuclear plants in order to create material for nuclear weapons . 
  it 's all part of a polish world domination plan . 
  soon we will bow to our polish overlords . 
  on a serious side i say : good for them . 
  here , every electricity consumer is involuntarily funding solar power ( i.e. 
  putting pockets into rich people who have the means to invest in/construct solar power plants ) . 
  it 's not even paid by tax money but via your electricity bill . 
  [ no ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/roman_provinces_of_illyricum%2c_macedonia%2c_dacia%2c_moesia%2c_pannonia_and_thracia.jpg ) , [ clearly not ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/illyrians.jpg ) . 
  even later your statement is only [ partially ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_slavonia ) [ true ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_dalmatia ) . 
  the fact is that croatia never existed as an independent nation before the 1990s . 
  you missed nationalism by almost 200 years . 
  today 's croatian nationalism is an anachronism , face it . 
   the territories that were `` lost '' were ** always ** part of croatia and bosnia respectively , never part of serbia . 
  yeah , i know . 
  god created croatia on the 8th day . 
  either that or use the dirty free toilets on the small stops . 
  i prefer the 1 $ - toilets though if i want to have a dump . 
  but . . but we are not allowed to make a fire in public . 
  we are also not allowed to collect wood from the forest . 
  no , revolution is impossible here . 
  * sigh *, 
  it 's too cold here to go protesting all year round . 
  i mainly mean this part :  if you do n't pay you should probably tell the cleaning lady but the other thing also . 
  when you do n't have to pay , you do n't have to pay . 
  these people are paid by their employers and you are not required to pay them a tip . 
  it 's nice if you do , of course . 
  serbia did n't realize the cold war was n't over even in 1999 . 
  the mindset of the `` strategians '' is still dominated by it . 
  the nato sided with kosovo ( and croatia and bosnia ) because serbia is a natural ally of russia and needed to be weakened . 
  in the end serbs lost all the territority where they do n't have a 90 % majority . 
  a lot of serbs left croatia , bosnia and kosovo but you did n't migration in the other direction . 
  from your ( stupid ) balkanized perspective the serbs are the ones with the biggest reason to be butthurt . 
  beating up immigrants is bad . 
  wearing uniform can be kind of cool , but beating up immigrants remains bad . 
  if you think it is good , let me tell you : you are wrong . 
  public toilets are usually free in germany . 
  but we rarely have any left . 
  stations are privatized , highway stops are privatized , etc. 
  the public toilets available are usually in a very bad shape . 
  you could go into a bar and they will usually let you use the toilet for free . 
  the safest bet is probably the townhall . 
  you will always have free and clean toilets open for the public there . 
  do n't generalize your behaviour . 
  but in the end , the german tax-payer money does n't wander in the pockets of the greek population but in the pockets of german ( and other ) bankers who did bad investment choices . 
  we have now a financial structure set up where the banks will always make a profit because in the end the eu will step in and fund the system . 
  this will result in a situation that will disadvantage the majority of the eu populace : inflation , lower wages , unemployment , welfare cuts . 
  and this is true for germans as well . 
  in the 70s to 90s , middle class employees could easily afford buying a house , even when their wife did n't work . 
  nowadays they ca n't afford it even when both partners work full-time . 
  the low end on the wage scale is even worse off . 
  i do n't think so . 
  merkel is making sure that her boys in the financial industry make their profit .
