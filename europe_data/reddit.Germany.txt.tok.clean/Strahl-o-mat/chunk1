are you implying that netflix didnt know they will operate in germany ? 
  that they had no foresight ? 
  globalization is n't allowed to touch the entertainment industry just yet . 
  no , many shows get pulled from netflix now because it is n't very profitable for license holders . 
  my second run of lost ( first in 2008 + ) was interrupted by the show randomly being gone one day without any notice whatsoever . 
  i was mid-season 5 and really enjoying it . 
  i am still super pissed . 
  if they told me 2 weeks prior that the she will be gone , i could have finished it . 
  this way i had one episode / day while eating and it was a ritual that i loved . 
  then one day boom , gone . 
  not even those anymore . 
  i loved a lot of them but netflix selling the license of house of cards to sky germany was the fucking lowest blow by a company i have ever personally experienced . 
  that show was the reason i subscribed and now i have to wait almost a year to ( legally ) watch a netflix-produced show on netflix . 
  fuck you netflix . 
  again , you are just acting like some teenager here . 
  the relations between turkey and germany as well as political pressure in the refugee crisis and the nato alliance are all factors involved which have to be carefully considered . 
  diplomacy is n't a reddit circlejerk . 
  merkel even mentioned the eu and nato in this very statement - showing how much weight these factors carry here . 
  pissing off the turkish government is a shitty diplomatic move and personal feelings of hatred towards erdogan , no matter how justified , need to take a backseat . 
  you forget the politics that are involved and have a 100x more simplistic look at it than the government did . 
  the justice department , department of the interior , chancellor 's office , and others were involved here . 
  before everyone flips their shit without understanding what is happening : 1 ) there is a paragraph in german law which covers this case - you can not just ignore law . 
  2 ) the german coalition government decided to let prosecution happen after internal differences on the matter . 
  3 ) ** judges and lawyers ** will deal with the law and they may very well decide that b\u00f6hmermann has ** not ** committed a crime . 
  this would send turkey the message that the government complied with the request but the system has decided that he is not guilty . 
  4 ) ** merkel has announced that this law will be overturned by 2018 ** , stating it wo n't be needed anymore . 
  so yes , the justice system of germany will deal with this matter of law and the legislators will do their part to abolish it by 2018 . 
  your comments suggest that you need medical attention and need to be locked away for a while because you pose a threat to general society . 
  middle east influence , oil economy , and useful military installations ? 
  because they might force slave women and children to sort them and adjust them / process them and what not ? 
  also logged working hours are n't always `` work '' . 
  well in germany we do n't do the whole japan thing were you `` work '' 10 hours a day by actually working like 6 and spending the other 4 on yahoo ! , waiting for the first fool to leave . 
  berthold hansemann is the shit, 
  the best are the ones going for a full on veggie flavor burger , not trying to emulate something they are not . 
  the only shitty thing is the markup . 
  i am not one to hug the trees , i am as meaty as it gets , worse than a starving lion . 
  i need me the meats . 
  but meat is what should * really * be marked up . 
  i get it , demand and supply . 
  but the industry practices are terrifyingly shitty and i 'd rather pay more , eat a bit less meat , but higher quality + better conscience . 
  we are currently just rupturefarms from abe 's oddysee ... 
  yes we get it . 
  in your other ( 3 ? ), 
  posts you support trump and advocate genocide . 
  get a brain from the leftovers at wal-mart . 
  what in the fucking fuck ? 
  what twat is responsible for this shit ? 
  the us state department has to post this alert . 
  imagine something happening . 
  fox news & co. will jump on it to politicize the issue . 
  molenbeek + 50 other city areas throughout europe . 
  time for authorities to step in but as always nothing will happen except `` we observe them '' . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europol  the agency has no executive powers , and its officials are not entitled to conduct investigations in the member states or to arrest suspects . 
  europol , in providing support through information exchange , intelligence analysis , expertise , and training , can contribute to the executive measures carried out by the relevant national authorities . 
  it 's not even that hard . 
  just grant authorities ... but no . 
  must discuss and blabber for years in the parliament instead . 
   annual budget $ 94.4 million lol maybe they can buy a few ice cream cones with that . 
  since cologne i have frequently heard that moroccans and somalis are the absolute majority of the problem . 
  i have no clue how true this is but it appears to be a recurring theme . 
  it 's not 100 % useless . 
  but firearm ubiquity among citizens will ultimately cost us more than it will save us . 
  especially given the massive social issues in belgium and france . 
  the weaponry that these terrorist had access to likely comes from eastern europe , from the kosovo war . 
  maybe russian smuggling , soviet leftovers etc. ... 
  it 's not perfect but you can have much better control over this illegal influx than firearms being sold in gun shops everywhere in the eu . 
  accidents alone would kill more people than any preventable-by-handgun lone wolf attack . 
  no , he is a karmawhore . 
  literally using terrorist attacks for karma whoring . 
  nobody here carries weapons and idk how concealed carry will protect you against hidden explosives . 
  and judging from the videos of charlie hebdo / paris attacks i dont think it would protect you from ak-47 militant squads either . 
  good thing you 're sick . 
  it might have protected you : /, 
  til french guinea is part of the free movement zone . 
  `` h-hey guys would you please go b-b-back ? '', 
  `` ok ... :( '' -- the powerful nations of europe, 
  oh god , please do n't think we are all like that . 
  and a more accurate translation would be driving * stuff / gear * - `` zeug '' is more an assortment of things in its literal sense and the singular form comes from that combined assortment of things . 
  i have 1gb for 12eur and no texting / calling at all ( no contract ) . 
  fuck germany when it comes to anything internet . 
  ca n't even use wifi without crazy fees or inconveniences here ( unless at starbucks / mcdonalds / apple store and a few cafes ... most actively limit you though ),

  maybe if you add a few more insults someone will like you ? 
  probably not . 
  you know i just realized when you are a brit and travel in the eu you will soon be assfucked with roaming fees . 
  thanks for calling me fascho , very productive . 
  read my comment above . 
  hey , let me give you an honest response to your sarcastically toned comment . 
  i believe that , yes these people should have a right to vote and decide for themselves . 
  but it is also time that we sober up about the consequences : people who have ** no idea what they are doing ** have the power to influence decisions . 
  when you go and ask your doctor about possible treatment options for a disease , you want him to be a trained medical professional or trained medical ai in a few decades . 
  what you really * do n't * want is the suggestions of your car mechanic and nancy wrinklebottom from next door . 
  so why are n't we actually trying to address this problem somehow ? 
  if you have absolutely zero idea about economics , the eu , the uk , anything ... should you be allowed to decide where it 's heading ? 
  how can you make an informed decision ?
