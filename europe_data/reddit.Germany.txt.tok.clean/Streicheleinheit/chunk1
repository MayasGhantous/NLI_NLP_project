i think they are just hard workers . 
  and some of my favourites : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyizr6-_37i ( german `` neo nazi dr '' called `` dr. axel stoll '' explaining the world , german space program before 1945 including bases on the moon and more . 
  also contains classics like `` magic is physics through will '' `` television is the electro-jew '' and more . 
  the by far funniest video on the internet . 
  i have never ever laughed that much because of a video . 
  it also sparked many german memes . 
  best video . ), 
  http://youtu.be/mb9aaqspacc?t=1m33s ( start at ~ 1m33s , people laughing at train announcer with funny gay voice . 
  he then repeats his announcement in german-english ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo05d-_k1d4 ( wolfgang pass auf ! ), 
  15,2 % of germans live in poverty and single parents are usually the poorest . 
  and regarding the jobless rate , ~ 1 million unemployed people are doing useless courses etc. 
  all day so that they do n't show up as unemployed people in the statistics . 
  therefore those people are `` employed '' , they just have no job . 
  shameful display !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ this ^ ^ is ^ ^ way ^ ^ more ^ ^ impressive ^ ^ than ^ ^ those ^ ^ `` polyglots '' ^ ^ who ^ ^ can ^ ^ say ^ ^ `` hello , ^ ^ my ^ ^ name ^ ^ is ... '' ^ ^ in ^ ^ 15 ^ ^ languages . 
   `` our people are not perfect but our culture is superior to others '' the 46 % of americans who disagreed probably thought their people were perfect . 
  even if you zoom google maps out to the point where you start to see earth as a ball and space in the background , you can still make out the dot where we dug a huge hole for coal to burn . 
  https://www.google.com/maps/@50.9091995,6.5185557,5909m/data=!3m1!1e3 kinda cool to dig a hole as big as entire cities . 
  and if it means a few villages have to be moved , then that 's a small price to pay for a gigantic hole . 
  in summer you 'd probably want to be in spain or greece or some other place with lots of sea . 
  so that leaves winter open for german stuff . 
  there are christmas markets in every small city , and all the other culture stuff for which people come to germany is just as good in winter . 
  besides , snow makes german cities look prettier . 
  who are we defending against ? 
  we would only need a bigger armies if we expected to fight other eu countries or the usa . 
  i really do n't understand why anyone would ever vote for spd . 
  if you 're rich and content , just vote cdu . 
  the only reason to go voting anymore is to hopefully keep the fdp out , and that 's it . 
  oh god , just reading about the spd makes me mad . 
  also  some scientists see the wage depression in germany fostered by the agenda 2010 as one of the causes of the european debt crisis . 
  lol, 
  i do n't blame anyone who flees . 
  their country is just megafucked . 
  they want the men to come back and fight ? 
  who the fuck would they even be fighting ? 
  assad , isis , other rebel groups ... do you fight for some corrupt dictator or for terrorists ? 
  while western countries have drones in the air , ready to blow you up without any warning . 
  that whole country is just way too fucked to fight . 
  i would flee in a heartbeat . 
   european energy firms agree to expand nord stream pipeline with gazprom [ 3 ] = = =  this , after all the pipelines in the south were cancelled = = =  there is no european solidarity on energy security ; romania , ukraine , poland and v4 , etc , the entire eastern block is betrayed and weakened and threatened geopolitically by russian gas flow . 
  eastern block is betrayed by not being able to blackmail other countries anymore . 
  tough luck . 
   germany uses the institutions of the eu as a master puppeteer to show that eu solidarity means redistribution of refugees ( who are only 20.1 % syrians ) = = =  effectively setting up a refugee lottery where the winners live in rich countries ( on welfare , or working a minimum wage job starting at 1500e / month + + ) and the losers work for 200euro / month = = =  because that 's the appalling income inequality that is tolerated in the eu . 
  germany is not a person , and clearly refugees need to be redistributed unless you want all of them to be in italy and greece . 
  germany ca n't decide anything by itself , they always need to have support from other countries to do anything in the eu . 
  if by `` germany '' you mean germany + france + netherlands + etc. 
  `` ruling '' the eu , then yeah , the majority gets to make decisions sometimes in democratic systems . 
  the media says `` germany decides this for the eu , germany decides that , german minister says this ... '' etc. 
  because it makes a nice story line . 
  and that 's about it . 
   there are now 300,000-400 ,000 ukrainians in poland ( and millions displaced internally inside ukraine ) [ 4 ] = = =  but somehow these refugees and people in need do not matter = = =  i did not hear the german people cry to help ukrainians ; not here on this subreddit , not in the news , i have n't seen german donations made to ukraines ' displaced children . 
  and before you use the pretext that most of ukraine is at peace , let me remind you that syria is nowhere near germany to be a first country of entrance . 
  the situation there entirely different from the one in syria . 
  most of ukraine is still safe etc. 
  and it 's not like what russia did was n't condemned . 
   german companies pay romanian mechanical engineers ( working in germany ) , on average , 10 000 euro / year less than what they pay a german engineer with exactly the same qualifications and experience [ 5 ] is n't that amazing ? 
  it acts against brain drain . 
  you should celebrate it . 
  and apart from that , companies always do what gives them the most money . 
  so if romanian engineers were of exactly the same value to german companies as german engineers , they would pay them the same . 
  profit does n't discriminate . 
   = = =  meanwhile german factories in romania , pay the same mechanical engineer , working with the same machinery and tools , net salaries ranging from 400euro to 7-800euro / month companies pay what they have to . 
  apparently you have so many amazing engineers that there is no reason to pay more . 
   within a federal state , mandatory refugee quotas are normal . 
  = = =  however , the eu is not yet a federal state eu freedom means that qualified professionals ( such as doctors ) can seek employment anywhere they wish . 
  = = =  but healthcare is publicly funded and hospitals use public money to compete with each other to hire personnel and to buy equipment . 
  = = =  western governments fund their hospitals to take medical personnel from eastern europe and condemn eastern europeans to live as 2nd class citizens in dirty , under-equipped and under-staffed hospitals . 
  which perpetuates bribery in the medical profession in these countries . 
  i am sure germany would allow romanian doctors and engineers to immigrate to germany even if we reintroduced borders everywhere and abolished the eu . 
  and most of the highly qualified people go to the uk , so let 's collectively hate them . 
   i 'm always embarrassed when germans post stuff like that the feeling 's mutual . 
   just as it should be . 
  yeah , they should all stay in italy , greece and spain . 
  fuck those countries as long as my precious germany stays pure and white . 
  when germany did n't join war in libya it was germany hate period , when german export ruined everyone 's economies it was germany hate period , when germany `` imposed '' austerity on everyone it was germany hate period , when germany agreed to lend greece money it was germany hate period , when the migrant and refugee crisis is happening , it 's the germany hate period . 
  ... while at the same time germany is more popular than ever . 
  yep , kinda . 
  w is like v in english , so it 's like `` tsvai '', 
  helping those in need * is * christian tradition . 
  maybe he is just more active than the others ? 
  maybe he bans advertising/spam accounts . 
  maybe he responds to reports the quickest . 
  maybe the person banned in the pictures here actually was only violating rules etc. 
  we should relax with witchhunting and try to be rational , e.g. 
  this post 's title could have been that that moderator 's behavior is worrying or something , instead of demanding an unmod . 
  it 's part of sound changes in high german where many / t / became / s / or / ts / ( german z is `` ts '' ) ; for example tin in german is zinn , tide is zeit ( or gezeiten ) . 
  in low german ( in the north ) the change did n't happen . 
  that 's why people in the north often say `` wat '' , `` dat '' , `` et '' instead of normal high german `` was '' , `` das '' , `` es '' ( in english obviously : what , that , it ) most low german dialects are pretty dead though , that 's why only some remnants are left . 
  in dutch ( which is pretty much low german ) and english the change obviously did n't happen though ( english -  water , dutch -  water , german -  wasser ), 
  1,79 $ for 400g at lidl and aldi , so like 4,5 $ per kg . 
  please give back the mega thread ... 
  why do so many people here use the flair of the second spanish republic ? 
   will german and finnish customs check the files on my drive for copyrighted material ? 
  based on no experience or knowledge , i would say that the chance that that happens is literally 0 % . 
  if we had that little protection of privacy , that would truly be a travesty . 
  if you torrent in germany without sufficient proxy protection , you 'll be sued though . 
  there are rogue lawyer firms that sue every ip they can get their hands on . 
  so if you seed anything without proxy , they 'll make you pay . 
  english etymology : monday = moon day tuesday = tiw 's day ( tyr 's in norse ) wednesday = wodan 's day ( odin in norse ) thursday = thor 's day friday = frige 's day ( she is the goddess of love , related to freyja ) saturday = saturn 's day sunday = sun day in german it 's pretty much the same , only mittwoch/wednesday is different : montag , dienstag , mittwoch ( mid week ) , donnerstag , freitag , samstag , sonntag, 
  yeah , it 's from old english , so it 's hard to blame that on the gdr .
