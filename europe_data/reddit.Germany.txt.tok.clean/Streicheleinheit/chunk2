  you have n't been to th\u00fcringen . 
  i do n't know . 
  to me finnish sounds like [ gummi bears ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/gummibears.jpg ) , not elves . 
  it is so bouncy and every second word ends in - i. 
   i 'd prefer 25 % on low-paying jobs over 25 % without jobs every day . 
  ( as long as i am not part of those 25 % ) . 
  east german industry got absolutely destroyed after they joined west germany ( and had to sell their products in dm ) . 
  it was already known before the euro was even introduced . 
  here 's a [ video from 1998 ] ( https://youtu.be/x1ef0bbtuya?t=8m45s ) of a german left wing politician ( gysi ) saying :  everyone says that germany 's export chances would increase . 
  if that were so - if that * is * so , then other production companies in other countries will * have * to suffer from that . 
  there would be no other way . 
  that means we want to increase germany 's export and thereby weaken the industry in portugal , spain and other countries . 
  they get `` east germanized '' because they ca n't withstand that export . 
  that 's one of the problems that leads to a further divide in europe . 
  so , yeah , it was n't an unexpected side effect , it was the entire point of the exercise . 
   the counterfeit option would be hilarious if there was a nation specializing in that . 
  it was unfair that tax havens were the only ones being literally criminal nations . 
  greece could do it in the name of `` creative freedom '' or something ( like switzerland etc. 
  do it for `` privacy '' ), 
  * `` what ? 
  dutch again ? 
  that 's like the twelfth time i hear dutch !, 
  th in `` the '' is voiced ( \u00f0 ) th in `` think '' is unvoiced ( \u00fe ) the difference between thigh and thy . 
  i also remember it . 
  i had a nutella glass with the exchange rate on it . 
  the street where it happened it called `` panzerringstra\u00dfe '' ( tank ring street ), 
  i mean , the only difference i see is that germany is being open about it . 
  are n't road tolls and taxes always connected ? 
  if you need 100 million to maintain your roads , you have to get that money somehow , be it in germany or italy or switzerland or wherever . 
  now you can get all of that through taxing your own nationals , or you can have a road toll ( for foreigners as well ) . 
  germany wants to make some of the money through road tolls instead of taxes , just like all these other countries that have road tolls . 
  germans will also have to pay the german toll . 
  like everyone else . 
  no discrimination . 
  all money that switzerland makes with their road toll is money that they do n't have to get via taxation . 
  so they have less taxes + road toll . 
  exactly what germany is trying to do . 
  i 'm saying that all the money that countries with road toll make through it is money they do n't have to get via taxes . 
  ( = they are doing exactly what germany is planning to do ; they are making everyone pay ( own nationals and foreigners ) instead of taxing only nationals . 
  i do n't see why germany should n't get away with it if the others can . 
  you could also introduce a tax in italy or france or slovenia to pay , instead of having foreigners pay . 
  they 're doing the same thing in germany . 
  everyone has to pay it . 
  and germans get a car tax break to compensate . 
  so why are germans penalized in france or switzerland ? 
  but yeah , the toll is really stupid . 
  i also call the uk `` england '' in german ( and the netherlands `` holland '' ) . 
  it 's just how german works really . 
  it sounds pretentious and too complicated to say the `` correct '' names . 
  i do n't really care about what welsh or scottish or non-english uk-ians think about it . 
  just like i do n't care when the finnish call germany `` saksa '' or the spanish `` alemania '' even when i am neither saxon nor alemannic . 
  by your definition nobody is poor . 
  i also do n't understand his reasoning . 
  but i am certainly jealous and would also like democracy . 
  do n't you write 100,000 ? 
  it only has one lexical component . 
  un - - schaft - lich - keit are just derivational affixes . 
  there was no germany until 1871 . 
  so technically , bach or beethoven were n't german either . 
  i care when i have to read it here again and again . 
  i also care for anyone that is being bullied by a bigger state , so if their claim is legitimate , i 'm rooting for them and hope they do something about it . 
  if they do n't think it 's legitimate , they are just using it to antagonize germany , which i hate . 
  well , let 's hope they come to a conclusion then . 
  either go get the money from germany , if they think the claim is legitimate , or stop talking about it , if they think it 's not . 
  but of course i ca n't stop them if they just want to debate it every 2 weeks . 
  well , if they are right , or if they think they are right , they should go to whatever court might be able to resolve that issue . 
  but just whining is a little tiring . 
  an actually more realistic negative view of the usa would be something like : a `` society '' where everyone fights against everyone else , where the poor are viewed as the disgusting scum while people who happen to be rich are adored and worshiped . 
  the general population is deluded with religion or the belief of an `` american dream '' , or nationalism/patriotism . 
  they are vain , and positive thinkers to the point where they are unable to think critically , i.e. 
  they are confident to the point of self-delusion . 
  they are self-indulgent and fat . 
  and all that hate is hidden under the veil of false friendliness . 
  the police and judges are corrupt , politics exclusively driven by profit , including wars . 
  there 's a huge class divide between white , wealthy people and black/hispanic scum/criminals . 
  the for-profit prisons where people get raped and have to do slave labour are overflowing and nobody really cares when blacks kill each other . 
  that 's all the bad stuff i can think of spontaneously . 
  obviously not a true representation of america or the people there . 
  i would move to the us in a heartbeat if i had a good job offer there ( and if it was somewhere where people live , like california or the northeastern part of the us . ), 
  lol i am sure it will pass . 
  and then youtube will be blocked for all europeans , not just us germans, 
  `` farao der nederlanden '' oh , i thought you always just said `` de '' instead of all this `` der , die , das '' stuff !, 
  how cute !, 
  ... and now the [ pr\u00e9visions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3-ufpcubse ) . 
  we already upvote comments like `` this thread is full of anti-us idiots '' and the general talk has become very hostile and hateful . 
  so pretty much like worldnews , with slightly less circlejerking though . 
  but as long as you manage to steer clear of political topics , / r/europe is still okay . 
  why does your comment have any upvotes ? 
  it does n't contribute to anything . 
  pirate bay for ( mostly ) sciency stuff . 
  you know all those letter-sound combination from italian just by eating and drinking stuff like macchiato , gnocchi , bruschetta , cappuccino , ciabatta etc. 
  my favourite word in spanish was `` desafortunadamente '' for some time . 
  i think german grammar is more different from english than spanish or italian . 
  different sentence structure , german has fewer tenses and more declension . 
  spanish and italian have grammar that is more similar to english imo . 
  like english , these languages are more focused on verbal stuff like tenses , all have svo sentence structure and basically no declension . 
   is afd so bad that they will be isolated in the parliament ? 
  yes . 
  want to know why greece really is in such a bad position ? 
  it starts with a w and ends with an ales .
