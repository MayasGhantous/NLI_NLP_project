   i 've challenged people for months to point to one case where a company that won , should n't have , and they have n't been able to . 
  http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/10/23/naftas-isds-why-canada-one-most-sued-countries-world this seems like a decent list . 
   jewish funded universities have no place in hungary [ ... ]  this protest is paid for . 
  maybe they should have paid for your education instead . 
  or shown you some love when you were a child or something . 
   you hear almost daily how sharia courts and jurisdiction have total control in these islamic ghettos in europe listen to someone else then . 
  what you 're hearing is misinformation . 
   we do n't judge a currency based on how it makes shopping easier . 
  of course i do . 
  that 's kind of the point of currencies . 
  ( i do n't understand enough about the grand scheme of things of artificially devaluing german currency to strengthen exports etc. 
  and how much of that is actually happening vs. just a good story to write in a newspaper etc. ), 
  and the initial question of this thread was `` why do many ** people ** hate the eu '' . 
  i am just saying that the vast majority of ** people ** does n't have anything to do with the supposed bureaucracy of the eu . 
  all an actual real life person might experience with regards to the eu is that , if anything changed , stuff got easier . 
   i said influence . 
  not representation . 
  in a democracy you get influence from representation . 
  having more seats in the parliament is having more influence . 
  i just think it would be better for us to vote directly for the epp instead of the cdu . 
  vote directly for the president instead doing it via parties . 
  the way the americans do it . 
  good point . 
   it is extremelly bureaucratic , from my point of view , it only reduces bureaucracy . 
  travelling in the eu is very easy . 
  and from a purely pragmatic standpoint , the $ uro is pretty great , because i do n't have to exchange currencies etc. 
  no roaming charges sounds like less bureaucracy , too . 
  it just makes life easier and less bureaucratic for me . 
   it does n't have any geopolitical influence it does n't have much geopolitical influence because it 's an intentionally weak institution . 
  with most of the power still being on the national level . 
   while depending on the anglosaxons for defence nonsense . 
  there is no one attacking the eu . 
  and if there was , the eu probably would be able to defend itself against everyone except the usa . 
   germany due to the economy and population has enormous influence leaving smaller countries at the side smaller countries are massively over-represented . 
  a vote from a maltese person is worth about 16 times as much as a german vote or something ? 
  and from my math , a greek vote is worth 1.6 german votes . 
   ca n't compete with the us when it comes to skilled immigrants how does the eu have anything to do with this ? 
   it lacked a direct federal democratic system thus leading to alienation of the higher political class etc. 
  i voted for a party in the eu parliament . 
  pretty sure that 's how democracy is supposed to work . 
  but do you think we need to elect people individually , locally , fptp style ? 
  i definitely prefer relative representation , but i would n't mind if we had the system that germany has on a european level , too . 
  how about this one ? 
  i left out some of the symbols , but made it into an epic battle scene . 
  http://imgur.com/a/qrdpn it 's called `` starry knight '' . 
   dutch and frisian are north-germanic languages so they do have similarities . 
  dutch and frisian ( and german and english ) are west germanic languages . 
  north germanic languages are the scandinavian languages . 
  how is this comment even controversial ? 
  it 's just the truth . 
  the attacker was on meds to treat his schizophrenia . 
  so many fucking idiots , trumpets and rusbots here ? 
  same syntax , similar level of retardation . 
  yeah , it does feel shitty though if a doctor straight up does n't accept you as his patient because you are a second-rate human being , or if you have to wait 4 hours because rich fucks keep entering the clinic and get immediate attention while your second-class ass sits there forever . 
  besides , you are not even allowed to insure yourself privately unless you make more than 57k/year or something . 
  churches of europe this is a [ close-up of that churches steeple .

   germany suddenly went from a balanced economy to a mercantilist state to the detriment of others . 
  unlike the netherlands that have always been a mercantilist state to the detriment of others ? 
  and you could argue that a rising trade surplus has been in a trend in germany since 1980 . 
  the netherlands had a trade surplus of 10.78 % of their gdp in 2015 . http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/netherlands/trade_balance/ germany 7.57 % of their gdp in trade surplus . 
  http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/germany/trade_balance/ so the netherlands are way worse . 
  i have recently read that germany export surplus has risen to 8.9 % in 2016 though ( overtaking china as the country with the biggest export surplus in absolute terms ) . 
  i ca n't find any data for the netherlands for 2016 , but i assume it 's also risen for them . 
  so you 're saying germany is closer to the target percentage than the usa . 
  the usa really need to tune it down . 
  no , it 's a country of 80 million people . 
  if 300 people decide to kill someone each year , that 's not crazy . 
  8000 of us die every year because of accidents at home , like falling off a chair or similar stuff . 
  22 germans each day . 
  i hope safety when climbing at home while cleaning the windows and shelves is 22 times as important to you as the murders . 
  it 's 22 times as likely to kill you after all . 
  you 'd hear about a rape or murder every single day then . 
  it would be the opposite of information and just a waste of time . 
  oh , that 's cute . 
  compensating for the lack of coastline by pretending to be sailors . 
  while we are on the topic of racism and dumb random hate , how come the dumbest fucking threads always come from east europeans ? 
   basically all the words u/flavius29663 listed have greek and/or latin origins that 's just false . 
  unless you count words from french as words from latin which would be dumb . 
   but that 's beside the point - they 're all not germanic words you do n't say . 
  that 's the entire point of this comment chain . 
  it 's a shortening of `` frankish '' ( old english frencisc ) . 
  like scottish to scotch . 
  in german we call the germans living in franken ( franconia ) ` fr\u00e4nkisch ' . 
  the french are ` franz\u00f6sisch ' . 
  franz\u00f6sisch ** is ** from french , fr\u00e4nkisch is not . 
  it 's germanic . 
  you missed ` tend ' , ` sound ' and ` use ' . 
  ` phenomenon ' ( originally greek ) , ' % ' and ` essentially ' come from latin . 
  * and ` germanic ' germanic words : * worth , that , the , something , like , 90 , of , the , everyday , spoken , is , french , rooted , or , loan , words , to , be , for , more , or , an , i , find , furthermore , the , behind , them , can , also , for , a , warm , welcome , much , more , friendly , than , a , yet , they , mean , the , same , thing . 
   there was and still is a huge brexit scare that would be because brexit is scary . 
  strong and stable ? 
  til 10 % of sleswegians own hotels . 
  i think his `` old english '' is far from perfect . 
  i obviously do n't know much about old english either , but using dictionaries etc. 
  i think he should 've said something like  forstenst \u00feu mec not `` understandest '' . 
   ic wille br\u016bne c\u016b bycgen there was no indefinite article in old english . 
  and the sentence structure in old english afaik was more like german or dutch , i.e. 
  if you give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he wants to buy * one * cow , it would be something like  ic wille \u00e1ne br\u016bne c\u016b bycgen  \u00fee / s\u0113o mielc maca\u00fe the subordinate clauses had the verb at the end in old english ( like in german or dutch ) .
