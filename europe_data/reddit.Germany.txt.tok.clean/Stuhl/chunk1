not being dependent on poland is a good reason . 
  look at the ukraine and f.e. 
  bulgaria . 
  all the gas from russia goes through ukraine and if there are problems between russia and ukraine , bulgaria may end up without gas , and we all know polish politicians like to cause problems ... 
  that 's why we germans have two terms for that . 
  konzentrationslager and vernichtungslager ... 
  nordstream having nothing to do with poland was the right thing to do . 
  polish politicians bitch too much around to be dependent on them . 
  it 's not better to be dependent of russia , but still better than being dependet on poland and russia . 
  but yeah , i kinda have the same problem , i 'm conservative , and civil rights liberal ( not really left ) and kinda pro eu . 
  cdu kills civil rights , everything left of cdu does n't fit my conservatism and as an immigrant i 'm already looking strange at everything right of the cdu . 
  my former parties of choice killed themself with their left shift or general genderism ... 
  i used to watch it pretty often . 
  it 's imo a pretty good channel . 
   what the nazis did was illegitimate you could easy argue that it was n't illegitimate , because it got approved by the international community . 
  only after invading the rest of czechoslovakia it became illegitimate ... 
  so yeah , putin is literally worse than hitler ... 
  that in the end russia always wins ? 
  i do n't really think we 're really interested in partitioning poland again ... 
  so just shitposting ? 
  basically , i think the eu integration of the baltics was the right thing , but i would have prefer finlandization instead of them joining nato , that would result in them having to deal with their miniorities . 
  it would also take out pressure of the whole thing . 
  russia would n't border a nato country after the west promised not to go further east . 
  also i do n't think it 's worth starting a war because of any of these ( poland is fine though ) but that 's a `` feel '' thing , and not a real argument ... also i do n't think any russian in the baltics would want to join russia . 
  economically the eu is a much better place , especially if you have a eu citizenship and can go to germany , spain etc to work during summer . 
  we are n't talking about ukraine here which is pretty much the poorest country after moldova ... 
  to be fair , the baltics really should n't have joined nato , to begin with . 
  luckily for us they gave up their nukes , a failed state with nukes would be pretty bad ... 
  looked it up . 
  the first pic is from [ ypres ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ypres ) which seemed to be in the fighting zone . 
  where is the second one from ? 
  yeah , comparing [ gernika ] ( http://kameleonputnik.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/7/5/12750231/1631306_orig.jpg ) or [ dresden ] ( http://einestages.spiegel.de/hund-images/2008/02/06/3/465b19dd92c7f4f08688e7a34f399f8f_image_document_large_featured_borderless.jpg ) to it , it simply seems unimpressive . 
  that 's all what i meant . 
  comparing the pictures to the bombing of my city by the brits , the fins got away pretty lucky . 
  i mean you can even still see the building ... 
  hmm , alligatoah has gone mainstream ? 
  wow , i remember downloading his crappy soundquality free albums years ago before he released his first payalbum . 
  definitely deserves it . 
   nu b\u013cin , ja \u0146ipo\u0146emaju eto ** t ** jazik , i ** m\u0146e ** \u0146eravitsa eta . . but you get extra points for good usage of swear words ... 
  baw\u00fc is green, 
  himmelkreuzdonnerwetterverfluchte is theoretically also a word , but he uses it as a substantive , while it 's an adjective . 
  he has to add a substantive after that . 
   why not non-gay for straight ? 
  because being `` non-gay '' is the normal thing to be . 
  you do n't go around and call people `` non-murders '' or `` non-necrophiliac '' ... 
  like said , from a real politic view , nobody cares what the ukrainians think , especially because they 're divided by half-half anyway . 
  russia is much more important than the ukraine , which is pretty much just a playball between russia , the eu ( and us ) of course we can see everything idealistic and claim that everyone should get what he wants , but that does n't work , if we do n't partition the ukraine into a pro european western half and a pro russian eastern half ... 
  i 'm not saying that the eu should close all talks with the ukraine and never talk to it again , i 'm just saying that better relations with the ukraine are n't worth worse relations with russia . 
  `` no need to take honey from a bear ... '' if you want to see it that way . 
  tbh , ukraine belongs to russia . 
  it 's not really worth the bad relations , as it 's too poor for the eu . 
  from a real politician view . 
  the only way it and belarus should join the eu is if russia also joins . 
  switzerland or liechtenstein , i dunno , i kinda like these small rich `` rural '' countries . 
  also they already speak the correct language , kinda ... 
  that 's because they force every gay to change gender in iran . 
  the interesting thing its that female to male traps are considered males by the law , which means that they get all the male privilege , too . 
  which leads to some woman changing gender purely for the legal status . 
   so if they want stupid laws and we keep quiet , they 'll just set those stupid laws . 
  yes , till they find the laws stupid themself and decide to change it , like they did already twice ...  and if we do n't keep quiet , they set up the laws anyway because they want to show that our opinion has no power over them ? 
  yes . 
  or to make an other example : if someone is pushing his dick into your mouth , you definitely not going to take it , but will try to fight back . 
  well , except if you 're into that kind of thing , then change dick for liquorice ... 
  the funny thing is that stuff like that is exactly the reason so many people in russia support that law . 
  technically , turkey is non-religious country , as they do n't have a state religion . 
  over 50 % of bw would prefer being a part of switzerland than germany , according to some poll in 2009 or so, 
  reminds me of : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=steuqamtlxw, 
   in germany , you do n't have a choice , depends on the bundesland . 
  i think in bw the parents may choose themself in the end or so ... 
  how many germans does it take to change a light bulb ? 
  one, 
  reminds me of a joke : british weather and british woman : no wonder they became a great seafaring nation ... 
   we 're not a political union , we do n't speak the same language , we do n't go to sport events under the same flag , there is n't a common defense , every country has a different education system and most important of all : there is too much disrespect between different countries . 
  at the end it 's just an agreement about finances and standards . 
  meh , except sports and military , none of this even fits for germany ... 
  why invent on ? 
  latin is there , esperanto ( as a eurocentristic artifical language ) could also be used . 
  sadly it 's kind of alternativlos if i look at the other possibilities ... 
  but he has a nobel peace prize ... 
  no , but it explains why it happens . 
  north korea has actually a similar view . 
  they accept it in the sense that man liking man is a mental illness , but consider the fags to be western cancer . 
  iran also has an interesting view on that . 
  for them it 's also a mental illness , but they therapy it through a sex change operation paid by the state . 
  of course this is the official view and practical enforcement may be different ... 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1g4nn2/children_beating_an_lgbt_rights_activist_today_in/cags5j4 you see the 1 which means its a second account . 
   the need for a common language is far more important . 
  that will be solved by `` universal translators '' in the near future . 
  the kit is already testing computer translated lectures . 
   i doubt it is . 
  also , why do the finns and the estonians have to pay to save an irish bank . 
  i just assume that it 's an network and sometimes also the finish and estonians banks would be hit . 
  but i don ' \u00e4t really know ...  furthermore , if you make a bank save , you make sure you get collateral . 
  the ez have made the most moronic bank save ever - just handed over money . 
  basically they have made banking risk free - something it should n't be . 
  what happens if a bank makes mistakes in the ez ? 
  they get free money , from other countries tax payers nevertheless . 
  fully agree . 
  i think it 's because of the snowball effect . 
  saving one irish bank is cheaper than saving many german banks , who all held the papers of the irish bank .
