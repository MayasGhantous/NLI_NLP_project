  it depends , does he think they 're inferior because of religion ? 
  then no . 
  does he think women are inferior , based on science and facts ? 
  then yes . 
  merkel is probably going to reach a * minimum * of 16 years if she does n't quit herself . 
  adenauer governed for 14 years and kohl 16 years . 
  amount of time governed does n't mean anything about democracy . 
  we never even had a law forbidding re-election in germany . 
  she 's also only our 8 . th kanzler . 
  that 's basically twice as much as russia had , while we 're electing people since 65 years and not only 25 . 
  and that includes a guy who was kanzler for only 9 days , because the real one resigned . 
  wait , napoleon was bad ? 
  it was humiliating , but what was so bad about the time in comparison to the others ? 
  poles in denial . 
  he was talking about a nato country that you ca n't completely take over during an advertisment break on television . 
  yes . 
  afaik we even have to pay for their military bases . 
  except half of eastern europe was on our side helping killing millions . 
  these are flatlandkurds and mountainturks . 
  they have n't integrated into germany since like 50 years . 
  do it , and please report afterwards how it went and if you would do it again . 
   american complains about german-russian relationship our country is infected by transatlantiker that sell out the country to america with shit like ttip and bnd/nsa and you complain about us trying to keep a good/fair relationship with our most important partner in eastern europe ? 
  our ostpolitik with russia lead to russian people protesting putins revoting and them trying to get closer to the west . 
  your policiy ruined everything in half a year gives him an 80 % approval rate and a new cold war which hurt all of europe . 
  slavery is not free manpower . 
  you have to give them food , a place to live , care about their medical status . 
  we stopped slavery because it too expensive . 
  the only good use of slaves these days is as a luxury resource , or as a disposable resource . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lawrenti_beria#terror_und_verbrechen_1938.e2.80.931945 german wiki has a list , did n't found it on the english one . 
  [ 3 ] usual human experimentation stuff to develop toxics . 
  killing moscow prisoners while the nazis were standing in front of the city . 
  [ 4 ] this is what i was refeering to . 
  he tortured people in his prisons and then even took them as homework , personally . 
  they even found skeletons in his basement in his house . 
  [ 6 ] usual politicite in post-war germany . 
  and something about him being a rapist . 
  but that 's on the english wikipedia ... 
  tried that in the 19th century , they did n't liked it . 
  * chechnoslovenia, 
  beria - introduced by stalin as the `` soviet himmler '' . 
  seriously , everyone who does n't know about beria , read a bit about him . 
  dude had some unique hobbies ... 
  it 's probably still radioactive from chernobyl . 
  in south germany they 're afaik still affected . 
  [ good luck assad ] ( http://i.4cdn.org/int/1440555033837.jpg ), 
  recognize some independence seeking african countries ( somaliland , moroccon western sahara , cyrenaica etc ) and sent them there . 
  no need to pay money . 
  giving them recognition is huge for them . 
  that 's why we have to work together with the the rest of europe and turkey . 
  look at europe as a whole , not at single states and we will also basically have only boat people ( except the ones coming through turkey ( and russia ) ), 
  they would have sold the nukes to the first one who would show them money , like they did with basically everything they had . 
  the treaty was n't about : let 's have a fair discussion about disarmament . 
  it was about : give back the nukes , or you gon na start your independence with an invasion by both sides . 
  they did n't even have the launch codes for the nukes . 
  the belgium version is obviously not supposed to be black , as they still have both hands . 
  iraq was not nato , but an war of agression by the us and their cocksuckers . 
  afghanistan was nato , but 9/11 was considered an attack , so the invasion was considered defensive . 
  libya would be another case where nato meddled in an foreign countries interior busyness , but that one was approved by the un . 
  and i 'm not sure if it was actually nato or again an `` independent coalition '' . 
  week ? 
  they 're happening daily now . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  i was actually thinking about doing that , but i was n't sure if i would n't need it later . 
  [ nope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria_v_west_germany_ ( 1978_fifa_world_cup \\ ) ) [ oh and ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kod8ariwgug ), 
  this may be sound strange , but i feel like molotov-ribbentrop was basically the unions reaction to the appeasement policy of the western allies and poland own carving for imperialism . 
  everyone expected that germany will fight communism , so by pacting with them , they brought themself time and benefits to get better chances at surviving the fight . 
  nobody wanted to be the one who ends up the most exhausted . 
  but stalin-time in general is imo a high contender for worst time , but if we go by the thread title i would say there are others , and the only embarrassing thing would be the winter war ( edit : i completely forgot about the purges ) , due to unexpected high causalities for little gains . 
  russo-japanese war crimea war fall of udssr/jelzin-era time of trouble mongol vassalage there are probably more . 
  somehow this reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-57y72vq6u ), 
  til : the nazis were polish . 
  jews making noises in the attic . 
  try using that defence for rape , zoophilia , necrophilia and padophilia ... 
   so my suggestion has always been to bribe a poor country ( burkina faso for example ) for the right to set up a migration detention processing centre and sent every , and i do mean everybody , who tries to get into europe illegaly there for processing . 
  i think somaliland would be a pretty good candidate . 
  it 's a stable part of somalia that seeks recognition of it 's independence by the international community . 
  and then merkel says : do as i want or i 'm outta here . 
  and everyone will vote yes . 
  britain ? 
  reminds me of the time i was in czechia , and had to translate from german to russian so the czech controllers could understand us . 
  so yeah , you guys all really can speak russian , you just have to insist , 
  i feel like it changed heavy with the gay law , because whole reddit has a boner for them . 
  [ that one is more of a joke map , but there are some that actually seem serious ] ( http://41.media.tumblr.com/640d17c8d03e63437bbae87d37e44985/tumblr_ncqb2uylyc1s6c1p2o1_1280.jpg ), 
  it reminds me of one of these autistic troll maps made by / int /, 
  http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-07/cdu-fordert-rechtsanspruch-auf-breitband they at least seem to kinda try ... 
  http://i.imgur.com/qzvbfhr.png this is why we have a low amount of births . 
  this is not some kind of french conspiracy , but pure idealism . 
  the euro is basically france frontship , and it does n't want to see it fail at any cost . 
  i think they 're basically right , except , that greece is imo an exception ... 
  the ones who just bribe are the good guys . 
  the bad guys made you drunk , forced you to sign some papers and sent you with a one way ticket and no money to siberia . 
  your parents are supposed to finance you till you 've got your apprenticeship , which may take until you 're 25 years old . 
  you basically only get baf\u00f6g if your parents or you yourself ca n't finance it . 
  invade turkey , come on , get back constantinople . 
  they have to fight against isis on the other side anyway . 
  no way they can defend against a two front war against the glorious greek army . 
  they clay is basically for free !, 
  this reminds me of that time one of the pravaslavnij claimed that protestants were satanists because satan was the first to protest god . 
  to be fair , they were also anti-vaccine and claimed the jews use them to infect babies , because none of them vacine their own children . 
  and then the obvious third rome thing and the russian language being holy because spasiba = spasi bog ...
