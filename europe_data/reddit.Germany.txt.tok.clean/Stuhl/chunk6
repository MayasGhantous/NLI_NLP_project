  the assad family is a russian ally for like 60 years or so ... 
  well , that 's what you get for naming your country after a bird ... 
  the funny thing is , russia wanted to sell us k\u00f6nigsberg in the nineties ... 
  the ones that protected vienna and europe from the turks , maybe ? 
  i think the correct name is `` protektorat b\u00f6hmen und m\u00e4hren '' . 
  i do n't even know why you guys go for the japanese-german alliance justification . 
  the japanese army lost much political power after khalin gol and the japanese political focus shifted to the navy . 
  if you want to justify mr-pact , you just have to point out what the western allied did before germany and how poland forbid the ussr to help czechoslovakia while they annexed part of it themselves . 
  the allied basically tried to lead hitler into a war against the ussr and hilter-stalin pact allowed to ussr to open a vent of the german aggression towards the allies . 
  the ussr had to make sure it was save itself before caring about `` saboteurs '' ... 
  joint statement by both foreign ministers . 
  look for the article about a strong europe . 
  sorry on my mobile . 
  the opposite will happen . 
  france and germany agreed to start a two class eu . 
  both will work towards a tighter union and if necessary will will allow others to fall back . 
  everyone who wants to join them is allowed to but they have to commit to the goal of a european federation . 
  that feel when he is supposed to be my representative ... 
  i did n't vote for him though ... 
  ah interesting , thanks !, 
   fisheries ; the latter is the reason why they did not join the eu can you explain further ? 
  how does the fishery of norway and iceland differ from the eu ? 
  lol , you 're retarded if you think it 's `` lack of education '' and you call them stupid , just because they received a different brain washing than you . 
  the real answer is `` different point of view due to different cultural influences '' : after ww2 the allies and soviet union both tried to change the german culture into something beneficial to them . 
  the allies aimed to destroy german nationalism , while the soviets tried to overshadow it with socialist unionism . 
  the result is that after the soviet union dissolved , the old german nationalism , that these people still had , was n't overshadowed anymore , but they still had the soviet influence . 
  they are much more likely to think that germany bows down to the us to much and is n't independent enough . 
  this is why you can find nationalism to be much stronger in eastern europe than in western . 
  the austrian equivalent of gro\u00dfdeutsche l\u00f6sung would have been gro\u00df\u00f6sterreichische l\u00f6sung by schwarzenberg , also nicknamed [ `` 70-million-reich '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/70-millionen_reich.jpg/775px-70-millionen_reich.jpg ) [ . 
  he 'll probably start singing `` ten german bombers '' ... 
  god bless shakira law, 
  actually going to the referendum instead of complaining after, 
  just be thankful we do n't call you russians anymore ... 
  euronews sends in 8 audio channels . 
  language could be easily segmented . 
  the sports part of the news is bulgarian base , the weather is finish . 
  a political talk segment could be hold in french/english , a cooking show in italian . 
  an it show in german . 
  you will have to translate heavy anyway , so as well may use different languages . 
  no , poland is like a package of pralines . 
  sure you may eat them all in one go and be done with it , but it 's much more enjoyable if you take some time . 
  to be fair , we 're not wrong . 
  each country is allowed to do one per year . 
  so you have many different . 
  germany used to print famous buildings of its l\u00e4nder for example, 
  we already paid for it , taking our guilt is theft !, 
  i searched a little bit and the only thing that i found was the zdf that used the term in an advertisement for a documentation ( except obviously conspiracy theorist and those talking about non-nazi camps ) . 
  their excuse was `` wrongly translated from french '' . 
  while i think that 's a pretty weak excuse and blame shifting i can see that happening . 
  telepolis has other explanations : https://www.heise.de/tp/features/polen-will-die-formulierung-polnisches-konzentrationslager-unter-strafe-stellen-3378451.html their explanation is that it 's probably a slip of the pen when trying to specify the location ... also interestingly : jan karski created the term when he revealed about the death camps . 
  no german would use `` polish death camps '' seriously . 
  we 're already associating `` arbeitslager/konzentrationslager/vernichtungslager '' with them , so we usually do n't need to specify a location . 
  the only time were the word polish would be used is to specify that we 're talking only about the ones that lie in poland . 
  but i still would prefer `` death camps in that non-country with the weird jesus fetish that should be partitioned between germany , russia and if they have time maybe austria for the greater good of humanity '' . 
  it would be more correct , but just does n't roll off the tongue as nicely as `` polish death camps '' . 
  i remember other polls showing that china is also around 20 % . 
  as long he does n't name pigs after him , boris has nothing to fear ... 
  how about neuneuschwabenland ? 
  you can speed up your time machine with bottles of vodka !, 
  does n't that rhyme proceed with : wer wird es richten ? 
  nationalsozialisten may have been kommunisten , but i remember it being a totalitarian paramilitary rhyme . 
  edit : looked up : the communist one was : wer macht uns frei ? 
   and other neonazis have sympathy here . 
  would n't that include the ukraine with their azov battalion ? 
  from lisbon to vladivostok !, 
  i think the habsburg monarchy still has claims for jerusalem . 
  may as well get that one back ... 
  ehm ... if you 're looking into ways to partition poland , i would have a suggestion ... 
  in germany adoption is the only thing except name were differences exist . 
  i know a different poll and would have to look it up but i 'm on my mobile, 
  yes , but ask if they should be allowed to adopt , which would be implied by that and the mayoralty stops . 
  polls like these are often very biased in the way they are asked . 
  if you ask about equal rights you will get much higher approval ratings than if you ask about the implication of that . 
  there are three waves of globalisation : 1 ) goods 2 ) ideas 3 ) people the last one is kinda recent , and they want to stop it . 
  thanks , i subscribed . 
  is this actually a real party or satire ? 
  because the name sounds hugely like satire ... 
  but i would totally love a eurosupremacist party < . <, 
   were exactly is she sending all those replaced germans ? 
  mostly to the grave due to demographics ... 
  the baltics actually oppress their russian minorities , that 's why they 're scared . 
  at the moment , their russians still have no motivation to join russia ( due to higher living standard ) , but if they proceed to do so , that may change . 
  that 's something russia could work with . 
  batteries are shit for the autobahn because no speed limit results in much lower maximum travel distance . 
  you will have to recharge much more often . 
  to be fair , that country is poland . 
  i think everyone becomes a little bit happier when poland suffers . 
  build a camp in somaliland , recognise independence , deport him there until he finds his passport or a country that will take him . 
  support somaliland financially . 
  from lisboa to vladivostok !, 
  i like this [ one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/proposed_german_national_flag_1919.svg/600px-proposed_german_national_flag_1919.svg.png ) , but it 's too nordic ... 
  kinda , black is the `` german colour '' , because we overpainted the uniforms of volunteer from various states with black when fighting napoleon . 
  obviously , black as a background is hard to read so they used grey on maps and stuff like that . 
  stop greece and italy from collapsing + getting fucked by orban . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/badpolitics/comments/5of3h9/a_spectre_is_haunting_eurasia_the_spectre_of/ the badpolitics post about that book ... 
  [ better quality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj-afkcozzc ), 
  more like both should n't exist . 
  afaik he did n't use `` faggots '' but `` pederast '' ( not sure if it means the same in english as in russian ), 
   bavaria was a net receiver of the german `` l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich '' until 1987 for the most part financed by nrw and now they 've turned into insufferable braggards . 
   for the most part financed by nrw you guys went to shit 10 years before 1987 baw\u00fc here , fuck off , the bavarians at least did something with our money .
