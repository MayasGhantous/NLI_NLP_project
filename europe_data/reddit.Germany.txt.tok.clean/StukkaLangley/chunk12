  means if russia decide to attack first , you could n't start any of your own nukes . 
  beside the fact , that your numbers are mostly wrong . 
  you forget that the big chunk of military spending are wages . 
  the most european armies are professionals who earn a lot more then the russian conscript . 
  there are already some good answers there . 
  additional possibilities : - a lot of teachers are left and bring this politics into the lessons ( or do n't allow recruitment officer to come to school ) - to less contact with soldiers in real life . 
  a lot of germans know nothing about the military - there is the interpretation that the german military is full of nazis . 
  which is bullshit . 
  ( another problem is , when i grew up and you would say you are proud of germany a lot of people screamed nazi , yes bullshit i know ) - antiamerikanismus . 
  some people the germany still as a puppet of the usa and apologies everything russia does . 
  oh invasion of the crime was totally fine , there was never soldier , the reports in ard and zdf all wrong !, 
  nato bad putting 5000-6000 soldiers in nato countries all this are just my personal opinions and there are a lot more problems , but i would get angrier if i continue so i will stop here , 
  wrong , lets say something is broken in an eurofighter in estonia . 
  there is no spare part available . 
  then they will just use the part of another eurofighter in germany , put it into a tornado and fly it to estonia ... and hopefully order a new one . 
  but the mission in estonia will not be in danger, 
   their youtube channel is actually extremely good and even provides some english content . 
  yes , but i would wish more longer videos . 
   but their main target group is the german speaking audience and they could n't give less of a fuck what some guy in new jersey or ontario thinks about them . 
  but we discuss this matter on an international forum in english . 
  we are talking about a pretty important mission were we help an eu / nato partner . 
  why should n't we provide this information in english ? 
  if we do n't talk about stuff like that , we let guys like donald trump take the stage !, 
  of course you are right , but the whole story is a mess . 
  from the top to the bottom . 
  and why ? 
  because the bw has no support whatsoever !, 
  neither from the population nor from the politicians . 
  luftwaffe is only the german word for air force . 
  in the 60 . even the air forces of foreign countries was called `` luftwaffe '' in german newspapers . 
  for example `` die luftwaffe der usa ... '', 
  really you think there would be a positive reaction from the left or the greens ? 
  from the political point of view the bw is a clusterfuck thanks to our politicians and all the left wing idiots in our country . 
  ( and no not every left wing is a idiot ), 
  to strengthen my point , read the comments here . 
  it is just bullshit ( sorry for my french ), 
  it is wasted potential . 
  we have there a successful mission going on for 12 years and nobody talks about . 
  and believe me the german military needs every bit of good press in germany . 
  but the bundeswehr needs good pr . 
  they should have an english version and post it on all kind of social media . 
  it 's written in the bible `` do good and talk about ! '', 
  the missions are importantent and stuff ... but bloody hell , we have to learn to write better articles !, 
  more important , if the trade deals between uk and eu fails , the uk will probably accept just everything from the usa, 
  to be fair , the bus was boris johnson . 
  that goes all to the nhs . 
  i read it on a bus !, 
  would n't call it handcuffed . 
  germans tend to do things a little bit to extrem  but it became a lot better in the recent years . 
  probably , but europe must not rely on the us for defense . 
  yes , germany should really start to do more military wise , but history and nazi und bla . 
  stupid i know . 
  but he also praised putin . 
  maybe this encourage putin so that he will try something in the baltics . 
   i do n't know if it would be or if it would n't . 
  i 'm surprised you know . 
  that is the problem , nobody knows . 
  i see a more pessimistic path for greece outside of the euro and you are more optimistic . 
  ** moving companys : ** sorry but in my hometown was a company closed and rebuild 30km away , because in east germany the wages are lower and this shit got funded by the eu . 
  i am pretty sure , this companies would just move to another country . 
  ** currency : ** problem is , the drachme was not a stable currency , why would the new drachme be ? 
  would n't the greece population vote for the politician who promise to raise wages and stuff ? 
  and this would restart the spiral of debt . 
  the problem with greece is , that a lot of problems were never tackled and the politicians walk the hard way , instead to reform and tackle corruption , tax system and and and they tried to keep als this shit and avoid the reforms who were necessary and i do n't believe the next generation of politicians will be better . 
  where did he talked about the 2 % please quote , because i see only obligations , but he did n't said what this obligations are . 
  that is not important , he did n't said it then . 
  when it is only money , why did n't he said it ? 
  which incident ? 
  but he did n't say that . 
  he never said what he means with obligations . 
  maybe he means it is okay to give estland to russia to protect the peace ? 
  we do n't know ... and i do n't know what you have against iceland ( the only nato country without military , but okay ... ), 
   for example , asked about russia 's threatening activities that have unnerved the small baltic states that are among the more recent entrants into nato , mr. trump said that if russia attacked them , he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether those nations `` have fulfilled their obligations to us . '' he never talked about the 2 % ... 
  ask someone from ukraine if he knows the difference between an russian soldier and a terrorist ... 
   you get by with less energy , less food , less medicine . 
  it would be austerity but controlled by the greek govt and without the need for a primary surplus . 
  really ? 
  in the past the greece goverment tried to solve this through inflation instead to solve the actual problem . 
  why should it now different ? 
   why ? 
  you would buy the oil for many many drachme , then sell them for many many drachme . 
  if currency was a big issue , maybe the industry capital would just be bought up by foreigners able to afford the purchase of unrefined oil and make use of the new cheaper greek labour ? 
  or they just go to a different country which has the euro ? 
  and you really do n't see the problem with a weak currency ? 
  let say you want to sell produkt a. 
  delivery is in 3 month . 
  now how much money do you ask for . 
  you have now idea what the value of the currency is in 3 month . 
  it is about how unpopular the bundeswehr is . 
  additional thougt . 
  now is the time . 
  everyone who speaks against it , is an enemy of turkey and democracy . 
  look at the pictures of people beating up ( and reports of killing ) the own conscripts . 
  something even in germany is unheard of . 
  right now erdogan can do as he please and he does as he please . 
  but russia also has an elected dictator . 
  and taking away a third of your country and tacking away all your property outside of greece ... 
  no , it is logic . 
  you guys voted out , of course the eu wo n't sponsor long term projects anymore . 
  sorry , but the people voted again and again this leaders .
