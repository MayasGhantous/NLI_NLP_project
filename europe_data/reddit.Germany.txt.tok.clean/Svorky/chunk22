  criminals would just go to another city anyway . 
  people are always dying `` because of politicians '' , everywhere . 
  not as deep a sentiment as you think . 
  you also ca n't have a genuine discussion about what policy had what impact on this before knowing what '' this '' is . 
  so calm down and push your agenda tomorrow . 
  its the first big islamic terror attack we 've had , if it turns out to be one . 
  on a individual level there 's no need to be scared , its a very safe country . 
  hope you have a good time . 
  go away . 
  no , they 're assuming so for the time being . 
  ca n't really confirm anything without catching the guy . 
  where did i say i would forgive him ? 
  that 's separate from trying to understand human behaviour . 
  how do you know ? 
  whether you like it or not , a large amount of people is willing to , or can be made to do , horrible things under the right circumstances . 
  we 've seen this again and again throughout history and the world . 
  human decency comes as lot easier when you 're not starving to death . 
  afghanistan ranks 8th on the hunger index . 
  no the next step was to flee . 
  joining them is the step after being deported back and not finding a way to live . 
  so the argument is that this is all based on a rational attitude towards islam , these are just well-informed people aware of problems all across europe , that at the same time are stupid enough to overestimate their own muslim population by ** 700 % ** , i.e. 
  think instead of every 1000th person they meet being muslim it 's every 20th . 
  got it . 
  phew , we almost would 've needed to admit people can be a bit silly about muslims . 
  lol i was wondering how we could blame this on muslims . 
  the reason is clearly the `` ever present foothold '' muslims have in poland , not the obsession of the media , or that people generally are garbage with percentages . 
  must be all those muslims terrorizing south korean cities . 
  as someone that used to transcribe stuff for some eu guys as a student : while the eu get 's a lot of shit , it has literally thousands of incredibly enthusiastic people working for it . 
  since it is still so much in flux , everything is up for debate and changes every couple of years , it 's pretty much a dream for every ambitious political scientist and the like . 
  most democratic systems are very set in their laws/guidelines , and you need to spend 20 years putting in hours before getting a chance to properly influence stuff . 
  with the eu though , it 's immediate . 
  if you 're a 30-something high-achiever and want to get shit done , you go work for an eu-institution . 
  at the same time though , since there 's not nearly as much attention paid to eu-poltics as to national ones , it 's not the best career choice . 
  so the people going to work for the eu tend to be a little more idealistic , rather than career-driven . 
  tl ; dr : good people doing good work , no matter how much shit gets flung their way . 
  i have n't met many people that thought it was okay . 
  legal , but almost universally condemned . 
  it 's really not that complicated . 
  just got ta take an hour out of your day or so , once . 
  or you just stick to the broader strokes and you 're done in 5 minutes . 
  it 's so big because it has to be complete , to the smallest feasible detail and explains what it 's for , which ensures transparency . 
  there 's really no reason a normal citizen needs to read all of it , an abstract should be more than enough . 
  unless you 're interested in how much the bundeswehr spent on maintenance of their sanitation system for some reason . 
  and so while i 'm sure there 's fat to trim as everywhere , i 'm not sure how such a simplification would even work without having them shit in the woods , so to speak . 
  they even made [ this nice visualization ] ( https://www.bundeshaushalt-info.de/#/2016/soll/ausgaben/einzelplan.html ) ( in german ) where you can go through each sub-budget . 
  or they have a bunch of these [ ~ 15-page pamphlets ] ( http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/web/de/service/publikationen/auf_den_punkt/auf_den_punkt.html ) called `` to the point '' . 
  because they actually want to inform . 
  the barrier is n't complexity , it 's laziness and disinterest . 
  such is the magic of trump , he represents all positions at the same time . 
  but in all honestly he 's a republican president with a nationalist/authoritarian slant , governing with a republic congress * and * he 's talked several times about increasing spending . 
  it would be the shock of the century to see them reduce it . 
  he 's said before he 's going to extend the military budget because their navy - the one with more aircraft carriers than the rest of the world combined - is `` a disaster '' . 
  i would n't infer anything from his tweets . 
  i 'd laugh at the stupidity , but sex-ed quite literally saves lives and people still pushing for a ban are absolute scum . 
  ca n't link to the proper data on mobile , sorry . 
  here 's the best i can do : [ `` new borns by nationality of partens '' ] ( http://www.bib-demografie.de/de/zahlenundfakten/06/abbildungen/a_06_27_lbdgeb_nationalitaet_eltern_d_ab1991.html?nn=3073508 ) . 
  dark blue is at least one parent with german nationality , light blue is no parent . 
  fairly stable over the past 30 years , but ends in 2014 . 
  then [ here 's another article ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/geburtenzahlen-deutschland-erlebt-einen-kleinen-babyboom-1.3056948 ) about newborns in 2015 : in short , it rose by ~ 23.000 to 738.000 . 
  so a change by ~ 3 % is n't going to massively change anything . 
  there 's also a quote from a demographic scientist saying refugees are a factor , but a small one . 
  i trust a study from a well respected century-old german institute , yes . 
  you stick with `` therebel.media '' though if it makes you happy , i 've given up . 
  to become chancellor ? 
  merkel . 
  nobody will form a coalition with them , so they 'd need to win the majority by themselves which is impossible . 
  save your money . 
  no problem , was probably not the best word to use . 
  i know , that 's why i put it in parenthesis . 
  the refugee crisis made it a topic . 
  1/5th i think , and that 's not really new or because of the refugee crisis . 
  most of those have a european background , and are german citizens . 
  the number of non-germans is at like 10 % . 
  society as a whole ? 
  really only indirectly . 
  there was a study recently : `` refugees living here threaten my personal way of life '' : disagree ( completely/mostly ) 87 % , agree 5.5 % `` refugees threaten my financial situation '' : disagree 85.4 % , agree 7.3 % `` in my area there are significant problems with refugees '' : disagree 84.5 , agree 9.5 % . 
  so a good ~ 85 % will tell you it has n't changed their lives at all , but in terms of support for it 's quite a bit more split . 
  there 's still a majority in support of accepting refugees ( 55 % like that we took them in , 20.4 % do n't ) , but i 'd say that it 's mainly the debate about them that is changing society . 
  for 1.5 years now it has dominated media , and `` forced '' us to have a debate about refugees , immigration , integration , islam , europe . 
  all of it . 
  so the biggest change by far would probably be our reaction to it , i.e. 
  the rise of afd . 
  new party in the bundestag is pretty significant ( only 2 new ones managed it over the past 70 years ) , and they 're so far still a one-issue protest party . 
  no refugee crisis , no afd . 
  edit : [ here 's a link to the study ] ( https://www.fes.de/de/gespaltene-mitte-rechtsextreme-einstellungen-2016/ ) , in german . 
  the part about the refugee crisis is on page 4 . 
  we 're alright . 
  for us it was mostly by choice , unlike for greece/italy . 
  but merkel has said over and over for a year now that it was a one time thing , so the natural conclusion to blocking reforms is that we will push responsibility to greece , or really anyone south of us . 
  that 'd be okay currently , but if in two years there 's another 1m + year and we refuse to share the burden , oh boy is it going to be a clusterfuck . 
  we need to reform now . 
  but they already * are * the buffer zone . 
  that 's exactly what dublin ii is . 
  if the goal is to contain them in greece , all that is needed is to enforce current law . 
  why bother trying to push through quotas against immense pressure , if that 's your end goal ? 
  it has become apparent to everyone that dublin does n't work , not really ever but especially not under the pressure of a migration crisis . 
  containing them in greece wo n't work under circumstances similar to last summer , no matter the system or law . 
  that 's really not as big an issue as it 's made out to be . 
  `` asylum shopping '' - asylum seekers being able to freely chose the european country they want - is a big problem , and a huge pull factor . 
  even if they can still leave i.e.
