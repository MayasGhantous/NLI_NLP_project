  that 's what i do n't really get . 
  davis is a big name and was a leaver , fair enough . 
  but he has talked as much nonsense about the eu as trump . 
  there 's a clear lack of understanding of even the basics . 
  he had the same weird idea of negotiating trade deals with individual eu countries for example . 
  barnier meanwhile has worked within the eu for two decades and the actual negotiations were always going to be eu home turf , this is what they do . 
  like the great m. bison said : `` for you this might be the * most complicated negotiations ever * , for us it 's monday . '', 
  how was this supposed to go ? 
  surely there must have been some british bloke with a bit more eu experience to put in charge of this . 
  you 're right . 
  merkels example for that was what is going to happen with bringing pets into/out of the uk . 
  it 's not going to be controversial and the likely answer is `` let 's just keep it as is '' , but given the limited time available i sure would hope * both * sides have come up with a position in regards to those kind of issues so we can quickly move through it . 
   in contrast to well-rehearsed eu positions on issues such as the financial settlement and irish borders , british officials admit they did not bring any pre-prepared negotiating papers to share with their counterparts - insisting instead that their overall ambitions were made clear by the government 's earlier white paper and lancaster house speech . 
   oh god . 
  uk with the classic moves of a lazy teenage student . 
  it 's funny how by the time it finally starts , i 'm actually mostly worried about the state of the uk and hope we help them along a bit . 
  it 's been such absurd incompetence , it 's turning me into a conspiracy theorist . 
  first reason is isis being close to collapsing and out of desperation pushing people towards `` improvised '' attacks rather than trying to set up bigger , coordinated ones . 
  second one is that the principle of copycats sadly applies to terrorists too . 
  being extra sensitive ... not running people over . 
  what 's the difference . 
  it 's because for all the talk about dependency on russia , it 's actually a mutual dependency . 
  we freeze , they go bankrupt . 
  it 's why even at the height of the cold war , they never screwed with the gas supply . 
  so the goal should be to accelerate the push for a common european market , ending russian leverage on the smaller markets completely . 
  and there was an offer to connect eastern europe to ns2 through poland . 
  germany offered to give you access to our emergency storage . 
  sadly both were declined . 
  it 's not like we 're not ready to find solutions , but the preference is for solutions not hindering the free market . 
  there are n't really concerns , the german view is to stay out of it . 
  it ties into the liberalization of the gas/energy market within the eu over the past ~ 20 years . 
  nord stream 2 is a private project , being build because it is seen as economically viable . 
  for the russian side through gasprom there are those deliberations . 
  but for germany the goal is to not use gas as a geopolitical toy , but to let the market reduce prices through enhanced competition and connectedness . 
  ukraine is free and has been free to reduce their transit fees , in fact that very likely could have ( maybe still could ) stop the entire project dead in it 's tracks . 
  the estimate i know is that cutting it by ~ 60 % would render ns2 useless . 
  instead they , together with eastern europe , opted to try and block it from happening politically . 
  but out of principle , it would take a lot for germany to agree to any of those schemes you proposed . 
  norway is just the most extreme example of the punishment-restraint/rehabilitation debate . 
  criminology has been pretty confident for many decades that a focus on rehabilitation rather than `` justice '' is significantly more effective in reducing crime rates . 
  it 's often seen as the field where science and politics are farthest away from each other - because being `` tough on crime '' is usually a vote winner , and the general public is often interested in punishment for moral reasons , regardless of what this means for crime rates in the long run . 
  norway is doing what experience and data tells us we very likely * should * be doing , if the primary goal is reduction of crime . 
  and it works . 
   also , this specific setup does not make norway safer you ca n't just claim something that goes against the majority of research in the field and then not at least explain your argument . 
  yeah man i 'm going to be rich once gas prices sink by 5 % , that 's it . 
  this fight is n't really about sanctions in general , but one specific one . 
  but to be frank , sanctions simply barely ever work . 
  depending on the study they have a success rate of like 5-30 % , but the ones that are successful are mostly about tiny stuff - release a prisoner , change that tariff - rather than huge geopolitical considerations . 
  there have been sanctions for 50 , 60 , 70 years on iran , cuba or north korea and they did not do shit . 
  in fact comparing those countries to similar ones it 's easy to argue they prolonged the rule of the autocrats that were targeted . 
  in iran there 's finally * some * progress after half a century and that 's now paraded around as the big example of successful sanctions . 
  it 's born out of the feeling of `` shit , we have to do * something * about ukraine '' and i get that , i do . 
  but rationally they make little sense . 
  it 's not going to topple putin and fix russia , if anything it strengthened his position . 
  they failed . 
  and harder sanctions most likely would too . 
  it was offered to poland and latvia , they declined and opted to try and block it instead . 
  almost like we 're not the devil . 
  but we ca n't force them . 
  it was a reasonable move at the time , but maybe they 'll change their mind once/if nord stream 2 is finished . 
  surely even in the us you 've figured out that pipes do n't care whether they go from east to west or west to east . 
  oh you 're still here huh ? 
  how 's the evening going buddy ? 
  it 's trivial to connect eastern europe to the western pipes . 
  but that means no more transit fees . 
  what are talking about . 
  here is how the section reads : * ( 9 ) to continue to ** oppose the nordstream 2 pipeline ** given its detrimental impacts on the european union 's energy security , gas market development in central and eastern europe , and energy reforms in ukraine ; and * ( 10 ) that the united states government should prioritize the export of united states energy resources ** in order to create american jobs ** , help united states allies and partners , and ** strengthen united states foreign policy ** this is not some general stuff that hurts everyone , it 's * specifically * about a german russian project , mentions how it will benefit the us and also clearly acknowledges it as a foreign policy issue . 
  it is truly absurd for the us to not talk to germany beforehand , i do n't know how this is even defensible outside of `` fuck nord stream '' . 
  the us would go nuclear if we tried this the other way around , and you can bet your bollocks we would talk to the brazilian prime minister before doing something like this . 
  we 're all `` pumping money into russia '' , nord stream would not increase the amount of gas we import , it would just make it cheaper . 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't see why `` german '' businesses should have to pay billions every year for eternity to secure ukranian energy supply . 
  that 's a weird conflation between business and politics because `` ah , the germans have enough money '' . 
  in fact if ukraine would have waived those fees , the eu states could have made up the difference and nord stream 2 would n't have happened because it would cease to be economically viable . 
  or in any case there are a lot of ways to do this without forcing businesses to take on the role of politics . 
  ukraine is a little trickier , but securing the eastern eu states is simple . 
  if private businesses can lower the energy cost for other businesses , we should let them . 
  and then let politics deal with the political issues . 
  just because i have the foolish hope of this not turning into `` germany is russias buttboy '' again : they do n't have an issue with sanctions against russia , they have an issue with one specific sanction which is targeting nord stream 2 . 
  whatever you may think of it , it should be obvious why germany thinks it 's not the business of the us to meddle with it , in particular because the bill itself flat out says the us should look to export gas to the eu to '' * create american jobs * '' . 
  it 's not even just implied . 
  in short , they are pissed because they see it as the us using sanctions to further their own business interests , at the same time threatening unity of the west in regards to russia by acting unilaterally . 
  nord stream 2 has become a hugely divisive topic , and it sure feels like the us deliberately putting their finger into the wound . 
  they could n't have found a better way if they tried . 
  and how did `` hardcore sanctions '' work out in iran or cuba or north korea ? 
  our influence is very limited either way . 
  so far engaging with authoritarian states has a * much * higher success rate than issuing sanctions could ever dream off . 
  the only issue is ukraine and the line in the sand . 
  otherwise it 'd be a no-brainer . 
  i remember they even offered to connect poland and i think latvia to it , and we offered to share our emergency storage , but they were n't interested . 
  somehow that got lost in history . 
  the policy is unified , opinions are not . 
  we had different opinions , talked about it , came to an agreement . 
  regular fucking politics . 
  almost like talking to each other serves a purpose or something . 
  yes , your senate imposes sanctions your government does n't want and does n't even bother talking to anyone in europe about it , but it 's us that have an issue with unity . 
  sure sure . 
  it 's not us that 's dependent , we get about 25 % of our gas from russia compared to  80 % for many eastern european states . 
  renewables , lng terminals and reductions of energy consumptions are reducing it all the time . 
  want to try again ? 
  now i wonder if you actually thought bringing up ww2 would be a good point or if you just do n't know anything else about germany .
