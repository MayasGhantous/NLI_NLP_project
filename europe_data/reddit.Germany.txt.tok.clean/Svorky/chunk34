  we already started one of those `` migration partnership program '' things with them last year . 
  generally it 's the failed or failing states that will be much more of a problem . 
  japan as in `` ethnically pure '' country . 
  those are not the only two options . 
  besides , it 's not like is does n't export their ideology . 
  yeah , crumbling middle-eastern states have been great for us . 
  coffee and cigarettes . 
  then like a banana or something an hour into work . 
  buddy i know it 's late but i wrote two sentences , is it too much to expect you to read it till the end ? 
  a hung parliament just means that no party has a majority by itself . 
  in systems like spain that 's pretty much always the case anyway so nobody calls it that . 
  but in britain with their two huge parties and fptp it happens very rarely - 2010 was the first time in decades afaik , and then in 2015 the conservatives got the majority again . 
  basically there 'd be a need for a coalition now if this holds true . 
  call election 20 % ahead to `` strengthen position during brexit '' , end up with hung parliament . 
  cameron must have taught her the old shoot-yourself-in-the-face-gambit before leaving . 
  i mean it is a problem , it would obviously be incredibly helpful to monitor their whatsapp or whatever . 
  it 's just not doable in any reasonable way . 
   `` my preference is to go for this as an extraordinary measure for extraordinary threats , for high gravity criminal offences ** such as ** terrorism and there i am in favour of enabling the use of personal data , '' looking forward to it being used for bike theft a decade later . 
  it 's not because of the election , it 's because of the german g20 presidency - africa was one of the topics and so germany has become a kind of patron for this . 
  plus it ties into climate change , migration , trade etc. , so it makes sense from a `` selfish '' standpoint as well . 
  backing out of it after election would be a huge diplomatic blunder . 
  you do n't toy with foreign policy like that to score points in an election . 
  not that this would even score any significant amount of points anyway . 
  what even is this `` africa '' . 
  literacy rate ranges from like 95 to 20 percent . 
  there are enough countries that are in better shape than china was 40 years ago . 
  i have no idea where this idea that it was already full of well educated people with 100 % literacy rate came from . 
  it was at 70 % in the early 80s . 
  tunisia ( who joined this program ) is at 82 % today . 
  the basic principle of this is to not just shower them with money or give them more short-term aid , but to have it dependent on reforms , whose goal in turn will mostly be to increase private investment by reducing risks and improving business conditions . 
  basically to have 5 $ of state investment leverage 50 $ of private investment . 
  that 's really the only way to get to the numbers required to make a difference . 
  the theory is perfectly solid , the problem will implementation . 
  are there any non-terrorists to side with ? 
  eh , it started basically just to help with coordination and monitoring and is now somewhere in the middle between that and a proper border guard . 
  legally they have a lot of the requirements now : they can intervene in member states that do n't do their job properly without having to be asked , they can deport people and can coordinate with other countries ( such as training the libyan coast guard ) . 
  none of that was possible when the crisis started . 
  but that was mostly introduced only last year , so in practice they 're still pretty far off . 
  their budget has ~ tripled since 2015 and employees are supposed to double until 2020 . 
  they 're still very much in the setup phase . 
  [ frontex ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/ ) has been growing quickly since the refugee crisis . 
  those are very different kind of predictions . 
  a gdp forecast for a quarter requires you to guess a hundred different variables and what exactly will happen at what moment in time . 
  and then if consumers spend more than you thought , or the pound falls a bit more , or the global economy does a bit better , or the central bank changes policies - you 're fucked . 
  this is a conditional forecast . 
  it tells you the effect of brexit , not the exact change of gdp next quarter . 
  basically : if everything stays exactly the same but we change x , then y will happen . 
  not that trade models are super accurate , that 's why predictions still differ so much . 
  but the general effect is well known : brexit will lead to less trade . 
  and less trade means lower gdp . 
  still with this two years later huh ? 
  i thought maybe people got around to reading it by now . 
  it allows for any member country to temporarily suspend it . 
  here 's a tip : mdma , amphetamines , shrooms , lsd and others are largely produced in europe . 
  it 's really mostly cocaine , heroin and sometimes weed that 's problematic in terms of overseas drug cartels . 
  so skip those and buy european i guess . 
  it 's what macron wants us to do . 
  to be fair no one can resist 90s trash , it is the pinnacle of western culture . 
  what even is this ? 
  the university of nottingham spent half a billion euro lobbying the eu with 200 full time lobbyists in one year ? 
  i 'd assume their database is fucked and that 's just their annual revenue or something . 
  you know the great thing about discussions is that you can ask your partner for their opinions instead of just making them up . 
  it 's not as easy to feel smug then though , i get it . 
  you could have just phoned someone in italy and asked them , the situation was no different . 
  so really absolutely everybody could have predicted it . 
  in any case nobody is happy with that , but the only solution is a eu-wide asylum system . 
  and i 'm sorry , while there can absolutely be provisions and actually to me ideally eastern europe would take very few or nobody - you do not get so sit it out completely . 
  oh i thought i was talking to an adult , my bad . 
  let me explain a little slower then . 
  being above 60 % debt-to-gdp ratio is not enough to be in breach of the treaty . 
  instead a path gets calculated for you to reach < 60 % again . 
  it 's broadly a reduction by 1/20th every year , starting after the reforms of 2011 . 
  for us , that would currently be ~ 73 % , while we 're actually at 68 % and declining . 
  therefore , we are fully compliant with stability and growth pact . 
  that means we 're doing super duper . 
  if you need more help , feel free to ask but otherwise the [ european commission ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination_en ) has all the info you should need . 
  dude it 's okay to lose an argument every once in a while , no need to pretend you did n't understand . 
   even if the target can not be achieved due to the specific conditions , the ratio must have sufficiently diminished and ** must be approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace ** we plan to reach it by ~ 2020-2023 . 
  get my point about you guys not understanding treaties ? 
  are you going to complain the country that gets shat on every day for their obsession with austerity does n't take debt seriously enough ? 
  alright . 
  anyway we 're about ~ 5 years away from reaching it again , thank you for your concern . 
  they said however that the eu has the obligation to build a european wide asylum system and the right to decide which country is responsible for which application . 
  and it 's not even in legalese , it 's laid out very clearly . 
  ~ 11 billion of that 20b number is spent * outside * of germany , trying to reduce the flow . 
  and that 's not nearly all we spent on those kind of efforts . 
  complain about someone else . 
  thank you for proving my point . 
  that may be somewhat of an excuse for the brits , but you joined in * 2004 * . 
  nobody with even passing knowledge of the eu could have thought of it as a purely economic union by then . 
  then they should have behaved like adults and not signed them . 
  or as the second best option , leave now so the rest of us can get on with it . 
  more like `` eastern europe absolutely does not understand treaties '' . 
  in first world countries , courts try to make their judgement independent of politics or status as `` ally '' . 
  sorry for the inconvenience . 
  man i miss the times when these people stayed in their basement . 
  stupid internet . 
  you can add [ this one too ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/871328428963901440 ) , that has been making the rounds as well . 
  [ actual context ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/04/trump-berates-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-terror-attacks ) is him saying there 's going to be extra ( armed ) police in the street , and not to be alarmed by those . 
  i do n't think anyone has argued to straight up swap the us for china .
