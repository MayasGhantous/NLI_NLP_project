  they 've argued that our geopolitical interests align less with the us than they used to - doubly so under trump - and if we move away slightly from the us , then aspiring to find some closer ties to asia makes sense . 
  or in short , it 's a realignment from : us-eu ------- china to us -- eu ------ china that people are arguing for . 
  what are you critiquing ? 
  he wrote an entire article about islamic terrorism , sourced by a leading expert in the field . 
  but that does n't count because he worded the title in a way you do n't like ? 
  it 's a perfectly fine title , the word jihad at the end makes it very clear who he is talking about . 
  i would posit that going by this thread , the elephant in the room is that these people are indeed `` young europeans '' . 
  but saying so is apparently not politically correct , seeing the amount of triggering it did . 
  yes , the `` expert on islamic terrorism '' is afraid of mentioning islam . 
  got him . 
  surely you know what a figure of speech is . 
  nobody that says this ever actually moves . 
  in fact half of eastern europe keeps moving here . 
  people are rational like that . 
  european leadership round 2 - this time with 100 % more diplomacy . 
  exiting times . 
  oh i agree , that would have been much easier . 
  but we 're still making the progress we 're supposed to make . 
  we 've already met the [ europe 2020 goal of reducing emissions by 20 % compared to 1990 ] ( http://imgur.com/dj9on9y ) anyway , and there are eu countries that have not . 
  so germany is a bit of a weird target . 
  so your plan is to shut down manufacturing to reduce emissions then or what am i supposed to take away from this ? 
  we 're on track to reach our goals . 
  industry my dude . 
  look up [ emission intensity/emissions per gdp unit . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_carbon_intensity ), 
  huh , really ? 
  i mean i would n't know , i just get it from those oecd reports , [ like this one . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/qigkfyi ) do n't know how accurate those are . 
  italy has not been as responsive . 
  greece has indeed , but there 's nothing ordinary about greece . 
  portugal is ranked as one of the eu countries most responsive to reform demands/suggestions after the crisis . 
  like spain and ireland , and unlike italy . 
  those were also pushed by germany , that part always gets left out . 
  still , i like costa and i 'm glad it 's working out for the portuguese . 
  yeah , for these ( cheap ) supermarkets it 's 90 % about a perfectly running supply chain and it takes time to set it up with local companies . 
  but they should win out eventually . 
  in theory . 
  a fun fact about frankfurt is also that by train it 's ~ 4 hours away from : hamburg , berlin , munich , paris and brussels . 
  stuttgart and cologne are ~ 1.5 hours away . 
  i actually know quite a few people who work in hamburg but commute there once a week . 
  so backwater is a bit harsh , ca n't get more central than that . 
  sure , i agree . 
  but this is the best we got , and if it works we 're at about 2 \u00b0 less than we would be without any kind of attempt . 
  which is not enough but still significant and will save many many lives . 
  the climate also does n't care if the reduction by 2030 compared to doing nothing comes from slower gains in india or a bigger reduction in the west . 
  treating these nations differently , logically is the only thing that made a deal possible in the first place . 
  having the west - the one that achieved it 's wealth by not having to care about emissions - make virtually no sacrifices while telling india they have to stop growing their economy now please and keep living in poverty is for obvious reasons not going to work . 
  so countries set realistic goals , achievable without fucking up their economies . 
  those will naturally differ for countries in different parts of their development . 
  they are not , that would absurdly ambitious especially for india . 
  china is close to their peak but india is pretty far off . 
  not possible . 
  paris goals are usually measured as reduction of emissions * compared to doing nothing * , or as emission intensity of gdp . 
  china agreed to pull their peak forward to 2030 , which would mean a 15 % reduction compared to the business-as-usual-scenario and a ~ 60 % reduction of emission intensity compared to 2005 . 
  but they are currently on track to significantly overachieve . 
  ( personally i like www.climateactiontracker.org for a quick overview because they have pretty pictures . ), 
  did you also say bush is n't going to be president forever when the us failed to ratify kyoto ? 
  i wish it was just trump . 
  no , since speed of reduction matters are great deal . 
  so they are wrong again . 
  you do n't hear about it because it 's mostly not the result of any policies but market forces - mostly cheap gas . 
  emissions in the us are going to decrease naturally ( [ unless trump manages to stop even that ] ( http://imgur.com/pin5wg4 ) ) , paris was about speeding up the process . 
  they are , but china also agreed to ratify paris in a joint statement with the us , after close negotiations with obama . 
  that was one of his big accomplishments . 
  the eu was always going to stick with it , it mirrors our own goals anyway . 
  the issue is that other countries like russia , canada , india and such might pull out too now that it does n't mean going against the entire international community any longer . 
  i feel it 's mostly going to depend on getting china to stick with it . 
  it needs to be done in close cooperation with them . 
  otherwise there 's not much we can do . 
  it 's complicated . 
  per pupil we spent about as much as expected ( meaning similar amount as netherlands , finland etc. 
  ) , but we spend too little of it on infrastructure . 
  a big issue is that education is a bit of mess responsibility-wise . 
  like teachers get paid on the state level , but buildings are owned on the communal level . 
  those differ * a lot * in wealth and have least money where schools would probably need it the most . 
  and now the federal state has some money to spare and wants to invest in those schools , but our constitution does not allow them to interfere much because it 's a state responsibility , so instead the schools can only build `` digital classrooms '' with it instead of fixing the plumbing or whatever is needed . 
  actually saudi-arabia recently said they wo n't ask for weapons anymore . 
  there were a lot of issues with spare parts and munition not being approved or taking very long to approve , because of how politically difficult it became . 
  a big role in that had a certain fella named sigmar gabriel - now foreign minister - who has been openly opposed to selling weapons to them . 
  we negotiated an fta with them for like 6 years before it stalled at the final stages and have now picked up discussions again . 
  the other countries you mentioned , apart from australia , have n't even started or are at very preliminary stages . 
  so i hope they are interested , otherwise that 's a bit of a dick move . 
  i mean , this just says `` both sides ' gdp would grow '' , that was n't really in doubt ? 
  it 's more about india wanting easy work-visas for their it sector and the eu wanting the tariffs on cars gone + access to government procurement that 's making it difficult , as far as i understand it . 
  2 of the 11 directors seem to be german . 
  he very very rarely attends these events , and only gives interviews if they 're about his research work rather than about merkel or politics . 
  [ here 's a picture . 
  i hope someone explains to him that companies that define the modern us like facebook , microsoft , google or apple barely show up in those stupid trade balances , and just how much the eu can screw with those if they choose to . 
  or that bmws sold in the us are rarely build in germany anyway . 
  bring it . 
  yeah , for some reason the uk almost always gets beat by the rest of the eu in the first quarter , which then turn around again in the next . 
  the fact that this is partly caused by a continued slowdown of domestic consumption is worrying , but the 2nd quarter will be the interesting one . 
  or it went from 0.349 to 0.15 . 
  no point in that guessing game . 
  as a note : this is calculated by dividing the total hours worked by number of workers , and includes part-time employment . 
  that largely explains the difference between germany and greece . 
  in greece only about 8 % work under 30 hours , while in germany it 's at almost 20 % . 
  ~ ~ [ here 's the data for full time employees ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do ) . ~ ~ link broke , all this data is from the [ eu labour force survey though . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/labour_market_and_labour_force_survey_\\ ( lfs \\ ) _ statistics ) it 's 44.6 h/week ( ~ 2230h/year ) in greece and 41.3 h/week ( ~ 2065h/year ) in germany . 
  so we do work less , but more like half an hour a day .
