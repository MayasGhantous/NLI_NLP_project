  best we can hope for is dealing with the problems once they become too big to ignore . 
  i also disagree that they 're just about `` calming the public '' , but i know i 'll never convince you there . 
  since summer last year , the german government has thrown all it 's weight behind the reform of the european asylum system , has passed two reform packages of the german asylum law and will pass more , tightening them each time . 
  you can of course disagree with all those laws but it 's pretty clear that they are not at all happy with the current situation and * are * doing something about it . 
  in fact i 'd say merkel is much more positive in her words than in her actions , and it 's her actions that people are missing . 
  she shifted her approach a year ago . 
  more by the `` landflucht '' / re-urbanization . 
  we have millions of empty apartments/houses , just not in the cities that need them . 
  yes . 
  they 'll also use paper for it just like the nazis did . 
  we do , but the parents live here anyway . 
  he was born in germany . 
  we are not the borg you know , different germans express themselves in different ways . 
  the child got asylum , not the family of six . 
  it 's right in the title . 
  i actually meant no offense . 
  politics and especially election are just way more personal and dramatic in the us , it 's a fact . 
  by comparison they 're quite boring here and i like it that way . 
   right , the us and other occupying powers first fired , imprisoned or executed anyone that would disagree with them . 
  ... are you actually serious ? 
  so what about that little old communist party that was part of the council ? 
  slipped through the cracks ? 
  it is a very inconspicuous name to be fair . 
  you did what now ? 
  do you mean our constitution ? 
  [ here 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parlamentarischer_rat ) how that was created . 
  it 's a bad point and it has no place in politics . 
  if she wants to criticize her for a lack of a long-term plan , she should do just that and keep the petty personal stuff out of it . 
  we 're not the us . 
  apparently everything was going just peachy until september 2015 in peoples memories . 
  thank you , much better . 
  not one mention of `` anti-vaccine sentiment '' ( because the study does n't allow that conclusion and they know it ) , and this part also seems kinda important :  the findings show that many countries ( particularly france , bosnia & herzegovina , japan , iran , mongolia and vietnam ) , display much greater confidence in the importance of vaccines than in their safety . 
  this suggests that people do not necessarily dismiss the value of vaccination even if they have doubts about how safe vaccines are . 
   so even uneducated peasants in the developing world understand immunology better than french elites . 
  alrighty then . 
  anyway i hate articles about studies that do n't include the questions asked , and here the link to the study is broken too . 
  in any case it seems odd to me to not follow it up with something simple like : `` are you willing to get vaccinated ? '', 
  because they * can * absolutely be unsafe , and that belief alone to me is n't enough to describe this as the `` french anti-vaccine sentiment '' . 
  pity the results of the question about effectiveness was n't included either . 
  it 's really imprecisely written altogether . 
  where exactly is it gaining traction ? 
  please tell . 
  headline : a ** commentary ** by sebastian fischer . 
  there is no expectation of neutrality or objectivity in a commentary . 
  it 's the opposite , subjectivity is the defining feature of it . 
  you might not agree with his particular bias , but that does n't equate to some ethical issue with the paper . 
  breitbart is though . 
  more importantly also crap . 
  sure , but spiegel wrote about all of that extensively , so where 's the issue ? 
  there were probably about a dozen articles about it all in all . 
  are they just supposed to pat them on the back and say `` well done '' or something ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  it 's not like breitbart are going to have investigative reporters all over europe . 
  they 'll aggregate a `` certain type '' of news that the real guys have already reported and give it their own spin so it 's nice and hateful . 
  apart from the always popular `` making stuff up '' category , that 's all they can do . 
  and what afd accomplishments exactly would you like them to write about ? 
  they are n't part of any state governments , they are n't in the national parliament . 
  they have n't really done much of anything . 
  if it makes you feel better . 
  the european court of human rights ( and our own courts ) stopped us from sending people back to greece in ** 2011 ** . 
  so we did . 
  now the situation looks to be improving , and we might be legally fine in sending people back . 
  so we will . 
  it 's not complicated . 
  it 's a broken system that stopped mattering long ago , but we have followed and will follow it as long as it exists . 
  but because it 's broken , the numbers we 'd be able to push back to greece simply do not matter , at all . 
  this is n't flip-flopping . 
  makes a nice headline i suppose , but that 's just about it . 
  i 'd rather be * a little * more nuanced , thanks . 
  i 'm sorry , merkel was told - screamed at really - to uphold the dublin regulation all the damn time on here . 
  that 's all this is . 
  is just everything we do wrong by default now ? 
  not to mention that we 're talking about a couple thousand people - hundreds of whom would actually be send back - so this is not `` dumping the problem on greece '' and really not a big story at all . 
  she 's also not saying everything will stay the same . 
  that 's just the headline , not a quote . 
  she 's not saying anything to the contrary . 
  the 14 words do n't have anything to do with the ( historic ) nazis , so he did no such thing . 
  there , nuance . 
  for 100.000 $ i 'd move away too and i 'm a pretty non-turkish german . 
  article 42 , paragraph 7 :  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
  only applicable for defensive wars , of course . 
  and there 's a bit of a loophole so ireland for example is n't forced to suddenly take military action , but it still makes the eu also a military pact and means there 's a foundation already that could be expanded . 
  the vote for afd was mainly about the refugee crisis , but these are still state elections . 
  for example : as shown the cdu lost 5 % between the state elections in 06 and '11 which was their worst result ever until sunday . 
  but at the same time in the national elections they gained 9 % ( 33 -  42 ) in meck-pomm from '09 to ' 13 . 
  little weird to put all the national politicians below the results of a state election . 
  nationally , spd for example is polling a good 10 % below what they got on sunday . 
  fine , let 's go over it :  she just imported a million `` better voters '' they do n't have citizenship . 
  so she exchanged actual votes of current germans for the theoretical vote of people without the right to cast them ? 
   10 % of germany 's population if you think long term yeah we have 82 million people here , not getting dragged into that `` argument '' . 
   it does n't matter if germans do n't approve of her now makes perfect sense in a democracy that 's going to have elections next year . 
   `` new germans '' will approve of her and her party 10 years from now says who ? 
  germans with migratory background are more likely to vote spd than `` ethnic '' germans . 
  she 's the leader of the * christian * conservative party , that 's historically been strict on immigration . 
  still is compared to the rest of the established parties . 
   you think syrians/eritreans will ever vote for any afd-like party ? 
  oh my god i found a sentence that 's true . 
  of course your argument is that she needed these new voters to counteract the votes for afd , that they only get in the first place because of the refugee crisis , but let 's not mention that . 
   this is all part of a long-term strategy .
