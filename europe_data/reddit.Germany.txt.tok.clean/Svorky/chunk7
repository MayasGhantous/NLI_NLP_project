   the fact that isis is using people pretending to be refugees is a political trap . 
  we are smart enough as a society not to fall into that trap haha . 
  interesting interview though . 
  thanks . 
  * still * with the speculation , huh ? 
  i thought maybe some people would stop it for like a day or two . 
  i mean , what 'd that be ? 
  it 's a lot , but not impossible . 
  job on the side a couple months , sell some stuff and there you go . 
  if he really was `` obsessed '' he was likely thinking about this for a while . 
  as for getting it : not that difficult if you grow up in a not-so-nice part of a big city . 
  or i guess there 's always the internet , but i do n't know how easy that really is . 
  he never lived there in the first place , as far as i know . 
  here i go what ? 
  my statement was independent of whatever the motive turns out to be . 
  you are a trash person . 
  gloat some more though , very becoming . 
  not that i know of , no . 
  i 'd guess he either looked `` southern '' to them so they assumed he was turkish because that 's the biggest group in germany , or - like many here - for whatever legit or not legit reason assumed it has to be a muslim so they went with `` turk '' . 
  ca n't think of another explanation . 
  nothing specifically about turks . 
  been to croatia and greece . 
  had a lovely time in both . 
  yes , and every else it 's higher . 
  in germany it 's 0.9 / 100.000 for a total of 719 . 
  so for it to rise by even 0.1 it would take ~ 80 murders . 
  the average of the balkans is  1.0, 
  he said he 's from a `` hartz 4 gegend '' . 
  hartz 4 refers to unemployment benefits , so he 's basically saying he 's from a poor neighborhood in munich . 
  the part with station\u00e4re behandlung he says right after . 
  actually no . 
  we 'd need hundreds of people being killed in terrorist attacks every year in germany reach the murder rate of the balkans . 
  to not even speak of the rest of the crime rate . 
  but i really do n't see the point in these type of dick measuring contests . 
  i find them quite tasteless tbh so i 'm going to stop and will wish your country well instead . 
  being admitted to some type of hospital for several days , basically . 
  in this context it would make sense for him to refer to a psychiatry , but obviously i ca n't know that . 
  some guy screaming at a shooter , calling him a piece of shit and whatnot . 
  ca n't really understand the shooter , but i * think * i could make out `` stop fliming '' , `` fucking turks '' and `` i 'm was born here '' . 
  `` i was in stationary care '' `` i did n't do anything '' , `` because of you i had to buy a weapon '' not 100 % sure though . 
  tbh i have no idea what 's going on there . 
  not literally , no . 
  pretending to have some decency ? 
  maybe wait like one hour or so before you start peddling your agenda and throwing buzzwords around . 
  none . 
  has to have a political motive . 
  police have reported `` several dead '' according to sueddeutsche . 
  they 're also assuming a single person is behind it . 
  that 's all that 's really known so far . 
  well , it has n't . 
  to be a bit more accurate : there 's around 1.4 m eligible voters in germany . 
  570.000 of those voted , and 60 % = 340.000 of those voted akp . 
  it 's quite odd , as most german-turks vote spd ( left ) in german elections . 
  well , people can move . 
  it 's about their nationality , not heritage . 
  and i 'd guess the entire world combined does n't have the capacity to dna test that many people . 
  that 's fine , as i said we all make mistakes . 
  nothing wrong with just admitting it and moving on . 
  i 'm not obsessed . 
  in the normal world saying that a group of people is born with a preference for violence is textbook racism . 
  wow , smooth switch in argument there buddy . 
  call me a retard some more , we might get somewhere . 
  if you know he corrected himself , why are you still arguing his point . 
  i have no problem with it , i never said i did , i had a problem with what he originally wrote . 
  you clearly understand the difference now , so what the fuck are you even doing . 
  so how often do you think i have to explain that `` innate '' means `` born with '' , and how that is entirely different from making a statement about `` regional and cultural difficulties '' ? 
  it 's one sentence , it should n't be this hard for you . 
  for fucks sake ... 
  no you . 
  he said : `` these are deeper innate traits of these people that ** some ** would be willing to do such things . '', 
  if you 'd pay attention to the word ** some ** , you 'd recognize that me made a statement about the entire group , not just the crazy ones . 
  and he argued , before editing , that this was something `` these people '' are born with . 
  i 'd like to apologize for correctly reading what he said and not assuming he neither meant `` innate '' nor `` some '' . 
  oh is that why you edited it then , because it 's just semantics ? 
  it 's the literal meaning of the word . 
  it 's alright if you made a mistake , it happens . 
  do n't blame me for it though . 
  that 's small . 
  innate = born with . 
  get a dictionary . 
   deeper innate traits of these people kinda refreshing to see 100 % textbook racism rather than the beating around the bush and using of code-words that 's all the rage nowadays . 
  haha i see this sub is up to it 's old tricks again , that did n't last long . 
  i 'd like to thank britain for pushing out these idiots for a bit by boring them with brexit . 
  reddit as a whole is filtering information for you . 
  that 's all this site is , plus a community awkwardly glued on top . 
  huh , genuinely surprised . 
  in that case , more power to you . 
  definitely , the type and purpose of the jokes usually changes though . 
  but i really did n't want to get into an actual argument . 
  super sunny here , so it 's park time for me . 
  nah it 's okay , pushing boundaries is healthy behavior during puberty . 
  just annoying . 
  i suppose at some point you might grow up , fingers crossed . 
  seriously dude ? 
  stop . 
  far-right meme . 
  originally a battle-cry from the crusades . 
  uh , it does actually make them less dangerous than people with the same ideology in properly organized groups though . 
  serious question , what 's even the idea behind the trump-trend of putting random adjectives in front of politicians names ? 
  it makes you sound like a child .
