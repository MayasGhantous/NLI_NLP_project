african marshall plan would n't you agree though that the term is ridiculous by itself ? 
  i remember the first time i saw this man . 
  i thought he was an actor making fun of london 's mayor . 
  nope . 
  damn, 
  well , at least they 're not pretending to be neutral, 
  siebzehntes bundesland never been there , never will, 
  impossible though i suppose , if not on this or a related sub , then where ? 
  r/history maybe, 
  i 'm failing to see how sch\u00e4uble has even remotely come close to bismarck 's achievements ; i 'm not trying to blame sch\u00e4uble or glorify bismarck here . 
  the way i see it , sch\u00e4uble has been very succesful to stay alive politically and little else . 
  i do n't * like * bismarck , no sane person should , in my opinion . 
  i acknowledge his immense success though , obviously . 
   these plans have been brewing for a long time . 
  could you give me examples ? 
  i 'm legit interested in that . 
  it does n't seem realistic though . 
  sch\u00e4uble is quite infamous for his pre-election rhetoric , let 's not forget . 
  i was n't aware of the g20 aspect , thanks for that insight . 
  still , i do n't see how this is anything else than sch\u00e4uble engaging in namedropping ( or whatever you 'd call it in this context ) . 
  an anti-feel-good-fairy-tale comment in my r/europe ? 
  gtfo, 
  as for the reason why : no . 
  germany was ** rebuilt ** . 
  emphasis on * re - * . 
  pre-1914 germany was already well capable of achieving growht similar to the frg after ww2 . 
  the geopolitical climate of the cold war favored such development . 
   how much is germany planning increase by to make it a marshall plan ? 
  not at all . 
  ~ ~ this nonsense will be dropped after the election . ~ ~ edit : i was made aware that this is not necessarily related to the election campaign . 
  i ca n't see how this is anything more than self-gratifying talk by s ~ ~ c ~ ~ h ~ ~ \u00e4 ~ ~ auble . 
  the difference between the situation in post-war germany and most african countries in their current states could n't be more larger , and he 's well aware of that . 
  let 's not forget we 've got an election coming . 
  jeez i hate that guy . 
  lol , he 'd like that . 
  ~ ~ sch\u00e4uble can eat my a # $ . ~ ~ i find myself disagreeing with him a lot . 
  yes , that we do . 
  we 're generally not known to pick sides in the middle east , for what it 's worth . 
  i doubt we 'll raise the flag for either side in this case . 
  i do n't trust that map supplied here . 
  i mean , #teamqatar / #teamsaudi ? 
  just silly . 
  i 'll have to agree with the u/buttmaybee . 
  besides you 're ignoring that said 3000 years of western philosophy are ` rich ' in their criticism of politics and politicians . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're being sarcastic tbh . 
  i do n't know what the source of said map is ; i was never under the impression that we ( germany ) took any clear sides in this or most other conflicts ( post-1945 obviously ) . 
  same in this issue . 
  germany is traditionally more lenient when it comes to dealing with russia , iran , etc. . you 're not supposed to be happy at all , if that makes sense . 
  whatever side we choose , ethics will not be a deciding factor . 
  as an iranian-german i have no problem saying that the islamic republic of iran ( and therefore , in this case , qatar ) , as much as this attack saddens me , is in any way morally superior to the despicable gulf arabs . 
  qatar , to my best knowledge , is not ` more horrible ' than the ksa . 
  they 're just both shitty ass countries with a shitty ass elite . 
  as in the arabic word for ` girl ' ? 
  germany also supplies arms to ksa, 
  imagining god , sitting in front of the tv , with his wife beaters on and drunk on cheap beer *  emergency phone rings * *  throws half empty beer can at emergency phone * *  phone keeps ringing *, 
  well then at least it will take this topic from the table entirely , as far as using it as a way of showing dissent goes . 
  quite a stretch , do n't you think ? 
   it 's a pretty common theme with revolutions and their aftermath . 
  yes , this is so true . 
   if you leave the golf club you will lose your membership rights . 
  agreed , this is essentially what i 'm saying . 
  however there 's been talk of ' a mutually beneficial agreement for all ' from all sides , which pretty much was empty talk and raised unrealistic expectations for some . 
  relative to those expectations , the negotiations and resulting deal will be ugly and , at least from the uk side , perceived as punishment - in part due to the expectations . 
  this is all a long way from the official ` friendship ' / ` brotherhood ' that the eu tried to instill in its citizens . 
  that 's what i said bruv . 
  you leave the eu . 
  i said * european decisionmakers * , that 's pretty much synonymous to * decisionmakers of the eu * . 
  yes , but bear in mind this is purely business ( godfather lol ) . 
  personal sentiments of the politicians do n't really matter here . 
  the punishing serves the pragmatic purpose of deterring likeminded . 
  the eu , i assume , will use all legal means to achieve this . 
  morally speaking , this shows that above all the eu is pragmatic . 
  it 's going to be a very disgusting divorce , let me tell you that . 
  it has to be ; the european decision makers are looking to deter any other members that are thinking about leaving . 
  the only way this could be somewhat civil is if the eu sees a realistic chance that a future uk government would decide to rejoin the ~ ~ reich ~ ~ union . 
  my thoughts on this . 
  i 'm very sad the uk decided to leave . 
  uhuh sounds like some ** prime bs ** amirite mes amis ? 
  guys ? 
  yes , people forget that the founding fathers themselves had some serious and very profound ` disagreements ', 
  speak for yourself , swedecuck ** something something patriot something something brick **, 
  ouch . . that 's ... ouch, 
  they 're going to regret this . 
  most of the young returners in turkey are unhappy . 
  i do n't know where you live , but it 's pretty obvious that you have hav little or no contact to kurds . 
  i 'm not going to defend the obviously unfair and possibly illegal behaviour of the akp leading up to and during the election , but if you honestly think that every single kurdish yes-voter was forced into doing so at the ballot box maybe you should consider to stop talking about these issues and listen a little . 
  i see your point , but fighting isis is worlds away from fighting against the established military of even one other nation . 
  with half the country becoming increasingl apathetic to anyone or anything , turkey probably could n't even properly defend itself right now . 
  so if turkey were to attack bulgaria , they 'd be free for taking by anyone that feels overly annoyed by erdogan . 
  and boy is that dude lonely right now . 
  he messed up good in the past months . 
  i 'm terribly uninformed regarding the french elections . 
  emotionally i was so heavily invested in th turkish shitshow , i forgot about my neighbours ; _ ; i hope this wo n't be another disappointment, 
  similar to the turks in europe , being so far removed from their homes gives them both an unrealistic estimate of the situation , as well as in many individuals a kind of cultural insecurity , an identity crisis as some call it . 
  by becoming overly nationalistic they hope to have something to hold on to , which really leads to them being overly zealous . 
  this zeal expresses itself in an unwillingness to compromise in cultural and political questions , therefore any notion of turkish dominance or even coexistance in turkey ( as trivial as it may be ) is perceived as an attack on their identity . 
  this is all made worse by the fact that many of them speak turkish as their first language , which aggravates their inherent inferiority complex - this of course leads to even more radical sentiments . 
  i refer to anything that goes beyond wanting autonomy for the kurds in turkey/its neighbours or establishing an independent kurdish state . 
  while nationalistic , these views are still somewhat sensible . 
  i am talking about those people that openly ( not in front of actual europeans though ) demand to establish a greater kurdistan that occupies huge areas of currently non-kurdish land .
