  i do n't think that will be much of an advantage in the future if the free trade agreements with canada and the usa respectively go through . 
  the eu already has a free trade agreement with mexico , so all nafta states are accessible . 
  indeed i read that if all agreements go through , a new agreement encompassing nafta states and the eu should be negotiated for even further integration . 
  a more interesting region for enhanced cooperation or integration would be north africa or south america . 
  the former because of physical proximity and the latter because of traditional european ties . 
  indeed if canada joined us it would be great . 
  though current rules state that members must be european . 
  but what would be the benefits to canada anyway ? 
  i hope he gets it . 
  i mean , as opposed to obama he actually prevented a war ... edit : oh yeah , i really hit the spot this time . 
  can you explain what the deal is with this debt ceiling ? 
   in a country where the capital is the city with the [ highest standard of living ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercer_quality_of_living_survey ) in the world for the last 3 years . 
  unemployment is the [ lowest in the eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_unemployment_rate ) .

  and i am just sitting here thinking i need to learn some scandinavian language . 
  hooray !, 
  wait , wait , one more thing . 
  how good are your women looking ? 
   regarding online company registration and electronic signature - is there a non-third world country without something like this ? 
  til i live in a third-world country . 
  those countries have such a sad story . 
  seeing them united in the eu could be very beautiful . 
  do n't know yet , one of the next 16 . 
  i love it that we have at least one informed moldovan around here . 
  great to see that some cities have the sense to manage lighting . 
  people massively undervalue the quality of lighting . 
  the oil rigs are really visible between scandinavia and britain . 
  strange that they show only the eu countries on the map for the single market and not all the eea members . 
  well , half of poland has been germany until '45 and the divide is still visible today . 
  moldovan wine it is then !, 
  i 'd like to extend this request to any european equivalent of any of the major subreddits . 
  it is really irritating to see any discussion with the unspoken assumption of taking place in the usa . 
  edit : or any story gets an us american spin . 
  [ case in point ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1mxcgv/in_central_mexico_its_allout_war_in_the_streets/ccdm4wt ) . 
  oh my , that is really mean . 
   i believe they are # 2 in the world in per capita production of supermodels ( behind estonia ) . 
  seriously ? 
  not that i would be entirely surprised . 
  today later , sorry . 
  we are done with all the nordic countries . 
  are my intentions that transparent ? 
  now that would be an interesting question to discuss here : would you want the european microstates ( andorra , monaco , san marino , liechtenstein , vatican city ) be integrated to the eu and if yes , how ? 
  maybe she wants to promote use of german internationally . 
  try some series format that encourages interaction in the comments . 
  the success of the `` what do you know about ... '' series is that though people post facts in the top level comments , everybody else can discuss their stories and anecdotes surrounding the country . 
  you could for example do a similar series to the `` what do you know about ... '' about historical persons , events , traditions ... now that i write that down i kinda want to do it myself . 
   great pressure from the us fuck them . 
  consequences of increasing urbanisation and declining population . 
  when we have done all fifty states the series is over and maybe i will do something else . 
  i always hated that saying . 
  if you do something , do it for yourself . 
  expecting gratefulness is just selfish . 
  i appreciate the people thanking me . 
  i ca n't believe we still have 16 countries left . 
  ah , prediction markets . 
  one of the most beautiful ideas i have seen . 
  frighteningly accurate tools to retrieve quite detailed information . 
  sadly such markets are under heavy threats of regulation and could suffer from some biases due to limited liquidity . 
  thank you very much for the link though . 
  nope , adoption in germany is even slower than in the us . 
  another thing is that i spend almost nothing except basic needs like electricity , rent ... 
  i bought some humble bundle games though , so i could say i used bitcoin . 
  / r/bitcoinde discusses bitcoin in germany but is a really small community . 
  how much do you know about bitcoin already ? 
  i am interested in it as a nation-less currency available worldwide for near-instant wealth transfer . 
  + / u/bitcointip 0.10 eur verify, 
  when the piratenpartei was founded i hoped for them to take a classically liberal course but that fell through . 
  i see much potential for the afd to become an actual free democratic party . 
  i am not sure i understand . 
  do you find it strange that i am intellectually able to see what is better for the eu from a more objective viewpoint ? 
  fuck russia , welcome ukraine . 
  what stuff can i buy from the ukraine to signal my support ? 
  another one : their program is quite small now compared to the larger parties . 
  what kind of things are in the works , that is what could a voter expect from them in the future ? 
  i have never in my life used any recreational drug except alcohol and coffee . 
  people fail to see a distinction between drug * use * and drug * abuse * . 
  the former is a pastime that people should be free to do however they like , the latter is a medical problem and should be dealt with accordingly . 
  treatment options are in place for nicotine and alcohol addiction , similar venues would then be opened for other substances . 
  and what could be really attractive in a recession like this : legal ownership , production and sale provides tax revenue , jobs and brings tourism . 
  it reduces crime by virtue of lowering the number of criminal offenses possible , draws money away from criminal organisations , saves on policing costs such as jail/prison ... 
  did they announce any coalition plans ? 
   citizens  voters anyhow , the point still stands . 
  germans have the largest vote . 
  there are two aspects to this : 1 . 
  an eu citizen ca n't vote at his place of residence in national elections if it is not his birth country . 
  ( oversimplification ) we can look to federations such as germany or the usa to see how they solve that problem . 
  germany carries such an overwhelming voting weight that the german vote counts effectively more than most other votes . 
  this is the problem of having 84m citizens , the most in the union . 
  solutions are breaking up germany into smaller units , more comparable to smaller states , or representing the * bundesl\u00e4nder * directly in the eu and have the german federal government as kind of a local management structure , greatly reducing german voting power . 
  a similar approach can be applied to uk , france , spain and italy . 
  anyhow , i urge anyone thinking about eu reform to take a look at the constitutions of actual federations such as germany , austria , belgium , usa , switzerland . 
  my assumption is that the polling usually asks people spread systematically over all strata of society . 
  if voting behavior is highly variant between groups this method could undersample voting . 
  anyhow , all speculation is futile as there is no course of action i could take until sunday to profit from it in any way . 
  i know . 
  here are two proposals i think are worth discussing : 1 . 
  it should be possible to become professor through a promotion system , e.g. 
  ta -  doctoral student -  assistant professor -  ... -  full professor .
