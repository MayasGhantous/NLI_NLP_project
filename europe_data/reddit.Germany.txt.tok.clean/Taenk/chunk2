  how time flies . 
  * i like that you write both french and english . 
  go on !, 
  have also a look at the selection of [ european subreddits ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2egelh/a_noncomprehensive_list_of_european_equivalents/ ) we have . 
  i do n't know where you get the patience to explain this over and over . 
  i 'd like that explanation too . 
  especially since it 's bothering me by an unreasonable amount . 
  denmark and netherlands have overseas thingies too . 
  author of the list here . 
  there has been increased activity in / r/eupersonalfinance . 
  in all linked subs there has been a spike in new memberships . 
  as for how this translates into contributions , no idea . 
  it most certainly is more relevant . 
  the eu can give out stipends and by common market laws citizens have access to financial services from other countries . 
  but i ca n't take advantage of any of the us services . 
  interesting that you see more of a north-south divide in germany than the usual east-west divide . 
  i 'd be glad to try it . 
  you can still read ~ ~ / r/fuckcomcast ~ ~ / r/technology . 
  i do n't know . 
  fixed . 
  how is that a european equivalent ? 
  high mobility within the eu and high proximity of the member states can make it advantagous to know about the basic things within the eu . 
  more generally i 'd like to hear of european startups for a change . 
  ca n't be possible that services start exclusively in the us . 
  spotify comes from sweden , skype was launched in estonia . 
   people do n't realize just how much greatness can result when americans and europeans stop the ignorant bickering and put their talents together . 
  qft . 
  for the time being i 'll learn about my surroundings , then i can deal with cooperation . 
  added nonetheless . 
  thank me by promoting and participating in the subreddits . 
  that sub has like 5.2 times the amount of subscribers as / r/eupersonalfinance !, 
  yes , but e.g. 
  in germany the person hosting the website can be held liable for copyright violations . 
  in other countries it might be different , i do n't know , i 'd rather devote my time to find out how to save a bit more money , protect my privacy or learn a bit more about this strange world . 
  just contact me when it is up and running , then i 'll add it on the list and you can make an announcement in this sub . 
  thank you . 
  i 'd love to , but i do n't have the time and expertise to deal with it , especially legal issues . 
  and moreso i want to take advantage of the opportunities given by the common economic space . 
  feel free to contribute !, 
  but i ca n't buy a house because i necessarily have to live in the center of one of the two biggest cities in my country . 
  i mean , how could i move to a cheaper area ? 
  they have completely different cultures there and say `` pop '' instead of `` soda '' , i 'll never get used to the linguistic change . 
  and how do i pay my student loans and all my credit card debt ? 
  also , do i pay the debt with 8 % interest off first or the one with 4 % ? 
  it does . 
  but us law is not and should n't be applicable to europeans living in europe , so the bitching about how congress does n't respect my rights as a us american citizen , which i am not , is quite uninteresting . 
  for that i 'll go to / r/beer and have a look at the sidebar to learn that beer is exclusive produced in the usa . 
  is it better now ? 
  there are actually quite some subreddits dedicated to the more european aspects of various things instead of bitching about comcast ( / r/technology ) , the nsa ( / r/privacy ) , jerking about the mfa uniform ( / r/malefashionadvice ) and so on . 
  if there is interest i might compile those subreddits . 
  edit : [ here it goes ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2egelh/a_noncomprehensive_list_of_european_equivalents/ ), 
  i do n't even understand . 
  especially i do n't understand why some substances should be prohibited to be prescribed by a physician . 
  sure , there are plenty of substances that are invariably harmful , but that is a matter of medical knowledge and thus it is the duty of the medical practitioner and the medical community to take care of . 
  so if and only if marijuana is beneficial to a patient , should a physician be able to prescribe it and should pharmaceutical companies be able to research and produce it . 
  as for recreational marijuana , there is a lively debate going on in the united states . 
  are there major differences between the debate over there and here ? 
  because if there are not , colorado and washington will provide two great case studies . 
  personally i expect legalisation of marijuana to increase tax revenue for the state and reduce expenses in the form of decreased policing costs and joblessness . 
  bold move , see how the crowd reacts . 
  i think this is how the hundred year war started . 
  for better comparison , include a decimal sperator and remove the asterisk . 
  you also skipped russia . 
  i 'm in love with megaprojects like these . 
  it strange to think that using a car is still cheaper and faster than using a train for a lot of lines . 
  i 'd be inclined to move to denmark , though i need some more information . 
  * how is the availability of alcohol ? 
  i heard prices can be pretty high even adjusted for purchasing power . 
  as a beer lover this is a turnoff . 
  * how do the women compare to other nations , specifically nordic countries , estonia and russia ? 
  * attitudes to other countries , do they hate the french as much as we do or do i have to integrate through hating on the swedes ? 
  * w\u00f6rk . 
  do the danish love their rules and w\u00f6rk as much as we do ? 
  and people say it is the germans that do n't have a sense of humor . 
  italian engineering . 
  i did n't know belgium had nuclear plants . 
  also , i thought this would be another `` nuclear plants of europe '' or something like that . 
  it is not obvious to me how this bot works . 
  is the code open source ? 
  which i do n't mind . 
  personally i highly dislike the german wikipedia 's practice of deleting articles without `` encyclopedic relevance '' . 
  so life in germany is pretty much as good as it gets ? 
  edit : i see that there are several european countries with higher hdi , most notably norway . 
  i tried to indicate with the `` pretty much '' that there is little difference between e.g. 
  netherlands , switzerland and germany . 
  norway i ignore because of their ridiculous oil wealth . 
  hey , i remember the first one . 
   meneame.com is it just spain or the whole spanish speaking world ? 
  wonder if romania and croatia will adopt the euro . 
  hungary seems favourable too but that wo n't be happening soon . 
  the point about mandarin was more an afterthought , not my point . 
  i certainly wo n't desire a future where we 'll have to learn chinese instead of english . 
   i did get the sarcasm part , do n't worry !, 
  but still , my point stands . 
  it 's not a secret that berlin is full of districts where the locals speak only english , and never bothered to learn german at all ( and then get all pissy because they ca n't understand anything ) . 
  in large cities there 'll always be such districts , it is just natural . 
  my point is we should not encourage things like that with ` internationalisation ' . 
   not sure if you mean my comment in / r/germany , but i was n't entirely serious about that . 
  mandarin has like 8000 symbols . 
  learning japanese is easy-mode compared to that .
