  comparison with western countries shows that the wealth gap is closing . 
  situation similar in germany . 
  we have a host of advanced institutes like max planck or fraunhofer and universities focus more on teaching . 
  i am confused , do i have to learn dutch , swiss german or norwegian ? 
  at least all of those are germanic languages . 
  i could n't sleep and i was bored . 
  and in my experience these threads gather comments throughout the day anyway . 
  there is the game where you name all the states in the usa and you end up hating yourself as per friends . 
  the equivalent game in europe is n't easy at all , i can tell you . 
  also i start to hate myself for not using arabic numerals but to write out the numbers . 
  this would be a lot more useful if it showed which other subreddits are overrepresented , that is how much / r/europe 's presence deviates from a random user . 
  i ca n't decide if pidgeons or seagulls are worse . 
  actual translation from a native speaker :  discussion in the energy sector is about shutting down nuclear power prematurely , because revenue for a mwh of energy is only 35 to 37 euro instead of 50 euro - and the nuclear fuel tax comes on top of that . 
  `` it 's a fact that nuclear power plants mostly pay off for the government because of the nuclear fuel tax '' , says mike winkel , ceo of eon . 
  how about foreign spying on residents in the eu be forbidden , but europol helps to coordinate the investigations according to local law by the respective law enforcement agency ? 
  of course i 'd prefer to have less secret services , but that is a pipe dream . 
  foreign spying on non-eu countries or even just non-eea countries can then be done by a eu agency . 
  though i fear that this will be the first step to a behemoth america 2.0 with gigantic military spending . 
  intuitively i would assume that `` efficiency '' of a health care system would be some measure of how much other stuff you have to give up in order to have a longer , healthy life , that is , how much you have to pay to have either one more healthy year or the same number , but more healthy years . 
  either way , i do not think the efficiency can be described in any single measure . 
  it is strange how the opinions can change around here . 
  i remain strictly non-interventionist , which admittedly is easy to say when none of my friends or family are killed or my property destroyed . 
  i would hate it very much to see europe rise to be part of the world police . 
  much more effective and peaceful measures , especially long-term , would be the introduction of something like designated asylum areas , so that the eu can in cases like these in a short period of time absorb a large number of refugees , pulling the rug from under any would-be dictator . 
  support any democratization process in our neighbourhood : for any power regents chip away , offer benign relations . 
  and so on . 
  but not , under any cost , reach for armed intervention , as it is a far too great power to wield for any person . 
  definitely not like this . 
  if you have two populations that differ only with respect to their lifestyles while having the same health care system installed , you will necessarily see lower efficiency in the less healthy population though you have by construction the same healthcare system . 
  a more appropriate , but infinitely more difficult , measure would be the cost of additional quality adjusted life years given a certain lifestyle . 
  this measure obviously ignores any efforts to induce healthier lifestyles in general , but still allows lifestyle changes as medical interventions . 
  i would love to have the freedom to live in canada , australia or new zealand . 
  and a few others . 
  ( i am going by the commonwealth realm which is different from the commonwealth of nations ), 
  i would have mixed feelings about it . 
  virtually all economists agree on the benefits of free trade , but this `` free trade agreement '' bullshit comes with a load of regulations and laws that will actually only benefit the elite . 
  drone strike incoming . 
  could n't be , market reforms obviously only benefit the capitalist elite . 
  european human space flight ? 
  yes please . 
  how about having two totalitarian regimes in a single century with extensive privacy intrusions ? 
  `` nobody quite butchers the english language like a native speaker . '', 
  literally the * bafin * recognized bitcoin as * privates geld * , private money . 
  this is in contrast to * amtliche w\u00e4hrung * being reserved for government backed currencies , or to be more specific for a certain subset of those currencies . 
  so a legally more accurate dictionary would say that money is * geld * , currency is * w\u00e4hrung * and legal tender * amtliche w\u00e4hrung * . 
  just note though that all these words have different meaning depending on their context so the exact legalese formulation and interpretation will be in the future and is far from certain . 
  the word `` currency '' has a general and a special meaning . 
  in the general sense , currency and money are identical . 
  in the special sense , currency stands for money in actual form as used , which usually means banknotes and coins . 
  even in the special sense currency can still be issued by a private entity such as gold nuggets as the requirement is just to have the money in actual use . 
  money issued by government or mandated by it is called legal tender and captures your notion of currency more accurately . 
  then again , the recognition of bitcoin as currency means it is recognised as money . 
  but that is not what happened , it was recognised as a unit of account ( * rechnungseinheit * ) which by my understanding can be read as `` yes , you can calculate with it , but actually you are using euros . '', 
  edit : reading over it and thinking about it again , things seem to be more complicated . 
  the bottom line though is that bitcoin are not outlawed and fall within an existing legal framework . 
  i 'm seeing this more often lately . 
  it is amusing that when it is for your benefit , it is policy in favour of the small man against the big guys . 
  if it helps someone poorer than you , then it is policy in favour of the big guys at the cost of the small man . 
  the sad thing is that everyone of course agrees that peace , harmony , freedom , cooperation , all those things , are good and necessary , regardless of political affiliation or actions . 
  but nobody agrees on how this utopia can come about . 
  even worse , those with similar approaches varying in details spend their time debating the course of best action though any of their approaches seems more promising than the current state . 
  it is a rule of thumb for typical growth rates in economics . 
  nothing all too special . 
  it 's highly intuitive once you realise that all exponential processes are strictly monotonic and can thus be transformed into linear processes , in this case by logarithm . 
  taking the logarithm will yield two linear curves with different slopes and cutting points with the y-axis . 
  in other words , whole world growing , france , spain , greece , a couple of other european countries and a couple of other countries shrink . 
   then , i realized that if country 's a gdp is double than country 's b and country 's a growth is a bit more than half of the growth of country 's b , then country b will never catch up . 
  um , yes it will . 
  assuming exponential growth , which is equivalent to assuming constant growth rates , any exponential function with greater exponential coefficient will cross any function with exponential coefficient smaller than that , regardless of initial values . 
  well , not catalonia specifically , i had spanish in mind . 
  their cuisine . 
  i am not happy where i am right now but that is less of a problem with respect to location but more my attitude to life . 
  traveling or moving would be just changing the stage but taking my problems with me . 
  that being said , europe is such a colourful continent that i would hate myself for any one choice . 
  currently i live in one of the richest countries on earth , with a temperate climate and made especially mild by circumstances of local geography . 
  i could see myself living for a while in ** catalonia ** . 
  it 's technically spain but by the time i 'd leave here they would be considered seperate . 
  nice , warm climate , great food and great scenery . 
  also i would love to learn catalan as speakers supposedly can understand both castillan spanish and portuguese . 
  a language with about 400 million speakers can never hurt . 
  after having spent my time there , exploring barcelona and some of the smaller landmarks i could see myself moving to ** norway ** , maybe after having visited some of the other countries for a couple of weeks . 
  in norway i would enjoy a nice summer , suffer a winter , see aurora borealis and learn about scandinavian culture . 
  i should have little problem integrating as i learn norse and thus to understand both swedish and danish . 
  as i work there i profit from extremely high wages and my savings will help financing further trips . 
  right next to norway , after a trip through sweden and finland , is ** russia ** where i just want to visit something that is not quite european but not quite out there like china . 
  my savings from norway will come in handy here should i not find work . 
  i actually do n't know that much about russia but the myth surrounding it fascinates me . 
  zigzaging through europe , staying here and there , tasting this food or picking up a few words of that language there i will take a last stop in ** switzerland ** to see what the fuzz is all about . 
  are they that different from proper germans after i have seen so much from europe ? 
  weary from my travels , wiser by years and sure more knowledgable i will enter ** germany ** again . 
  maybe to one day set foot again on a long voyage or to settle down for the rest of my life as i think there is no place like home . 
  or i become a perpetual traveler as i have no home . 
  this series thing is getting out of hand . 
  seems about right in germany , though i tip more or less if the rounding leads to ridiculous tips in either direction . 
  my guideline is 10 % for good service , less for sub-par , more for stellar . 
  wow , like what ? 
   in italy a lot of local languages are still very much so alive even though standard italian has become the lingua franca ( i.e. 
  so i think that national languages will be able to survive the use of english . 
  how similar are these local languages , anyway ? 
  are they mutually intelligible or no way ?
