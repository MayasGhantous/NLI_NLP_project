  thank you . 
  what i do n't really get is why such agreements have to be mutual . 
  ca n't the governments of lithuana and poland ( with permission of the rest of the eu ) just allow belarussian people to enter the territory with or without permission of belarus ? 
  i want all the balkan states in the eu . 
  take a guess who 's the next country . 
  depends . 
  if you do standard things like reading nicely formatted csv files , basic plots and fits it is very much fun . 
  but if you already have knowledge of python you could consider matplotlib and one of the two statistical packages the names of which elude me . 
  doing maps with r is definitely not fun or the reports i read just suck . 
  or it is just me . 
  incidentally , i tried to fight with r to produce a map of europe but alas i failed . 
  are you skilled in r and can plot on maps ? 
  exactly . 
  sounds interesting . 
  a first map could be a simple `` where are you from ? '' . 
  what software do you use to make these maps ? 
  the same argument applies to insurance and practically every other venture in the economy . 
  yet strangely we producy roughly as much as we consume . 
  make it a seperate country so everyone is unhappy . 
  then how come the state can ? 
  it is a start . 
  you do n't understand , consumers are idiots and do n't know what they want and producers are idiots too because they can not plan increases in demand . 
  in another thread we discuss how underfunded fusion research is . 
  comparing iter 's annual budget of 500mn euros to ` optimal ' funding levels of 20bn euros and the cap budget makes me sad . 
  they did us a great disservice with their opposition to nuclear power , whether fission or fusion . 
  both thorium reactors and iter could solve major problems combined with electric cars . 
  but oh well , it is not about having a rational discussion but showing how concerned you are . 
  usually lack of lighting at night is a sign of serious underdevelopment . 
  i am too lazy at this point to research the state of bosnia but want to state this . 
  i might add that not only the content of your mail is interesting but also the mere fact that you contacted a particual person might be interesting . 
  though i do n't know how that can be masked . 
  the eu comission said they would grant albania candidate status upon completion of democratic elections . 
  we will see during the eu summit if that will actually happen . 
  oil platforms . 
  more interestingly the title is '' ** brits ** have to go to ** europe ** [ ... ] '' , implying that one is not part of the other . 
  but but debt is only evil if you do not owe it in your own currency . 
  otherwise you just can print as much as you want with no ill effects whatsoever . 
  macedonia is most certainly not in the eu . 
  greece has a dispute with them over their name . 
   serbia is unlikely to join the eu before 2020 . 
  of its fellow ex-yugoslav republics , slovenia joined in 2004 , croatia follows on july 1 and tiny montenegro began membership talks last year . 
  macedonia is a candidate while bosnia has yet to apply . 
  and albania has yet to be recognised as a candidate , at that point we will have all the balkan states . 
  anyhow , i am curious about when all those states will accede . 
  considering that so many people are sleep deprived and have a long commute , i was thinking that getting a bit more sleep on your way to and from work would be much more beneficial for quality of life and productivity . 
  on the way , the car drives optimal meaning a decrease in fuel consumption benefiting the driver 's purse , energy prices and the environment . 
  the car drives safely , avoiding collisions reducing risk of death or injury , reducing cost of insurance and improving welfare . 
  as a machine can operate more precisely than a human could the cars can drive at a higher velocity and closer to each other , further increasing efficiency of roads , reducing their maintenance cost and delivering goods cheaply to their consumers leading to better prices . 
  i ca n't stress this enough . 
  self-driving cars can improve virtually every aspect of road transportation for humans . 
  get there quicker , safer , more comfortable for less money . 
  life is too short for sitting around and with this life could be just a bit longer . 
  this is going to be fun . 
  with all the news about the google car i did n't know germany has a lead . 
  in any case , self-driving cars are a huge deal though people would not realize it . 
  safer , cheaper , more efficient . 
  cool . 
  let 's see what comes out of it . 
  first note that we are talking about the eu budget here . 
  to be funded by the eu and being consistent with the subsidary principle means that no smaller political entity can meaningfully deal with the issue . 
  in the case of transport i want to point out that the majority of french highways and a huge part of italian highways are privately owned or leased . 
  us american private freight transport on rail is a gigantic success story . 
  all airlines are organized privately . 
  it certainly is n't the case that private companies are incapable of providing transportation , they can play at least a huge to major role in that . 
  research is a strange issue . 
  we have huge r&d expenditure by companies for short-term profitable projects like microchips and medicine . 
  and then we have government research on all scales from a small field study up to flagship projects like the iss . 
  usually people - mainly the researchers themselves - argue for the necessity of such research but the actual economic research is much more conservative in estimating the benefit of such research . 
  i will not make any judgement about the necessity as i have almost no information on that issue . 
  and you are doing a great service . 
  but getting rid of the strasbourg parliament would be nice feather in your hat , would n't it ? 
  because i think that the vast majority of government subsidies is wasteful . 
  since choosing `` nothing '' is not an option i chose `` transport and infrastructure '' , `` research and innovation '' and `` energy and digital networks '' . 
  hope to see electric cars with supporting grid , better rail transport , space research and maybe driverless cars . 
  the nice thing about this form is that they randomize the order in which the points appear . 
  traditionally it is the job of the english to annoy the french ... 
  how do you think social policy from fdp could look like ? 
  [ wahl-o-meter ] ( http://www.wahl-o-meter.com ) shows them at more than 7 % , the rest of the numbers do coincide with other polls . 
  then again , it is only the actual vote that counts . 
  how about not having `` too big to fail '' ? 
  think about how it is with wildfires . 
  if you put out any little fire kindling will gather and just make the next fire so much worse . 
  a good fire now and then is good for the forest and makes the system stronger . 
  maybe we should let banks fail every now and then . 
  of course it is the creditors that have to suffer not all the people . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  i have now expanded my spanish vocabulary . 
  i will take a guess at the questions . 
  are you an alcoholic ? 
  do you have an attitude problem ? 
  do you speak spanish exclusively ? 
  did you get a lobotomy ? 
  thing is markets are extremely efficient in figuring out how to avoid costs and to capture benefits . 
  if 1 tonne co2 produces damage at the cost of reversal at say 10 $ then the producer of that amount should have to pay that exact amount . 
  where do you live then ? 
  flair up !, 
  on second reading of your post , number one does not apply to germany , we have a progressive tax system . 
  that is exactly how it is in germany . 
   the dutch letter did not call for eu treaty change , but said there were various `` issues which the netherlands believes could be left more or less entirely to member states : halting the further harmonisation of social security systems ; working conditions , which should only be regulated in broad outline ; no eu regulation of media pluralism ; flood risk management should only be harmonised at european level for truly trans-boundary water courses ; phase out the eu programmes for school milk and school fruit . '', 
  well that 's the basis of the subsidary principle : the smallest political unit that can meaningfully deal with an issue should deal with it .
