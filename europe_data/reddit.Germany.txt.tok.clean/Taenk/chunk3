  i did n't read that comment , can you link it ? 
  go to some university cities and they 'll be full with foreigners unable and unwilling to speak the local language . 
  my sentence was an attempt at sarcasm , hence the `` b-but '' . 
  it 's a shame that english is the global language , it gives a disproportionate advantage to the anglosphere . 
  maybe mandarin will displace it somewhat . 
  b-but how will we compete on the global stage ? 
  i see no point in teaching in english as higher education is free either way and teaching in german will keep the number of foreigners unwilling to learn german quite low . 
   i 've read somewhere that the russian government wants to turn kaliningrad into `` russian hong kong '' . 
  [ source ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6048708.stm ) :  [ ... ] moscow has declared it will turn the region into `` the russian hong kong '' . 
  so what we see is the change of relative purchasing power between eu members . 
  which is not very interesting . 
  damn , purchasing power per capita in the eu has n't improved in 10 years , that is bad . 
  not going to happen . 
  nato does n't admit member states with ongoing territorial disputes . 
  one more element to the shareconomy . 
  though i am certain this will be shut down by legal means because people distribute stuff beyond the best-by date or something like that . 
  see also [ european baccalaureate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_baccalaureate ) , equivalent to all national university-entry qualifying degrees in the eu . 
  personally i advocate having this kind of structure in more , regular schools in the eu . 
  damn estonia , you are smart . 
  where can i sign up for such a card and/or when can i get one ? 
  oil , arms exporter , foreign secret service , secret service of the military . 
  if anyone else was wondering . 
  w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk . 
  we have many dispersed , shorter breaks in germany . 
  when will the actual accession negotiations start ? 
  hope this will benefit their country as much as they hope . 
  it weirds me out that in so many ( economical ) statistics , the countries in the eu are counted seperately though the eu and more correctly the eea form a single , highly integrated market where it makes no sense to speak of seperate economies . 
  once the eu is taken as a single economic entity it is frightening on how many lists this thing appears as number one . 
  lack of personal responsibility and entrepreneurical spirit . 
  if you start a business , and you fail , you are seen as failure though you did something very brave . 
  people want to be pampered by the state and have no personal responsibility for their potentially wrong choices . 
  and of course the damn overregulation . 
  it is near impossible to operate a business without consulting a lawyer every couple of days . 
  maybe those were more than one but oh well . 
  even with all the critiques in this thread , there is a very interesting point to be made : the inequality in income distribution is very high in countries outside of western europe . 
  major cities are quite wealthy while the rural regions are more agrarian . 
  even a simple [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-speed_rail_in_europe#mediaviewer/file:high_speed_railroad_map_of_europe_2013.svg ) of high speed rail connections shows how important these things are . 
  south america should get unasur/unasul going and have a fta encompassing the eu and the whole of south america . 
  anyhow , i hope this goes through and the decade will be known as the decade of international free trade . 
  anything you suggest for the us to change will be met with a reference to the size of the us , ignoring that other extremely large countries and country-like entities like china , russia , brazil , india or the eu have different , viable systems and practices . 
  and the united states shrank by 0.2 % . 
  the west really is stagnating . 
  i wonder which institutions are older , if there are any . 
  i am skimming over the [ wikipedia article about the dutch army ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_dutch_army ) and there seem to be ** three ** brigades , two mechanised ones , with one of them , the unit mentioned in the article , being under german command . 
  so effectively 1/3 of the dutch army is under german command . 
  damn this is so interesting , i wonder if other brigades from other nations will follow . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.german-foreign-policy.com/en/fulltext/58539 ) is a link to an earlier article illuminating some of the rationale behind this . 
  if anyone has info about similar initiatives , please feel free to post them . 
  so is this cooperation with germany an exclusive thing or are there attempts with other militaries ? 
  this is the first time i read about actual efforts besides the eu battle groups , so many questions . 
   edit : wikipedia says this is only about training and exercises . 
  although that information could be outdated . 
  has to be outdated . 
  the article is pretty clear that this is * dutch troops * under * german command * . 
  holy crap , someone needs to explain the rationale behind this to me . 
  you can extend this note to all intellectual property , specifically copyright , trade marks , patents , though there is some minor work on harmonising these markets . 
  that scheme just makes way too much sense . 
  apperently there are [ five people alive who were born before 1900 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_living_supercentenarians ) . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  the popular vote came out in favour of restricting the number of immigrant workers but that has n't yet been put into action and probably wo n't be for any forseeable time . 
  for the time being , that agreement is still valid and active . 
  i want to expand on this as this provision is not only valid for the eu countries and its citizens , but for all the countries in the eea , that is the eu countries and norway , iceland , liechtenstein . 
  switzerland has a very similar , seperate agreement with the eu , but the freedom to work is a fundamental right in the ** eea ** , not just the eu . 
   i will rephrase my question to my fellow north americans then . 
  we could really benefit from such a system here . 
  i am an advocate of inviting canada to either join the eea or to negotiate an agreement with similar effect . 
   the european space agency ( which is the second best funded space agency in the world ) if all the space agency budgets of the member states were to be spent on the esa , it would have a budget of more than $ 10bn , compared to a nasa budget of $ 17bn , roscosmos with 5.6 bn and cnsa of $ 1.3 bn . 
  though the number for china is artificially low as most research is done by the military . 
  and the russians just increased their funding for the next years . 
  interesting . 
  though i am not sure what the causal relationship between the friendship treaty and the relationships with germany and usa respectively is . 
  vote to secede from the uk . 
  i love big projects . 
  we need more of these , like a gibraltar tunnel . 
   a very deep , if not worrying misunderstanding of what these people are about . 
  a testament to how effectively the mainstream media are misleading the public . 
  everything further right to the status quo is penned as being fascist , right-extremist , racist and all the other words that are in the books . 
  whether or not one agrees with their position , first on should know their position . 
  send them to us , if you want to work in a german speaking country anyway . 
  that is one impressive list . 
  i am tempted to learn romanian with all this good news . 
  why do you think this is bad ? 
  how about we have a single market for intellectual property ? 
  and energy while we are at it ? 
  and luhansk ? 
   german reunification bill hits $ 2.000.000.000.000 two ** trillion ** bucks ? 
  the bad thing is we can use this as an estimate for the cost of reunifying korea . 
  maybe until then we can use some kind of un fund . 
  the whole euro debacle is symbolic of the whole european integration process : many different opinions , little willingness to yield . 
  i 'm pretty much indifferent on the matter . 
  currency is a vital economic issue but has enormous symbolic power . 
   after the education rankings yesterday what did i miss ? 
  i did n't know we suck so bad . 
  basically , if someone is not a citizen , it is more likely for him to come from a country outside of the eu . 
  except for switzerland , liechtenstein , norway , iceland , ireland and benelux . 
  cyprus is settled by greek people i assume . 
  also virtually no one wants to move to lithuania , romania , bulgaria , croatia , turkey and finland . 
  a map breaking down eea/switzerland vs. non-eea/switzerland would be more informative as the former have the right of abode to work in all of eea/switzerland . 
  why are there more foreigners from outside the eu than from the inside ? 
  also why is there data on montenegro but not of the other balkan states outside of the eu ?
