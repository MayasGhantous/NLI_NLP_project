  so maybe asking university affiliated researchers `` so , how good are the institutes '' gives a slight bias . 
  are you sure the data is completely correct ? 
  when i go to the source the list is as follows ( eu members in bold ) : 1 . 
  switzerland 2 . 
  ** united kingdom ** 3 . 
  ** netherlands ** 7 . 
  japan 8 . 
  ** germany ** 9 . 
  australia 10 . 
  ** finland ** 11 . 
  singapore 12 . 
  ** france ** this is different from the graphic which apparently let uk and ch switch places . 
  that is 0.4 % relative to the previous quarter . 
  the eu gdp grew 1.6 % compared to the same quarter in the previous year . 
  edit : interestingly , the data does not match up with yesterday 's link to [ bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-12/east-tops-west-in-europe-as-consumers-power-economic-resurgence ) . 
  correct . 
  it is absurd to expect otherwise , that is to expect to be employed if you can not speak the language of your clients , which for a government employee is clearly the official language , in this case english . 
  they 're not wrong . 
  however the inability of the eu to react is kind of a feature , since such a massive consensus is needed to act . 
  a reaction to virtually all these crises requires either a transfer of sovereignity to the union or shared action between the union and its member , both of which require unanimous votes . 
  can you give a rundown of the australian system ? 
  i am not familiar with it . 
  if we would n't be living in absurdistan , border defense would be handled by a union agency and not the individual member states , seeing as for example the czech republic has a fraction of the costs that italy has . 
  the only exception is airports which could be handled cooperatively between eu and member state . 
  at the same time , immigration laws need to be harmonised or completely transfered to the union . 
  it is significantly more difficult to get polish citizenship than belgian , but a potential immigrant , due to aspiring to eu citizenship , is only constrained by the weakest immigration law . 
  asylum is governed by international treaties . 
  either we do away with the treaties or cooperate with each other , similar to the proposed border protection , as again for example austria has much lower costs to deal with immigrants than greece . 
  when you build a house with multiple tenants , they all share the costs of upkeep in a fair manner . 
  everyone pitches in if the roof has to be fixed and not only the ones living in the top floor . 
  if one wall is cracked , everyone pitches in and not only the people sharing that wall . 
  and so it is with the union : there should * not * be this kind of freeloading going on . 
  which is just natural , considering that they started a couple of years later . 
  sweet , thank you . 
  glad there is a lot of yellow . 
  edit : i 'm a bit surprised that there is no construction going on to connect the `` western '' and `` eastern '' parts yet . 
  also , what is the situation on the hungarian side , can you get to bors and arad via highway ? 
  ah , can you give me a source ? 
  i know the map is from 2014 , so it can be a bit out of date . 
   there 's a highway being built between turda and sebes highways are sorely needed . 
  the [ e-road network ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_e-road_network ) is well developed in west europe but there is n't even a [ connection between romania and the rest of europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/europe_completed_motorways.png ) via highway . 
  i am very happy to hear that . 
  assuming this trend continues , how much longer until median wages in international euros are comparable to czechia or poland ? 
  interesting , thank you . 
  i 'm curious . 
  people always state that us does n't respect international law , other people say that the us is as liable as any other country . 
  are there examples of successfully suing and sentencing the us with them complying ? 
  or did the us `` just '' win all disputes ? 
  i never particularly understood why people are so adamant about government * doing * stuff instead of just paying for what needs to be done . 
  for example in netherlands `` public schools '' are actually private but paid for by the state . 
  in switzerland and netherlands all health insurance is organised privately with some government components . 
   worst thing is : you have no option of not continuing to fund such a system that works against you and go full private . 
  sure , you can go private , and pay 150 eur a month more , but you still have to pay that 250 eur a month for your national healthcare that 's trying to kill you instead of helping you . 
  not in germany . 
  if you manage to get out of the system once by either earning enough or being self-employed , you 're out . 
  as for why anyone would do that instead of `` just keeping the money under the mattress '' is that storing money costs money . 
  in the past when there was a full reserve syste , that is the bank always had to have your money on hand , you paid for keping your money there . 
  same here , large banks , insurers and pension funds now pay the frg for the privilege of getting their money back . 
  besides , some actors are forced to buy bonds by law like insurers or pension funds , so they not have much choice . 
  investors like blackrock or buffet would have a choice but choose to have some liquid reserves in the form of short term bonds and prefer to have the governments promise them liquidity instead of hoarding the physical notes themselves or paying their bank to keep the money on hand . 
  and the yield on five year bonds yield 0.00 % as seen on [ bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/germany ) . 
  next up , negative yields for five year bonds and zero yields for ten year bonds . 
  this is going to be a weird decade . 
  edit : there it is , five year bunds yield ** - ** 0.01 % . 
  though it also happened it february . 
  next stop : negative ten year bunds . 
  since when is the council of europe a country ? 
  a bandwagon is several carts behind each other . 
  you 're thinking of a bandaid . 
  your flag already says you 're us american . 
  personally , i would n't mind going to the newer eu members for non-emergency treatment if in return i get a combination of lower insurance payments and better treatment . 
  but if all the savings only go to my insurer i 'll just stay here instead of infusing cash into smaller economies where it could go a longer way . 
  if for some reason the topic of measurement systems comes up , it often goes like this : `` you should use metric , imperial is confusing . '', 
  `` but we went to the moon and you did n't , so it ca n't be that important . '', 
  `` nasa used metric since inception and the rocket designers were german . 
  the only time they used imperial a mars probe worth $ 400m crashed and burned . '', 
  '' ... '' in any case , we 'll see how it 'll be in the future . 
  the strange thing is that the us could switch to metric pretty easily , many things already are . 
  for example all containers are already marked in both systems . 
  21.1 \u00b0 c and 37.8 \u00b0 c respectively . 
   whereas americans prefer an average temperature of 70 degrees [ fahrenheit ] they prefer 21.1 \u00b0 c in non-barbaric units . 
  i find cooling buildings to that tempreature in high summer is just perverse , though i would n't mind retrofitting ac in those roten 70s buildings that completely overheat in summer to 35 \u00b0 c and more . 
   transaction took over an hour to complete strange , bitpay usually accepts transactions within seconds . 
  but , as you said , maybe they did n't trust that the transaction will ultimately go through with the lower fee . 
  it is a common occurence that transactions involving bitpay are problematic if the transaction takes longer than 15min . 
   you are an enthusiast , i do n't blame you for that , but in due time you 'll see what i meant . 
  reality is the harshest judge of all . 
  as you said , in due time we 'll see . 
  obviously you are quite informed and make valid points and we disagree over how serious the flaws are . 
  in either case i stand by my assertion that actively using bitcoin is the best kind of research and that the underlying technology will play a significant role in the future . 
   if it could scale , which is yet to be determined i most certainly hope it does . 
  either by a solution like lightning or increasing the block size . 
  but that is not for this discussion now . 
  i do n't se how any of the examples under criminal activity allow anything that is n't already possible with hard cash . 
  indeed , criminal organisations still use cash because it is even more difficult to trace than bitcoin . 
  the only conceivable scenario , i admit , is using those ancient wallets - manyare rumored to be inaccessible - where the original owner is unknown , but those will literally run out , making detection ever more easy . 
  for the second part , privacy solutions are being developed or are in place . 
  for the average user , the easiest solution is to use a wallet like coinbase or circle to pay for stuff which clearly mask the average user 's net worth . 
  as to `` vendor 's malpractice '' , this wholly reverses the classical situation where the vendor fears that a user 's credit card bounces . 
  solutions include classical escrow .
