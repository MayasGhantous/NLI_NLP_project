  as for regulation , some bitcoin users assume it wo n't come , but it most certainly will if bitcoin is to be accepted and widely used . 
  it most certainly will not be regulated on the protocol level but initiatives like bitlicence will become more prevalent . 
  in the absence of state regulation , free market solutions tend to pop up . 
  for example in germany we have a couple of `` trusted vendor '' brands and they seem to work . 
  so , overall , i am not sure what the objection is . 
  yes , bitcoin is not perfect , as all new technology . 
  yes , it can be used for illegal activity , as can anything else . 
  but both wo n't change without research , development and adoption . 
  just dismissing the whole thing as `` funny money '' or `` only made for illegal transactions '' is pretty unfair and unjustified . 
  in the exact same way basic research helps : you develop infrastructure and capabilities around the project of choice and with some luck the thing you are researching is extremely useful . 
  i claim that the first is certainly true and used as justification for research projects and i claim that bitcoin is actually useful as a value transfer tool in international context . 
  to be fair , those statements are correct if you ignore the meaning of `` money laundering '' ( correct : turning illegally earned income into legitimate income ; incorrect : anything else ) and take `` nobody uses it '' to mean `` nobody i know and nobody who would buy something legitimate . '', 
  lots of hate in the comments , you make me sad . 
  bitcoin is a fascinating technology and europe will be helped by experimenting with it . 
  i am surprised by how many young people want to learn russian , some of them because of their cultural background . 
  i am sure that there are electronic systems in place that measure the structural integrity of vehicles and could display that as a number of hitpoints . 
  yes , in a rational system border protection would n't be handled by the individual member states but by the eu , at least for schengen members . 
  the costs to italy are much different than the costs for denmark . 
  i think i 'm going to research how difficult it is to operate in germany as an estonian company . 
  their tax model makes it very attractive as opposed to german corporate company law . 
  currently i see no benefit to apply , that might change in the future . 
  i wish other eu countries had similarly advanced systems or would make advances to such a system . 
  that is one depressing list . 
  a benevolent ruler might force this kind of economy into manufacturing through massive export taxes for raw material . 
  think norway . 
  but , alas , that is not happening . 
  increased tourism : someone visiting hungary does n't need another visa to enter romania but can use just the schengen visa . 
  and vice versa , someone visiting romania can just hop over to hungary , decreasing the disadvantages of a romania-only visa . 
  again , the price tag is a mathematical necessity . 
  any ressources used to prolong one life can not be used to prolong another life and neither can be used for anything else . 
  for any given amount of insurance premium there is only so much that can be spent on lifes on average . 
  it makes no difference whether the insurance scheme in question is private ( where they will deny treatment after a certain point or continue sub-par treatment even if alternative , expensive treatments are available ) or governmental single-payer ( where drugs are only purchased or treatments only offered if and only if they cost less than a statistical life ) . 
  one has absolutely nothing to do with the other . 
  the us health care system is plain and simply broken with no obvious single cause . 
  attaching a price tag to a life is a necessity in designing environmental , health and safety regulation as any regulation comes with the benefit of lifes saved but costs incurred . 
  if you put no price tag on a ( statistical ) life , there is no rational way to decide if any given regulation is beneficial or not . 
  take for example safety gear in automobiles : before they become mandated , some safety-conscious individuals buy them voluntarily and after a while government mandates them for all cars . 
  when should this decision be made ? 
  let 's assume there is some safety feature costing $ 100,000 distributed over all new cars that saves 5000 lifes per year . 
  if we are willing to mandate that feature , we say a statistical life is more valuable than $ 20 , quite reasonable . 
  if , however , there is another safety feature costing $ 10,000,000 over all new cars that would save only five lives per year , we 'd need to value a statistical life at $ 2,000,000 . 
  arguably less reasonable . 
  playing with the numbers we can generate virtually any ratio and at some point we have to stop as with ever larger sums of money ever more alternative uses become apparent . 
  this happens both at the individual scale ( `` two more years of life but no inheritance for your children '' or `` arrive half an hour faster and risk more accidents or not '' ) and at the societal scale ( `` two thousand lifes saved or affordable travel for everyone '' or `` ten thousand lifes saved or half hour travel time more for everyone '' ) . 
  no matter how you slice and dice it , there is a tradeoff between health/safety and other ressources which in a market society will be expressed in terms of $ per statistical life . 
  are health worker salaries set by the central government ? 
  because that seems a bit strange to me . 
  for context : personal income tax in romania is a flat 16 % . 
  [ source ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/taxes/income-taxes-abroad/romania/index_en.htm ) i could n't find a quick source for the amount of government revenue from personal income tax and vat respectively , so i could n't make a quick calculation for the impact of reducing the income tax to zero either . 
   paid in euros how does that work ? 
  do you have a euro denominated account with which you pay for stuf in euro or do you still pay in ron ? 
  get out of here with your russian . 
  i do n't know anyone who has been to georgia , so that alone will be a fun little distinction to have . 
  it is actually only the south that i consider greece 2.0 . 
  a look at any reputable source will show that northern italy has comparable levels of wealth to germany and south italy , especially sicily , is very poor , comparable to eastern european states . 
  then again , almost the same can be said about east - and west germany, 
  georgia seems like a fun country to visit at the crossroads between western culture and the middle east . 
  basically after working on your doctorate for way too long you are either brave enough to realise that your field is oversaturated with competitors and switch to private industry in a completely unrelated function or you stay at university and beg your government or anyone really who is willing to grant you some money until maybe , hopefully after moving ten times in fifteen years you get a permanent position as a professor where you begrudgingly do your necessary teaching requirements and continue to beg for money because the paltry research budget you have is n't enough to do grade a research . 
  of course i dramatise but this is it basically . 
  and i have talked to professors who basically said `` mr. / u/taenk , go work at a private company , at least you 'll make decent money . '', 
  admitedly , i have n't left my country for very long to see other points of view , maybe the system on this part of the earth is the same as elsewhere and i am just being a drama queen . 
   i think it would be fair that if you decide to use your education to work in another country , you should reimburse the state . 
  you mean people should actually pay for their education ? 
  / s but it actually is quite a problem in countries where graduates tend to leave : not only does the state pay for quite expensive education , the state foregoes the taxes possibly paid on work done in the same time . 
  after this investment all possible gains are lost to the country hosting the grad , reaping all the benefits , paying none of the costs . 
  but seeing as one of the purposes of increasing tax rates is to pay for education the state paid for , should immigrants also get a tax break after they paid for their education in their home country ? 
  that is actually a fascinating system : graduate , teach some , research some , take a couple years off to turn findings into a company and then return to teach some more . 
  that is something i have not heard about in germany , might also be because i am not in life sciences and the field i study is more removed from application . 
   one might say because otherwise it allows a company to stock up on profits , before eventually being distributed all at once in a single year . 
  this means the government receives a spread out income on a relatively certain base , which it in turn needs to finance it expenses . 
  senseless . 
  a company only makes profit when it sells material , product or services . 
  these are all atxed via vat . 
  even if that was not the case the company needs to pay its workers and shareholders , since those want to consume . 
   other reasons why there is a corporate income tax : - it contributes to taxes being levied in the country of operations . 
  employees can work across the border and so get taxed in their country of origin/domicile . 
  the tax break rule accomplishes exactly that : domestic shareholders deduct the profits tax from their personal income tax , no net effect . 
  foreign shareholders have to pay profits tax at the companies place and can most probably not deduct . 
   it prevents people from using their company as an extention of their personal wealth , i.e. 
  buying a company car , a house or anything and reporting it as a business use , while in reality it functions as mainly private use . 
  does n't give an advantage in a system where you only tax distributed profits , since the function is linear . 
  actually corporate tax * encourages * this kind of behaviour since instead of distributing the profits and having them taxed you buy stuff in the company 's name and write it off as a business expense . 
   by extention , companies compete with natural persons in relation to work . 
  take for example a woodworker who is self-employed and due to his nature , position , . . only has a turnover of 100.000 eur . 
  he 'll get taxed on a quarterly or even monthly base , so this needs to financed ( money costs money ! ) . 
  meanwhile a competitor is larger , has a turnover of 1.000.000 eur , but it 's a company ( i.e. 
  shares , name differences from country to country ) . 
  it should n't get taxed ? 
  this would give it an unfair advantage as the earnings are n't all fully paid out in wages . 
  the woodworker should open a company if only for liability reasons . 
  i see no reason for not applying the same rules for self-employed people . 
  actually , there should be form of company you can open with one euro especially designed for self-employed people . 
   a corporate tax also allows for the use progressive taxation based on revenue , giving smaller companies more space to try and build up so they can compete with bigger , already established companies ( i.e. 
  encourage entrepreneurialism , startups , . . ) . 
  it also means that companies with a larger profit carry a larger tax burden ( strongest shoulders carry most principle ) . 
  progressive taxation of companies is a complete and utter illusion . 
  a company is a legal construct to coordinate the flow and organisation of capital , land and labour , not a natural person where this principle could apply . 
  progressive taxation of companies artificially decreases company sizes and precludes developments that could help consumers , workers and shareholders . 
  in the no-tax regime the two companies merge and produce ** 5 quid less profit ** instead of staying seperate , assuming that they do not distribute the five quid profit for no obvious reason . 
  in the tax regime the two companies merge and produce ** 4.60 quid less profit ** instead of staying seperate , assuming that they do not distribute the five quid profit for no obvious reason .
