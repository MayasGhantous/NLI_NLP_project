  -- there absolutely no economic reason to reduce profits by five quid through the merger , you do n't save one pence by merging if you only motivation is `` my supplier is making a profit '' . 
  once that is clear you increase the profit numbers by five gbp and see that in the first situation there is no change through a merger , but in the second there is . 
  and it favours the larger company . 
  smallbusinessa supplies largecompanyb with a widget for 20 quid and makes 5 quid profit because they pay 15 british money for their supplier . 
  largecompanyb sells the processed widget for 50 quid and makes 30gbp profit . 
  the two companies together produce 35 quid profit for their shareholders . 
  now they merge and only produce 30 quid profit . 
  why should the shareholders agree to that ? 
  how does this not make sense ? 
  in situation one the two small companies pay more in taxes than the one big company in situation two . 
  this is the exact thing that would happen in a system where company revenue is taxed , so companies have a motivation to fuse . 
  currently however you can deduct your supply chains taxes , giving the vat system and equalising the situation between the two small companies and the small big one . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with `` surrendering profits '' . 
  assume that without taxes you have a widget that is made from raw material worth 100 $ in two steps : someone able to do the second step is willing to pay 100 $ for the first finished step excluding material . 
  the final product survives for 300 $ on the market . 
  tax rate is 10 % . 
  if we have two small companies doing one step each , the first company buys raw material for 100 $ , sells the semi-finished product to the second company for 200 $ and pays 20 $ in taxes , making 80 $ profit after paying for the raw material . 
  the second company sells the finished widget for 300 $ , pays 30 $ in taxes and makes 70 $ profit after paying their supplier . 
  total tax is 50 $ . 
  if we have one big company doing both steps , they sell the widget for 300 $ , pay 30 $ in tax and make 170 $ profit after they pay the 100 $ in raw material . 
  total tax is 30 $ . 
  the large company that internalises these trades , that is the company that does ever more steps in house instead of buying the finished steps from smaller companies massively reduces transaction costs since taxing revenue directly acts as a massive transaction cost , as shown above . 
  however , this exact problem is solved by vat : companies can deduct vat they caused from vat they pay themselves , eliminating the effect outlined above . 
  i do n't even need to grab a pencil or an economics textbook to know for sure that this will massively bloat company sizes and disadvantages smaller companies . 
  vat does exactly what you want without any of the bad side effects and is even self-enforcing . 
  here 's a controversial opinion : corporate income tax is ridiculous , counterproductive and unfair . 
  natural persons have income that they need to spend to enjoy it . 
  a legal person however only has income in order to pay for its expenses and produce income for its shareholders , be it the workers themselves or someone else . 
  why then is the corporate income taxed once and then again when it leaves the company to enter the shareholders or the workers pockets ? 
  take a look at estonia : corporate income is not taxed , only distributed profits are taxed at the exact same rate and if you are a estonian resident you can deduct the taxes already paid from your personal income tax . 
  this regulation does not dissuade people from investing and reinvesting in their companies , it does not unfairly discriminate between domestic and foreign shareholders , it is easy and simple and it does not discriminate between small and large corporations : both are equally impotent to avoid this form of taxation . 
   we need to change to a system of taxing revenue over profit . 
   thank you for that wikipedia article , i had no idea so many countries already had free trade agreements with the eu . 
  no problem , knowledge is power . 
   on the one hand , that 's a shitty move by the west , on the other hand the third world and developing countries could have easily underbid western farmers who 'd hardly be able to make a profit without subsidies . 
  so it 's sort of understandable . 
  the sick thing is that western farmers can underbid farmers in developing economies with subsidies and they destroy local agricultural markets where free trade agreements are in place . 
  i am not sure about the situation without subsidies , seeing as heavy machinery , pesticides , gmo and fertiliser make produce dirt cheap but poorer countries do not have access to all of that . 
  my larger point being that guaranteeing food security and having free trade in agricultural products are not mutually exclusive , for example you ca have completely free trade in produce but the respective states still own fields in addition to private entities sufficient to nourish their population together with sufficiently filled granaries to bridge the time until next harvest . 
  it seems like a big waste of human capital and opportunities to drop ** global free trade ** for such things . 
  anyhow . 
   they have to be with stable or fastly growing social democracies . 
  associating your relatively stable and well-regulated economy with an unstable deregulated economy is like tying yourself to a curch bell and hoping it 'll never ring and you wo n't hang . 
  but it will , because that 's how economies work . 
  but fastly growing ( social ) democracies tend to have highly unregulated economies , at least with respect to things like safety and worker 's rights . 
  besides , the us economy has a similarly high amount of regulation as eu/eea companies , at least that is what i gather from my research on company regulations , especially taxes . 
    what we should be doing is open free trade agreement talks with ausralia and new zealand , south america , east asia and mexico so we can diversify our international trade . 
  this way , the next time somebody controlling billions on wall street messes up and causes a depression we wo n't get hit as hard . 
  mexico is already done . 
  south america and east asia ex china is in progress . 
  i agree on australia and new zealand . 
  ( see wikipedia , eu free trade agreements ) it is interesting to note that the member states of the wto were in talks for a global free trade agreement but it failed on count of agriculture : the western countries were not willing to give up agricultural subsidies . 
  so now ttip , tpp , gats and so on are the spawn of this failure . 
  i may have asked this in the past before , but here it goes again : what do you think , why is it that no other free trade negotiations attracted the public 's attention , including similarly far-reaching agreements like gats , but ttip suddenly seems like satan 's spawn ? 
  personally i wonder : who gains from ttip * not * coming through ? 
  no obvious organisation comes to mind . 
  they should join . 
  i 'd like to see more competition in development banks . 
  in principle i agree with a toll system : you use the street and infrastructure , you damn well pay for it - you do n't use it , you do n't pay for it . 
  but as with anything the state touches , it will be ruined and perverted until the principle is barely recognisable , so why bother . 
  it has gotten way more political . 
  when i started the `` what do you know about ... 
  series and before that we had a lot more stories about our respective countries , i think . 
  we had proportionally fewer uk residents before / r/europe became a default . 
  came just to my mind . 
  there is more , but not now . 
  is anyone seriously considering lowering the income tax ? 
  'cause that would actually make poland extremely attractive as a place of residence . 
  i regret writing that line . 
  it is just that i am fed up with the picture of russia being a real-life mordor attacking glorious , good europe and falsely assumed that your doubt indicated such a belief . 
  i apologise . 
  fair enough .

  both sides are brain washed . 
  russia pushed a visa-free agreement before the crisis . 
  it is only fair since we have visa-free access to those countries too . 
  wish we could have that with russia and belarus as well . 
  the dream of a visa-free europe could come true . 
  just legalise it already , god damn it , what is so difficult ? 
  reduced criminality , reduced law enforcement costs , reduced unemployment and associated costs , increased tax revenue . 
  continuing this line of reasoning we all have to live at the poverty line as long as there exists extreme poverty in the world . 
  i reject this line of reasoning completely . 
  involuntary homelessness in western europe virtually does not exist . 
  plenty of government programs are there to give the needed ressources , the people actually sleeping on the street all have some kind of mental illness or substance abuse problem that bars them from receiving government aid . 
  no individual is responsible for the welfare of the rest , at best it is the governments job to do that . 
  [ eurobarometer in april 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_400_en.pdf ) says 74 % in favour and 24 % against . 
  i doubt the poll in the article . 
  it 's amazing , is n't it ? 
  around that time i read your posts more frequently . 
  i miss that , they are very informative usually .

  i greatly enjoyed reading all the answers and about the time it showed up on some polish website . 
  i feel like a simple repeat is a bit boring . 
  some feature to mix it up would be nice .
