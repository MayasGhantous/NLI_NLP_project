  not yet global . 
  i seriously do n't know . 
  the concept [ is n't exactly new ] ( http://www.nber.org/papers/w6860 ) but it is n't proven either . 
  personally i think it is a fear of market mechanisms and some nonsense about `` nation-wide solidarity . '', 
  the only problems worthy of mention are young people who have n't yet had a chance to acquire a meaningful balance ( my solution would be to grant a credit at sovereign rate for some grace period and/or to allow balances to be transfered within first-degree relatives ) and people permanently leaving the workforce with a significant negative balance ( have n't thought about it long enough whether it makes a difference ) . 
  if there is interest i could do a write-up for this sub and also write a bit about how eu wide pensions and health insurance could be implemented in a similar fashion . 
  if we make a eu or ez wide unemployment benefit system , please make it capital based , that is workers pay into a tax-advantaged account and withdraw from it in case of unemployment until some other scheme kicks in . 
  if the balance on this accounts exceed income until planned retirement , give the option to liquidate the account and pay out like a salary for the remaining years and give the worker an early retirement . 
  overall this scheme avoids transfers for non-structural unemployment , increases savings rates and decreases supply of labour , thereby increasing wages . 
  this year it is also planned to introduce a first version of the system to the public . 
  we will have three active global positioning systems online : navstar , glonass and galileo . 
  i seriously hope for you guys that this means all streaming services catering to all european countries and no arbitrary restrictions on which movies from which countries i can or can not watch . 
  i chalk it up to balkan pessimism . 
  understandable , given their recent history , but they should n't give up on a chance like this just yet . 
  it wo n't be easy but i hope it will be worth it . 
  lower criminality , less police expenditure , more employment , more taxes . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  do n't forget suicide and birth rate . 
  though i highly desire a liberalised market in recreational drugs , i highly doubt it will pass . 
  at this pace , the single digital market will never become a reality . 
  strange that italians use mobile phones so much . 
  i thought you need picture too to be able to talk ? 
  leather would be nice , with the stars embossed . 
  does n't seem to hurt them much beyond being the butt of the joke that the imperial system is . 
  ** completely and utterly against english as standard language of the eu . 
  ** i could agree to a sole working language of the eu and second official language of all member states if and only if that language is an artificial one like esperanto . 
  edit : specification , a * working language of the eu * refers to a working language of the * institutions of the eu * like the commission . 
  having this language as official in a country merely means having the right to adress the institutions of that country in this language and receive a reply in the same language . 
  someone just died . 
  someone was just born . 
  someone just immigrated . 
  who 's imprecise now ? 
  if south america was n't so poor we 'd be learning just as much spanish as we 're learning english . 
  edit : [ some other languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers ) that could have similar importance to english are arabic , to some extent chinese , maybe russian again sometime soon and french . 
  but english reigns , for now . 
  [ 506 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union ) . 
  for those who are more comfortable with numbers than areas : the population of [ europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe ) as defined by the ural/black sea border is 742 million , the population of the us , canada , australia and new zealand is 385 million . 
  can you give a shot of the inside ? 
  alaska ? 
  then it would be a ferkelwelpe . 
  take a look at this [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/europe_topography_map_en.png ) and tell me which way seems easiest to russia and france starting from germany ? 
  the are [ quite some ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_specialized_agencies_of_the_united_nations ) important parts of the un , for example the who . 
  since belgium is a relatively flat country , as is poland , and wedged between two major european powers , it serves as a passthrough for military , as does poland . 
  you like fish sticks ? 
  you were occupied for some time by the nazis , but that is not really a stereotype . 
  failed state government , waffles , belongs to netherlands , belongs to france , passthrough for germany , poland of the west , crappy drivers , shitty roads , pedophiles , ... 
  i do n't hate the belgians , at all , they make great beer . 
  it 's just that there are quite some stereotypes about them . 
   unless you 're a nordic , then your stereotypes is about awesome you are homo , gender and kebap are becoming the stereotypes of sweden . 
  vodka and depression for finland . 
  i 've got nothing for norway , at best they 'd wipe their tears with their oil money . 
  you mean like the [ european investment bank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_investment_bank ) ? 
  okay thank you . 
  i see i have to learn a lot about the countries east of the eu . 
  so estonia could continue to tax only distributed profits like they do now ? 
  so , this might sound like a stupid question , but assuming i speak both english and russian fluently , with which one would i have more luck communicating ? 
  i think not . 
  how do indians deal with their national anthem ? 
  also the text really beautiful , as is the recording . 
   there are n't really any eu-wide online retailers to keep shops honest on prices . 
  i do n't know why it has n't happened yet , but i believe it will be good for consumers when it does . 
  if a shop has more than 100,000 $ in online sales outside of its country of incorporation , vat gets super weird . 
  see [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_value_added_tax#distance_sales ) . 
  this is something a more harmonised tax system could actually help . 
  i 'm sure if you look at finer points we could find more like currency conversions , cost of translation and not as extensive logistics networks . 
  but basically , i do n't see what stops someone from opening up a shop in their garage , registering a website , translating it to most of the european languages and then shipping their products with dhl to members of the eea . 
  product warranty ? 
  in germany you can return electronics after three months , no questions asked . 
  and then for up to two years the vendor has to fix anything that is wrong with you gadget unless it is obviously your fault . 
  like referring to citizens of the united states of america as `` americans '' ? 
  i do n't see the problem with that . 
  `` flat '' taxes usually have a progressive effect via basic exemption , government transfers and public services . 
  can we please make the harmonised system not retarded ? 
  do n't tax reinvested money , that is do n't tax undistributed profits , that is tax only distributed profits , like in estonia . 
  taxing running profits inhibits the growth rate unnecessarily and business owners want to get to their money sooner or later , so revenue will be generated . 
  ** [ actually , please make the whole tax system like in estonia . 
  ] ( http://taxfoundation.org/blog/estonia-has-most-competitive-tax-system-oecd ) **, 
  sartre is sitting in a caf\u00e9 and the waitress asks him what he wants to order . 
  `` i 'd like to drink a coffe , no cream please . '', 
  `` we 're out of cream , '' the waitress apologises , `` but we have milk , would you like a coffee with no milk ? '', 
  i see the rationale behind choosing to generate revenue through vat , an extremely difficult tax to avoid , second only to land value tax . 
  nevertheless i am pretty sure that a lower vat will actually lead to increased revenue . 
  pity german died in the us during the world wars . 
  hot damn you have 24 % vat ? 
  in germany we have 19 % and that was already an increase from 16 % some years ago . 
  descartes sits in a caf\u00e9 and sips on his coffee . 
  the waiter asks him : `` do you want a croissant ? '', 
  to which the philosopher replies `` i think not , '' as he disappears into nothingness . 
  if it was esperanto i could agree with the proposal . 
  but english ? 
  no , plain and simply , no . 
  better a good business partner than a bad employee ? 
  my gut feeling - but not from an objective or ideological standpoint - is that uk , canada , australia and new zealand would be better off with a union of their own , similar to the eu , and an agreement with the eu , similar to what switzerland has . 
  it seems more in line with the desire for cultural homogenity and the fact that the uk is often the odd one out with respect to eu policy . 
  better a happy seperation than an unhappy marriage , right ? 
  pity that this does n't include free movement of people , good , capital and services for all eea member states , the commonwealth and switzerland . 
  maybe in the future i guess . 
  edit : i usually understand when i get downvoted for my statements , but what did i do wrong here ? 
  i 'll drink to that . 
  [ no shit .
