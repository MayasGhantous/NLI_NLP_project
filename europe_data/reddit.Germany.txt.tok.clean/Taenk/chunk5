  we are indeed doomed . 
  i am so longing for a web in other tongues than english . 
  despite the naysayers on this sub most people in europe are not comfortable communicating in english and prefer their native language . 
  but there simply is no platform like reddit , at least not that i know of . 
  i thus want to extend the question further . 
  say i know only english , what else do i miss in terms of music , movies , series , books , whatever ? 
  there is a whole world out there and the anglophones represent a mere fraction of it . 
  way to take a joke too seriously . 
  i hope they can use one more physicist . 
  why the many downvotes ? 
  if people are federalist - and most around here are - you should support smaller governments as they can govern their people more effectively . 
  i need to move to switzerland . 
  oh wait , i ca n't because they wo n't allow any more immigrants in . 
  norway or switzerland ? 
  i wonder . 
  they were supposed to get official eu candidate status this january but a few countries vetoed that decision , postponing the decision to june . 
  that 's all i know right now . 
  or the same status as the bikini atoll or puerto rico . 
  i have the exact same question for israel . 
  what is this , olympic games for ants ? 
  it needs to be about ... five times this size !, 
  i 'll take that as a compliment . 
  must have been made by a us american . 
  cause their lack of geographic skills . 
  ok . edit : many butthurt . 
  despite the little flag next to my name , this is a joke . 
  why ? 
  because canadian provinces and mexican states are not depicted ? 
  i suppose the rest of the eu will wait until the mess with the currency is sorted out ? 
  i have been living under a rock . 
  lithuania will also adopt the euro by 2015 , being the last baltic country to do so ? 
  a more informative map would be something like `` average years of schooling '' . 
  is that in total ? 
  cause then it is enough i think for like four or five months . 
   eu 's 300 million [ 508 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_europe ) with some more million in the process of acceding is more realistic . 
  were you thinking about the usa ? 
  russia , what the fuck ? 
   `` die idea '' oops , corrected . 
  my reaction might have been a little bit over the top too , so call it even . 
  i wanted to extend / u/neutrolgreek 's comment in the direction of `` embracing principles as long as they suit you '' as it is one of my guilty pleasures to point these things out . 
  generally i think countries should look out for their self-interest while honoring commitments to other countries and not being dicks . 
  so a country making a move that is not * preferred * by germany is fair game . 
  dishonoring a previous commitment or working * actively * detrimental to another country is wrong . 
  which not so coincidentally is roughly the same i expect from individuals . 
  for fucks sake , the flag next to my name indicates the country i am residing in , not that i am a representative . 
  and vice versa . 
  just like democracy . 
  only valid when the populace supports * your * opinion . 
  i am speechless . 
  excellent job e-stonia , i hope the rest of the world learns from you here . 
  in germany there is the dream of the paperless office . 
  as our government is incompetent to introduce proper digital solutions there is the saying `` we are as far from the paperless office as we are from the paperless toilet . '', 
  little do they know that there are in fact [ paperless solutions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bidet ) . 
  maybe i went off trail here . 
  i hear estonia has the most models per capita . 
  say i have a higher education , what kind of lifestyle can i expect in estonia and how much of the time am i freezing ? 
  how will i heat my house with no paper ? 
  7 attempts . 
  god damn ` stans and those small arab states . 
   and no european government will accept it either . 
  why would you assume that ? 
  is a vote about independence being prepared ? 
  damn them . 
  indeed , the german language is so full of these gems and i am such a dunce for not appreciating them enough , i had to consult / r/doesnottranslate to bring a few of the words i liked here with my own interpretation . 
  * * alkoholleiche * or * bierleiche * names a person so incapacitated by alcohol consumption that they might as well be dead at the moment . 
  the literal translation `` alcohol corpse '' brings some of the meaning to the english language but lacks just the hint of the state being unnecessary . 
  * * doch * is a word that extends the english `` but '' . 
  i can say `` german has this word , but english does not '' , but i am unable to use ` but ' as a singular answer to negate a negative . 
  `` you did not ! '', 
  `` but [ i did ] '' makes no sense to the english speaker in the elliptical form but will seem overly confrontational to the german speaker in the extended form . 
  * * fernweh * is sometimes mistaken by the novice german speaker for wanderlust though it notes a different concept . 
  wanderlust , at least in german , is the desire to travel , but out of joy . 
  * fernweh * is the deep longing of the foreign , similar to home sickness ( * heimweh * ) , not because one finds no happiness at home , but because it pains to much to not know what is beyond the horizon . 
  * * fremdsch\u00e4men * can be translated as `` cringe because of others behaviour '' though only applicable as being ashamed when other people should be ashamed for their behaviour . 
  you ca n't * fremdsch\u00e4men * because of some annoying sound . 
  * * jein * is an amalgamation of `` yes '' and `` no '' and a somewhat colloquial answer to a statement not quite correct but not completely wrong either . 
  just as * jein * is neither `` yes '' nor `` no '' the statement is neither true nor false . 
  * * fressen * concludes this little list with naming the process of eating with the german word usually reserved to animals . 
  this gives just the proper amount of derision to people not eating properly , either in frequency , noise or quantity . 
  closely related is * saufen * which is the analogue of drinking . 
  * fressen * also appears in * fresskoma * , the state you are in after a particularly satisfying meal , unable and unwilling to do anything but stay at rest . 
  ** german ** `` i am sure the germans have a word for it '' many anglophones posit and indeed , the german language is full with fun little words providing a challenge to would-be translators . 
  while most of the words might have an equivalent in the other language , the translation will lack the perfect ring most of the time . 
  * * weltschmerz * is the feeling of despair as you realise that the physical world will never be able to live up to the ideal you have in your head . 
  why is there so much suffering in the world when we could see past our differences ? 
  * * zeitgeist * is a miracle of the german linguistic export market and the name for the whole of social , philosophical and political ideas at a particular time . 
  * * vorf\u00fchreffekt * might be something everybody experiences at least once . 
  you know when something works perfectly if you do it alone , undisturbed but goes wrong exactly when someone wants to see what you are doing ? 
  that is the * vorf\u00fchreffekt * . 
  * * backpfeifengesicht * is the face of any individual in dire need of a fist to the face . 
  i have never used or seen it myself but apparently it crops up in these kind of lists . 
   euro area 1.2 , 1.5 so fucking great . 
   [ ... ] anchored in europe europe is a continent containing part of russia , the vast majority of the eu members and some other countries . 
  please do avoid mistaking ` europe ' for the eu and excluding russia from the continent . 
  the latter ist just plain wrong and the former is an idiocy similar to calling the usa simply ` america ' . 
  of course they have huge potential though not in the way people usually seem to assume . 
  the biggest potential will be where they can displace human labour such as in freight , travel and delivery on short time scales . 
  the lufthansa strikes should have made it clear that human pilots have disadvantages compared to automated planes , especially considering that any routine on planes has been automated . 
  delivery then is the third are where i propose drones . 
  we already saw amazon working on delivery drones and considering their marketing expertise we can be sure that other companies are already working on this problem in secret .
