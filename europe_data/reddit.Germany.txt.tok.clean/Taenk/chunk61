  the rest of your post is then senseless . 
  150 hours over 52 weeks in a year is a little less than 3 hours weekly . 
  just imagine a europe where every kindergarten kid or elementary school kid gets taught esperanto for only three one hour sessons every week for one year . 
  at that tender age they 'll pick it up very easily , make it their own , and have a much easier time to learn all the other european languages . 
   or maybe spanish instead of french . 
  it 's easy to learn and a wide adoption outside of europe . 
  it would also be our secret weapon inside the us . 
  french and spanish are both spoken by massive populations outside of europe . 
  the only other languages with similar reach are modern standard arabic and standard chinese . 
  anyhow , i 'll continue arguing for esperanto instead of english , but i have little hope . 
  this , along with other things , is a very valuable lesson for me that people will decide against something even though it seems very rational and well-reasoned to me . 
  makes me wonder where i am this wrong . 
   exactly the same . 
  i favor this idea of esperanto becoming a recognized language . 
  a lot of people overestimate the number of english speakers throughout the world , they believe that everybody knows the language at a good level . 
  even in france it 's far from being the case and we are not the only country in europe where english is not that well spoken . 
  correct . 
  the vast majority of people in the world do not speak english fluently . 
  even in europe plenty do not . 
  this is just plain selection bias as most of the * online population * and more educated people speak and understand english well . 
   studies show that what would take you 1 500 hours to obtain a good level of english , you would only need 150 hours of esperanto to get the same level , as a french speaker . 
  what 's more , there have also been studies that learning esperanto first and then virtually any other language , will lead to higher fluency more quickly , supposedly because with esperanto it is easier to pick up grammatical concepts . 
  that is , the total time to learn esperanto and some of the other language is the same as just learning the other language , but you 'll be more fluent in the first case . 
   more over , united kingdom is leaving and the grin 's report shows how united-states is the winner of english being kept as the most taught language in europe . 
  it 's thus counter productive for our continent . 
  absolutely correct . 
  having a natural language as lingua franca puts the country speaking that language at a disproportionate advantage over all others . 
  a constructed language however puts everyone at equal ground and can soak up a common culture , building a clearer european identity . 
   i was thinking the same , happens to me too . 
  maybe we come across as anti-english , so the anglo crowd downvotes us . 
  he makes a funny defence of the english language , so comes across as conciliatory . 
  a lot to learn here . 
  i * am * anti-english . 
  having a natural language as world language puts native speakers at a disproportionate advantage over the rest of the world in many respects . 
  if the eu was to be a union of equals we need to promote all languages equally or one that is a common language . 
  having english as the sole official language or as a common second language breaks with the idea of equality . 
   yesterday i saw a quote taken from one of my comments get 1000 upvotes while my original comment had 100 . 
  compare this with [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1gf4qu/fellow_europeans_i_want_to_start_up_a_political/cajlz60/ ) and its parent . 
  oh no someone suggests esperanto , burn him . 
  whenever i float this idea i get plenty of downvotes according to `` we already have english '' , so i am happy to see that you get upvotes . 
  that kind of hurt . 
  dst is definitive proof that the absolute majority of people are both scientifically uneducated and unable to cooperate with each other . 
  if you were scientifically educated you 'd see that `` changing the time '' or `` keeping it on summer time '' are complete misnomers . 
  the 24 hours are put such that 0/24 corresponds to the lowest point for the sun and 12 to highest point respectively . 
  the only thing you change is the number your clock shows , it is physically impossible to have more or less time by changing the clock , the same way that your arrival time by plane can be behind your departure time , even though you did n't travel back in time . 
  changing normal time to summer time is like changing temperature scales between normal and summer scale such that `` it is equally warm all year round '' and `` to save fuel '' instead of taking appropriate measures to compensate for physical change . 
  speaking of , we come to the point of cooperation . 
  if your work is dependant on sunrise and sunset , like most people that work outdoors , you do n't care about summer time/normal time . 
  the sun rises and sets when it does and that 's when you can work . 
  if however you are independent of sunrise and sunset you have all the freedom in the world to discuss varying work times with your colleagues , that is arriving an hour earlier or later . 
   well , this simple analogy does n't take into account that we 've built dozens of systems that now depend on time change . 
  then name a couple of them . 
  how is germany on place four ? 
  usually in statistics we are beaten by all the nordics , netherlands , austria and of course switzerland . 
  on global statistics also very often us , canada , australia , singapore and japan . 
  sometimes uk , new zealand and south korea . 
  funny enough , the sheer selection of competition shows the level of development in germany . 
  structured cooperation and intelligence sharing . 
  why not ? 
  i have said it before and will say it again : we have a common external border , no internal border controls , no intention of ever waging war against each other again and extremely similar geostrategical viewpoints . 
  the only thing that makes sense is a common military and border protection force . 
  very few people should get letters from them , seeing as the actual ministries are more like central management for the operating agencies , like schools , hospital oversight , the tax offices and so on . 
  and for the rare occasion that you actually get contacted by them or order information material , the current design is just fine , since you only need to be aware `` i am communicating with the federal government '' and get informed about what is going to happen anyhow . 
   people here used to be strongly against free trade and it seems like it took a stupid american president to be against free trade to change people 's opinion toward free trade . 
  well shit , if that was all it took , we should have a us american president sabidly against a eu military and border protection . 
   i 'm not complaining , i have always been pro free trade and i 'm starting to think that having an ignorant anti liberalism us president was the best thing that could happen for liberalism . 
  that was one of the reasons i rooted for trump . 
  now suddenly everyone starts thinking about other partners than the us . 
  good , we already have a free trade agreement with south korea , so let us have one with japan too . 
  maybe we can turn all these bilateral agreements into something multilateral . 
  may the 21st century be the century of free trade . 
  there is still room for improvement . 
  actually there is plenty room for improvement , but it gets incrementally harder to scale . 
   [ ... ] i do think eu is expandable beyond the classic geographical borders of europe [ ... ] make the european union the eurasian union !, 
  incidentally , by most geographic accounts , cyprus already is in asia . 
  but more seriously , the eu should implement/initiate a board/category/treaty / block for all countries that do not meet criteria for full membership by geographic criteria or are plain unwilling , but is open to all countries with european values ( democracy , rule of law , free markets , equality , social security , worker protections ) to join . 
  potential candidates are most american countries , tunisia , south africa , namibia , japan , south korea , most members of asean , australia , new zealand , india , and i am sure more i did n't remember from the top of my head . 
  more countries could . 
  in germany for example the majority of the population wants popular referenda on the federal level and of the big parties in parliament , it is only the cdu that has an official stance against them , the rest are in favour . 
  ** thank you ** for saying that . 
  what annoys me to no end is that perceived failiures of direct democracy and/or referenda are held against direct democracy , but failiures of representatives in representative democracy are not held against representative democracy . 
  also the contrasting of the two as if they were contradictory and incompatible , even though you can use both for their respective advantages . 
  personally , what irks me with representative democracy is that one parliament can decide on commitments that will outlast it and are irreversible by future parliaments . 
  for things like that - permanent international treaties , extremely large purchases , constitutional changes , decades-long projects - it seems more fitting to ask the population directly , as it will be there long after any particular government . 
  if i heard correctly , they are really expanding business in eastern europe . 
   bets on the future in 2020 ? 
  give me a prediction market with a nice , usable interface and i 'll take those bets . 
  any suggestions ? 
  you 'll still have controlled borders with moldova , ukraine and serbia . 
  what is the advantage of border controls with hungary and bulgaria ? 
  and border control at airports connecting with other schengen countries ? 
   people think schengen it 's this magical place where everybody does whatever the f * ck they want , and it is , but it comest at a high cost most people do n't even think about . 
  i do n't know what you want to say with this . 
  schengen is a mutual suspension of border controls and sharing of data between law enforcement agencies . 
  where do you get the magical stuff from ? 
  it looks like you 'll need to be patient , for some reason western governments keep blocking accession to schengen . 
  great job . 
  the rest of the eu now should allow them to enter schengen and croatia to enter eea . 
  ** edit : ** jesus christ people , the eea is the ** e ** uropean ** e ** conomic ** a ** rea , also known as the single market , which alle eu member states are members of - except for croatia where the treaty is applied provisionally - as well as norway , iceland and liechtenstein . 
  this is different from the european monetary union or eurozone .
