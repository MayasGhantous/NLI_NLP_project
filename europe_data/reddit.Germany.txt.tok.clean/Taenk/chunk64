  i 'm not sure how to answer . 
  the more you sample/poll , the more polls you will have that deviate from the average for any given amount of deviation . 
  if you have a thousand people flip coins ten times in a row , one will have only heads and one will have only tails , assuming a fair , unbiased coin , does n't mean that these people have some special bias or that the coins are faulty , it is just normal variance . 
   if poll 1 happens and it is outside the margin of error , we have to conclude that poll 1 had some sampling or methodological fault . 
  that is exactly incorrect . 
  the `` margin of error '' is an intervall within which the true value with with some defined probability . 
  as a statistical certainty , some polls will be outside the margin of error and with the amount of polling it is no wonder that they differ from each other . 
   it does not make sense statistically to aggregate polls as each different poll has different sampling methods . 
  it makes perfect statistical sense to aggregate polls , especially since they have different sampling methods . 
  the only thing we need to assume is that any bias any one poll might have is independent from other polls and on average zero . 
  the same polls that correctly predicted all other elections , including scotland remaining . 
  every poll has an inherent prediction error , it is a statistical certainty that they will fail sometimes . 
  considering how close the election was and how close the polls were i have little reason to suspect methodological flaws and instead suspect variance . 
  maybe moods will change during negotiations when they actually start , maybe some years after if things go south . 
  or uk will be doing very well and the scots will want to stay because of that . 
  no one knows what the future holds for us . 
  personally i am hoping for an independent scotland in the eu and unified ireland . 
   indyref2 incoming . 
  polls show that the scots want to remain in the uk , sadly . 
  can anyone find a map for the previous period to show differences and progress ? 
  the map is extremely accurate in showing what it does : which regions are eligible for cohesion funds . 
  displaying purchasing power is done by a different map , there was one posted based on gfk data a few weeks ago . 
  god damn it , eastern germany is still visible . 
  god help us all . 
  is there any indication that we could get rid of her in the next election ? 
  most food is wasted before it even enters your home , such as expired produce in a supermarket or loss due to not following protocols for hygienic and food safety reasons , as far as i am aware . 
   oversized beer i 'm sorry , i do n't understand . 
   in addition to . 
  maybe i am particularly slow today , but what will that then look like ? 
  i 'll have * one * vote for any list , either national or european , or i 'll have * two * votes one european , one national ? 
  in the first case , can a party submit * both * national and european lists or only * either * ? 
  in the latter , what are these two votes for ? 
    council  which rules of appointment ? 
  it 's the assembly of heads of state/gov ` t. . that * is * a rule of appointment . 
  in my opinion it is not very well chosen , because the collective heads of government/state should not have * legislative * powers when they were elected to * govern * . 
  i have the exact same criticism of the german * bundesrat * . 
  while there is nothing wrong with the national parliaments , that is the * legislative * bodies sending a representative , there is something weird about having * executive * bodies to legislate . 
   creation of a cross-border joint european constituency , in which lists are headed by each political family 's nominee for the post of president of the commission . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  would that be in * addition * to the national lists or would the national lists be abolished ? 
  also the council needs to be reformed , both its public image and the rules of appointment . 
  [ may this whole map turn green ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eu_ftas.svg ) . 
  it 's not that particularly uncommon ? 
  besides , there is room left around it , maybe more stuff will be added later . 
  how is the speaker of the upper house in germany undemocratic ? 
  at best it is `` 3/4 '' since the upper house elects/appoints one to be the speaker . 
  similarly , switzerland scores very well . 
  they also have a system of private insurers with state insurance for long-term care . 
  oh the horror of direct democracy with uninformed voters . 
  thank you for showing this . 
   we did a lot of progress . 
  a lot . 
  romania was basically an agrarian state . 
  a large part of the population still lives on subsistence , at least statistically speaking . 
  now you are leading in internet connection speeds within europe and compete with countries like south korea and japan . 
  that by itself speaks volumes . 
  are there problems ? 
  sure !, 
  the ability of the romanian people to cope with them , all those problems from the times of communism to the darker aspects of capitalism are the material of a prelude to a great future . 
  the story of romania in the twentyfirst century is the story of european cooperation : western capital and eastern ingenuity . 
  over a surprisingly short timespan there was an extraordinary - in any sense of the word - time of progress that we expect to continue in virtually all aspects of society . 
  an extraordinary process of improvement we seek to achieve in the devoloped economies of the west , i might add . 
  after decades of stagnation and seeing where the west is at , i can understand that there is a significant amount of frustrations - there certainly was and still is when eastern germany re-entered germany proper - yet work does not always progress as fast as we wish it to . 
  the rewards will still be the same . 
   germany is a large country , their total population is as big as poland , czechia , slovakia , hungary , romania , estonia , latvia and lithuania , combined . 
  i get [ 92m people ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+estonia+latvia+lithuania+poland+czechia+slovakia+hungary+romania ) for eastern europe , but only [ 82m people ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+germany ) for germany . 
  maybe if we pull a [ anschluss ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+germany+%2b+austria ) but then we 're still short 2m . 
  i am happy to see that the eu is negotiating [ a lot of free trade agreements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) , becoming a trading super power . 
  of course , these treaties are a consequence of the doha talks failing , which would have seen global free trade . 
  maybe one day there will be another attempt . 
  there is no `` winter time '' , only dst and normal time , the latter of which is defined such that the sun reaches its highest point at 12:00 on average . 
  nature does n't care what our clocks say , the sun will rise and rest at the same actual time , regardless of what we tell our clocks to say . 
  changing clock time so `` that it gets dark later '' is like changing the thermometer reading so `` that it is warmer in my room . '', 
  and it makes the map look nicer . 
  we 'll have four systems to choose from : us american , eu , russian and chinese . 
  and to appease the people that ca n't negotiate seasonal work times . 
  according to that map and some eyeballing , france and benelux could also benefit from switching , preferably at the same time . 
  easter europe seems well placed , except for belarus . 
  all the islands , that is azores , madeira , canaries , iceland , could also move by one time zone each . 
  and then there 's russia . 
  while you 're at it , stop the daylight saving time nonsense like russia and turkey did . 
  thank you !, 
  i get confused about what projects are blocked by the national governments , sorry . 
  plain and simply , no . 
  it is up to the country 's constitution and most allow joining without any referendum taking place . 
   the three prime ministers of latvia , latvia and estonia [ ... ] they should better proof read their articles . 
  anyhow , if we ca n't get a unified european energy market rolling , then regional initiatives like this have to form the basis of future cooperation . 
  those barbarians . 
  what 's that now ? 
  more tunnels at similar scale ? 
  [ all of them , except cdu ] ( https://www.mehr-demokratie.de/volksentscheid-bundestag.html ) . 
  [ all parties except the cdu support referenda ] ( https://www.mehr-demokratie.de/volksentscheid-bundestag.html ) . 
  [ because only the cdu is against referenda ] ( https://www.mehr-demokratie.de/volksentscheid-bundestag.html ) . 
  because the swiss model is superior to the german one . 
  if you want the system to be different , that is even more reason for you to apply . 
  that way you have an actual chance at changing it . 
  my only wish is that cdu does n't get enough votes to block a constitutional change to introduce popular referenda . 
  within germany the tax is paid to the * bundesland * where the beer is produced , somehow that works for us . 
  although i agree that it needs to be replaced by a sales tax , production taxes are just bureucratic evil . 
  it 's a real shame for most things that there is no single market for it .
