  for all of geostrategic , political , financial and prestige reasons . 
   the main advantage of corporate tax is that who the cost falls in is so opaque that most voters think it 's paid for by someone else . 
  i do n't think that 's a good thing . 
  hell , people do n't understand the difference between which person receives the receipt for the tax and who it impacts . 
  for example in germany pension , unemployment and health insurance are paid equally by the employee and the business , yet many people seem to be incapable to understand that it is irrelevant to their employer what they call these items , it 's all just `` cost '' to them . 
  which is why i am such a fan of putting all social insurance on the employee 's receipt , the vat , land value tax and personal income tax . 
  at the same time i am an opponent of all excise taxes and everything that does n't show up close to the individual citizen . 
  that way people might see how much we are really taxed and think about whether they get their money 's worth . 
  oh this is my lucky day , the * fourth * comment against corporate taxes . 
   krugman said once that there is an inverse murphy 's law for economists . 
  they get all the attention on issues they know nothing about , and are simply ignored when they all agree . 
  this seems to be the fate of many experts . 
  small classrooms is another one . 
  many education researchers are skeptical whether they are at all cost effective , yet everybody campaigns on making classrooms smaller . 
  with economics the problem certainly seems to be worse , but now that you mention it , every profession has topics like these . 
  i recall reading that experts in crime do n't particularly favour extremely harsh sentencing in general and for drug crime in particular . 
  but yeah , that is why i 'd love to read a compilation of professional opinions like these to gauge whether i should be as confident in my beliefs - that is do the experts agree - or whether i should be more skeptical - when they disagree with me or say that there is mixed evidence . 
   [ ... ] , and this is one of these ineffective measures that is hugely popular . 
  what , lowering corporate tax or increasing it ? 
  because increasing it seems to be the more popular choice . 
   rent caps is another one . 
  virtually all economists oppose it , every politician loves it . 
  i wonder whether there is a list of nearly universal opinions among economists that are not implemented . 
  for example free trade has a near 100 % support . 
  you know what ? 
  i want a list like that for all professions , just to see how glaring the disconnect is between expert opinion , public opinion and politics . 
  what is this ? 
  three comments against the corporate income tax within one thread ? 
  usually i get downvoted to hell when i propose eliminating the corporate income tax due to its inefficiency in fulfilling any of its purported goals . 
  also the combination of increased capital gains tax and reduced corporate tax is kind of genius : it reduces the tax burden for foreign investors , since those do not pay capital gains tax in france , only corporate tax . 
  at the same time , with higher capital gains tax and lower corporate tax the french investor has more incentive to let his profits roll , as capital gains tax is only paid when the profit is distributed , not if it is reinvested within the company . 
   `` eu to have new members after brexit - ** likely ** balkan states '' the * only * candidate states are balkan states . 
  turkey is now out of the question and iceland almost certainly wo n't continue membership talks . 
   `` many refer to this process as enlargement , but i prefer to talk about it as the ** reunification of europe ** , '' said she . 
  when was europe ever unified ? 
  the roman empire came close , the holy roman empire did well , the ottomanns tried , as did napoleon and hitler . 
  no one succeeded so far , even though many tried to realize their vision of a unified europe through blood and steel . 
  maybe we 'll succeed with diplomacy this time . 
  there is still a lot of work to be done , though . 
  even beyond the internal division and problems of the eu , for the potential new member states , the kosovo conflict needs to be resolved , bosnia and herzegovina needs a functioning constitution , the transnistria conflict needs to be resolved , belarus needs a modern democracy , as does russia . 
  the ukraine conflict needs to be resolved and its government thouroughly cleaned of corruption . 
  greece needs to drop the naming issue with macedonia . 
  yeah , there is a lot of work to be done . 
  i would n't discount hong kong , singapore , japan , korea , australia and the non-eu members norway and switzerland . 
  of course the united states , too , depending on the state . 
  personally i think that there is a lot to learn from both norway and switzerland . 
  while we do not have the same ressource wealth as norway and the same peaceful history of switzerland , the way those societies are run are plenty interesting and useful lessons for how we move the eu and its constituent countries forward . 
  to be fair , france has [ one of the highest corporate income tax rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_tax#international_corporate_tax_rates ) in the world . 
  only one higher is none other than the us , which goes to show that corporate tax has very little to do with income equality . 
  estonia has an interesting version of corporate tax , as they only tax * distributed * profits , as opposed to yearly profit . 
  you can also deduct the taxes paid on distributed profit from your income tax . 
  some economists even oppose the corporate income tax altogether , as it is kind of redundant if you already have vat and much easier to dodge . 
  what is this eurozone budget supposed to finance ? 
   fuck the corporation tax . 
  thank you . 
  [ some economists oppose the corporate income tax altogether ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/opinion/abolish-the-corporate-income-tax.html ) . 
  it does n't really make sense to me to have vat taxing value added and profits on top . 
  corporations do not have income , people do . 
  corporations are merely legally fictional wrappers . 
  estonia does have corporate income tax , but they only tax profits distributed to shareholders , not profits reinvested . 
  strangely their economy is still working . 
  even so , you can deduct the taxes paid on profits from your individual income tax , if you are a resident . 
   after all , corporate taxes are a roundabout way to tax the rich . 
  why not just tax the rich instead ? 
  tax land value , tax value added regardless of natural or legal person , tax incomes above 100k $ , distribute basic income in the form of a negative income tax for lower income individuals , add pigovian taxes to taste . 
  this should be a thing for all our border states : having the neighbouring country 's official or regional language as option for first foreign language in school . 
  this is especially in line with the loose eu goal of having everyone speak three union languages . 
  we 'd be learning dutch , french , danish , polish and czech . 
  also when i did the research , the small kegs not requiring extra equipment are more expensive than buying the exact same brand in bottles . 
  i 'd like to be proven wrong , however . 
  the irony of common sense is that it is not common at all . 
  germany did try to attack switzerland . 
  i think you are misunderstanding my general point : democracies generally do not start wars and try not to participate in wars , they try diplomacy . 
  defensive action is not the same as a war of aggression . 
  so the argument goes the other way around , compare with japan : it was n't a democracy by any measure , strategically isolated like switzerland , but started a war of aggression . 
  i am arguing that had japan been a democracy they had n't started or joined a useless war , * where they could have chosen otherwise * . 
  maybe if your neighbours had a strong tradition of democracy and rule of law , like switzerland , it had n't come to war in the first place ? 
  ch 's position in the mountains gives them the option not to participate in war and they took the chance . 
  with another mentality or another regime , they might have joined the war . 
  i do n't know why people do n't want to get this in their heads . 
  switzerland is the richest , not ressource-based country in the world because of strong democracy and small government . 
  not because of their banking system alone , they are leading in multiple fields of science and industry , and not participating in major wars in recent history is because of strong democracy . 
  there are so many things to learn from switzerland , like system of government for the eu , direct democracy , social security , economic freedom and diplomacy just to name a few . 
  i do n't give crap about france reforming , we need a reform of the european union . 
   do we protect the elevator operators , too ? 
  any white collar worker who was a victim of excel ? 
  the builders of horse carriages , horse breeders and the people that feed them . 
  the manual weavers . 
  the whalers that hunt whales for their oil in lamps . 
  the calculators and drawers that calculate and draw for engineers and scientists . 
  the ox breeders for the oxen plowing the fields . 
  the night 's ladies waking people up in the morning , so they are not late . 
  the scribes that wrote the books . 
  the painters that painted them . 
  and countless more . 
  jobs have been lost in the past and new ones turned up in the past . 
  the future will be the same . 
  it is not as if most of these job losses were n't a long time coming . 
  you can do both , you know . 
  having both the best products in the world and also the best image/marketing .
