  the more i read on this sub the more i want to see of this continent and its cultures . 
  travel puts significant stress on a purse and usually travel by train is cheaper than say travel with a car . 
  and the rail baltica and the scandinavian rail thread got me thinking . 
  in germany we have the `` bahncard 100 '' allowing to travel with any train in germany in second class for 4.090 $ p.a. 
  and free fare on all local public transport such as busses . 
  there are however other cards , such as the bahncard 50 and bahncard 25 offering 50 % and 25 % discount on any fare for 249 $ p.a. 
  61 p.a. 
  respectively . 
  these offer free fare only at destinations at least 100km away from your residence and only to your target destination . 
  in europe we have the interrail global pass with access to all eu countries except the baltics ( and for obvious reasons malta and cyprus ) further including norway , serbia , bosnia , montenegro , fyrom , turkey . 
  as far as i know , no local transport is included . 
  a 2nd class pass for an adult over 25 years of age is 658 $ p.m. with unlimited free travel comparable to the offering above . 
  this equals 7896 $ p.a. 
  no similar rebate schemes as with the bahncard are offered . 
  i am not sure what i want to convey . 
  i think we can do better , having more flexible , more affordable , more european rail tickets . 
  the * reiselust * got to me .
