  canada recently signed a fta with eu and is waiting for ratification by the provinces and states respectively . 
  the eu is currently negotiating with the us a fta though this meets resistence . 
  i want to provide some perspective on the necessity of this agreement or at least a similar one . 
  first note that the current international phenomenon of dozens and dozens of negotiations for ftas are part of the fallout of collapsed [ doha talks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doha_development_round ) that would have seen global free trade . 
  the current regime then is the next-best solution to the clear goal of global free trade . 
  we take a look at south east asia where we have major economic growth and three major economic players : india , china and the ( free trade ) association of 10 countries , [ asean ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asean ) . 
  the latter has ftas with china , australia , new zealand , japan , south korea and has largely concluded negotiations with india . 
  as the other participating countries have with a few exceptions agreements with each other , participants in this web seek to create an [ all-encompassing agreement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comprehensive_economic_partnership_for_east_asia ) . 
  this agreement would create a giant single market , encompassing * three billion people * with a combined gdp comparable to the eu . 
  considering their huge economic growth rate this hypothetical agreement could dominate global trade in the near future . 
  taking a look to the west we see that in north america [ nafta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nafta ) is strong and kicking . 
  the participating countries are each others largest trade partner and have with the exception of the usa free trade agreements with the eu and the efta . 
  in europe again we have the eu , the eea and switzerland ( the latter together form efta ) which together form the greatest single market in the world . 
  tying together the above we can talk about the possibility of a [ transatlantic free trade area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tafta ) encompassing all states of nafta , efta and the eu . 
  this hypothetical agreement could contain over * one billion people * and more than * half of the world 's current gdp * . 
  assuming an agreement of this kind raises the gdp of all participating countries or at least the gdp of all participants combined , we can ensure by this that global economic power remains concentrated in the west . 
  long-term this hypothetical tafta body should strive to include all of [ unasur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unasur ) , mesoamerica and the [ arab states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arab_league ) . 
  obviously within this argument the states of asean , india , china , etc. 
  should be included .

  [ spain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spain ) is one of the last monarchies in europe and the last monarchy in our series . 
  historically a major colonial power it exported its language to the americas where it dominates together with other european languages . 
  home to various local cultures it is not a nation state in the french sense but a state of nations .

  [ france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/france ) is is the largest country by area in the eu . 
  they shaped european history like few other countries and were one of the first countries to get rid of a royal government in europe .

  their language is still a major export product and their country name is a sign of quality in culinary matters .

  [ germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany ) is called home by yours truly . 
  while other countries maintain a complicated history too , it is an ancient trope of germany to wonder what it means to be german . 
  a powerhouse at the center of europe it was the major player in both world wars and the perpetrator of major war crimes . 
  national identity suffers from that time , shadowing the major successes of its citizens , from the reformation , the printing press with moving letters to x-rays and the relativity theory . 
  so what do you know about germany ?

  in germany we have no ( binding ) referenda on the federal level but the spd tries to intruduce them into the current government . 
  which made me wonder , what are the laws in other countries of europe and does anyone want to make a map about that ?

  [ russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia ) is the largest country by land mass by far . 
  it is situated on two continents appropriately called the european and asian part . 
  the european part alone controls 40 % of the european continent and is home to over 100 million citizens . 
  this alone makes it the largest country in europe . 
  though quite poor , russia is one of the most powerful entities in the world , host to the largest city entirely in europe , moscow , and a rich history . 
  it is not quite european and not quite asian leading people to call it the eigtth continent . 
  so what do you know about russia ? 
  no more installments as this is the last .

  main questions in the title . 
  i enjoyed the series very much . 
  it started when i read an article about armenia and realised i know next to nothing about them . 
  so i set out to learn about all of the european countries and wanted you to join in . 
  this then became the series as you know it . 
  i included some countries not everyone considers european to be sure to capture all european countries . 
  my source was the wikipedia list of european countries which most definitely includes border cases such as kazakhstan . 
  no regrets . 
  if anyone has the patience , they could do some statistics on the upvotes and comments to evaluate which countries were most discussed or liked though this measure will surely be quite confounded by any number of unrelated factors . 
  do you want to see any more series like these ?
