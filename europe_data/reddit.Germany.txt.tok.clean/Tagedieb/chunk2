  there are many possible interpretations for the word republic . 
  the [ wikipedia page of republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic ) only mentions the term `` head of state '' in it 's second half , so i would argue none of the most widely accepted interpretations differentiate primarily on the head of state . 
  sure , in the uk the definition of `` being a republican '' probably is close to `` being against monarchy '' . 
  is the same true for the ( modern ) [ us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republicanism_in_the_united_states#new_deal_era_to_present ) ? 
  is the same true for ( modern ) [ germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republikaner ) and [ france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republican_party_%28france%29 ) ? 
  good question . 
  but east germany was called `` german democratic republic '' and you could argue that it was n't really a republic and certainly was n't democratic at all . 
  so maybe the authors were thinking just calling something a republic does n't make it a republic . 
  but i surely would like to know the reasoning behind it , if that 's the case . 
  how did you determine that value ? 
  is that newsworthy ? 
   nobody would bat an eye if the customer accepts change . 
  i think that might be the difference between expected and common . 
  i have never been to finland , but i could also say for germany that `` nobody would bet an eye if you accept change '' , still it is quite common to tip . 
  well , in germany we have isps who will sell broadband internet connection to elderly people who do n't even have a computer or any other means of making use of it . 
  makes me wonder why we are n't higher up in the stats . 
  they do , you just ca n't hear them . 
  fact : later you can find their shit , even if you did n't witness the act . 
  would be interesting to see the number of international tourists from countries * outside europe * to europe . 
  obviously what i know from her case is just what i heard/read in the media . 
  but according to that those `` best doctors from germany '' determined that she is ( was ) indeed sick and not fit for trial . 
  they wanted to take her to germany for treatment ( she feared that doctors in ukraine would infect her on purpose during the treatment ) . 
  that was denied , even when the german government got involved ( which i guess would have been happy to guarantee that she would be returned after the treatment ) . 
  now you have to understand : we do n't hear a lot about ukraine in the media . 
  so when the news came , that the former prime minister is in trial and will probably be jailed , the first thought always is that this is a political thing . 
  with berlusconi it is different . 
  he and his crimes were visible in our media all the time and we saw time and time again how he evaded justice . 
  maybe this is also the picture you have of tymoshenko and maybe that is even correct . 
  what i want to say : maybe you are right . 
  maybe it makes no sense to have different opinions about the two cases when you know all the facts . 
  but we do n't know all the facts and we form opinions from what is reported to us ( just like you probably do ) . 
  this is an excellent question worth discussing . 
  not because i think there is no difference . 
  first of all `` the people here '' are n't the eu . 
  there is no official reaction yet from the eu and berlusconi ( unlike tymoschenko ) probably wo n't ask the eu for help . 
  now for the question , why the european public might have different opinions in the two cases : i think the real reason is that berlusconi was already under investigation for several crimes while he was in power . 
  he made laws to protect himself , etc. 
  now that he lost some of it , he will get house arrest , which is n't a big punishment . 
  tymoshenko to my knowledge was n't investigated when she was in power . 
  the things she is accused of seems to either be new stuff when she left office or old things that were already dismissed by courts before she even took office . 
  also she is very sick and was denied proper medical treatment . 
  she does n't have the luxury of house arrest . 
  even if what she is accused of is true , the treatment she gets seems to be especially tough and it seems to be specificly because she became an opposition figure . 
  now the two cases might be more similar than some think ( maybe they are both guilty ) , but at least the treatment berlusconi gets is much different from the treatment tymoshenko gets . 
  do you think she was at any point or is now able to make such a public statement about what she percieves as injustice , like berlusconi just did ? 
   who actually is in charge does n't matter as much as in , say , germany , where one or two parties can more or less do what they want . 
  except the bundesverfassungsgericht stops them ... 
  it 's not quite so simple , because laws that have to pass the bundesrat can be stopped even when the two big parties want to pass it unanimously . 
  but in general you are right . 
   what you gon na do in oh-so-democratic germany ? 
  :p hehe, 
  even more : if you do n't vote , you have already lost . 
  how come the oh-so-democratic switzerland has such a low turnout ? 
   `` a country without a secret service would be too vulnerable . '', 
  to what ? 
  i really want to know , angela !, 
  to nazi terrorists killing people throughout the country over many years ? 
  or are the secrect services just not powerful enough for such a thing ? 
  one thing seems obvious : a secret service might be necessary for * something * , but certainly not for the safety of the citizens . 
  i hear police officers in northern ireland fear for their live . 
   it also messes extensively with the market so does ( potentially to an even bigger extent ) a basic income . 
  in fact every social policy does . 
  the big question there is if the benefits outweigh the costs and problems attached . 
  and you do n't know before you try . 
  and i do n't mean try in a completely different country in totally different socioeconomic circumstances and with a totally different political system . 
  * [ :\\ ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x_ot0k4xjc ), 
   you call it organic ... we just call it * food . 
  * the first thing that comes to my mind when i think about `` netherlands '' , `` food '' and `` organic '' is the eggs from battery cages that are always marked as coming from the netherlands . 
  but i think they are banned now throughout the eu , which must be a major problem for egg producers in the netherlands . 
  well , not to rain on their parade , but earth itself is inaccurate enough , so that you would still have to adjust for a variable amount of [ leap seconds ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leap_second ) every year . 
  unlike the leap year , it ca n't be derived from a simple rule , but it has to be measured all the time . 
  it 's much better than most clocks we have now , often loosing a second of accuracy every few days , but an atomic clock does already have the `` wrong time '' ( if you want to be in sync with the rest of the world ) after a year , not a few thousand years . 
  now with the gps situation it certainly helps , because once the clock is synchronized with the satellites ' clocks , you need only three instead of four satellites to calculate your position . 
  there are no special hate crime laws . 
  she will ( or wo n't ) be charged for murder or assisting with murder or maybe being member of a terrorist group , i guess . 
  so you have police beating up asylum seekers , and you blame austerity ? 
  wow , alaska has the land area of spain , france , germany and poland combined , but the population of luxembourg ( well , a little more , but not much ) . 
  same for [ germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nature_parks_in_germany ) . 
  and most other countries i 'm sure . 
  more of this , europe !, 
  is the modding activity of one mod visible to the other mods of a subreddit ? 
  if yes , do mods take the time to find out if what other mods are doing is justified ? 
  die linke was formed by fusion of pds and wasg . 
  pds literally is the communist party that ruled eastern germany . 
  wasg was formed after an ugly internal fight in the spd over schr\u00f6der 's agenda 2010 . 
  even though there is a growing group of people in the spd willing to ease on that topic , the people involved still do n't trust each other . 
  you ca n't just try to appeal to only one side of the current party system , you have to appeal to the whole spectrum , otherwise you virtually have no chance at all to reach 5 % . 
  so your program has to be fuzzy . 
  there are euro-sceptics basically in all of the current parties ( though they are a minority in most if not all ) . 
  both the pirates and the afd until now have tried to make the impression that they are neither left nor right . 
  my guess is that mostly fdp , some cdu and linke , and only few of the other parties will vote for afd . 
   i would get the needed seats another austrian who wants to rule germany ? 
  no , thanks . . 
  that 's nice . 
  in europe we unfortunately have some ghettoization in many countries ( mostly by choice ) . 
  there are kindergardens and primary schools where mostly immigrants ' kids are on , urban districts where mostly people of one nationality live , etc. 
  add to that , that most people living in germany ( for example ) have there entire ancestry as far as they can trace back living in germany or one of its direct neighbor countries . 
  the question ` where do your ancestors come from ' would again divide an average school class in two groups . 
  unless your surname sounds french ( for example ) , most kids from families that came to ( what is now ) germany 200 years ago would n't even know that . 
  add to that the practice of changing your surname when migrating that was often used in european history , and there is an even more clear divide between these and those .
