  * 8 : over 80 % so , if that is the case , they seem to be missing 20 % . 
  first of all , the argument * was * a genetic one , not a demographic one . 
  second of all , dark-haired ( or dark-skinned ) people getting more kids does not kill or make blond people ( or dark-haired people that carry a recessive `` blond gene '' ) get fewer kids . 
  do you even know , what a recessive allele is ? 
  then tell me , how big is the percentage in southern england ? 
  please , let 's please not do this !, 
  i beg you !, 
  would be interesting to know what the shades mean . 
  you must confuse europe with a continent that does n't want shit to get done . 
  the history books are written by the victors , always . 
  i do n't complain though , because the end result is still much better than the nazis being successful and rewriting history . 
  the fact is that most countries were a lot more nationalistic than they are now , including the us . 
  they could not have cared less about the jews in fact and only entered the war in europe , when nazi germany seemed to have succesfully reorganized the continent . 
  other than that , the us was quite open to nazi retoric . 
  the ecb is doing what a [ central bank ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_bank ) is supposed to do . 
  but that normally does n't include financing the government , because that would sacrifice its independence . 
   the journalist , however , is not supposed to side with one of those opinions . 
  who says that ? 
  the journalist is even * required * to do so , in order to create a real discussion . 
  what good is an interview that tries to ignore doubts and questions , the readers might have ? 
  in the interest of brevity it is very common to omit the words `` there are those who think , that ... '' from a question . 
  of course , there might also be readers who do n't understand the structure an interview has , and think there is a good and a bad side , instead of an exchange of arguments for two rivaling opinions . 
  but even those readers get the chance to read both sides of the story . 
  so , i do n't get the problem . 
  opinion pieces are a different thing . 
  and it could be argued , that they are not balanced enough for both sides . 
  just today [ der spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/aufruf-von-50-prominenten-europaeern-gebt-griechenland-mehr-zeit-a-835821.html ) reported about an appeal to [ give greece more time ] ( http://savetheeuro.wordpress.com/ ) to do what they need to do . 
  discussing the exact balance this is a moot thing , as it takes away attention for the topic itself . 
  on the contrary , that is more or less a standard question for politicians and heads of struggling companies . 
  of course there is the implication in the question , that this is hard to do . 
  but since many people really * do * have those doubts , it is good to also let them shine through in discussions like these . 
  and as i said , doing this in an interview gives the interviewee the ability to directly address them . 
   another interpretation is that by causing him to be continually on the defensive he 's given no chance to really expand on his positions . 
  considering that the follow-up question is `` how do you propose to do that ? 
  '' , it 's hard to imagine that they do n't want to give him chance to defend his positions . 
  that 's how interviews work : the more you argue against the interviewee , the more you are giving him the chance to really defend his position . 
  the journalists have no agenda of their own other than creating an interesting and informative interview . 
  they just ask questions that many have about syriza . 
   it is nonetheless the desire of every state ( or its ruler ) to achieve lasting peace by thus dominating the whole world , if at all possible . 
  but nature wills it otherwise , and uses two means to separate the nations and prevent them from intermingling -- linguistic and religious differences . 
  these may certainly occasion mutual hatred and provide pretexts for war , but as culture grows and men gradually move towards greater agreement over their principles , they lead to mutual understanding and peace . 
    * immanuel kant , perpetual peace , a philosophical sketch , 1796 * a common language facilitates peace and peace facilitates world domination . 
  so let 's outsmart our rulers by not having a common language and war instead , so that they do n't dominate us . 
  flawless logic . 
   because of linguistic imperialism what does that even mean ? 
   i am not entirely sure , but i think that spanish have more speakers than english [ not in europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_in_the_european_union#knowledge ) [ and worldwide , it 's a close tie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers ) ( regarding native speakers ), 
  you assume , that investment is generally better than consumption for the economy . 
  i would say it depends on the current status of the economy . 
  consumption does not need to create profit , because it does not need to be payd back like investment ( which , btw , can only happen when people comsume ), 
  christian wulff got [ $ 152400 a year when he was minister president of lower saxony ] ( http://www.gehaltsreport.de/people/552/employments/614 ) . 
  that was n't enough , is what you say ? 
  the article seems to contradict itself . 
   until now , ministers ' wages have been set relative to those of civil servants . 
  i strongly doubt that civil servants did n't get raises for 12 years . 
  but maybe i 'm wrong . 
  if survival is the only objective , then most countries around the world are doing well . 
  yes , thinking and debating is what we have done for years now . 
  i think he is right , though . 
  the problem is , that we lack strong political figures that make bold statements and go forward , even when there are risks . 
  we are always fast to criticize former politicians that went ahead and created the euro despite unsolved problems and risks . 
  but in reality there are no risk-free ventures . 
  if you want to get stuff done , sometimes you just have to `` create facts '' . 
  that is btw . 
  how a lot of very good institutions we now value have been created . 
  and yet , the government deficit reported for 2011 in % of gdp were : - [ germany : 1.0 % ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesamtwirtschaftumwelt/vgr/inlandsprodukt/tabellen/einausstaat.html ) - [ usa : 8.6 % ] ( http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_2007_2017usp_xxs1li111mcn_g0f ) - [ ireland : 9.9 % ] ( http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0cgaqfjad&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ft.com%2fcms%2fs%2f0%2f18b405ec-3704-11e1-96bf-00144feabdc0.html&amp;ei=_twgt4eyl8xn4qswxighcq&amp;usg=afqjcnhq3cokyhu0fvcyxhxcdsvrk5vnya&amp;sig2=2gcndfd7gecqd8awhz-oja ), 
  it has n't changed much . 
  still not enough kindergardens , especially in the west . 
  i think that for very long time it was possible to have a single income for a family and a `` stay at home '' mom . 
  thats starting to change rapidly now . 
  now instead of building new kindergardens we have a conservative government that wants to pay stay-at-home mothers , which is really backwards . 
  you are right , that is almost exactly the time ... now if you excuse me , i have to go get my sports almanach and place some bets . 
  liquid democracy still allows for delegates . 
  just that you can pull out the mandate at any time . 
  there is not much difference between rise and growth in this context . 
  the problem with austerity is , that it is so hard to predict the future : will the burden of a bad credit standing be harder or the burden of the results of austerity ? 
  i think it is important to make the decision in every area that austerity is applied : does doing this hurt more than debts in the long run ? 
  but austerity can also mean that you check the areas where you spend money , if there is any possibility to do the same with less money , i.e. 
  to be more efficient . 
  often this is possible , but requires some extra upfront investment . 
  the problem is , that it is so hard to get a good ( and honest ) overview about why money has been spend . 
  who knows how many tax evaders we have ? 
  who knows how many dead people get pensions ? 
  and above all , who really knows if banks could easily save themself if they would apply some austerity of their own ? 
  just speculating , but since its an island with a small population it could have to do with a limited gene pool which promotes genetic diseases . 
  that guy has a super elastic nose . 
  maybe he 's an alien . 
  '' * it means `` lazyness is the engine of progress . '', 
  why does an engineer innovate ? 
  because he finds it annoying and boring to do recurring manual work . 
  the president in germany has a history of speaking more * to * the germans , not so much * for * the germans ( which is the job of the ministry of foreign affairs or maybe the chancellery ) . 
  it 's very clear , that both the industry and the buyer benefit from subsidies . 
  that does n't make the headline wrong . 
  i do n't really know the exact reason , but i guess it is so that people do n't do tactical voting based on the partial results . 
  we still have a problem with our voting system in germany , where under certain circumstances a small number of votes could have a `` nagative weight '' . 
  it has to do with the dual nature of the system , and how this is solved . 
  appearantly it is very hard to design a system that is not too different from our current system and does n't have this effect . 
  our constitutional court ordered the government to fix it , and the fixed system still has a similar problem . 
  so , in theory it could be possible to do tactical voting , especially if you know the partial results , to have more influence on the result than you ought to have . 
  right , but if there are several votes each second , then you ca n't verify much anymore ( for example if your vote has been combined with someone elses , who voted the same in at the same time ) . 
  many voting systems require that the counting or at least the publishing of the results ( and even publishing of projections based on partial results ) does not take place before the official voting is over .
