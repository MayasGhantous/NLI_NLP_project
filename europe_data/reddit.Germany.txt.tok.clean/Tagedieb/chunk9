  the demand is going to come from the running income ( which will not go away ) . 
  you wo n't have growth in times of austerity , but growth is only needed , when you run up too many debts . 
  we have an incredibly much higher worker productivity than 100 years ago , in every single eu country , so we should be able to feed our families and have everything we need . 
  we have to watch where our money goes and make sure it fulfills its purpose . 
  we have to prioritize our efforts to areas that help . 
  if you have enough money to have growth , even in the deepest crisis , it would be considered a waste of energy and resource to optimize and prioritize your efforts . 
  and in countries , where there is much room for optimization , this could maybe even produce growth , even in times of austerity . 
  but since eternal growth for everyone is a myth , a crisis is a good exercise for the times , where will have exploited all our resources , are not able to significantly improve our productivity anymore , etc. 
  to start thinking about how a sustainable future without long term growth can look like . 
  btw . 
  austerity does not mean we all get our budgets balanced in times of crisis . 
  that would be a dream , even for germany . 
  it just means that you bring your new debts in times of crisis to a level that is possible to at least partly pay back after the crisis . 
  the german version in the basic law implies afaik symmetrical budgets between recession and growth , which means we have to have the same amount of surplus in times of growth as the missing money in recessions . 
  but i do n't expect that to ever happen . 
  what are they shouting in the beginning ? 
  what do the signs say ? 
  ( i ca n't make them out from that video ) i did n't watch the whole 16 minutes , because the filming angle did n't change much , and the signs were to small/it was too dark to see what they say . 
  i mean for all i know , they could be protesting acta amoung other stuff ( meaning possibly most of them were there for the other stuff ) , or even only other stuff . 
   in short , my trust in government , historians , scientists , historic documents , media ( collectively i 'll call it evidence ) is not broken . 
  well , then there should be enough evidence for everyone to know absolutely for sure that `` it is n't a hoax '' . 
  it is a fallacy and only then a fallacy , if there are strong and few links from a to b. 
  here is why : by saying it is a `` slippery slope '' without stating what the links from a to b might be , you make a statement without substance , while trying to make the impression it has substance . 
  if there are few and likely steps from a to b , you do n't have to name them , because they are obvious . 
  but in your case they are not . 
  you know , we have a lot of countries banning similar kind of speech for a long time now . 
  still they did n't `` slip '' on their `` slippery slope '' . 
  there is no country on earth that i know of that does not ban any kind of speech at all . 
  example , if i hire a killer using speech only i am still guilty and can go to jail , in every country afaik . 
  edit : sorry , the first sentence should read : `` it * no * fallacy and only then * no * fallacy , if there are strong and few links from a to b. '', 
   ** invariably ** [ \u026an\u02c8v\u025b\u0259r\u026a\u0259bl\u026a ]   * adv *   always ; without exception   collins english dictionary -- complete and unabridged \u00a9 harpercollins publishers 1991 , 1994 , 1998 , 2000 , 2003 [ source ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/invariably ) i hope that explains it . 
  ** if ** the number of steps is low , and their connection is strong , ** then ** it is not a fallacy . 
  the difference ( between holocaust and creation ) is : if it were all lies , then everyone with first hand experience of those events should have exclaimed about the lies . 
  and it is hard to silence millions of people to a point where nobody later even finds evidence of * that * happening . 
  creation has been dated back to a time when people did n't write , and did n't even for a lot of generations after that . 
  so there is no way that anyone could have made out the exclamation of lies being told by first hand experience . 
  so the number of steps is low and the causal strength of their connections are strong in this specific case , is what you are saying ? 
    but it is utterly , utterly mental to deny the systematic extermination of millions upon millions of civilians by the nazis because they were jewish , gay or whatever . 
   how do you know it is n't a hoax ? 
  because you were told by authority ? 
  how do you know if what you have experienced first hand yourself really happened ? 
  because someone could have meddled with your brain , or you could be in the matrix ... how do you know , that what your grandparents tell you about their experience in the past is true ? 
  it could be the government forcing them to lie !, 
  how do you know , if anything you learn at school is true ? 
  how do you trust your own senses ? 
  someone could have done something to them !, 
  well , if your trust in your government , historians , scientists , historic documents , media , etc. 
  is so broken , then why do you even want to discuss laws ? 
  she is a green ? 
  well , then a sensible attitude in these matters can be expected . 
  especially since , right-wing extremists nowadays in germany lean much more to violence and even murder than left-wing extremists . 
  the biggest crimes left-wing extremists are doing at the moment is destroying property ( such as cars ) . 
  moreover there are no ( publicly ) known links between left-wing politicians and extremists , but there are on the right-wing . 
  yes , i guess norway is absolutely off the scale because of its oil . 
  and you are right , the fact that ( former ) east germany is on par with the uk is certainly an eye-opener . 
  maybe because food in germany is rediculously cheap . 
  stuff like tomatos or fresh milk is n't even comparable in prices between germany and norway . 
  well , the german technology news website heise.de has quite a community , and they are really active on the civil rights stuff . 
  i guess it was one of the most important ( if not the most important ) hub against web censoring in the last few years , when laws were considered to censor websites based on accusations of child pornography . 
  the parties themself have to have democratic structures . 
  also a single mep can not do a lot of harm , because every law needs a majority . 
  if a member of a party is too far away in his voting behaviour from the party line ( which itself is democraticly decided by party members on political conventions ) , then he will probably have a hard time getting on the list a second time . 
    parties put up lists , either national or state lists . 
  after the election , the first x % ( depending on the result ) are sent to the parliament . 
  standard party-list proportional representation , really . 
   how representative is that really ? 
  not much at all , if you ask me . 
  if you disagree , please offer reasons for why you consider it sufficiently representative . 
    not everyone sees it like that , so calling your way the only `` proper '' way is incredibly arrogant . 
   there are proper ways to choose representatives , and there are improper ones . 
  please explain why you consider the european way proper . 
  wow , sorry to chime in like that , but that is bullshit . 
  first of all , if * you * question something then * you * should also explain why , if you want to be taken seriously . 
  second , propertional representation makes a lot of sense , because otherwise a lot of votes are wasted . 
  for example in the uk elections , labour won 355 seats with 35.2 % of the votes , the conservatives won 198 seats with 32.4 % of the votes and the liberal democrats won 62 seats with 22.1 % of the votes . 
  now does that seem fair to you ? 
  yeah , but only literally . 
   minimum wage in spain : 641,1 $  minimum wage in italy : 1031 $  minimum wage in france : 1170 $  minimum wage in germany : 0 $ ftfy, 
  tax ! = regulation . 
  moreover , if the eu were the problem , then why do some countries in core eu still manufacture more than they even consume ? 
  is this not another example of trying to put the blame one someone else , because it 's convenient ( and in case of the uk , people will believe it without the slightest reservation ), 
  as as german , i feel the same . 
   part of a governments ability and willingness to repay its debts depends on whether it has its own currency , a country which can print money as it sees fit is more able to repay its debts than a country that can not . 
  when you speak of the debts of a country , you actually mean the debts of the government of that country . 
  but the fact is , that neither the us government , nor the german government ( for example ) before we had the euro can/could print money . 
  the concept of independend central banks is pretty widespread in democratic countries , especially for the reason , that the government should not destabilize the currency with its own spending behaviour . 
  i did n't mean so much the currencies , i was talking more about government bonds . 
  the fed like the ecb should be pretty independend from governments , so that it should be possible to rate a country without a need to rate the currency . 
  of course , you * also * need trust in a currency ( for example if the currency has a high inflation , you also need higher interest rates in return ) , but the main thing those agencies should be rating should be the governments ability and willingness to pay their debts . 
    does the usa still have aaa ratings from all of the three ? 
  right , i forgot this . 
  i was really baffled by the fact for months , that they did n't get downgraded , when it suddenly happened . 
   it tells more about the insecurity of all the other investment possibilities in the market . 
  not so sure about that . 
  our current government is really good in making itself look like the saviour of the world and making others look like shit . 
  that tactic has paid off for us in the medium term , enabling us to start paying off our own huge pile of debts . 
  but i am not sure what happens in the long run , because germany depends a lot on how our neighbors are doing . 
   did the aaa-rated germany just got a bunch of loans with negative interest ? 
  the ecb joined the feds strategy to give out cheap money ( we are on 1 % for a little over a month now ) . 
  the idea was to allow markets to have more money to invest in businesses and in bonds of countries that previously had high interest rates .
