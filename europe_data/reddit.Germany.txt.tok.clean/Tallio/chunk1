nope and i think when they have finished the investigations every other car manufacturer on this planet did this too . 
  oh ... missed the r because of oktoberfest i guess :d, 
  wow . . that 's some horrible serious shit :(, 
  babaria oh so true :d, 
  yeah we have no problem with you ~ ~ drunken vikings ~ ~ danes . 
  thing is : i watched german rtl news about the refugee crisis some 2 weeks ago and the reporter was live from the ... german-hungarian border anschluss anyone ? 
  i think he 's referring to the fuss the ukip makes about the influx in eu-immigration ( which is mainly from eastern europe ) to the uk . 
  / s well i do like the nice ~ ~ frogeaters ~ ~ french and the nice ~ ~ carthieves ~ ~ poles . . so no problem with ... neighbours , 
  oh it 's 800000 syrians now ? 
  interesting story twist , you got some more ahem . . `` facts '' to tell us ? 
  really ? 
  that story got told every time schengen got bigger ... oh look , the poles/slovakians/hungarians / etc come , they will work for less money than the germans do and take our jobs !, 
  ! 111oneeleven never happened , average wage never took a dent from that , why should it now ? 
  uhm actually it 's quite easy to explain . 
  2005 germany had a massive unemployment rate of over 11 % ( that 's 6-7 mio people i think , the late 90ies and early 2000 had unemployment rates around 10 % ) . 
  the quota is sinking since then , in the last years it 's stabilizing around 6-7 % . 
  the social and welfare state did n't collapse when the unemployment rate was nearly double as high as today . 
  do you really think the system will collapse because of the some-hundred-thousands asylum seekers this year ? 
  i do n't think so and i think most of them will work in the end . 
  yeah same method here in germany and we have linguists at work who confirm dialects etc from people , when they claim a certain homecountry . 
  wow , that 's a lot worser than cologne carnival ... 
  well yes , one babystep at a time ... 
  the eu does n't rush things ... 
  i would have preferred a complete package of solutions for the inner and outer causes as well , but this wo n't happen in 2015 i think . 
  well you know 100b sounds alot but let 's face it : only a fraction of this will be used for the actual camp building and provisioning , the rest will be lost in official and not-so-official channels . 
  it will be huge moneyparty when the eu just throws b over b of $ at certain countries in the middle east . 
  yeah and the `` pegida-movement '' failed horribly in every city and state except dresden and leipzig , so i do n't see the relevance of those few thousand for the whole country and it 's politics . . 
  oh yeah i forgot , vw cars are the only cars that pollute the environment . 
  yeah i read that , first i laughed , then i cried a little . 
  such incompetence, 
  well at least the cars did n't kill people like gms did . 
  true , 
  wow , offensive as fuck ... 
  and one of the reasons why the uk cries havoc about ( eu ) immigration ... ( which i find stupid , but each to their own ), 
  first is actually delicious too , 
   how is the eu going to be expected to distinguish between the migrants and the refugees when so many travel without identification and lie about why they 're there ? 
  i can only speak for germany and the handling of this in a german way , but `` we '' are using genuine syrian refugees and linguistic procedures to determine if somebody is from the country he claims to be ( in this case syria ) . 
  do n't know the details but it def . 
  works for people from the balkans and other countries claiming to be syrians . 
  maybe we are the hippie nazis from central europe ? 
  who knows ... , 
  except these people where from afghanistan and the balkans , 
  i do n't think they really meet on eye-level ... 
  well even if you do n't like juncker , got ta admit these are fairly strong statements : ** europe is the baker in kos who gives away his bread to hungry and weary souls . 
  europe is the students in munich and in passau who bring clothes for the new arrivals at the train station . 
  europe is the policeman in austria who welcomes exhausted refugees upon crossing the border . 
  this is the europe i want to live in . 
  ** ** ... the security of our eastern member states , notably the baltics . 
  the security and the borders of eu member states are untouchable . 
  i want this to be understood very clearly in moscow . 
  ** i think i will be downvoted for this , but he 's right . 
  thanks it 's actually a rather good speech . 
  dunno ... witches have a hard time in rural poland i guess with all the catholicism going on , 
  with wooden sticks my friend ... with wooden sticks , 
  well that comment made me laugh , 
  maybe the reason for the problem is , that belgium in itself is a deeply divided country with it 's own problems . 
  integrating `` outsiders '' when you do n't really get along with your fellow countrymen is a really diffcult task . 
  i think we should stick to english here , discuss this per pm or go to / r/de for this discussion in german  but i can only give you my opinion on this which mighty be different to the opinion of the `` german people '' . 
  or british . . or irish . . or australian your choice  :d, 
  damn i can only upvote once ... that 's exactly what i 'd like to see implemented until the end of 2015 . 
  csu does and they are part of the cdu . 
  but yeah calling cdu right wing is funny sinve they define themselves as '' the middle '' , 
  i 'm biased here ( yeah being a german citizen ) but hungary definitely does n't deserve the bad guy image for following eu rules . 
  i like that , my wifes family is living in ireland and i 'm happy the overall situation is improving , 
  no education is for example not a federal thing , but a regional state thing . 
  so legislation regarding education ist state wise , not federal wise . 
  there are more exceptions , but education is the only one that i definitaly can remember . 
  indeed it does in most cases . 
  nice ireland , way to go !, 
  erm why should germany say anything about this ? 
  never meddle in the affairs of dragons ... 'cause you are crunchy and delicious with ketchup , 
  word is , they were already decomposing and the truck was leaking fluids ... 
  i think ( i do n't have any experience in this field ) that the corpses were already mixing up with each other making counting a little bit difficult at first . 
   false . 
  ** some ** people ** in saxony ** are getting fed up with this shit i corrected that for you . 
  i do n't see protests in west/north or south germany . 
  in fact i only see this sh * t in saxony so do n't generalize that `` the people '' are fed up . 
  they are n't because most of us realize that we can handle this crisis rather well . 
  hm yes , but the west germans are n't protesting at large, 
  so you 're basing your statement on hearsay and not your own experience ? 
  i live near 2 shelters/homes and there are no problems with the people living in them . 
  it 's a small town here and i should 've heard/read/seen something by now . 
  so what is happening around your local refugee shelter/home ? 
  do you even have a local refugee shelter or are you just blabbering around ? 
  oh i do and though i know that the byzantine empire was more or less in responsibility for the first crusade . 
  the empire had problems with agressive nomadic tribes on their southern borders and could n't solve this problem on its own . 
  they convinced pope pius that these islamic `` barbarians '' were slaughtering christians in palestine and robbing/murdering pilgrims on their way to jerusalem and betlehem . 
  it was a great ruse to get help with an internal byzantine probleme and they even convinced the european leaders to not go by sea ( which would have been faster ) but to go by land , striking from the byzantine border ( where the problems were ) into palestine . 
  the truth is that palestine was at peace and all pilgrims ( christian and muslimic alike ) were protected from harm by the local authorities . 
  they even had an inner local war to reign in the tribes to keep the peace . 
  everything else is history , the europeans fell for the ruse and conquered the islamic palestine ( the irony here is that constantinopel got ransacked by the first crusade because the empire could n't / did n't want to provide shelter and food ) , ending the peaceful colaboration between the two religions and starting these whole middle eastern mess . 
  the arabic world saved much of the old science ( mathematics , astronomy , philosophy , medical science ) when the roman empire collapsed . 
  the rediscovery would have taken much much longer in medieval times when this would n't have happened . 
  islam at this point in time was a religion of peace , culture and understandung until we christians came along and started the first ( and any further ) crusade ( s ) . 
  it 's true , they did n't invent much ( but they expanded the knowledge ! ), 
  but they saved all the basics when `` we '' europeans fell into darkness and destroyed much of our culture and knowledge in the dark ages . 
  yeah it 's somewhere in our genes . . digging foxholes whereever there is enough sand , 
  as a german ... no the dubbed versions of most movies , tv-series and games are really crap and i wish they would stop with this and just sub the stuff . 
  i 'm really glad i can switch most of this stuff to ov, 
  granted that 's not fair ,
