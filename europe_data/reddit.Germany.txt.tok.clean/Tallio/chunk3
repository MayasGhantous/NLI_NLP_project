  indeed , the massive refugee movements because of wwii were not long in the past . 
  eesti can not into nordics , you know that , 
  orbans `` reforms '' to the hungarian constitution happened ... 
  that 's just beautiful . 
  i wish we had a proper winter in germany with temperatures below freezing and some snow ... 
  little green men at work, 
  wow that is seriously fucked up, 
  thanks  mind if i ask a further question because that 's something i ca n't wrap my head around regarding british anti-immigration statements . 
  on the one side , ukip retorics aimed at the ee ( or eu ) immigration as the main problem for the uk , at least that 's what i could read here in germany . 
  but reading some statements here and talking to british friends , most of them see muslims and the islam as the main problem in the cities of the uk and do n't want any further immigration from these parts of the world . 
  how do these two things fit together ? 
  is it unpopular ( or even to extreme for the british voter ? ), 
  to suggest that immigration from the ex-commonwealth countries has to stop and so the critics aim at the eu as the main source of problems for the british society ? 
  ah okay , never heard that one before . 
  explains alot, 
  eli5 ( honest  ) : why are the eu immigrants more problematic than the immigrants from british ex-colonies ? 
  good info , thanks !, 
  well it 's an historical flag and not forbidden to display and it 's for some of them the nearest thing they can display in terms of the `` reich '' ... but the black , red , white flag is fewer and fewer seen today , they mostly use the alternative german flag now to emphasize , that the brd ist not their country , but germany is . 
  you 're welcome , 
  no , because the swastika flag is forbidden and these guys may be stupid but not stupid enough to parade around with the actual 3rd reich flag . . 
  they use the warflag of the [ kaiserreich ( black , red , white ) ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:war_ensign_of_germany_1903-1918.svg#/media/file:war_ensign_of_germany_1903-1918.svg ) or an upside down brd flag or an alternative german flag ( looks something like the brd can into [ nordics ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:flag_de_ewirmer.svg#/media/file:flag_de_ewirmer.svg )  which was proposed 1949 as the brd flag but got turned down by adenauer who was in favor to the actual brd flag ) as their flags . 
  but for most of us normal folk , these flags are called `` nazi flags '' \u00b4 . 
  wow you are right , never heard of that one ... but it 's more a regional traditional meal and not something that is served in the majority of germany . 
  it 's interesting to note that the traditional `` potatoe salad on christmas eve '' meal comes from the years directly after wwii . 
  most families in the time from 1945 till the mid fifties could n't afford more traditional christmas meals like carp or goose and served potatoe salad with some kind of sausage ( mostly wiener , they were the cheapest sausages avaiable ) . 
  this meal stuck with young generation of after-war children and even 70 years after wwii , many germans still serve `` potatoe salad and sausages '' on christmas eve . 
  i looked at the german ones and it looks like they mixed up 2 different `` traditional '' christmas eve meals ( roasted goose with sides , potatoe salad with sausages ) into one big banquette . 
  i mean ... who eats roasted goose , weisswurst , potatoe salad , rotkraut and brussel sprouts all in one meal ? 
  that 's kinda culinary excessive :d, 
  i 'd like to see a movie about solidarno\u015b\u0107 i have to admit . 
  wwii movies are the same old all along now . 
  actually it was a palestinian girl, 
  i do n't think he discussed this letter with anyone in the eu before sending it . 
  we 'll see what happens , i 'm a little bit worried though ... 
   i tended to get questions about tipping or nervous glances from europeans to see who i was giving money to . 
  i heard a bunch of complaints about how us tipping was confusing and people felt worried about being embarrassed for doing something wrong . 
  uhm i found tipping in london rather confusing i have to admit . 
  tipping in germany is rather straightforward in a restaurant : you get your meal served to the table , you generally tip the waiter/waitress for the service . 
  in london , we went to three restaurants and in all three the tipping thing was handled differenty which left us confused . 
  first one we got our meal served at the table , we tipped the waitress when we paid , everything fine . 
  the second one was more like a small chinese fast food restaurant with 5 tables , but we still got our meals/refreshments served to the table so we tipped when we paid and the guy was very confused why we wanted to pay more for the food ... after the explanation he laughed and was relieved because he thought we wanted to make a joke or something . 
  third restaurant there was a service charge which we understood as `` tipping is included in the prices '' . 
  waitress seemed to be a tittle offended that we did n't tip her , which was confusing as hell to us . 
  so i think there are just different tipping `` cultures '' in every country and not a `` europeans do it this way , americans do it that way '', 
  see ... my grandparents helped delaying operation seel\u00f6we ... :d, 
  yes correct , when my grandparents were gifted with it after marriage , my granddad used it as toiletpaper according to family stories ... 
  there 's some joke hidden in that headline , i 'm sure :d crazy times ... 
  well it depends on the perspective if a fence is built to keep people in or out ... 
  well not true my local newspaper here had a big article about this `` debacle '' today, 
   i 'd say then it 's your duty to figure out the option that 'd be best for your country and fight for that . 
  well maybe they figured out that leaving the country and coming back after the war to rebuild was the best option for them ? 
  just food for thought ... 
   i expect more instabilities while slowly germany and france will force you to become like bosnia . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i do n't understand the reference, 
  welcome to europe , 
  small town here , with some houses dedicated to asylum seekers . 
  no problems so far and i did n't hear anything when i 'm going to fetch a beer or two in our `` pub '' . 
  everything 's pretty normal . 
  i 'm more concerned about the german turks and kurds fighting each other than about the refugees . 
  yes that will be the pivotal point when every shit hits the fan . 
  i do n't think the afd will get a majority in the federal vote in 2017 . 
  they will be present in the reichstag , but only in the oposition with something around 10-15 % . 
  we will get another 5 years of a grand coalition with merkel at its helm . 
  after that . . all bets are off , i doubt she will do another 5 year term . 
  you 're welcome , 
  in june . 
  here you [ go ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/trump-would-not-leap-to-defend-baltic-states-from-russian-attack-nyt.html ), 
  i think trump stated that he does n't care about the baltics / europe and the american obligation ( through nato ) to defend them . 
  we will have a war with russia anyway only question is when . 
  if donald really pulls out american troops from all over the world and de facto dissolves nato in it 's current form , do you really think putin wo n't make his moves soon after ? 
  the `` no fly zone '' idea was crappy and not feasible but his statements are by far more dangerous for peace . 
  i 'm sad i ca n't upvote this more . 
  brilliant post !, 
  no sorry we can not afford another refugee crisis at the moment . 
  but you might try australia . 
  enlighten me . . how can trump not do all the things when senate and congress is republican too . 
  will they really f *** him up when he tries to do . . nationalconservative politics ? 
  do n't be glad , this will affect us all badly . 
  indeed they are and i 'm happy to have paid for that :d, 
  this here is the gold advice , 
  yeah i 'm asking that myself ... 
  no i do n't think there is a holiday for that . 
  well . . that 's how it looks with everything in the picture : [ heizk\u00f6rper ] ( http://mcms.tmmedien.com/data/clipboard/0fc4c4e5df108afe14233310f63363ea.jpg ) . 
  so the little thing is only a meter to regulate the hot water flow through the radiator . 
  operation seel\u00f6we ... now for real / s, 
  w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk as always on weekdays . 
  and i had to laugh at the `` early birds '' because it was already 9:00 in the morning when you wrote this ( and i already w\u00f6rked for 2,5 hours  ), 
  the only political party with the will to profoundly change the whole system in favor of the `` normal '' people is the left . 
  everyone else is proposing the status quo or wanting to make things worse . 
  which is kinda sad because we need reforms in every social system badly . 
  whom do you suggest ? 
  you might want to look up the `` reichsb\u00fcrgergesetz '' and to some degree the `` blutschutzgesetz '' . 
  both point in the same direction of erm '' ~ ~ racial ~ ~ ethnic integrity '', 
  i thought the same and was a little bewildered :d, 
  i read that with a sexy french accent :d, 
  that would be nice but i doubt this will happen in my lifetime . 
  maybe i 'm lucky to see someone walk on mars : /, 
  efficency at w\u00f6rk !, 
  not really our cops are more laid back and relaxed than most people think .
