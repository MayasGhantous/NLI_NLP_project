  yes and after that probably deportation, 
  yes i know you guys are hit pretty hard by these problems for years now thanks to the inactivity of the governments in the nothern eu . 
  no , the main problem is that these countries do n't accept their citizens back and it 's illegal in international law to just `` dump '' people in other countries . 
  so . . until treaties are made with these countries they ca n't get deported even if they are positivily identified as citizens of said countries . 
  well obviously because i never heard about that either ... 
  source ? 
  110 in germany, 
  `` verliese/kerker und drachen '' is the translation . 
  do n't know where the `` r '' should come from . 
  well it 's not , because it 's called `` dungeons and dragons '' in german too . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm late to the topic but it 's not true . 
  germany had a deficit in budget for a long long time , only in recent years ( i think since 2014 ? ), 
  we had a balanced budget . 
  there is nothing in our constitution that demands a balanced budget but our finance ministers goal is to stop overspending in the future so he 's doing everything he can to keep a balanced budget . 
  ah well then i redact my statement , but . . is n't she stating the obvious then ? 
  i do n't think any illegal immigrants children anywhere in europe are getting `` free education '' since you need papers and such to get your children into the school system . 
  who does she mean then ? 
  . . and cheaper, 
  source ? 
  uhm switzerland is 6 hours away , the netherlands 30 minutes . 
  while i like swiss cheese , the netherlands are just more convenient to drive to :d, 
   now it 's vice versa , we go to germany to shop i still go to the netherlands to shop for coffee and cheese , 
  - redacted - discussion is a little bit further down , 
  yes but she probably meant `` brown people '', 
  damn machines stealing hopeful humans the jobs !, 
  tbh i would love to be the maintenance technician of this and future fusion reactors , 
   hint : it 's 2016 , civilised people are done killing each other over lines on maps . 
  get over it . 
  i wish that would be the truth . 
  sadly , it 's not :(, 
  last time you tried to sort things out , it took you 30 years . . so no we need a more efficient way for this, 
  same in german : wei\u00dfrussland, 
  yeah but not in this elections . 
  he would be stupid to compede with merkel but maybe in the next elections , if merkel steps down , he will take a step forward . 
  and that 's okay , i like him and he should wait until he has a fair chance to win elections in germany with the spd . 
  he said that he will stay in european politics . 
  and yet with this proposed system the british would complain that the eu parliament is dominated by germany in either way of counting ( proportionate or gdp ) . 
  brexit would have come too , because `` the eu parliament and systems are unfair to the uk because of german dominance '' * chuckle *, 
  maybe that failed every time because it was n't peaceful attempts ? 
   because this is how you get terrorism again ... which will be sad when it happens . 
  grand tour is starting tomorrow , woho !, 
  who else ... 
  i hope that this will last , good luck greece , 
  a quick google search told me : last payment for wwi was done in 2010 , the money owed for wwi war reparations was repayed in 1983 , but the interests for loans was n't and were paid from 1996 - 2010 . 
  for wwii the last payment of war reparations and debt is scheduled for 2034 . 
  so you might say that the federal republic of germany paid and will pay for both world wars nearly a century after they ended . 
  that 's reads more like `` torture techniques during the dark ages '' than something from 1918-1921 . 
  horryfying . 
   shame is not on me though , but on you sir . 
  i 'm not sure if this is a poor trolling attempt or if you are serious agitated and really believe in the things you are writing , so i will try an educated approach to your words/accusations . 
  i 'm not ashamed of my countries history and why should i ? 
  every generation that was born after the year 1933 was n't responsible for what happened during hitlers reign and wwii . 
  but ... remembrance and education on what happenend is key here . 
  i ca n't be held responsible for the sins of my ( grand - ) grandfathers but i am responsible , that this will never happen again . 
  and this should be the lesson for everyone , regardles in which country you live : learn about the errors of the past , when how and why they happened and prevent them from happening again . 
   what ? 
  i am dead serious . 
  well that 's a shame ... 
  not sure if / s ... 
  yeah but they are not usable by turkey in any way . 
   we have nazis in forests training german or dutch nazis ? 
  i suggest / r/steirereier , 
  this time you can have a chunk , we 'll pass, 
  a bridge too far depicts the illfated drop of the polish paratroopers near arnheim really well and while they were later rescued/evacuated , the movie does n't ommit the fact that they defended bravely against all odds in their positions . 
  ha nice try ... but how would erdolf know when alcohol is haram ? 
  but that insult would definitly ramp up tensions :d, 
  shhhh do n't give him ideas man !, 
  oh yeah i 'm not concerend by the `` nazi , nazi '' screaming as well , just curious if they get creative with the insults , 
  i 'm really curious about the insults that will be thrown at us now . 
  the nazi thing get 's old really fast ... 
  the 4th reich obviously, 
  do n't be afraid , our `` testing ground '' was always belgium / s, 
  yeah . . but we like you better than * them *, 
  uhm ... niedersachsen is between nrw and schleswig holstein , so you may have to make concessions for them as well . 
   but still ... the number of germans in nl is not negligible . 
  we are just ... * ahem * on vacation . 
  move along , citizen, 
  low-skilled jobs are already done by computer systems and intelligent software , so the whole immigration spin does n't work around here . 
  it 's just pure greed so the shareholders get more money paid ... 
  yeah ... 
  i think `` we '' are supposed to buy the stocks of the insurance companies we are employed with . 
  but most of these stocks are not on the free market , so you ca n't buy them ( if you can afford them btw ) . 
  so it 's just a royally fu the employer brought to the table . 
  true ... during the talks for pay raises for the insurance employees ( i think it 's called collective bargaining in english but i 'm not sure ) between the unions and the employers , the employers said the following : `` if the employees want a pay raise , they should buy stocks '' needless to say , we are now on strike on a regular basis ... 
  climate change is serious business when the finnish people start to melt . 
  i truly love this comic , 
  no parachutes , that 's why it 's called hard brexit, 
  this thread is a perfect example of the `` us vs them '' mentality that is lately spreading here . 
  good luck lads , hopefully you get a decent and functioning government, 
  well iirc the sentiment in the netherlands towards the germans after the liberation was more like hatred , contempt and rage so it was nice to hear some small tale about a farmer who treated him decently . 
  interestingly enough , my grandfather served as a leutnant in a flak unit in cologne . 
  when the war ended he was sent to the netherlands as pow to work on a farm . 
  he always spoke highly of the dutch because he was treated decently and friendly by the farmers family albeit the things that the germans did to the dutch during the occupation . 
  wait ... complaining is a core german virtue . 
  so when the french believe in complaining and us germans do . . we just need to find common complaining grounds and could rule the world together . 
  look what the eu has achieved !, 
  it 's really sad to see a man , whose only positive view of his own country comes from the past and who needs to constantly remind everybody else , how great his country ** was ** a long time ago . 
  if everybody who does this would focus on ** now ** instead of then , the world would be a better place . 
  i 'm not surprised ...
