  but in large parts , somebody 's answer to the question whether crimea should belong to the ukraine or russia depends on their view to the old question whether the principle of [ self-determination ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination ) ( most inhabitants of crimea are ethincally russian ) or the souvereignty of a country 's borders ( as guaranteed for example by the budapest memorandum , which you mentioned ) is more important . 
  so by saying that the invasion of iraq was ` even less justified ' than the annexation of crimea , i 'm not saying that i regard the annexation of crimea as justified , i 'm simply acknowledging that this can have * some * justification , depending on the perspective of the person you 're asking . 
  a catalan may base the independance of catalonia on the principle of self-determination , while a castilian may be more convinced by the souvereignty of the spanish borders ( surprise , surprise ) . 
  there are countless other examples . 
  would you have boycotted a world cup in the us after the invasion of iraq ( which was way more destructive and even less justified ) ? 
  good . 
   did n't pegida start out of one of the regions with the lowest amount of muslims in germany ? 
  yes , 16,000 in a bundesland ( ` state ' ) with 4 million inhabitants . 
  i never quite got today 's admiration for bismarck in germany . 
  like any person ever he had his good sides ( did n't want african colonies , wanted a ` saturated ' germany instead of an ever-expanding one , german social state ) and his bad sides ( wars , treatment of poles ) . 
  but some people always seem to need somebody to either fully glorify or fully despise . 
  this thread is exhibit a. 
  people do n't need to make him the second coming of either jesus or hitler . 
  obama that fucking ~ ~ socialist ~ ~ monarchist !!!, 
  ok , i know i 'm late but hollande looks like john oliver who went on to become a fat russian oligarch . 
  to my knowledge , it is in essence a legal distinction . 
  ` officially ' for a constitution you need a national assembly , meaning that all citizens are represented . 
  since the gg was decided by and applied to west germany only , the east germans were not represented . 
  holy shit . 
  context : the lyrics were really , really stupid . 
  stuff like : `` erdogan beats girls while wearing a rubber mask . '', 
  zdf , the broadcaster , did n't like this and pulled the episode from their online library . 
  maybe b\u00f6hmermann was testing out what stupid stuff erdogan was willing to react to . 
  still pretty weak from zdf , although i can understand that they prefer a more substantial satire over pure insults . 
  ps : erdogan has a small wiener and dances around in women 's clothes . 
  that ship must take up rougly half of slovenia 's coastline . 
  we do n't really have any ` super-elite ' universities like oxford and cambridge in germany . 
  universities which excel in research receive extra funding . 
  this is called ` excellence initiative ' , and the universities which receive this are sometimes called ` elite universities ' . 
  these 11 unis are currently ( in no particular order ) : 1 . 
  eberhard-karls-universit\u00e4t t\u00fcbingen 2 . 
  ruprecht-karls-universit\u00e4t heidelberg 3 . 
  there was [ not a single outbreak in the netherlands in the last year . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/docs/hpai-outbreaks_15_2015-16.png ) [ in fact no single human was ever reported infected with avian flu in europe . 
  ] ( http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/avian_influenza/pages/index.aspx ) according to the european centre for disease prevention and control :  no human infection with these viruses have been reported in eu/eea countries . 
  the risk of transmission to the general public is extremely low . 
  persons at risk are mainly those in direct contact/handling diseased birds or poultry , or their carcasses ( e.g. 
  farmers , veterinarians and labourers involved in the culling and rendering ) . 
  [ also , you probably ca n't be infected by eating cooked bird meat . 
  ] ( http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/zoonose/avian/en/ ) according to the who :  to date , no epidemiological data suggest that the disease can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked food ( even if contaminated with the virus prior to cooking ) [ also , you can not be infected with the avian flu by eating eggs . 
  ] ( http://www.who.int/foodsafety/areas_work/zoonose/avian/en/index1.html ) again , according to the who :  there is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that people have been infected with avian influenza through the consumption of eggs or egg products . 
  i 'm amazed , from your other comments it seems like you are actually not joking . 
  animals are far more likely to contract diseases if they are packed . 
  also the avian flu is not a issue in these parts * at all * . 
  outside it 's 4m \u00b2 per chicken , where at least half of the area is green . 
  inside it 's 1/6th of a square meter . 
  no , but it 's also not a sign of being overwhelmed . 
  it 's a sign of a horrendous accounting practice . 
  that 's not what 's in the article . 
  what happened is that the refugees were counted upon entering the country ( without writing down their names ) . 
  later , the refugees were registered at refugee camps and counted there . 
  this means that people who then went to denmark and sweden appear in the first number , but not in the second number . 
  the discrepancy between the first number and the second number is 130,000 . 
  i agree , riga is one of the most beautiful cities i 've been to - at least in the city center . 
  the suburbs on the other hand ... let 's just say that they look stereotypically post-soviet . 
  but everybody should visit riga . 
  that 's true , locally the deviations might be strong . 
  great effort by somebody with a user name that translates to ` gassing of jews ' . 
  this link might work : http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/197/umfrage/straftaten-in-deutschland-seit-1997/ germany has about 81m inhabitants who committed 6m criminal offences in 2014 ( 1 criminal offence per 13,5 inhabitants ) . 
  for crime to go up 10 % in 2015 , 600,000 additional crimes would have to be committed ( which is still less than 2004 , when refugee numbers were [ close to the all-time low after the balkan war ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/asyl-grafik-101~_v-videowebl.jpg ) ) . 
  lets go with the most extreme number that 's tossed around in the media and assume 1.5 m refugees come to germany in 2015 . 
  that means that 1 in 2.5 refugees would need to commit a crime to result an a spike of 10 % ( assuming the crime rates of everybody else stays the same ) . 
  you said it yourself , most refugees came since september , so those refugees would have much less time to commit all those crimes . 
  if we 're ` generous ' and assume they essentially came since the summer instead of autumn , that doubles the crime rate to 1.25 crimes per refugee . 
  all in all , for crime to go up even 10 % , there would have to be a crime for almost every new refugee in germany in 2015 . 
  but 10 % is not even a noticeable spike in crime . 
  you do n't notice when instead of 10 burglaries , 11 are committed in your neighbourhood . 
  you do n't notice when instead of 10 muggings , 11 are committed in your neighbourhood . 
  these things you only notice when you read the statistics , not from your ` gut feeling ' . 
  i do n't think you noticed 11 stabbings instead of 10 in a given time frame . 
  so you must be talking about a * significant * rise in crime due to the refugee situation , something like 30 % ? 
  this would result in almost 2.5 crimes per new refugee in germany in 2015 !, 
  which is of course ridiculous . 
  maybe your gut feeling about the substantial rise in crime is more due to your own expectation and prejudices of what happens when the refugees come . 
  or it comes down to a difference in reporting . 
  but a rise in crime that is noticeable from a ` gut feeling ' can not mathematically be down to the refugees coming . 
  what spikes in crime are you talking about ? 
  http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/212/umfrage/polizeilich-erfasste-straftaten/ there are of course no conclusive numbers for 2015 yet , but it seems to be that ( official ) crime rates have been quite stable recently . 
  i think crime is something nobody ever says is going down , unless there are crazy differences . 
  source on the funding part ? 
  dude , are we related ? 
  i have no idea what you mean by this . 
  how does the fact that the annual tax revenue is 45 % of the german gdp lead to a ` return of investment ' of 45 % ( i.e. 
  7b out of 15b ) on refugee expenses ? 
  you are talking about investments from the government in refugee housing ( in which case what you said may be true , especially when it comes to property speculation ) , but i 'm talking about the money refugees receive themselves ( pocket money and so on ) , which they spend on food , leisure time etc. , which is pretty much the opposite of trickle-down economics . 
  i do n't have any numbers , but i imagine that an additional million people spending money ( even if it that money is supplied by the state ) must be a hell of an economic stimulus program . 
  this could indeed be one reason for the huge surplus . 
  people like to act like the money the refugees receive goes down the drain , when the vast majority is actually spent in germany . 
  no , this map shows how powerful earthquakes can be ( or have been in the past ) . 
  please finish the following sentence : `` if they did , they would ... '', 
  you 'd need some strong-ass trucks . 
  maybe he means centre-backs . 
  defensive midfielders on the other hand are welcome to every neighbourhood !, 
   `` letting the workers of the world unite '' this is quite the imaginative spin on the story in order to make her look left-wing . 
  this is a spin tactic commonly used by the afd and the right-wing media that supports them ( like compact , junge freiheit or pi ) . 
  their image of an enemy are leftists . 
  who is a leftist ? 
  anybody who disagrees with them . 
  a good example was when frauke petry ( head of the afd ) called the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung ( big conservative newspaper ) ` left-fascist ' after a critical article . 
  lol,
