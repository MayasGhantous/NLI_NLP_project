  at least none of you knows our secret name , by which we can be summoned . 
  i like the video . 
  i did n't know about the 4th largest machine industry , or the 3rd largest machine-export capability . 
  personaly i too believe history should be taught about the people ( i watched your video `` what 's wrong ... '' ) and i think the financial facts to be an important part of it , that mostly is ignored in teaching history . 
  in school we only learned about the german part of the treaty of versailles . 
  nothing about austria . 
  not only did they loose territory and people , but the financial hardship must have been immense as well , because of it . 
  [ palmesel ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/palmesel ) ( palm-donkey ) : the palmesel belongs to the custom of the palmprocession of the roman-catholic church at the palmsonntag in the southern german-speaking area .

  i made a mistake . 
  well . 
  nobody knows nothing yet and quite frankly who really admits a mistake ( if it is one in the first place , for whatever reason maybe it really works for the british . ), 
  in hindsight ? 
  the next 2 years will be negotiated and 2 years living with the outcome . 
  that would make sense to me . 
  just saying . 
  in 4 years the question would be interesting , but definitly not now .

  this is great !, 
  it 's probably a german thing to love big engineering . 
  i am quite envious of norway ( this ) and swiss ( gotthard-basistunnel ) ingenuity in that regard , because germany simply sucks nowadays compared to them . 
  either it 's a total fuckup like the airport in berlin or a quadrillon times more costly like hamburgs elbphilharmonie . 
  translation : reuter reports : president wilson signed the war application and a proclamation on the war with germany . 
  both houses of the american congress have declared that their country is at war with germany , and the president has given his signature . 
  the united states has entered the war against us . 
  herr wilson had tried to call it a war against the german government , not against the german people . 
  as germans we unanimously reject this as a grossly untrue distortion of the facts . 
  with how much greater rights , however , we can turn this distinction around and apply it to the war declaration of the united states . 
  this is the war of president wilson !, 
  as prove you must only read the log reports from both houses of the congress . 
  few voices were the only ones who had ventured openly against the all-powerful president . 
  today , after the victory of democracy in russia , it is not the germans but the americans who possess the strongest , the most autocratic leader of the world . 
  there were some in both houses of the congress who had the courage to openly challenge mr. wilson 's war . 
  for example mr. kitchin himself , the house majority leader of the government . 
  it was in the senate following a new incoming report mr. stone , the chairman for foreign affairs . 
  it was also senator lafolette , the head of the progressive republicans , the most fundamentally democratic democrat america possessed on the far side of social democracy . 
  this , too , is characteristic of the profound untruth of the formulation that the united states ought to take part in a war of democracy against german absolutism . 
  the best and most prestigious democrats like lafolette and kitchin refuse to believe this . 
  and the satirical play of the whole performance is found in the pathos with which herr gardener unfurls the flag of democracy against us germans , herr gardener , who has been sent from the strictly conservative new england to the house of representatives , whose innermost soul is as repugnant to all democracy as perhaps herr st\u00fcrmer or herr protopopow . 
  are the american people in favour of war ? 
  not only the news from our own new york representative , but also english reporters , have in recent days repeatedly noticed that the patriotic enthusiasm for this type of warfare has so far been confined to quite thin sections of the population , that the public mood seems to be mostly dark and unpleasant . 
  in the west and the midwest , this is presumably still more widespread than in new york and washington , where the reporters alone can judge by their own observations . 
  but the american politicians would have to be worse directors than they have been known to them so far , if they did not succeed in whipping the masses against the self-chosen enemy . 
  whatever may come , we do not want to fall into the fault of pretending ourselves to be invincible . 
  this war , in which the united states entered yesterday , is the emergence of the war of president wilson . 
  but for us today it is practically the war of america against germany . 
  it is a war which we must take seriously , but who will not frighten us either , nor will any of us substantially dampen the inner development of these first spring and easter days . 
  in the third year the german people have now held themselves admirably against the onslaught of the world , the `` old world . '', 
  we will not be defeated by the new world of mr. wilson !, 
  in the german state of [ hesse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hesse ) are regions that are considered so dismal and dull , that germans refer to them as hessisch-uganda and hessisch-siberia . 
  kitty . 
  it is always fascinating how much music enhances emotion . 
  the downside being that extremist propaganda exploits this as well . 
  from your point of view . 
  what would it take to start reconciliation ? 
  i wonder when all parties of the war will start to reconciliate ? 
  if i take germany into account , i would say it took round about 30 years ( mid 70ies ) when the world did not constantly frown at us anymore . 
  in the past i would have thought your point to be right . 
  usually for the jobs that went away new jobs in maintainence were created . 
  this might not be the case anymore , because the new kind of automation does that as well . 
  i concur more with the view of for example cgp grey : [ humans need not apply ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pq-s557xqu ) , instead of mr. krugmans essay from 1997 . 
  the subject of automization really tears me apart . 
  on the one hand it is good that workers in asia wont be exploited with inhuman working conditions . 
  on the other hand , a worker looses the chance to make a livelihood . 
  will i boycott their products or wont i ?

  [ the dolchsto\u00dflegende ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stab-in-the-back_myth ), 
  i doubt that , but i would like the english language to be improved . 
  like the general noun uppercase . 
  through identifying the verb + noun uppercase one is able to read very fast , because those two are the most important pieces of a sentence . 
  ooh , but i think the beer and the bratwurst , along with the mustard and ketchup , were provided by the belgian bros.

  til [ ode to freedom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ode_to_joy ) :  academic speculation remains as to whether schiller originally wrote an ode to freedom ( ode an die freiheit ) and changed it to an ode to joy . '' . 
  the thought lies near that it was the early form of the poem , when it was still an ` ode to freedom ' ( not ` to joy ' ) , which first aroused enthusiastic admiration for it in beethoven 's mind '' . 
   just i do n't feel comfortable talking to people in my pajamas .
