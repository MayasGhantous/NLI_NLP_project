  it was one of the best papers this country ever had . 
  balanced and well researched . 
  it \u00b4 s not everyday that i do get to read a phrase like `` can you hear a big laugh all the way across the rhine ? 
  '' , but when i do i enjoy it . 
  i am with you . 
  in germany all to many like to `` argue '' ad hominem . 
  one will never win over racists by calling them stupid . 
  sound advice , 
  you made us built and ( partly ) pay that tunnel for those tanks to be faster at the frontline . 
  tricksy dane ( itses ) . 
  well if you annex flensburg you gain the kraftfahrzeugbundesamt . 
  they will probably be responsible for that road-toll . 
  is it a conspiracy by denmark ? 
  do u want germony to gib that clay back ? 
  the feeling when you come to a reddit-thread simply to congratulate someone , and half the party is clashing fueled by trolls =(, 
  belgians make beer great again . 
  but when you do travel the distance canada ist truly beautiful . 
  i have visited banf and jasper . 
  to this day it has a lasting impact . 
  are gun and kill by any chance sister cities ? 
  well , technically it is a top 20 list . 
  but as the word beautiful is involved i simply do not understand how berlin beats prague or laibach . 
  right now putin = russia . 
  when one day russia = russia again then we might have a thread ( t ) of how to cope with that . 
  who knows ? 
  russia = russia could be awesome , so that everybody likes them . 
  i for one wish them excactly that . 
   be lazy wot ? 
  bu ... but mein beloved w\u00f6rk !, 
  zis is unheard of , zis must be a trap !, 
   `` the fact was that for the first three days , we received no information about what happened , '' stephan herrlich , the brother of one of those who died in the attack , told german public broadcaster ard . 
  `` we know now that my brother was lying in the morgue as of around 11:30 p.m. on the night of the attack and that he had his id card with him and could have been identified . '', 
    by contrast , ** berlin 's charit\u00e9 hospital sent bills to family members for postmortem examinations . 
  some arrived before christmas ** and threatened recipients with debt collectors if they did n't pay up . 
  holy shit . 
  this makes me so mad . 
  r/accidental _ das_boot, 
  the moon europe . 
  awesome !, 
  in germany we have sometimes news about how a fire-fighter started a fire , for wanting attention or having a helper-syndrome or whatever . 
  and a tunnel to mallorca . 
  wait , where is mallorca ? 
  great . 
  i did n't know i needed that , but i do . 
  thank you very much . 
  until i see pictures of the alleged design i say fake news . 
  beat by 7 minutes  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/once_upon_a_time..._man, 
  i 'm oddly proud . 
  you are right and yet for me it 's just the other side of the same coin . 
  it is considered politically correct by some in germany to use methods against right-wing-suspected without any proof of the matter , even unlawful actions . 
  politically correctness has a broader meaning in germany than just the use of the `` correct '' vocabulary . 
   german tolerance strikes again . 
  german ~ ~ tolerance ~ ~ political correctness strikes again . 
  sad but true . 
   that 's now how water works ... 
  thank you so much for that comment , 
  i lean towards the left picture . 
  scotland is awesome that 's what . 
  these are spectacular pictures . 
  i read hungarian polar bears at first , 
   in the end no action i doubt that there will be action , but i truly do n't know . 
  if you read about the [ rotherham scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal ) you realise that the authorities had data ( child grooming by mostly pakistani groups ) and did n't act . 
  they have made certain changes in england because of that . 
  if they can , maybe we can too ? 
  if i may suggest a very good documentary that covers the problems . 
  trevor phillips is a former chairman of the equality and human rights commission ( ehrc ) very long so i paused-post it , but you can watch all of it of course https://youtu.be/tb2ifikowyu?t=2370, 
   germany has the `` power '' the problem are laws that were ** meant good ** , but are a hindrance . 
  the statistics are well but because of data protection ca n't be taken to act upon named data . 
  for example :  these figures are based on the number of respondents in the respective country , about 98 % in somalia and 87 % in egypt . 
  and charlotte weil wants help by the ministry of families  the federal ministry of families should support us . 
  and we urgently need counseling , because the girls do not know where to go , and they can not be passed on anywhere . 
  to act upon the statistic would be ** racial profiling ** . 
  you might say it 's for the good and i agree but it wont happen , because a lot of certain political parties will fight it like hell , because if you do it once you have set a precedent . 
  how so ? 
  well , the police knows ( and the statistic proves it ) certain crimes are ( overwhelmingly ) comitted by certain groups . 
  for example : pickpocketing = romania , grandparent scam ( fraud against elderly ) = poland and bulgaria , street sale of drugs = somalia and so on . 
  so they know all that but ca n't act because all that would be racial profiling . 
  i link here the article in the s\u00fcddeutsche of the interview with charlotte weil . 
  some google translations  `` mothers have their daughters circumcised because they want the best for them ''   it is an extrapolation . 
  the federal statistical office knows how many girls under 18 live from countries where genital mutilation is practiced . 
  these figures are based on the number of respondents in the respective country , about 98 % in somalia and 87 % in egypt . 
  and we take the time factor into account : in the second generation of migrants only half as many girls are affected because of the cultural adjustment . 
    in most instances , teachers , social workers , who have a concrete point of reference , are calling . 
  sometimes mothers , too , whose husband wants circumcision . 
  we then try to get in contact with counseling centers . 
  if the suspicions harden , it goes to the youth office . 
  this could , for example , agree with the parents , that there is no genital mutilation . 
    it would be more useful if we were to train the trainers as multipliers , who then went to schools . 
  the federal ministry of families should support us . 
  and we urgently need counseling , because the girls do not know where to go , and they can not be passed on anywhere . 
  and there is still a shortage to make : female genital mutilation is neither a topic in medicine studies nor in the development of midwives . 
  there are many doctors who have never heard of it . 
  how do you want to recognize the threat or act competently if you have no idea ? 
   german officials vowed to take a harsher stance this year . 
  in february , government officials announced a crackdown on genital mutilations , primarily targeting families consenting to such practices . 
  `` vowed '' is weasle talk by government officials, 
  i think that 's very clever . 
  so 3 reopened cases already , i would like to read a follow-up some day . 
  the only nazi that liked entartete kunst ( and probably stole a shitton of it ) was g\u00f6ring . 
   locations where traditional power structures let 's do that again .
