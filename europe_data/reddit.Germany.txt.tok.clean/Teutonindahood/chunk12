  this can only be achieved by dedicated people who are willing to invest their time . 
   the project is the brainchild of young social entrepreneur mursal hedayat ( photo at top ) . 
  she had the idea after visiting the notorious calais refugee camp , but is more personally familiar with the challenges teachers face . 
  as a child she arrived in the uk from afghanistan with her mother , who 'd had a high-flying career in international development , governance and academia in kabul . 
  although hedayat was too young to remember arriving in the uk , she does recall how difficult it was for her mother to use her skills , experience and potential when she claimed asylum . 
   `` losing everything does n't just mean losing your possessions , '' she said . 
  `` it does n't have to be this way , but unfortunately it means leaving behind everything you 've built intellectually , socially as well as spiritually . 
  you lose your networks . 
  you lose your professional status . 
  your degree does n't work anymore . '', 
   looking the other way i must say the spiegel seems to be angry with malta this week . 
   appalling chutzpah , 
  good thing that i am a member of the uberculture . 
  so no ~ ~ unter ~ ~ different culture can threaten us . 
  beer and engineering . 
  very german . 
   this article lacks only bratwurst . 
   thank god that we are in central europe good beer deserves defence . 
  i always suspected that bulgaria is destined for greatness . 
  this might be it .

  til : allready a thing electromotors as an armored chain drive or wheel drive were already considered from the beginning ( holtgas-electric tank ) , but rarely , and then unsatisfactory , brought to the production standard ( eg [ jagdpanzer elephant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elefant ) ) . 
  the use of electric motors would offer various advantages , for example gearing and drive shafts would be superfluous . 
  the electric motors are powered by generators which are driven by internal combustion engines . 
  today , this type of drive is mainly used for locomotives and ships and is usually designed as a diesel electric drive . 
  the role they will play in future armored structures , including the development of hybrid electric vehicles , can not yet be assessed . 
  [ german panzer wiki ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/panzer#elektromotoren ), 
  this article has an interesting map of european and international assembly plants in mexico . 
  off topic : i have not seen much from our mexican friends in this sub for a while . 
  how are you ? 
  one can wish but not demand . 
  what truly shocks me is dublin and zurich . 
  now it makes sense !, 
    but still today we cultivate rice as we once did , nothing has changed , the process has remained the same . 
  i was like ?? 
  ( sighs ) once again i fail at humour :(, 
  we had to study so hard , there was no time for boredom .

  i think it is great when people/politics take action instead of lamenting . 
  so best of luck to switzerland . 
  i envy you . 
  i find this very touching/moving . 
  fair points . 
  very well voiced . 
   political scientist ulrike guerot , a professor for european politics and a democracy researcher at danube university krems in austria , also posed that question while speaking with dw . 
  she thinks that `` pulse '' is generally something positive , but says its ten-point thesis is too vague . 
  she believes the problem with the movement is that it seeks to defend europe on the basis of values such as freedom and democracy . 
  but proclaiming a commitment to the eu as it is right now seems like `` the protection of vested rights , '' and that simply is n't enough . 
  guerot says : `` if things were functioning properly , people would not have to take to the streets . '', 
  angela should try to convince donald to put that amount into nato . 
  great propaganda , the best . 
  next should be only models 18 + years old .

  [ b\u00fcck dich hoch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q44p_qbq9o ) . 
  totally german . 
  i am you in german . 
  have you ever heard of [ independent study ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_study ) ? 
  nobody hinders the likes of us ( aside from procrastination and time manegement maybe ) . 
  i am a fan of lifelong learning anyhow . 
   ineffective very perceptive . 
  it is a growing problem . 
  instead of learning how to think in a scientific way most become logically and rethorically inapt . 
  the situation is described as bulimic-learning in germany . 
  you learn for the papers `` you puke it out '' , but you do n't understand . 
  businesses are allready complaining about the quality of university education , which is kind of ironic , because many changes were made on their behest . 
  awesome . 
  thank you for the pdf !, 
  you are like dwarfs . 
  underground and rich , 
  no logic . 
  i delete it , because in hindsight disrespectful . 
  it 's like a popular myth and it might have happened in the past . 
  just think about it . 
  german men are no different than anybody else . 
  we are controlled by our girlfriends/wifes . 
  do you really believe our women would let go of the leash for us to wear socks and sandals ? 
  this must be one of the times an austrian would wish to read an australian . 
  does a muezzin really climb that 5 times a day ? 
   pushed towards further education the same applies to germany . 
  the `` problem '' is that almost everybody has a secondary education . 
  because of that `` too many '' start a tertiary education but fail because our universities root them out like weed , instead of forstering or encouraging them . 
  when you start you will quite literarily hear in your first lecture/course :  guten tag . 
  welcome to xxx . 
  please have a look to your right . 
  and now have a look to your left . 
  the persons to your right and to your left will be gone in half a year . 
  i think this is actually interesting as fuck . 
  thank you for posting . 
  german speaking countries are high on homeopathy ( hahnemann geh du voran ) , just shows that even reasonable mentalities can be quite nonsensical . 
  the baltics are much into herbal treatment , can some of you please explain in more detail what exactly you are using ? 
  like do you drink lots of herbals or do you make wound dressings out of them ? 
  the nordics seem to do chiropractics . 
  ( o_o ) just reading about that makes my back hurt . 
  what 's the history behind that ? 
  the onus of responsibility for the eu steels our lifetime . 
  no , we do n't . 
  to my knowledge the gulf stream is not as important .
