  this is the exact definition of a clickbait headline . 
  is there any illigeal human trafficing between france and the uk ( as in criminals are ferrying small boats between dunkirk and the island , for example ) ? 
  i very much doubt the peaceful part of this equation . 
  the children of nazi-bigwigs are to be pitied . 
  most are under such emotional stress we ca n't comprehend . 
  many of them stated publicy that they will never have children . 
  which is understandable but from my point of view is utter nonsense because it gives credit to the thinking , that there is life that does n't deserve to exist ( just like nazi-propaganda ) . 
  how is the oppinion of the daughter or a son of a nazi to be valued higher than anyone elses is another question in itself . 
  last but not least i say you can trust me . 
  of that i am sure and dare to say so . 
   in europe , things have become very serious in terms of the extent of islamophobia he is right about that . 
  turkey was supposed to be the choosen one , but erdogan choose to say goodby to democracy . 
  not all is lost . 
  one day turkey will have a chance again . 
  there is lots of resistance against him . 
  the german example proves that there is always a second chance . 
  i do n't like nestl\u00e9 , because they still want to privatize water ( if they ever accomplish that , air is next ? ), 
  if you google them in [ germany ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=nestle+produkte&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjk0afqsshtahxjcjokhsbidteq7akirw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=615 ) you get that they are quite detested . 
  [ list of nestl\u00e9 brands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nestl%c3%a9_brands ), 
  i would feel better if le pen had won the first round , because i believe more voters would then try to prevent her in the second round . 
  i think it is dangerous to expect macron to win . 
  many potential voters may be complacent know . 
  wcgw ? 
   herman van veen he is great . 
  the best . 
  ( i dislike the donald even more now , because i just realised that * great and the best * sounds satirical . ), 
  but who ever gets the chance should see one of his concerts . 
  he is reallyreallyreally good . 
  you should post andreas hofer , 
  one of my favourite . 
  der waldgang is a great book . 
  do you know the term habak ? 
  it 's how turk-germans called themselves . 
  it 's some sort of mint/nane/yarpuz ? 
  with time it became a slur term , by that the germans called the turks . 
   call themselves kanake too . 
  wonder why . 
  maybe the same reason why blacks adress themselves as ni ** er . 
  thank you very much . 
  ctrl d. 
  well , i am quite sure if you google translate an answer you will be able to get the gist of it . 
  and you can always ask for support in r/de or r/germany . 
  someone usually helps  edit : if your post will be taken down , because reasons , you can also try / r/askeurope, 
  great question , but i do n't know . 
  i skimmed through the faq 's of the most important institutes but could not find an answer . 
  the faq 's suggest that east and west are based on where you live right now , which would make sense in a way ( migration is minor and most seem to agree that the more important differences are to be found in north vs. south . 
  fun fact : mostly young women migrate , not the young men ) . 
  i suggest you ask the institutes yourself . 
  i link below the contact-websites of the most important ones . 
  https://www.forsa.de/kontakt/ http://www.forschungsgruppe.de/kontakt/ https://www.infas.de/ueber-infas/kontakt/ http://www.infratest-dimap.de/kontakt/ http://www.ifd-allensbach.de/service/english/contact.html https://www.tns-emnid.com/kontakt/index.asp  sehr geehrte damen und herren ,   mein name ist umbrella guns und ich habe eine frage bez\u00fcglich der methodologie ihrer umfragen in bezug auf die definition west - und ostdeutsche . 
    mit freundlichen gr\u00fc\u00dfen    umbrella guns . . and above a suggestion for an e-mail in german . 
  one could think that , but  the [ currywurst ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/currywurst ) is an icon of german popular culture . 
  you can buy the currywurst germany-wide . 
  the discussion is who invented it first or if it is a beef - or pork-based wurst . 
  some people will judge your charakter on the latter . 
  after thoughtfull consideration : hold mine bier [ ^ while ^ i 'm ^ on ^ my ^ way ^ to ^ k\u00f6nigsberg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bojwcswnzee ), 
   the report button is not the `` i 'm triggered '' button . 
  what triggers me is the fact that  hold my beer is already a thing . 
  what shall we use when germony votes ? 
  hold my currywurst ? 
  if the righteous leave who will fight for freedom ? 
  happy eastern nonetheless . 
  i think that this makes sense and even if you were against brexit you have a ) still to live in your country and b ) you are duty bound to make things work ( even if you do n't believe in them ) . 
  last but not least the petty annoyances in this sub . 
  ad nauseam , ad hominem , you name it . 
  for me personally as an europe-supporter it gets embarrasing what nonsense i have to read by my partisans . 
  awesome . 
  et tu corporate . 
  i wish you a pleasant surprise and the best of luck . 
  the very first picture is like `` accidentally 70s '' . 
   i hope you did n't spill any guiness . 
  lol . 
  fair point . 
  confession is not enough though , you ought to repent . 
  everyone i know of only regrets the headache . 
  ( the shop is ) closed today , because yesterday . 
  something seems odd . 
  but i ca n't quite put my finger on it . 
  w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk . 
   4 free days in a row . 
  ^ dont ^ hate ^ me, 
  what shall i say ? 
  i am a catholic after all and i like beer or wine or ... you know the struggle . 
  we ought to be good , but sinning is just too pleasurable . 
   for the feedback and :( on the emergency part . 
     we have much in common . 
   i particularly like the constant coughing part after the declaration to be fit for presidency . 
  you deserve it . 
  i do n't know why , but whenever there are 3 free days in a row , we germans go nuts and shop like crazy . 
  it is as if the collective subconscious fears to die of hunger . 
  it 's measures like this , which usually backfire . 
  if i were to live in an overzealous country i would `` boose up '' the week before , just to make sure i have alcohol , if i wanted it . 
  the mere fact that i would have lot 's of alcohol now and a free day would made me drink it . 
  so now i would be drunk even though i might not had a single glas of wine througout eastern . 
  it 's somewhat typical for germany and years of green-winged policies let to that outcome . 
  even non-greens usually downvote any comment in this regard . 
  nuclear energy = devils work . 
  we ca n't be wrong . 
  environmentaly we are great . 
  we are the best .
