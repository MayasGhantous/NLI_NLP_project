  everyone knows ... uups :(, 
  thank you for posting . 
  to this day it 's always tough for me to discover another war-crime i did n't know about yet . 
  especially if it is written in such a personal story . 
  that the article ended in a happy note makes me happy too . 
    since 2005 , the school has commemorated those who suffered there via an annual athletics event . 
  this is an unusual tribute , but apt in one sense . 
  among the first german words harry ever learned , hearing it constantly , was `` schnell ! '' ( `` quick ! '' ) , the speed he was always expected to move . 
  now , he and his fellow bunker builders are honoured by a 5km race every april . 
    in 2015 , it was renamed the harry callan run . 
   if you feel the need to downvote i did n't downvote you . 
  i upvoted you indeed . 
  the law in germany ( to my knowledge ) : if a picture is focused on a person or group then blurring is advised . 
  it 's not really a privacy thing but that you own all rights on your face/visage ( nobody is supposed to make such a picture and for example sell it ) you can make a picture with a person or lots of persons in it without the focus . 
  a real holiday without work ( no w\u00f6rk , w\u00f6rk ? 
  wtf : what [ kind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmzurxlzqkk ) of a german are you ? ) . 
  we all have our national holidays , but i believe such a real holiday would strengthen europeanness . 
  probably nobody would say no to an additional holiday . 
  so how about switching a holiday ( for example : we germans switched the holiday bu\u00df - und bettag for german unity day ) . 
  in germany we could switch christi himmelfahrt for the anticipated european holliday ( the catholic church will probably excommunicate me ) . 
  ( o_o ) why switching ? 
  i guess , if one would like to give a [ petition ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/20150201pvl00037/petitions ) to the european parliament the odds would be better ? 
  how should we call that holiday ? 
  do n't know , day of european unity ? 
  give me your thoughts please . 
  what date should it be ? 
  personnaly i would like the 17th of july , but if you have a better idea please say so . 
  most hardworking people i 've ever met . 
  i only know those who fled the shah and for that particular group we refer to as perser ( persians ) . 
  well , i always claim british understatement . 
  it 's not bad . 
  we were bigger once . 
  every discounter in germany , and most supermarkets , sell it at least once a year , usually by the start of the barbecue season . 
  it 's a thing for roughly about 10 years now , so very simular to your perception . 
  my friedrich will always be stupor mundi , ( historical nickname ) holy roman emperor frederick ii ( 1194 -- 1250 ), 
  [ peter k\u00fcrten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_k%c3%bcrten ) he inspired the famous [ fritz lang movie `` m '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m_\\ ( 1931_film \\ ) ) and one of the greatest songs of all time by [ randy newman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txyin2nowre ), 
  yes . 
  vancouver , jasper , banff and calgary come to mind . 
  some do , others do n't . 
   even the germans should be happy that they did n't win even the germans ~ ~ should be ~ ~ are happy that they did n't win . 
  in german , like someone is stretching the vowels too long . 
  wine or bier ? 
  i am in favour of it . 
  yes . 
  in germany everybody ( the vast majority ) is against it . 
  the german word atomkraft ( atom-power ) is dispized . 
  but i think that the using of coal is unaccaptable also nowadays . 
  the power of the atom could be different things than uranium . 
  you probably heard of thorium . 
  i approve that there is at least experimental research again . 
  problem being , it was n't popular because nobody could figure out how to make bombs out of it . 
  no prob as i am concerned . 
  you do n't need rivers ( water ) as necessarly as for cooling with uranium . 
  there are still quite a lot of problems to be solved . 
  it 's use would be the nitrate , so there are corrosion questions . 
  i like it most because a gau ( design basis accident ( dba ) ) is n't possible . 
  well , then there is wendelstein ( you are our only hope ) . 
   still a long way from useble . 
  fission , fusion you name it . 
  still a lot to be learned . 
  i am very much for renewable energy also ( it 's logic ) . 
  there as well a lot has to be done , until we have a stable power grid by only using those . 
  this is getting too long ... 
  i just realized , this also rhymes with ein pfennig and ` ne d-mark , 
  well , well , well . 
  i for one ( in debate ) always regret the [ kleindeutsche l\u00f6sung ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lesser_germany ) instead of the [ gro\u00dfdeutsche l\u00f6sung ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gro%c3%9fdeutsche_l%c3%b6sung ) . 
  this is about 1848 . 
  i just realised that the wiki in english for the gro\u00dfdeutsche l\u00f6sung is called [ unification of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany ) . 
  this is complicated in english . 
  my lament goes like `` if we would have had the gro\u00dfdeutsche l\u00f6sung ( 1848 ) instead of the kleindeutsche l\u00f6sung ( 1871 ) we would have had avoided the gro\u00dfdeutsches reich ( 1933 ) . '', 
   if scholarship goes through good for you . 
   shooting termite in the forest for fun on a weekly basis like the rednecks they are . 
  well we germans have rednecks too https://youtu.be/bnqxid_abme?t=151, 
  i give it a solid 7 of very pleasantly surprised . 
  this was sung by the men and women who were chosen to create the grundgesetz ( basic law for the federal republic of germany ) in their first meeting as a measure to create unity and to remember what is at stake by doing so . 
   because the lord does n't close his door on anyone :p lol \u00b3, 
  most germans grow herbs even if they own no garden . 
  you can buy them in almost every discounter or supermarket in little flower pots . 
  german balconies are full of them . 
  i dare to say everyone has basil and chives . 
  if ones balcony is big enuogh some even have some fruit shrubberies like blueberries or lemon . 
  happy canadaday by the way , 
  probably \u00e4 \u00f6 \u00fc, 
   `` under the tuscan sun '' and `` la dolce vita '' are movies , not real life . 
  i do n't believe you . 
  you just want the good stuff all for yourself . 
  i support worldpeace . 
  vermont or austin texas . 
  i loved it once . 
  it is indeed unwatchable nowadays because of ads . 
  would they want it ? 
  would n't that clash with a traditional nomadic lifestyle ? 
  a good idea out of times when nobody could foresee small electronic devices that will do your math , translate for you and whatnot . 
  today ? 
  probably obsolete . 
  what can i say ? 
  some of us ( cough , cough ) are so ardent and passionnate while making love , that sometimes whole bookcases topple down ... , 
  there is an ongoing joke in germany that people start to name their children after the ikea-furnishings they had sex on . 
  like billy , malm , kivik ... you get the gist of it . 
  you might try / r/eulaw,
