  they will be treated like any new member according to the regulations that will be in place at that particular time . 
   stranded not only once but twice  but to answer you . 
  very remote areas that are hard to reach seem to have dialects that are even more unique than others . 
  the mountains probably hindered people to interact more with similar german speaking languages . 
  the saxon dialect for example is quite different from other german ones . 
  they have mountainous regions as well . 
  welcome to germany and have a nice day . 
  german tv is popular but the quality ( of most ) is n't . 
  it is a concern , because of the german pension system where the money is not safe-tied . 
  it works like this : those who are working today pay ( through taxation ) the pension of todays retiered person , instead of using the tax money to build capital when todays tax-payers retire . 
  it is a system that works like this since adenauer ( before birth control pills ) . 
  adenauer once said : `` the people will always have children . '', 
  in the 70s the significance of the anti-baby-pill ( german term for contraceptives ) was realised and since then the debate goes on of how to change our pyramid scheme . 
  only 47 years later and no sollution in sight , because politicians are myopic . 
  imigration could be a sollution , but it is a ongoing debate as well , because the immigrant has to work and pay taxes of course . 
  my sollution would be : instead of giving kindergeld ( special payment per head of a child ) , we should try to make having a child profitable . 
  how ? 
  every euro you spend on the child gives you a tax return of 110 % . 
  not only 100 % but 110 % . 
  quite naturally only the wealthy ( or better the tax-payer ) would profit , because only they pay taxes and that is why it wont happen , because every party left of the cdu deems this unsocial . 
  i admit it is ( and even the cdu/csu is probably against it ) . 
  another ( dystopian ) policy could be to start a ( fake ? ), 
  discussion about a ban of getting children . 
  mindset behind that is if you taketh away , maybe people would want it more ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hidden_champions scroll down . 
  there is a list . 
  we have something similar in germany called [ klosterfrau melissengeist ] ( http://imgur.com/a/py89f ) . 
  marketed towards older ladies , supposedly helping with all sorts of ailments , in truth schnaps . 
  that is true . 
  people who are religious are healthier according to studies as well . 
  why is always the question . 
  my guess is that one has purpose and a determination in life that `` things '' make sense in the end . 
  if one has that living ( and suffering ) is easier . 
   viable treatment and that you can get subsidised treatment do you mean health insurance pays for it ? 
   bioenergetics holy moly . 
  this sounds like dowsing . 
  are you my mom ? 
   homeopathy when discussed the pro homeopathy `` arguments '' are very often treated like faith . 
  as it was said by wiser men before me : faith is nice , but faith is quite literally the absence of knowledge . 
  the totschlagargument ( killer argument ) is also placebo . 
  [ placebo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/placebo ) is nice also . 
  but for every good thing there is always a dark side . 
  in this case [ nocebo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nocebo ) . 
  and because placebo and nocebo equal each other out , nothing is gained . 
  cupping , kuppaus we call it schr\u00f6pfen . 
   alcohol and garlic you must be very healthy ^ ^ because ^ ^ of ^ ^ the ^ ^ alkohol, 
  thank you once again . 
  hahaha . 
  me and a friend ( let 's call him hans ) visit an old childhood buddy in virginia . 
  we do a barbeque and childhood buddy burns the hot dogs . 
  hans declares `` i wont eat that , because cancer '' , while smoking a cigarette . 
  first of all the wording : the salmon as a fresh water fisch is called lachs , and the salmon in salt water is called salm in the german language . 
  the ( fresh water ) lachs is always ( 90 % + ) eaten raw . 
  he is cut in thin slices an placed either on bread or r\u00f6sti / kartoffelpuffer . 
  the white stuff is a horseradish-sauce ( in a mild form ) pure or with different flavours ( like appel , or mustard , or onion ) . 
  the salm is always ( 90 % + ) cooked or grilled . 
  there are numerous recepies . 
  almost never [ served as a steak ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rvxwt ) like in the us . 
  i eat it every other month . 
  it is indeed expensive , if you want the real thing . 
  there is a big industry in aquaculture of salmonids , but those do n't taste as good as free born ones . 
  the farming ones are a lot cheaper and can be bought in every discounter in germany ( but they just do n't taste good in my opinion ) . 
  that is ( allegedly ) true . 
  those are called festbiere and can be bought as bottled beer as well . 
  it 's like a `` limited edition beer '' . 
  i wrote allegedly because since some of it will be bottled , those will quite likely have preservetives in it . 
  * pils : oettinger . 
  * export : paulaner . 
  humour ? 
  i googled it . 
  interesting concept , but i am still not sure if i understand it correctly . 
  what does it do ? 
  we have a lot sadly enough . 
  i will give you [ peter k\u00fcrten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_k%c3%bcrten ) because he is n't named yet . 
  most of the movie [ m \\ ( 1931 film \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m_\\ ( 1931_film \\ ) ) is based on him , as well as one of the most beloved songs by me . 
  [ in germany before the war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txyin2nowre ), 
  the stern but loving father who is totally overwhelmed by the bitch-wars of his daughters and the incompetence of his sons ( in secret monologues he laments about the inaptitude of his genes ) . 
  `` where have i go wrong ? '', 
  he secretly admires his nemisis , the ** single ** high life living brother namend uk/england brother in law is poland . 
  always enough conflict to be had . 
  yes . 
  european is soccer dominating , but they show american football and baseball , especially important games . 
  additionally cricket , golf , australian/new zealand football , pelota ( jai-alai ) and so on . 
  many irish pubs are half-sportsbarylike themself . 
  all sorts of commenwealth-sport events on sky ( a big pay-tv-outlet ) . 
  i even saw polo once . 
  there are quite a lot of words of jiddish ( jewish ) origin https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_deutscher_w%c3%b6rter_aus_dem_hebr%c3%a4ischen_und_jiddischen from my personal experience we use many english words and do n't really realise it anymore . 
  like `` sorry '' and `` cool '' and `` fuck '' . 
  in namibia a girl ( german-namibian/deutsch-s \u00fcdwester ) accused me of not speaking proper german anymore . 
  yes . 
  in germany every city with 400 k inhabitants or higher has at least 1 sports bar american style with burgers , onion rings and us-beer . 
   i 'd like to qoute [ georg hackl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georg_hackl ) : american beer ? 
  the successful attempt to dilute water .

  what makes you stick around ? 
  i like grazy ideas and sometimes they pop up in this sub . 
   what could use an improvement ? 
  the upvote-downvote mechanic . 
  maybe only upvotes possible until subscribed ? 
   what do you think about the traffic here ?
