  too many answers , too few ? 
  seems about right to me . 
  even new questions show on the front page . 
  i like that because i am lazy and do n't have to shuffle by new . 
    would you say your country has a strong enough presence here ? 
  i do n't care , because i know how my landsm\u00e4nner / frauen think . 
  i cherish the views of others ( europeans and the world ) more . 
  what made up my mind was actually the second caller of the talk show . 
  his talking gains frequency and becomes more erratic and louder , so my subconscious probably just waits for the final outburst allahu akbar . 
   so if you listen from about 6:20 you could really drop the occasional allahu akbar at the end of the sentence . 
  [ 6:20 ] ( https://youtu.be/a_y_esokqjm?t=381 ) ... the moderator says inbetween tak , and that always sounds czech or polnish to me . 
  the portugese part i gave because sometimes russian sounds like portugese and vice versa . 
  kottan is the best . 
  inspektor gibt 's kan. . and for germany maybe derrick . 
  the first seasons of the 70s are kafkaesque . 
  then there is monaco franze and kir royal . 
  best scene ever from [ kir royal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldqyqls2thm ) because it is so true . 
  for germans comparison-websites are a thing , but not many know about it that from my experience you can find the best pricing at google flights . 
  https://www.google.de/flights/ have n't been to japan yet . 
  like arabic-russian-portugese, 
  it helps to suppress humour and keeps us angry . 
  the way any good german must be .

  has any of you ever complained about the size of your flag on this subreddit ? 
  what if it were an additional holiday from the european parliament to the european people ? 
  how about to petition for an additional holiday ? 
  there are a number of castles i love . 
  i give you two that are not mentioned yet . 
  [ monts\u00e9gur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ch%c3%a2teau_de_monts%c3%a9gur ) , because [ catharism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catharism ) and templar and stuff . 
  [ castel del monte , apulia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castel_del_monte,_apulia ) , because [ friedrich ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_ii,_holy_roman_emperor ) my favourite kaiser by far . 
  he was indeed [ stupor mundi ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stupor_mundi ) . 
  i am sorry , but no . 
  it 's more like the holy roman empire germanics . 
  but you could fake beeing one of those . 
  you have to adress the swiss guard in german . 
  cool . 
  it is in tallinn right ? 
  when in rome give it a try and tell us about it . 
  great . 
  excellent . 
  most kindle users know it but for example almost all philosophical books and texts cost [ 0.00 euro on amazon ] ( https://www.amazon.de/s/ref=sr_st_price-asc-rank?__mk_de_de=%c3%85m%c3%85z%c3%95%c3%91&amp;keywords=philosophie&amp;fst=as%3aoff&amp;rh=n%3a186606%2ck%3aphilosophie%2cp_n_binding_browse-bin%3a600849031&amp;qid=1490900411&amp;sort=price-asc-rank ), 
  i have no idea . 
  but you are very likely right . 
  in germany the friedhofsordnung regulates that to my knowledge . 
  so it is not unheard of that a catholic is buried in a protestant cemetary or vice versa . 
  i think there is an italian saying like : `` in germany even the catholics are protestant '' . 
  cool it is . 
  i totally forgot . 
  what a great time to be alive . 
  in the past , if you died ( as a teuton ) in rome you even had the right to be buried there . 
  but i ca n't find any information if that is still the case . 
  i simply copy-paste translated the wiki-page . 
  the key is german speaking . 
  for example the wiki says deutschschweizer but i doubt that they would deny let 's say a genevan if he/she speaks german . 
  i should by a boat . 
  you are absolutely wrong . 
   because of its historical roots , the term teutonico includes not only the modern germans , but also all those who live in the historic german cultural area , including austrians , south tyroleans , alsatians , german-swiss , liechtenstein , luxembourg and german-speaking belgians ; fiamminghi includes the flemish and dutch . 
  i am no student no more , but i like to prep as well . 
  do you know r/mealprepsunday / ? 
  peer pressure . 
  1 januar ( hartung , ice moon , austrian and swiss german this month is called january only , rare in southern german language ) named after janus , the protector of the city gates , god of the entrance and entrance , in the transcendent sense of the beginning and the end , represented with two faces , looks on two sides , namely forward and backward . 
  latin ianua `` threshold '' ( to the new year ) . 
  2 februar ( hornung , schmelzmond , taumond , narrenmond , rebmond , hintester , austrian also feber , swiss also horner ) the purification or atonement ceremonies , because at the end of the year the feast of february was made for the purification of the living and the atonement of the deceased ( lat . 
  februare `` clean '' ) . 
  3 m\u00e4rz ( lenzing , lenzmond ) named after mars , the god of war and vegetation . 
  in the ancient roman calendar , the year began with march , which results in the shift of the numerical months september to december and february as the end of the year . 
  since 153 bc , the consuls elected for a year have held their office in rome on 1 january , which soon became natural as the beginning of the year . 
  4 april ( launing , easter moon ) is derived from lat . 
  aperire `` open '' , the month of opening or blooming . 
  5 mai ( winnemond ( weidemonat : redone to wonnemonat today ) , blumenmond ) named after the roman goddess maia . 
  6 juni ( brachet , brachmond ) named after juno , a roman deity , to which most of the properties of the greek gods ' queen hera were transferred . 
  7 juli ( hay , hay , heumond ) originally quintilis , the `` fifth month '' . 
  according to him , this month since 44 bc was called julius . 
  8 august ( ernting , ernemond , bisemond ) this was originally the sixth month , accordingly called sextilis , of the ancient roman calendar . 
  he was renamed augustus in 8 bc to honor the first roman emperor augustus . 
  21 years later , 14 ad , the august became the death of his patron . 
  ( the sequence of events seems strange , but at least the last year may be considered safe . ), 
  9 september ( scheiding , herbstmond ) the seventh month ( latin septem = `` seven '' ) in the roman calendar . 
  on this and the following month names one can see that one began with the counting originally in the month of march . 
  he was to be named after the emperor tiberius . 
  10 oktober ( gilbhart , gilbhard , weinmond ) the eighth month ( latin octo = `` eight '' ) according to the roman calendar . 
  again , the name domitianus could not prevail . 
  11 november ( nebelung , windmond , wintermond ) the ninth month ( lat . 
  novem = `` nine '' ) according to the roman calendar . 
  12 dezember ( julmond , heilmond , christmond , dustermond ) the tenth month ( latin decem = `` ten '' ) according to the roman calendar . 
  as it was said before there are a number of good american restaurants in germany . 
  but there is no decent tex-mex in germany and most of europe i presume . 
  also no cajun cuisine . 
  i say tex-mex and cajun would really score in germany . 
  maybe one of the following is interesting for you http://lang-8.com/ https://www.duolingo.com/ and you should ask r/askuk /,

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_investigators ) with 14 years of age i discovered lotr and from then on fantasy and science fiction . 
  i have enough issues with my own country , so i do n't really like to impose my views on others . 
  but you asked so i reply with : no torture , no death penalty . 
  the basics i would wish any country to follow . 
  very popular in germany .
