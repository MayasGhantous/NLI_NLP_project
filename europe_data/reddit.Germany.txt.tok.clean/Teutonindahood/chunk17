  just like antiques roadshow we have a broadcast named [ kunst & krempel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvd1zsmnqku ) ( art & junk ) . 
  lots and lots of small and big fleamarkets usually on weekends . 
  the purchase of pocket knives ( smaller than 12 cm ) is legal . 
  [ gun legislation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_legislation_in_germany )  the weapons act of 2002 increased the age requirements for licensed hunters and competition shooters . 
  it also introduced the requirement of a psychological evaluation for persons under the age of 25 to fulfil the requirement of personal adequacy for large-bore firearms . 
    the first amendment became effective on april 1 , 2008 . 
  the intention of that amendment was to ban certain kinds of weapons like airsoft-guns , tasers , imitation firearms ( anscheinswaffen ) and knives with blades longer than 12 cm from public places . 
  they may still be carried in sealed wrappings and for professional or ceremonial purposes . 
  their use on private premises and in non-public places like gun clubs is not restricted . 
  after the [ beer hall putsch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beer_hall_putsch ) hitler should have been deported to austria according to the law at that time . 
  how would history have changed ? 
  instead he wrote mein kampf and well ... 
  the wiki page of his [ naturalization ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/einb%c3%bcrgerung_adolf_hitlers ) is in the german language only but an interesting read if you google translate it . 
  excerpt :  on the 8th / in november 1923 the hitler-ludendorff coup was unsuccessful , and hitler was condemned in a trial for treason and imprisoned on landsberg fortress . 
  although hitler was still an austrian citizen at this time , and the republic 's protection law in such a case mandated expulsion , this was not the case .

  nonsense par excellence . 
  we should get rid of it . 
  not the last names , but the first names . 
  there are a lot of schanice and schaninas nowadys instead of janice and janina . 
   a boy named \u00dcffes   elias-krishna n\u00f6lte . 
  yes , they are more and more often , these very special children : they are given the names and names of the proud parents , which not only make them unique , but also to potential victims of bullying by their peers in kindergartens , kindergartens and school yards . 
  why do parents do this to their children ? 
  an explanation for the pleasure of the exotic name might be the now understimated truth that boys with the fashionable names kevin , justin , dustin or jason and girls , which are called chantal , jacqueline , samantha or mandy , disproportionately often come from the so-called educationally remote population strata . 
  academic children , on the other hand , prefer to have `` simple '' ( fashion ) names such as lukas , jonas or robert respectively anna , marie or paula - which is now proven - mostly easier in life . 
    there remains the question of how \u00dcffes is going to develop , a handsome blond villain of perhaps four years , who lately mixed up the waiting room of my dentist with building bricks . 
  '' \u00dcffes , '' his blond mother said again and again , `` stop it , or the mamma will be sad . '', 
  but \u00dcffes wanted to see his mother cry . 
  but i was only interested in the name i had never heard before , and so i asked the mother where this `` ueffes '' came from and how you would write it . 
  `` from france , '' the mother replied astonishedly , spelling him willingly , `` y-v-e-s . '' ah , i thought , so did montand , and had no more questions . 
  [ the sauce ] ( http://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/article108213054/ein-junge-namens-ueffes.html ), 
  the sentence `` du bist gut zu v\u00f6geln '' is ambigious .

  the history behind that is the german [ schrebergarten ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kleingarten ) culture . 
  to make it short , the [ bundeskleingartengesetz ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundeskleingartengesetz ) facilitates or promotes the lease of gardens with the purpose that you plant and grow mainly groceries and produce .

   1.2 ) questions should relate to europe or european subdivisions . 
  questions should ask europeans about europe , or ask europeans about non-european things , or ask non-european people questions about european things . 
  european subdivisions are for example asking germans about germany , or asking germans about non-german things etc. 
  this is so german  i would declare you to be an honorary german if it where in my power ,

  well , actually a baverian satirical comedian gerhard polt did a piece about that in honour of the swedish royal-family once . 
  he speaks swedish and performs in sweden from time to time . 
  it refers to the 30 years war of course . 
  once again a german fails in the attempt of humour .

  i would like the option `` none of the above '' on the ballot paper though . 
  well , yes and no . 
  if you take the wiki-link to perfume :   there is much confusion over the term `` cologne , '' which has three meanings . 
  the first and oldest definition refers to a family of fresh , citrus-based fragrances distilled using extracts from citrus , floral , and woody ingredients . 
  supposedly these were first developed in the early 18th century in cologne , germany , hence the name . 
  this type of `` classical cologne '' describes unisex compositions `` which are basically citrus blends and do not have a perfume parent . 
  '' [ 14 ] examples include m\u00e4urer & wirtz 's 4711 ( created in 1799 ) , and guerlain 's eau de cologne imp\u00e9riale ( 1853 ) . 
    in the 20th century , the term took on a second meaning . 
  fragrance companies began to offer lighter , less concentrated interpretations of their existing perfumes , making their products available to a wider range of customers . 
  guerlain , for example , offered an eau de cologne version of its flagship perfume shalimar . 
  in contrast to classical colognes , this type of modern cologne is a lighter , diluted , less concentrated interpretation of a more concentrated product , typically a pure parfum . 
  the cologne version is often the lightest concentration from a line of fragrance products . 
  [ 14 ]   finally , the term `` cologne '' has entered the english language as a generic , overarching term to denote a fragrance worn by a man , regardless of its concentration . 
  the actual product worn by a man may technically be an eau de toilette , but he may still say that he `` wears cologne . '', 
  a similar problem surrounds the term `` perfume , '' which can be used a generic sense to refer to fragrances marketed to women , whether or not the fragrance is actually an extrait . 
   firstworldproblems, 
  lol . 
  well who would n't love robots ? 
  in germany the kobold ( vorwerk ) is prefered , but i could n't tell which works better . 
  this feels like advertising , but i can not stress enough the superiority of a quality vacuum cleaner from miele . 
  it 's a difference like day and night . 
  bonus question : [ eau de cologne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eau_de_cologne ), 
  my cultural region exists as such . 
  the wiki explains it quite accurately . 
  https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/assia_renana https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhenish_hesse another one from germany whose people identify themselves with it , is the rhineland . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhineland https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/renania, 
   hahaha its not that simple  true . 
  it is n't . 
  i gave you a very german answer . 
  we are at times unbearably precise to the point . 
  i still say go with your passion , but for your sake i will elaborate a little about what i know about the russian language and the german one . 
  i had to learn a litte bit of russian and i travelled the ex-sowietunion a bit . 
  if you have interest in russian literature it is fun to converse with russians about that . 
  russians are very patient and helpful to people who make the effort to learn their language . 
  germans not so much . 
  if we understand and speak english we usually try to turn the conversation into english . 
  if you are choosing german here my lpt : say that it is verboten for you to speak english and bitte be patient and talk slowly with me . 
  verboten is a key word in german and it truly works , but it works only with german germans , not with the austrian ones . 
  there is a saying in german `` es hat keinen sinn \u00fcber politik oder religion zu streiten '' .
