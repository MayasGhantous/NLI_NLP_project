  it makes no sense to argue about politics or religion . 
  that is not true at all . 
  we do it with a passion . 
  we love it . 
  so if you into ranting about politics ( a redditor surley must be ) , learning german might be fun . 
  germans will give you the shit about american politics ( not necessarily because of trump , it 's a reflex ) . 
  but we have a buddy system . 
  you being the minority one will take your side no matter what , even if he or she does n't share your weltview . 
  if you are not a climate change denier everything will work that way . 
  the best thing about the german language and thinking in german is metaphysics . 
  ernst j\u00fcnger said there are 3 types of germans . 
  the worker , the unknown soldier , and the forrestwalker ( der waldg\u00e4nger ) . 
  i believe him to be right . 
  so if you into metaphysics , zeitgeist , philosophy , weltverst\u00e4ndnis and ecology , then german is the language for you . 
  according to the unesco they are part of the immaterial cultural heritage . 
  https://www.unesco.de/en/presse/pressearchiv/2016/genossenschaften-aufgenommen.html i like them very much but i have not worked for one . 
  lots of banks in germany are cooperatives . 
  volksbanken and raifeisenbanken for example . 
  it is a very good legal form for start ups i would say . 
  on a side note . 
  there is still clay to be claimed . 
  a fun game by a fellow redditor https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5p7xbn/lets_play_a_fun_little_game/, 
  you are fascinated by the russian language . 
  you think german to be a boring language . 
  do you see the answer ?!? 
  i do . 
  that i know and one of the reasons i was deceived for so long . 
  the `` g '' in igbo is silent = ibo . 
  but i always wondered why is it spelled wrong in german . 
  the phrase `` vom stamm der ibo '' is ment literally . 
  not quite what you wanted op but der stamm der ibo . 
  the tribe of the ibo people . 
  i always believed there to be such a nation/tribe . 
  i was absolutly dumbstrucked to learn that ibo is supposed to mean ** i ** ** b ** efore ** o ** thers and is used merely as a witty way to point out selfishness . 
  it 's verboten . 
  in austria it is mandatory for the businesses or companies to state the ( minimum ) wage they are willing to pay you , on their job-offering . 
  i like that , as it gives the applicant the upper hand . 
  you can decide for yourself if you are willing to work for that amount and if `` overqualified '' you might renegotiate a higher wage , if you sense that they want you . 
  i am a german . 
  in germany the applicant is very often requested to state his `` salary-wish '' . 
  i have no idea , but to suggest to post your question to r/eulaw . 
  maybe they can at least give you a tip whom to ask ? 
  your comment made me smile , because of `` comrade '' . 
  in german that is genosse , while the german word kamerad , well everyone knows about the german past . 
  but nonetheless . 
  in necessary things unity , in doubtful things liberty , in all things , charity . 
  it is a free europe . 
  of course you may give your opinion on that . 
  not only about the increase . 
  you do n't need 4 nights of london . 
  you could put that 1 day towards amalfi coast . 
  as i observed it often , i asked as polite as i could . 
  the best explanations from my point of view were , 1 ) etiquette : as the west was won , people usually were handeling big-ass bowie knives ( or the like ) . 
  to pick a piece of meat and showeling it in your mouth with one of those seems `` barbaric '' . 
  2 ) peaceful intent : you decisively empty your weapon-hand of any weapon in polite company . 
  you emphasise this further by blocking your weapon hand with the fork . 
  hard to explain , if one has not seen that . 
  i youtubed and voila : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fypq2qhrzni, 
  i hate that . 
  i called it `` blickfaschismus '' . 
  in comparison of europe to let 's say the us , i would say the use of cutlery . 
  the us being the unique one of course . 
  i was always fascinated by that . 
  when ( most of ) a us-american eats he/she cuts the meat in little pieces , then puts down the knife and you put one hand on your lap and eat only with the one hand holding the fork .

  germany has in abundance , all of the things in which you are interested in . 
  your name does you justice . 
  as i choose to believe in the good of people i answer you nontheless . 
  as it was mentioned before you could google it all by yourself . 
  but it takes me only 2 minutes to gather some information . 
  so here you go ( the german key word in regard to hiking ist called wandern ) . 
  http://www.top-trails-of-germany.de/en/welcome.html http://www.wanderbares-deutschland.de/ http://allexciting.com/medieval-historical-festivals-europe/ if you are a troll you should consider living in island . 
  my experience is that sometimes they seem to be more french as the french themselves . 
  just as quebecois sometimes seem to be . 
  because diaspora ? 
  quite a few people here . 
  maybe some sort of sp\u00e4tzle ? 
  i know that there are various hungarian forms of it , like nokedli . 
  `` like a duck takes to water '', 
  we have torben/thorben in germany too . 
  i always guessed because of thor , but i never recognized the bear-part . 
  yep . 
  you are right . 
  i posted from memory and remembered it wrong . 
  in german the k\u00fcr is the old word for voting . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%bcr_ ( wahl ) thank you for replying . 
  no love for roland ? 
  i f i may ad something . 
  you may know that a valkyrie would lead one to valhalla if odin would demand it , because the fighter was such a good einherjer ( ein heer , one army ) . 
  in german a walk\u00fcre = wahl + k\u00fcren ( vote + giving ) . 
  edit : i am wrong look below, 
  i 'd like the 5 % election threshold at our national elections to be lowerd to 2 % . 
  trial . 
  error . 
  copy paste . 
  tradition .
