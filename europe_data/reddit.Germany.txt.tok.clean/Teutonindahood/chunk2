  til : it 's mandatory to wear pajamas while eating pizza in spain . 
   as long as she and hocke are there ; the movement will be forever completely useless i disagree . 
  i think the afd would do far worse in the public eye , if the leaders are only `` angry old men '' . 
  it 's great how many effort people put in aprils fool day . 
  i almost believed it . 
  are we the baddies ? 
  and metaphysically sound . 
  they can try that . 
  but would anybody believe them ? 
  nice . 
  but what would the a be that england is supposedly to give/have ? 
  divide et impera . 
  the romans are on our side . 
   let 's just hope that it does n't end with solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant . 
  i thought so , because if she were displeased that would be known widely . 
  she is very respected by all but the older generations adore her which explains those brexit-votes also in a way i guess . 
  religious fanatics who do n't hurt anyone and are genuinely nice and decent . 
  one of my favourite subreddits . 
  you tell me i 'd suggest . 
  is the brexit vote binding for all eternity and all future governments ? 
  what happens if scotland drops out and the queen would declare ( she is n't supposed to utter an oppinion , but what happens if she said : `` to loose the blue colour is an annus horribiles superior '' ) ? 
  what happens if ( for whatever reason ) the torries are overthrown by liberals or labour in the next two years ? 
  unlikely , i know . 
  but what if ? 
  you are right . 
  yup . 
  you better get rid of 'em, 
  i would promote vermont independence and anschlu\u00df on europe . 
  we would gain the bernie . 
  edit : and pennsylvanien . 
  philly cheese steak . 
  so lecker . 
  sure . 
  yes . 
  nice . 
  the exeption to the rule to betteridge 's law of headlines . 
  good guy lithuania . 
   who is able to speak oxford english ? 
  that is why we paired the statement ( dear britain , the door is still open ) with a typical german accent . 
  the british prime minister theresa may will file divorce from the eu on wednesday . 
  but many people in brussels and berlin do not want to believe in the brexit just yet . 
  because the eu 's second largest net contributor still could correct this historical error at any time during the negotiation phase . 
   only if they sign a quittung !, 
     should the uk at any point wish to rejoin the european union , it would need to make an application to do so . 
  personaly i would like the uk to come back one day . 
  but reallistically this day is very far away . 
  only one member-state has to say no , and i imagine that for example the poles will be unforgiving for a very long time if their expats have to leave britain due to brexit . 
  the turks have probaply a better chance to join . 
  :( sad . 
  the regime is `` all in '' . 
  they better hope to consolidate their power . 
  if not the democratic turks will not forget who did what . 
  i say bullshit as well . 
  i dated a kindergarten teacher once . 
  she told me the problem nowadays is that most children have no siblings , so they never learned to share before kindergarten . 
  sometimes all hell brakes lose therefore , and this nonsense seems to be the nonesensical sollution to ban toys to prevent `` all hell from breaking lose '' . 
  they would not dare . 
  [ we germans are not all smiles and sunshine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgauzm2posq ), 
  i need to be entertained . 
  i want to rant on the internet . 
  it 's my right . 
  well , we will see whats what tomorrow . 
  i hope there will be a mega-thread and live coverage . 
  this is appalling . 
  not only the sun but german media outlets as well . 
  i am ashamed . 
  this is gold . 
  one can support those too .

  nice provocation a la cuba-crisis 2.0 [ s-300 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-300_missile_system )  introduced in 1985 and is the only version thought to have been fitted with a nuclear warhead . 
  beautiful . 
  you should x-post to / r/europeanculture, 
  like the germans buy [ mr. burns nuklear plant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxejh0s4qdy ) ? 
  one can always hope . 
  well , nestl\u00e9 wants to privatize water and they have a history of dubious practises such as [ infant formula in africa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nestl%c3%a9_boycott ) and more recently [ chinese milk scandal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_chinese_milk_scandal ) . 
  bayer ag , because they want to purchase [ monsanto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monsanto ) . 
  i do n't mind that much their dna-meddeling in crops but their unethical behaviour towards farmers and so on . 
   i too believe in social responsibility . 
  therefore i boycott nestl\u00e9 and more recently the bayer ag , or as i call them `` monsanto leverkusen '' . 
  you may try a miele . 
  very ( very ) long read . 
  but somewhat fascinating and enthralling . 
   contrary to popular beliefs is it ? 
  i always believed it to be clear that hygene was introduced by ( enlightened ) islam . 
  the [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hygiene#history )  islamic hygienical jurisprudence   since the 7th century , islam has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene . 
  other than the need to be ritually clean in time for the daily prayer ( arabic : salat ) through wuzu and ghusl , there are a large number of other hygiene-related rules governing the lives of muslims . 
  a neat timeline with 16 pictures and explanations for my european brethren and sistren , in case of interest . 
  94 % very impressive .
