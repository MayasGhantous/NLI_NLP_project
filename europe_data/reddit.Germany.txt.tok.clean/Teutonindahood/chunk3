  anti-israelism = anti-semitism ? 
  if so , then his numbers are maybe right . 
  i would say that in germany anti-israelism is an expression mainly of the left-wing though . 
   there is a lot of muslim anti-semitism , especially from the extreme muslim community . '', 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_germany ) there are up to 5,7 % muslims in germany . 
  let 's say 2 % ? 
  are extremists . 
  i do n't know how they are statistically significant .

  lack of [ frustration tolerance ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/frustrationstoleranz )  the frustration tolerance is a personality characteristic that describes the individual ability to withstand a frustrating situation for a long time without distorting the objective factors of the situation . 
    the term coined by saul rosenzweig in 1938 denotes the ability to sustain long-term mental tensions resulting from the lack of motivation . 
  this is acquired to a certain extent in the course of the individualization process and can be determined by means of the picture frustration test . 
    a low frustration tolerance indicates an i-weakness . 
  through learning processes , the frustration tolerance can be strengthened , taking into account the reality principle , for example through rewards of rewards or reward reduction . 
  individuals with low levels of frustration tend to be more aggressive and avoidable . 
  the stronger the frustration tolerance is , however , the less aggressive behavior forms can be found . 
  thank you physics-bros .

   `` leader of the free world '' is a meaningless americanism . 
  we should start saying e pluribus unum of the reasonable minded . 
  haha . 
  why not both ? 
  excellent . 
  and the landscape is stunningly beautiful . 
  aww, 
  germany is no paradise . 
  there is a lot of embedded incompetence and outright stupidity in place . 
  no but the dog has a new collar . 
  therefore a new spying device must be placed . 
  he is well aware that a any british government will comply ( to a certain extent ) with the biddings of the financial sector , and that through them europe is able to influence the british in the negotiations to come .

   assassination attempt and resulting health issues   on 12 october 1990 , at the age of 48 , sch\u00e4uble was the target of an assassination attempt by dieter kaufmann , who fired three shots at him after an election campaign event attended by about 300 people in oppenau . 
  kaufmann injured a bodyguard , and severely injured sch\u00e4uble 's spinal cord and face . 
  it was the first attack on a political leader in the new unified germany . 
    sch\u00e4uble was left paralysed from the attack and has used a wheelchair ever since . 
  the would-be assassin was declared mentally ill by the judges , and committed to a clinic because of psychoneurosis . 
  he was released in 2004 . 
    meanwhile , sch\u00e4uble forced himself back to work within three months , even while he was still living in a rehabilitation unit , learning to manoeuvre while paralysed below the waist . 
  for his last rally in the 1990 elections , chancellor helmut kohl traveled to offenburg , where sch\u00e4uble made his first public appearance after the assassination attempt to a crowd of about 9,000 . 
  sch\u00e4uble is made of harder stuff . 
  jawoll . 
  if there is a next time , please consider giving them each a tulip .

  well this polish government will never align with putin .

  you have to love enthusiasm . 
   germans are n't freaking out when a politican holds a speech we did once , did n't really work in our favour . 
  either way the outcome , she will lose politically , from my point of view . 
  if she changes the mind of the american administration towards the eu this will be interpreted as `` to much german dominance '' in europe and if she ca n't she will obviously have failed .

  the article refers always to russia 's lawyer .
