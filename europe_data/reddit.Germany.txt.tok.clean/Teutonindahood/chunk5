  ban those ? 
  and get rid of airbnb ? 
  great . 
  the best . 
  everybody knows it . 
  the second picture would be very welcome in every part of the world but hardcore islamic states , i would guess . 
  this is a city in need for high-end tourism . 
  1 ) berlin 2 ) istanbul ... from my point of view . 
   i am okay to eat 2 more , right ? 
  right ? 
  absolutely . 
  the statistic demands it . 
  let ' not forget that it was britain that [ made in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/made_in_germany ) great again . 
   turkey is geographically located in close proximity to more than 75 % of the world 's proven oil and gas reserves . 
  its unique location provides opportunities for turkey in terms of ensuring its own energy supply security but also brings responsilibity to turkey with regard to regional energy security . 
  turkey continues to take steps to assume its responsibilities in this regard . 
  the last part of the sentence sounds ominous . 
   the german economics ministry want to create a nationwide database aimed at making it easier to block companies found guilty of fraud and other violations from receiving federal , state and local government contracts . 
  i would love it . 
  well , the last [ emperor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maximilian_i_of_mexico ) of mexico was maximilian i. 
  we might declare them honour-austrians . 
  well , of course they are not . 
  the big papers are somewhat split evenly between springer and left-wing . 
  small local papers on the other hand are overwhelmingly in the possesion of the spd . 
  you can look that up on the internet . 
  do n't know ? 
   uncontrollable bursts of laughter while reading . 
   i just remember that i had one issue in latin . 
  i grew up with them and as an adult i bought them all again . 
  they are even better now , because they are full of hidden humor . 
  for example the name of the british chief is sebigbos ( the big boss ) and so on . 
  i highly recommend to read them as a grown up . 
  you are great friends ( waving with a bottle ricard ) . 
  they like and hate themself ? 
  bu ... , but the donald said so . 
  from a german point of view this is quite revolutionary . 
  for decades german politicians underspend the military sector because of a number of rather influential `` peace '' organisations and anything military related would get a social uproar in media and the press . 
  this has changed ( overnight ) and i am quite baffled by it . 
  all the `` high energy '' might bedazzle the voters enough to make them notice , 
   the social democrats also question the urgency of an amendment . 
  psh ... technicality . 
  the question is , do you want 6 or 8 [ slices ] ( http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/07/22/pizza/ ) of pizza . 
  now that 's a pizza !, 
  i searched in hope for a eu-regulation that a pizza is supposed to be round shaped . 
  there is no such regulation . 
  my germanness is disappointed . 
  i am little bit at a loss . 
  do you party today , on the 16th of february or at the 11th of march ? 
  edit : now as i thought about it . 
  why not on all 3 dates ? 
  as a german i am against the outright ~ ~ burning ~ ~ banning of printed things . 
  i would suggest flairs like `` tabloid article '' or even `` unreliable tabloid article '' . 
  thank you for the link . 
  it gets more difficult each day to distinguish between truth , fake news , and click-bait nowadays . 
  i agree . 
  i like that quote though and always believed it to be made by ignazio silone , but it seems [ debated ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/talk:winston_churchill#the_fascists_of_the_future_will_be_called_anti-fascists ) who made it first . 
  from my point of view political correctness is equivalent to newspeak . 
  it backfires . 
  my germaness gets triggered . 
  logged in for `` what did he do today ? '', 
  ( the one across the pond ) ... and now i 'm sad :(, 
  my personal dislike with ( most ) politicians is , that nowadays there is too much reacting than acting . 
  this article sustains such nonsense . 
  72 years ago . 
  can you imagine ? 
  i will ( very likely ) live to be able to say 100 years ago in a few years . 
  very good news . 
  thank you , 
  does anyone know if the documentary `` cats of istanbul '' is finished ? 
  i wonder if poland will be blackmailed by him with the threat of giving new information about cia black sites and torture in poland . 
  boris you made a very very good point about the tragic destruction of democracy by ~ ~ the romans ~ ~ yourself , 
  my thinking is different . 
  i always assume an english politician to be an eton-alumni and then to be an oxbridge kind a guy . 
  therefore i found farage to be surprising . 
  well , dulwich belongs to the eton-group but you get the gist of my meaning . 
  excellent . 
  i know a thing or two about kajal and i am willing to share my knowledge , 
  may i suggest that we should have `` cultural exchange '' events with women subreddits as well as countries in the future . 
  i say bring it on . 
  destroy the eu . 
  i think it is funny how delusional some people are . 
  let us say they succeed and the eu goes down , who is to say that then nothing new would arise . 
  the absolut conviction that they would be on top then is ludicrous . 
  i am quite sure new eus would form and anybody who will suffer of the `` old eu '' beeing destroyed will remember who is to blame . 
  i did provide it . 
  that ca n't be it . 
  edit : i think the mods are overwhelmed by the forts-postings and fear shit-post content so much that sometimes wrong decissions are made . 
  hi , to bad . 
  i checked beforehand and did not see anything that would brake the rules . 
  but i do n't mind your action . 
  does anyone know how i could get a flair `` dinosaurs of europe '' ? 
  google translate : the real monster from transylvania hatzegopteryx is one of the most powerful animals that have captured the air in the history of the earth . 
  a find from romania shows that they could easily slay pony-sized prey . 
  with a wingspan of around twelve meters and a weight of up to 250 kilograms , hatzegopteryx is one of the largest flight dinosaurs of the cretaceous era . 
  however , while many of his relatives were able to capture fish and , if possible , small farm animals , this pterosaur could even kill species as large as ponies or smaller horses . 
  this suggests at least fossils that darren naish from the university of southampton and mark witton from portsmouth university were able to study and which originate from today 's transylvania . 
  the remnants indicate that hatzegopteryx was quite different from other flight dwellers . 
  while these were predominantly characterized by long necks and legs , hatzegopteryx possessed a short , strong neck with broad bones and a very broad mouth . 
  the species was thus probably more compactly built with strong back , swing and leg muscles , which contributed to its great weight despite the slight bones . 
  the vertebrae were reinforced by a sponge-like , stabilizing material , which cushioned the loads that occur during hunting .
