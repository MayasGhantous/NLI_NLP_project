  the large mouth also allowed the animals to kill much bigger prey than the other pterosaurs . 
  the site was part of an island called hateg in the tethys sea 70 million years ago , when hatzegopteryx lived . 
  previous fossil finds from the region are dominated by small dinosaur species , but large carnivores have not yet emerged from this time . 
  the pterosaurs were therefore probably the top robbers of the then ecosystem on hateg , so naish and witton . 
  similar to today 's marabus , they were probably strutting across the island and dropping the pony-sized dinosaurs , which they could swallow as a whole . 
  however , not all flightbirds were as large as hatzegopteryx or the related quetzalcoatlus . 
  it was not until 2016 that elizabeth martin-silverstone of the university of southampton and her colleagues described a species which at most reached the size of a gull or an eagle . 
  very nice . 
  you have a wes anderson-esque style . 
  they most certainly can try . 
  if it is not only big talk , then aiming at germany to destroy the eu would be the next logical step . 
  i say bring it on . 
  if they succeed , whose to say that germany and a new eu would not arise ? 
  they wont nuke us , so something new would be created . 
  and every european country that suffers because of the destruction of the old eu , will remember who is to blame . 
  `` the baddies '' ca n't ** t **** r ** i ** ump ** h. 
  we have lots of hipsters nowadays . 
  the majority of them are vegetarian , vegan or even frutarian . 
  so we are losing weight . 
  i had no idea that paris and london are way over the 10 million line already, 
  thank you for sharing . 
  you guys have it rough . 
  really rough . 
   i honestly very much doubt that parliament will vote against brexit i doubt that too . 
  when is the vote on that ? 
  have those who want to stay in the single market time to campaign for it , time to write to their mps . 
  time to demonstrate in numbers in front of the parliament ? 
  thank you . 
  this type of action reminds me of the peace march to aleppo . 
  i think they are near dresden right now . 
  if they ever get to syria let us hope we wont be in need of dr eva filipi . 
  yeah to czechia how is it that only the czech republic has an embassy left ? 
  do they have close cultural ties ? 
  does anyone know ? 
  edit : czech . 
  i unintentionally offended my brethren in beer . 
  do n't hate me . 
  you do n't . 
  i am sorry, 
  true . 
  i would confirm if i existed . 
  it 's fake , totally fake . 
  not only the language . 
  everything . 
  it 's the best fake , maybe even the bestest . 
  one dare not underestimate , the inherent power of the variety in bratwurst , for the democratic process . 
  can i haz ze philly cheese-steak ( so good ! ) ? 
  that is to say germany claims pennsilvanien . 
  lots of somewhat germans there . 
  the amish and mennonites come to mind . 
  the largest ancestry group are germans 28.5 % . 
  til wiliam penn who was not a german but he developed a forward-looking project for a united states of europe through the creation of a european assembly made of deputies that could discuss and adjudicate controversies peacefully . 
  he is therefore considered the very first thinker to suggest the creation of a european parliament . 
  most of us germans are very fond of the european parliament . 
  while i am at it . 
  i try to claim california for my austrian brethren because former gov. 
  ` nuff said . 
  i would like people to prosper . 
  on the islands as on the continent . 
  i am a firm believer of win-win situations . 
  in tit for tat one starts cooperative though , that 's why it worked well in business . 
  i do n't think the threat of a future tax-haven in the uk is a cooperative start . 
  i really like irish single malt . 
  before anyone gets a fit . 
  of course there is nothing wrong with scottish ones . 
  google translation us-ambassador : `` many of us say : thank god there is merkel '' die welt : the interview , given by president-elect donald trump of the `` bild '' and the london times , caused some unrest in europe . 
  how should we deal with this president ? 
  john b. emerson : i can understand the concerns of the europeans . 
  but there is a long way between the things that a future president is tweeting or in a comprehensive interview , and the policy that comes out when the very professional government apparatus of the us has dealt with the topics . 
  there is no such thing as congress has made its point of view , as are the consultants and office-holders a president is gathering around him . 
  in this case , there are a lot of internationalists among them , and especially people with whom the cohesion of nato is very important . 
  that is why i tell the people in europe : take a deep breath and look at the process . 
  listen to the inauguration speech . 
  look at the draft budget , which the new president has to submit in a month or two . 
  then you will see where your priorities really lie . 
  nato is so important to the national interests of the us that i can not imagine a fundamental change in our attitude towards it . 
  general james mattis , the nominated defense minister , was allied commander of nato after the fall of the wall . 
  he and the nominated foreign secretary , rex tillerson , have made it clear that our commitment to nato is not questionable . 
  die welt : have you learned anything about germany in your time , what surprised you , what you did not know before ? 
  emerson : my biggest surprise came six to eight weeks after my arrival - the deep emotional reaction of the german public to the matter with mrs. merkel 's mobile phone ... 
  die welt : they are referring to the allegations of nsa interception , which also involved telephone calls from the federal chancellor . 
  emerson : in other countries , they reacted more like the gendarme in the film `` casablanca '' , who exclaimed indignantly at his raid in humphrey bogart 's place : `` i am shocked that there is gambling . '', 
  although he always knew it . 
  in germany it was different , even if the many in washington first synonymous for such a gendarmen speech held . 
  so this was my first job here : my people explain that the german is very close , also for historical reasons . 
  and that we need to be much more specific . 
  we have done this by rebuilding much trust between our governments . 
  die welt : how did you experience the surprising choice in your home country and the weeks since ? 
  emerson : like most i had expected a victory from hillary clinton . 
  and as you know , i worked in the office of her husband at the white house . 
  since it takes a while for an ambassador to be selected and confirmed in the senate , i assumed that i would be at least still in office during the g-20 summit in july . 
  we as a family have quite suddenly come into the situation to have to pack our things , to say goodbye to us within a few weeks . 
  i experience a lot of cordiality . 
  for us it is a bittersweet farewell . 
  but ( emerson changes to german , editor 's note ) -- wir haben noch einen koffer in berlin . 
  in charlottenburg we bought an apartment , so we can often come back . 
  die welt : thank you for calming us . 
  but how to defend the transatlantic partnership against a president who does not find it important ? 
  emerson : i think donald trump is on a steep learning curve . 
  he has already moved away from many spectacular announcements .
