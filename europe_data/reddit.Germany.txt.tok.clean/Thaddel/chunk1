so kind of like the [ deutsche arbeitsfront ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_labour_front ) ? 
  maybe we 'd have to find a new name though ... 
  probably somebody that claims to be non-communist , but actively works for communist goals . 
  why he would * ever * think that fits the freaking spd out of all parties is a mystery to me . 
  thinking like that would mean that the federal republic would have no responsibility concerning the crimes of the 3 ^ rd reich , as in paying reparations , for example . 
  and we both know that 's not the case . 
  i 'm not an expert , but i think that the federal republic is identical ( legally ) to the reich or something along those lines . 
  i think that depends on the culture as well , since turkish people usually do n't use mohammed as often , for example . 
  [ fortified democracy ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/streitbare_demokratie ) , mossafucka . 
  `` jude '' is used as an insult in german schools and not just by muslims . 
  or they just have port-a-potties ? 
  i was in [ sheenan 's ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/@53.3409128,-6.2618456,3a,75y,16.74h,72.94t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sfsa7t77ky7w3_xkjhe6xzq!2e0?hl=de ) with my friend two time and really liked it . 
  it 's not cheap and action-packed , but it has great food and beer and a laid-back atmosphere . 
  i think we had this discussion before and agreed to disagree , so i 'm not gon na start again . 
  do n't have to explain that to me . 
  sending any sort of military presense abroad is political suicide . 
  most people i 've spoken to want us to be a big switzerland . 
  people fall for this shit ? 
  not the same thing . 
  if you read about colonies under ss-supervision and with poles and other slavs being kept near-illiterate slaves , i ca n't help but think that that 's a worse fate than what happened to the poles under soviet rule . 
  am i saying that the soviets were n't bad ? 
  i 'm saying that , had the nazis succeeded , you can be sure as hell poland would not be where it 's at right now . 
  it is in german , i think . 
  let 's not forget that the soviet union , while responsible for many crimes against humanity , never had a plan to * physically wipe out tens of millions of people and to turn the survivors into literal slaves * , right ? 
  it 's a maymay that argentinians are all black that try claim to be white on the internet . 
  something like that . 
  the military-industrial complex is n't really a post-ww2 invention . 
  it can be argued it already existed in the german empire , for example . 
   and the reunification has been and still is considered an error by a sizeable group within germany what . 
  i know that * how * unification was handled is considered bad , but i really do n't know anyone that would claim that doing it was in itself bad . 
  do you have any sources for this ? 
  i am by no means saying it 's bad , i just happen to prefer aar in both melody and lyrics . 
  yup , iirc they also altered the later constitutions to omit any references to unification . 
  i really wish we 'd use that one instead of the lied der deutschen , i feel like it 's much more appropiate . 
  shame about it being defiled by the gdr regime . 
  you have to imagine him edgily leaning against a wall . 
  i mean , he 's a prussian republican !, 
  it least it 's not edgy like its [ republican prussian brother ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/coat_of_arms_of_prussia_%281918%e2%80%931933%29.svg/400px-coat_of_arms_of_prussia_%281918%e2%80%931933%29.svg.png ), 
  it 's good , but i like mine better . 
  i always liked [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/wappen_deutsches_reich_%28weimarer_republik%29.svg/480px-wappen_deutsches_reich_%28weimarer_republik%29.svg.png ) best, 
  a lithuanian pen pal once sent me a bit of tinginys and it was heaven !, 
  she also put in a bit of sakotis and i liked that as well . 
  well bismarck was kind of old and could not have stayed chancellor forever . 
  another interesting thought would be , what would have happened if friedrich iii . 
  would have survived . 
  he was said to have been fairly anglo-phile and even somewhat liberal ( for a prussian monarch ) . 
  definitely . 
  iirc , they wanted to continue a war against denmark which the prussian king denied and made peace , so there 's that . 
  to be honest though , i am not sure if it would have changed that much , since it 's still be the same militaristic elite that would gain power over germany . 
  the question would be if the constitution would be strong enough to constrain them . 
  i guess in a perfect world , they would have put the reactionaries in the military in politics out of power and put the army under strict parliamentary control , unlike in the empire . 
  one can dream ... 
  well they would have made one back then , if the king would 've said yes . 
  the few thinks i have heard about georg-friedrich , i have liked , iirc . 
  and giving unchecked powers to a single man * never * backfired , as we know . 
   i do n't see why they would not . 
  well , first of all good luck trying to build up some kind of absolutist monarchy nowadays , i 'm sure the rest of the austrian population will love your plan . 
  ( or would you just beat them into submisison like you would those unruly poles ? ), 
  and what happens if they do n't ? 
  ( which is what is going to happen ), 
  how do you think you 'll get the areas in the first place without violence , that 's what i meant to say . 
   if they resist , that is a rebellion . 
  so you want to force them to germanise with the threat of violence , yeah i can not see how that could possibly lead to problems with the outside world . 
  i 'm sure they 'll just sit by and watch you jail people ( or worse ) for not speaking the right language . 
   those areas have been german long before hitler came around . 
  and now they are not anymore . 
  the new borders have been unilaterally acknowledged and are uncontested , save for right-wing adventurers like yourself , who luckily are in the minority . 
  well that 's just so nice of you !, 
  how are you going to teach the poles german so that they will join gro\u00dfdeutschland without forcefully annexing the areas ? 
  do you actually think they 'll just be okay with being germanised after resisting every time it has been tried before ? 
  and you really think that the people there will just accept that ? 
  come on now . 
  cool , so he wants some old school ethnic cleansing in the areas not populated by germans or what ? 
  what a bunch of malarky . 
  which stolen lands are you referring to specifically ? 
  i did not say a single word about you being `` allowed '' anything . 
  just as you are allowed to spout your fedorable opinions , i am allowed to call them out . 
  / r/atheism is the other way, 
  i feared for my life at every street crossing anyway , haha . 
  even worse since ** nobody ** waits for the green light , even garda officers . 
  tell me about it . 
  it was very embarrassing to see that the station was right next to our hostel , since it was the last day for us where we could use it . 
  so we 'll have to wait until next time until we can , again . 
  bus drivers in dublin were absolutely insane . 
  when we took one to bray , it was speeding and jumping at bridges . 
  one of our guys got a little sick on the ride , the rest thought it was fun . 
  we still took the dart train back , though . 
  there was one instance of a person waving an israeli flag , as far as i know , he was swiftly ordered by police to roll it back in , which he did . 
  there was a jewish couple in berlin that was less lucky , a crowd apparently attacked them as the man was wearing a kippah . 
  ( they were said to not be part of any protest ), 
  people usually stand at red here . 
  when i was in dublin i even saw a police officer jawalking , i never felt so much like a johnny foreigner as when standing alone at the red light with everbody else walking . 
  [ fortified democracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) , motherfucker !, 
  because `` they '' , as in some random-ass tourists are n't the ones firing rockets . 
  also the whole `` eye for an eye '' shabang . 
  and how exactly do you prove that ? 
  what if it 's a leftist israeli on a visit ? 
  why the fuck should random israeli citizens be punished for actions of their government ? 
   in ukraine , a passenger plane from malaysia with 295 people on board has crashed , according to the russian news agency interfax . 
  the incident occurred near the russian border , citing the agency aviation circles .
