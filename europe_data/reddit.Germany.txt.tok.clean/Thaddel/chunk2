  still , their parents growing up under the gdr regime most likely has something to do with it . 
  if your parents are irreligious , you 're most likely going to grow up irreligious as well , i assume . 
   some countries have imposed restrictions such as requiring medical supervision . 
  the horror !, 
  or grandparents , friends , ect . 
  never spent a minute in any daycare centre . 
  i 'll be there in two days . 
  not the news i wanted to hear . 
  if it 's a piss that has been waiting to come out for a while , it 's a great feeling to put the left hand on the wall while letting out your sigh of relief . 
  i usually do it any time though . 
  same here . 
  also counts for football . 
  i do n't get america 's collective hatred for mayo on fried potato products , it 's heavenly . 
  i 've never heard anybody say that about australia ever . 
  * though then again , the only time i have ever heard people speak about australia was when they or people they knew were going on a holiday there . 
  * where i live . 
  was a bit different talking to an australia with chinese roots . 
  what . 
  i was saying that otto does n't really count as germany 's monarch . 
  i did n't say anything about whether or not i like him . 
  not really a ruling monarch . 
  i mean he was noble and chancellor , but does that really count , since the * ruling monarch * was wilhelm . 
  looking more into it you seem to be right , i 'll edit it to be sure . 
  the same song is actually also [ used in the bundeswehr !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ussftwt5emm ) they obviously switched out the ns-themes , however . 
  now it 's about paratroopers . 
  for example , instead of `` we fight for germany , we fight for hitler / the red will not get any rest '' , they sing `` we fight for germany , for freedom 's honour [ ? ], 
  / the enemy will not get any rest '' ** edit : may not actually be sung officially , take with caution !, 
  thank you / u/countvontroll !, 
   sounds like you 're one of those royalists though , and i 'll leave you in peace so you can do your looking up to . 
  i can sense the smug , self-satisfied grin from here . 
  since the republican form of government is enshrined in the constitution with the eternal-clause ( meaning it can not be changed by anyone , this also applies to the basic citizen 's rights , so that a nazi-style removal of these can not be repeated ) , we 'd have to draft up a new constitution and that would have to be approved in a referendum . 
  there 's monarchist groups , but they are virtually non-existent in public life , i do n't think there 's a pressing desire for the monarchy . 
  when we went to dublin for a week in 2012 we had sunshine and 20 \u00b0 c all week !, 
  i hope we 'll have the same luck in 2 weeks . 
  i 'm a bit torn on this . 
  while it 's true that there were german boys who were more or less forced to do it , we simply can not forget ( like reddit so often does ) that the wehrmacht was not `` just an army like all others '' . 
  plenty of those soldiers were deeply into the ns ideology , you can see that in their letters sent home , or in photos were they pose with signs saying `` the russian must die so we may live ! '' . 
  they were an essential and * willing * tool in the conquest and annihilation of tens of millions . 
  too often you see people propagating the old clean wehrmacht myth . 
  that 's wrong . 
  source : i 'm european and i do not hate americans . 
  it 's somehow not the case in the former gdr . 
  there , we got the lowest percentage of religious people in the country . 
  i experience a lot of the opposite . 
  though , to be fair , that 's usually on youtube and facebook comments and those are terrible anywhere . 
  they most likely had to act as if they were against it for public peace 's sake . 
  remember that merkel was totally cool with it until it was revealed they tapped her phone as well . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiping_rebellion#death_toll  with no reliable census at the time , estimates are necessarily based on projections , but the most widely cited sources put the total number of deaths during the 15 years of the rebellion at ** about 20 -- 30 million civilians and soldiers ** . 
  most of the deaths were attributed to plague and famine . 
  at the third battle of nanking in 1864 , more than 100,000 were killed in three days . 
  edit : i was * not * tying this to the op directly , but showing how such a destructive conflict is pretty much never talked about in our culture ( not that we could ever talk about * every * conflict anyway ) . 
  i do know that wwii did not happen in the 19 ^ th century . 
  i actually did not ask any question whatsoever , but sure . 
  you said they were seeking to employ `` nazi racial politics '' without any proof . 
  neredev gave examples of how that is not the case . 
  i do n't see them posting any `` excuses '' . 
  just tag the guy as germanophobe, 
  that stands for a nazi group that was recently banned , they do n't like it . 
  the constitutional court has the power to ban parties of they pose a valid thread to the constitutional order , like they have done with the communist party and the socialist reich party in the 50s . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country rank 15 . 
   switzerland is a federation , france is a republic . 
  just semantics , but how are those exclusive ? 
  i mean we 're both , for example . 
  really ? 
  i have never heard anything like that . 
  then again , i have never heard anything about them in general . 
  oh , i misread then , sorry . 
  how old are you ? 
  or do we not teach it in school anymore ? 
  that 's pretty overtly racist . 
  might wan na leave it in / pol / . 
  what, 
   not only this , but nobody in her government gave a fuck when blanket spying on germans was revealed . 
  only when she was revealed as a target did this become an issue . 
  it really baffled me how obvious she made this . 
  but they still considered themselves to be germans , hence why they were called `` deutsch\u00f6sterreich '' in the interwar period . 
  read the other posts itt . 
  by now the two built their separate identities and cultures and nationalism is n't what it used to be , so there 's no demand for it . 
  especially with the eu being a thing . 
   vote for die partei - it is very good !, 
   even if they do , things will not be significantly worse off for you unless you 're in a marginalized group gee , i guess i do n't have to care about it then . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  i 've never been there , but it 's worth pondering about going to smaller alternatives to the oktoberfest , if you want a more `` genuine '' and less tourist-y experience . 
  ( also most likely cheaper ) . 
  oh that depends on what you want to do . 
  if you want parties and nightlife , go to berlin . 
  if you want museums and history , go to berlin . 
  if you like industry and greyness , visit our [ ruhrgebiet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruhr ) . 
  you could also see cities like cologne and d\u00fcsseldorf ^ ^ ^ ^ best , ^ ^ ^ ^ beer ^ ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ ^ well which is nice . 
  if you want castles , you should check out the [ romantic rhine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8tsu7h1o2w ) . 
  or you like mountains , in which case bavaria ( or the south in general ) would be more appropriate . 
  to be honest schulz is also the only one of the candidates that you actually see on posters . 
  i have never seen juncker 's face yet , schulz is somewhat present in d\u00fcsseldorf and shows up here and there in krefeld . 
  you missed the part where i got killed if you did not let me crash at your place . 
  and in that case , at least in germany , that is `` unterlassene hilfeleistung '' which is will get you to court . 
  why did they use the state flag of prussia to represent all of germany ? 
  why not the nazi eagle or something ? 
  but if france would not have been invaded , the allies could have massed troops there and just step on german soil . 
  that 's hardly a situation where you can start an operation like barbarossa .
