  [ belgium never die ] ( http://abload.de/img/belgiumstrong3mroy.jpg ), 
   after all hitler was democratically elected . 
  he was put into office by the president , the nsdap never got over 50 % of the votes , even with jailing communists and threatening people with violence . 
  parties are outlawed if they meet certain criteria , including the will ** and the capability ** to violently overthrow the constitutional order . 
  accordingly the socialist reich party ( more or less direct successor to the nsdap ) and the communist party were banned in the 50s , for example . 
  nowadays the national democratic party is the biggest neo-nazi party , however , as you can see from the name , they try to hide their true intentions as much as they can in order not to get banned . 
  cracks in that facade are apparent though ( one of their leading men called germany a jew republic during a speech once , many of their members have a criminal background and ties to violent neo-nazi groups ) and so the highest court is looking into a ban again ( after declining before ) . 
  i think the russian keyboard does n't have the : so they 'd have to switch every time . 
  so we should deny people basic human rights because of their political or religious beliefs ? 
  only because somebody else does it too ? 
  what 's great about the bpb is that you can order magazines they make about historical or political issues for free ( only the postage is paid by you ) . 
  i have like 30 of those here . 
  they sometimes publish books for very cheap , like christopher clark 's book on wwi , they offered it for only 7 $ . 
  what i was getting at is that if they do n't have a 2nd passport , there is no country you can deport them to . 
  and , iirc , you can not strip a person off his only citizenship . 
  what if they 're born in france and only have the french passport ? 
  i guess if you put them into the same category with their neighbours it 'll lead to some problems . 
  have fun getting the populace behind that . 
  that day will always be connected to sufjan stevens ' song for me . 
  we have the philadelphiastra\u00dfe here , since the founders of germantown came from here . 
  why are people replying to a troll account ? 
  i guess that is true , yes . 
  do n't forget anti-semitic . 
  they may not openly admit it , but [ one of their leaders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udo_past%c3%b6rs ) was taped calling germany a `` judenrepublik '' before . 
  i mean , it is a neo-nazi party . 
  not in the sense of calling every nationalist party neo-nazi , but in the sense that they are national socialists and want to revive the 3rd reich in some way . 
   weak busy with post-modern bullshit . 
  such as ? 
  i think you 'd be hard pressed to find any german on the internet that does not dislike him , honestly . 
  the scenes with the english football fans were hilarious . 
  lighten up . 
  the only article like that that i have recently seen was saying that a former bundeswehr-general was pleading for conscription because the bundeswehr could not do its most important job of defending the country without it . 
  maybe they looked at your username and made assumtions . 
  possibly maybeeee ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ possibly ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ maaaybeeee, 
  well we would 've ended up as the primary battlefield during the cold war . 
  in germany we had similar things , especially the rigged bridges and landing strip-autobahn . 
  i guess this is a necessary release valve for the people . 
  if the protest would 've been cracked down you could expect them to grow extremely quickly . 
  look at his username , it 's a / pol / troll . 
  he looks cute and adorable you mean !, 
  [ could this man hurt a fly ? 
  it seems like ( nearly ) every single country says that about their rail system . 
  apparently not , or they would n't need such stringent moderation . 
  because not every one is that much of a pedant . 
  yea , iirc , * festungshaft * is reserved for honourful incarceration as opposed to the * zuchthaus * . 
  because the judge thought adolf was a swell dude , he got the best possible deal . 
  that 's a completely useless distinction anyway , as those were not the racial criteria used by the nazis . 
  yes , they favoured those attributes , but still any brown haired yokel in germany was valued higher than blond and blue-eyed slavs . 
   unless you were a jew or a non tall blue eyed blond , nazism was of no consequence . 
  you 're kind of forgetting the couple of slavic people that were in the way of the settlement of the east by germanic * herrenmenschen * . 
  somewhat related : the * new yorker * did [ a very in-depth article ] ( http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german ) about merkel 's rise to power and how she shaped german political life last year . 
  i highly recommend reading it if you 're interested . 
  1984 references are n't as clever as you think they are . 
  they 're actually really obvious and almost always heavy-handed and ridiculous . 
  i did n't mention diversity at all , thanks for showing your colours even clearer . 
  yeah bro , people get fired for saying they want children ( `` preserving your lineage '' ) all the time . 
  or was that just coded speak for something else ? 
  righly being told that you 're an asshole for having asshole beliefs is n't persecution . 
  boars , they 're wildschweine . 
  we definitely covered it in school and it 's also pretty much always covered in documentaries and historical magazines on the topic . 
  i can only speak from my personal experience of course . 
  but it is definitely not swept under the rug . 
  rather it 's viewed like our [ president said in 1985 ] ( http://www.lmz-bw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/medienbildung_mco/fileadmin/bibliothek/weizsaecker_speech_may85/weizsaecker_speech_may85.pdf ) , `` we must not separate 8 may 1945 from 30 january 1933 '' . 
  well i guess it can be seen as indicative of the population 's feelings and is n't there an upcoming parliamentary election soon ? 
  bnd ( afaik ) is extremely dependant on help by the us to function because it does n't have the capabilities to act on its own , likely the nsa asks for stuff inreturn for said help . 
  i 'm not a fan of `` history just repeats itself '' theories as they seem very deterministic and simplfy complex events a lot , but i guess i can sort of see your point . 
  would germany really be such a good example though , considering it did n't evolve into democracy on its own but by military defeat ? 
  true , the anglo ones are usually called air force . 
  french would be arm\u00e9e de l'air , perhaps ? 
  it 's just not as recognisable as air force tho, 
  are you sure about the second part ? 
  i 'm pretty certain that i 've heard other countries ' air forces referred to as , for example , franz\u00f6siche luftwaffe . 
  not sure what your point is . 
  the nazis only wanted to germanise ( read : kidnap away from their families ) a selected few poles . 
  the majority was to be murdered , the rest held as barely-literate slaves . 
  not sure how that 'd be preferable to the ussr . 
  seeing as the polish nation still exists after the soviet victory and seeing what the nazis had in store in case of their own victory , i 'm not quite sure how you can claim that they would have been preferable . 
  the difference being that the nazis planned to exterminate most of the polish nationa nd keep the rest as barely-literate slaves . 
  i fully understand why you would not celebrate the red army , but trying to paint the wehrmacht as more benevolent is ridiculous . 
  that 's true of course , but there 's quite a difference between [ this ] ( http://abload.de/img/luftwaffe4rujz.jpg ) peaked cap and [ this ] ( http://img.morgenpost.de/img/politik/crop100213802/3248728139-ci3x2l-w620/miliz-dw-politik-moskau.jpg ) one , do n't you think ? 
   putin has a big nose which is typical in racist charicatures . 
  or caricatures have a way of exagerrating facial features ? 
  like merkel 's smile , obama 's ears , ect . 
  if putin was jewish and they gave him a big , crooked nose i 'd agree but this is ridiculous . 
  while we of course should not blindly trust what he said , is it not true that the western allies could have made a huge difference by acting right in 1939 ? 
  that 's a good point , but broomsticks are not as emotional a topic as occupation and genocide . 
  you really think that if people openly mock german there would be no german posters getting angry ? 
  not really , there was plenty of continuity , especially in the brd . 
  people like [ hans globke ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/hans_globke ) , or many of the judges of the [ vgh ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/people%27s_court_\\ ( germany \\ ) ) who quickly found work in german courts . 
  or the [ organisation gehlen ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/gehlen_organization#/criticism ) , precursor to our intelligence agency . 
  well yeah , they let western europeans get by because they did n't plan to murder them and colonise their lands . 
  do you have any sources that the congressmen did n't read it and just voted on the name ? 
  [ it 's not new by any means , but it fits . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mftl2xxnuc ), 
  are you ... really implying it was n't ? 
  [ of course , here you go . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/2ujnjs/im_dennis_wise_the_creator_of_the_greatest_story/ ) good chance to rev up those res-tags , you 'll see them popping back up in / r/europe sometimes . 
  that 's far from the worst thing you 'll find there . 
  they had an ama with the maker of a `` hitler did nothing wrong '' kind of film a few months ago . 
  til everybody left of the nsdap is a marxist,
