  i do n't know , i just never got into the habit of paying with the card , before i signed up at paypal i basically only used it at atms to get my money or make payments because i was too lazy to deal with these tan-numbers for online-banking . 
  cash money feels nice , i like ordering the bills after value and putting away the small coins in a glass until i got enough to take to the bank and deposit . 
  :3 also , sometimes you get these special euro coins , like we have a 2 $ series where every year another state puts a recognisable building on the back , a few days ago i got [ this year 's model by hessen ] ( http://www.muenzen-news.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2_euro_deutschland_2015_hessen.jpg ) with the paulskirche , which i thought was neat because of its [ role ] ( http://www.wikiwand.com/en/frankfurt_parliament ) in the 1848 revolution ( i 'm reading a book about that right now ) . 
  i do n't know if there 's a point to all this . 
  i just like muh cash . 
  haha , for me it 's the other way around . 
  it feels natural to pay in cash and i like the feeling of the money , counting it and whatnot . 
  it 's always cool to looks at the euro coins and see where they came from , too . 
  well , there 's many people that do n't do that and primarily pay cash . 
  i 've only paid with my card once in my life , outside of online stuff . 
  i disagree . 
  1789 is usually painted pretty favourably , until you get to the whole killing everyone thing . 
  but especialyl its values are always pointed towards , in my experience . 
  1848 too , is considered one of the foundations of our republic and was discussed broadly in school , although i definitely agree that it does not get the attention it deserves . 
  maybe it depends on the country you live in , too . 
   i find it interesting that the current mood among european elites is to disassociate themselves from 1789 and 1848 . 
  where do you see this ? 
  i do n't see them mention those things all that much and if they do , i do n't see them paint them in a bad light , especially 1848 . 
  why would n't they have been ? 
  and which in particular are you thinking of ? 
  i think the german one had some great ambitions , but ultimately failed to really depose of the reactionaries and got stuck infighting . 
  while many unfortunately threw the good-will towards the polish nation out of the window after some time , i do n't think they would 've done a much worser job than the hohenzollern/bismarck team , from what i can tell . 
  well there 's actual stormfront/daily stormer screenshots where they talk about invading / r/europe , have n't seen a similar thread by leftists yet . 
  why would n't they be able to ? 
  completely normal here , at least . 
  nice job moving those goalposts . 
  first it was every criticism being punished and now it 's just actual hate speech . 
  people are replying to you on an internet forum . 
  * literally * intimidation . 
  people like you have the thinnest fucking skins in the world , dude . 
  not sure why you picked that example , since it 's perfectly legal to display it in the us . 
  it 's controversial in many areas , but that 's about it and really not comparable to the german approach . 
  it 's on / r/all virtually every month or so . 
  when i took russian history once , i learned that there 's a proposed term to clarify whether or not you are talking about an ethnic russian ( russisch ) or a russian citizen ( russl\u00e4ndisch ) , akin to what you guys do . 
  but apparently it has n't really caught on . 
  apparently you have to be a leftist to think that dictatorship = bad , lol . 
  no , it 's a [ real strain of the far-left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-germans_\\ ( political_current \\ ) ) . 
  they have a large focus on anti-semitism . 
  why should state symbols enjoy such legal protection ? 
  i think the other guy was correct , he just used a colloquial phrasing . 
   you have a very deep trust and unquestionable loyalty to your government . 
  i 've just seen with mine own eyes the evidence that pointed to him being a right-winger . 
   do you believe that the cologne rapes was a hoax to make your government look bad ? 
   according to nazi race theory , aryans ( like him ) were originally from persia . 
  ah , but you see , they actually came up with a [ wacky theory ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mdcw03m.jpg ) to address the issue of germanics not really being the hottest shit in antiquity . 
  [ they just declared that all the great civilizations profited from germanic migrants who were the ones * actually * responsible for all the achievements . 
  lol so you take unsourced witness reports over actual evidence because it fits into your worldview better . 
  feels  reals , amirite trumpets ? 
  i can imagine !, 
  i only know that great bundesheer ad with the tank and the russian vdv song . 
  the only thing i do n't like about their channel is that often the videos have such ridiculous music , like the cheapest `` omg so badass '' kinda stuff . 
  then again , i do n't know what kind of music they * should * put there to make it work . 
  more fluent translation : upon arrival , the officers caught the suspect during the act . 
  , according to the police report . 
  the suspect is reported to be a 40-year-old accepted refugee who has lived in germany since 2013 . 
  he was brought before a judge on sunday who issued an arrest warrant . 
  the woman was able to leave the hospital on tuesday . 
   munich -- bavaria 's top security official says germany needs to be able to call upon its military in times of crisis like friday night 's shooting rampage at a munich mall . 
   with an eye on the nazi era excesses , germany 's post-war constitution only allows the bundeswehr to be deployed domestically in a national emergency . 
   but state interior minister joachim herrmann told welt am sonntag newspaper sunday the regulations are obsolete , with `` an absolutely stable democracy in our country . '', 
   `` in extreme situations -- like for example the terrorist attacks in paris and brussels -- we should also be able to call upon the bundeswehr in germany , '' he said . 
  `` it makes no sense to say we categorically reject that . '', 
   an 18-year-old with a pistol killed nine and wounded dozens friday before taking his own life . 
  what ? 
  he 's referring to military unit 's * he 's trained with * . 
  where did he even mention the ksk ? 
  shows that torture is not permissible in any case ( art . 
  1 gg ) so no , it would not be `` 100 % professional to start beating the shit out of the guy until he says where his friends are that helped him . '', 
  the point of the article is that we do n't know whether or not he was mistreated by the police , dude . 
  you 're right !, 
  some small boulders against vehicles that do n't impede anyone else are * literally * like nuclear bunkers . 
  to be pedantic , it asks whether you support the party list ( for the reichstag ) of `` our leader adolf hitler '' , not him personally . 
   two correspondents of swiss tv were falsely taken for germans and , according to their statements , harrassed by turkish police because of it . 
  the turkey-correspondent of the srf , ruth bossart , told news agency dpa on tursday , police officers at the airport in diyarbakir had searched the two teams `` right through to the dirty laundry '' in their baggage . 
   during that , they had expressedly referred to the delayed return of high-ranking turkish mps from germany . 
  president erdogan had said about that , on wednesday , that turkey would `` reply in kind '' to that . 
   bossart said she was asked during a security screening at the diyarbakir airport , if she spoke german . 
  after confirming this , policemen had taken the camera teams to the side on command of an `` aggressive chief '' and searched them for 45 minutes . 
  `` we had to unpack everything . '', 
  they were told something like , `` if your country does this kind of thing to our citizens , we 'll do it to yours as well . '', 
   `` we tried to show them that we 're swiss and turkish people but they were n't interested , '' said bossart . 
  the turkish team members were told that they would not be treated as turks when working for foreigners . 
  bossart commented , `` that 's obviously harrassment [ schikane ] . '', 
  only during the second screening a supervisor apparently told the policemen , `` that switzerland is not germany . '', 
   ### special treatment of german diplomats  after delay of the return flight of a turkish mp from germany , turkey had reportedly made more difficult the entry for german diplomats . 
  news agency dha reported thursday that , since the previous day , there was a governmental order whereafter germans with a diplomatic pass were to be questioned at controls at the istanbul atat\u00fcrk-airport . 
  only after being questioned for an hour at the country 's biggest airport would they be allowed into the country . 
   turkish vice-parlamentary president ayse nur bahcekapili from the ruling akp had been temporarely stopped at the airport cologne-bonn at the beginning of the month because of missing papers . 
  president erdogan had then threatened on wednesday , turkey would `` respond in kind '' to this german conduct . 
  [ the chancellor has no say over the judges . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_constitutional_court#appointment_of_judges ) but you are right in respect to her trying to appeal to the more conservative voters , independant of that . 
  surely you 'll agree that legalised murder and an extra piece of clothing carry somewhat different effects on society at large , right ? 
  according to what i 've read so far , they 'll go for : ** preparation of a serious violent offence endangering the state ** , [ \u00a7 89a stgb ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0903 )  ( 1 ) whosoever prepares a serious offence endangering the state shall be liable to imprisonment from six months to ten years . 
  a serious violent offence endangering the state shall mean an offence against life under sections 211 or 212 or against personal freedom under sections 239a or 239b , which under the circumstances is intended to impair and capable of impairing the existence or security of a state or of an international organisation , or to abolish , rob of legal effect or undermine constitutional principles of the federal republic of germany . 
   ( 2 ) subsection ( 1 ) above shall only be applicable if the offender prepares a serious violent offence endangering the state by  1 . instructing another person or receiving instruction in the production or the use of firearms , explosives , explosive or incendiary devices , nuclear fission material or other radioactive substances , substances that contain or can generate poison , other substances detrimental to health , special facilities necessary for the commission of the offence or other skills that can be of use for the commission of an offence under subsection ( 1 ) above ,  2 . producing , obtaining for himself or another , storing or supplying to another weapons , substances or devices and facilities mentioned under no . 
  1 above ,  3 . obtaining or storing objects or substances essential for the production of weapons , substances or devices and facilities mentioned under no . 
  ( 1 ) above , or  4 . collecting , accepting or providing not unsubstantial assets for the purpose of its commission . 
   [ ... ]  ( 7 ) the court in its discretion may mitigate the sentence ( section 49 ( 2 ) ) or order a discharge for the offence under this provision , if the offender voluntarily gives up the further preparation of the serious violent offence endangering the state , or averts or substantially reduces a danger caused and recognised by him that others will further prepare or commit the offence , or if he voluntarily prevents the completion of the offence . 
  if the danger is averted or substantially reduced regardless of the contribution of the offender or the completion of the serious violent offence endangering the state prevented , his voluntary and earnest efforts to achieve that object shall suffice .
