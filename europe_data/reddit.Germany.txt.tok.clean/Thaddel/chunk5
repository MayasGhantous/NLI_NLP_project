  truly the pinnacle of political discourse . 
  berlin ca n't even build [ an airport ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_brandenburg_airport ) mate , let 's not set our expectations too high . 
  thing is that he always was this kind of tinfoil-hat nutjob , even before the attack . 
  it 's not just the trauma . 
  yeah man , i also always call the cops on the local kids chalking up the sidewalk . 
  fucking criminals , amirite ? 
  almost , and hear me out on this , * almost * like parade floats are n't meant as water-tight political manifestos !, 
   people insulting and wishing suffering on others for their sexualiy = minority groups asserting their rights to self-expression ok, 
  yes , we are all secretely still 1933 % nazi , you got us !, 
  march '33 already saw massive repressions by the state and sa forces , it 's definitely stretching the term `` free elections '' . 
  thank you for your perspective !, 
  just out of interest : are there any issues with immigrants and their decendants learning the language ? 
  i imagine icelandic * would n't be that easy . 
  we 'll see in a few hours . 
  police spokesman just said it was a kitchen knife . 
  if it came off like that , i 'm sorry . 
  that 's obviously not what i meant . 
  i interpreted it in a more `` benevolent '' manner - `` many '' can mean any number , really . 
  but yeah , i probably should have noticed his agenda earlier .

  the webadress of this site is https://hh.hinweisportal.de . 
  that 's just ridiculous . 
  sure , but that does n't change the fact that germany started the war in order to exterminate them . 
  i do agree that the slavic victims of wwii tend to get underrepresented . 
  especially when you remember that genocide/enslavement of them * was the entire point * of the war . 
  still , considering the timing and person , it really just seems like a cheap way to rile up the base . 
  --  police officers have preliminarily arrested a not-yet-identified man who is suspected of having injured multiple people with a knife . 
   according to present knowledge the suspect , who has since been preliminarily arrested , entered a super market and abruptly started stabbing customers there . 
   witnesses chased him and called the police . 
  the officers , who arrived shortly after , preliminarily arrested the suspect on a street in the vicinity of the crime scene . 
   by now it 's known that multiple people have been injured through stab wounds , one of the victims has died from his wounds . 
   the press speaker is at the scene and ready to make statements . 
   there will be further info . 
  the case is of an algerian man who has been deemed a * gef\u00e4hrder * by the authorities . 
  that is a term with no real translation , it means that he is considered a danger to public safety but no actual crime can be proven that would bring him behind bars/in deportation custody . 
  the authorities ordered his deportation ( and unlimited ban on re-entry ) in march 2017 on basis of [ \u00a7 58a residency act ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/englisch_aufenthg.html#p0868 ) :  ( 1 ) the supreme land authority may issue a deportation order for a foreigner without a prior expulsion order based on the assessment of facts , in order to avert a special danger to the security of the federal republic of germany or a terrorist threat . 
  the deportation order shall be immediately enforceable ; no notice of intention to deport shall be necessary . 
   ( 2 ) the federal ministry of the interior may assume responsibility if a special interest on the part of the federation applies . 
  the supreme land authority is to be notified accordingly . 
  deportation orders issued by the federation shall be enforced by the federal police . 
   ( 3 ) a deportation order may not be enforced if the conditions pertaining to a deportation ban pursuant to section 60 ( 1 ) to ( 8 ) apply . 
  section 59 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) shall apply mutatis mutandis . 
  assessment in this context shall be carried out by the authority deciding on the deportation order ; this authority shall not be bound to findings reached in this connection in other proceedings . 
   ( 4 ) following announcement of the deportation order , the foreigner is to be given an opportunity to establish contact with a legal adviser of his or her choice without delay , unless he or she has secured the services of a lawyer beforehand ; the foreigner is to be informed of this entitlement , of the legal consequences of the deportation order and the available legal remedies . 
  an application for temporary relief pursuant to the code of administrative courts procedure shall be filed within seven days of announcement of the deportation order . 
  deportation may not be enforced until expiry of the period in accordance with sentence 2 and , if an application for temporary relief is filed in time , until the time of the court 's decision on said application . 
  what 's important here is that the deported-to country must guarantee the deported 's basic rights - i.e. 
  he can not be deported if he faced torture or the death penalty at home . 
  -- major points : * there was a formal complaint about how the law was passed , but i think it 'd be too complicated and in-depth to really explain here . 
  what 's important is that the court did n't see it as violating the constitutional order . 
  * the court also held that the law itself is compatible with the constitution . 
  the law concerning itself with `` special threats to the federal republic of germany , i.e. 
  a terrorist threat '' is considered determinable enough to not be too broad . 
  especially because the federal administrative court had already clarified the law 's boundaries in its ruling of the case . 
  * additionally , the court argued that the algerian man was not only deported for his religious or political views , but concrete indicators of his being a threat : he glorified the is , defended the attack on * charlie hebdo * , and made death threats against a jewish woman and a french official in 2015 . 
  he was therefore not violated in his basic rights . 
  * lastly , the algerian authorities made credible assertions that his rights would not be violated on returning to the country which removes the final hurdle . 
  * the decision is final and can not be appealed . 
  -- is is an important decision because previous to his case in march , it was considered unclear whether a deportation on grounds of being labeled * gef\u00e4hrder * would stand in court , as it is not an actual legally defined term and the person in question would not have commited a crime , strictly speaking . 
  you caught us , there were nazis all over the government in the early republic . 
  what 's the relation today ? 
  is there evidence of that conspiracy being successful , up until today ? 
   pledge loyalty to europe or suffer punishment . 
  sometimes you should take a step back , re-read what you typed and ask `` does this make me sound like a comic book villain ? '', 
  if you wan na get freaky with it , you can point towards various german ( proto - ) nazi thinkers arguing that [ all important empires ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7oo9qjc.jpg ) were only possible thanks to nordic blood-heritage [ brought into the world through immigration ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p5htufg.jpg ) ( apparently it needed the right climate to blood , hence the lack of greatness at home ) . 
  i guess the question is how deeply versed in that sorta stuff the guy was . 
  it 's also bullshit because the flag is everywhere .
