  or am i the only one that sees like 20 of them in every * [ schrebergarten ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/kleingaerten.jpg ) * ? 
  i mean what is the sufficent amount of flags per house ? 
  the autobahnen were already planned before the nazis , they simply pulled the plans out of the drawers . 
  considering how much of the german scientific community left the country because of hitler i 'm not sure i agree that he had such a huge positive impact on it . 
  to the contrary , really . 
  which industries became `` best in the world '' without being directly tied to his warmongering efforts ? 
  what can today 's leaders learn from the holiday organisation that could n't be learned form other sources ? 
  how many of those will we enounter on reddit ? 
  which type of ethno-nationalism is most relevant for a european , do you think ? 
  she made a video about `` white genocide '' , albeit with a bit of rebranding . 
  ( where she conveniently counted all immigrants as black or brown and does n't even mention how many are inter-eu because that would go against her narrative ) i do n't care if you agree with it or not , but denying that it is firmly on the far-right spectrum is ridiculous . 
  not really mate . 
  what are the great things that hitler did , specifically ? 
  what can we learn from him ? 
  sure , but there 's a reason right-wing reactionaries and nazis and folks like that referred to bavaria as the * ordnungszelle * . 
  it was more welcoming to the extreme right than other states . 
  the catholic parties managing to keep their voting blocs does n't tell the whole story . 
   ** in the west ** . 
  insulting someone is only illegal if you discriminate someone in certain ways . 
  you ca n't be racist , sexist or insult based on religion . 
  depends on the country we 're talking about , `` personal honour '' is a constitutionally protected legal interest in germany , for example . 
  it 's literally listed as an exception to free speech in the constitution . 
  simply insulting somebody * is * a crime in and of itself , however it is only prosecuted if the insulted party presses for it . 
  and it 's often dropped because of its minor nature . 
  it 's different for people like law enforcement officers though , they can and will press charges and people do get sentenced . 
  the difference to turkey is that it 's pretty unheard of to get heavier than a fine . 
  [ an example that randomly came to my mind ] ( http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/64017/3606112 ) , earlier this year an american tourist was unhappy with the speed with which her papers were checked by federal police and how eu citizens were going through so much faster in their lane . 
  when everything was done , she said farewell to the officer with a `` you piece of shit '' , which was n't appreciated . 
  she was fined a total sum of 1.200 $ plus court costs . 
  yes, 
  so doing it would not have made ww2 go different course , as per your own comment . 
  but it would also have saved lithuania form soviet occupation ? 
  so why shoud lithuania join the axis if it would n't have changed anything ? 
  those big lions look kinda unsure of themselves, 
  dude no , the * entire reason * why the nazis were bent on war in the east was extermination and enslavement of the slavic peoples and subsequent german colonialism . 
  that 's the god damn * point * of the whole thing . 
  enjoy your generalplan ost , then . 
  putting flags near a user 's nickname somehow tends to turn them into official ambassadors in the eyes of other users . 
  yep , this is the [ painting that hung in the first german parliament ] ( http://www.vulture-bookz.de/imagebank/dokumente/images/1848~paulskirchenparlament.jpg ) in st. paul 's church . 
  yes , but you generally need to use the least harmful means at your disposal that 'll reliably end the attack . 
  especially if you are armed and the attacker is n't , you generally need to first threaten the attacker before using it ( not if that threat would put you in danger ) and/or use it in non-lethal ways ( warning shots ) . 
  i 'm not a lawyer , but i think you 'd have a hard time convincing a court that it was appropiate for you to shoot somebody for damaging your car . 
  while you do n't need to weigh the legal goods ( here : your property vs. the attacker 's life ) in every case of self-defense , if they are `` obviously disproportionate '' your right to self-defense can be limited . 
  ( [ used arguments from this judgement ] ( http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?gericht=bgh&amp;art=en&amp;sid=4d0f11a33705989c23b2e9bada749005&amp;nr=74902&amp;pos=1&amp;anz=2 ) ), 
  one of their lawyers today said that he does understand it but not that they did it in their own backyard ... 
  so the world should have accepted nazi germany 's expansion in order to not `` sink to their lows '' ? 
  did they `` win '' because other nations killed and destroyed them ? 
  you could n't act more like a self-righteous german stereotype if you tried . 
  hamburg is known for its left-wing extremist scene anyway , i 'm sure they brought in a bunch of their friends from all over europe as well . 
  by the way , [ they brought in a swat team ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dekzt2qxyaa73nb.jpg ) now which appears to be searching some houses . 
  almost like there 's some sort of special thing about hamburg this weekend . 
  man i wish op would have included that in his title !, 
  unconstitutional , anybody ordering that would lose their job . 
  it also means that she only needs to do her job to be in the news 24/7 , meanwhile any competitor has to first get into the news cycle and stay there to be relevant . 
  hey genius , the spd are n't actually socialists . 
  even the conservatives are n't calling the spd tax plans socialist . 
  in germany it 's also just a 2/3 majority in both houses of parliament . 
  i tend to think that that 's too little , because grand coalitions including both biggest parties can often reach that goal by themselves . 
  at least we do have special protections for the most [ vital articles which can not be changed by anybody , no matter how big the majority . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternity_clause#germany ) you 'd have to draft an entirely new constitution and pass it through referendum , but that 's a bit much in most cases . 
  we do like our basic law . 
  so brave, 
  as the name `` federal service flag '' suggests , it 's supposed to show that whoever is flying it is a federal authority . 
  so * in theory * a random person flying it is making a false statement . 
  of course , nobody actually cares if you fly that flag on your property as long as you do n't actively pretend to be a federal authority . 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  haha , i meant it as they * removed * the cool shit and made it bigger . 
  :d but it 's taste anyway . 
  yeah , i really do n't get what people see in nazi architecture outside of `` woah so big '' . 
  they took all the cool shit out of classicism and blew it up to ridiculous proportions . 
  great . 
  do know what what the flag with the crown is in the bundesrat-picture ? 
  i think i 'd prefer just the coa on the wall , but it looks nice in general !, 
  i 'd love it if the rest of the world could just bury this meme . 
  phew , at least we found a way to turn this issue into how much of a poor victim poland is . 
  what 's with ancaps and going from 0-100 like this ? 
  seriously , in one post you go from paying a bit more taxes to * genocide * . 
  good god , man . 
  she did and does get criticised by people on the left for her style , dude . 
  because right-wing judges were exceptionally lenient and right-wing politicians kept lifting bans on nazi organisations like the sa . 
  hitler should have been deported in 1923 per \u00a7 9 ii * republikschutzgesetz * but the conservative bavarian government struck a deal to have him tried in bavaria ( and not the * staatsgerichtshof * in leipzig as he should have been ) where they ignored the law and gave him a ridiculously light sentence . 
  it was n't too much resistance , it was that any meaningful resistance was actively sabotaged by the conservatives . 
  yes , but this * [ beschlussempfehlung ] ( http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/130/1813013.pdf ) * lists the changes which are n't in your link . 
  if you check the bundestag page again , they also reference the * beschlussempfehlung * 18 / 13013 there . 
  at least that 's how i understand it !, 
  [ hey mate , the bill you posted was actually changed on the 28th , here 's a german article about it . 
  i disagree , it sets a bad precedent . 
  can you give us an overview of the no doubt many media sources you 've read that call this a good thing ? 
  but this is the exact kind of shit people have been ( rightly ) criticising trump for . 
  leading politicians should n't hide from the press and only talk through photo-ops and campaign rallies . 
  q&a sessions with the press are important . 
  the evil agenda of pointing out the flaws in politicians ' reasonings !, 
  translated it . 
  if it reads awkwardly , it 's both me being tired and the original text being badly written . 
   during an event hosted by the * brigitte * magazine on monday evening in berlin , merkel said that she would like a discussion that 's `` more along the lines of a decision of conscience '' . 
  in the case of a bundestag vote without a party whip , a majority for same-sex marriage is seen as a secure thing . 
  according to dpa information , merkel talked with csu-chief horst seehofer about the issue . 
  [ more conservative bavarian sister party ]  the social democrats , greens and free democrats had made complete marriage equality a condition for coalitions . 
  the left party also demands gay marriage . 
  merkel said she had naturally noted how all parties except the union stood on this topic and the right-wing populist alternative for germany would not be considered as a coalition partner .
