   she said she was `` troubled '' that this very personal issue is a thing of `` party conventions and bold things [ * plakative dinge * , not sure how to translate ] .

  she called for respect for people that struggled with the question out of religious motivations . 
   she wants discussions `` more along the lines of a decision of conscience '' and not to `` whip '' majorities . 
  same-sex pairs have the same values , according to her . 
   however , she finds it odd that the spd had not talked about it in 4 years of coalition and that now it 's supposed to go `` chop-chop . '', 
   merkel , who had rejected same-sex adoptions last election because of the children 's well-being told of a `` deciding experience '' in her district . 
  she had been invited home by a lesbian woman , for a visit to her and her partner and to see that her 8 foster children were doing fine . 
   merkel said that if youth services could entrust eight children to a lesbian pair , the state could n't argue against adoptions on grounds of the children 's well-being . 
  it 's not a high-ranking topic for most , so the conservatives got away with endlessly dragging their feet ( to appease their base ? ) . 
  but now that multiple parties made it a condition for coalitions , they had to act . 
  thank god for the constitutional court .

  * the social democrats published their ** tax reform plans ** which are supposed to ease the burden by 15 billion euros , mostly for lower and middle income people . 
  while the liberals and the conservatives criticise it for going too far against the `` top performers '' ( * leistungstr\u00e4ger * ) of society , more left-wing parties say that it does n't go far enough . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/spd-steuerkonzept-entlastungen-fuer-kleine-und-mittlere.1939.de.html?drn:news_id=758832 ) ) * a special hearing in the bundestag showed near-uninimous criticism and rejection of the planned ** network enforcement act ** ( netzdg ) , which would force social media companies to delete `` illegal '' content . 
  the biggest criticism is that it 's the job of the courts to enforce the law , not private companies . 
  also that the possible fines for not complying could motivate companies to act in `` pre-emptive obedience '' and delete things that are n't illegal . 
  many have gone so far as to call it unconstitutional , especially endangering the freedom of opinion and speech . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/heiko-maas-facebook-gesetz-muss-schrumpfen-a-1152991.html ) ) * the federal constitutional court rejected an urgent motion by the green party to force a bundestag vote on the ** legalisation of gay marriage ** . 
  the conservatives have been accused of dragging their feet and artificially delaying the issue . 
  the court argued that there was no duty for parliament to vote on every bill before the end of a legislative period and that parliament ( or its respective organs ) is free to choose when to vote on what bill . 
  ( [ court press release ] ( http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/shareddocs/pressemitteilungen/de/2017/bvg17-046.html ) ) * the bundestag voted in favour of allowing law enforcement to use '' ** state trojans ** '' to infect suspect 's digital devices in order to gather evidence , to the heavy criticism of civil rights groups who signaled to move before the constitutional court in the future . 
  before , the practice was only allowed to the federal crime office in cases of major terrorism . 
  it is feared that wide-spread use of such practices not only violates people 's civil rights but will also weaken digital security , as law enforcement now has an incentive to not disclose key weaknesses in devices ' security .

  following the failure of the very democratic weimar system , the new republic was set up in a much more representative way . 
  this included the doing away with referenda and direct presidential elections , for example . 
  there have been multiple attempts to introduce referenda into the political system but they all failed due to the resistance of the conservatives ( confusingly , the social democrats were apprently sometimes for it and sometimes against it ) things vary in the different states .

  apparently the guy took a male officer 's gun , not the woman 's . 
  four people have been gravely wounded , one policewoman is in mortal danger . 
  according to current information , this is what happened : there was a normal police deployment in the station at first , following which a shooting broke out . 
   the police had received an emergency call at 8:20 o'clock from the s8 train , according to which `` an assault among passengers occured . '', 
  a police patrol that was called to the station then met the parties of that incident . 
   this is where the confrontation escalated . 
  the culprit , according to officers , is said to have tried to shove the police officers onto the tracks of an incoming train . 
  following that , the officers tried to subdue him . 
  in the ensuing scuffle , the suspect had managed to steal an officer 's firearm with which he then fired multiple shots on the officers . 
   according to current investigation information , a 26-year-old policewoman was injured in the head , she is in mortal danger . 
  two other , unconnected passangers were also gravely wounded . 
  the police shot the 37-year-old and heavily wounded him . 
   the police currently sees him as a single perpetrator that acted `` out of personal motives . '', 
  they rule out any terrorist background . 
  the passengers of the train are currently being psychologically looked after and questioned by the police . 
  experts are also evaluating cctv footage . 
   300 leos are active in unterf\u00f6hring , including a federal police helicopter and a swat commando . 
  [ local traffic info ] -- [ statement by munich police spokesman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yivbctytrl4 ) , marcus da gloria martins :  [ starts withc him describing the suspect shoving the officers in front of the train ] . 
  following that , he was brought to the ground . 
  during that scuffle , this person had apparently managed to get ahold of the firearm of the [ male ] colleague . 
  the person then fired multiple shots and gravely wounded the [ female ] patrol partner . 
  she 's still in a serious condition , in a munich hospital . 
  during the course of the incident , we did manage to impact the culprit through use of our firearms : meaning in short , we shot him . 
  hit him . 
  incapacitated him . 
  he is also heavily injured , but not mortally so . 
  he is currently in police custody . 
  during the shootout , presumably by the cuplrit - that 's what we have to look at carefully now - , two other uninvolved persons were injured as well . 
  medically speaking they were heavily injured , but not life-threatingly so . 
  they are also being treated in munich hospitals . 
  what you see behind me now is us trying to meticulously and properly investigate the matter , so that we can inform you what exactly happened . 
   [ cut ]  it is indeed the case that we are talking about a male single culprit that has acted out of a personal motivation . 
  according to our investigation we do not have a political , religious , or otherwise alarming [ to third parties ] background .
