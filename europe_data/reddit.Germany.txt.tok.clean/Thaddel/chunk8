  [ translation of a different german paper 's article , because * bild * is garbage ] ( http://www.ksta.de/panorama/mallorca-nazis-randalieren-im-bierkoenig---party-gaeste-reagieren-laessig-27776746 ) :  ruckus instead of party mood : just as the show of the former porn actress mia julia in the * bierk\u00f6nig * was in full swing , 15 neo-nazis stormed into the club and unfurled an imperial war banner . 
  they also yelled right-wing slogans and `` foreigners out ! '', 
   because of this ruckus , the show had to be put on hold for 20 minutes . 
  the guests however , were n't intimidated by the nazis . 
  to the contrary : encouraged by the singer , the guests started a loud `` nazis out ! '', 
  chorus . 
   the security personnel ended up throwing the nazis out of the cult bar , accompanied by the guests singing '' * auf wiedersehen !, 
  * '' and the dj played die \u00c4rzte 's anti-nazi song , * [ schrei nach liebe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x9cei8wkbc ) * . 
  the facebook video above captured the nazi incursion on the ballermann . 
   the singer commented on her facebook : `` the world is bad enough as is ... hatred , violence , and pain are not welcome at our parties ! '', 
   according to * bild * , the persons in question belong to so-called [ hammerskins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hammerskins ) from the palatinate , as well as hooligans from frankfurt that were said to have been part of right-wing demonstrations . 
   according to * mallorcazeitung * , it 's not the first instance of right-wingers creating furor on the ballermann . 
  for example in 2013 , a group of right-wing skinheads attacked coloured street vendors in playa de palma , injuring them . 
   even if their heart is in the right place , just look at germany in 1933 . 
  #  their heart is in the right place  germany in 1933 edit : or do you mean hindenburg ? 
  in that case sorry for meming you . 
  ( although he arguably also did n't have his heart in the right place ), 
  ** edit : i missed that you wrote `` active '' , sorry .

  [ there was also the foiled terror plot of franco a. 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a4o8c/another_german_soldier_arrested_on_terror_charges/dhbo3u7/ ) and two others , who 'd planned to murder high-profile politicans associated with the migrant crisis . 
  that said , whether they 're more active or dangerous than islamist terrorists , i do n't know . 
  it 's not really a contest , in any case . 
  i think that 's more relevant on an organised scale though . 
  if it 's whole mobs , or worse , governments doing it . 
  if it 's just some rando though , i 'm not seeing the immenant danger to public peace . 
  #thirty years ' war never forget  the * schwedentrunk * ( german : [ \u02c8\u0283ve\u02d0dn\u0329\u02cct\u0281\u028a\u014bk ] , swedish drink ) is a method of torture and execution in which the victim is forced to swallow large amounts of foul liquid . 
  the name was invented by german victims of swedish troops during the thirty years ' war . 
  this method of torture was administered by other international troops , mercenaries , and marauders , and especially by civilians following the swedish baggage train , who received no pay . 
  it was used to force peasants or town citizens to hand over hidden money , food , animals , etc. , or to extort sex from women . 
  they had a video of the incident . 
  i hate that rag too , but i doubt they recorded that shit in a studio . 
  yeah , that 's the thing . 
  all this surveillance shit does n't even work if no officers on the ground are there to act on the intel . 
  so many times the past attackers were well-known to the authorities . 
  it makes these calls for * even more * surveillance so transparently misleading . 
   according to a recent harvard kennedy school study of global media , 98 percent of german public television news portrays president donald trump negatively , making it by far the most anti-trump media in the world . 
  nice , already starting off with a lie . 
  that study not only took * neutral * reporting out of the data , it also rated factual reporting on failures of the trump administration ( like the travel bans ) as negative coverage . 
  it also was n't all `` german public television '' , but one main news show ( * tagesthemen * ) on one channel . 
  [ juncker also had something to say . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/zdfheute/status/870211190017929218 ) german transcript :  ich bin ein transatlantiker . 
  whatever that means , it means nothing , but it means everything . 
  translation :  i am a transatlanticist . 
  whatever that means , it means nothing , but it means everything . 
  but i am against us acting like we 're vassals of the americans . 
  if the american president said in the next hours or days that he was leaving the paris accord , then it is europe 's duty to say : that 's not how it works . 
  [ ... ] it does n't . 
  the americans really ca n't just exit this climate accord . 
  that 's what mr. trump thinks because he has n't come near enough to the dossiers to fully understand them . 
  it takes three , four years since it came into effect in november 2016 to exit . 
  so this imagening : `` i 'm trump , i 'm american . 
  america first and i 'll just vanish from the stage . '', 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  we tried , in clear german main sentences , also to trump , to explain that in taormina [ * laughter in the crowd * ] as it seems , this attempt has failed - but law is law . 
  or he would 've been relegated to a different position . 
  do you have any evidence of what you 're saying happening ? 
  why is this the new trend on reddit ? 
  why is it apparently * impossible * for people to be wrong about something now ? 
  why is it automatically * their narrative , maaaaan * ? 
  shoes inside the house ? 
  are you insane ? 
  the reichstag did exist under hitler , becoming the gro\u00dfdeutsche reichstag in 1938 . 
  obviously it had no legislative role , but it still convened from time to time . 
  for example , hitler openly threatened an `` eradication of the jewish race in europe '' , should a new war break out , during a reichstag speech . 
  that was on 30th january 1939 . 
  black text on black flag ... 
  yeah , there 's big problems with understaffed and underfunded police in germany as well . 
  only recently have politicans started to pledge to reverse the trend . 
  if you 're a fucking pre-schooler , yeah, 
  wow , you mean words can have various meanings depending on context ? 
  that 's crazy talk !, 
  the spd is traditionally more sceptical of the military . 
  they already criticise the 2 % defense spending goal ( arguing that germany should focus on economic and development aid to secure peace int he world ) and they tend to favour a less tough stance on russia , probably also because of the legacy of willy brandt 's * [ neue ostpolitik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willy_brandt#foreign_policy ) * and change through rapprochement ( * wandel durch ann\u00e4herung * ), 
  good points all, 
  interesting how the people that want to protect our allies in eastern europe from russian aggression are the warmongers and not , you know , * the actual russian invaders * . 
  you 're not just throwing them under the bus , you 're insulting them for daring to defend themselves . 
  quite rich , that . 
  why should russia reform if we simply reward them for their aggression by giving in to their demands ? 
   * some people in germany dont feel it ftfy, 
  [ full study by pew ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/05/23/natos-image-improves-on-both-sides-of-atlantic/ ) -- i think in germany it 's a mixture of things . 
  for one , any sort of military action has been extremely unpopular since ww2 . 
  seeing as the last time we went to ( total ) war it left the entire country in ruins and divided up , with losses in every family , plus the fact that our army was complicit in heinous crimes against humanity . 
  in such an enviroment it 's not going to be easy to foster readiness to fight any sort of new war . 
  add to this the tendency on the far sides of both political aisles to be somewhat pro-russia . 
  elements of the left call for `` understanding '' of russian policies from a usually anti-american perspective and a disregard for what the actual people in ee think in a somewhat `` cold war '' - esque mentality . 
  elemtents of the right align themselves with the conservative values seen in russia and see more in common with them than with the eu or `` the west '' . 
  there 's also a common argument that there 'd be no point in fighting russia because of the nuclear threat . 
  do you guys also have an english-speaking sub ? 
  we luckily have / r/germany as a firewall for tourists , `` how can i study for free in your country without having to learn the language ? 
  '' , and the obvious t_d-shills so that / r/de is much nicer ( outside of hitting / r/all ), 
  well i 'm not saying that newpapers should * ridicule * them , because i agree with you . 
  i do n't know , should n't there be a middle ground between that and simply * adopting their lingo * ? 
  it 's been used like that , yes , but it 's not inherently so . 
  but there 's a reason we do n't sing the first two stanzas , that 's true . 
  not a fan of the media uncritically using those dudes ' terminology . 
  it 's like 100 people countrywide who travel around to do publicity stunts like this . 
  calling a dozen or so hipsters lying on the floor ( `` blockading '' a building that was closed ) , or climbing on a balcony or whatever `` storming '' and `` occupying '' is to make it look a lot larger and more powerful than it really is . 
  i 'll try not to be a dick about it like the other guy . 
  basically we should keep in mind the context of the ( liberal - ) nationalist movements of the * [ vorm\u00e4rz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vorm%c3%a4rz ) * .
