  in that time , what exactly constituted `` germany '' obviously was n't really clear but the most common view was that it was the extant of the german language . 
  take for example the song * was ist des deutschen vaterland ? '', 
  the song lists various german territories like prussia , the rhineland , or bavaria and then affirms that `` oh no !, 
  / his fatherland must be greater ! '', 
  like in the anthem , this is n't meant in the spirit of later * lebensraum * - ideologies but as a call to unity . 
  one 's fatherland was n't prussia , but germany , ideally encompassing all the germanophone territories . 
  in that spirit , the first stanza is a call to * place * germany `` above all '' , again not in the `` master race '' ideology of later nationalists . 
  still it 's obviously worth mentioning that this is the idealist view , in reality this sort of german nationalism quickly turned illiberal and exclusionary , as evidenced by `` germanisation '' practices against polish and other people inside german territories . 
  so i do understand your objections . 
  not with books like these where it 's part of the entire curriculum which will have covered the nazis from their rise until this point . 
  and not just in history , but other subjects as well . 
  might have worded that awkwardly . 
  i meant that she 's seen as a bulwark and symbol of stability , which makes her attractive to voters in our current time . 
  because it 's the last major election before the national one in the largest european economy , a possible test for the two major candidates of that country 's government leadership office ? 
  left to the gop , i guess . 
  not in the context of our political system . 
  a lot can happen in 4 months , especially since the spd has n't yet released its programme . 
  but the air is getting thin . 
  i think it 's gon na be merkel again , for stability 's sake . 
  i had it at 91 at first but the latest update on the dlf 24 site put it at 101 . 
  if it 's a mistake i 'm sorry , but i 'm no longer at my computer and ca n't check anymore . 
  good overview , thanks !, 
  i 'm on your side mate , i just meme him with his own dumbass statement, 
  well , that just means that they 're gon na have to finish their studies some time in the next 15 years . 
  tough luck . 
  i put forward national polls , you countered with your social circle . 
  thanks for the heads-up , i updated the table !, 
  conservatism = / = religious fundamentalism, 
  that 's still just your personal social circle which , believe it or not , does n't represent the entire country . 
  gee , i guess north korea is truly a democracy then !, 
  if the chancellor were elected direcetly , he 'd have gotten 36 % last thursday , compared to merkel 's 49 % . 
  that 's not nothing . 
  the second part seems like your personal opinion more than anything , but you 're right that people are still unclear what exactly he represents ( according to polls ), 
  their core topic of enviromentalism is n't at the forefront right now . 
  they are also very pro-immigration and tend to block deportations of rejected asylum applicants ( especially those going to afghanistan ) . 
  you could argue that people wish for a stricter stance on immigration and asylum , which would n't be possible with the greens . 
  in general , the greens tend to be accused of being too idealist and * weltfremd * ( ~ living in an ivory tower ), 
  it 's obviously hard to say , since we ca n't look into peoples ' heads but yeah i 'd say so . 
  since our federal system works somewhat like yours , state politics is very important in its own right ( for example , education and law enforcement are near-completely under state sovereignity ) . 
  as an example , the greens in the state of schleswig-holstein won more than double the percentage points last week compared to today 's result . 
  this was already predicted by newspapers , on the basis of the respective state parties ' different strategies . 
  copied from another reply : the current government failed to deliver on high promises on education ( `` no child left behind '' ) , there have been multiple failings involving the spd interior minister ( handling terrorism , especially ) . 
  nrw is n't doing well in comparison to the other states in many measures ( infrastructure , unemployment , crime ) and the current government had n't managed to change that . 
  on a more personal note , the spd held barely anything that could be called a campaign . 
  their posters had pretty much 0 substance and simply did n't talk about any of the relevant problems facing the state . 
  they apparently tried to run on the charisma of their leadership alone and it did n't quite work out . 
  -- concerning schulz : the initial hype has been dying down a while now and now we 'll have to see if there is any substance to it . 
  the party plans to release their programme soon and that 's a good thing because right now they do n't have much more than personality hype ( or lack of ) . 
  we will have to see how things change once the national spd actually releases their party programme . 
  but right now it looks like a cdu win in september . 
  the current government failed to deliver on high promises on education ( `` no child left behind '' ) , there have been multiple failings involving the spd interior minister ( handling terrorism , especially ) . 
  nrw is n't doing well in comparison to the other states in many measures ( infrastructure , unemployment , crime ) and the current government had n't managed to change that . 
  on a more personal note , the spd held barely anything that could be called a campaign . 
  their posters had pretty much 0 substance and simply did n't talk about * any * of the relevant problems facing the state . 
  they apparently tried to run on the charisma of their leadership alone and it did n't quite work out . 
  if the left party fails to gain seats ( unclear right now ) , a cdu-fdp coalition should be possible . 
  #updated values as of 22:46 local time ( last update for today ) !, 
  i 'm using zdf numbers .

  this is also the last state election before the federal elections of this september . 
  state chief of the spd and reigning minister-president of nrw has just resigned from her party post . 
  press release by the [ federal public prosecutor 's office \\ ( gba \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_prosecutor_general_\\ ( germany \\ ) ) :  ** arrest on grounds of suspicion of [ preparation of a serious violent offence endangering the state ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0903 ) **  the gba today , on the basis of an arrest warrant of the invesitgative judge of the [ federal court of justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_court_of_justice ) from 8th may 2017 ,  ordered the arrest of the 27-year-old german citizen maximilian t.  the order was executed in kehl by officers of the federal criminal police office . 
   the defendant is strongly suspected of preparing a serious violent offence endangering the state ( [ \u00a7 89 a abs . 
  2 stgb ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0143 ) ) out of a right-wing extremist ideology and together with the already-arrested franco a. and mathias f.  the press office of the gba will release an explanation to the media today at 14:30 . 
   the arrest warrant lays out the following :  according to investigations , franco a. , mathias f. , and maximilan t. planned an attack on the life of high-ranking politicians and persons of public interest that are active in a , from the defendant 's povs , failed/wrong immigration and asylum policy . 
  in particular , the defendants had created a list of possible victims including different categories . 
  among others it includes [ former president joachim gauck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joachim_gauck ) and [ minister of justice and consumer protection heiko maas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heiko_maas ) . 
  franco a. was tasked with acting out the attack . 
  for this purpose , he had registered as a syrian refugee under an alias . 
  thus , the three defendants wanted to direct suspicion on refugee-applicants in germany . 
  during the planning , franco a. received monetary assitance according to the law , which he collected himself . 
  the resulting abstences were covered up by maximilian t. , who excused franco a. before his superiors . 
  in preparation of the attack , the defendants aquired a pistol by the manufacturer manufacture d\u2019armes des pyrenees francaise , model 17 , caliber 7,65 mm browning , which they first stowed away . 
  in the middle of january , franco a. took the weapon and stowed it in a disabled people 's toilet at the vienna airport where it was found by austrian police shortly after . 
  during investigation , franco a. and mathias f. were ordered to be arrested by the frankfurt state attorney on 26th april 2017 . 
  the investigation has since been taken over by the gba . 
   the attack by the three defendants was supposed to be viewed by the public as a radical-islamic terror act done by an accepted refugee . 
  especially concerning the continued public discussion of immigration and asylum politics a suspected terror attack by a registered refugee would have created special outrage and contributed to a general feeling of threat . 
  recognising this , this case is to be viewed as a crime pertaining to state security of special importance ( [ \u00a7 120 abs . 
  2 , abs . 
  2 gvg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gvg/englisch_gvg.html#p0384 ) )  the defendant will today be brought before the investigative judge of the federal court of justice who will explain to him the arrest warrant and decide over a possible investigative custody . 
  still , if macron wo n't manage to regain the french people 's trust into their system i can see more people abstaining or voting fn next time . 
  as nice as this victory is , it 's absolutely too early to put up our feet .

  like you said , it 's part of it but also more than that . 
  one big reason was that the sa was too strong and confident , parts of it even wanting to replace the reichswehr as the standing army . 
  obviously , the reichswehr was n't a fan of that and since hitler was n't yet 100 % consolidated in power , he acted to earn their trust . 
  purging the `` left '' wing and having revenge on ( former ) enemies was also part of it , of course . 
  a shitpost so important you just * had * to make a new account just for it . 
  thanks , i basically went with what came into my head first so there might be some awkward phrasing or lack of professional terms in it . 
  may wants to handle the other topics in unconventional ways as well : every month one four-day bloc of negotiations in brussels , prepared with position papers . 
  all of that is to be held secret until completion , she demanded . 
  naturally , the tabloid press with a hard-on for brexit * [ sic ! ], 
  is steaming down her neck . 
  but it 's impossible from the p.o.v. 
  of brussels , as every step has to be adjusted with all member states and the european parliament . 
  thus the commission wants to make public its documents immediately . 
  then the biggest point of contention concerning the procedure came up . 
  the eu insists upon a clear order of things : first get the divorce arrangements sorted , then talk about the future relationship .
