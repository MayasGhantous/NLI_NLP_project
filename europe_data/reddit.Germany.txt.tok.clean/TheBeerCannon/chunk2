  according to almost every single poll ever you are wrong . 
  but i 've seen this excuse being thrown around every time this subreddit realises how xenophobic it is , which is absolutely hilarious . 
  neither does the eu . 
  ah , you 're right . 
  it 's easy to get confused in long comment chains with alienblue . 
  my bad . 
  well , now you 're obviously tainting this with your own bias . 
  the poll explicit asked about war refugees . 
  do you understand the concept of rebudgeting ? 
   how much should taxes be raised to pay for immigrants welfare such obvious propaganda . 
  why do n't we send every r_european user to war as soon as they 're physically able to fight ? 
  providing refuge is part of the human rights charta . 
  edit : i am aware that most people on this subreddit could n't care less about human right , but on a federal level , it 's one of the reasons why we are helping refugees . 
  uhm , ca n't both things be a problem simultaneously ? 
   yea you are really reaching with that statement and i 've seen you get personal and borderline harass users stalking their comments as if you think you are doing some sort of pc police duty . 
  there is nothing sarcastic about that comment . 
  you ca n't just write extremist bullshit and then claim it 's `` sarcasm '' . 
  or maybe ... let me try . 
  / r/europe is a racist shithole . 
  just kidding guys , i was just being sarcastic of course . 
  but i understand you , you have to defend your friend from reuropean . 
  propagandists got ta stick together , is n't that the directive ? 
  i do n't hate anyone though . 
  [ two days ago you yourself admitted that you 're spreading propaganda on this subreddit . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t025j/top_eu_diplomat_warns_of_dangers_of_extreme/cx1z8sc?context=3 ) i 'm not apologising for anything or anyone . 
   your stalkery comments you realize that you 're posting in a public medium , yes ? 
   do n't try and guilt-trip him with `` what do you mean someone doing something ? '', 
  as if to imply that the `` something '' is wrong or not necessary . 
  i love the quality of discourse on this subreddit . 
  there is so much panic everywhere in europe right now . 
   i could imagine diesel might have known a feeling like duty . 
  * facepalm *, 
  well , his friends in r_european advocated for shooting muslims for a long time . 
  you 're spreading extremist propaganda , and not for the first time either . 
  they are human and need to be dealed with with the full force of constitutional law and its executive organs . 
  this rhetoric of dismantling our basic values of human rights and legislation will only play in their hands in the long run . 
  mimicking something can be a parody in itself . 
  and frankly , nobody in his right mind believes that critical views towards islam are underrepresented on / r/europe anyway . 
   i do not admit for instance , that a great wrong has been done to the red indians of america or the black people of australia . 
  i do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race , a higher-grade race , a more worldly wise race to put it that way , has come in and taken their place .

  applying the same logic : why do soldiers get awarded medals of honour ? 
  they are just doing their job . 
  oh , i want to believe you 're right . 
  however it 's much more likely that you are quite terribly wrong . 
  in germany ( where we have a much smaller right wing movement mind you ) if somebody yells `` deutschland den deutschen '' he does n't mean germany for the germans and also the black communities and the german muslims who live here since 1-3 generations . 
  they mean germany to the `` pure '' germans - only them . 
  they even exclude political dissidents . 
  i have a really hard time believing that a call like that is harmless and inclusive in the czech republic . 
  and saying you only want czech for the `` true '' czechs is not discrimination in your mind ? 
  is n't it quite obvious from the context ? 
  genuine question : where does racism/xenophobia start for you ? 
  you are so right , you rarely get articles on the frontage of this subreddit that portrait islam or immigrants in a critical way . 
  it 's certainly a repressed fringe opinion here . 
  oh no , do n't get me wrong . 
  / r/europe is almost just as bad . 
  the most vocal people here are largely the same guys as on european anyway . 
   they are as neo nazi as they can get without getting attested . 
  oh , that 's not a problem . 
  the people following them will just claim `` we did n't know , we swear !, 
  we were just following orders ! '', 
  in ten years time . 
  make of that information what you will , but the president of the polling institute insa which conducted this poll [ works as an advisor for the afd too . 
  copycats are always a thing after large scale attacks like those in paris . 
  no way to stop them too , unfortunately . 
   some of the policies are down right lunatic , as are some of their elected members . 
  i definitely agree with you on the member part , but can you list some of the policies you find lunatic ? 
  while some of them might not be appliable to realpolitik , their wahlprogramm on the federal level is quite thought through in my opinion . 
  where there multiple suspects ? 
  on german media it currently says they were after one guy that apparently coordinated the attacks . 
  when you take a look at the afd , do you also see the [ holocaust deniers ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article145307907/afd-mitglied-muss-partei-verlassen-wegen-facebook.html ) , the people who want to [ `` cleanse germany '' ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-10/afd-arppe-anklage-staatsanwaltschaft ) , those [ who think the press is being manipulated ] ( http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article136304254/afd-hat-kein-problem-mit-luegenpresse-vorwuerfen.html ) by a conspiracy of the government and the [ `` literal terrorists '' at their rallies ] ( http://www.thueringer-allgemeine.de/web/zgt/politik/detail/-/specific/mutmasslicher-rechtsterrorist-war-auch-bei-erfurter-afd-demo-182608159 ) ? 
  edit : sources ( l\u00fcgenpresse ), 
   wtf is wrong with people . 
  if you want to read what 's in the mind of people who 'd do something like that , look no further than r_european on this very website . 
   i think all developed countries should be helping refugees . 
  this is probably the first time in weeks that i see a comment like that with a positive score . 
   you can let in immigrants but only highly educated ones and in limited numbers . 
  ehh . 
  at least in germany immigration is also needed for low level jobs that many germans simply ca n't be bothered to do anymore . 
  only letting in highly educated ones would live us drastically understaffed in the public sector for example . 
   this attack the threat is still the exact same : islamism . 
  i agree . 
  let 's just keep in mind that islamism = / = islam as a whole . 
  there are differences , similar to the christian religion being preached in europe , compared to central africa , where it spawned extremist religious militias . 
  i 've seen all sorts of confusion about this distinction . 
   start expelling all foreign nationals marked as radicals by the secret service . 
  as this attack and most of that before it shows , the problem are n't really new arrivals that could be expelled , but european citizens that have more or less been raised here . 
  please do . 
  we 'll see you over there . 
  that 's okay , you do n't need to believe everything . 
  it 's still true though . 
   do n't obfuscate the radical lefts real agenda ( pro-palestine , no matter what atrocities they commit , pro-muslim/islam , because they are brothers in their anti-capitalism/anti-colonialism ) . 
  that 's why i distance myself from radical leftists , especially the palestine part . 
  also there is a pro-muslim sentiment , but at the same time no-one tolerates constructs like the is . 
  probably because it 's not that easy to define radicalism without having to fear the law being severely misused . 
  personally i think the approach we have in germany through `` verfassungsfeindlichkeit '' ( being hostile towards the constitution ) is a bit more practical as it has pre-defined boundaries . 
  actually leftists and antifa movements oppose the is very much as it 's the understanding that the `` state '' bases itself on fascist and anti-human structures . 
  they just do n't want to see this opposition being broadened to muslims in general . 
  the issue is with convicting them of an actual crime . 
  thinking and often even talking in radical ways is not enough to warrant legal action under the current laws .
