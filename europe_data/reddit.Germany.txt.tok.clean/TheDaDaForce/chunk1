ireland ... we 're brothers now that we know . 
  i alone am responsible for 0.15 % of my countrys rate . 
  i dont enjoy it . 
  i do it for my country , and occasionally for others . 
  like half of vatican is gay . 
  do you italians really sing : `` gi\u00e0 l\u2019aquila d\u2019austria , le penne ha perdute . '' ? 
  ( from wikipedia ), 
  yeah , we just think the first verse . 
  and had a former pornstar in parliament . 
  he looks exactly like the kind of landlord who goes into your flat when you 're not home , only he wears a suit instead of a stained wife beater . 
  i bet anywhere he goes it smells like beef and anger . 
  it 's funny how google does n't autocomplete `` naughty '' things , but when googling pics from tom of finland , for example , it gives you the full pride right away . 
  in poland more approve than in germany?what the hell ? 
  ohhhh , you just wait till god reads that . 
  ` jesus the second coming : this time , it 's personal . ', 
  damn those godless czechs and swedes, 
  not shanked , but shagged maybe ? 
  this pic should flood all the subreddits . 
  edit : hahaha i just noticed the guy behind him . 
  edit2 : what did he do to him ?!, 
  look at his eyes !, 
  full of fear but also acceptance . 
  do n't forget some peoples praising of a growing economy and neclecting democracy 's total downfall . 
  * pfft * who has n't had denmark . 
  maybe , or an imposter who leeches off of the glorious federal republics might and reputation . 
  get a room denmark and netherlands . 
  nice try italy . 
  they got the dutch there . 
  after fully accepting their countries role in the armenian genocide and accepting it as a genocide , i 'm afraid he can say that . 
  * assistant leans over and whispers into ear * they what ? 
  the dutch bring the sand , us germaniacs bring the concrete , and denmark is just in so they feel like they 're accomplishing something . 
  ( * they 're awfully sad since they ca n't run around with axes , raiding villages no more . 
  you 're a nazi , and you 're a nazi , and you 're a nazi , we 're all gon na be nazis . 
  wilders is still a shit though . 
  france and italy are stuck in a loop . 
  * pffft * , pathetic . 
  fake !, 
  i mean c'mon switzerland is n't dj bobo , and austria isnt dj \u00d6tzi ? 
  their name is dj !, 
  or are they lying ? 
  are they , were they ever ... my god ... 
  duck that buffoon . 
  war maybe?just a little?maybe?just with those rightwing wankers ? 
  c'mon denmark , all the other countries doing it.i thought you were cool . 
  so what do you say?next friday ? 
  tell you what : we come with a few ships and you just join if you feel like it . 
  cool ? 
  cool . 
  chad uses 99,9 % less electricity , spends 99,4 % less on medical care and uses 99,3 % less oil . 
  it sounds like paradise , till you think about it . 
  ( compared to germany ), 
  everybody rise for the verdict . 
  monsieur sarkozy you too . 
  i read romanian empire , and was baffled for a second . 
  dude , leave what 's rightfully in the past.we 'll just annex it slowly in peace , like mallorca , by only sending the finest most boose and sun resistant germans and get the place at the sun we always deserved !!!, 
  oh my , what ... what the hell was that ... 
  no culture disappearing.heritage still there too . 
  germans do n't look just pale and blonde anymore . 
  oh please , horse belongs in lasagna . 
  sweden and denmark are hilarious . 
  time for volksz\u00e4hlung and ausweisungen . 
  greece is broke , but metal aint ` t. 
  next : the belarusian bloke feeding steven seagal his big carrot . 
  you know , there is lovely germania , like above , with weed on her sword and lesbo germania with that italian gal , but there is also [ `` bitch , say that again to my face '' ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qjfmy ) germania . 
  is england the new usa ? 
  and what the hell does that mean for europe in 200 years ? 
  maybe the russian bear is n't what we all thought after all . 
  uhh , is that a magazin in your pocket or are you just happy to see m. . . oh wait , it 's a cellphone . 
  `` the feast of corpus christi '' sounds so fucking metal . 
  i 'll celebrate from now on , with force . 
  fuck , for once germany tries peaceful annexation and these arsehoes try to fuck it up again . 
  motherfuckers . 
  so from then on it was just the 9 finger shuffle , huh ? 
  oh kut up , that ca n't be true . 
  nice , little luxemburg is crying . 
  are you happy now ? 
  ... while trying not to get an erection . 
  and our child belgium , but also its stepbrother holland . 
  [ and they say we have no humour . 
  ] ( http://www.schleckysilberstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/xmehrinhalteschlecky.jpg,qx23608.pagespeed.ic.965gfjgelu.jpg ), 
  you italians are the best, 
  we all love you belgium ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ netherlands ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not, 
  funny , that was the first thing i thought about . 
  ok , gon na say it : the gayest swastika i 've ever seen . 
  speaking of eurovision and especially lordi , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdxqztjpc4s ) shows even eurovision has its moments . 
  nothing beats 1914 [ germania ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/f_a_von_kaulbach_germania_1914.jpg ) that stare is so ridiculous . 
  first , no boob out ( sad ) . 
  second , france has at least lost a foot in this election . 
  fuck facebook and twitter and the other social media cancer . 
  no one in the right mind would wear this in germany . 
  you would be viewed as very rightwing and that particular flag is just used because [ this ] ( http://www.warstore.co.uk/ekmps/shops/marlina/images/german-ww2-nazi-5-x-3-flag-1494-p.jpg ) is prohibited . 
  the words are the typical rightwing bs about honor , tradition , heritage and so on . 
  and the eagle you see is exactly the one used by the nazis . 
  i can understand india . 
  they have all those indians to deal with already . 
  but shit aside , i 'm pleasantly surprised by us germans although maybe it was merely the phrasing : `` people of a different * race * '' , if it said foreigners the results * could * have been different . 
  that 's just a wild guess though . 
  my anger about great bavaria made me understand the middle east much better . 
  oh , quit your bullshit . 
  nope , i 'm never gon na be proud of weapons , especially not nazi-weapons .
