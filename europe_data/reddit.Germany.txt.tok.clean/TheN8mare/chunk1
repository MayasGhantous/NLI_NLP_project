i 'm just disgusted . 
  disgusted , because you are right and because i experience me becoming right . 
  but what other choice do we have than rejecting what we are not capable of saving ? 
  we did n't . 
  you make migrating to your country extremely easy , keep that in mind . 
  according to me , sweden should immediately close its borders , because minding your ` only ' 9 million inhabitants , you already took far to much foreigners . 
  when i read malm\u00f6 already had 45 % immigrants , i was shocked . 
  natives should never feel alien at their home . 
  you swedes helped incredibly many refugees yet , which is marvelous . 
  minding the burden you ` decided ' to take , sweden deserves the world 's gratitude for centuries . 
  still , i dare you to sacrifice your culture while trying to save the middle eastern people . 
  that is something that honestly never came into my mind . 
  and now that i think about it , an ai may indeed be something really nice !, 
  nevertheless we can not fully displace the risk of losing control or , if we do not understand its supreme decisions , losing trust in this artificial leader and destroying it , following once again our simple human instinct to run into another catastrophic episode of history . 
  you are totally right in saying that todays world is too complex for a single man . 
  i have to admit that i did not think about these kind of problems . 
  but there is still the need of motivation of getting to work in european countries ; everyone is just trying to get out of his concern whilst achieving the greatest possible win in money-matters . 
  maybe i am supposed to correct furthermore : ' a lot of people ' need a leader they can follow , knowing they are doing the right thing and aiming for a truly motivating goal . 
  in the end , there may not be any even theoretical ` perfect ' government . 
  somebody will always have to suffer from mankinds ( or machine-kinds ? ), 
  rules . 
  i want europe to have one very single leader . 
  one leader you can follow , one capital you can truly put your trust in , one single ideology that - as we might figured out together - seems to be the most favorable for human kind . 
  however , thoughts of this kind mostly desire to have that one fundamental issue of an ` evil ' leader being elected like adolf hitler was . 
  nevertheless - we know more than one emperor who has done quite well . 
  an example is the roman emperor marcus aurelius , who decided to be a wise , strong , upright and as well moderate leader . 
  ( watch e.g. 
  ` gladiator ' to learn more ! ), 
  altough he deceased a long time ago , i would like to nominate him for being one of the world 's greatest leaders - europes leader . 
  despite the huge risks a monarchy tends to bear , in monarchy i see the only potentiality of getting all europeans up to lovely work , in order to achieve a significant progress in science ( and wisdom ? ), 
  straight on towards the since-ever-goal of humanity to solve problems of higher tiers , like exploring the universe as well as finally fighting world hunger and maybe satisfying the evergrowing energy needs . 
  but please , dear readers , do not take these words to serious : this are only my personal dream of the perfect eu government and i am very far from believing that this could ( or should ? ), 
  ever be realised . 
  humans ( me obviously inclusive ) are not ready for a single-man-rule yet . 
  skilled migrants are the only migrants we need . 
  two people approach you . 
  they have the same skills , but the first speaks english ( or whatever ) perfectly and looks familiar . 
  the second has an alien accent and alien complexion . 
  so who do you trust more in the first place ? 
  every boss wants maximum productivity in his team . 
  a man from another culture could be a problem . 
  in rational view , you are welcome and needed , but when it comes to decision , people will ( mostly unconciously ) prefer their compatriots . 
  just put you into the boss ' situation . 
  that 's the best we can do . 
  by the time , i 'm learing norwegian and get ready to have every requierment the country asks of me for immigration . 
  better safe than sorry . 
  i do speak swedish , but unfortunately sweden is into the same thing . 
  so i either learn norwegian or move to canada . 
  i 'm totally okay with strict requirements for immigrants , because i am absolutely willing to ** work hard ** and ** assimilate ** to their culture . 
  it somehow makes sure i 'm not running into the same issue there again . 
  swiss is pretty nice as well , but i heard they already have lots of german immigrants and are starting to get tired of it . 
  i do n't want to become the problem i am escaping from . 
  seriously , as long as merkel is doing her shit i hate it , too . 
  nice to have martin sonneborn at europe 's parlament , nevertheless . 
  i have two fucking choices : electing npd next time , trying thus to bring nazi germany into life again , or moving to another country , becoming a refugee myself . 
  i personally do n't like the first one . 
  so bye bye germany , have fun with your newly integrated people . 
  too bad a lot of the actual ` professionals ' are leaving during the next years . 
  i do n't dare to have kids or family here anymore . 
  din vikingj\u00e4vel, 
  german view : spain : pleased with things , never actually working , burning down all the forests france : nice food and clothing , but gay . 
  always shitting their pants when it comes to conflict . 
  portugal : that country that tries to not be spanish belgium : best pommes ever , lightened autobahn netherlands : weed . 
  they do n't really like us . 
  buying food on sundays . 
  funny language . 
  uk : well-mannered but ugly . 
  called ` inselaffen ' ( island apes ) . 
  many readheads . 
  everything is very old . 
  but they are arrogant and claim to speak german without germans actually understanding them . 
  austria : southern germany . 
  probably hate us for thinking this . 
  island : never heard of it . 
  but i can pronounce eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull . 
  danmark : they have whole greenland . 
  whay are they occupying that penis on germanys top ? 
  but we mostly like them very much . 
  germany : everything is normal but the world still hates us because of hitler . 
  italy : well-dressed , attractive , fierce , but lazy as fuck . 
  poland : stealing everthing , guest-friendly ( probably in order to steal the fuck out of you ) sweden : a better germany , everyone is rich and beautiful . 
  incredible friendly . 
  but a little boring . 
  norge : poeple are not as friendly , but richer . 
  they never turn the lights off because they do n't care . 
  finland : drunk as fuck , living in saunas . 
  russia : cs : go flamer . 
  ugly men , beautiful women . 
  dashcams . 
  ugly cars , ugly architecture . 
  turkey : that 's where all my class mates came from . 
  usa : phonies , fat , uneducated . 
  the rich americans are probably assholes . 
  they hate mexicans and blacks . 
  canada : like scandiavia , but in english . 
  very nice . 
  do n't take this too seriously . 
  just writing down the most unprofound thoughts . 
  people say poles are stealing all your shit . 
  there are lots of ` polen-witze ' ( poland jokes ) about this .
