  yes , please !, 
  i \u00b4 m in the lucky situation to live in the native town of ludwig van beethoven . 
  every year in summer , we have the [ beethoven-fest ] ( http://en.beethovenfest.de/ ) in town , with a lot of free concerts and solists playing in the streets . 
  its great !, 
  everybody forgets about that one , 
  currently , i live in a modern appartment building from the 1970s , but the building i grew up in was build in 1906 . 
  many houses in my town are from the so called `` gr\u00fcnderzeit '' between 1880 an the early 1900s , but you can also find wooden-frame houses that go back to the 1600s . 
  the house of my grandparents dates back to the 1680s . 
  it \u00b4 s a wooen-frame house build with straw and clay , but during the centuries every generation added a layed of paint , wallpaper or plaster . 
  exept for the kitchen and the bathroom ( both were added in the 1950s ) , you can \u00b4 t find a room with straight walls or ceilings . 
  insulation is still pretty good , though . 
  edit : when i visited friends in new zealand a few years back , and it totally hit me when i learned that the oldest building in the town i was staying was from 1849 . 
  just then i realized that i am used to see churches on my daily commute that are 1200 years old . 
  according to wikipedia , there were two mosques build in germany prior wwii . 
  [ the older one ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/halbmondlager ) was build in 1915 for muslim pows but was torn down again in the 1920s because the wooden structure started to rott . 
  [ the other one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_mosque ) was build in 1924 and is still in use . 
  ** best : ** i have to concur with u/asyx and u/aschebecher , [ zwiebelmett ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mett ) , [ j\u00e4gerschnitzel ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a4gerschnitzel ) and [ himmel und erde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himmel_und_erde ) are my top 3 as well . 
  allthough by far nokt as hardcore as the swedish original , i would go so far as to call it the german surstr\u00f6mming . 
  i just can \u00b4 t stand the smell . 
  aspic . 
  not so much because of the taste , but mostly because of the texture . 
  potato salad with cooked eggs . 
  why on earth would any sane person spoil this perfect dish with raw eggs ?? 
  the thing about german couisine is that there is a huge variety of local dishes . 
  this one is common in the north-west , from lower saxony to westfalia and the rhineland ( where i \u00b4 m from ) . 
  in the cologne / bonn area , you can get it in any traditional brauhaus or restaurant . 
  it \u00b4 s rather uncommon anywhere else . 
  mashed potatoes and mashed apples with fried blood sausage and onions . 
  not only has it a very poetic name , it also tastes really delicious . 
  time masters aka . 
  the main actors dubbed semselfs in the german version . 
  what makes it even more awesome . 
  the public library in my town of 300.000 has 10 branches , including one devoted to music only and is funded solely by the city . 
  in all , there are 330.000 different medias , including books , cds , cd-roms , dvds , games , musical scores , newspapers , magazines , audiobooks and e-papers . 
  there \u00b4 s also an online catalogue , through wich i can search for medias , extend the loan period , make reservations and make interlibrary loans . 
  as far as i know , it is possible to make interlibrary loans from every public library in germany , including munincipal , state and federal libraries and university libraries . 
  after about 15 years of having no library card for my local library , i just got me a new one last week . 
  the library card is free , but there are some loan charges on some medias : - books : 0,50 $ for 4 weeks - dvds , cds , dc-roms : 1 $ - books from the children section are free it is also possible to pay an annual fee in advance , so i payed 15 $ and now i can loan as many books as i want .

  i just came here to say this . 
  the truth ^ tm, 
  maybe the netherlands . 
  last year in august , i went to zandfort near haarlem with two friends . 
  although it was just for four days , it was really nice . 
  the weather was great , for swimming in the sea , we were on a camping area right in the middle of the dunes . 
  we are thinking about doing it again this year . 
  if you happen to come trough [ bonn , germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonn ) , the best kebab at least for me ) is orint express . 
  [ here \u00b4 s a review ] ( http://getestet.wordpress.com/2007/07/25/falafel-wie-ein-zug-orient-express-in-bonn/ ) in german , i \u00b4 m sure google translate can help , 
  please , it \u00b4 s `` mutti '' . 
  nope . 
  i decided to do something useful with my time and joined the volunteer fire brigade , 
  if you look at the situation in greece , spain and italy right now , with many people without work , i think that , at leats in these countries , the disappointment is pretty widespread . 
  also , people do realise that the crisis is not over yet . 
  he \u00b4 s over there ... splitter !, 
  so ... could somebody give me a serious ( ! ), 
  eli5 on what that means ? 
  i personally don \u00b4 t feel offenden by somebody who is interested in the subject and starts to ask questions . 
  what is awkward and may be seen as offensive is when you come to germany and either start praising the nazis or do the old `` you lost , you fucking krauts !, 
  '' - dance . 
  depends . 
  you learn about it in school , there are memorials in public places and there are lots and lots of tv documentations . 
  in my family , it never was a `` forbidden '' topic . 
  even my grandparents sometimes talked about their war experiences ( something i am very thankfull for ) . 
  however , there are many families that do not talk about this time in private , and many people still don \u00b4 t know what their grand - and greatgrandparents did back then . 
  my point is that imo there is no `` european culture '' , therefore this argument is invalid if you want to use it in a discussion if mosques should or should not be build . 
  if you want to follow your arguent , christianity and therefore churches are `` uneuropean '' as well , since christianity evolved from a jewish sect in palestine . 
  also , to conclude that mosques are `` against european culture '' because of this survey is absolutely oversimplyfied and dishonest . 
  the question of the poll was if they are ok with mosques , not if there is a unified european culture . 
  try harder . 
  i wrote `` single examples '' , that \u00b4 s the plural . 
  still not a definition of `` european culture '' . 
  because a common european culture doesn \u00b4 t exist . 
  that \u00b4 s just single examples of european artists and pieces of art , but not a definition of `` european culture '' . 
  please define `` european culture '' . 
  as long as you supply the rest of us with your tasty whisky , you can do what you want . 
  but i have to admit , i \u00b4 m absolutely clueless about the eventual economic implications .

  ** germany ** the beginning : in the year of 1870 , in the days when a man was judged only by how awesome his moustach was , prussian chancelor [ otto von bismarck ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vc2oa3grhx4/tu2ec0ygmqi/aaaaaaaaa9k/b_gd_reuvlm/s1600/bismarck2.jpg ) and french emperor [ napoleon iii . 
  ] ( http://tomas6.szm.com/obrazky/novovek/francuzsko/napoleon_iii.jpg ) got into a quarrel on which souvereign could sport the more awesome beard . 
  said it was him , while bismarck supported his souvereign , [ king wilhelm i. of prussia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/e/e8/1797_wilhelm_i.jpg ) , who was backed by [ ludwig ii. , king of bavaria ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/ludwig_ii_portrait_by_gabriel_schachinger.jpg ) , [ king karl of w\u00fcrttemberg ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/karl-w%c3%bcrttemberg.jpg ) and [ friedrich i. , grandduke of baden ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/frederikib.jpg ) . 
  napoleon couldn \u00b4 t handle it and ordered his [ garde r\u00e9publicaine du moustache ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/neuville_alphonse_marie_de_the_hussars.jpg?uselang=de ) to `` show these bosches how a real beard looks like ! '' . 
  unfortunately for him , they where no match for the german special forces of this time like the bavarian [ `` bayrische bartj\u00e4ger '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/louis_braun_-_bayerischer_infanterist_max_lehner_krankentr%c3%a4ger_der_sanit%c3%a4tskompanie.jpg ) or the prussian [ `` schnurrbart-hussaren '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/prussian_hussars.jpg ) . 
  eventually , napoleon had to give in and , as the man he was , [ apologised to bismarck ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/bismarckundnapoleoniii.jpg ) and accepted wilhelm i. as `` emperor of the moustaches ( and germany ) '' . 
  he even went as far as to offer his modest manor in versaille for the [ crowning ceremony ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/wernerprokla.jpg ) . 
  ever since , the facial hair of a man had to be the equivalent of his social status . 
  this , however , should also lead to the end of the germnan empire , when [ wilhelm ii. , king of prussia and german emperor ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/wilhelm_ii_of_germany.jpg ) came to power . 
  wilhelm , who was coursed with the `` crooked-beard '' - syndrome , just couldn \u00b4 t handle the fact that he would always stay in the beardy shadows of his father , [ friedrich `` siede-stache '' wilhelm ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/wil2-f.jpg ) and his cousins [ edward vii .
