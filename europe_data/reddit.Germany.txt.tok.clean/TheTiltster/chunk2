  you can purchase .40 cal in germany ( as long as you meet the legal and administrative requirements ) , but selfloading rifles are very limited . 
  they are legal ( in fact , you can buy an ar-15 in germany ) , but only in single-fire-mode and only with 10-rounds-mags . 
  thanks to the schengen agreement , we can do just that .

  this controvercy also included a very close consultant of adenauer , [ hans globke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_globke ) . 
  globke had become a high ranking civil servant in 1929 , and even before hitler became chancellor , globke made preparations for the first anti-semitic laws that would later be adopted by th nazis . 
  he also worked on the `` emergency law '' of 1933 that would give hitler absolute power and wrote the official legal commentary ( sort of a manual on how to `` use '' a law ) on the [ nuremberg racial laws ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuremberg_laws ) .

  there are some evangelic christians in germany ( especially hesse ) , but they are a very , very ( tiny ) small minority . 
  actually , i can \u00b4 t think of one single occasion where the topic of creationism ever came up in a piublic debate . 
  fyi , in my family we call these people `` salachristen '' , a pun of the word `` salafisten '' ( salafists ) , their muslim counterparts . 
   and of course , you ca n't simply join/merge all these different armies , soldiers and their equipment together . 
  i do agree with you on the political aspects of this question , but a standardization regarding technical equipment and command structures has allready been accomplished by nato . 
  so , no real problem there . 
  imho , the real issue is the political process leading to an engagement . 
  the more the merrier . 
  those people who helped hitler getting into power where national conservatives who thought that democracy was something `` ungerman '' and yes , those people did dream of a glorious return of the kaiser , after they had gotten rid of hitler and his gang . 
  so , it \u00b4 s a hell no !, 
  from me as well . 
  i think that u/panto81s comment was more in general , not in your direction .

  the `` abstract '' posted by op is pretty tendencious . 
  better read the full paper . 
   although relatively speaking levels of fundamentalism and out-group hostility are much higher among muslims , in absolute numbers there are at least as many christian as there are muslim fundamentalists in western europe , and the large majority of homophobes and antisemites are still natives .

  between 1904 and 1907 they comitted a genocide against the indigenous [ herero and nama ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide ) people in namibia . 
  and thanks to my google skills , i found this litte [ review ] ( http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1268 ) in english on a book titled `` german colonialism . 
  a short history '' . 
  a little excerpt : `` the english edition also benefits from the addition of maps , and a large number of illustrations . 
  these provide a fascinating and often shocking visual accompaniment to the text . 
  they include cartoons from contemporary german satirical publications , along with pictures and photographs which record , amongst other things , visual symbols of oppression like the identification tags worn by africans in german south west africa after 1907 , or which otherwise illustrate the pitiless nature of much of german conquest . 
  one photograph shows workers in togo harnessed to cotton wagons in place of draft animals , which , conrad tells us , were difficult to keep alive in the climate here . 
  another photograph , taken in the omaheke desert in 1905 , which captures the stares of a group of emaciated herero , also stands out , as does a contemporary illustration of german soldiers packing the skulls of ` hanged ' and ` fallen ' herero women into crates , prior to their transportation back to germany for the research of phrenologists . '', 
  from what i know , it wasn \u00b4 t as brutal as this in the rest of the colonies , but in general it can be said that the indigenous population was always regarded as a lesser kind of man that needed it \u00b4 s white master to be rescued .
