  from the wiki article on former german colonies ( yes , for a few decades even germany had colonies ) : `` there are hardly any special ties between modern germany and its former colonies ; for example , there is no postcolonial league comparable to the british commonwealth of nations . 
  in stark contrast with french and english , both of which are widely spoken across the continent by those of both african and european ancestry , the german language is not a significant language in africa even within former colonies ; although it is spoken by a significant minority of the population of namibia . 
  germany cooperates economically and culturally with many countries in africa and asia , independent from colonial history . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_colonial_empire ) i think that summs it up pretty well . 
  there are relations like cultural exchanges and such between the german community in namibia and a number of cities and smaller towns in germany , but that was it . 
  eschbach is still alive and well . 
  his last book was published in 2013 . 
  so for me he \u00b4 s a contemporary author . 
  the jesus vidoe was simply the first book that came to my mind . 
  he gave a reading of one of his books at hobbitcon earlyer this year but i couldn \u00b4 t hear it . 
  is it worth a read ?

  [ kinderhymne ( children \u00b4 s hymn ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7gkibcpz1s ) lyrics by bertolt brecht , music by hanns eisler children 's hymn [ spare no grace or pains of yours ] 1 . 
  spare no grace or pains of yours spare no passion or insight so that a good germany flowers like many another good country . 
  so that the peoples do not turn pale before us as before a bird of prey -- but that they reach out their hands to us as to other peoples . 
  and so that we desire to be not above , and not below other peoples , from the ocean to the alps , from the oder to the rhein . 
  and because we are tending to this land , may we love and protect it ; and may it seem to us the dearest , just as to others their own land seems . 
  the lyrics match the music of the current german anthem [ ( deutschlandlied ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeodqc3wk4 ) as well as the anthem of east germany [ ( auferstanden aus ruinen ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtv92wqyjfa ) . 
  from the english wiki article : `` children 's hymn '' is the english name of a poem by bertolt brecht , `` kinderhymne '' , written in 1950 and set to music by hanns eisler in the same year . 
  the hymn was brecht 's response to the introduction of the third stanza of the deutschlandlied , which he believed to be corrupted by the third reich , as national anthem of west germany in 1950 . 
  there are several allusions to the west german hymn , e.g. 
  the `` deutschlandlied '' 's `` from the meuse to the memel , from the adige to the belt '' vs. brecht 's `` from the ocean to the alps , from the oder to the rhine '' or `` germany , germany above all '' vs. `` we desire to be not above , and not below other peoples '' . 
   `` yes , '' the engineer answers `` when you have a wife and a mistress , both of them think you spend your time with the other one .

  ii guess you \u00b4 re not the only one who didn \u00b4 t get that line , 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9xjel2mnpw ), 
  a architect , a artist and a engineer talk about what is better , to have a wife or to have a mistress . 
  the architect says that he enjoys the time with his wife because marriage gave their relationship a stable basis . 
  the artist says that he likes to have a mistress because this would make their relationship more passionate and full of mysteries . 
  the engineer says : `` i love both . '', 
  `` both ??? '', 
  the artist and the architect ask startled . 
  `` yes , '' the engineer answers `` when you have a wife and a mistress , both of them think you spend your time with the other one .

  in summer 2005 , i took part in an international wildfire camp , organized by greece \u00b4 s biggest volunteer fire service [ \u0395.\u03a3.\u0395.\u03a0.\u0391 ] ( http://www.esepa.gr/en/ ) . 
  four weeks of sweating , eating and driving through the country , together wirth fire fighters from 5 different countries . 
  what i remember : * awesome food * [ tsipouro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsipouro ) * at noon it was so hot that we usually made a very long nap . 
  you \u00b4 re accsing me of generalizing , whilst saying `` you , pro gay people '' . 
  well , then i gave a statement just as simple as yours . 
   so if it was his deterrence strategy , it failed . 
  mybe he or his councellors hope that obama doesn \u00b4 t want to get involved into another war . 
   unless you mean deterring them by using the weapons against even more civilians ? 
  that \u00b4 s what i was thinking . 
  he could hold the population hostage . 
   and on the side note , what if it 's neither the rebels nor assad , but a ` rougue ' commander , using the weapons without any authorisation or knowledge of the government ? 
  absolutely possible , on both sides . 
  either a sa army officer who lost it or a rebel group acting on its own . 
   it does n't benefit assad in any way . 
  deterrence . 
   us 's modus operandi of creating a terrorist organization please ellaborate . 
   if we were really against chemical weapons , we would n't have used them in iraq . 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  i \u00b4 m really not sure who could be responsible . 
  i \u00b4 m pretty sure that assad has it in him to do something like that . 
  he wouldn \u00b4 t be the first despote to do so . 
  on the other hand , i also see that it could be a manouver from one of the rebel factions with the hope to get an active involvement from other forces on their side . 
  but i doubt that the islamists have an interest of an american or european involvement . 
   your links give the impression of the bad serbian and the good german . 
  yeah , i guessed that . 
  i choose these examples because of my personal experiences living in germany . 
  i don \u00b4 t think that something like in my first link could happen here hwo it happend in serbia , at least not anymore . 
  on the other hand , living in a town next to cologne ( germanys san fransisco ) , i \u00b4 ve never seen gay people beating the crap out of straight people . 
  maybe because anti-gay people tend to do [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgrade_anti-gay_riot ) while pro-gay people are more like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axeql9g6t0c ) . 
  so hate and violence vs. fun and party . 
  not this incident , but there have been other incidents in g\u00f6ttingen that raise questions . 
  for example , a party member called the police one night and said that he had seen `` hooded persons '' in his front yard . 
  police came out , but couldn \u00b4 t find any footprints . 
  the police stayed in friont of the house the rest of the night . 
  according to the [ article ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/bundestagswahl-2013/afd-goettinger-wirrwarr-12545574.html ) that describes this incident , the same guy later wrote that in this night , somebody had poured gasoline on his wall . 
  the police stated , that this hadn \u00b4 t been told the officers on scene . 
  the same article quotes a police officer who is an expert for the extreme left , who sayes that actions like that are `` extremely atypical '' . 
  also , according to the article , the afd released a statement that statedthat the campainging booth in the inner city of g\u00f6ttingen had to be secured by 60 police officers , while the police said that they only had 40 police officers in the inner city and that this number would be normal for a campaining weekend . 
  victimising itself has always been part of how the afd regarded itself . 
  other german sources suggest that some of the incidents and allegations that afd-people have reported , are simply mad up . 
  ps : this is the [ `` wembley 1966 '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghost_goal ) reference . 
  that \u00b4 s awesome , thanks !, 
  til : [ grassy knoll ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grassy%20knoll ) a metaphor and a source of irony when referring to a suspicion , conspiracy , or a cover-up of some type . 
  * you 'll find all your answers on the grassy knoll *, 
  that was wilhelm i. you \u00b4 re not taking that from us !!, 
  yeah . 
  poland attacked germany . 
  and the soviet union . 
  at the same time . 
  and they are also responsible for pearl harbor , wembley 1966 , the early canceling of battlestar galactica and my dirty kitchen . 
  no problem . 
  i \u00b4 m not saying that gmos are useless . 
  actually , i do believe that this is just the next logical step after breeding , cultivating and grafting . 
  however , i still think that some societies live above their means on the expense of others . 
  gmos can make an impact on mankinds developement , but i think they shouldn \u00b4 t be used to `` treat the symptoms '' . 
  and on monsanto , they did a good deal of damage to the reputation of gmos . 
   you realize the majority of today 's population would n't be here today without gmos got any sources on that ? 
  exept for press releases by monsanto ? 
   the complete banning of gmos would lead to a famine that would kill millions , one that would make both mao 's great leap forward and stalin 's holodomor look like a joke in comparison . 
  if you could please stop that mccarthyan babble , that \u00b4 le be great . 
  on another notion , according to the ec , in [ europe allone 90 milion tons of food per year are wasted . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=europa+nahrungsmittel+zerst%c3%b6rung&amp;page=2 ) another , yet a bit more complex effect of gm food , are [ high suicidal rates of indian farmers . 
  worth a read . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/farmers'_suicides_in_india )  it is n't a question when talking about gmos having huge benefits for humanity , it 's a fact . 
  so , you would rather feed people with potenmtially harmfull food instead of trying to equalize the access to clean water and farmland ? 
  right now , the western world feeds on the rest , and thats a fact too .
