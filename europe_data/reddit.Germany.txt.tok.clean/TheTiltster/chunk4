  regarding the possible consequences , yes , we should . 
  in germany , depending on the state , you \u00b4 ll never pay more than 700 $ for one semester . 
  i \u00b4 m at cologne university of applied sciences and i payed around 250 $ , including my ticket for public transportation for my region . 
  between bon n and d\u00fcsseldorf i can take every bus or subway without paying extra , plus i ` m allowed to ried with ervery local train of deutsche bahn in the whole state . 
  edit : you can also apply for a appartment in a student dorm . 
  if you \u00b4 re lucky , you get a small appartment for yourself or at least a room in a shared appartment with 3 to 4 other guys for about 260 $ per month . 
  shure they are , lutherans and calvinists are both protestants . 
  but , like in so many religoius matters , it \u00b4 s all about the details .

  so , the confused babble of a mp from bavaria is now a `` discussion '' ? 
  i think it \u00b4 s awesome . 
  that \u00b4 s kind of a vague question ... what country ? 
  what field ?

  after googleing `` proselytism '' , yes , it sucks !, 
  yeah , we don \u00b4 t have a national standard for currywurst ( yet ) , so quality differes a lot . 
  but what person with a sane mind would drink green beer ? 
  just what i thought , 
  [ what ? 
  yes !!!, 
  for a few years during my undergrad studies i used to work in a cinema as a projectionist with the occasional sunday shift , beginning at 10 in the morning . 
  on more than one of these sundays , a schnitzel hollandaise saved my life !, 
  if it \u00b4 s a good one , i like my currywurst as a small snack or with additional fries as a full meal during the day . 
  as a going-home-food i prefer d\u00f6ner . 
  for the day after , i can only recommend a schnitzel with fries and [ hollandaise sauce ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hollandaise_sauce ) . 
  one of the best hangover cures !, 
  one of my favourite food after a long night before going home is a specialty only served at a small take-away-pizza shop in my town . 
  they call it pizza pazza , it \u00b4 s basically pizza with highly enriched garlic suace . 
  translation : in the contingency planing of my town , one of the jobs assigned to the volunteer units is `` preservation of local traditions '' , meaning this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=yztlujpgzec, 
  that sucks big time !, 
  what were you doing exactly ? 
  i don \u00b4 t believe you were doing sunday school , right ? 
  pssst , thats a secret !!, 
  wow , that \u00b4 s pretty impressive !, 
  ever checked out [ this page ] ( http://www.volunteerism-cc.org.cy/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;itemid=93&amp;lang=el ) ? 
  i made the experience that doing something for others is always s great boost for ones self-confidence . 
  so just out of couriosity , where exactly is `` here '' ? 
  and because i started it , here \u00b4 s my story . 
  i \u00b4 m a [ volunteer fire fighter ] ( http://www.ff-endenich.de/ ) in a small unit in my town . 
  i started becomeing involved when i was 15 . 
  one of my friends from school was already a junior ff . 
  i got courious and joined in a training session one evening and have been with the bunch since then . 
  wwhat we do on a regular basis has not much to do with what you might see in tv or in movies . 
  we also have a `` professional '' fire service , so we are more like a auxillary unit . 
  in the 15 years i \u00b4 m doing this now i \u00b4 ve only once fought a `` real '' fire . 
  most of our calls we had in the last few months were weather related , meaning pumping water out of cellars or clearing trees from roads and cars . 
  we also do theater watches and fire watches at big evenst like concerts or carnivals , which is pretty fun most times . 
  dude ... this is epic !!!!,

  lol , oh stop , you !, 
  yeah , you got a point there . 
  `` northern '' potato salad = with mayonaise `` southern '' potato salad = only vinegar and some vegtable oil personally , i prefer the latter , especially in summer .

  wow , thanks for the clarification . 
  and i \u00b4 m defenitely with you in that `` germans '' - thing . 
  germany has been an immigration country for 60 years but our lawmakers took a long time to finally get rid of these ius sanguinis-definitions . 
  care to explain ? 
  `` ende s\u00e4mtlicher streckenverbote ( d ) '' if you see this sign on the autobahn , it basically says `` beyond this point , you \u00b4 re allowed to go as fast a your ride can possibly go . '' .

  in 2000 i participated in a school exchange with a school in warsaw . 
  when we went to auschwitz concetration camp , we were greeted by some polish skinheads who were yelling insults at the visitors . 
  one of them even had swastika suspenders . 
  just a thing i noticed when discussing the matter of headscarves and womens rights , many people ( especially men ) who come up with the argument that islam enslaves women , also in many cases share the thought that a womans place is at home and that they should care for the household and the kids . 
  justr my personal observation . 
  i \u00b4 m just back from a short holiday on the dutch coast , so my impressions are still very fresh . 
  * very bike friendly * frikandel speciaal * frittesauce * vla, 
  come on , do you even try ? 
  oh come on , you can do better . 
  aww , how cute ...

  why do you aks a question and then answer it yourself ? 
  i know that some people say that tolkien described the second world war in tlotr although he always denied it , but i don \u00b4 t understand what this has to do with mount doom in serbia ? 
  i don \u00b4 t think that happend intentionally . 
  the author of the map took hobbiton and oxford ( home of jrrt ) as fix points and then alligned the maps in a 1:1 - scale along their north-south-east-west orientation . 
  i don \u00b4 t think that serbia beeing in the same place like mordor happend intentionally . 
  although i don \u00b4 t think that this was intended , it gives you a very good idea on the size of middle earth and why ithilien resembles the regions around the mediteranean sea . 
  in the book , bilbo sees the lonely mountain for the first time when the company leaves mirkwood forrest . 
  i guess pj took this shot to have an `` outlook '' for the next movie . 
  question for op : how did you come up with the idea that the eu could `` prohibit '' monarchies ? 
  yeah , but why is it black ? 
  try harder .
