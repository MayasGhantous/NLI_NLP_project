  i \u00b4 m sorry , but this just doesn \u00b4 t correlate with my personal experiences . 
  inmy experience , people from north africa and the middle east who come to my country to study integrate themself way better than peopl from china . 
  also , just because a single ethnic group doesn \u00b4 t cause `` trouble '' , it does not mean that they integrate well . 
   the immigration definitely needs to be slowed down . 
  stop the migration of muslims and try and get some asians or americans . 
  it doesn \u00b4 t matter where somebody comes from , assholes are bred all over the world . 
  asia has a big muslim community , didn \u00b4 t yoou know that ? 
  and from my experience , asians can be dickholes too . 
  the ability of integration always depends on education , not necessarily where somebody was born . 
  then why didn \u00b4 t you post a direct link to the original source ? 
  the source you posted allready lost all cred because of its title . 
  amen !, 
   http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/opinion-polls.htm and of course this is an absolutely unbiased and objective source . 
  these conflicts are a result of the colonial politics during the late 19th and early 20th century . 
  did you ever ask yourself why the borders of countries in north africa and arabia look like they where drawn with a ruler ? 
  because they actually where drawn that way , on a table in berlin . 
  these borders reflect only spheres of influence , not religion or ethnicities of the people living there . 
  edit : [ source ] ( http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/berlinconferenc.htm ), 
  sometimes it is a real draback , but most times it \u00b4 s simply anoying . 
  for example , every state can determine legal holidays and school holidays . 
  of course , these holidays are determined by the major christian confession of the states population . 
  i \u00b4 m living in the rhineland , and the tradition of [ karneval ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carnival_in_germany,_switzerland_and_austria ) is much stronger here than in most of the country . 
  so if a guy from bavaria tries to call a company or a public service department during these five days , he \u00b4 ll have no luck because everybody is out getting drunk and commiting excesses . 
  some real drawbacks imo are that every state has its own school system , so there are 16 different standards out there . 
  a real severe drawback is that there are 17 ( ! ), 
  intelligence agencies working in an almost competetive fashion . 
  one result of that is that a [ gang of neo-nazis ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-nsu-neo-nazi-trial-starts-in-munich-a-898287.html ) was allowed to run around and kill people . 
  edit : i should mention that i absolutely enjoy the cultural diversity in my country , but this is not to be mistaken with the `` official '' administrative federalism . 
  might be i say it because of this . 
  even as a german , i wasn \u00b4 t aware of how diverse germany and it \u00b4 s culture and language was until i started studying with people from all over the country . 
  edit : just to clarify what `` federalism '' means in germany , [ here \u00b4 s a document ] ( http://www.bruessel-eu.diplo.de/contentblob/1469816/daten/3345675/download_vertreter_deutsche_firmen.pdf ) that lists german representations with the eu . 
  every german state has its own office . 
  i don \u00b4 t think it would work out because the cultural differences and the differences in the administrative and law systems are just to big . 
  my bad , you and / u/bezbojnicul are absolutely right . 
  i hope my edit is more to the point . 
  although jobbik might not be part of the government , i get the impression that they work together very close , like here : https://hungarianspectrum.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/another-blunder-by-fidesz-jobbik-naming-a-street-after-the-anti-semite-cecile-tormay/, 
   it 's right-wing conservative-nationalist , but it 's no way a `` nazi party '' . 
  that might me true for his fidesz party , but his ~ ~ junior partner in the parliament ~ ~ sidekick , [ jobbik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik ) , is defenitely more than just `` conservative-nationalist '' . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_revolution_of_1918%e2%80%9319 ) . 
  there \u00b4 s a nice documentary on germany by al murray called [ `` al murray 's german adventure '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ix0zdx1i2w ) . 
  then there \u00b4 s a series , produced by the bbc , called [ `` german wanderlust '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypmheg74yms ) that shows some nice hicking paths . 
  lots of scenery  in the last few years , public television has produced a series on german history , begining with otto i. , founder of the holy roman empire and ends with the foounding of the weimar republic . 
  its called [ `` die deutschen '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcc31oost4k ) . 
  and then there \u00b4 s a program called [ `` wild germany '' ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_germany ) . 
  they do these awesome documetaries on all kinds of sub cultures , like larp , furries , illegal immegranst and so on . 
  i highly doubt that this `` free movement '' included all the freedoms we have today ( no custoums , travelling only with personal id , not with travel passport etc. 
  my last history lesson in school is allready a few years back . 
  i think , these topics were discussed briefly : * ancient greece and the roman empire * holy roman empire * thirty years ' war * colonisation of africa and america * french revolution * american independance * industrialisation in in the uk and germany what we did more in depth : * situation in germany during ww i * revolution of 1918 , declaration of the republic , treaty of versailles * weimar republic , great depression , rise of the nazi party * third reich , ww ii , holocaust , end of war , post-war time until 1950 topics i found interesting / relevant for me that where covered ionly very briefly or wheren \u00b4 t covered : * german history in eastern europe * napoleonic wars * revolution of 1848 * civil war in the us right now , a very `` hot '' topic for me is the developement in germany after 1950 , especially the influence of former / old nazis in west germany . 
  scary shit !, 
  good for you , then . 
  well , the right one of course !, 
  what did you think ? 
  so , only the bible states the one and only true moral , then ? 
  i highly doubt that . 
  yeah , thats so in ever country where `` christians '' are involved in politics . 
  just pathetic . 
  the basics : arschloch - asshole dumme / bl\u00f6de kuh - stupid cow the heavy artillery : hurensohn - son of a whore fotze - cunt for an academic dialogue : evolutionsbremse - assessment that the adressed opersons genes are a setback for the evolution of the human race troglodyt - assumption that the adressed person is the last member of a ( almost ) extinct early humanoid race, 
  ` i do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man ; she must be quiet . \u00b4 1 timothy 2:12, 
  basically . 
  doesn \u00b4 t make much sense , i know , 
  it derives from this : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaltschale, 
  colloquial name for beer in germany : hopfenkaltschale, 
  naa , more like [ `` scared elephant '' ] ( http://s3images.coroflot.com/user_files/individual_files/original_169711_wsp90dljeds3bq6aqopgfzoih.jpg ) . 
  interesting article . 
  my humble toughts : my guess is that germany not wanting to be the leading nation in europe is based on our historical experience of being europes `` wisdom tooth '' . 
  germany as a coherent nation was established centuries after the other `` traditional '' global players , like france , spain , great britain etc. 
  and now , after two world wars , 40 years of forced division , germany is just content with its role as the `` gentle giant '' . 
  this one made my day xd, 
   it is widely believed to be a hangover remedy . 
  i \u00b4 ll certanly try that !, 
  it \u00b4 s always good to have a recipe for that at hand . 
  oh yeah , i remember these !, 
  for a few month i lived with a polish flatmate who used to pamper us with stuff like that . 
  by the way , this is my favourite from my region , the rhineland , germany : [ himmel und erde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himmel_und_erde ) [ how to make it ] ( http://germanfood.about.com/od/potatoesandnoodles/r/himmelunderde.htm ) . 
  stil doesn \u00b4 t make germany a `` islamic '' country . 
  muslims make 2-5 % of the overall population , depending on the [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_germany#islam ) . 
  the last time i checked , my country was still a secular republic ( alltough , religion as a whole has stil too much influence in politics than i would like it ) . 
  no problem . 
  is there any source where i could see this duiscussion ( with subtitles ) ? 
  you \u00b4 re right , i \u00b4 ve should have postred more context . 
  aaaaand ... it \u00b4 s gone !, 
  guess you \u00b4 re right  i \u00b4 m just trying to fix my phone , took a bit . 
  thanks , but this is not what i \u00b4 m looking for . 
  maybe i should have been a bit more precise . 
  people who are missing some of their teeht and / or who wer jump suits ?? 
  not very helpfull ... edit : [ now , that 's a clue !, 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chav ) in german , these guys would be called prolls ( prolet = proletarian ) or assi ( asozialer = antisocial ), 
  ca you give a definition of who or what a `` chav '' is ? 
  neuer hear that word before . 
  writing the title in caps lock makes it so much more credible . 
  source ? 
  30 days of payed vacation plus 11 religious and national holidays ( but usually 2-3 of them are on a weekend ) . 
  edit : germany , north rhine-westphalia, 
  thanks , obama !, 
  hey people from / r/europe , i \u00b4 m a master student at the cologne university of applied sciences in germany . 
  i \u00b4 m just about to write my master thesis about the map symbology used in the german disaster management.in one chapter i would like to discuss diferences and similarities between symbologies in other eu countries , preferable from our neighbours . 
  i already did some extensive online searching and found something , but i hope to find more . 
  if you are a user involved in disaster management in your country or if you know any sources , you would do me a huge favor if you could share it with me . 
  thanks in advance , til p.s. 
  : i allready have the symbologies from denmark , the netherlands , poland and the uk and the nato standard app 6 .
