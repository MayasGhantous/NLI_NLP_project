  no , there were articles and tv reports about it the day after . 
  but it was a developing story and the scale and significance of this incident was misinterpreted by some news outlets . 
  also hygienic products seem to be more expensive in hungary . 
   i paid 6 cents per br\u00f6tchen in portugal . 
  against around 12 cents in a german discounter while germans earn 2,5 times more on average than portuguese . 
  consuming goods in spain are a little bit cheaper in general , but rents are higher than in germany while people earn less . 
  italy has pretty much the same prices for a lot of goods . 
  germany is even a little bit cheaper right now . 
  [ source 1 ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=cpl ) [ source 2 ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=av_an_wage ), 
  the oecd comparative price level is for basic goods . 
  it indicates the number of us dollars needed in each country to buy the same representative basket of consumer goods .

  also traveled through europe and most of the time i had the feeling things were more expensive outside of germany . 
  i dare you to find better prices in western europe than in a german discounter ( 18 cents for a 1,5 l bottle of water e.g. 
  so what do you think ? 
  is germany or italy cheaper ? 
  oecd comparative price level ( the lower the number the cheaper ) germany : 94 italy : 94 big mac index ( the lower the number the cheaper ) germany : 13 italy : 20 ipad index ( the lower the number the cheaper ) germany : 618,34 $ italy : 674,96 $, 
  [ and thus we have more time playing work simulators . 
  have you ever seen obama waving a tiny flag ? 
  there 's no graceful way to do that . 
  it 's only a source for stupid fotos . 
  man i love the german feierabend mentality . 
  do n't fuck around at work , but leave at five . 
  i 'm pretty sure they will do that . 
  germany also has foreign ngos , also russian ones and they do n't have to proclaim themselves as `` foreign agents '' . 
  i have nothing against russian media in germany and i have nothing against challenging the `` western '' worldview . 
  but rt and other russian media are completely making up stories now , taking scenes of movies and even video games and present it as a factual presentation of europe . 
  just some days ago russian media said merkel made a selfie with one of the brussels terrorists . 
  also there was the whole lena incident that was completely organised by russian media and politicians . 
  to compare it with dw is pretty ridiculous . 
  it is more about debunking certain myths . 
  in the german title it says : viel l\u00e4rm um fast nichts . 
  ( much ado about almost nothing . ), 
  i think noone is suprised about mighty people evading taxes . 
  it is rather the sheer amount of people they have by the balls now which is astonishing and a lot more people we do n't even know about are already sweating . 
  the editor in chief of s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung responded to the lack of united states individuals in the documents , saying to `` just wait for what is coming next '' . 
  this was not the end of the story . 
  it is merely the beginning and i expect much more revelations . 
  they have data for weeks and weeks of new articles every day . 
  they have not even completely evaluated all of the 2,6 tb . 
  [ link to the german newspaper that received the data , did most of the groundwork and decided to share its information with a group of international journalists .

  guido is it you ?

  that 's crazy . 
  every german isis returner i know of gets at least prison for being a member in a terorist organisation . 
  bull, 
  no we have to retribute them every time . 
  / s that 's the vicious circle in the midle east going on for decades . 
  we either break this circle or become a part of it and the same shit will still happen in 50 years . 
  [ islam in belgium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_belgium ) [ islam in france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_france ) [ islam in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_germany ), 
   give it some years and germany will be so as well . 
  germany had muslims coming in since the late 50s . 
  in the 70s germany had around 1,5 million muslims . 
  that is far more than the muslim population of belgium today . 
  even before the beginning of the refugee crisis last year the german muslim population was around 4,5 million , which is more than 5 times the muslim population of belgium . 
  no joke . 
  i have seen that in alanya . 
  russians lying on other people 's towels or throwing the towels in the pool . 
   also , the war . 
  they just like her haircut . 
  of course it was the flag captain obvious . 
  what else would it be ? 
  thx captain obvious .

  numbers of universities per country in the the euro top 200 uk : 46 germany : 36 italy : 19 france : 15 netherlands : 13 sweden : 11 switzerland : 9 denmark : 6 finland : 6 ireland : 6 russia :5 belgium : 5 austria : 5 spain : 5 norway : 4 cyprus :1 czech republic : 1 estonia : 1 greece : 1 iceland : 1 portugal : 1, 
  i can only speak for germany here . 
  almost all german universities do a lot of research . 
  but they have to share parts of the cake with very strong private research-only institutions like max planck gesellschaft , leibniz gemeinschaft , fraunhofer gesellschaft and helmholtz gemeinschaft which are funded by the german government while the universities are funded by the states of germany ( which are not as wealthy ) . 
  edit : in fact if an institute or scientist at a german university is world class / cutting edge in its field it is possible that the german government asks him to build a new max planck / fraunhofer institue around his research field and thus he 's no longer part of the university . 
  i do n't doubt that the uk has a lot of top notch universities . 
  but these rankings will always be biased towards english / american university systems , which will use these rankings as a kind of beauty pageant . 
  differnet organized universities like in germany or france , the lack of the urge to cater to these rankings because of tuition free studying , the fact that almost all this renowned rankings are either english or american and the therefore emerging english speaking citation bias ( often almost all non english research is disregarded ) lead to a strong distortion in the depiction of worldwide university landscape . 
  lower crime rates , better infrastructure ( especially public transport ) , no excessive tipping culture because of fair minimum wages , far lower wealth inequality , public health insurance , free higher education , lower housing and grocery costs ( in germany ) , lower childcare costs . 
  then go to berlin . 
  best nightlife of the three . 
  [ die welt ] ( http://www.welt.de/ ) and [ focus ] ( http://www.focus.de/ ) are rather critical towards the refugee crisis and have at least a little bit of quality . 
  edit : if you want high quality news about germany , you have to look at [ faz ] ( http://www.faz.net/ ) , [ sz ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/ ) and [ zeit ] ( http://www.zeit.de/index ) even if they not always reflect your opinion . 
  seems like someone does n't know what multiculturalism means . 
  for a better comparison : [ royal navy ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vqqufqy6ma4/vgslsjthvdi/aaaaaaaafgs/lg1xcliioym/s1600/royal%2bnavy%2ball.jpg ) [ german bundesmarine ] ( http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/553fe1986da8110831a2755c-1200-1500/ju2lpcz%20-%20imgur.png ), 
  and every big institution in the eu prognosed an incredible increase of refugees for 2015 . 
  even long before germany `` invited '' anyone . 
  to think germany is responsible for the majority of the refugees is just unworldly . 
  our love for rules and order often comes in the way of our efficiency . 
  but having seen dozens of german factories from the inside , i can assure you germans can be very very effective . 
   but the existence of these shelters does n't mean the violent men would avoid punishment . 
  only if there is a complaint , as it would be the same when gay refugees report their abusers to the police . 
  in fact most abusers of women also never get punished , because the abused women either never report their husbands / friends or they withdraw their complaint . 
  i 'm not talking about refugees , but normal women shelters for mistreated women . 
  do n't you have something like that in your country ? 
  there are also women shelters in germany , although it is forbidden to beat your wife / girlfriend . 
  does that also mean germany has lost control ? 
  berlin gets a lot of money and is becomig a stronger economical centre every day , but competition is very strong in germany . 
  the huge advantage germany has is that it is very decentralized and has several wealthy cities . 
  we have a financial centre with frankfurt , the industrial centres are munich / stuttgart and several cities in the rhein / main region . 
  we have a logistics / international trade centre with hamburg .
