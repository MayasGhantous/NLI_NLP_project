  the universal declaration of human rights , article 2, 
  knowingly sending someone in to death is a violation of human rights . 
  then you 're 100 % wrong . 
  refugees normal people ? 
  not possible . 
  shit / r/europe says, 
  translation : let the fuckers drown !, 
  who cares ? 
  it is an exageration . 
  but who cares , after all we 're in / r/europe where every sensationalist comment about how bad moslems are is upvoted . 
  thriving art , music , media , tech , fashion and startup scene and best nightlife in the world . 
  that 's total bullshit . 
  this . 
  what event are you talking about ? 
  the christmas tree, 
  germany is doing exactly this . 
  it 's a trick of the right-wingers to make themselves the victims , the underdogs , the fighters for justice . 
  they dismiss the whole press and media landscape in germany as `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' ( lying press ) . 
  they are making up stories of stealing , raping and murdering refugees . 
  they want to convince the average joe in germany that we are living in a leftist , socialist dictatorhip - a dictatorship that has to be overthrown , therefore they have to play the opressed . 
  unfortunately a lot of people ( including a big part of this sub ) are already dancing to their tune .

  you 're making no sense here, 
  what ? 
  more like still suffering from the mess they caused in 2008 . 
  greece would n't be in such dire straits if they had n't juggled their figures and fooled the eu and their own people . 
  no one urged greece to join the eurozone . 
  i mean there are several other eu nations that do n't have the euro . 
  also you make it sound as if germany is responsible for the greek financial crisis , while it was mainly the usa and their unregulated finance system that brought the economy down . 
  also germany was never the country that wanted the euro the most . 
  they were totally fine with the extremely strong d-mark . 
  france wanted the euro in order to keep the german economy in check . 
  remember when nazis killed 12 people and injured more than 200 during oktoberfest . 
  remember when hundreds of nazis besieged refugee homes in rostock lichtenahgen and hoyerswerda throwing molotow cocktails and stones into the windows without being bothered by the police for 3 days ? 
  remember when a gang of nazis ( called nsu ) roamed around germany for years killing turkish people and planning bombings ? 
  remember when nazis killed a turkish family of 5 through an arson attack in solingen ? 
  or remember another arson attack in schwarndorf where 4 turks died ? 
  remember when a nazi stabbed the designated mayor of cologne in the neck ? 
  remember when a nazi killed a foreign looking bookseller and a policeman with a pumpgun ? 
  remember when a nazi killed 3 female police officers ? 
  there were 75 dead through right-wing terrorism in germany between 1990 and 2015 . 
  while there were 2 dead ( both american soldiers ) through islamistic terrorism in the same timespan . 
  also for germany . 
  thanks . 
  maybe talk to the refugees how inhuman they are treated in germany in comparison to pretty much every other country they passed . 
  thanks merkel . 
  to what ? 
  you 're right . 
  i will edit it .

  apparently there were 13.131 succesful deportations from january till july 2016 . 
  this is not what the article says . 
  of course it is a bmw . 
  good, 
   everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . 
  the universal declaration of human rights article 14 ( 1 ), 
  seems like you are not aware of it then . 
  let me tell you how to read this . 
  this only tells you how much patents were filed in the national offices . 
  so if a german invents something he will probably submit an application in germany , europe , the usa and maybe china to have it protected everywhere in the world . 
  i doubt that an us inventor will submit it in the german office but in the european , if at all . 
  this only tells you that the us is a big market for patents but not who submitted the applications and from which country they were . 
  if you want to know how many patents per capita are submitted by nationality you have to look at the world intellectual property indicator . 
  and when we look at that germans have a higher wipi per capita and per gdp than americans . 
  it 's even in your posted link on page 28 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_intellectual_property_indicators also nice change of subject . 
  edit : wrong link, 
  http://www.dekra-solutions.com/2016/07/01/autonomous-driving-germany-has-registered-the-most-patents/?lang=en do you sound arrogant on purpose or is it something you are not aware of ? 
  1.646 of 2.838 patents of selfdriving car technology patents worldwide are in the hands of german companies . 
  tesla does n't own any patents anymore and google and apple together only have 202 . 
  second place are japanese companies . 
  source : http://www.dekra-solutions.com/2016/06/21/autonomes-fahren-deutschland-mit-den-meisten-patenten/ also regarding aviation , ever heard of airbus , rolls royce , mtu aerodynamics , leonardo-finmeccanica , thales , safran , bae systems , dassault aviation ? 
  most patents on self driving technology are owned by german companies . 
  dude , i 'm german i know what l\u00fcgenpresse is . 
   i do n't think you could make it look any worse if you tried . 
  the commenters i answered to sure managed to make it look a lot worse , claiming only 150 or 68 of more than 1 million are employed . 
  untill june 2016 there still were hundred thousands of people that just are n't allowed to work . 
  for afd voters every election is `` bundestagswahl '' . 
  around 80 % of the people voted for center / center-left / left / liberal parties and afd is fifth . 
  just one week before , afd only got 7,8 % in elections in lower saxony , not really a majority in any way . 
  as always with the refugees , a small minority of idiots spoil it for everyone else . 
  do as you like . 
  and i guess you are the one that knows it all , because you read stuff on the internet . 
  enlighten me !, 
  but if google translate is right the interviewed says 50 % of all refugees have jobs after 8 years . 
  this is ridiculous !, 
  there 's no sense in answering someone that is clearly wanting . 
  how old are you ? 
  500 years ? 
  i did n't invite anyone . 
  independant of what i think about merkel 's refugee policy i 'm a guy that thinks if they are already here we have to help them instead of ignoring them and showing them the could shoulder . 
  i mean if you want them to integrate quickly you have to help them with that . 
  if you want to loose your fears about them you have to get to know them . 
  not if generalizing means 50 % = 0 % . 
   i 'm speaking in generalities that 's the problem of the majority of commenters in here . 
  yeah , that 's bullshit . 
  and in germany . 
  i 'm just stating the official numbers , instead of pulling something out of my ass . 
  noone says this is a success . 
  but considering the conditions this is not as bad as some people in here make it look .
