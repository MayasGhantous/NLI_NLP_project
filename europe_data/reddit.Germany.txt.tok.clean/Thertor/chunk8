  but an islamic terrorist that killed himself ? 
  these guys want to be martyrers and killing himself is ticket to hell and not to paradise . 
  so the eu should fly to the moon in the end ? 
  what does recent and small minority mean ? 
  between 1950 and 2005 around 2,5 million germans from the former soviet union emigrated to germany with the mid-ninenties being the strongest years ( several years with more than 200.000 migrants each ) . 
  plus since the 1980s around 1,5 million ethnically germans from poland , 500.000 germans from romania , 150.000 from czech republic and 100.000 from yugoslavia emigrated to germany . 
  [ maybe a little bit ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/earningslabourcosts/realearningsnetearnings/tables/tables_indexofrealearnings.html;jsessionid=0b3a48559217f33bb2b1672b8c52ce71.cae2 ), 
  no it 's not . 
  in 2014 and 2015 germany had the highest increase of real earnings for decades . 
  and by now it looks like 2016 will continue this trend . 
  no einstein and goethe ? 
  we have a winner here . 
  denial of holocaust , incitemnet to murder , rape , discrimination has been a crime in the federal republic of germany and was always punished . 
  these posts were not criticising merkel or germany 's policy but incite to kill , rape or hurt people ( mostly refugees , sometimes even with photos , addresses and names ) . 
  except for 1994 , 2009 , 2012 , 2013 and 2014 . 
  in germany it is called the battle of tannenberg ( not to be mistaken with battle of tannenberg in 1914 ) . 
  fun fact : [ this is the current grand master of the teutonic order .

   invest in infrastructure all you want it means nothing if they destroy it all . 
  the broken window theory says otherwise . 
  huh ? 
  where are you living ? 
  we are doing that since 2001 . 
  the only thing we ( especially usa ) achieved is more terrorists . 
  if you would apply the broken window theory you should rather advocate for more infrastructure investment in banlieues , more state funded social and youth facilities to rival the mosques , more streetworkers and a job campaign for the youth . 
  precision strikes on what ? 
  so we have nuclear attacks , internment camps , forced relocation , collective punishement , militarisation of police forces . 
  and nothing of your measures would have prevented this attack . 
  plus terrorists are n't afraid of big weapons and punishments . 
  they are willing to die and they have the advantage of suprise . 
  you could beef up the police force to millions and equip them like an army . 
  you still could ` nt prevent the attacks . 
  big demand in germany . 
  also one of the highest paid positions in the industry . 
  of course not . 
  the title makes it seem like they were sold to germany like slaves . 
  but instead german romanians wanted to leave romania and germany paid money for them to leave and live in germany . 
  more like one third uk and 2 thirds german . 
  there are almost twice as many tourists from germany than from uk visiting mallorca every year . 
  i think it has something to do with the 350.000 refugees we took in during the yugoslav wars and the support germany gave them during their fight for independence . 
  wow . 
  i just searched for engineering jobs in material science on a german job site and i had more than 500 results . 
  and the biggest job site in germany has more than 1.3 million ads at the moment ( if i counted correctly ) . 
  what is a macedonia ? 
  execute order 66 !, 
  if even the israelis are backing us , maybe it is really time . 
  you forgot / s. 
  a capital that was divided for 40 years and lost the majority of its companies because of that . 
  in the last 8 years some rather big players have emerged from the scene : babbel.com : with 20 million users it 's the second biggest online language service in the world after duolingo . 
  ( around 300 employees ) soundcloud.com : with more than 175 million unique users per month the biggest sound sharing portal in the world . 
  ( around 300 employees ) researchgate.com : with more than 10 million users the biggest scientific network in the world and the second most visited scientific service after google scholar . 
  it is estimated that more than 60 % of all scientists have a profile at researchgate . 
  ( around 250 employees ) deliveryhero.com : with more than 200.000 partner restaurants and 15 million online orders it 's the biggest online food delivery service in the world . 
  ( more than 2500 employees ) zalando.com : the biggest online fashion store in europe . 
  ( more than 10.000 employees ) then there are a lot of other fast-growing startups from berlin like number26.com , dubsmash.com , foodpanda.com , pexels.com , hem.com , dawanda.com , kleiderkreisel.com , junique.com , lovoo.com , bookatiger.com , ormigo.com , quandoo.com , outfittery.com , helloclue.com , hellofresh.com , eyeem.com , iversity.org , gobutler.com , onefootball.com , memorado.com , dataconomy.com , careerfoundry.com , telegram.org , hitfox.com , azubu.tv , blinkist.com , adjust.com , zenmate.com , editionf.com , lesara.com , auctionata.com , mobile.de , immobilienscout24.com , bonativo.com , moviepilot.de , blacklane.com , jodel-app . com , sharethemeal.com , rebuy.com , modomoto.com , goeuro.com , my-hammer . de and many many more . 
  what do you expect to see ? 
  in 2012 there were around 6.500 people working in berlin startups . 
  four years later more than 30.000 people are working in the berlin startup scene and it is expected to hit the 50.000 in the next 3 years . 
  no other city has this kind of growing rates . 
  if the berlin startup scene would be one big employer , it already would be the biggest one in the city . 
  it would n't be that if all the companies that were founded and based in berlin ( e.g. 
  lufthansa , deutsche bank , siemens , edeka , aeg , knorr-bremse , commerzbank , allianz , osram etc. ), 
  did n't relocate to frankurt , hamburg or munich . 
  berlin is by far the biggest startup hub in germany . 
  last year more startup venture capital was invested in berlin than in london . 
  every 5 hours one new startup is founded in berlin . 
  berlin has by far the most new company foundations in germany and was voted the best city in germany to start a business by entrepreneurs . 
  in the last 10 years around 400.000 new jobs were created . 
  several statistics show that berlin is the fastest growing startup and tech city in the world . 
  with wista in adlershof berlin has by far the biggest tech and science park in germany and one of the biggest in europe , which will even grow much stronger in the next years , because of several companies locating there . 
  at the day of brexit 5 london tech startups declared to move to berlin and it is expected that dozens will follow . 
  deutsche bank in london said to relocate the most of their fintech department ( around 8000 employees ) to berlin . 
  with the brexit in sight it 's probably not a question of if but only when berlin will be the unchallenged startup and tech capital of europe . 
  you 're the 6th biggest now . 
  france is the 5th and germany is the 4th . 
  ranking : 1 . 
  ** berlin ** 3 . 
  melbourne 7 . 
  sydney 9 . 
  ** madrid ** 15 . 
  ** lisbon ** 17 . 
  singapore 21 . 
  honolulu 24 . 
  portland 25 . 
  germany overall was the better team ( except for goals ) . 
  but pretty much shot itself in the foot with a dumb hand penalty plus it had a lot of bad luck with chances , ref calls ( hummels ' suspension ) and injuries ( gomez , khedira , boateng ) . 
  nevertheless france played very disciplined and used its chances much more crucially than we did . 
  so congratulations france . 
  i will root for you in the finals . 
  according to wikipedia it is only 47cm higher than the [ berlin tv tower . 
  ] ( http://www.hdwallpaperseek.com/coder/upload_folder/berlin-tv-tower-at-night-t4.jpg ) well played latvia . 
  i agree . 
  the commerzbank tower is a terrible example of modern and beautiful skyscraper architecture , typical 90s . 
  would be funny if all [ big 4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_four_accounting_firms ) would be located in them . 
  i definitely can see the pwc logo . 
  the commerzbank tower was completed in 1997 and took the title `` tallest building in europe '' from the only 2m shorter [ messeturm ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/frankfurt_am_main_messeturm.jpg ) in frankfurt . 
  2003 the tower lost the title to the triumph palace in moscow . 
  as the name says the headquarters of the german bank `` commerzbank '' are located in the tower . 
  the antenna gives the tower a total hight of 300m . 
  a marvelous display of an absolute lack of knowledge .
