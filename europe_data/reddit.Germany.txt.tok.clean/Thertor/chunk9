  well done . 
  london as headquarters will be the most unlikely now . 
  it 's either frankfurt or the deal is cancelled . 
  why form the biggest stock exchange in europe with the eu market as their main target when the headquarter is outside of the eu market ? 
  there are just too many hurdles . 
  they are at 6-7 % ( need 5 % to enter ) right now . 
  you know that google , yahoo , microsoft , apple , amazon and ebay were all startups once ? 
  this was always a scarcely populated part of the country . 
   extremely unlikely . 
  negotiations would have to restart . 
  the agreement would be void . 
  not at all . 
  it was already known since may that the question of the location of the headquarters will be reviewed in case of a brexit . 
   do you realise that the deutsche bank - lse merger will feature london as the headquarters you probably mean the merger of the deutsche b\u00d6rse and london stock exchange . 
  then you probably also know that since the brexit the german shareholders of deutsche b\u00f6rse and the german banking supervisor are very sceptical about moving the headquarters to london and because of that it is very likely that the deal could be cancelled or that the headquarters will be in frankfurt . 
  yeah right , 
  5 startups only on brexit day . 
  a lot of startups will leave london , the only question is where . 
  berlin is one of the top contenders for them . 
  also after brexit london 's deutsche bank boss john cryan already announced he will move a big part of his fintech branch ( at least 8000 employees ) to either frankfurt or berlin . 
  [ first london startups planning move to berlin : on the day of brexit 5 london startups were already announcing their move to berlin and more are expected to follow ( german article ) ] ( http://m.morgenpost.de/berlin/article207732239/erste-londoner-start-ups-wollen-nach-berlin-umziehen.html ), 
  finance to frankfurt and startups to berlin . 
  start with duolingo . 
  it 's free and pretty good to get into the language . 
  i think an associate degree will be not enough to get a good it job in germany . 
  if you already have a lot of job experience in it this would be another story . 
  otherwise you could apply for an it study program at a german university ( there are several ones in english ) or if you do n't meet the requirements to study in germany or you do n't have the finacial support the mobipro programme is a very good alternative , which also enables you to study in germany afterwards . 
  with your education the trade `` fachinformatiker f\u00fcr systeminegration '' ( it specialist for system integration ) comes to mind . 
  what 's your specialization ? 
  also you can get by with english , but i advice everyone that wants to work in germany to learn german now . 
  if you are younger and you do n't have lots of job experience have a look into this [ programme ] ( https://www.thejobofmylife.de/en/home.html ) . 
  you get german courses , a dual vocational education in a trade of your choice ( several hundred careers are available , with a very good chance to continue your path in germany after graduation ) and you get paid from day one ( 818 $ per month , after graduation your salary will probably double or even tripple ) . 
  the german dual vocational education is standardised , very practice-oriented ( because you work in a company from day 1 ) and is very well respected in germany and abroad . 
  the majority of the german population did this kind of training . 
  germany is expected to grow at least 10 more years and will very likely reach more than 85 million people . 
  everything after that time span is pure speculation . 
  germany 's birthrate is increasing for 5 years in a row now and the prognosis for germany is based on the 2014 birthrate while the 2015 and 2016 birthrate most likely will be higher as well . 
   we still have the lowest birth rate in the world , do n't we ? 
  no we do n't . 
   besides , can you post statistics about the share of births in germany sorted by ethnicity ? 
  i ca n't because noone distinguishes between native germans and germans with migration background or migrants . 
  but east germany has a significantly higher birthrate than west germany , although the share of migrants and especially muslim / arabic migrants is much lower . 
  oh boy , birth rates are increasing for 5 years now and they are expected to continue rising . 
  and that is not only because of all the migrants , that pretty much have the same birthrates like germans after one generation . 
  you know that switzerland and usa have more migrants per capita than germany , do you ? 
  also , especially swiss people are very sceptical regarding germans emigrating to switzerland . 
  in the end you will become , what you are complaining about . 
   especially when members in the east historically afraid of german domination come on it 's 2016 . 
  what the fuck ? 
  always had the impression germany would be cheaper than the netherlands . 
  lots of dutch people cross the border for shopping . 
  france 2 . 
  netherlands 4 . 
  great britain / poland / czechia / sweden / italy, 
  it 's in german though : http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/76095/umfrage/asylantraege-insgesamt-in-deutschland-seit-1995/ http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/154287/umfrage/hauptherkunftslaender-von-asylbewerbern/ http://www.migration-info.de/artikel/2014-09-04/europa-ungleiche-verteilung-asylsuchenden in 2013 for example one quarter of all asylum applications ( 126,705 ) in europe were filed in germany and therefore it is / was leading europe by far with most asylum applicants ( second was france with 64,740 and third was sweden with 54,270 ) , while italy ( the southern european country with the most refugees by far ) had 27,930 applicants . 
  every year since the 90s germany has taken in much more refugees than all of southern europe ( and also eastern europe ) combined , not to mention the hundred thousands to over a million of economic / work migrants that enter germany every year ( germany has 16,3 million people with migration background ) . 
  saying germany has no experience with refugees and migrants or they are something new here could n't be further away from the truth . 
  iran , pakistan , eritrea , syria , afghanistan , russia , irak , nigeria , vietnam , sudan , ethiopia etc. , etc. . germany has had more refugee aplications per capita than any southern european country ( except malta ) for years and by far the most in europe in total numbers . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  germany is taking in huge amounts of refugees for decades . 
  also germany has the most migrants in the whole world after the usa ( even before the recent refugee crisis ) . 
   the city is a mess nowadays even worse than it ever has been in which way ? 
  definitely yes . 
  according to [ the mercer quality of life index 2016 ] ( http://www.mercer.com/newsroom/western-european-cities-top-quality-of-living-ranking-mercer.html ) , which is explicitly aimed at expats , d\u00fcsseldorf is in the top ten of the most liveable cities in the world ( 6th place ) . 
  d\u00fcsseldorf also ranks 2nd in germany 's citizen 's satisfactory rankings and it comes in first in germany 's citizen friendliness rankings . 
  it has around 100,000 people more than manchester . 
  d\u00fcsseldorf is the richest city in the whole region . 
  it 's one of germany 's financial , economical , arts and media centres and together with cologne it is the centre of the rhine-ruhr region with around 12 million people . 
  it 's great for shopping ( [ k\u00f6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6nigsallee ) ) and going out ( d\u00fcsseldorf 's old town is also called longest bar in the world ) . 
  d\u00fcsseldorf also has a lot of art galleries , museums , parks , gardens and theatres . 
  and if that 's not enough , within 20 minutes you can reach cologne which is even bigger than d\u00fcsseldorf and also very vibrant . 
  but be careful , there 's a big rivalry between cologne and d\u00fcsseldorf ( never order a d\u00fcsseldorfer alt beer in cologne ) . 
  salaries in the rhineland seem to be slightly above average , especially in cities like d\u00fcsseldorf and cologne . 
  rents can differ a lot in the rhineland . 
  cologne and d\u00fcsseldorf are rather pricy , but still cheaper than munich or frankfurt . 
  but there are smaller cities and towns with really low rents , but with really big and well paying companies ( leverkusen comes to mind ) . 
  you would have probably a little bit more money after rent in cologne than in munich . 
  but in the end the difference is probably neglectable . 
  munich ( 112 % of the average salary ) , frankfurt ( 108 % ) , stuttgart ( 108 % ) and hamburg ( 106 % ) . 
  but these are also some of the cities with the highest rents in germany . 
  so in the end you wo n't have much more to spend than in other regions ( at least not as a beginner ) . 
  web developers in germany get an average starting salary of 38,000 $ - 45,000 $ per year which would be 2,000 $ - 2,300 $ after taxes ( no children , not married , not in church ) . 
  after 5 years the average salary is 45,000 $ - 55,000 $ ( 2,450 $ - 2,750 $ ) . 
  after more than 10 years the average salary is 65,000 $ - 80,000 $ ( 3,120 $ - 3,800 $ ) . 
  in general it jobs are a little bit underpaid ( although the demand is very strong ) and this is not the most lucrative branch . 
  the most lucrative job ( excluding something like investment banker ) is probably chemical engineer in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry with average starting salaries of 55,000 $ - 63.000 $ ( 2,750 $ - 3,050 $ ) . 
  after 5 years 68,000 $ - 80,000 $ ( 3,250 $ - 3,800 $ ) and after 10 years 85,000 $ - 112,000 $ ( 4,000 $ - 5,250 $ ) . 
  which does n't mean that much . 
  per capita or per gdp would be much more adequate . 
  the dutch for example have paid $ 804,29 per person ( 1,57 % of their gdp ) or the swedes have paid $ 918,83 per person ( also 1,57 % of their gdp ) , while the uk only paid $ 496,07 per capita ( 1,09 % of their gdp ) . 
  even the french paid more per capita ( $ 540,27 ) and per gdp ( 1,26 % ) . 
  also italy pays more per gdp than the uk ( 1,12 % ) despite their economy being stagnant for years . 
  that 's because the uk gets a discount since 1984 . 
  still the uk regularly thinks their part is too big and does n't want to pay the whole amount . 
  there are 8 countries in the eu that pay more per capita than the uk . 
  still they do n't make such a big fuss about it . 
  bells for romania, 
  that is absolutely not true . 
  since january photos and fingerprints are taken and alot of other information . 
  everything will be saved in a national identification system and every refugee gets an id card which is handled like a german ausweis .
