  edit : you might be able to say that fast was the precursor to bing . 
  i have to ask myself if i actually know anybody who would report an * unwanted * peck on the cheek to police . 
  i 'm trying to think of any friends or family and ca n't think of one , but i may be wrong . 
  i do n't think i am though . 
  actual rape on the other hand and i 'd say most would . 
  i share your sentiment . 
  i 'll be in greece tomorrow and it kills me to see what is happening there . 
  you 're correct . 
  civil unions are recognised in cyprus too . 
  i agree that it seems rather frivolous . 
  what bugs me is the fact they can withdraw parliamentary immunity by a simple majority vote ? 
  it seems like a slippery slope and downright hostile towards opposing viewpoints . 
  i 'm wondering whether a member of epp or s&d would get the same treatment in similar circumstances . 
  yes . 
  which is why i 'd disagree with you labelling greeks as lazy . 
  probably one of the best points in this entire thread . 
  cheers . 
  oh really ? 
  strange when you consider both are in a military alliance called nato . 
  makes you wonder . 
  fraud and corruption is never fair play . 
  that was going through my mind . 
  i 'd imagine some are dual citizens that may be able to travel on alternative passports . 
  does anybody know how that would work on exit control ? 
  well , if it is a country whose best tv program is as bad as * tatort * ... 
  he was from braunau am inn . 
  that 's in austria . 
  it is nonsense and yes . 
  i 've also spoken to a franco-ontarian beside a quebecer just a month ago  my francophone friends from nova scotia also have unique vocabulary . 
  eurusd is n't looking too hot either . 
  we 're seeing 15-year lows versus the greenback here in the euro area . 
  but regardless , using purely exchange rates as economic indicators is amateur and unhelpful . 
  using interest rates is probably a slightly better indicator of economic health . 
  neither paint a worthwhile picture without much , much more data . 
  well it 's actually the brits and americans and other allies that did away with your royalty . 
   the euro before the euro comparing physical gold to fractional reserve fiat . 
  i dislike `` hate speech '' as much as anybody else , but no , banning it would make a * democratic * country * undemocratic * . 
  it pisses me off about germany . 
  i think holocaust deniers should be allowed to outcast themselves in civil society . 
   canada has a population of around 30m ~ 36m  is not exactly a power house in any business field other than in those specifically tailored to supply the us market if the vast natural resources , that europe does not possess , are only useful to the us ... meh . 
  based on your german username , i might bet that whatever city is closest , it 's served by public transport vehicles built ( at least in part ) by bombardier ( the trams , the metros , ice trains , s-bahn ) . 
   ceta is economically insignificant for the eu until you actually look at the text contained within . 
   i do n't care enough to read the article and find out why it is wrong which seems to be within the spirit of your entire opinion . 
  but it 's the independent , so i ca n't fault you at least not for bothering to read the entire article . 
   forged the afd exactly . 
  now let 's not forget also that the fp\u00d6 almost secured victory in austria , marine le pen got to the final round in france and the pvv are n't doing so bad in the netherlands . 
  or that the second largest net contributor to the eu is leaving . 
  it 's like reality is an alien concept around here sometimes . 
  germany will not be participating , i agree . 
  wait until the upcoming german elections are over with and the debt crises become a topic once again . 
   times are changing and there is no guarantee that the dollar will remain the reserve currency forever . 
  maybe not forever but for all of our lifetimes . 
  the us is the world 's only superpower and nobody even comes close to matching their military might . 
  there 's no chance ever that the euro becomes the world 's reserve currency , with or without ` eurobonds ' or a federalised eu . 
   there are a lot more trade between france and germany than with the uk who 's debating trade ? 
  you were talking about shared values and i quoted you verbatim . 
   wtf are you talking about ? 
  i 'm not a mind reader here 's a hint : a few years before the creation of the ecsc . 
  unless the french government in exile shared values with the government in berlin at the time ? 
   the eu always been an germano-french thing with the uk first trying to sabotage it from outside then from inside . 
  sounds like the type of tripe you 'd hear from east germany when they were all paranoid . 
  either way , it was advantageous for close trading between historic enemies in order to prevent more war . 
   bold claim without any substance . 
  you dislike the current governments of poland and hungary so you 'd rather chuck them out of the club so countries you actually like get more in funding . 
  that sounds like nothing like cooperation and friendship among european peoples . 
   the whole eastern enlargement was a mistake . 
  and so was the uk admission . 
  there is no point of a huge union if people do not share the same values hence goals . 
  you 're quite far off there . 
  germany and france have much less in common than germany and the uk , so this idea that all countries in the original european coal and steel community were so similar is bunk . 
  and please , the netherlands and france ? 
  odd that just a few years before that was when the uk and france `` shared the same values '' . 
  the rest of that post sounds ridiculous and completely counter to what the eu should stand for . 
  it does matter . 
  the welfare state is essentially a contract between its citizens/residents and the state ; an insurance policy if you will . 
  you have no moral or legal right to that welfare net if you 're a newly arrived illegal migrant . 
  hmm . 
  i 've heard that type of rhetoric from germany before . 
  false . 
  the idea of brexit has existed for decades . 
  it 's only now that it 's happening are people opening their eyes and consequently probably a contributing factor to brexit : the naysayers had been ignored for far too long . 
  they 're doctors and lawyers mate / s, 
  really sums up my feelings better than i could . 
  friendship , partnership and cooperation and not a european superstate . 
   according to the geneva convention , all signatories to it have to help the unhcr to share the burden of taking care of refugees and in executing its duties . 
  and which of the geneva convention ** s ** are you referring to ? 
  at least the convention relating to the status of refugees in its second article , states that the refugees must abide by national laws . 
  this has not been fulfilled . 
  anyways , contrary to what you are calling them ( refugees ) , any that arrived by land are not legally refugees and are not treated as such by the law . 
  does n't matter what zdf , ard or any other news organisation is calling them . 
  the whole entire population of this subreddit could state they are refugees and it would n't change german law . 
  i refer you to article 16a of the german constitution . 
  and even if i agreed with you on providing assistance to syrians , which i do in some cases , they make up a minority of the illegal immigrants in germany . 
  the burden of proof is on you . 
  there are no direct commercial flights between syria and germany . 
  virtually every other country with commercial aviation links is considered a safe third country ** by law ** . 
  if you happen to have any other form of transportation in mind , then i refer you to article 16a , paragraph ii of the german constitution ( * grundgesetz * ) , the supreme law of the land . 
  if you enter germany or the schengen area without presenting yourself to the relevant immigration authorities , you are breaking the law . 
  so millions of illegal migrants cross a dozen countries while employing human traffickers on the way . 
  virtually all of the ones in germany are guilty of that .
