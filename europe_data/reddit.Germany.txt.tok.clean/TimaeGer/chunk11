  i think we should somehow revive bismarck and call it magna germania . 
  can we send merkel ? 
  there are tons of posts of people moving to germany on / r/germany . 
  i think you will find everything you want to know there , 
  that 's true . 
  thanks , 
  i would say with both . 
  there is no way she is doing it faster just because she ca n't watch her show in brussels . 
  seriously guys , you should n't think that bad about politicians . 
   25 percent of ** new ** police officers hired, 
  which nation is in greece ? 
  edit : hey guys i searched a bit on wikipedia . 
  i might be wrong but i think it 's albania . 
  good joke . 
  the stuff your government does has nothing to do with european values . 
  lol at spain and portugal . 
  `` do n't mind us , we just got a bit of the atlantic . 
  nothing to see here '', 
   ** myth **  ttip would allow powerful us firms to sue governments at will . 
  nice , it 's not true . 
   if the tribunal decides the government has [ treated them unfairly ] , it can make it pay compensation . 
  why is / r/germany the only country sub speaking english ? 
  i always want to check what 's going on in other eu countries :(, 
  there are just many rich people in moscow . 
  fucking switzerland . 
  they ruin the map of europe . 
  good work northern germany . 
  out of curiosity , what opinions do u.s. citizens have regarding ttip ? 
  why does a lithuanian call it k\u00f6nigsberg ? 
  for the sake of ordnung . 
  yeah , that 's what it says in german . 
  i do n't really know what bild wanted to say but ` teuer sein ' mainly translates into being important and liked . 
  of course it 's possible they wanted to say greeks are expensive . 
  what does it say in greek ? 
  wait the left party wants to be like the german government which does mainly centre-right stuff ? 
  maybe more people should speak german . 
  seems to come with free money . 
  depends on your ideology . 
  speaking of propaganda ... 
  efficiency fuck yeah !, 
  but it seems that austria was on its own for to long ? 
  it 's stuttgard, 
  after beethoven they even got the world thinking porsche is austrian ? 
  i do n't think you wanted to answer me but it 's really hard to understand austrians as a german who is not used to listen to them . 
  you get used to it tho . 
  also , every austrian i have talked to ( mainly ~ 20 years old ) can speak standard german and the difference is n't that big in my experience . 
  what is this \u00e5 thing ? 
  oops . 
  i read what thing they did bring . 
  ~ ~ shisha ~ ~ missed the wish part . 
  shisha is pretty big in germany . 
  [ but netherlands does n't seem to mind !,

  yeah , but belgium always looks like this . 
  every time i see maps like this i wonder why belgium is a thing . 
  a newer one : cities skylines . 
  you just ca n't stop . 
  i bet they told him this was for a video game . 
  i would be so hyped up to play the mission after this intro . 
  hey we had it too, 
  nah there is a good bunch of awesome photos of landscapes , cities and european traditions . 
  see ? 
  good thing we do n't ally with italy . 
  these crazy people thinking about invading russia . 
  that only proofs the point of needing an eu military . 
  you seem to forget that america is on the other side of an ocean and russia just a few hundred kilometers away . 
  economically russia and europe is more connected than europe and the us . 
  it never ended . 
  many russians are still friendly to germans and vice versa . 
  wouldnt say culturally . 
  russia and germany had a long friendly history before wwi edit : also , germany is economically more aligned with the us than russia ? 
  i must have missed all the natural resources in germany and these we are importing from america . 
  you easily can tell this one is fake because there is one building in the background not fully grey . 
  russia loves grey .

  what scares me that people here in reddit are really military friendly . 
  i hope this is just due the young age and they will get less war enthusiastic as they get older .

  every time i see pictures of slovakia i 'm totally stunned . 
  then i think : you probably can takes these nice pictures of every country . 
  but then again , i have never seen anything like that from germany :(, 
  lets see how fast we can make k\u00f6nigsberg look good again . 
   it 's a nice strawman you have there . 
   i care more about estonians because they are my ethnic group wow, 
   it 's not about making a patch of land prosperous , goal is to keep alive the culture and way of life of people that call that patch of land home . 
  no it is n't . 
  do you really believe all germans have the same way of live ? 
  have the same culture ? 
  like this culture ? 
  like the same things ? 
  do you really thing no other people than germans like the `` german culture '' ? 
  also , cultures change all the time . 
  this is a good thing . 
  we are n't free to do whatever the fuck we want because we preserved our culture . 
  maybe you should visit some places and talk to different people so you realise there are people you like and do n't like , people you have things in common with and not in common with , regardless of the nationality . 
  why would you care more about all estonians ? 
  there is nothing more to them than being born in the same region and speaking the same language .
