  it 's so embarrassing that most of europe is so xenophobic they would rather have people die in civil wars or drown in the mediterranean than having a few foreign people live beside them . 
  are there really controls between germany and the netherlands ? 
  i thought these controls are just towards the south east . 
  i do n't think pawel kuczynksi is anti eu . 
  it probably would if we won the war and nazi germany slowly broke up like the soviet union did . 
  disallowed content : image macros , memes , reaction gifs and similar low-effort content can we stop it already ? 
  well , at least he should n't complain how no one ever elected him . 
  how is immigration even an anti eu argument . 
  britain has an opt out and these thousands of people sitting in calais are a clear sign that you can protect your borders . 
  haha, 
  i think they are more worried about all the nazis that are coming out now . 
  they stopped because people did n't like the music and complained . 
  have you seen that building ? 
  i would want to work there , too . 
  and [ this ] ( https://onderdonk1.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/vlcsnap-2015-01-23-00h24m13s137.png ), 
  what a pointless article . 
  but it 's 16 minutes long ... 
  our empire is n't listening :(, 
  german even has some sort of rhyme in it , why you hating :(, 
   canto ostinato ` ligconcert \u2122 by sandra & jeroen van veen that 's really good , thanks for sharing . 
  have fun telling turkey to uphold the human rights and take all the refugees when europe does n't take a single refugee . 
  [ here is the spotify link ] ( https://open.spotify.com/track/7zet8ynwm2bziqcblmc3kr ) . 
  i think it 's kind of cool . 
  is the ue used in english to write \u00fc ? 
  a bit of everything i guess ? 
  oh man this sub is going to be so disappointed when everything is sorted out without a big coup , riots or merkel resigning . 
  that 's normal to you . 
  what is normal ? 
  what are you expecting her to do ? 
  the only things she has direct power of is closing the german border completely , what would be really devastating for greece and the eu , or send german military to greece , what she actually did through the nato . 
  i think she is doing the most out of any leaders in europe to solve the crisis . 
  she constantly works towards a european solution , she makes deals with turkey so they reduce the amount of refugees coming through ( what you somehow do n't account to her work ) , she got nato ships to greece . 
  if you actually would look up the facts , the amount of refugees decreased in the last months , and not because the balkans decided to control their borders 3 days ago . 
  oh well i guess it 's boring to follow facts and logic , much more exiting to believe in completely incompetent leaders or conspiracy theories !, 
  no she did n't , that was the result of an ongoing law chance to let people who came here as children , grew up here and actually are more german than any other nationality stay in germany . 
  so the cdu would end up with less influence , shifting the power further left to the spd ? 
  yeah that would certainly get us harder immigration policies . 
  no that 's not what merkel wants . 
  she wants peace in the middle east so there is no need to take refugees and i do n't think you can argue her inactions prior the crisis are a sign of wanting refugees . 
  by that logic at least 90 % of the world should want refugees . 
  she also wants deport migrants with denied asylum requests . 
  did you already forget [ this ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/angela-merkel-comforts-teenage-palestinian-asylum-seeker-germany ) ? 
  of course no one wants a excessive amount of refugees and no one actually tries to bring in a excessive amount of refugees . 
  that question is pretty pointless . 
  also i agree that the word `` fair '' wa n't the best for this question , but please do n't act like people actually answered yes because they do n't want refugees and think fair means no refugees . 
  every one knows what they meant with `` fair '' . 
  for those who think fair means taking no refugees it would n't make any sense to say they want a fair solution , because this is going to support the distribution of refugees , what the poll heavily implies with `` fair '' . 
  [ does n't seem so to me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/461kok/euwide_poll_by_bertelsmannstiftung_finds_87_want/ ), 
  closing borders and saying fuck you to greece is n't a european solution . 
  i wish they come up with english subtitles for the show . 
  a lot of people , not only in germany , should hear what merkel says and her reasoning behind it . 
  the simple headline `` merkel insists no change of course on migrant crisis '' really does n't represent her opinion , especially as a lot of people think she wants to have refugees in germany and europe . 
  what do you mean ? 
  reval right ? 
  this sub does n't believe official reports from the german police , but when a random throwaway account posts a negative story about a middle eastern guy , `` pc police '' and fear of being called racist every one is on board . 
  * nice *, 
  that guy survived an assassination attempt ... 
  or the ones who argue with police officers . 
  how can the swiss society even work with people like this ? 
  i think it 's a better solution than letting greece have them all . 
  fair enough , seems like i misunderstood your first post . 
  in germany we have the '' [ k\u00f6nigsteiner schl\u00fcssel ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6nigsteiner_schl%c3%bcssel ) '' ( sorry only in german ) that takes into account the tax revenue and population of each state to have a fair distribution . 
  we could use a similar thing for the whole eu and have refugees claim asylum in the eu , not a single country . 
  yeah , but that rules is stupid as fuck , we should have a fair system . 
  alright , [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_time_asylum_applicants,_eu-28,_january_2014_%e2%80%93_september_2015.png ) is a graph that shows the number of first time asylum applications in the eu . 
  germany suspended the dublin rules on 25.8.2015 , see [ here ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germany-suspends-dublin-rules-for-syrians/a-18671698 ) . 
  i do n't see how merkels `` invitation '' increased the number of refugees . 
  who cares in what eu nation they want to stay ? 
  only give them benefits while they are in the country they are supposed to be . 
  i 'm pretty sure a distribution quota will come with eu money to provide the refugees . 
  why even look at facts if you just can repeat the same lie over and over again on social media so enough people start believing it ? 
  i hate this cheap argument that just covers your unwillingness to have some foreigners live besides you . 
  you do n't care if there are a million in greece , you do n't care about several millions in turkey , lebanon and jordan , you do n't care if they drown in the mediterranean or die in syria , but god forbid we force them to stay in bulgaria against their will !, 
  well , the real increase of refugees only started in july last year . 
  this gets upvotes . 
  what the fuck r/europe, 
  hungary agreed on giving up some of their national sovereignty when they joined the eu . 
   the western world one article, 
   which is retarded , there is no right to a monopoly which is pretty funny , because a monopoly is kind of desirable . 
  i want one service to have all movies . 
  i guess studios need to stop giving exclusive rights to one service . 
  we totally should change the eu language to french or german to annoy them . 
  that would be glorious . 
  does speaking german give extra points ? 
   i 'd ask germany to either recover their tanks and fully refund or fully deduce it from ongoing debts . 
  wait what ? 
  how is that the fault of the german state ? 
  even the cdu said it wo n't try to lower the minimum wage . 
  honestly , i think almost no one really knows what effects the brexit could have , not even many politicians or economic scientists . 
  especially since your last election . 
  no one tried to bring 500.000 syrians to poland . 
  implying no other country would ever do this . 
  there is no way france , germany , benelux , austria and italy will end up without an union, 
  also the eu ca n't block your anti porn laws anymore . 
  phew , luckily it 's not the netherlands who holds the referendum . 
  threatening someone to get a desired decision does n't sound like democracy to me . 
  yeah if the majority of the eu agrees to something and the uk do n't , we will do what the majority wants . 
  that 's democracy . 
  aww man , not italy again . 
  maybe england and france can borrow some lebensraum ?
