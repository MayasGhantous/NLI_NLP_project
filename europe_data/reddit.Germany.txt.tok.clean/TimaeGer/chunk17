  however , this has shifted as the `` troika '' ( i.e. , european central bank or ecb , international monetary fund or imf , and a european government-sponsored fund ) have purchased greek bonds . 
  as of early 2015 , the largest individual contributors to the fund were germany , france and italy with roughly $ 130bn total of the $ 323bn debt . 
  [ 128 ] the imf is owed $ 32bn and the ecb $ 20bn . 
  foreign banks had little greek debt . 
   if merkel wants to send 10s of billions of euros ( i wonder how greeks feel about this plan eh ... ) why are so many people saying things like this ? 
  europe send almost 300 billion to help greece . 
  that came across way harsher than i meant to . 
  i was trying to say that there are people who are anti-refugee and anti-immigration and these people also are n't in favour of romanians coming to their country . 
   we need more of old europe . 
  not the wars or the hate , certainly , but we do need the pride to stand up and shout to the world that european values are the best values and that our culture and civilization are superior . 
  no we do n't . 
  we need more of a `` do whatever the fuck you want as long as you do n't harm me . '', 
  attitude . 
   according to the european commission : [ 4 ] the motto means that , via the eu , europeans are united in working together for peace and prosperity . 
  seems like i had the same idea  we have free-trade and free movement of people because it 's benefiting both sides . 
  germany has a bigger market and can outsource some industries for cheaper workforce , romania gets industry , jobs and aid to build infrastructure . 
  i also do n't value a german life more than every other nationality . 
  think what you want , but - for me - being born in a specific country does n't make you more important than other people . 
  germany does n't need to stop thinking of themselves before other eu countries , the eu needs more power so it can care and help all eu countries . 
  right , the article just says the trade surplus within the eurozone decreased . 
  but there is no indication that it increased within the eu . 
  it just says the exports increased , what is n't bad when the import increased more . 
  yes i think many californians would say the same . 
  the difference is that it would n't be california helping iowa , the federal government would help iowa . 
  germany does n't need to stop thinking of themselves before other eu countries , the eu needs more power so it can care and help ** all ** eu countries . 
  but the article says germanys trade surplus within the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ eurozone decreased ? 
  sorry to break it to you , but many western europeans do n't see a difference between romania and egypt . 
  they see both the way you see these evil refugees . 
  we have free-trade and free movement of people because it 's benefiting both sides . 
  germany has a bigger market and can outsource some industries for cheaper workforce , romania gets industry , jobs and aid to build infrastructure . 
  but romania is in the eu and get all its benefits , while egypt is n't ? 
  also , yes it is racist to see more value in a white european than a black african . 
  because ukraine is still pretty save in 75 % of the country . 
  yeah there is no outcry for the poverty in ukraine or in moldova , but neither for 90 % of the african countries . 
  `` if ** you ** [ germany ] actually cared about employing europeans and paying a decent wage there would be ** eu regulation ** to better phase out income inequality and spain and greece would n't be in the shit they are for 5 years . '', 
  hhahaha you just blame everything on germany do n't you ? 
  germany does n't run the eu , it even has far less power in the parliament than it should have based on population and gdp . 
  so instead of blaming everything bad that ever happened in some european country on germany , why do n't you join a eu party and actually do something to have it the way you want to ? 
  i agree on the whole eu helping each other stuff , but you make it seem like germanys only purpose should be to give all their money , industry and jobs to the rest of eu . 
   within the eu , exports to the eurozone climbed by 5.9 percent , while exports to european countries outside the single currency area grew by 8.9 percent . 
   in december alone , however , both exports and imports declined by 1.6 percent in calendar - and seasonally-adjusted terms , meaning that the trade surplus ** contracted slightly ** to 19.4 billion euros , destatis said . 
   i never heard a single case of rape . 
  and trust me , where i am from word gets out really fast to everybody . 
   never seen or heard a firearm in my life . 
   was never attacked and/or beaten up by unknown people . 
  implying these things are n't true for germany . 
  i 'm not opposed to include the whole european continent into schengen , criminals will not stop coming to germany because its illegal . 
  i just wanted to say that every european union member is n't completely sovereign and needs to follow eu rules . 
  our union , our rules ? 
  we need to do both , controlling external borders does n't help against to many genuine refugees for italy and greece . 
  why would they agree to something that continuous to give them all the refugees ? 
  since september , merkel has been talking about secured border , hotspots at the main routes of refugees - so in greece , italy and hungary - where everyone can claim their asylum and a fair relocating strategy taking a country 's size , economy and population in account . 
  it 's the only fair and doable solution , we could have had it all sorted out for 5 month now , but some countries still do n't think it 's their problem . 
  i really do n't know what they see in the ` union ' part of eu . 
  we are obligated to help them , the right to search asylum is a human right . 
  do n't you think cutting aid will do the opposite of what you want ? 
  like more people fleeing because their country just got shittier ? 
  there are still many genuine and rightful asylum claims , we are obligated to help them and give them asylum . 
  it 's a human right , the eu should be the very very last to break human rights . 
  we need relocation for them , because it 's just unfair to say greece and italy can deal with all of them , dublin ii is a pretty stupid treaty . 
  it 's more that the amount of refugees never have been so high . 
  the eu had sorted it out , they passed all the responsibilities to greece and italy , which is unfair , but worked perfectly fine until last summer . 
  now you could foresee the increase of refugees , but there are still many eu countries that say `` not our problem '' . 
  alternatively one could just post the wikipedia link of the anthem . 
  it often includes an english translation . 
  yeah there are literally over a million rape cases in germany committed by refugees !, 
  you know , because that is the rule for them , they are all the same !, 
   felt significant impact on your life . 
   i , for example , had to leave two sports clubs because their training halls were `` confiscated '' to house refugees dear god !, 
  way simplified : weak currency -  it 's cheaper for other currencies to buy products from you , but it 's more expensive to buy products from others . 
  -  good for exporting economies , bad for importing economies . 
  also kind of bad for normal people because buying stuff in foreign currencies is more expensive , so for example travelling gets more expensive . 
  i recently bought a humble bundle for 15 $ . 
  had to pay 14.20 $ , half a year ago it would have been ~ 11 $ :( strong currency -  basically the opposite . 
  so a nice balanced currency is desirable . 
  so positive stories are useless anecdotes , but negative stories , such as a mayor of an irrelevant small town saying some bullshit , is newsworthy and relevant ? 
  searching in english only got me american success stories , so here are a few german articles . 
  because that 's what people want to read . 
  just look at r/europe , articles with negative stories get way more clicks and comments than neutral reports . 
  same with the girl that got raped ... according to russia . 
  if you lived in germany right now you would probably laugh or cry at all the people blowing this whole thing way out of proportion . 
  you do n't even recognise refugees most of the time . 
   von der maas bis an die memel , von der etsch bis an den belt the etsch , or adige in english , is right below austria . 
  what makes you think that italy would want to cooperate with v4 , nations that do everything to not help italy and greece with refugees ? 
  what 's more `` expert '' than describing a whole nation with 80 million people , 6 political parties with very diverse solution approaches even within the parties and overall an unwillingness to lead europe as `` a dog that chases a car . 
  when it finally catches it , it does n't know what to do . '', 
  to be fair , we included you in our anthem . 
  nah we stole that one . 
  maybe people got bored ? 
  refugees are the main news for quite some time now , way longer than most things survive in news . 
   refugees we singlehandedly invited  yeah , i invited north africa and the middle east and if you do n't like it you can fuck off totally not blaming germany for it . 
  i wonder how things would have worked out if germany just continued to say fuck you to greece , italy and hungary like many other eu countries . 
  1 + million refugees in greece , fun times . 
  germany is allowing that ? 
  last time i checked germany did not border turkey . 
  the whole eu is allowing that . 
  there is really no point in discussing this if you still think the refugee crisis is germanys fault . 
  thats exactly want i meant with `` many other eu countries say ` its not our problem ' and think more about who to blame rather than a solution '', 
  often not legally . 
  for example netflix : every european country has a different library .
