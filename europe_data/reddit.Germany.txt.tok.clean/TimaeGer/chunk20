  we have open borders , it 's a positive thing you can just pass through germany without having to identify and register yourself . 
   wait . 
  you mean like all of them ? 
  i do n't think so , only the official one . 
  according to that logic there would be no luxury products . 
  you 're rightful holy roman ^ ^ ^ german clay after all . 
  i think he meant that other countries would have to get on the level of greece . 
  switzerland on the other hand ... 
   hobby programming projects , play music ... math , sciences so you would do something productive ? 
  i think these would be the minority , people get bored , you just ca n't do nothing all the time . 
  also hartz4 is 400 $ + rent and some stuff , basic income would n't be far more , and people want to work . 
  no member country of the eu is independent . 
  get over it . 
  lol , korea ? 
  poor switzerland . 
  nice how we decided this was a bullshit article in its thread but you post it anyway . 
  yet . 
  i tried to make it easy for google translate . 
  [ my first banana ] ( http://www.titanic-magazin.de/fileadmin/_migrated/pics/card_377670833.jpg ), 
  only east berlin of course . 
  it 's massive when these are refugees , but i think these 800k ukrainians mostly are n't refugees . 
  every country has several 100 thousand migrants . 
  but the ukrainians in poland are n't refugees , at least not all of them . 
  for the biggest part they are normal migrants . 
  800k overall or in the last year / last two years ? 
  overall would n't be that impressive . 
  many easter european countries are very corrupt and we do n't care . 
  that 's because ghettos look like shit everywhere , it 's not a soviet thing . 
  so which country do you think could attack the eu , survive and actually get anything from it ? 
  yeah welcome to globalisation . 
  no country is independent . 
  i guess you meant france right ? 
  maybe , but i think their politicians are smarter than that and actually realise france and germany have more or less the same interests and are really dependent on each other . 
  same with the rest of the countries i listed , they are n't puppets , they just have the same interests as germany and are economically really dependent on germany , so they have the same policies . 
  austria , netherlands , denmark , france , belgium maybe czech republic would leave too and form a new union . 
   estonia - 62  romania - 62  austria - 56 get rekt austria, 
  yes , its the most upvoted thread in this sub . 
  that 's because op did n't use the [ right map ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hj1lvda.png ), 
  i 'm sure you meant this . 
  i bet there were more development points in austria + hungary and stuff + the hre than in the british empire . 
  imposed by one million refugees onto 80 million others , of course !, 
  maybe you should visit germany some day , i do n't think the reality matches your picture of it . 
   how about some brown uniforms ?!, 
  with a little tweak here and there . 
  yeah to me that 's okay and i think it 's stupid german law bans that , as long as you do n't harm someone you can wear whatever you want . 
  so there was a pro cannabis demonstration in munich a year ago and one guy had [ this west ] ( http://imgur.com/vpqvb41 ) . 
  the pressure, 
  did they pretend to be official police officers ? 
  apparently the court does n't think so . 
   at worst they harassed people but it was impossible to prove . 
  so you want to punish them for something you ca n't prove ? 
  nice . 
  wearing a west saying `` sharia police '' is not illegal . 
  the german reichstag is pretty cool , too . 
  i think you will find many free pdfs on the internet . 
  at least in german it 's not hard to find . 
  [ obviously . 
  ] ( http://www.noz.de/media/2013/09/05/martin-sonneborn-ehemaliger-chefredakteur-der-zei_full.jpg ) but for real , sch\u00e4uble would be an alternative . 
  where 2.2 million refugees are and about 300k from them have some kind of housing or aid , the rest its roaming around somewhere . 
  alright , thanks !, 
  is this true ? 
  mods ? 
  why do n't you answer to something like this ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ukj7y/holodomor_remembrance_day_extermination_by_hunger/cxfmd2s so who is right ? 
  austrian - german vs russian - georgian yeaaaah ... 
  he was n't russian . 
  ca n't you get like , a normal loan from a bank ? 
  gib oil moneys . 
  this has nothing to do with direct democracy . 
   for example switzerland has a cross-party federal council instead of a single head of state . 
  the large parties are forced to come together and make long term plans that they will implement together . 
  that sounds brilliant . 
  why is n't it standard everywhere ? 
  russian backed kurdish state in syria incoming . 
  germany is like : ehhhh , we just build the stuff , you 're fighting okay ? 
  right , raf were just freedom fighter !, 
  christmas markets are open before christmas . 
  what the hell ? 
  the main gun of the m1 abrams is from germany . 
  yes , i think these people wo n't have to sleep outside if poland would help . 
  [ this is simple . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/cornflakes_in_bowl.jpg ), 
  true , missed a space , thanks !, 
  that 's what i mean . 
  we did n't control you , but we were in the same `` nation '' . 
  well , you were a part of us for the most time in the last millennium sooo . . 
  do n't worry , apparently we still have lebensraum in brandenburg !, 
  you can see the borders between germany and denmark and germany and czech republic , makes me think there is a lack of data from denmark and czech republic . 
  and now think about how many poland took with their whooping $ 0.47 billion foreign development aid . 
  lets ignore all problems but the biggest one !, 
  germany already took almost one million refugees . 
  so where are these problems ? 
  some brawls in the refugees camps ? 
  is this enough to say `` germany ca n't take them '' ? 
  okay , draw a straight line from these countries to germany . 
  now look at the line and tell me the countries that can take all the refugees without problems , like germany can . 
  yeah these damn cry babies from eritrea and afghanistan . 
  if the whole eu would help there wo n't be a crisis . 
  honestly ? 
  something like next year .
