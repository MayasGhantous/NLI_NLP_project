  now with the brexit we might get it again  edit : damn that tower , planed by donald trump , designed by albert speer jr , son of the nazi architect albert speer , likely to be build because of the brexit . 
  beautiful . 
  how to handle automatisation . 
  it 's really scary that even the new york times is doing it . 
  are you seriously comparing greece with somalia ? 
  people here really really dislike brown people . 
   these geriatric buildings so much better looking than modern ones ? 
  [ what ?

  [ also ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/47/new_kids_cast.jpg ) in german it 's hilarious , too , as the original actors do it . 
  yeah , but who would want to live there ? 
  to be fair , there were never that many people in brandenburg or mecklenburg-vorpommern . 
  you could argue that it did n't increase at all during communsim . 
  yes i think brexit will help , but it 's already getting better , many students are going to and staying in east germany because it 's way cheaper . 
  so to anyone who plans to study in germany , east germany is the way to go . 
  yes , look at north-east germany [ here ] ( http://www.deutsche-mittelgebirge.de/deutschlandkarte_bevoelkerungsdichte_klein.jpg ) . 
  thanks to / u/nogshag i just realised the map is from 1999 , [ here ] ( https://www.demografie-portal.de/shareddocs/bilder/informieren/zahlenfakten/bevoelkerungsdichte_gemeinden.png?__blob=normal&amp;v=6 ) is one from 2013 , not that many differences . 
  it has 5 million people to go to get to the levels of london . 
  east germany is reeeaaally empty . 
  only 52 % voted for that . 
  ` germany 's european union commissioner ' heavily implies that he works for germany . 
  how can a european union commissioner belong to a country ? 
  he has nothing to do with germany besides being born there . 
  well , i do n't think many from the eu side would disagree . 
  weird , usually there are dozens of buttons telling me to sign up and read the rest , nothing here . 
  where is this all from ? 
  the article you linked only has the first 3 paragraphs ... 
  how do you decide who deserves immigration programms ? 
  i thought the german navy was controlled by the dutch navy , so sneaky dutchies just got control of polands subs ? 
  for a lot of central , eastern and balkan countries it used to be german due to the hre and austria-hungary . 
  free movement , germanys record low unemployment rates and need for labour could help german , too . 
  [ well ... ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/02/brexit-news-live-thousands-march-for-europe-in-post-referendum-protest?page=with:block-57779bc2e4b0b320cf128a35#block-57779bc2e4b0b320cf128a35 ), 
  i could get behind that . 
  let 's fund some epic marmor/stone stadiums in greece !, 
  because with meat you need 10 times the vegetables , pesticides and fertilisers and ship them and the meat across the world . 
  look in to beans , many have even more proteins than meat . 
  how much wheat do you need to get 1 kg meat ? 
   oh , and you could just eat some soy beans , they have more proteins than beef  ), 
  we would need way less agriculture , and therefore fertilisers , in the first place without meat . 
  everything birdlover said would significantly be reduced . 
  what ? 
  meat is the most expensive food out there . 
  the only vitamin that 's problematic is b12 and you get that from consuming milk related product or eggs . 
  so if you are vegan , you have to buy some pills for 5 $ our a toothpaste for 6 $ once in a while , hardly more expensive as meat . 
  dude maybe you should do some research , humans can live completly healthy without meat . 
  i do n't think anything that will cost too much jobs in the eu and uk will happen , that would be stupid to do just for the sake of not breaking the rules . 
  i can imagine they will just continue with single market acces and all the stuff that comes with it when the uk leaves until they negotiated a new deal . 
  soooo no one from the remain side actually got the idea to research this stuff before the referendum and use it as an argument ? 
   depends on what agreement the uk puts in place that 's the only thing we can say honestly , the rest is just speculation . 
  but i can see the eu having an interest in getting these juicy banking jobs inside the eu . 
   the chairman of hsbc has ruled out moving the bank 's ** headquarters ** away from london following the uk 's vote to leave the eu . 
   the decision followed 10 months of internal debate about whether the bank would be better off based overseas -- most likely in ** hong kong ** . 
  so this has not really much to do with their eu trade , they probably have to move this part inside the eu, 
  afd is not against a european union , [ here ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-spefbx9zstq/uzlxby4enti/aaaaaaaaasa/y-u2iw-znia/s1600/mut-zu-deutschland.png ) is one of their posters . 
  however , they want less eu influence and more nation sovereignty . 
   by tyler durden interesting, 
  we have the exactly same election system here in germany , it 's completly fine . 
  you even knew the presidential candidate for each party before the parliament election . 
  well it did n't happend in germany nor in the usa right ? 
  well you could print your own money without the euro . 
  i do n't really know , maybe you can find the paper somewhere . 
  sh\u00e4uble did n't want a grexit . 
  if i remember correctly he suggested something like 5 years outside the euro zone . 
  i thought the french were our best buddies :(, 
  implying there was no sexual harassment before we took in refugees . 
  i 'm still waiting to see a difference after we let 1.5 million refugees in . 
  i 've lived in two medium sized cities ( ~ 200k ) since the crisis , literally nothing changed . 
  wie in deutschland so in europa, 
  denmark , you 're germany now . 
  france pushed for the euro . 
  how can you not support the eu with this guy on top ? 
  that youtube chat is hilarious . 
  german has the most native speaker in europe , on the other hand . 
  ehhh , it 's not like it 's usual to have a single market , open borders and free movement between countries , especially not if they are on the other side of the earth . 
  please do n't switch sides :(, 
  i was under the impression that free movement was one of the core requirements to have eu single market access, 
   you can not have full access to the single market and not accept its rules . 
  if we gave that kind of deal to the uk , then why not to australia or new zealand . 
  yeah , why ca n't we have free movement with australia and nz ? 
  judging from the map of historic and current population range , finland did n't go to well with bears . 
  on the other side , more members leaving can do more harm to the eu economies than a harsh deal with the uk . 
  [ ... :( ] ( http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=dax ), 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4q2baw/german_french_ministers_plan_for_strong_europe_in/ the article does n't have the original papers , put it 's definitely based on them . 
  you should post this in another thread , as this one was removed . 
  germany finally can into oversee provinces ? 
  keep in mind that it 's a show , the interviewees are well picked . 
  look up where gb is located on a map . 
  they are if they want to continue trading with all their neighbours . 
  yes please !, 
  i 'm sure benelux would n't be too mad about this either . 
  yes , just look how hard everyone argues against vegetarians and vegans , something i guarantee you will be the norm in 30 years . 
   in my opinion , democracy is a failed idea . 
  instead of abandoning the eu , we should abandon democracy . 
  so we can make progress towards evidence-based decisionmaking structures in politics . 
  ehh , we should just stop giving all the power to populist politicians and sensational media and stop using direct democracy . 
  ignore university , just compare the school systems from today and from 40 years ago . 
  the level of education , hell even the expectation on how much education people get is way higher today . 
  i do n't think having practical skills gives you any insights in something like the brexit . 
  i bet your friends know a hundred times more about these things than a 60 year old fisherman in a village with 100 inhabitants . 
  in the case of economics , macroeconomics and geopolitics , yes , yes it does .
