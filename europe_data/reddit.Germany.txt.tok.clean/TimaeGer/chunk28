  luckily this is reddit . 
  if you freely decide to follow another persons decisions and are free to stop any time , it 's not making you a slave . 
  especially when you can vote on these decisions . 
  not really , they can decide to stop getting rules from the higher body any time . 
  even when you are completely free to vote out ? 
  do n't you see it ? 
  they literally have a referendum if they want the eu or not . 
  they are not sovereign !, 
  how do you think that would go ? 
  oh you 're not british , so we ca n't put you into a british prison . 
  oh , we ca n't deport you either . 
  oh well free you are \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  why ? 
  in many european countries you will learn english anyway . 
  we completly destroyed cities in finland ? 
  do you want to destroy the uk ? 
  is n't freedom of movement a part of eea ? 
  most of the world is absolutely fine . 
  it 's basically only africa left with too high birth rates . 
  europea really does n't need less children . 
  declining is relative . 
  if you have 8 kids per woman 's , declining is definitely good . 
  if you have 1 , not so . 
  so were countless others groups before and after the nazis ? 
  ww2 was n't the deadliest war in human history . 
  yeah maybe uber should fulfill the laws first . 
  i do n't think poland is as densely populated as england . 
  lidl has beer in fucking plastic bottles in germany . 
  usually paella is in frozen bags in germany . 
  i do n't think it 's too bad . 
  is n't tobacco profitable for most governments because the tax revenue is higher than the healthcare costs ? 
  why would n't it be the same with other drugs ? 
  let 's be honest , the top people of the eu have way more insight and knowledge what 's going on than 99 % of this sub . 
  the most famous guy from the left party ( die linke ) in germany gysi ^ ( please him ) just said he wants a common chancellor candidate for die linke , the greens and spd . 
  we are getting there !, 
  jesus how are people still falling for you, 
  yeah that 's a fair point . 
  nonetheless , in my experiences younger people often do feel more european than their parents . 
  if the referendum happened 20-30 years later i can imagine 60-70 % voting to stay in the eu . 
  of course that mainly based on young germans . 
  yeah that looks pretty linear to me . 
  i think the difference between ages is really interesting . 
  that will sound mean , and of course people with the age 65 + should 100 % have a say in everything , but it 's kind of weird . 
  young people will have to study/work/live within or outside of the eu , and it 's clear what they prefer , while there is n't much change for older people , or am i missing something ? 
  what advantages are in for them if they leave ? 
  which nation between germany/austria and syria/middle east is capable of hosting one million + extra refugees then ? 
  would be awkward with germany in between . 
  we should kick out east germany and unite to the glorious rheinbund . 
  yeah slowenia is totally capable of hosting one million + refugees . 
  aww man , no anschluss this time ? 
  charlemange 2.0 here we go !, 
  older than the aztecs . 
  yeah true , but i do n't expect them to be like people from hamburg in the next 50 years . 
  slovenia was under german control for 1300 years and they still exist . 
  while fear certainly is used on both sides , i do n't think it 's unreasonable to assume britain will suffer some economic damage from an exit . 
  it 's weird how many people think it will have no effect on british and other european economies . 
  bavaria has been in germany for 200 years and they have n't lost their cultural identity . 
  hell even in france there still are regional cultures . 
  i 've only ever seen [ these ] ( http://imgur.com/3shlzsc ) in danisch vacation houses . 
  no first hand experiences , but i think light switches in america generally look like [ this ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mam4zusxrj1rtc5bq.jpg ) , while [ german ones ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/lichtschalter.jpg ) are bigger . 
  denmark does n't have them : /, 
  we already have the saarland for this . 
  probably the establishment of prussia as a great power with berlin as its capital . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/einwohnerentwicklung_von_berlin#von_1709_bis_1822 ) berlin got a huge boost from huguenots/protestants from france and other states settling in brandenburg because it was really tolerant . 
  apparently , around 1700 , 25 % of berlins population was french . 
  in 1710 berlin integrated a few surrounding cities pushing it from 20k to 50k . 
  according to [ this german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bev%c3%b6lkerungsentwicklung_von_istanbul ) it had 500k in 1000 . 
  the [ english one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul#demographics ) says up to 300k . 
  i 'm pretty sure it counted as european . 
  wikipedia says the modern taste was invented in italy . 
  well electric cars do n't have direct air emissions . 
  nrw has a higher population density than the netherlands , what lebensraum ? 
  d : also , is n't our navy part of yours ? 
  [  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4jzk00/germany_is_very_very_tired/d3bdc8u ), 
  we are fist at both , 
  it does n't matter what germany is doing , i simply stated that if poland tried to stop using coal , the whole eu would cheer and present poland as a role model . 
  we really need to get rid of the `` yeah , but you ... ! '', 
  argument in this sub . 
  golden eagle    bald eagle, 
  yeah well if that something is ignoring the constitution ... you should try and get rid of coal , i bet everybody will cheer for you . 
  [ here we go !, 
  ] ( http://unser-mitteleuropa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/hofer-heimat.jpeg ), 
   just stay in berlin , because surrounding brandenburg is exclusively old people and dick forest . 
  [ brandenbuuuurg ] ( https://youtu.be/uellmyna34u ), 
  that sounded unnecessarily mean :(, 
  if you are n't in bavaria or baden-w\u00fcrttemberg and the cops do n't have a really bad day no one cares if you are smoking weed . 
  in north rhine westfalia you can carry around up to 10g for your own usage . 
  never listened much to fler . 
  haftbefehl was funny at the beginning but he gets quite annoying and exhausting to listen to . 
  i like more melodic/fitting stuff ( do n't really know how to describe it ) like [ motrip ] ( https://youtu.be/0nv63wxc7wm?t=58s ) or [ this here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkf7b6klxcc ) . 
  not exactly current . 
  also , i do n't listen to him much . 
  i can recommend ssio . 
  he has really good beats so it 's not that bad if you do n't understand german . 
  [ ssio - nutt\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udcyjlesrow ) starts at 1:50 [ ssio - nullkommaneun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slei8n08cqk ) starts at 2:40 [ ssio - ich fibicke jeden / halb mensch , halb nase ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5wau7cz34s ), 
  ehh the tone in this sub is usually `` the eu needs a complete reform '' . 
  i really do n't know where this is coming from . 
   to keep shitting everything up . 
  oh come one ... 
  overall the eu did far more good things than shitty things .
