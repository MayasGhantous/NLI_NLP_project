   the agreement signed last week between russia 's gazprom pjsc and european companies including royal dutch shell plc , eon ag and engie to expand the nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea , ** `` completely neglects polish interests ** , '' duda said tuesday  `` the insecurity in this context stems from the ** egoism of some nations ** and their complete disregard for the interest of other nations , '' duda said . 
  lol, 
  no they will not . 
  why would they if they do n't become anything in germany ? 
  it 's so ironic how everyone here made fun of the u.s. because trump is a serious candidate and now they all want the same as him . 
  if a refugee gets hosted in slovakia , he will get food , housing etc only in slovakia . 
  well , not putting nato bases in poland has definitey not ended in a russian invasion of poland . 
  and you know for sure other countries did n't know the plan before she made it public ? 
  must be awesome to live in a tent with 100 other people , eat mass produced food and get 140 $ pocket money each month . 
  i always thought we use ` zwo ' because ` zwei ' sounds too similar to ` drei ' and could get confused, 
  especially when , not too long ago , they were these economic immigrants they all cry about . 
  fuck yeah , lets make all poles slaves again !, 
  we can always start sending them back no ? 
  queen is an uk thing , we should call her empress . 
  http://www.ted.com/talks/rainer_strack_the_surprising_workforce_crisis_of_2030_and_how_to_start_solving_it_now we need them , even automatisation is n't enough . 
  it dropped because people think she acted to slowly and turns a blind eye on the right wing terrorism we have against refugees , not because people do n't like that we help people . 
  why is it always so important who said something ? 
  does it change anything if merkel or an article author says the same thing ? 
  does merkel saying it make it more right ? 
  it was a joke . 
  well , we ca n't just block all energy imports . 
  like others mention , most of syrians have an education level comparable to the german mandatory education , what is just fine to work as the lowest position in industrial giants like mercedes , bmw , audi etc. 
  these jobs pay really good and they will at least pay an average amount of taxes . 
  we teach them german in their asylum camps and being forced to use german almost everyday will make them learn it really fast . 
  often there are no fences . 
  if you think the average syrian ca n't read or write you are retarded . 
  almost all syrians are refugees . 
  funny how the east have twice as many left voters , but are less in favour of refugees than the west . 
  the article says it 's mainly because non-eu countries import less , so it 's not because austerity of eu countries . 
  there are millions of refugees who stay in turkey , lebanon , italy and greece . 
  for longer distances planes are really cheap . 
  if you book your flight early enough with ryanair you can fly for 20-30 $ everywhere . 
  germany 's finance minister is saying its sustainable . 
  we do n't just hope it ends at sime point , we know it . 
  this war is going to end . 
  asylum is n't meant to be a long term solution . 
  many of these people will leave when the war is over . 
  how do you explain the million refugees in turkey or lebanon if they all want to go to germany ? 
  i think distribution quotas will come with eu money . 
  and i assume the costs of living are the same as in germany or sweden ? 
  i bet there will be a few refugees who would rather take less money per month and have a higher chance of staying than taking more money in germany , where they might get moved to other countries again . 
  when other countries start to take refugees and refugees going there can assume to get their asylum accepted and allowed to stay there , i can imagine they wo n't try as hard as now to get to germany . 
  i will never get this logic . 
  just because you remove some poor people other poor people do n't get richer . 
  why do n't you look to the rich and say `` if you were n't so rich , we poor would n't be as poor . 
  i do n't think many religious people think their god is the same one as in other religions just with a different name . 
  yeah because there were absolutely no refugees in italy and greece before we started taking them . 
  what a joke statement . 
  and the god of christianity does n't say that about himself ? 
  yeah what the hell , its not about sending good songs . 
  as an eu4 player : how the hell did you survive there and how are you not muslim ? 
  we always have a place for you , 
  how is that unacceptable ? 
  you do n't have to do it , we just want you to do it . 
  well your comment makes sense if you just answered to my comment and ignored the rest of the chain . 
  but my comment was an answer to some nonsense that taking refugees wil lower wages , what ca n't happen because of unions . 
  inflation has nothing to do with that . 
  and we all know inflation exists because of refugees . 
  thanks for bringing this up , how could i forget that . 
  i do n't think most germans and merkel want other eu countries to refugees we take or already have . 
  they want them to take new refugees . 
  yeah i get that , that 's pretty standard . 
  but where do you put the refugees now ? 
  so now that we are economically dominant we take all the refugees to be morally superior ? 
  genius !, 
  how the hell is outsourcing relevant here ? 
  i thought this was about lower payments for germans because we take refugees ? 
  do you even think about what you are posting , or do you just write the first fearful thought you get ? 
  except when it ca n't , like in germany . 
  but helping people is basically the same as war is n't it ? 
  oh come on , do n't start with germany wanted the greece crisis ... 
  that 's unfair against hessen and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ... 
  that 's not how it is . 
  merkel and other german politicians are saying that we need an eu approach to handle the refugees since at least 6 month , before we got these huge refugee numbers . 
  we also tried to use the distribution quota we have within germany europe wide month ago . 
  it 's a difference if a country with 1.4 million refugees says ` we ca n't take them all ' or a country with ... 
  does poland even have refugees yet ? 
  we are in the eu . 
  me voting in the eu elections will have some influence on poland . 
  that 's what an union is about . 
  making decisions together . 
  yeah we ca n't take them all . 
  but we can try to take as many as we and poland can definitely take more . 
  have fun with lowering wages against germany 's worker unions . 
  turkey ca n't take them all . 
  because that 's what many people want to think . 
  i do n't think many germans were in favour of the third greece bailout . 
  also many many germans support gay marriage , but merkel does n't . 
  i think that passage was about the thalys shooting . 
  i 'm not sarcastic . 
  i think it 's awesome because these people are fleeing a war and we can save lifes giving them asylum . 
  germany is super fucking rich and we are easily capable of spending billions to save lifes . 
  yeah obviously she was in favour of refugees . 
  but i did n't expect something like this : `` chancellor angela merkel said germany must respond to the european refugee crisis with the same resolve it showed in rescuing banks and her government will spend billions of euros to handle the tide of migrants . '', 
  i would have never expected such a pro refugee position from our government . 
  awesome !, 
  and germany will take them , teach them german , give them a machine at mercedes/bmw/siemens / rheinmetall and make more money . 
  meanwhile rest of europe will blame germany for their economy . 
  yeah i thought so , too , when i wrote that . 
  did n't want to phrase it that way but i could n't came up with better words :d,
