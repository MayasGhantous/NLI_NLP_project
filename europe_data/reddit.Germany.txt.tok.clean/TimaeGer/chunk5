  east germans left their country illegally , too . 
  and there are only ~ 200k seekers so far . 
  yes , nationalism is bad . 
  it creates a mentality of we vs them . 
  also , having a shared culture , language or history does have nothing to do with nationality . 
  the usa or switzerland does n't have a shared culture or language for every citizen . 
  germany and austria share many things , yet they are two different nations . 
  so you just guessed 600.000 ? 
  the article does n't mention this number . 
  source ? 
  russia so free everyone can get a tank . 
  so old rich men ? 
  how do people genuinely believe taking refugees will destroy their own country . 
  austria of course !, 
  it 's more like germany and france both say no . 
  that 's the end of discussion . 
  why does everything sound so fancy in french ? 
  so every german needs to be able to live in berlin before refugees get some decent housing ? 
  this is n't about trade surplus . 
  you could sell some provinces ... 
  it 's working out quite well for poland is n't it ? 
  they are our problems . 
  we should deal with it . 
  there is place , even in germany . 
  the state mecklenburg-vorpommern has 69 inhabitants per square kilometre . 
  germany has over 200 . 
  i think , ff you would give land to refugee groups or families where they can build up a new life , they would stay there . 
  why would n't they ? 
  it 's not like they will get more in germany . 
  dude you should stop ranting about this on the internet and go to a refugee camp or a city with some migrants and talk to them . 
  they are not like you seem to think . 
  we are n't racist anymore . 
  see ? 
  we are all better off working together . 
  so please help us with refugees . 
  these are asylum seekers , not receivers . 
  many will get their asylum denied and deported to their home country , as almost half of them come from the balkan countries , which just got declared as safe . 
  also , i can tell from my experience that these refugees are n't bad . 
  i live in a smaller village where they just put 300 refugees . 
  the only problems are worried and scared racists . 
  the first few days there was some trash on the main street to the supermarket , but after they gave trash bags to the refugees and the refugees went to pick it up it 's super clean . 
  the manager of the supermarket said he had to hire security , but there was no single crime yet . 
  austria agrees . 
  let italy , uk , germany , sweden and france stop paying all the other states and see how fast they will take refugees . 
  it 's really egoistic from countries to not want refugees but are totally fine in taking the eu money . 
  but taking eu money is fine ? 
  you got ta take the bad with the good in an union . 
  why ? 
  germany is pretty much the opposite of just big cities :d, 
  holy shit you have a letter for just the points of \u00fc ? 
  do you know what happens to male new born chickens in industrialised countries ? 
  assuming our understanding of physics is 100 % correct right now . 
  seems like they integrated really well . 
  then listen to the uk . 
  they have invented your language after all . 
  no sane european would take peanut butter over nutella !, 
  you ca n't really compare their socialism to west/north european social elements . 
  angry poles incoming . 
  0/10 not worth, 
  why would you not use the country borders as borders between the states within the federation ? 
  holy shit , our tv shows were n't easy . 
  why would you not use the country borders ? 
  see ? 
  that 's why we control the eu . 
  everyone else just do n't know what 's best for them !, 
  no she is not . 
  what translates to : '' ' i think , germany should also accept economic refugees . ', 
  [ ... ] it would be nice , if people factually discussed it . '', 
  did you even listen to her comment ? 
  she actually states that anti refugee opinions and discussions regarding refugees are totally acceptable , but hate speech and racist chants and violence is not . 
  i 'm pretty sure they teach british english in german schools . 
  just because you are diverse you do n't have to kill each other , 
  its blue and shiny !, 
  how dare you, 
  and because i 'm in a happy mood and really generous , we will give you half india for absolutely no cost !,

  its our plan to get you into the eurozone : give everyone their african colonies back . 
  you can always use one of [ these ] ( https://cache-inn.de/bilder/produkte/gross/maxpedition-octa-versipack-bauchtasche_b7.jpg ) !, 
  swag and yolo were really popular . 
  i agree . 
  we should remove at least 1c and 2c , too . 
  its just useless and all you ever do with it is throwing it in a corner .

  well , ca n't blame them . 
  spanish is easier , spoken by more people and sounds a million times better . 
  you do n't have to learn a third language in france ? 
  thames and rhine together . 
  that 's a big river . 
  the u.s. is an all-seeing god in everyone 's eyes who somehow followed the snowden leaks . 
  i think it 's pretty safe to say the u.s. played some role in it . 
  it would be naive to believe otherwise considering their history of meddling with foreign politics . 
  also , germany is producing a lot of other stuff . 
  to be fair , france got rekt every time . 
  `` because of gema '', 
  [ d\u00fcsseldorf ] ( https://hiphopseminar.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/affe.jpg ) the small white text on the left says : `` money makes you stupid '' and in red below it `` poverty , too '' . 
  above the ape it says `` what to do ? 
  never lived there , only visited multiple times . 
  i loved it . 
  well , we are on a good way to get there again , as the u.s. does n't seem to care about education and more and more curses at universities are taught in english here in germany . 
   i like the german contribution to a modern university education , to arts , science germany was the place to go for science and education before ww2 .
