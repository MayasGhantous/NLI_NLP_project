  and we get a tunnel from r\u00f8dbyhavn , denmark , to fehmarn , germany . 
  so scandinavia is even more connected !, 
  fuel is really cheap in the us , too , so there is really no reason to improve the train system . 
  i like the germany + netherlands shape in frankfurts picture . 
  ` tens of thousands ' = 7500 ? 
  i 'm not even sure if you are serious . 
  man , what would we do without bulgaria taking all the 5 refugees . 
  polands economy is way stronger than greeces . 
  they will do fine in the euro zone . 
  come on austria , not again . 
  where do you draw the line whats race and whats ... `` just different culture '' ? 
  yes . 
  what else ? 
  yeah because saying there is only place for one culture in this country is n't racist . 
  europe became really racist lately . 
  i still ca n't decide if this is good or bad . 
  so we need to conquer new land and consumers for our glorious euro zone ? 
  got it . 
  must suck to have such nightmares . 
  i think we all can agree that we would be better off being ruled by germany . 
  meanwhile the top comment is `` at least we are not american . '', 
  economic espionage . 
  it 's a nice solution to greeces dept problem . 
  of course . 
  germany and france should have more to say than others because they are more populated . 
  otherwise a german opinion would be less important than an opinion from a swede . 
  whoops . 
  ~ ~ so there are the most bears near the german border and literally zero bears in germany . 
  how ? ~ ~ never mind i ca n't read . 
  [ i think this is quite funny ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mzqtj3w.png ), 
  not really , our media just likes this image . 
  it 's such a shame we wo n't get gregor gysi as chancellor . 
  i hope die linke will get their shit together edit : whoops . 
  i thought about the wrong context . 
  they are the best in making money . 
  the one thing our whole capital world is about . 
  yes to the referendum = staying in the eu .

  [ can confirm , ready to fight for mother russia after this ] ( http://youtu.be/fbsxyllrmng ), 
  for the majority of german reddit users the great grandparents or even great great grandparents were the nazi generation . 
  just fyi . 
  i did n't mean that in a ' i wonder what would be if nazi germany won ' way . 
  more like a ' i wonder what would be if the ussr did n't annex the former east germany ' way . 
  what makes you think so ? 
  dresden was completely destroyed and it looks good today . 
  i ca n't recommend it often enough . 
  i would love to see what kind of city k\u00f6nigsberg be nowadays . 
  kind of like a mixture of berlin and hamburg i can imagine . 
  ` even more open ' all the information we have is via leaks . 
  wow , over one million in germany . 
  did n't expect that much . 
  wait , you are actually serious with `` those pesticides are sprayed on fruits and vegetables . 
  most people only eat that stuff 2 or 3 times per year , so they wo n't be exposed to a significant dose . '', 
  aww yeah . 
  our daily anti russia propaganda . 
  nah cdu is doing usual cdu stuff . 
  it 's pretty much only the spd that betrayes it 's voters . 
  the austrian president petted putin . 
  it 's something . 
  is n't the other type of partnership in germany pretty equal to a marriage just without the church ? 
  i completely agree . 
  i really like ` jedem das seine ' as ` everyone can do what he wants ' . 
  we are posting titles with memes now ?

  apparently the bundeswehr still uses [ this medal ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/bw_barettabzeichen_feldj%c3%a4ger.jpg ) which originates from this [ prussian medal ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/black_eagle_order_star.jpg ) . 
  what surprised me even more are the words `` suum cuique '' on the medal as `` jedem das seine '' does n't have the best associations after nazi-germany . 
  sadly , the prussian medal looks way cooler than this ugly modern thing . 
  do you think america is the most developed county in the world ? 
  you do n't need to be the most developed country to have the most influence . 
  we have invited a new word for people demonstrating against a infrastructure project ( stuttgard 21 ) tho . 
  why does germany have so much more participants than anybody else ? 
  but they have free wlan in their trains , so there is that . 
  not in germany tho . 
  germans hate investments into infrastructure nowadays . 
  we could stop delivering pizza to them .

  this is how you give all the power to the big newsletter agencies . 
  i think he meant russia is not interested in standing in front of berlin .

  patents in medicine led to south africa not being allowed to produce their own medicine against aids . 
  [ do n't worry , we got this ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ), 
  russians probably have better life conditions than many other east european inhibitants . 
  oh i just looked it up and its more like 40 $ -50 $ for late october . 
  i do n't know why i remembered 20 $ . 
  do you know a flight comparing site ? 
  i only know german ones , for example fluege.de . 
  this will show you almost every airline and get you the cheapest price . 
  i do n't thing you will have luck driving from norway to germany by car :d . also , its kind of hard to find international car sharing . 
  you can look for a flight , if you book early , you might get a pretty good price ( 20 $ -30 $ ) . 
  but i doubt a ferry/boat from norway to denmark and train/car to germany will be cheaper than a flight . 
  `` how thing are '' lies in the eye of the observer . 
  [ this one ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwarz-rot-gold#/media/file:image_germania_ ( painting \\ ) . jpg ), 
  i think that the sole defeating of germany has n't much to do with the modern german-american relationship . 
  it was more supply and help after the war ( marshall-plan ) . 
  that 's not up to me to decide . 
  if the people in charge of deciding that thinks he will do fine , i will be fine with that . 
  i want our eagle back on the flag :( . 
  the old one tho , he newer one is kind of fat . 
  i think he said `` russia never started a war against the west . '', 
  but just because ` you feel so ' should get a human into prison forever .
