  even if people sing the same language , the performance and/or the songs and music themselves have strong cultural ties . 
  if anything sharing your culture is now easier than before , because now we know what they want to tell us . 
  shitty songs is not the fault of the song-contest though ... and even before that ~ 90 % of the songs were ( and are ) trash . 
  same with women working or staying at home , depending where you live you can be cast out by society for choosing either . 
  hell alone in germany : if you live in the east you are expected to work as a mother , if you live in the south you are expected to stay at home , and people will look at you funny if you choose the opposite . 
  his brothers decided she should be married , he never had a say in that matter whatsoever . 
  i mean , they still exist , they are just not called that way here . 
  lots of murders are because a man felt `` hurt '' in his manliness and pride , because a woman did not accept his advances . 
  then this man uses violence to restore said `` manliness '' and `` pride '' . 
  and while not using violence , a lot of children ( of very conservative parents ) still face harsh punishments because they destroyed the `` good name of the family '' , by daring to be gay , or marrying someone the parents do n't like etc. 
  but yeah , killings are just not as usual within families , but more between abuse boyfriend/girlfriend . 
  man , after the nazi era you 'd think people would 've gotten smarter about `` protest voting '' , how did you think they got that many votes in the first place ? 
  `` be careful what you wish for , it might actually come true . '', 
  i mean , the baltics are further north than denmark , it has to count as something , right ? 
  martin could be a latin remnant though . 
  not every surname translates `` directly '' . 
  also the parisian french is fairly `` new '' ( iirc only became common with napoleon ) in general . 
  before that there were a bunch of different franko-germanic languages spoken within france . 
  do n't forget rising taxes for the poor and lowering them for the rich , together with the removal of minimum wage altogether . 
  the easiest way to understand them is , that putin 's russia is what they idolize ( and one reason they call the media `` lying press '' is because they make putin `` look bad '' , and rt speaks the truth ) . 
  have you looked at their party programme outside of the refugee stuff ? 
  if you did , then you 'd now that they 're pretty extremist . 
  points such as : * getting rid of minimum wage * forced labor instead of harz iv * taxes up for the poor , down for the rich * getting rid of alternative energy because the climate change `` does n't exist '' * media now under direct control of the ( afd ) government so that they ca n't `` lie '' anymore against them * all prayers of any religion have to be done in german * fixed ratio of german , `` patriotic '' songs in radio * getting rid of all tax-funded assisting tools for people to help them get work ( re-schooling , anti.barrier and inclusion laws etc. ), 
  * discriminating laws against lgbt-people ( oriented on the russian model ) basically : the afd is putin 's disciple . 
  they love him so much , they 'd suck his dick in a heartbeat ( no homo ) . 
  probably feminism happened . 
  women ( understandably ) did n't want to be nothing more than birthing machines for the men , confined to their homes for the rest of their lives . 
  add to this that the `` wirtschaftswunder '' ( economic miracle ) was starting to phase out at that point , meaning one man providing for a family of many children was getting more and more difficult . 
  add to this that the pill and the broader acceptance of condoms due to hiv later on made contraception super easy . 
  now much less children were born `` accidentally '' . 
  also : '68 was the high time of the generational conflict : the first post-war generation was now mature and they were fucking pissed at the old generation for beletteling their contribution to the nazi terrors ( ** i ** never shot anyone , ** i ** was against them etc. ), 
  while at the same time supporting america 's war efforts ( e.g. , by providing american bases in germany ) for the ( in their opinion ) inhumane vietnam war . 
  idk how much france had a hippie movement , but this conflict resulted with germany having a hippie movement just like the uk and the us did , even though the federal republic was never an active part in these armed conflicts . 
  i guess this conflict lead to a lot of youths refusing the values of the `` old '' generation , including having a family rich in children . 
  after that came the reunification and a collapse of births in the '90s in east germany ( as a single child now could easily cost your job and means of living , with no way out ) . 
  the only reason i am even alive today is simply because my mom was protected as a teacher and she already had my sister ( so another child would not be as bad as getting your first ) . 
  fun fact : the small `` even '' nodge in 1990 is called the `` wendeknick '' and the result of couples having sex due to the euphoria of the wall falling ... which rapidly declined after being faced with the reality of the brave new world . 
  climate change ? 
  great migrations ? 
  what 's that all about ? 
  i wonder if the designer of that one had a vore fetish ... 
  i loved what someone said in a commentary : `` it 's the next step of globalization . 
  first came the wares , then came the informational exchange , now the people come , we can not stop it without stopping globalization altogether . '', 
  we had this crisis coming to us and everything we did ( or are doing ) can only manage to push the time of the inevitable flood a little bit back . 
  but what do you expect , living in the richest planets on earth , extracting wealth from it 's neighboring nations , while barely adding to it , and the people are just gon na sit by and idly watch ? 
  some will rise up violently ( as seen in the islamic terrorism ) others want to join the wealth by any means possible ( as seen in the migration ) . 
  basically there is no reason for them to stay at home , there 's only poverty and misery for them there , while in europe there 's at least a `` dream '' ( no matter how unrealistic ) . 
  so if we want to keep them out , then we need to grant them opportunities in their own home countries . 
   in order to use the malware , government officials will have to get a ** court order ** , allowing authorities to hack into a citizen 's system . 
  the title implies that the state can ( legally ) spy on everyone with it , which is highly misleading . 
  ( not saying they wo n't do it regardless , but it 's still an important factoid ), 
  they are very nationalistic . 
  some points from the afd 's programme for sachsen-anhalt ( saxony-anhalt ) : * refuigees only get goods and no money , which sounds nice ( and the cdu/csu wants that too ) . 
  however it should be noted that just a few years ago we changed from a good-based to a money-based welfare , simply because a goods-based system is a bureaucratic nightmare ( every good has to be requested , accepted , delivered and handed out ) as well as never being on time ( need some diapers for your baby right the fuck now ? 
  wait 4 weeks and you may get a pack . ), 
  these diapers wo n't cost the state the pack of diapers , but the pack and all the bureaucracy behind it . 
  in a money based system you just give them the money and lean back and maybe look once in a while that they do n't just waste it . 
  much more convenient and cheaper for everyone involved , except of course `` concerned citizens '' . 
  * more focus in the nicer parts of german history ... sounds nice until you read that they simply belittle the nazi-era as `` unlucky years '' and that our iumage of it is `` other-directed '' by the victors . 
  * integration = assimilation . 
  migrants have to completely discard their own identity . 
  in other words : everything `` ungerman '' would be forbidden . 
  all prayers have to be done in german , hebrew or latin as these are part of the german history . 
  arabic , indian languages , japanese , chinese and other `` non-european '' prayers will be forbidden in return . 
  * `` patriotism '' lessons in school * more control of the state over the publicy funded media ( which they , ironically , claim to be state dictated , they want to control them more to have them only `` say the truth '' ) making them government controlled ( which , while funded by `` taxes '' , are not ) . 
  fixed amount of `` german '' broadcasts ( music and shows ) even in privately owned channels . 
  * want to introduce home-schooling , which pretty much every pedagogue agrees is a terrible idea , as it prevents children from coming into contact with different ideas , making them even more vulnerable to their parent 's indoctrination ( gee , i wonder what will be ? ) . 
  school is about more than just shoving facts into kid 's brain , it 's about making them mature and responsible members of society ( even stated in the law ) , home-schooling can not provide that and never will be able to . 
  * last but not least general belittling and disrespect of others : against the lgbt community , against migrants and what else you expect from far right parties , really . 
  so yeah , they are pretty fucking far right . 
  besides that being absolutely vile what you suggest here . 
  non-violent crimes should never ever result in violent responses , killing anyone in this regard is nothing short of a crime against humanity . 
  human rights are `` everyone or no one '' . 
  so either all get to marry , or the legal institution of marriage ( in terms of registration or tax breaks etc. ), 
  is abolished all together , both are fair . 
  however limiting marriage only to certain groups ( of humans being able to consent in a legal sense ) is against human rights . 
  iirc most people infected by aids are ethnic russians . 
  they make up ~ 1/3 of the population but 80 % of the hiv infected . 
  so yeah , russians ( wherever they are ) are being ravaged by hiv . 
  problem is that i ca n't find any ( english ) sources on that , it 's what an estonian guy told me , so it may be wrong , but it is indeed a problem a lot of the baltic nations share , and there is a high correlation between the rate of ethnic russians within their border and the hiv rate of the population . 
  trials in germany are `` free '' if you win , so not necessarily . 
  however if you lose you have to pay everything , so you can only lose or win nothing . 
  i mean , they are probably still miles better than most of the private outlets in the uk . 
  except that in most cases of missing teens that have been missing for less than 48h , they are just runaways/staying at a friend 's without calling their parents . 
  because , you know , teenagers and puberty 'n shit . 
  and 13-14y is where this shit is at it 's worst . 
  actually they were very good at piercing armor ... when you used balls of lead instead of stone ( so in a way : specialized `` anti-armor '' bullets ) . 
  iirc they found a roman corpse somewhere where a lead bullet penetrated his shield , through his armor and was then stuck somewhere in his chest . 
  add to this that the main purpose of missile weapons is to slow the enemy down , making him unable to charge or to properly brace against your own charge . 
  i mean , there is a reason the sling was the go-to missile weapon for most of the ancient world ( besides the javelin for close range missile attacks ) , even long after the bow was invented . 
  it was n't until the middle ages were the bow pretty much replaced the sling ( because of the invention of heavy war bows and war ammo such as the bodkin-arrow ) , but until then the slingshot had a good run for a few thousand years . 
  who knows , the slingshot could have been in use even longer , but since it is literally just a piece of cloth or leather , there is n't really much for archaeologists to discover , as well as for the people back then to preserve and due to it being a rather plain weapon it would n't be as prominent in paintings and other tellings . 
  it 's fun how germany 's different names all derive from different germanic tribes . 
  allemani\u00e9 , refers to the tribal confederation of the alemans ( which meant `` all men '' ) , while saksa ( or saksamaa in estonian ) refers to the saxons . 
  then there is germany for the germanic in general ( surprising that there is no `` keltonia '' or something ) . 
  and no one , except the germans seem to call germany `` deutschland '' ... most call the netherlands that way ( dutch -  dutchland -  deutschland ), 
  well , i mean poland is on the way to become a totalitarian regime , which in general threatens free market and in return the investments of many people . 
  you know , if there is one `` good '' thing about the german judicial system , then that money does n't matter as much as in other nations , due to the loser of a court battle having to pay for everything ( and normal citizens being able to get financial support to do just that ) . 
  they are unable to sue companies to the ground until the costs of the lawyers eats the smaller companies up ... as long as smaller companies keep winning , these court cases will be `` free '' for them , meaning they can face facebook & co for as long as possible . 
  this also means that the costs of lawyers in germany are more `` normalized '' in other words : the most expensive lawyers are not necessarily the best .
