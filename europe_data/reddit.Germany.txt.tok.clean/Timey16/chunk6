  also national socialist does n't work because it would mean the party is `` extreme right , but also extreme left '' , that 's like a catdog or an analogdigital clock . 
  it is impossible , as these two terms are mutually exclusive . 
  okay yeah rereading the [ source ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/interview-wersig100.html ) fo that claim narrows it down to : all rights concerning ** equalities in partnerships ** hat to be fought in by law . 
  they made two pakets , they knew they could n't get the whole equlity paket through the conservative dominatet bundesrat . 
  one paket contained all the duties of marriage and the second one all the rights . 
  the first paket got passed , the second blocked by cdu/csu . 
  now all these rights have to be demanded in the constitutional court . 
  you do n't even have to be pro gay-equaility to see the logic behind the court logic : ** same duties equals same rights ** . 
  if they do n't want gay people to have the same rights , then they should have less duties towrads the state , that would be fair as well . 
  every duty you have towards a state should directly translate to a right for you ( e.g. 
  the duty to pay taxes to the education system equals the right for free education ) . 
  yeah sorry , not willing is better . 
  like spd/gr \u00fcne , they introduced the low wage sector with agenda 2010 ( especially hartz iv ) , they could have easily introduce laws against this sort of wage dumping but noooo ... now that they 're opposition they are magically against their own ideas . 
  i wonder if we 'll ever get a minimum wage , even with them in power . 
  the sad thing is that a court had to order it . 
  even though more than 75 % of germans and the same amount of parlament were for it ( because a good portion of the conservative cdu were for it as well ) , but merkel ordered the `` official '' stance of the cdu/csu is against gay equality so it is now treated as if 100 % of the cdu csu is against it , and the fdp qould n't wo n't against their partners . 
  every single right we got ( e.g. 
  : right for provacy/protection of data ) was decided by the constitutional court . 
  not once , in the history of the federal republic , was any government able to increase the personal freedoms of the population on their own . 
  [ dual education system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual_education_system ) does not exist in uk . 
  ( yet ? ), 
  germany still has the quite unique system of apprentices , which are not unemployed ( as they earn money , though not lot ) . 
  so even if some numbers are cheated ( and i bet they are ) : they would still be better than the european average . 
  does it matter ? 
  i hate it when everything becomes a contest . 
  the main point : the more secular a country , the more homosexuality is accepted . 
  nl is a secular nation , so you can bet that homosexuality is quite accepted . 
  your faucet water is n't the only source to drinking water . 
  you can always buy bottled water , and in worst case drink lake/river/rain water . 
  ( also most food has lots of water in it as well ) so no , you would n't die if they cut of your water and if you do , you would be too stupid to live as you need to get your water cut off in the first place , which is impossible if you know anything about money and budget . 
  it would more be of an inconvinience . 
  also we were kind of forced into it , because the allied only wanted to negotiate a ceasefire with a democratically elected government or something . 
  the weimar republic in its entirety was kind of forced open the germans , thats another reason why it was so unstable in the first place . 
  yeah i figured people were overexeggerating , but he seems very autoritharian nonethelsess . 
  i huess the biggest problem was/is that they want to take away rights for the constitutional court ? 
  i mean really dumb shit would be stopped by them , but then not anymore . 
  i ca n't find an english source right now ( sorry ) . 
  but this week the human rights report 2013 from amnesty international was released ... and it looks really bad for hungary there . 
  it looks like orban is trying to establish a dictature there . 
  it also calls out for the eu to do more that this will not happen ( they should consider sanctions ) . 
  also the eu was called out for being directly responsible for the drowning refugees in the mediterranean sea . 
  because if left wing group attacks ( burning stuff ) get branded a `` terrorist '' attack , then violent attacks ( usually right wing crimes ) by `` white folks '' get branded `` hate crimes '' at best , they have to be really big to be accepted as terrorist attacks . 
  if theres one thing i know about police , then that they tend to be rather `` blind on the right eye '' , not necessarily the individual officer , but the law enforcement system as a whole . 
  just look at the nsu mess in germany , were police never considered these 8 murders as hate crime , but linked all of them to gang-related violence . 
  5,000 spaniards ** per year ** . 
  also it seems that spain is interested in introducing the german [ dual education system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual_education_system ) themselves . 
  having students learn in germany will give spain a first hand experience in how it works and where the pros and cons are , it would make the introduction of that system more seamless and it would work effeciantly faster ( as educational reforms can take more than a decade to actually show any effect ) . 
  yeah i have heard nothing but opposition in terms of euro from him , for the exact same reasons why we have the crisis now . 
  now helmut kohl , that would be the german euro founder ( who is also at fault for completly fucking up the reunification , but is still celebrated as the chancellor od the reunion ) man sometimes it seems oskar was too honest for his own good . 
  pickle ( in german ) is still gurke , though it is rather known as a `` essiggurke '' ( vinegar cucumber ) or `` eingelegte gurke '' ( pickled cucumber ) . 
  a `` pickle '' does not seem to exist as its own vegetable , it is more of a short term of `` pickled cucumber '' . 
  what you also tend to forget : the majority of these people do n't want to get rid of their monarchs ... also the yearly costs of monarchies are rather low ( even 100 mil . 
  $ p.a. 
  wouldn ' be that much ) . 
  much more is wasted on stupid shit like `` prestige '' projects nobody cares about . 
  these monarchs at least seem to give the country a certain feeling of community . 
  and they are a source of income for all these gossip magazines . 
  well queen elizabeth ii . 
  does not seem to be a waste but actually a source of [ income ] ( http://youtu.be/bhyygnhhkfw ) . 
  it seems this time germany voted for it . 
  maybe because it 's just a 2 y. ban . 
  as heartless as it sounds : about time . 
  austerity doe n't bring anything if it does not come with a big structural reform to actually get rid of the reasons the country went into debt in the first place . 
  and one of the reasons greece is in debt is the heavily inflated public sector . 
  greece just ca n't continue to employ these hordes of state employees , there are just too many of them ( hell , too many employees can actually decrease efficency as the indivifual ones may not be challenged enough and become bored , thus decreasing their concentration during work ) . 
  also the structural reform would include a reform in working procedure ( to deal with the decreased numbers ) , but that is not the topic right now . 
  though i feel sorry for those who are getting laid off , as they will have incredible difficulties finding a job in the private sector . 
  they will be unemployed for a long time . 
  on a related note : what does greece do to attract private businesses ? 
  smart ? 
  yes a diplomat ? 
  hell no !, 
  nooooooo !, 
  not the chocolate !, 
  as far a i know ss members were not conscripted ( as the ss were the ones who operatd the camps ) . 
  the ss was considered as the absolute elite of the german `` race '' so conscription does not make sense . 
  the only exception was at the end of the war for the waffen-ss ( the combat unit of the ss ) , however afaik they did not operate the camps . 
  german economy is based on export , so german growth depends on the growth of the rest of the world . 
  also most export goes to other countries within the eu . 
  as they are hit by austerity and the crisis , they import less from germany and thuis lowering german export . 
  ( which also proves the bullshit argument that germany wants to keep greece , spain , cyprus etc. 
  down to ensure its power ... economically weak eu partners would mean less export and less money for us . ), 
  drug addicts are n't as criminalized here as in the us . 
  you usually do not get sent to prison when high . 
  they will only sue you , when you have such a high amount of drugs , that they suspect you have the intention to sell them ( at least in germany ) ~ ~ also vienna is pretty safe because the costs of living there are redicously high ... crack heads could n't afford to live there . ~ ~ god dammit i always replace vienna with venecia in english, 
  one quartal , less than one percent . 
  one quartal with such a low rate can hardly be considered a `` trend '' . 
  also on a related note : constant growth does not exist and is simply physically impossible , growth also does not reflect the wellbeing of the general population . 
  at one point it jast has to come to a halt and slow down or reverse and go into a recession . 
  actually they do . 
  some states have different holidays than others e.g. 
  the `` reformtionstag '' were martin luther nailed his thesis on the church door is a holiday in some states but not e.g. 
  in bavaria the `` bu\u00df und bettag '' however is a holiday in bavaia but not in e.g. 
  northern germany . 
  but for that we would need eu-parties first , which also put the eu 's interest first ... would n't really help much if the members of these eu parties put their country first . 
  agenda 2010 ... we had ( andcontinue to have ) austerity for the last 10 years . 
  while wages in europe went up , germany 's wages went down ( last year was the first year in that period were average wages actually went up again ) . 
  pensions were decreased and the low wage sector was ( if unintentionally ) introduced . 
  however the austerity `` kind '' of worked , because it came with strucural reforms which are meant to rebuild things like public service to work as effecient as before , even with less money as available ( so you can call that part more of a consolidation than austerity ) . 
  that is ( for my understanding ) what is missing in greece , spain etc.
