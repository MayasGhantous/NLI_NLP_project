   she keeps making deals on behalf of the entire eu , like with the recent china deals no , that is not true , thats actually quite impossible as it is illegal for her to make deals for the eu itself . 
  what china deals has she made for the eu ? 
   did n't know that i , as a danish citizen , had to be influenced by merkel and her decisions . 
  do n't try to paint merkel as the big boogeyman who is responsible for all your problems . 
  yes , you are influenced by her and germany as a whole , but so is germany from denmark and other eu nations , because thats what the eu is . 
  the eu is a political and economic union of european nations that binds us together . 
  just look at how far you 've strayed form your initial claims and topics . 
  now , you are just blindly accusing merkel of being the root of all the bad things that are happening in europe , while trying to paint her as some sort of european dictator . 
  i do n't know who you 're trying to convince here , me or you . 
  memes and jokes aside , i am in favor of a real , more active german military for many reasons . 
  first off , i believe that this is our responsibility , but not because of any supposed guilt over the past . 
  the past is the past , it happened , we should n't forget it , but we also should n't let it dictate our lives and actively hinder our safety . 
  i believe that doing more in ensuring europe 's security is our responsibility , because we are one of the founding members of the eu , we are the biggest nation in terms of population and therefore hold significant power in the eu 's institutions and worldwide , we have many international connections and we have much money aswell as the strongest industry of europe which would help this significantly . 
  the main problem here is not really guilt over wwii as many believe , its that many people simply do n't care , and these people would rather have us to take the route of pacifism and neutrality , kind of like switzerland , but we simply are too big to take a back seat and do nothing in every situation . 
  merkel did n't say this title is clickbait, 
  i do n't know what that has to do with merkel allegedly * wanting more refugees * , bur sure , i 'll bite . 
  since when is merkel chancellor or europe ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  why are the refugees of other eu countries merkels responsibility ? 
  why is it surprising that the chancellor of germany only creates policies for germany ? 
  like ... what ? 
  well , we have more and better fighter jets , and while you have more tanks , we have more modern ones and a stronger industry , capable of quickly replacing lost tanks . 
  edit : replaced fighters with fighter jets , since i only now realized that fighter also means soldier, 
   actually we 'd prefer to be left alone to deal with our own teutonic messes i do n't . 
  i 'd welcome it if germany would take more responsibility when it comes to defense of europe and the world . 
  sure it 'd be nice if we could just live in peace and pacifism , like the neutrality of the swiss for example , but germany is simply too big to be left alone . 
  i do n't like the whole `` lets just take a backseat and do nothing '' attitude . 
  well first off [ merkel herself has admitted that her refugee policy was a mistake ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-iduskcn1152iu ) and has vowed at the same time that this would n't happen again and that the [ refuge germany is giving is only temporary ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12132657/merkel-warns-asylum-seekers-that-german-refuge-is-temporary.html ) . 
  after this she presented a [ 16 point plan to increase deportations ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/angela-merkel-will-zahl-der-abschiebungen-mit-16-punkte-plan-erhoehen-a-1133615.html ) . 
  i could only find a reliable german source , but basically the important points are , that it shortens the time of the deportation process , commissions the creation of deportation centers that coordinate mass deportations and are allowed to detain refugees before they are deported , which again is made easier as police are allowed to detain and monitor denied asylum seekers more easily . 
  at the same time , money for those that return willfully is increased . 
  also merkel and the cdu have made , and are still making [ deals with north african states to take in refugees that want to move to europe in exchange for money ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-wants-refugee-migration-deals-with-northern-african-countries-migrants-migration-turkey/ ) . 
  also the bundestag has recently [ passed a law which increases methods of the police to detain , monitor and deport refugees that are either deemed a threat , or have failed their plea for asylum ] ( https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/clamping-down-on-asylum-768807 ) . 
  should i go on ? 
  should i show how the cdu is going against criticisms of islamization ? 
  or how about you , why do n't you show me some sources proving the opposite ? 
  you do know that the union party ( cdu/csu ) has recently taken harsh anti refugee stances right ? 
  but who cares about about facts when we have confirmation bias . 
  this does n't seem accurate , with parties such as the greens , afd and the left . 
  this is only a forecast model so its fine i guess . 
  you did n't read the article did you ? 
  you just read the headline and thought `` now is the time for an edgy comment ! '', 
  yeah , i can see it, 
  `` this video is not available in your country '' well . 
  not really surprised . 
  did someone say gas shipment to poland ? 
   if we speak about europe , we alienated him before he even became a president no , i meant that he alienated europe . 
  many people here were willing to work with him , if he 'd show a bit restraint , but now , european leaders are just abandoning the thought of productive cooperation and respect . 
   so let 's not overdramatize with this falling off a cliff i merely used that analogy to show that , while his plan may have worked , it only did thanks to him making things worse , and it probably has more downsides than upsides . 
   why could n't we put priority on our defense before some jerk from the other side of the atlantic ocean told us to do it we never really had a reason to . 
  europe had acceptable armies , we had nato , there was no major threat and america liked having a strong military presence everywhere . 
  people believed that since this system worked , there was no reason to change it . 
   these plans you can read about recently sound really good . 
  on that we can agree . 
  i really like countries like germany and france wanting to take more responsibility . 
  i do n't know about others , but i know that germany is ramping up military spending and merkel has said that the us is no longer a reliable ally , and that europe needs to take its fate into its own hands . 
  then , sure , it * worked * , but why and at what cost ? 
  its not because trump is a master negotiator , or that european countries took his `` advice '' to heart , its because he is unreliable and unpredictable , and because they do n't like him . 
  sure , they will be a lot more self reliant now , but this is also bad for the us , because now he has alienated his most important partners . 
  saying his plan worked , is like saying you have a fast car , because its falling off a cliff . 
  its true , in a way , but not really good for the parties involved . 
  well that 's because the 2 % was n't fully binding to begin with , it was more of a guideline to ensure that everyone is doing enough , which these countries thought they were doing , and since then , no one has really pressured them . 
  now i do n't know about other countries , but i know that merkel has , thanks to the pressure , vowed to meet the 2 % guideline , and is already increasing military budget . 
  i 'd guess he is polish . 
  basically everyone i know is in favor of a eu army, 
  [ here is a summary of the 2014 nato summit where the 2 % goal was announced . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm ) its at point 14 . 
  here :  allies whose current proportion of gdp spent on defence is below this level [ 2 % ] will :  - halt any decline in defence expenditure ;  - aim to increase defence expenditure in real terms as gdp grows ;  - aim to move towards the 2 % guideline within a decade the important part is ** aim to move towards the 2 % guideline within a decade ( 2024 ) ** which all the accused countries are doing . 
  thats the thing , everyone is paying their fair share , but the president of the united states apparently ca n't be bothered to actually read the documents he is referring to . 
  this is n't a trade deal though, 
  i think poland is overrated, 
  yep . 
  i always pictured germanys flag [ as a sunset ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xa3n6up.jpg ) but fire is cool too, 
  first off his sister perverting his work , and because he has a lot of small sentences that sound really cool and edgy as out of context instagram captions , but do n't reflect his actual views . 
  which translates to  `` if we ca n't solve the central problems of the african states , in ten years 10 , 20 or even 30 million immigrants may come to the eu '' there is a difference between `` the eu ** expects ** 30 million immigrants '' and `` one person fears that ** perhaps up to 30 million ** will come , ** if we wont act ** '' , which is a huge difference . 
  reading comprehension is an important skill . 
   why enforcing the borders would be illegal completely closing the borders would be illegal since , at least , our constitution grants these people the right to asylum that however was not the point i was trying to make . 
  my point was that it would be stupid , and that the german government is working on securing our borders . 
   and ngo 's picking up migrants at 5 miles from the lybian coast is n't illegal ? 
  and how are they supposed to prevent that ? 
  have military patrol the area and shoot boats down ? 
   for the next decade eu is expecting 30 million illegal migrants no , stop lying . 
  the highest amount predicted was 6.6 million . 
  and again , at least read my entire comment before replying , since this does n't have to do with anything . 
   should they all come in ? 
  not what i said stop trying to escalate this , you look like an idiot . 
   when are we going to stop the flooding of migrants ? 
  first off , what does that have to do with this ? 
  could you at least stay on topic ? 
  second off , you make it seem like we could do this with the push of a button , which is not the case . 
  the eu ** is ** doing its best to stop the mass migration . 
  but they are taking measures to protect out borders though . 
  first off , to get that out of the way , they ca n't * close * the borders , because that would be against the law , and very stupid . 
  what would happen after the borders closed ? 
  do you think all the people coming here would just turn around and go home ? 
  no , those are desperate people who mostly no longer have homes and have already gone a long way , so they would either find other ways in , like smuggling for example , stay there and grow even more desperate , and finally , many would try to force their way in . 
  then we 'd have the invasion so many people fear . 
  there are however other ways to secure our borders , which merkel is doing . 
  the balkanroute , which was a popular route for refugees , has been closed , and merkel has made , or is making , several deals with african countries to take in a lot of the coming refugees before they arrive in europe . 
  do n't pretend like she is doing absolutely nothing .
