  well , we are a pragmatic people , and pragmatic people like order . 
   if you are willing to use military to stop it yes , sure we could use our military to keep immigrants out and contained , but how much would that actually bring in the long run ? 
  the people coming here are desperate and have already gone a long way , they wo n't just turn around and leave , they would find other ways or try to force their way in to the point where the military would have to intervene aggressively , which would surely lead to many controversies . 
  even then how would that all look ? 
  how many people do you think would jump at the chance to use nazi parallels and hate on our country and military , who are now using brute military force against civilians , in order to keep them in camps , or in their war torn countries ? 
  there is already much hostility against germany and our military in the world , and this wold just give them an excuse to jump at us , and try to make our lives miserable . 
  why do n't you , you know , read the article, 
  `` it is with great reluctance that i have agreed to this calling . 
  i love democracy , i love the republic . 
  the power you give me , i will lay down when this crisis has averted . '', 
  prequel memes aside , the title is kind of wrong , as this only extends the emergency status which is already in place , and does n't add anything , which is understandable considering what happened in manchester . 
  this is just to keep people safe . 
  and fidget spinners , the emoji movie , and the minions . 
  you do know street gangs are a big problem in the us , to the point where the police has specific branches to combat these gangs right ? 
  you do know that in the us gangs have tattoos openly showing which gang they belong to and even control entire areas , right ? 
  title misleading there was no fierce rap battle between hungary and the parliament, 
  well martin schulz has n't said anything specific concerning plans , i think , but he has praised europes tolerance when dealing with immigrants and has called for more integration of migrants as well as legal ways to immigrate , yet also for stricter surveillance of immigration processes . 
  merkel however has taken a more critical stance on immigration admitting that the eu was not fully prepared for all the immigrants and has recently published plans to strengthen deportation , with a focus on mass deportations and quicker refusal of migrants who are not eligible to stay . 
  * erika plays in the distance and slowly intensifies *, 
  like how le pen always visited putin ? 
   uk = us 's greatest ally  germany = still nazis [ wat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yplh18u.png ), 
   well you 're ignoring me saying that its a hypothetical i 'm not , i already told you that my point was that germany would not be unprepared in a war against the uk . 
   germany currently doenst have any missile defense system whatsoever germany has the patriot defense system , used by its flugabwehrraketengeschwader 1 ( anti air missle squadron 1 ) and by us troops stationed in germany ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mim-104_patriot#current_operators )  in a war with one side having nukes and the other doesnt you only need to look towards ww2 japan and the us . 
  this is a completely different situation , as the atomic bomb was something completely new , used after years of fighting . 
  you ca n't compare these situations in any way . 
   that 'd mean they would hit berlin in about 3-5 minutes . 
  germany also has defense systems against nuclear weapons , and , again , a very good chance for nuclear reataliation . 
   this is a pointless argument because you 're arguing hypothericals which you cant be worked out in advance if its working out relationships between countries . 
  yeah , but my point is , that germany would definitely not be unprepared in the case of an atomic strike . 
   us could just as easily side with the uk not when the uk 's first action would be to prepare nuclear weapons , since even the us would understand the gravity of such an action . 
  the uk would most likely first find some sort of justification to launch nukes , declare war and prepare them , and germany has one of the largest uranium enrichment factories , already produced rocket parts for france and britian , and has the capabilities to launch nuclear weapons , so even if they would n't get persmission by the us and had no way of using the nukes otherwise , they could still produce a nuclear deterrent on their own in a very short time . 
  well germany definitely has the capabilities to launch the nukes , as this is stated in the nuclear sharing policy of nato . 
  the degree of control the german government has over the nukes , meaning wether or not they need the us 's strict permission is kind of ambiguous as neither the german government nor its military like to talk about the nukes , but its very likely that they need the us 's permission . 
  however if britian goes so crazy that they 'd fire nukes immediately , germany would definitely get permission to use theirs . 
  probably should 've phrased that better , but well , as part of the nuclear sharing of nato , germany must always be ready to use nuclear weapons , so they definitely have the capability.now if britian goes so crazy that they 'd fire nukes immediately , germany would definitely get permission to use theirs . 
  britian would probably first need a justification to use nukes , and authorize it which would take time , and considering germanys industry , the fact that they have one of the largest uranium enrichment factories and already produced parts for france and britian , aswell as the fact that they have the capabilities to launch nuclear weapons , they could produce a nuclear deterrent in a very short time . 
  yeah , but if britian goes so crazy that they 'd immediately fire nuclear weapons , then germany would definitely get permission to use theirs . 
  i really do n't know why i find these so incredibly funny also [ a l w a y s r e a d y ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9mdeyy6.png ), 
  again , germany has nuclear weapons , sure they 're technically owned by the us , but they are on german military bases with the means to launch them and are operated by german personell , and germany is allowed to use them when necessary . 
  if the uk launches 100 warheads to germany , then they 'll will just launch the us nukes right back and everyone dies . 
  the point about germany having the means to build nuclear weapons was that germany can use the us nukes as a deterrent , while quickly building their own arsenal . 
  germany has nuclear weapons from the us on some of their bases , and should things escalate to war , they could very easily seize complete control of these weapons . 
  even without that they have everything they need to build nuclear weapon themselves , and with germanys advanced industry , they could do so in a very short time . 
   the strongest german army in history could n't overtake the uk even when usa and russia germanys expansion was only focussed on land . 
  hitler wanted to take out france first , and then move on to britian should it be necessary . 
  fun fact : hiter did n't want to fight with britian , he wanted to make peace with them . 
  he actually sent one of his most trusted advisers ( forgot his name ) over to secure a peace deal , but the guy was locked up and ignored . 
  edit : i found some more information on the peace deals with england . 
  a diary from chief of staff halder , a nazi ofiicer , mentioned that hitler still believed in 1940 , that england would make peace with them . 
  he also hoped that british troops would help him take france . 
  he actually made several peace offers to england , in which they would only need to restore some former german colonies to end fighting . 
  hitler had a great respect for the british empire and said that `` when we destroy the english military , the british empire will collapse , but germany will not profit from that . '', 
  all of the peace deals were rejected though . 
  third times the charm right :d, 
   the american system is the best in the world then how are the [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8cssn4w.jpg ) two [ people ] ( http://i.imgur.com/locxgoq.jpg ) the most qualified to lead the country ? 
   i am not trolling . 
  i think there are two ways you can debate , one way is to come with reasonable arguments and try to change my mind , and the other is to just throw insults . 
  well if you truly wanted to start a good conversation , then you would n't have begun like a sarcastic asshole , but rather with something like : * `` everyone is acting as if this is a new chapter for europe , but i do n't see how this will save the eu in the long run . 
  i actually think that the eu is doomed to fail , and recent events like brexit , or the fact that le pen even made it this far is an indicator of that . 
  what do you think ? 
  '' * now you have made your position clear , while also posing a question that others can answer . 
   just wondering if you are at all critical of merkel and the european union ? 
  ok , so first off i do n't fully support merkel in some decisions , since she is usually hesitant to make drastic actions against people like erdogan after the nazi remarks , but this thoughtfulness has helped us in many situations . 
  there is a reason that merkel has been in office for so long , and that is because she has experience and knows how to lead , and germany has prospered in the last few years , with the highest export surplus we ever had , the fact that unemployment has basically been halved and is at an all time low and that the political situation is very stable . 
  similar things can be said about the eu . 
  both merkel and the eu have faults , but they are the best we have , and they do their job well . 
   because you can not go outside late evenings or nights as a woman , and you could do this 15 years ago . 
   these terrorist waves that has happened in both yours and my countries , and specially france , there needs to be politics that actually puts the foot down againat this . 
  now , i ca n't speak for sweden , but i 've lived my whole life in germany , and i can safely say that things here have not really changed . 
  germany has had about 81 million people at the beginning of the refugee crisis , and about 2 million people have made their way to germany . 
  even if all of them stayed ( spoiler : definitely not true , and a lot of people are still being deported ) they would only make a minor difference in germanys demographic , but i know that many people still like to say we are being `` replaced '' , which is just not true . 
  crime has slightly risen by a few percent , yes , but nothing that the state/police ca n't handle , and i can safely say that people can walk around at night safely . 
  talking about `` rape epidemics '' and `` terrorist waves '' is greatly exaggerated , at least in germany , as most extremist attacks are prevented before they happen , and the few that do happen , like the truck or cologne ( i guess ) are again greatly exaggerated by the media , and only short term consequences . 
   not liberal and left leaning politics that makes it easier for these kinds of sick fundamentalists and rapists to continue people like macron and merkel do not * make it easier * for terrorism to happen , what gave you that idea ? 
  macron himself has said that france and the eu must act fast and strengthen our borders , while also improving inner security , since `` terrorism wants to destroy europe '' , so he absolutely knows about the terrorist threat and wants to put his foot down . 
  even merkel has said that she wants to strengthen inner security and that `` germany will never come to terms with terrorism '' , and the state has already founded a new anti-terror organisation after what happened in paris , and made plans about stricter surveillance and more . 
  i really do n't know where you get your information from , that you 'd think that these people wo n't do something against terrorism . 
   you did n't do europe a favor  you killed your own country  the eu will only live a few more years   he says you 're a retard for believing that  wow personal attacks  wow , so thats how you treat us  wow so hateful you should be ashamed it is ... as if ... you 're trolling :0, 
  i 'm gon na enjoy the tears of / pol / and the_d for the next few days :d, 
  you 're right , they do n't , thats why he asked if you were serious and called you on your bullshit . 
   germany 's defence minister says veneration for hitler 's armed forces has no place in the modern german army alright then , looks like we can no longer say that people like stauffenberg and his compatriots like witzleben and beck were heroes since they were all part of the wehrmacht . 
  also looks like we have to rename a bunch of barracks like the one named after rommel , all because some barracks kept ** legal ** memorabilia like helmets and medals . 
  its just things like rifles , medals , helmets and photographs and not illegal things , like swastikas or propaganda . 
  the memorabilia in the baracks does not go against the law . 
  the funny thing is , that this is actually the complete opposite . 
  its because of the competition that capitalism creates , and germanys history , customs and infrastructure are perfectly suited to create the individuality and ingenuity of model capitalist companies . 
  but you probably did n't even read the article , you probably do n't even know what capitalism and communism really are . 
  you just saw a headline containing `` germany '' and `` jobs '' and felt the need to spread the sad , messed up fantasy world , made up simply by breitbart and / pol / , that you spun up by in your moms basement . 
  all i can say is do n't worry , hang in there , it does get better in high school . 
  germany was antagonized by the whole world and razed to the ground a little more than 70 years ago , and now its one of the most influential economic and political nations in the world . 
  germany has survived worse than a refugee crisis inflated by people who use it to spread panic , or just sound important . 
  why does this look like a meme to me * `` very fast policeman fighting crime at incredible hihg speed '' *, 
  nah , our champion has a slingshot . 
  the polish guy can twirl around all he wants , but in the end [ range always wins ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kxtorua.gifv ),

  divide and conquer would be us trying to force northern ireland into a united ireland , by threatening them for instance , and then invading england while its divided , and i 'm * pretty sure * that thats not going to happen . 
  learn what divide and conquer is , before accusing the eu of it , when they are simply telling them that they will always be welcome .
