in economics , inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time . 
  when the general price level rises , each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services . 
  consequently , inflation also reflects an erosion in the purchasing power of money -- a loss of real value in the internal medium of exchange and unit of account in the economy . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inflation ) money printed to shovel into ~ ~ bank balance sheets ~ ~ * paying off debts * does n't just disappear there . 
  it feeds the money supply and can cause inflation if there are no strong contrary factors . 
  also , [ hyperinflation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperinflation#root_causes_of_hyperinflation )  by definition , hyperinflation is a rapid increase in price index ( the money supply multiplied by the velocity of money ) without a corresponding increase in real output ( see equation of exchange ) . 
  this is often caused by decisions on the part of the central bank to increase the money supply much more than markets had previously expected , often when money is printed to finance government spending . 
  oh , and `` the goods/supply are all ready out there in the economy . '', 
  is quite a big statement without evidence . 
  my statement `` printing money has many effects ( especially on consumers/workers ) and is not the save-all solution that pays debts . '', 
  is not a straw man but a fact . 
  your country has high inflation ? 
  what will you do ? 
  you will try your best to switch to another currency as soon as you can in order not to lose money . 
  4.4 % is ridiculously high and , worse , will cause a devaluation of the currency , which makes more people jump ship . 
  btw . 
  the debt/gdp ratio in the uk is 79.9 % , germany 83.2 % - not much of a difference . 
  if you state `` numbers '' and argue with them please check them first . 
  on dunning-kruger : i just become wary of someone claiming to know more than the people most involved in the issue ( e.g. 
  trichet or now draghi ) and it should ring alarm bells whenever you believe to know something better than people who spend their whole day working on those issues . 
  your link does n't work for me ... but either way , i said nearly the same thing above : `` the uk has by far the highest deficit and one of the highest total debts and debt/gdp ratios in the eu . '', 
  further , the uk has by far the highest foreign debt in the eu ( 400 + % ) : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15748696 but either way , this is not a matter of `` you are worse than me '' . 
  they all stand badly and should work to fix it . 
  i still do n't see why there is so much outrage against nuyer 's comparison : on many measures the uk stands worse than france . 
  the uk is dependent on the financial industry and has a very weak services and even weaker manufacturing sector . 
  that is , the whole economy stands on a risky footing while france at least has some services and manufacturing left . 
  the inflation and weak growth are another hefty blow that the populace will feel pretty soon ... 
  um , for me this utterance is very clearly not a call for a downgrade . 
  further , remember that this was an interview so he did not necessarily plan his words 200 days in advance . 
  my point was that the title is misleading , which it is . 
  if it seems too easy and the experts do n't agree with you . . then of course they must be wrong . 
  printing money has many effects ( especially on consumers/workers ) and is not the save-all solution that pays debts . 
  further , the eurozone could print money ( but only jointly ) if they wanted to . 
  there also is a reason that central banks are indpendent from government : else the government could always just make more and more debts and then shift the cost ( through printing money ) and other negative effects on the citizens . 
  that 's what will ensure that no government ever lives within its budget . 
  administrative paralysis is not really a good reason for downgrading . 
  ratings are supposed to mirror the chance of a loan being paid back - that can even happen with administrative paralysis since that is generally temporary , but not if debt increases as rapidly as in the uk ( highest deficit in the eu , see discussion above ) in that context it might be worth remembering that probably all of us in this thread combined know much less about economics and the system than trichet or noyer [ but we believe to be know-it-alls because we do n't see the whole system ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning%e2%80%93kruger_effect ) . 
  so , well , i think they probably get the finance thing quite well . 
  printing money leads to inflation : the government prints money while the total value of all currency in use stays roughly the same . 
  thus , the government essentially shifts some of the value from the money in circulation and gives this value to the new currency . 
  essentially , you can think of it as a tax on savings - but it also hits incomes , which usually is worse . 
  well , the uk has the second highest inflation rate in the eu . 
  uk : 4.4 % , eurozone : 2.7 % . 
  that 's quite a big difference - and the german inflation angst might be the reason why one main reason why the euro-inflation is not higher . 
  roughly : the downgrade is not justified if you look at the economic fundamentals . 
  or else they should start/continue by downgrading the uk which has higher deficit , a similar amount of debt , more inflation , ... that is a conditional or a hypothetical form and not an ought or should . 
  you are wrong : the uk is part of the bailout . 
  not through the efsf , but through the [ efsm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_financial_stabilisation_mechanism ) and in some other ways too . 
  the uk has by far the [ highest deficit ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=edp_b9_mio_eur&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country_group&amp;idim=country_group:non-eu&amp;idim=country:bg:dk:de:ee:fi:fr:gr:ie:it:lv:lt:lu:mt:nl:at:pl:pt:ro:se:sk:si:es:cz:hu:uk:cy:be&amp;ifdim=country_group&amp;tstart=818982000000&amp;tend=1292367600000 ) and one of the highest total debts and debt/gdp ratios in the eu . 
  thus the uk actually is in very big trouble - and what the central banker said is exactly that . 
  what he * did not * say is that the uk * should * be downgraded - that is a purely sensationalist guardian-headline . 
   noyer told le telegramme newspaper that a downgrade for france -- which would drive up the interest paris pays to borrow and make loans in the wider economy more expensive -- `` does n't strike me as justified based on economic fundamentals '' . 
   `` or if it is , they should start by downgrading the uk , which has a bigger deficit , as much debt , more inflation , weaker growth and where bank lending is collapsing , '' he added . 
  he was making a comparison , saying that the uk stands worse off then france . 
  that is not a call for a uk downgrade . 
  the problem is , when the things are signed ( in march ) you essentially have to legal areas , partly overlapping , partly not . 
  how do you legislate further ? 
  everything the eu does will have to be compatible with eu and neweu law . 
  so the only - long-term - solutions are that either one of the groups dies off , or they merge . 
  if they merge obviously cameron would have lost , and since the neweu would have the stronger financial regulation it could n't be the one to die off . 
  ergo - in the long-term it seems he either has to give up and accept new regulation or leave the eu . 
  i think your analogy does n't hold at all . 
  but either way , i think the problem is a completely different one : cameron ( rightly ) fears that the new club , whatever might be its name , will simply replace the eu in its current form . 
  it takes over the institutions and one day britain wo n't have much of a say or just slowly falls out of the system if it does n't follow suit . 
  i think though he fears the wrong thing . 
  what would be much worse for the uk would be if a new set of institutions are drawn up , which then compete with the eu . 
  since any country 's veto can stop eu legislation it would just need one or two countries each time , to stop any eu action and then follow up with a new action by the new eu ( neu ? ) . 
  this scenario would be much worse for those who stay out , because they wo n't have much of a chance to join in later - and if they do it , they will have lost a lot of ground . 
  tl ; dr cameron should * hope * that they use current eu institutions instead of those being castrated and replaced by a completely new system without a british say . 
  i think bad ideas are better than no ideas , yes . 
  why ? 
  because bad ideas can still be reshaped and changed when they are seen as not good or not good enough . 
  `` no ideas '' stay nonexistent . 
  by the way , give this a read : http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/dec/08/europeanbanks-conservatives?newsfeed=true lord oakshott :  the idea that in the worst crisis in a generation our top priority for our prime minister today is to protect the fat cats in the city is extraordinary . 
  there 's not much of a threat . 
  there 's some perfectly sensible proposals about more transparency and better corporate government in hedge funds which are perfectly reasonable . 
  you do need some supra-national regulation . 
  british regulations on their own have n't proved a great success in the past . 
  cameron is banging the drum because it 's a simple scare to do -- and many of the tory donors are in the city . 
  richard murphy , tax research uk :  [ the proposed european legislation ] is about accountability and transparency and making sure that people pay their taxes . 
  it 's about effective markets . 
  why are they trying to maintain the status quote which is so flawed ? 
  demanding a hedge fund is run , regulated and taxed in the same place is right . 
  this is not being anti-market ; it 's arguing for a good market . 
  the `` verdict '' of the author :  is the city really under threat from europe ? 
  yes . 
  the financial regulations being implemented and considered in europe are largely a response to the last financial crisis and measures such as a financial transactions tax , the reform of short-selling and hedge-funds are all designed to create more responsible behaviour in all the major financial centres . 
  the banks certainly see that as a threat to them ; it is supposed to be . 
   whether the response is proportional or not depends on the faith you have in the city and whether you want to protect , control or punish it . 
  and a quote that ends the article , from a german newspaper :  ** but the british do n't just want to stop the financial transaction tax that merkel wants . 
  they want to withdraw from already established european banking regulation and would n't even accept the new basel-iii rules for credit institutions . 
  ** these plans would create nothing less than a british special zone in the eu , where precisely the unregulated speculation that merkel wants to stop , would continue . 
  i think the british are missing one important point , summed up nicely here :  `` the city of london is very important , and the eu has some bad ideas for regulating it . '', 
  the point is : the eu might have some bad ideas for regulating the city . 
  but britain on its own has no power to even * have any ideas * to regulate the city . 
  the politicians are property of the city of london , they say so openly and act accordingly . 
  the finance sector will go on with its destruction of the british economy - and the brits keep celebrating them like heros . 
  `` how would you vote if there were a general election held tomorrow ? 
  would you vote ... conservative , labour , liberal democrat [ rotate order ] or for some other party '' 1 . that is pretty much a leading question ... it does n't give you the choice to say `` i disagree with all of them '' / `` would not vote '' / `` do n't think there is a party that i support '' / ... 2 . 
  if you calculate opposition votes + `` other party '' votes you end up with 53 % not supporting the current government .
