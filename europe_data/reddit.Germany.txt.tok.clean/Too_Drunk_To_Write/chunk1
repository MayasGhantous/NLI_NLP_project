despite a nearby local power threatening to invade it on a daily basis wat . 
   europe could have solved the refugee problem by setting up camps in affected areas yeah , lets set up a camp in a sovereign state like syria and tell assad and russia , that if we see any planes nearby we 'll just shoot em down . 
  jesus christ , how far are you guys detached from reality ? 
  holy shit mate . 
  everytime i read this stuff , its hard to imagine that these people really exist . 
  hey , thats not too bad , 
   this quite likely though . 
  the far right in germany has increased , so it 's quite likely that more people have favorable views of hitler . 
  wont happen . 
  i hate waiting in line for everything anyway . 
  still think `` a world were science and progress , can lead to all mans happiness '' should be the european motto . 
  dude , wtf :(, 
  do you want the migrants to populate all of europe !?!, 
  [ mfw someone says that swedes dont have an identity , culture or history ] ( http://www.hymntime.com/tch/img/a/d/o/adolphus_g.jpg ) all jokes aside , i cant believe a swedish politian would actually say something like this . 
  is there more context or does this person have no clue of her country or the people living there ? 
  someone should draw a bingo-board with insults against the eu . 
  we could already mark ` just like the soviet union ' , ` nazi 's ' and now ` mafia ', 
  what are you talking about ? 
  scientology isnt banned in germany . 
  its just not recognized as a religion because its obviously just a financial scam . 
  also , scientology is monitored by the german intelligence service . 
  the same intelligence service which monitores some mosques . 
  dont let these populists destroy the eu . 
   he did what kemal atat\u00fcrk had done in turkey in the 1920s lol, 
  molotov cocktails, 
   instead fucked up the entire campaign . 
  same goes for the somee offensive . 
  those british men were just ripped to shreds because of douglas haig 's incompetence, 
  what !? 
  france and russia are allies again !? 
  where the fuck did i put the schliefenplan . 
  german here . 
   why is germany banning the nazis then . 
  what do you mean by banning nazis ? 
  its illegal to deny the holocaust or wave around the nazi flag and that sort of stuff but of course you 're allowed to be a nationalist . 
  well , time to get those winged hussars rollin ' again . 
  oh that was just an example . 
  of course countries had evaluate who provides what and how much to keep it fair . 
   in any case , matching nuclear weapons is not necessary . 
  right now , yes . 
  but m.a.d. 
  would become relevant if such a big conflict would ever break out . 
   thats a speculation because events probably would n't have unfolded the way well , we still would have needed dat lebensraum . 
   to break up the union or stop its expansion towards the territory eyed by the russians . 
  to break up one of the only powers that can impose sanctions on the oligarchy ... sound about right to me . 
   spending on defense while not taking care of the social side , such as inequality and poverty , will only accelerate the demise of the eu . 
  look at how easily they broke the us ( because , let 's be honest , the us is broken ) . 
  yes . 
  of course . 
   the only shield the eu can hope to have is the social safety net ... 
  so let 's enforce that one , not the missile shield or whatever . 
  and if russians land in sweden , i think we can send them back easily with the guns we have . 
  yes and no . 
  while i agree that fighting the russian influence on the eu population is just as important , the eu at the moment would not stand a big chance against russia * on their own * . 
  we dont know how the trump administration will behave in the future . 
  and this isnt even bringing atomic weapons into the equation which russia has alot more of than the eu . 
   the current russian attacks are cyber attacks and using the current social inequality to create tensions inside the union . 
  our response should n't be a bunch of howitzers ( ... ) i agree . 
  and why would russia be interested in creating tensions in the union ? 
  dude , i 'm just trying to answer your question . 
  you dont have to be so hostile about it . 
  i dont know the details why the order was exactly placed but the argument behind eu-states getting more military equipment is that we dont have another super power which we completely trust right now . 
  reports about russian intelligence mudding the water in the west are constantly popping up . 
  even going as high as to the president of the united states . 
  in case of conflict ( and i 'm not saying this is likely to happen ) we cant rely on anybody except ourselves . 
  but yes , denmark will be using the howitzers mostly for exercises . 
  to support eu members should tensions in the east escalate, 
  i would like to see a team approach when we 're talking about the defense of the eu . 
  it would make sense to set up a military comission where the countries decide who provides what to the defense . 
  germany could provide most of the `` technology '' parts like tanks and the stuff that we 're allowed to build where france could provide more infantry . 
  this `` island '' - military solution we have at the moment where every country has a bit of everything is inefficient . 
  nobody who lives in the eu wants another conflict inside the union , no matter the cost . 
  a war between two eu states like france and italy is totally unthinkable . 
  its time that we stop hoping that the us comes and saves us when aggressions in the east rise . 
  this is fucking disgusting . 
  lol . 
  rise up natiooooons priiiiiide !, 
  what do you mean ? 
  they kicked napoleon out of germany . 
  either that or battle of leipzig . 
  both are common . 
  man , this sub really is just `` lol tommys get rekt '' sometimes . 
  sorry bout that . 
  we still love you, 
  aryan is not a real race you god damn moron !, 
  ** ding ding ding ** we 've got a stefan molyneux bingo !, 
  that post almost ticks all the boxes . 
  * dehumanizing by calling people `` parasites '' ? 
  ** check ** * marxism/communism is responsible ? 
  ** check ** * something something downfall of the west ? 
  ** check **, 
   like saving private ryan not even mentioning any other non-us troops during the entire landing despite the vast majority of those soldiers not being british . 
  you know that saving private ryan is a movie right ? 
  like a story ? 
  centered around so called `` characters '' . 
  its not a documentary . 
  how are they right ? 
  does the report say anything about postmodernism ? 
  what am i suppose do get from that . 
  does the report say cultural marxism is at fault or why are you replying to me ?
