  biggest supermarket chains in poland : * 1 . polish (  2800 stores ) * 2 . polish * 3 . portuguese * 4 . polish * 5 . polish * 6 . german ( lidl ) ( 950 stores ) * 7 . polish * 8 . danish * 9 . polish * 10 . polish and i 'm sure even the ones which are not polish have poles working there . 
  still not seeing why that is a bad thing though, 
   i said it was a mistake but why ? 
  polands economy is not `` enslaved '' to german companies . 
  just look at these examples : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_companies_of_poland  ** most of poland 's economy since communism has been developed by small and medium businesses ** , but large corporations still control aspects of heavy industry , mining , and chemical refining . 
  sounds like you just dont like capitalism in its current form and prefer a more nationalistic structure . 
   they were wrong in thinking that this is the right decision and it would work longterm , as proven by the current situation . 
  so you decided that all the economic growth that came from joining the eu including all the programs is not worth accepting a few migrants ? 
  come the fuck on man . 
   well , they were fucking wrong , how were they wrong ? 
  poland is pretty well of now and the rest of the eu also benefited from poland joining . 
   because there can never be truly good relations between european countries , especially with germany . 
  why do you think that ? 
   how is that going against my argument that you profitet a lot from our access ? 
  i dont argue against that . 
  i would never say that the rest of the eu didnt benefit from poland joining . 
  it does not have to be one or the other . 
  its both . 
  and that is a good thing . 
  i love that poland joined the eu and i dont agree with the people here that polands economic growth is just because of eu pumping money into the country . 
   pretty much . 
  i dont see it that way . 
  `` importing '' implies that they were consciously transported from their home country into germany . 
  thats not how it happend . 
  greece was getting to the breaking point because of the sheer amount if migrant influx . 
  taking some of them does not count as `` importing '' them to me . 
  how is that a bad think though ? 
  polands economy is growing through the roof even during the financial crisis . 
  why did they join in the first place then ? 
  seems like the numbers are stacked against you . 
   poland has seen the largest increase in gdp per capita ( more than 100 % ) both among the former soviet-bloc countries , and compared to the eu-15 ( around 45 % ) . 
  it has had uninterrupted economic growth since 1992 , even after the 2007 financial crisis but now that a problem comes up , you dont want to know the eu anymore because you only care about yourself . 
  this has nothing to do with being generous or empathic . 
  its about solidarity inside the union . 
  neither did i say eastern european states were heartless or bigoted . 
  germany does not want the people either , but they are already in greece and italy . 
  and not helping out the disadvantaged countries of the union while gladly reaping the benefits is messed up . 
   so stop pushing it onto us . 
  this is what i mean . 
  how can you write that shit with a straight face . 
  you 're acting like germany imported these people and now wants to dump them onto you . 
  the truth is that you only want the eu when its convinient for your country and dont give a shit about when problems come up . 
   you did n't bulk up shit german . 
  well , yes . 
  i didnt , the eu did . 
  * total polish contribution to the eu budget -- $ 3.718 billion * total eu spending in poland -- $ 13.358 billion * source : * http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/poland_en  the eu is a trading alliance and you are getting insane profits from it . 
  from the cheap factories in the east to your banks , grocery stores and so on . 
  i dont see how this discredits my claim . 
  of course germany benefits . 
   `` we will take all refugees , everybody come here . '', 
  ** merkel : ** `` we will take some steem of italy and greece because our economy can handle it . 
  can anyone help aswell ? '', 
  ... ... ... * crickets *, 
  i dont see why people are so mad about this . 
  to me it seems pretty clear who is in the wrong . 
  ** visegrad four : ** `` wow . 
  joining the eu has broad us a huge economic growth and everyone seems to benefit . 
  the eu is awesome ! '', 
  ** eu : ** `` hey there guys . 
  we 're currently working on a solution for the migrant influx but we cant leave greece alone with the ones that are already here . 
  how about we solve this as a team like we agreed to in parliament ? '', 
  ** visegrad four : ** `` eu is undemocratic !, 
  edit : a sentence, 
  inb4 unrestricted submarine warfare, 
  agreed, 
  because it was at a celebration of her party ( the cdu ) . 
  and a state should never be seen as synonymous with the party in power . 
  makes sense right ? 
  in addition to that merkel grew up in the ddr where the state was pretty much just the sed regime . 
  but ofcourse this reasonable explanation wont stop idiots to start shouting : '' look !, 
  merkel hates her own country !, 
  she wants to replace the natives with refugees !!!!!, 
  why is greece fighting with greece ? 
   it 's looks like some bad ghetto in istanbul surrounding the cathedral . 
  shitton of scummy people there too . 
  with that line of thinking we 'd still have polio around . 
  clearly he 's talking about the famous iron maiden protests . 
  plz balkans , not again . 
  just chill out for a few decades, 
   germans are n't anglo-saxons , and british people are only partially anglo-saxon . 
    from wikipedia : the anglo-saxons are a people who have inhabited great britain from the 5th century . 
  they comprise people from germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental europe , their descendants , and indigenous british groups who adopted some aspects of anglo-saxon culture and language . 
   if you 're willing to cut your safety net and spy like crazy on your citizens , you do n't belong in europe . 
  where have you been the last couple of years ? 
  even the german bundesnachrichtendienst spied on its citizens . 
  that is in no way exclusive to the uk or the us . 
  i even would argue that the eu should try to keep the good ties to the five eyes . 
   they 're not culturally european though , any more than americans or russians . 
  they do n't share our values of social democracy , privacy , freedom , and resistance to tyrants like putin and trump . 
  wtf mate ? 
  are talking about the same country ? 
  last time i checked the uk was a sovereign democracy with all kinds of social security . 
   they 're not culturally european though their anglo-saxons for christs sake , just like us germans . 
  even if all that would be true ...  they should be kept as far away from europe as possible . 
  you know their on the same continent right ? 
   yes , because when you are surrounded by british and germany you need friend somewhere . 
  that may be true a hundred years ago . 
  france and germany are the two closest states in the eu , i would say . 
  i 'm so sick of all this shit . 
  all this `` yeah fuck the uk/eu '' is really annoying .
