germany is inviting migrants , they follow the call by the millions , the other countries are forced to close the borders . 
  i think thats the rough idea here . 
  you are right , i should have written : `` attacks on refugees '' . 
  this is one of the cases i was talking about : http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/rheinland-pfalz-ein-toter-bei-streit-in-asylbewerberunterkunft-a-1067932.html, 
  source for the 95 % ? 
  actually in last years attacks on refugee homes , 2 refugees died . 
  but both times , the perpetrators were also refugees , so nobody cared . 
  what would her opponents have to do to demonstrate higher intelligence ? 
  so it can not be that bad in iraq ? 
  in my mental model its more like this : the middle class pays for the upper class ( owners of companies , capital , and houses ) and for the lower class ( who profit from social security ) . 
  no wonder the mittelschicht is getting smaller . 
  then the left says : the upper class are the bad guys , and the right says : the lower class are the bad guys . 
  both voices cancel out , and nothing happens . 
  the middle class keeps paying taxes , social security , indirect taxes for the lower class and keeps working for and paying rent to the upper class . 
  merkel brought it onto the german taxpayers, 
  yep , we should include that tax of our gas bills as well ( so total tax will be even higher ) , but thats too complicated for me . 
  subsidiaries only comprise a small amount of total government spending , most of it is social stuff . 
  look here : http://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tvoed/vka?id=tvoed-vka-2015&amp;g=e_13&amp;s=1&amp;zv=vbl&amp;z=100&amp;zulage=0&amp;stj=2016&amp;stkl=1&amp;r=0&amp;zkf=0&amp;kk=15.5%25 i 'm in e13 stage 3 , so 4077.52 $ ( argebeitgeber ) brutto and 2345.50 $ netto . 
  if a adjust for arbeitgeberanteil and vat , i can spend 45cent for each euro my employer pays for me . 
  this corresponds to 55 % `` taxes '' . 
  i admit that 70 % was an estimation from my side , based on the asssumption that i forgot some more hidden taxes , and that most people who work fulltime earn more than me and pay a higher percentage of income tax . 
  the gov. 
  is really good at hiding from you how much you actually pay to them . 
  my tax report says 2340 . also you miss the part that your employer pays directly to the government ( arbeitgeberanteil ) and vat ( mehrwertsteuer ) . 
  brutto-netto-rechner . info simply doesnt include all the taxes that you have to pay . 
  atm i can spend around 45 % of my wage ( in an entry-level job ) what do you define as astronomical taxation ? 
  i earn 4000 brutto and 2340 netto each month . 
  the `` real '' brutto ( including the part which the employer pays ) is more like 4500 . after vat ( mehrwertsteuer ) i have around 2000 netto . 
  so in my case i pay around 55 % taxes at my first job after university . 
  later when i earn more , the percentage will rise because of progressive taxing . 
  its not wealth that is spread . 
  its the result of astronomical taxes . 
  if you add up income tax , `` lohnnebenkosten '' and vat , you pay around 70 % taxes in germany . 
  from the same article : a detailed report seen by germany 's bild newspaper listed a total of 1,688 sex crimes committed by asylum seekers , refugees and illegal immigrants in 2015 -- 3.6 per cent of the nationwide total of almost 47,000 . 
  of those , 458 were rapes or sexual assaults . 
  * refugees make up roughly 2 per cent of germany 's population , the the local reported , meaning the rate of sexual offences is disproportionately high . 
  what is the push factor that pushes people out of austria into germany ? 
  since when is a claim to asylum important ? 
  nothing prevents you from buying a fake syrian passport . 
  political damage versus criminal damage . 
  i choose the first one over the other every day . 
  offer asylum , but no integration . 
  like the camps in australia . 
  if someone flees from war , he or she can have safety this way . 
  but not more . 
  yes , that will show the other countries not taking in all those young muslim males without education . 
  my ex gf had similar experiences , working with refugees . 
  she gives german lessons , and she is a really small woman , the men just ignored her . 
  in germany its this city : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ludwigshafen_am_rhein, 
  sure : https://wikiislam.net/wiki/rape_in_islam#qur.27an, 
  how is someone polish looking ? 
  they look exactly like germans . 
  idk , but using the word police at all sounds a lot like amtsanma\u00dfung to me, 
  well it is still higher than the native birth rate in germany , so the percentage of muslims is rising further . 
  german here . 
  does n't change a thing . 
  in germany its basically impossible to deport people . 
  you just have to lose your forged syrian passport , and thats it . 
  they can not prove that you are from pakistan/marokko/etc , so you stay . 
  and i think you overestimate the ratio of combatants that get shot during a war . 
  anyway , nobody from my family fought in ww2 anyway . 
  going to the nazi boy scouts is not really the thing you would get a darwin award for . 
  tbh , i do n't see the comparability . 
  if you can learn one thing from the german refugee politics , its this : you can not deport someone who `` lost '' his passport and `` forgot '' where he came from . 
  so basically nothing changed . 
  that would be some nice enrichment by french culture, 
  why ? 
   very few people will describe the victims of the jonestown massacre with words like [ ... ] i would ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_and_crime#germany says otherwise . 
  now who do we trust ? 
  what if statistics are not unambiguous ? 
  it seems like this app always takes the left side of the interpretation . 
  tumblr tells us that racism can only come from a position of power and privilege . 
  something that nazis do n't have . 
  ( that was a joke btw ), 
  probably only 15 years ( out of a maximum of 25 ) . 
  come on , its germany . 
  we do n't really punish criminals . 
  why the quotation marks ? 
  some examples : http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2015/09/29/vw-the-latest-in-long-list-of-companies-caught-cheating http://jalopnik.com/watchdog-group-says-other-car-companies-are-cheating-on-1732615322 http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/216039-more-manufacturers-found-to-violate-diesel-emissions-standards-but-blame-the-test-not-the-vehicles, 
  also , every other car manufacturer has also been proven to cheat , using the same tricks . 
  the only difference with vw is that they acknowledged it ( something you should never do , as it seems ) . 
  you mean the humans that did n't want to apply for asylum in austria ? 
  that still does n't help if you do n't know what the country of origin is , does it ? 
  but then you still can not proof that he is from pakistan . 
  also , germany gives out benefits to people like this . 
  we are far too nice . 
  last time i took a train through the suburbs of paris , i was the only non-black person in the train cabin . 
  probably most of them were born in france , but they still have immigration background . 
  true . 
  but after they have applied and got denied , they still get benefits until they are deported . 
  which may very well never happen . 
       that 's not possible . 
  you ca n't punish somebody more or less with the death penalty for minor crimes . 
  do you really assume that a civil war has a 100 % death toll ? 
  most wars are more in the 1-5 % range also , they could still go back to turkey . 
  why drive them ? 
  we could give them european train tickets and food for 5 days . 
  probably not . 
  you can not deport someone who threw away his passport .
