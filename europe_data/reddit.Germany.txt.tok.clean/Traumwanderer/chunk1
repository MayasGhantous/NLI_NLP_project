too much logic . 
  in germany it 's also on christmas eve . 
  mostly after christmas dinner too . 
  wow , that 's not even possible in my part of germany . 
  not sure about the exam part ( they change that quite often and i have been out for a while ) but history was around until grade 10 permanently and after that you had to take it a number of times till the end of school . 
  love silent films . 
  especially if they do screenings with live music . 
  for germany some big directors : [ friedrich wilhelm murnau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f._w._murnau ) some of his works are lost forever . 
  nosferatu ( 1922 ) der letzte mann ( 1924 , the last laugh in english ) very influential in terms of new ideas of handling the camera faust ( 1926 ) [ paul wegener ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_wegener ) der student von prag ( 1913 , the student of prague ) der golem ( 1915 ) there are only fragments left , but you can find those on youtube [ robert wiene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_wiene ) das cabinet des dr. caligari ( 1920 ) - one of the high points of german expressionism cinema [ fritz lang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritz_lang ) obviously . 
  is described as austria-german . 
  dr. mabuse ( 1922 ) die niebelungen ( 1924 ) metropolis ( 1927 ) frau im mond ( 1929 , woman in the moon ) - silent film sci-fi m ( 1931 ) - one of the first german sound films and an absolute influence on everything . 
  [ georg wilhelm pabst ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g._w._pabst ) actually not german , but austrian , but working in germany and has to be mentioned . 
  also directed the film version of die dreigroschenoper by brecht , obviously with sound . 
  die freudlose gasse ( 1925 , joyless stree ) - one of the first films doing away with expressionism . 
  or any game on the way to the finals . 
  not as empty but notably fewer people . 
  what ? 
  and who buys things in over 1500 hardware stores across germany ? 
  ( and those are the shops for laypersons , not professionals ) . 
  good comparison . 
  especially the `` brings his kids into his films '' aspect is also there . 
  now i know where my dutch language teacher did his shopping . 
  oh , i miss those too . 
  strong memories of getting them as pocket money . 
  ( and the following trip to the [ bude ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/trinkhalle_ ( verkaufsstelle \\ ) ) to buy some kids magazine and sweets . ), 
  much better to handle . 
  rpgs : witcher 1-3 , mass effect , dragon age , kotor , kingdom of amalur . 
  nothing surprising , the usual suspects . 
  adventure games : the longest journey ( and its two successors ) . 
  i like most of the daedalic ones , the blackwell series , life is strange . 
  much more games coming from europe in this genre than in many other too . 
  also assassin 's creed . 
  syndicate was really a step in the right direction and sometimes i just have the urge to climb tall buildings . 
  what i really ca n't stand are first person games no matter which genre . 
  breaks my immersion much more than seeing the back of my character . 
  nope . 
  but apart from christmas ( and a few other holidays ) churches around here are seldom full enough that people have to sit in the back if they do n't actively choose to . 
  also , most people would probably not like it . 
  the same for me but switch french with italian . 
  and sometimes when i get a book in its german translation as a present i like to read through that and get the original afterwards . 
  translation of literature is very interesting . 
  the name of the wind , for example , has an excellent translation so i read it ( and the second book ) in both versions . 
  rothfuss wrote some interesting blog post about his work with the translators and at least the german translation really shows that he communicates with them . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2008/01/on-perils-of-translation/ ) & [ 2 ] ( https://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2008/02/perils-of-translation-part-2/ ) & [ 3 ] ( https://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2011/08/fanmail-qa-why-does-it-take-so-long-to-translate-the-book/ ), 
  fight me , i already visited four castles from your list . 
  concerning germany my first thought is always the northsea coastline , but another user already mentioned the underappreciated north . 
  visitors flock to berlin and bavaria mostly . 
  if one wants castles : [ thuringia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_castles_in_thuringia ) is not often mentioned , but there are a lot ( this was a border region for a long time , so castles for defence ) , from ruins to those that were `` updated '' over the centuries . 
  a few [ pictures ] ( http://www.thaff-thueringen.de/en/welcome-to-thuringia/living-in-thuringia/castles-and-palaces/ ), 
  they are like any other people and come on a scale from flamboyant to stereotypical male ( to simplify it ) . 
  so it depends on the person . 
  like with all those straight germans . 
  things with motors so for example hair dryers . 
  the answers on / r/germany to [ the same question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/6ozkm2/visiting_american_having_power_issues/?st=j5hcc4dt&amp;sh=ba162dd1 ) taught me that today . 
  but that is mostly relevant for things you would think about to take to europe if you move . 
  also , the employer has to show that they could n't find anybody from all over the eu for a specific position if they want to hire someone from outside if i 'm not mistaken . 
   for the `` allgemeine hochschulreife '' ( the highest degree you can get from secondary school ) you have to have taken at least two different foreign languages . 
  yeah , but many people still take latin as the second language and only learn to translate it . 
  so no modern second language for them on that way . 
  knew he speaks german , but never heard him ( or anyone from that part of your country ) speak . 
  interesting [ accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wkax72ojwk ) . 
  what do the french critics say if you do n't mind to paraphrase a bit ? 
  i find it quite remarkable that the biggest war movie of the last years is again about wwii . 
  would have expected a big one about wwi during those centenary years . 
  but perhaps there is something coming up next year . 
  if you visit a cinema in germany you will ( almost always ) get sugared popcorn . 
  it is the default here so i find popcorn with salt strange . 
  also , the sugar caramelises a bit , so it might be quite similar to the kettle corn . 
  not crips but a savoury snack : germans really like [ erdnussflips ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/erdnussflips ) despite peanuts not being a staple in german cuisine at all . 
   i will also say , as a bit of a shout out to the germans here , and to make sure i 'm not coming across as biased - if england is n't your thing - it 's always been a dream of mine to head to germany during oktoberfest , i 've heard it 's a bloody good time . 
  most of oktoberfest actually takes place in september . 
  this year 's date is 16.09.-03 .10 . for example . 
  my surname is not very common and there is only me with the combination of my given name and surname . 
  so i get every name.surename@emailprovider address i want but on the other hand i ca n't hide behind other people in a google search . 
  my mother 's maiden name is a little bit more common and more evenly distributed over germany . 
  if you look up my surname at [ this german site ] ( http://www.verwandt.de ) you can clearly see which part of germany i 'm from . 
  and with knowledge of the name , one can probably assume that my ancestors are from the netherlands though it 's a germanised version of a place there . 
   i think there is still a stigma with older people but it 's different for the younger generation really depends on the people . 
  my boyfriend transitioned ( from f to m ) while in a relationship with me and both sets of grandparents still allive ( one from me , city ; the other his , from a village ) had no problems with it . 
  they only needed a bit of time to adjust and are perfectly fine with the situation now . 
  the same with a few older people from various clubs . 
  on the other hand we had one good friend never making any contact again after telling him and not responding to anything , one making really unappreciated comments [ ' i only believe that after bottom surgery and having a look at it ' ] and two others becoming really distance afterwards . 
  but all in all being trans is even more of a none topic than gay marriage was if you do n't know a person in the situation . 
  and there are quite a few laws and recommendations towards doctors that need to be reworked to get them up to a modern standard . 
  but they watch films/tv series dubbed to german !, 
  crucify them !, 
  great points . 
  * dialects : while the north speaks a continuum of low german dialects the south speaks high german ones ( which is not the same as hochdeutsch/standard german , even though it 's the same word in german for both ) . 
  there is something called central german between both but often there is only a distinction between southern and northern dialects . 
  on a map , it looks like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isogloss#/media/file:german_dialectal_map.png ) . 
  painting wise i would argue that [ der wanderer \u00fcber dem nebelmeer ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/der_wanderer_%c3%bcber_dem_nebelmeer#/media/file:caspar_david_friedrich_-_der_wanderer_%c3%bcber_dem_nebelmeer.jpg ) is not only one of the most well-known paintings but also a great example of romantic art . 
  in that time period ( and those before , but it gets more important here ) the different arts were a link between all those small and bigger german states and one way to support a national identity . 
  you certainly could come up with a long interpretation how the painting connects to germany on a contentual level but the circumstances of the time seem to be more important . 
  concerning classical music i 'm a bit overwhelmed with all the possibilities . 
  and if you go for a german play it always comes down to faust . 
  and they were nice enough to spread it to most of europe , sending emissaries to open shops . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  and do n't forget that hyphen double names which sometimes cross the boundary between chantalle and friedrichs because the second one is a name from a grandparent . 
  would you share where you live ? 
  i met a very small wilhelm the other day , but no friedrich in that age range .
