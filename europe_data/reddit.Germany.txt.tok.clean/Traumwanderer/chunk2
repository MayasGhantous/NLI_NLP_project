  guess this names also make a slow comeback . 
  it happens here too but is constrained to the more educated part of the population in contrast to the still very often anglosphere names people of the working class use . 
  they are not in the top 20 but closing in according to [ this site ] ( http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/jahrgang/j2016 ) ( germany has no official statistic on that so they count names from different ways you can announce your baby to the world like newspapers or in the internet age hospital websites ) karl seems to make a comeback , as well as theo . 
  on the girls side , greta , frieda and matilda stick out for me the most . 
  it also depends a bit on the place you live , there are first names that you encounter more in the southern parts and some you only see in the north of the country . 
  it 's not about guilt . 
  my grandmother had her 84 birthday this year and she was born in 1933 . 
  the generation of people that could be guilty in any regard is already very small and in a few years , only very few very long-lived individuals will be around . 
  it 's about being aware of your countries history and not forgetting the past as it turns to `` real '' history with no zeitzeugen ( is there an english expression ? 
  people who lived through the times and can talk about them ) still around . 
  it 's the [ lieberoser w\u00fcste ( wiki only in german ) ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lieberoser_w%c3%bcste ) in brandenburg . 
  about 95km south-east of berlin . 
  it 's the result of a fire in the 1940s and was used as a military training area for a long time . 
  it 's also a matter of pronouns to distinguish both . 
  `` die see '' always means sea while `` der see '' is lake . 
  i guess it 's similar to the way j.k.rowling started with using only the first letters of her first name : the publisher wanted her to sound male because it was the story about a boy and obviously only male writers can write about a protagonist of their own gender . 
  seeing that the books are a bit older there certainly is som reasoning like that behind the choice to use a female pseudonym and not a male one ( and a pseudonym they certainly would have used either way because it looks better if a book series appears to be from the same author . 
  less confusing for the people buying ) . 
  quite interesting , i know more examples of female author -  male pseudonym than the other way around . 
  googled those because i never heard of them . 
  did you know lisbeth werner was the pseudonym of [ two male danish writers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbeth_werner ) ? 
  borrowed the audio version on cassette from our library over a dozen times . 
  loved those stories , they had a very cosy feeling about them . 
  read a lot of astrid lindgren as a child . 
  still one of the most beloved children authors in germany . 
  for germany look at this [ page ] ( http://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/for-qualified-professionals/working/demanded-professions/doctors ) . 
  especially the last part about how recognition of your degree will work . 
  and language . 
  doctors should be able to talk to their patients fluently . 
  that 's true . 
  i should have written , `` not many international tourists who do n't have a part of wadden sea at their own coast '' . 
  lots of german tourists in denmark too . 
  it 's also a unesco world natural heritage site ( in its entirety , so the whole coast from the netherlands to denmark . ) . 
  you definitely do n't meet many international tourists there . 
  quite a shame , there are so many nice looking small villages along the coast . 
  interesting , thanks . 
  in german `` mittag '' describes both the meal you eat at that time of day and the time of day itself . 
  and normally that was the hot meal of the day which has changed a bit but no one bothers with the name . 
  it 's still the same . 
  it 's the same in germany : morgen vormittag mittag nachmittag abend nacht do you really say `` lunch '' or did you miss the `` middag '' before that ? 
  ireland . 
  had a very good cultural history course on the country while studying and somehow it stuck with me . 
  on an european scale its a rather small country on the periphery of the continent ( naturally being an island is also a factor ) so we hardly learned anything about it in history class back in school . 
  a bit about the troubles but in a very shallow `` catholics '' vs. `` protestants '' way . 
  it 's quite intersting how big of an influence irish monks had on converting europe to christianity in the first place . 
  i 'm a fan of alexander von humboldt . 
  also his brother but alexander is more something akin to a `` universalgelehrter '' in a time where the different fields of knowledges ( especially in the natural sciences ) really began to divide and specify . 
  in germany we have the [ volkstrauertag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volkstrauertag ) . 
  it was first established after wwi and today is day to equally remeber soldiers and civlians dying in wars or other conflicts . 
  it works like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/healthcare_in_germany#health_insurance ) if op is interested in further details . 
  it 's not an embassy but the us consulat-general in leipzig looks more like you describe foreign nation embassies so like [ this ] ( http://bilder.t-online.de/b/59/53/09/38/id_59530938/tid_da/us-generalkonsulat-in-leipzig.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://www.mz-web.de/image/1340606/2x1/940/470/df096aaadc3c886e4411bf6a688fc7d3/cy/71-85211284--auch-das-us-ge--07-06-2015-19-41-05-692-.jpg ) . 
  i had to pass it on my way to university for a time and it 's quite strange the first few times because it 's always guarded by police and there is quite a bit of blocked space around it before there is even the fence . 
  it 's a bit hard to explain and it 's only my impression and the following is a bit of generalisation . 
  in media german dialects are often used to indicate that the character is from the countryside or if from a city not very well educated . 
  that 's a consequence of standard german being the normal and desired thing in schools for many decades and dialects and local accent disappered more and more . 
  ( though there is sort of a renaissance . ), 
  for example english media often use a scotish accent to indicate vikings or viking like cultures . 
  we have no equivalent of that in german because there is no dialect that is a one-to-one translation of what a scotish accent invokes in somebody who is familiar with how it used in media . 
  different connotations at work . 
  so all the skellige islanders in witcher 3 speaks as much standard german as the protagonist while there english speaking counterparts have this scotish influence and automaticaly a different flair to their part of the world not only through different buildings but also through language . 
  how to train your dragon has tried to use a north german accent for the ( adult ) villagers . 
  it 's a nice try and fit but i must confess it 's a bit strange because they seldom do something like that . 
  my fair lady is a glorious exeption because you need an accent for the story to work . 
  so eliza doolittle has a heavy berlin dialect while walking through london . 
  german dubs mostly seem to use different [ language register ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/register_ ( sociolinguistics \\ ) ) to indicate different types of characters . 
  i actually did a road trip through cornwall once before knowing about that ( rosamunde pilcher could be a german name and i always assumed she was ) and even though it 's a cliche to always stumble over many of your own compatriots on vacation i was astonished by all this german pensioners and learned about the strange influence of our public broadcast on tourism . 
  yeah , as a british actor you seem to have an advance to be cast in any kind of historical film . 
  interesting how the accent is seen as more proper for that . 
  and even without using it with cumberbatch playing [ thomas edison ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2140507/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4 ) . 
  hardly any american actors in it and they seem to shoot much or all of it in the uk . 
  thanks for sharing your thoughts . 
  the speak the most standard german you can imagine . 
  but foreign films are mostly dubbed in the same way . 
  german movie and tv productions and dubs use accents and dialects rather sparse compared to the english speaking world . 
  different connotations . 
  so ... there are [ 131 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907694/episodes?season=1 ) of those films ( though it 's not all cornwall , scottland is also a setting ) . 
  yes , you read that number right . 
  i never sat through any of these but as far as i can see everbody with a speaking role is german . 
  they hire local extras for things like `` cocktail waitress '' or if they need a baby . 
  it 's kind of funny to have this very german tv films with characters named lord james blixton . 
  reminds me of [ these skit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zygk3yvuee4 ) about the tv announcer who gives a summary of the first parts of a british tv drama with all the `` th '' in the names of the dozen of characters and place names . 
  unfortunately no subtitles . 
  never heard about doc martin though there seems to be a german dub . 
  but it only aired on pay tv so i do n't think many people have seen it . 
  we seem to have had a german adaption called doktor martin which ran for two series . 
  basically the same premise with a berlin doctor changing his residence to the east frisian coast . 
  perhaps not as funny . 
  so many of them are set in cornwall ( where rosamunde pilcher was born ) that a good chunk of the cornish tourist revenue must come from this rosamunde pilcher bus tours german travel agencies organise . 
  in the former gdr part of the country most fruit and vegetable shops are run by vietnamese immigrants . 
  you also have less kebab and more asia fast food places . 
  wow . 
  poor guy . 
  people are idiots . 
  visit an open air museum if you want something without actual humans living in . 
  and if you want to visit a fake castle try schloss linderhof . 
  a bit smaller and another style but at least it 's was finished during ludwigs lifetime . 
  and it 's less crowded . 
  germany lost its colonys very early due to the loss in wwi and in contrast to other european countrys . 
  so we never had a colony gain independence from us directly , we just lost them to other european nations . 
  all in all the german history with colonisation is rather short and lasted for 34 years ( 1884-1918 ) .
