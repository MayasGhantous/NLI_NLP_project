  not to say it did n't leave any cultural ties but i guess they are much smaller than for other coutnrys . 
  in history classes it 's mostly overshadowed by other things we did . 
  most germans would n't be able to tell you the present day countrys of the areas that made up the colonies . 
  namibia is perhaps the most known due to the atrocities done to the herero and nama which are a topic in media from time to time . 
  but cameroon , togo ( german west africa ) and burundi , rwand and tanzania ( german east africa ) are seldom spoken of . 
  kiautschou ( not a colony but leased from china ) is sometimes brought up because they still brew [ beer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsingtao_brewery ) . 
  [ this page ] ( http://www.fwv-sierksdorf.de/about/historie_sierksdorf/historie_sierksdorf.html ) gives the most detailed history of the muncipality of sierksdorf i could find online . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.fwv-sierksdorf.de/products/bildergalerie/alte_sierksdorfer_ansichten.html ) they have old photos . 
  the inhabitants already rented out room for early tourists at the end of the 19th century . 
  i guess it will be hard to find more details online . 
  i do n't know but observing the general area the park was build on in the 1970s i would guess it was farmland or simply that kind of grassland you have all along the german baltic coast . 
  administratively it belongs to a small municipality . 
  what are you looking for exactly ? 
  they do n't sell schnitzel at all . 
  i wanted to proof that not only germans do strange things to those . 
  disappointed . 
  but you can get a very [ polish sandwich ] ( http://www.wienerschnitzel.com/food/sandwiches/polish-sausage-sandwich/ ) . 
  that rye bread looks like some rye may have passed it once . 
  i guess they are referring to [ this ] ( http://x-culture.org/peach-vs-coconut-cultures/ ) concept . 
  this . 
  i also really the like the longest journey and it 's two succesors . 
  all three games are from norway . 
  adventures is generally a genre with a lot of interesting european developers and games . 
  the scottish enlightenment had significant influence on the german aufkl\u00e4rung . 
  works by the likes of david hume , adam ferguson and adam smith were very fast translated into german . 
  very fascinating topic which is hard to condense into a few sentence but there is good literature about it out there . 
   the reason the eu seems a little cautious when it comes to going to war / dying for your county is because we had our fill of that kinda stuff . 
  and in contrast to the us we had all the destruction that comes with it in our homes and backyards . 
  but most likely only the catholic ones ? 
  all the protestant folks went here : [ non-catholic cemetery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestant_cemetery,_rome ) , like the son of goethe , john keats and many others . 
  i loved those too . 
  and if i remember it right it had a great although slightly bittersweet ending . 
  i hope you got that sorted out . 
  my boyfriend was lucky to encounter only minor problems with doctors and therapists ( people not knowing that some things are suggestions not laws , but willing to learn . 
  ) , but we heard quite a few horror stories from other people . 
  but the krankenkasse is very stubborn in not wanting to pay things they have to pay . 
  i guess the lawyer has to earn money somehow ... 
  trans ( gender/sexual ) people still have to jump through a lot of overly bureaucratic hoops , but i guess that is to be expectected in our bureaucratic system . 
  i hope there is some movement in the next years to simplify some of the processes . 
  would be cheaper for the state too . 
  [ friendship !, 
  ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/italia_e_germania ) the cultural ties between italia and germany during the last centuries are quite fascinating . 
  who says i need a car at my destination ? 
  if i do n't go for the countryside i may need a car for one day because i want to see that special sight that is hard to reach by tram/bus . 
  everything else is covered . 
  if i visit family they have two cars around . 
  and inter-european flights can be pretty cheap , especially if you do n't want to fly tomorrow . 
  for a road-trip like vacation through sweden i would have to save a lot more : ferry ride , petrol and it is a bit more costly than germany regarding food ( not to mention the alcohol ) . 
  now , look at petrol prices in most european countries . 
  * anything by [ erich k\u00e4stner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erich_k%c3%a4stner ) ( emil und die detektive , das doppelte lottchen , p\u00fcnktchen und anton ) he also wrote some novels aimed at adults . 
  great poems . 
  * [ ottfried preu\u00dfler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otfried_preu%c3%9fler ) ( krabat , das kleine gespenst , der r\u00e4uber hotzenplotz ) especially krabat is also engaging for adults . 
  * [ michael ende ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_ende ) ( die unendliche geschichte , momo , jim knopf , der satanarch\u00e4ol\u00fcgenialkoh\u00f6llische wunschpunsch ) die unedliche geschichte ( neverending story ) is so much better than the film . 
  they left out half of the story and did n't bother to put it in the lackluster sequels . 
  * [ janosch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janosch ) ( oh , wie sch\u00f6n ist panama and so many more ) illustrated books . 
  * [ cornelia funke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornelia_funke ) ( tintenherz-trilogie , reckless ) mostly fantasy , although i liked her wilde h\u00fchner books about a bunch of girls and their everyday problems too . 
  * astrid lindgren is big in germany too that should be most of the `` big names '' . 
  could also come up with a list of depressing children books concerning ww2 and why the boy down the street and his family suddenly vanished . 
  some would say not much left of both . 
  we had flagpoles , but the only time you saw flags on them was when they were raised half-mast due to some tragic event and all public buildings did the same . 
  i think it was a german and an eu one . 
  i would make the counseling part optional instead of getting rid of it completely . 
  some people will benefit from the offer alone and i think it 's easier to have a distinct place outside the doctor 's office where you can get all information you might want without having to search for a counselor if you suddenly feel like you need one . 
  but yes , nobody who has made up their mind and informed themselves already should be compelled to the counseling . 
  i read the winnetou books and some of his other works as a child . 
  inherited them from my uncle . 
  the old movies with lex barker are shown rather regularly on tv . 
  [ der schuh des manitu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/der_schuh_des_manitu ) a parody movie on western and especially karl may movies is still the most successful german film ever . 
  i think they did new tv movies that were shown last christmas , but i did n't see them . 
  there are two big yearly karl may festivals , in [ bad segeberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_may_festival_in_bad_segeberg ) and espen , that show great open-air theater productions of one of his works . 
  it 's still quite popular and has an interesting impact on german culture . 
  we did a project in elementary school on native americans and their history for example . 
  [ here is ] ( https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/indigenous-peoples/germanys-obsession-with-american-indians-is-touchingand-occasionally-surreal/ ) an interesting article about this strange endearment from a native american living in germany . 
  that 's cool , even though it 's a slightly [ different song ] ( http://www.volksliederarchiv.de/wenn-schwarze-kittel-scharenweis/ ) . 
  but in fact , in the early 20th century many unemployed miners from the ruhr area emigrated to limburg . 
  my grandmother was born there in 1933 , though they had to return to germany when the war broke out . 
  definitely still the unofficial anthem of the ruhr area : [ steigerlied ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp6ylq2kii0 ) it 's shared with nearly any german region where mining was the prevalent form of income for centuries . 
  northrhine-westfalia got presented with an [ unofficial anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacrphvnh7s ) by the wdr ( our state 's local public-broadcasting institution ) in 2006 for its 60 birthday . 
  very cringy , trying to put all these local identities together . 
  i think it 's just a dumb internet trend . 
  someone started it , maybe posted the result , many people think it 's a `` unique '' idea for a gift . 
  shortly thereafter a whole wave of requests follow and it gets annoying . 
  the germany sub does n't react too kindly to this [ kind of thing . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/5o9lxd/hey_guys_im_trying_to_collect_photos_of_people/?st=iyqk7v90&amp;sh=6097a7c7 ) it does n't seem very personal like the people requesting these pictures claim it to be when it 's a random stranger holding some sign . 
  also , a very different mindset about privacy around here . 
  [ this here ] ( http://kamis-imagesofjesus.weebly.com/ ) seems to be a nice site showing jesus depiction in different time periods . 
  the beard appears in byzantine times , the romans of the late republic and early principate were not very keen on beards , so no beard for jesus either in their early pictures . 
  the swiss are these really nice guys who set up an entire [ website ] ( https://www.ch.ch/en/entry-stay-switzerland/ ) about immigrating to their country . 
  i do n't think they have a pure language learning visa , the working visa for third-country nationals is explained [ here ] ( https://www.ch.ch/en/working-foreign-national-requirements/ ) . 
  generally , you have to have a job lined up before applying for most work visa . 
  and the swiss have the same regulations about locals  european union/eea citizens  international workers . 
  [ ride of the valkyries ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p73z6291pt8 ) is on a similar level . 
  edit : also very famous due to their use in weddings : [ hochzeitsmarsch/wedding march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oo4z37ouei ) by felix mendelssohn bartholdy ( originally part of the stage music he composed for ein sommernachtstraum/a midsummer night 's dream ) and [ treulich gef\u00fchrt / bridal chorus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cu35lfvauw ) from richard wagner 's lohengrin . 
  i wonder what the cliches would look like today if the american occupation zone had been switched with the british one . 
  aalsuppe instead of haxe ? 
  needs more [ schapendoes ] ( http://partner-hund.de/sites/partner-hund.de/files/ehft_00409.jpg ), 
  but we have connotations for them . 
  in germany the most common is that people speaking with heavy accents/speaking dialect are more uneducated . 
  i read somewhere it 's a bit different in austria , but i 'm not sure about that . 
  and they are most often used in comedic formats to portray more conservative , soft headed people , often rural or of a lower socioeconomic class if connected to cities .
