  there is no braveheart-like , freedom fighting thing like with a general scottish accent in english for any dialect/accent in germany and it would be really hard to turn that around . 
  but a bavarian ( or anything else ) accent would not work the same way . 
  totally different connotations to accents in both languages . 
  only on tuesdays . 
  it 's the same with king arthur and some other famous rulers . 
  very popular literary/mythological trope : [ king in/under the mountain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_in_the_mountain ) . 
  kind of strange that france has none of those , except charlemagne , but you have to share him . 
  yep , my catholic great-grandfather was a joseph maria . 
  joseph is a rather catholic name , while maria ( especially in the form of marie ) can be found on both `` sides '' . 
  and unlike joseph ( very catholic and for some even typically bavarian , but they are mostly catholic ) marie is a rather normal name to give your daughter . 
  it was place seven of the most received girls names 2016 . 
  and while some old `` grandparents '' names have a kind of renaissance in the last years , joseph is not one of them . 
  no , it 's quite common as an abz\u00e4hlreim ( counting-out rhyme ? 
  those for deciding who has to start seeking with hide-and-seek ) even mentioned on [ wiki ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/abz%c3%a4hlreim#.c3.9cberregional ) . 
  most of those are very nonsensical . 
  we have those in germany too , at least with family . 
  ( or it 's just my family because my grandma grew up in the netherlands and got infected by it . ), 
  germany has basically the same situation . 
  that 's why it 's very hard to get into a german university with an us highschool diploma . 
  most have to take a year of preporational courses to take the equivalent to the german diploma . 
   there are two types of universites . 
  technically there are three . 
  kunsthochschulen ( art schools , mostly specialised in one form of art at a time , music or acting , applied or visual arts etc. ), 
  are also universities in all but name , even though there are some small differences . 
  their programmes are often regarded as artistic-scientific and they have full promotionsrecht ( right to let people do their doctorate ) . 
  next to grades from your abitur you have to get through some entrance examinations and you can get in without an abitur if you show special talent . 
  why ? 
  i find it very interesting how such sociopolitical decisions ( inviting the persecuted huguenots to settle in different german principalities and especially the kingdom of prussia ) led to cultural mingling . 
  very european in a way . 
  in fact the brothers grimm collected many of their tales from a few specific sources , two of which were hugenot families who knew their perrault very well . 
  that 's why there is some overlap with the stories . 
  presents get delivered by the christkind . 
  much more reliabel and no old men creeping in ones house and eating the pl\u00e4tzchen neccesarry . 
  no santa bringing presents , so no need for that . 
  universities mostly have publications , at my uni it was a monthly thing . 
  aspiring journalists often do the short mandatory internships during their highschool life at the local newspaper . 
  i knew a few who worked their afterwards ( some local reporting and stuff ) to learn a few practical things . 
  we do n't get bonus points for extracurricular activities for uni applications , i think that is another factor to consider . 
  nobody cares for that , your final grade has to be right to study certain subjects . 
  2007 and we did this until oberstufe . 
  afterwards it was a mumbled collective greeting without standing up . 
  and i did attend a really ordinary gymnasium . 
  more of a courtesy and a ritualised beginning of class . 
  no loud speaking to the pupils next to you after that . 
  just search for that jack wolfskin logo . 
  parts of westfalen have the cleaning and box thing too even though the details differ a bit . 
  no surprise the brits put us into one state ... 
  i like this one from the north frisian islands ( mostly f\u00f6hr ) : [ wiki ( german only ) ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/trachten_der_inseln_f%c3%b6hr_und_amrum_und_der_halligen ) , [ 1 ] ( http://www.reisenews-online.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/foehrer-trachten.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.br.de/fernsehen/ard-alpha/sendungen/schulfernsehen/tracht-schleswig-holstein-foehrer100~_v-img__16__9__xl_-d31c35f8186ebeb80b0cd843a7c267a0e0c81647.jpg?version=f64c3 ) not much traditional tracht left in most places . 
  the same for germany . 
  perhaps not totally obscure , but the [ northern parts of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_germany ) ( especially the coastal regions ) get much less attention than everything ~ ~ bavarian ~ ~ chlich\u00e9 germany . 
  edit : [ a random website ] ( http://www.touropia.com/destinations-in-northern-germany/ ) with some examples . 
  it 's rather hard to find a solo version . 
  there is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udovf8lqlyg ) but the singer is not a native speaker . 
  if you can read ipa [ this guide ( pdf file ) ] ( https://www.choraline.com/files/beethoven_pron_guidebook.pdf ) could help . 
  and - last but not least - let 's not forget about [ this version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owgzdynpaso ) . 
  even as a new arisen dictatorship we have only your best interests on our mind . 
  tourism is steady income . 
  your fellow countrymen are allowed to choose some artwork for their side of this new structure . 
  please be aware that god empress merkel will have to approve the motives . 
  we should probably build a wall, 
  best is the [ name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_sinterniklaas ) of the english voice actor . 
  [ bernd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernd_das_brot ) is already perfect . 
  let me take a look into my chrystal ball . 
  ... takes a while , have to adjust it to fifteen years ago ... but ... oh , yes ... 
  i 'm getting a picture ... slow now ... ah , i see ... 
  he had a younger sister , a really wonderfull woman he loved deeply . 
  this sister was married happily to this other guy . 
  until he left her one day , totally out of the blue for another woman . 
  our security officer saw them one day . 
  and behold , she looked just like you . 
  so he could n't control his face when he was confronted with you that day . 
  i hope you understand , his sister suffered a lot because of this break up . 
  [ th\u00fcringen / thuringia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2k0fglr4oi ) [ and ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_b-1ufsnze ) the not so touristy one . 
  that 's neat . 
  morocco must be full of aunts . 
  @op [ fr\u00e8re jaques ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr%c3%a8re_jacques ) has many different language versions . 
  i especially like the diverse onomatopoeic ways the bell sounds . 
  i find it fascinating that you have the same aunt in the netherlands . 
  the lyrics are almost the same here in germany , while the original english one is a bit more distinct and does n't mention a female relative . 
  we have a few more verses though and no train at the end . 
  i wonder which way this traveled . 
  religion is not discussed very much on a `` what 's - your-personal-belief '' level . 
  some young people i know do describe themselves as christian , but i doubt they go to church very often if at all . 
  it 's mostly a private matter , very different to the us . 
  my nephews got baptised but i can not tell you if their parents decided out of personal belief or a sense of cultural belonging . 
  i did all the rites of passage belonging to catholicism myself , but i did n't have to discuss my growing disbelief with my family or coming out to them as an atheist . 
  i just stopped believing and nobody asked . 
  there is also joachim heinrich campe . 
  [ examples here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joachim_heinrich_campe#language_purism ) . 
  his motivation was educational , sharped by ideas of the enlightenment : take away loanwords so that everybody could be able to debate on the same level . 
  in germany this can also be seen as a backlash against a particular [ trend ] ( http://chantalismus.tumblr.com ) to give your kid the most unique , often anglisised name . 
   need the other capitalletters for nouns . 
  would be even better . 
  all this needless space between words . 
  only the first letter . 
  need the other capital letters for nouns . 
  i 've currently started my way through all three witcher games . 
  this time around with polish voice acting . 
  exited for cyberpunk 2077 and the new mass effect . 
  the second one , right ?
