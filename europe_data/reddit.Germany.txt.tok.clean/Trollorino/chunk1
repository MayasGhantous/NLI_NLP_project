germany population 81.000.000 functionary 1.900.000 greece population 11.000.000 functionary 800.000 greece : privatisation ? 
  i never heard of that civil service post, 
  yeah the only thing greek needs now is a finance minister, 
  yes or no doesnt matter because the offer did not exist for a whole while . 
  i have no idea what the greek government was doing . 
  they were already debating about a new offer before they had the great idea about a referendum . 
  at least they did no freedom in ukraine . 
  usa just go away with your freedom, 
  rich germany ? 
  no no no . 
  at this time germany was fucked up . 
  extreme left and right partys were the result . 
  the ppl in east-prussia needed stuff like coal for heating . 
  and good propaganda is always based on a true story . 
  the death camps are like the pyramids . 
  tourism ( hotel flight food ) and workplace ( janitor guide ) in poland . 
  the pyramids were not built in the arab republic of egypt . 
  but today they are there so we call them the egyptian pyramids . 
  the big conflict between germany and poland started as germany was not able to pay the taxes for the supply of east-prussia ( railroad link ) any longer in zloty . 
  a really stupid person would say that this was the reason of ww2 . 
  at this time the polish government started to tolerate the discrimination against the german minority . 
  the comparison with shit and death camp victims . 
  lol cmon dude, 
  `` from darkness , through blood , to light '' i hear that for the first time . 
  sounds awesome . 
  thanks dude, 
  source ? 
  i can not upload the human remains of my great-grandmother . 
  and i dont wan na blame the poles of today . 
  the times have changed . 
  today you dont get forced to speak polish with violence . 
  just accept the polish discrimination against the german minority for ww1 and repression among the prussian . 
  it was somewhat payback time ... 
  i know that from my great-grandmother . 
  she lived there . 
  after ww1 they became german poles and got a new family name . 
  then in the 1930s they had to flee because of polish anti-german atmosphere . 
  direct after ww1 there was no escape or displacement of the germans in the new part of poland . 
  all germans just became poles . 
  but on the verge of ww2 there was no german-polish community any longer . 
  relocating was not like today cause the most of them were just farmers . 
  history is written by the winner . 
  thats the reason why every documentary about ww2 starts like : the second world war started with the german invasion of poland . 
  like nothing happened before ... 
  maybe because of the displacement . 
  in the 1930s the german poles were displaced by the polish regime . 
  80.000 german poles reached the german reich . 
  the rest were murdered . 
  the sad result of the treaty of versailles . 
  nope the death camps were ruled by ss . 
  the most of them had the black uniform without insignia . 
  they were from east-europe called `` ss-hilfstruppen '' . 
  like the `` ss-einsatzgruppen '' who did the mass shootings . 
  only 3.000 german nazis but they were supported by 30.000 volunteer from east-europe . 
  dude i dont wan na deny what the nazis did . 
  every 12 years old kid knows that . 
  but anything on polish territory is polish . 
  polish factory . 
  german car design, 
  a death camp in poland is a polish death camp . 
  do you call wroc\u0142aw a german or a polish town ? 
  argumentation completed, 
  the 3 men do not represent any instructions from putin, 
  im always trolling a little bit . 
  but what about the double moral standards ? 
  `` grube '' means hole , mine in german . 
  maybe gruber = miner . 
  would make sense in austria, 
  where is luxemburg and liechtenstein ? 
  i signed a while ago . 
  not because american products are shit but because of the `` schiedsgericht '' arbitral tribunal . 
  here they just open the window and throw the trash out, 
  you are overestimating germany . 
  i think the ppl from usa spain japan do not live on trees anymore . 
  at least the most of them, 
  cmon quality vs quantity . 
  like the unemployment rate :p, 
  they are not doing an apprenticeship . 
  its more like teaching 50 years old ppl how to create a microsoft word or exel document while they are playing some browser games . 
  they are not unemployed but earn less money as an unemployed person . 
  and then these 1.37 million ppl get the deviation from the government . 
  now they have the same amount of money like a unemployed person . 
  the problem is that you have to do the job or the government will cut the 399 euro/month . 
  at least u can be happy if you are an asylum seeker in germany . 
  u will get the same money but the government will not force you to do a job like this . 
  ** i think that this policy will make problems in the near future **, 
  aufstocker atm 1.37 million . 
  they are earning less than hartz4 = 399 euro/month + rent . 
  they are not unemployed but they get paid by our government . 
  but how can u support our government ? 
  as i wrote ** anyone without a job who is ill is not in the statistic ** that are not mentally ill ppl . 
  if u dont have a job and u have a cold or cough . 
  u are forced by the jobcenter to go to a doctor and get a sick certificate . 
  now you have to give it too the jobcenter . 
  ** at this moment you are not longer unemployed because you are working on getting healthy again . 
  ** the german government - the best to the top, 
  my point is a government that is releasing a fake statistic . 
  and a modern dictatorship is a country with only one party . 
  cmon the only opposition that we have is the linke . 
  cdu spd gr\u00fcne fdp is all the same for me ...
