  - . - * i know what u wan na say my friend . 
  anyone who dislike the government is a nazi . 
  even if he is not ... 
  lol the downvotes . 
  some facts : ** 1 million ppl in retraining and advanced training ** are not in the statistic . 
  ** 1.4 million `` aufstocker '' ** are ppl who work like 4h/week are not in the statistic . 
  ** anyone without a job over 56 years ** is not in the statistic . 
  ** anyone without a job who is ill ** is not in the statistic . 
  the propaganda from our government cant be more implausible . 
  maybe its a sign for a regime change . 
  that would be great . 
  i prefer a direct democracy like switzerland or at least a dictatorship . 
  anything is better as the shit that we have today . 
  only if all would agree to learn the most spoken native language in eu . 
  [ this one !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_language ), 
  looks more like the socialist realism . 
  today they accuse the afd to be communist . 
  tomorrow they are nationalistic again . 
  yes it is for a single person that came alone . 
  the first 3 months they get everything for free . 
  the 143 $ is for cigarettes and stuff . 
  then they have to pay for their food and clothing themselves . 
   around 120 $ a month 143 $ for the first three months . 
  then 359 $ and after 15 months 392 $, 
  why do all care about the number of deaths ? 
  every year hundreds die while trying to come to the united states and nobody cares . 
  dying of thirst is still worse than drowning . 
  it 's a cycle , every 25 years the temperature rises by a half degree then it drops again . 
  if you look at the correct years , then global warming is true . 
  that 's why they always show something between 1977-2003 . 
  no one wants that greece pay its debts . 
  it 's all just about the interest . 
  would the greek debt will also be converted in drachma ? 
  would an inflation of the drachma by 50 % reduce the debt of greece by 50 % too ? 
  * ** germany ** * 1-3 is ok * 4-5 were they all planned ??? 
  * 5 + you are crazy, 
  england is just bitching around like they always did . 
  hey northern ireland , scotland and wales wan na anschluss to the euro zone ? 
  cheap currency in relation to its own old currency . 
  if foreign products are cheaper than the local products , then no one will buy the local products . 
  the north of italy is like germany , it is benefiting from the euro . 
  but the south of italy is like greece . 
  but they were all once french . 
  at least in the good old days of the colonies, 
  the problem with the euro is simple : different economies have become one . 
  the north have to revalue its currency , or the south have to devalue its currency . 
  but that is no longer . 
  the solution would be a permanent financial compensation . 
  but that will never happen , at least not in the long run . 
  but the good thing is that the north benefits from the situation . 
  cheap euro more exports . 
  in the south it is the other way round . 
  cheap euro more imports . 
  because the economic infrastructure is way behind the north . 
  damn i should not watch the pic . 
  now i wan na go swimming . 
  i thought it would be possible because so many words sound alike . 
  only the spelling is completely different, 
  i heard that many young dutch prefer to speak english than dutch . 
  the people in the us are so much more religious and at the same time much more tolerant . 
  that does not make any sense . 
  religious people always see themselves as something better, 
  would it be possible to replace the written dutch language with german ? 
  just as swiss german with a few own words . 
  i 've never understood the mcdonalds tax system . 
  if you go in germany to a restaurant and eat there , then you pay 19 % taxes . 
  but if you order the food to go , then it is only 7 % taxes . 
  however prices are always the same . 
  do you know about the [ 29th waffen grenadier division of the ss rona ( 1st russian ) ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_rona_%281st_russian%29 ), 
  dancing on the tables, 
  if the d\u00f6ner is a turkish invention , then any invention in the united states is a european . 
  btw kebab is greek . 
  sorry dude it is impossible to discover something new on reddit , if you do not comment on it . 
  1-2 weeks ago on r/mapporn ... 
  and no bananas :(, 
  i saw a map of the united states here on reddit . 
  in was shown how many people work for the government . 
  people from the states had declared that the us army is in some areas the largest employer . 
  especially in the midwest edit : please do not get me wrong . 
  the united states is not a communist country , it is only an example of how communism works, 
  haha nice one . 
  it is kinda true . 
  but at least everyone has a roof over one 's head and enough to eat . 
  example in the united states : in some areas everyone is working for the us army . 
  if the us government is insolvent , all fucked . 
  we can change very quickly . 
  there is time of anschluss, 
  communism for beginners : everyone is working for the government . 
  advantage : safe life . 
  no unemployment and poverty . 
  disadvantage : mismanagement of the government fucks everyone , because there is only one company . 
  [ balfour declaration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balfour_declaration )  the balfour declaration ( dated 2 november 1917 ) was a letter from the united kingdom 's foreign secretary arthur james balfour to walter rothschild , 2nd baron rothschild , a leader of the british jewish community , for transmission to the zionist federation of great britain and ireland . 
   it read : his majesty 's government view with favour the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people , and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object , it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in palestine , or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country . 
  all the people who go crazy about twitter or facebook posts have never been on youtube or liveleak ... 
  what is the biggest advantage and disadvantage of a brexit for gb ? 
  haha nice one , 
  the translation sucks . 
  the euro is just too cheap for germany,
