  or , as said , the greece crisis . 
  not only do a lot of other countries hide behind sch\u00e4uble ( it was not germany that actually insisted on collateral from greece , that was finland ) , but it is quietly understood that once germany supports any kind of solution jointly with greece , it will once again be merkel 's task to convince the baltics . 
  that is not to say that germany 's behavior on any of these issues could n't be better , but the constant focus on germany annoys me . 
  we also seem to kinda have a solidarity problem in europe where many countries are big on demanding solidarity , but not so big on giving it ... 
  bavaria still has them iirc . 
  oh , we also send the bagger 288 after the more extreme cases . 
  just thought you wanted to know . 
  that 's a vote in the human rights council . 
  sc has 15 members ( p5 +10 temporary ) . 
  the human rights council has been accused of being biased a number of times , with pretty shady countries being in it and it focusing on israel a lot . 
  not sure whether the p5 have veto over there too , whether there is a unanimity requirement or whether that vote actually passed despite the red light at the top right . 
  googling the title of the resolution will bring up a reddit thread linking to [ this ] ( http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/us-only-country-of-47-to-vote-against-investigating-possible-human-rights-violations-during-israeli-occupation-of-gaza-140728?news=853817 ) article . 
  noted  i am not familiar with your history with this user ( who needs a flair very urgently given that the name sounds greek but the arguments sound bavarian ) , i think there could be some disconnect between you two in this : you argue that of course german exposure to greek debt has been significant ( and that , i think , is not disputable ) , while they argue that french exposure has been even bigger , in particular after factoring in relative sizes of economies . 
  the motive behind pointing this out being that this crisis can not and should not be reduced to a conflict solely between greece and germany . 
  this has been annoying me , too , both over the last years and more so in the recent weeks . 
  there have been a fair number of quite hostile comments to german ( y | s ) . 
  i considered mentioning that in my reply to you in the other thread but i decided that would look silly . 
  i think this sub urgently needs to calm down a bit though . 
  even though the situation is tense , the hostility does not help the discussion . 
  yeah , got it , thanks !, 
  i edited the info into my comment , let me know if this is not what you meant . 
  now i have to read . 
  on first glance at least it seems that indeed france was more exposed to greece , but germany outdoes france with respect to exposure towards ireland . 
  well , keep going . 
  i remember having some nice discussions with you in the past , so it would be a shame to lose you . 
  if you could send it again once you are on a normal computer i would be much obliged . 
  went a fair bit through your history and could n't find it . 
  i 'm curious what you mean ; i was always under the impression that the exposure of french banks was larger than those of german banks initially . 
  edit : / u/naurgul refers to [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jmmlzb9.png ) graphic , which was referenced in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2w38gr/foreign_exposures_to_greece_ireland_portugal_and/ ) reddit post sourced by [ this ] ( http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1103b.pdf ) bis report . 
  supposedly it 's from [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_accomplishment ) book . 
  the borders make literally no sense : they largely follow contemporary borders , but germany is shown with imperial borders minus the alsace and northern sleswig , but with congress poland annexed in one picture . 
  the fuck ? 
  yeah do n't worry . 
  in a situation as tense and heated as this it only takes a few hotheads to make incidents happen . 
  different issue . 
  of course greece needs more money very short term or the lights will go out , probably on the 20th . 
  that 's a short term problem . 
  however , assuming that greece can get another bailout to avoid bankruptcy , and even if the economy somehow recovers , the mountain of debt is still so high that greece has no real hope to reduce it to a reasonable amount in the next 50 years . 
  that 's what debt restructuring is for . 
  it 's not urgent to do it this week or next week or even this year ( debt is owned by `` the institutions '' , so it 's a political question , not an economic issue . 
  interest payment burden is also not unsustainable ) , but at some point a plan will have to be made to allow greece to reduce its debt burden to a reasonable level . 
  i still think that debt restructuring should be tied to medium term reform goals . 
  create a functioning land registry by 2018 ? 
  $ 5 billion of debt forgiven . 
  visible improvements in tax collection rate by 2020 ? 
  $ 10 billion gone . 
  measurable , independently verified progress in fight against corruption ? 
  $ 20 billion make poof . 
  numbers and goals to be determined by actual experts . 
  that way , greece gets a realistic way to get rid of a good chunk of their debt and the creditors do n't have to give it to greece for free , but can tell people that greece has to work for it . 
  such a proposal actual syncs very well with the `` greece has been bad and must better itself '' narrative without actual economic pain . 
  oh , and as a bonus undeniably useful reforms occur in greece . 
  i still wonder why nobody has brought up such a proposal . 
  or a comic where countries are represented by round versions of their flags . 
  someone should make a subreddit for that . 
  prosecutors ask : do you know [ this ] ( http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120224045330-vladimir-putin-motorbike-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg ) man ? 
  can i get a refund ? 
  sorry i ca n't hear you from my comet over here . 
  in the case of cabs the driver is doing more than driving though . 
  they take your request ( which may be from someone who only speaks english ( possibly broken ) , is drunk and forgot where he slept for the night ) , ensure you are well , stop right there if you need to vomit , have conversation , etc. 
  you do n't need it on all trips , but i do n't think completely automating cabs is a necessarily a good thing . 
  computer assisted driving is cool , of course . 
  i do n't think so , but it 's generally consensus that promotion of a very old-school family model is driving this . 
  most of the rest of germany hates it . 
  firstly , they roughly mark the boundary of democraticy party landscape to the political right in germany . 
  as a left-leaning person , they are , of course , the political enemy . 
  secondly , the csu often puts their state ( bavaria ) before reasonable politics and they do n't shy away from cheap populism . 
  examples from recent past include bavaria very much wanting cheap energy from wind farms far in the north , but actually not wanting those ugly power lines in their state ( and proposing these largely go through a neighboring state ) . 
  another example is the `` temporary '' storage of spent nuclear fuel , which bavaria has used extensively but the waste better go in different states pretty please . 
  not even mentioning crazy reactionary shit coming out of bavaria for populist reasons that gets passed for peace 's sake ( road toll , paying stay-at-home moms , etc ) . 
  i hate the csu with a passion and we really need to cede bavaria ( sans franconia ) to austria and then somehow mend relations with austria after the fact . 
  / u/neutrolgreek is a staunch proponent of the idea that greece should align themselves with russia and that russia will bail them out . 
  at least a few months ago he also said that could be done without getting kicked from the eu because cyprus would veto any such kick . 
  i do n't think this is a likely course of events , but we will see . 
  csu guilty of being an `` eldritch monstrosity from beyond time and space '' - yup . 
  well , i can see the annoyance , but i do n't think it 's that big of a deal . 
  writing stuff bilingual is / u/dclauzel 's gimmick here so i am willing to cut him some slack . 
  and i do n't see how all that outrage is useful in face of a possibly bad-done megathread . 
  maybe i 'm just too relaxed for the weekend , 
   so because somebody 's english is bad it 's acceptable to annoy the entire community [ ... ] my impression is that people need to relax more . 
  bad english is commonplace in europe . 
  how is this worth a shitstorm ? 
  the swiss would never [ invade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liechtenstein%e2%80%93switzerland_relations#incidents_involving_the_swiss_military ) liechtenstein . 
  stop being silly . 
  we should make it so that russia pays all the budget overruns and then we let the berlin airport guys manage the project . 
  forget the sanctions , we will have russia bankrupt in ~ ~ two weeks ~ ~ ~ ~ a year ~ ~ ~ ~ 2019 ~ ~ at some point in the future . 
  i know that , but i think contrary to the republican colors , nobody cares about the inaccuracy , but it gets the message across . 
  omelet and eggs i guess , 
  nobody denies that ( and i actually specifically said it in my post ) . 
  it 's about the impression that modern germany in fact still perpetuates genocide . 
  ( and it 's a moot point since that image apparently is not going to be used ), 
   hey i had never thought about that !, 
  it could be forgotten rather than whitewashed ( despite it having been the first time the axis would display their full might in anticipation for wwii ) . 
  your answer is pretty good !, 
  thanks . 
  thank you !, 
  and do n't hesitate to call people out . 
  i have n't seen any , but whitewashing does happen sometimes . 
  like labeling massacres `` a legitimate military action '' or the like , that has happened before . 
   yeah , do n't worry about it .
