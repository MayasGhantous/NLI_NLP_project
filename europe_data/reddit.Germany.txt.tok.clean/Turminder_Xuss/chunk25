  i 'm not independentist but i am proud of my language . 
  i also try to say other countries cities in their language rather than use english for them . 
  you are a brave person , 
  well , another user told me that it 's going to go ahead without the current colors , which is fine . 
  i can see why it offends polish people and why some think `` better put a stop to this now before it becomes too big '' . 
  nice to hear that the discussion here is factored in , that seems quite mature to me . 
  well , that 's not surprising given that it hits a similar problem and we outnumber you guys 2:1  if you have n't done already , maybe make a top level comment clarifying that the campaign will only use the other 4 ? 
  that sould be upvoted pretty fast and could stop some of the outrage , 
  b-but my pitchfork ?!, 
  good to hear that it 's not going to be included . 
  do read through what i wrote though : i have no issue with the campaign per se and i am aware of the problem . 
   mostly apologists that say that while the nazi were terrible at least they never carpet bombed cities like the allies did with hamburg , kolm or dresden . 
  let me find you a link that is n't from some fascist blog . 
  even if the attack on gernika had never happened ( and the one on coventry , for what it 's worth ) that would still be an extraordinarily dumb thing to say . 
  to suggest that of all the crimes committed during wwii , the `` moral bombing '' would be the worst would be pretty dumb . 
  i agree that denying that it happened would be like `` polish death camps '' , but consider this : someone saying this might very well be unaware of it . 
  the spanish civil war and the legion condor do appear in school books ( usually together with the picasso painting and the picture that is on the english wp page ) , but given the length of the german laundry list of massacres and genocides most people probably forget that for some , wwii did start before 1939 . 
  so it might be ignorance rather than a purposeful attempt at whitewashing . 
  most germans also know nothing about the herrero genocide . 
  of course you would be right to call out an expert or someone who has done research leaving out the gernika attack . 
   also , minor nitpick , could you call it gernika ? 
  not independentist or anything , just its the correct name . 
  sorry , it never occurred to me that this might be located in basque country ( is it okay to call it like that in english ? ) . 
  given your flag i should have made the connection . 
  take my apologies !, 
  not sure whether you are affiliated with that action or not , but i 'll give it a go  if you guys feel that this is a problem that needs to be addressed , by all means , do so . 
  however , like many others in this thread i would heavily recommend to drop the one using the present german colors . 
  here is why : it has a similar problem as `` polish death camps '' . 
  polish people are rightfully offended by that phrase because it suggests that polish people had a hand in these , even though the only link is that they happen to be on polish territory . 
  similarly , linking the death camps to * postwar * germany is also problematic : it suggests that postwar and modern germany still is in the death camp business . 
  that is a deeply insulting thing to say , in particular to a younger german who had nothing to do with it and still have to deal with the fallout . 
  my suggestion would be to replace the colors by something that is still recognizable as german ( e.g. , fraktur type ) but does n't suggest modern germany is in it . 
  because it 's perfectly fine to make the link to german history and press for german responsibility ( and no one tries to deny that ) . 
  but dragging black-red-gold into it is a mistake . 
  i fear that if the second one goes up here , it has serious potential to generate anti-polish sentiment instead of making aware of an issue ( which is a shame because the last three images are pretty well done ) . 
  so among friends : go ahead , but drop the second one . 
  could you provide an example of whitewashing with respect to ~ ~ guernica ~ ~ gernika ? 
  it 's certainly not as known as stuff as auschwitz , but i am unaware of any whitewashing attempts . 
  oh no , he is onto us . 
  quickly , execute operation sandkastenparty !, 
  thanks !, 
  hoping new horizons goes well too . 
  i read that it will pass pluto in the next months . 
  should be handled on a case by case base . 
  when it comes to things like glorious universal phone chargers or sanctioning russia , that is the power of the single market at work , and that is really the whole eu ( + norway etc ) . 
  when it comes to monetary policy , for example , you are absolutely right that the comparison should be between the ez and the us . 
  and when it comes to things like power projection , the correct level would be individual countries ( read : france and the uk ) . 
  generally , the eu acts as in unison often in areas of soft power ( legislation , economy , diplomacy ) and rarely in hard power ( e.g. , bombing brown people ) . 
  obviously , when it comes to a pissing contest , the natural thing is to pick the biggest possible stick and clearly yurop # 1 in gdp . 
  they did that when it landed . 
  it was beautiful . 
  no , the report op posted does not conclusively prove that russia shopped their pics . 
  what it shows is that ( unless you believe digital globe to shop pics or bellingcat to flat out lie ) is that russia has presented pictures that are wrongly dated and which do n't support russia 's narrative . 
  whether russia shopped in the buk or not is still not conclusively proved ( although russia 's story becomes quite thinner because the buk they claimed to be on that road was at it 's base all the time ) . 
  i expect bellingcat to bring a followup on that too . 
  of course , if is quite telling that / u/buckfost tries to discredit bellingcat 's methodology without having actually looked into the report ( which is about the third time this happens in this thread ) . 
  dunno , wp says it 's [ * not * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_day#name ) the independence day , but rather an assertion of sovereignty . 
  i remember reading that elsewhere , too . 
  so that is how you get all the perks , but none of the liabilities of being a successor state . 
  is there a way to do that retroactively for , let 's say 70 years ? 
  asking for a friend , of course . 
  yes , i know  valid criticism , that report was definitely not up to the usual standards . 
  this report ( together with another that came out the other day ) is meant to support the claims ( not the methodology ) of the report that is criticized in those tweets . 
  yo , these tweets are from june first . 
  how can that debunk something that came out * today * ? 
  do n't waste your steam , this is a new report , which came out today . 
  no such thing as cloud analysis , it 's just actual satellite footage which does n't match russian footage . 
  i 'm curious how `` experts '' have deemed this report `` fake '' in just over 4 hours , so maybe / u/muncher32 can shed some light . 
  you do n't happen a reference to those expert 's utterings ? 
  edit : / u/muncher32 has posted in the interim and must be concluded to be a phony . 
  too 19th century . 
  what about a coin commemorating the last game in old wembley ? 
  but the other solution is more efficient ? 
  how can you not see the light ? 
  there [ is ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fwie_titanic_einmal_die_fu%25c3%259fball-wm_2006_nach_deutschland_holte&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) hard evidence in the case of germany 2006 . 
   not the only , border in europe to be decided on popular vote popular vote my ass , it was decided by gerrymandering !, 
  hundreds of thousands were depraved of their rightful heritage of low vat , cheap booze , ordnung , historical guilt and four world cup wins instead of that one shitty euro win that was n't even earned properly !, 
  but not to worry , the 100th anniversary will come up and then we will put right what was set wrong . 
  up ewig ungedeelt !, 
  but in the meantime : we bring the beer , you bring p\u00f8lse ? 
   edit : actually this may be the newest : [ m1a2-sep v2 with tusk ii crows 2 ] ( http://www.bestdreamworks.com/hobby/items/602//h2.jpg ) ( yes that 's officially what the latest configuration of the abrams is called . ), 
  am i seeing this wrong or does it really have a turret on the turret ? 
  no that 's perfectly fine . 
  there is jewish ethnicity ( e.g. , ashkenazi jewish ) and jewish religion and you can be part of either group without the other ( simplified ) . 
  having `` jewish '' as ethnicity reeks of nazi craziness but i 've seen a lot of jews use it as well and wikipedia agrees , 
  yes , but actually the number is surprisingly low ( around 5 % i think ) because most greek debt has been rolled over into `` institutions '' held debt far below market rates . 
  in a nutshell , the greek budget is no longer subject to market constraints ( borrowing costs and the like ) but to political constraints ( because it more or less exists at the whim of the creditors ) . 
  the primary surplus requirement for greece ( 4.5 % ) was really insane and it holds back the greek economy . 
  every percent that it 's lowered is a godsend for greece . 
  together with the reports that germany and france might push for the fiscal union , this seems like good news . 
  i will only believe it when i see it , but may just maybe finally some sense is coming into european leaders . 
  german media quoting `` dow jones '' that the primary surplus requirement is being lowered to 1 % this year , 2 % next year and 3 % in 2017 . 
  that would be really good news imho . 
  in german it 's sometimes dubbed `` orgasmus-programm '' . 
  technically not , since he only promised it in case one of the big sponsors pulls out , but i 'm sure he 'll be a good sport . 
  yeah you are right , `` learner driver '' probably refers to the trial period after getting the license . 
  i was already wondering why the supposed instructor did n't stop the car in time ... 
  no more leopards for you !, 
  yeah on second thought the trails in the second picture are probably not brake marks but sanded over oil trails . 
   over egging the pudding the english language never ceases to amaze me ,
