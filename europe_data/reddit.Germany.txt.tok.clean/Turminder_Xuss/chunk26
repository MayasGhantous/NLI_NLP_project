  i think it came from the right , if you look at the second picture with the brake marks . 
  mind you we drive on the right  the turret not being reversed had me confused as well but near a base maybe they had a reason to drive with the turret forward . 
  it also looks like the tank had the right of way because ( in increasing order of relevance ) * right before left * minor road yields to larger road * hatchback yields to tank or else , 
  for everyone still struggling : [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/wkv78ge ), 
  it 's a driving school car so it probably has a set of pedals for the instructor . 
  edit : [ apparently it 's not a driving school car ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/387axe/british_tank_crushes_learner_drivers_car_in/crt2lzo ), 
  october . 
  i 've head people claim september but i think october is the better bet . 
  it 's still at least criminal negligence . 
  commercial airlines cruise at speed/altitude combinations that no military plane in ua arsenal can achieve . 
  even if they could n't see this ( because they were operating on a lone telar ) , there are still easily available tools out there ( e.g. 
  flightradar24 ) to check for civilian aircraft in the vicinity . 
  and they knew there were civilian aircraft there because a lufthansa plane passed through 15 minutes earlier . 
  this could easily have been avoided . 
  do n't worry , we do it to holland too . 
  it 's in german . 
  so it probably went like [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwgwegxmvu ), 
  it says ( bish . ), 
  in front of the name . 
  that stands for `` bisheriger '' and means something on the lines of `` outgoing '' . 
  collaborators !!!, 
   germans love bland , boring and predicable stuff the stuff you are posting would be an absolute cracker over here . 
  invading iraq was always wrong . 
  it was clear that it was wrong back then and it is clear now , and it was clear that w and cronies were lying . 
  in this case i would assume yes , but amazon earns a lot of money with stuff different than german books ( buchpreisbindung does n't affect foreign books ) . 
  funny thing is that , at least with books , amazon can not raise prices in germany . 
  buchpreiisbindung = german books cost the same everywhere . 
  all else is fair game though . 
  probably they are not , but as i said , the system is not designed to accurately rank entries at the bottom of the table ( heck , greece will always get some points from cyprus , so they can never have 0 points ) . 
  what the votes say is that europe liked the swedish entry , liked the russian one almost as much and then the italian one again a bit less . 
  also i just noticed your username is very relevant , 
   that just goes to show the douze points system is outdated and does n't work if 27 nations are competing ... only if you are interested in accurately ranking all entries . 
  the system is pretty good at selecting a winner that is universally liked across europe , and that 's good enough for me . 
  it 's a bit harsh for the singer but i do n't mind us being last sometimes . 
  wait , she sung in english ? 
  conflict . 
  russian song pretty good . 
  on the other hand , they are mordor . 
  what do ... 
  effective solutions . 
  dunno , but israel is in uefa , ebu , votes with the weu group in the un and so on . 
  of course the chinese could n't care less , but the arab nations surrounding israel do care . 
  dunno , i liked your song this year . 
  probably not going to win but definitely not last place material imho . 
  there is also [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_legislative_election,_2011#statistics ), 
  german commentary is more for a family event . 
  i prefer the international version , but eurovision.tv is down and the youtube stream is ... tada ... blocked in germany ... 
  ebu membership . 
  israel often goes with european organizations because the asian organizations hate their guts . 
  also , [ dana international .

  joke 's on you , brazil will be in favor of it , coz g ~ ~ ondor ~ ~ ermany never wins in ~ ~ minas morgul ~ ~ russia . 
  or something like that , 
  everything is possible in esc performances ... 
  yo , this backstabbing thingy , can that be done with a broomstick ? 
  asking for a friend . 
   in france , napoleon is n't considered like the crazy despot some other countries do funny . 
  i wo n't claim to speak for all germany but for me the napoleon time always was in the realm of distant history . 
  you learn about the french revolution as an important historic event ( and the positives and the negatives ) but the narrative about mister n. is always that he was a military genius that at some point got a bit greedy and led france into a bid for world domination . 
  but it 's also accepted that that is what countries kinda did back then . 
  maybe that is because we have our own bid for world domination in a much more recent time , but i do n't recall napoleon being seen portrayed as evil of any kind . 
  you would be surprised . 
  on a recent birthday party there was a present of one million reichsmarks , supposedly genuine . 
  so i guess 476 of them should n't be too hard to get . 
  no [ r.i.p.uli ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwyhfjmiy8w ) ? 
   a bit late to ask for that now ? 
  as far as i know greece has been asking for reparations in steady intervals since the end of the war . 
  before 1990 west germany declined because we were basically only half a country . 
  and after 1990 they are told `` too late '' . 
   but germanys response is even more interesting , they point to the 2plus4 agreement , but if you read the agreement it says nothing about reparations http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm the german logic is that the reparations issue was postponed until after a peace treaty in the london debt conference and that the peace treaty never came because the 2 +4 treaty is there `` instead of a peace treaty '' , so the reparations issue is moot . 
  now you ca n't make treaties to the disadvantage of third parties , but almost all european nations then `` acknowledged '' ( or something like that ) the 2 +4 treaty in the csce final act , so the logic is that greece waived their right to reparations right there , the german government says . 
  moreover , greece apparently asked again for reparations only in 1995 , and i have read people claim that this was way too late after 2 +4 to let the claim live . 
  so it 's not entirely clear whether greece still has a claim or not . 
   so greece might have a valid claim ? 
  might . 
  note that besides the legal dimension , this also has a moral dimension ( should n't germany pay greece even if there is no claim , just to set things right ? 
  should greece really demand reparations from taxpayers who are 2 or 3 generations away from wwii ? ), 
  and one of political strategy ( germany wants to avoid to set precedents in order to not have to pay half of europe , greece might want to avoid an open clash with germany because that would almost certainly make the political wiggle room for other concessions to greece disappear ) . 
  moreover , there is also that forced loan thing ( where i think greece is basically out of luck ) and the matter of compensation to individuals , like with the distomo massacre ( where i think the german position is a disgrace and we should pay asap ) . 
  so basically , it 's a clusterfuck . 
  i disagree . 
  1upt has so many gameplay implications that just do n't work in a game like civ ( for example , civ v had to throttle production in comparison to iv to avoid clogging up the map with units , and then they had to tack on stuff to make the early turns less boring , etc , etc. ) . 
  i do n't mind the hexes ( although i prefer the squares , but hexes definitely * look * better ) , but if 1upt would go i would be so happy . 
  no , we need the one that flies for ourselves . 
  ask france !, 
  i dunno , i remember that some high-ranking albanian politician talked about the `` reunification '' of albania and kosovo , juncker or some other top ranking eu official told them in no uncertain terms to fuck off . 
  made the front page on / r/europe . 
  that `` flag drone '' thing during a football match made the top 10 news of tagesschau ( german public news service ) . 
  that incident on macedonia the other day also [ made the top 10 ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tagesschau.de%2fausland%2fmazedonien-107.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) , * despite * the 70 year anniversary of the war ending , germany having state elections in bremen , the president of israel coming to celebrate 50 years of official diplomatic relations , the bnd scandal and other domestic stuff . 
  what more do you want ? 
  the world to stop and look at albanian irredentism ? 
  the eu extension commissioner commented on it and that 's enough . 
  our leaders are busy being sorry for that war we started ( i am not going to search for the reports on the other incidents , but i am sure they were being commented on ) . 
  many countries do n't recognize israel 's incorporation of the entirety of jerusalem into israel proper and have their embassy in tel aviv . 
  just one facet of this conflict . 
   this is kind of a shame for afd . 
  it is somewhat surprising that afd are n't able to capitalise on the eurozone crisis and what is going on with greece and the demise of the fdp ... merkel soaking up all the votes right of the center i would say and people being reluctant to vote `` brownish '' parties hinders them . 
  and germany profiting off all the shenanigans in conjunction with the euro . 
  i mean , they came quite close a few times ( just shy of the 5 % hurdle in general elections , and they are in a few state parliaments ) it 's just that all political voices get drowned with the grand coalition we have right now .
