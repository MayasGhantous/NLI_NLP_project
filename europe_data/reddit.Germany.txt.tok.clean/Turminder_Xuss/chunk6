  since most of our fundamental rights have exceptions , lawmakers quickly drafted up a law that basically said : for religious reasons ( i.e. , muslims , jews ) , circumcision is okay , as long as it is done under qualified medical supervision ( which is not that hard to get for religious communities ) . 
  i think that 's a good solution . 
  what was the outrage about again ? 
  joke 's on you , we have secret facilities where out top intelligence officials train to pronounce `` squirrel '' around the clock . 
  secret , non-detectable implants have made it possible for germans to accomplish this feat . 
  nothing can stop us now !, 
  yes , and then russia joins nato and the us air force bomb the chinese into oblivion while a chinese nuke attack on washington , dc is stopped by a random navy ship on the potomac . 
  i , too , read a few tom clancy novels when i was young . 
   speak english no problem , that 's my work day . 
   watch american movies i can live with that , i 'm not the most sophisticated person . 
   eat out at mcdonalds never . 
  to the death . 
  germany # 1 at world order . 
  bow to your new \u00dcberherrscher !!, 
  ! 11111 ( this means we finally get world domination , right ? ), 
  so 12 world cups by german math . 
  english weather . 
  whatever , we can take it . 
  i do n't think it 's a useful thing to measure a nation by it 's worst ( also germany would do really bad in that category ) . 
  that may be true , but if a nato member is attacked and invokes article 5 , the german public does n't have any say in what happens . 
  poland , i think , has it 's glory days yet to come . 
  for the first time since millennia , at least half of the border is inhabited by allies , and this time , * we will come for you * . 
  poland is now a democracy , has free markets , and it 's generally around and kicking . 
  poland does n't [ need ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_wizna ) [ to ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_curie ) [ prove ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banach ) their [ worth ] ( http://www.labri.fr/perso/igw/ ) to the world . 
  they [ kick ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogdan_wenta ) ass . 
  in any way , poland is now part of the team . 
  nothing made me more proud of europe , when , during the ukrainian crisis , some german news message was `` the foreign ministers of the weimar triangle have ... '' - poland , france , germany doing work . 
  never mind it did n't work out , i love poland is pulling their weight * and * defending their interests . 
  there was a period where poland was very whiny ( we want x and because wwii we should get it ) - no more . 
  poland is now confident in themselves , they play in the team , * and i love it * . 
  they deserve to flourish , and we * want * them to flourish . 
  welcome back , poland . 
  i like . 
  what i meant was that it feels like the british create conflict way too often , and they draw way too many red lines . 
  at some point it does n't really pay off anymore to try to incorporate dissenting opinions if they just crop up over so many things ( and over things so petty as `` pls no blue and yellow at wwi commemorations '' ) . 
  if the uk seem to throw a tantrum over too many things , at some point a body as large as the eu has to abandon unanimity and move over to some form of ( qualified ) majority vote . 
  yes , it 's unfair to not include the interests of minorities , but it feels also * very * unfair if a minority wields consensus based `` veto power '' too frequently . 
  at some point there will need to be a talk , or the majority will have to move on ( which of course risks breaking the relationship permanently ) . 
  edit : think of filibusters in the us senate , in particular the threat to filibuster a bill ( where you do n't have to do anything but to threaten to do it ) . 
  if that threat is used too often , the majority might feel that this clogs up legislature too much and either dare the threatening senator to do it and then try to organize a motion to cloture or just change senate protocol . 
  i hold generally favorable opinions on the uk . 
  my post was referring to uk leadership , i thought that would be clear from context . 
  the way the uk handle their uk-eu relation has become an annoyance . 
  seriously , the british are starting to piss me off . 
  if you want to renegotiate eu membership , fine . 
  but do n't make a battle out of * everything * . 
  if the uk goes on to behave like they just got into puberty , at some point the rest of europe will just start to ignore them , say `` fuck consensus '' and make decisions against expressed british will . 
  edit : since it has been said by a few : `` the british '' refers to the british leadership . 
  i generally like britain as such . 
  germany and merkel is often also referred to as `` the germans '' and i also have to live with that . 
  that algorithm * loves * to make you singaporean . 
  i was also a bit undecided on `` read chemistry '' . 
  it 's grammatically correct in my opinion , but it does n't mean the same : if you read chemistry , you are a professor . 
  anyway , i think i screwed up that algorithm : our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  new zealandish 2 . 
  welsh ( uk ) 3 . 
  singaporean ( i always thought that i speak american english ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  greek 2 . 
  turkish 3 . 
  to be honest , i got my personal peace with `` american '' from this german [ article ] ( http://www.possum.in-berlin.de/texts/us-amerikanisch.html ) by american-german ( can you say that  scot stevenson . 
  in any way , my personal experience has made `` american '' totally unambiguous , except if you speak spanish to a latin american , in which case you use `` norteamericano '' or `` yanqui '' . 
  problem solved . 
  edit : ca n't get that frickin ' hyperlink to work . 
  i suck . 
  extra edit : figured out how to do a link . 
  if you want tot come after my karl may books , fight me mate . 
  1v1 me at dragon ! 1111, 
  you know you may be neutral but you are still between us and the french !!!, 
  ! 11 ahem . 
  that may all be correct , but `` american '' usually means `` from the us '' . 
  here in germany we have this weird `` us-american '' thingy which always strikes me as slightly anti-american . 
  if you say `` american '' , everybody knows you refer to the us , except in very special circumstances where it 's usually clear from context that the continent is referred to . 
  newsflash : tiger tanks are outdated . 
  yes but only because they did n't give us right of passage . 
  well we still could do it . 
  but imagine the confusion if we told to that unit `` go and attack the netherlands '' - `` wait , what ? 
  well , [ importing monarchs from germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_of_greece ) is kind of a greek tradition . 
  also exports ftw !, 
  i disagree . 
  as far as i know , the soviets would have won the war even without the normandy landings . 
  it would have been more bloody for them and probably it would have taken longer , but there was no winning against the russians for hitler . 
  the eastern front was already in full retreat . 
  what the normandy landings did is take a bit of pressure from the red army and , more importantly , make sure the red army did not go all the way to paris . 
  it is worth pointing out that even though the soviets could probably have won the war without allied landings in europe , they certainly needed the lend-lease support . 
  just in case people think `` lol america did n't do anything in wwii '' , which would be just as wrong . 
  yes . 
  she also had a very important job at lunch today : she sat between hollande and putin . 
  german quality media keeping us up to date . 
   we 'll either become a big player within europe or americas bitch . 
  come on , big player in europe gon na be us . 
  we tried so hard for so long , we * have * to win zis time . 
  we also shall be benevolent overlords . 
  we shall teach you the proper temperature of beer , the proper lane to drive on , and the proper speed limit ( hint : none ) . 
  we shall combine the baked beans and the sauerkraut into the most formidable culinary weapon that has ever existed . 
  call it weapon of mass flatulence if you will . 
  of course , there will be adaptions to be made . 
  you already know hoe to queue , so marching wo n't be that bad . 
  the punctuality thing we will work out , you will learn penalties and surely queen merkel does n't sound that bad ^ * - your harry prince already seems to know the drill . 
  so why fight the irresistible ? 
  ^ * shudder,
