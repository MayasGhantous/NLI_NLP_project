  moreover , in the yugoslav breakup wars , and then in the kosovo war , serbia was `` the enemy '' of the western troops . 
  that sticks , even if it 's not true . 
  i do think though that this sentiment will go away with time . 
  at some point in the not too distant future serbia will join the eu , and people will slowly come to realize that serbia is n't so evil after all . 
  i mean , germany was pretty hated at some point and we are now one of the most popular countries in the world . 
  if we can turn this motherfucker around , you can too . 
  however , i do believe that there is a sizable group of serbians that fits / u/piwikiwi 's account . 
  i recently read that there are plans to erect a new monument to princip in belgrade , something that is not exactly helping , i feel , 
  i disagree . 
  i 'm a scientist , and english is great at communicating precisely what you mean . 
  it 's actually possible to be more precise and concise in english than it is in german . 
  spanish , on the other hand , needs almost 100 % more words to convey the same thing . 
  not for scientific purposes , art , documentation , humor , anti-nazi stuff ( striked out swastika ) and the like . 
  we are not the swastika-is-verboten nazis , if you will pardon the pun , 
  to extend on that , germany has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . 
  we are actually not allowed to have nukes . 
  in fact , germany has politely declined the french offer on joint control over the force de frappe twice now . 
  of course , if we wanted to , we could have nukes in a hurry , like any industrialized nation with a civilian nuclear program . 
  on military buildup , germany is limited by the 2 +4 treaty to just over 400k troops ( current strength is way less and projected to be reduced even more ) . 
  certainly , we could expand our military strength easily without going over the 400k , but the current political climate is not precisely open to an arms buildup . 
  i do , however , support an intervention of the bundeswehr on mallorca to protect eh local german speaking population at the pools and beaches against british aggression , 
  again ? 
  sorry we do n't like them russians in berlin . 
  but we can attack them together if you want to . 
  hell , lets do the unthinkable and * not * attack the french , rather get them into our team ... let 's meet at k\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz to carve out a strategy , kk ? 
  love , prussia :-) < 3, 
  well , we wanted a commemorative hitler coin , but austria refused to mint it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yougetitbecausehitlerwasaustrian, 
  did n't exist before , does now . 
  \u00df\u00e4nk ju for travelink wiz deutsche bahn . 
  early nineties , end of eighties . 
  technically , under international law these territories were still part of germany until the 2 +4 treaty . 
  took them a while to update the maps of course . 
  no serious map shows germany in any but the present borders since well over twenty years , of course  the south american maps refer to the territories that ecuador had to cede to peru in 1942 under the rio de janeiro protocol . 
  they only just recently started to accept this , albiet grudgingly . 
  meh , would have put it one state down and two to the left if asked . 
  and i 'm not * that * bad with us states ... 
  when i was young , it said `` temporarily under soviet administration '' . 
  same went for parts of poland . 
  was interesting to revisit some of that stuff in south america . 
  can i get a joker and have james t. kirk 's home state marked ? 
  and sporcle . 
  2 wrong , one misclick . 
   that it 'd make more sense to just include us in the nordics . 
  his sausage factory will probably run without him . 
  his banking shenanigans in switzerland did not generate taxes in the first place , and he will probably have to participate in inmate labor ( making bags , repairing bikes etc. ), 
  anyway . 
  on second thought , the idea of uli hoeness `` am t\u00fcten kleben '' sounds hilarious to me . 
  surely they were not . 
  quite the contrary . 
  given my fairly limited historical knowledge , i see it a bit as a `` forced hand '' issue . 
  germany at that time was very paranoid about a two-front war , with the almost infinite manpower of russia on one side and the equally impenetrable french defenses on the other . 
  so when russia mobilized , germany was on a clock - take paris in ( roughly ) 40 days or lose ( france had not given the statement of neutrality it was asked to give ) . 
  so plans called to bypass the french defenses through belgium , which was just in the way . 
  and then the terrible logic of war with pre-made plans took over . 
  not that i condone that breach of treaty ( prussia actually guaranteed belgium 's borders in 1836 ) , or rape of belgium , if you want to call it so . 
  that was wrong , and it 's even more tragic in hindsight that imperial germany did * not * manage to take paris , but fought the russians to a standstill and then to defeat . 
  could have just sat there throwing insults to the french and taking the moral high ground . 
  but hindsight is 20/20 ... just saying because i see the `` they forced us '' preemptive logic cropping up again in the last decade or so . 
  it 's barely a 100 years and people start to forget the lessons learned from wwi . 
  has me scared when someone throws those from wwii over board . 
  that sounds more like a us thing : a recent public initiative asked lawmakers in the state of mississippi to repeal the laws of physics because `` they are limiting our freedom . 
  god bless america . '', 
   but maybe democracy means something else to ( some ) germans . 
  not the best way to get the moral high ground there imho . 
  `` was interessiert mich mein geschw\u00e4tz von gestern '' - `` i do n't care about my chitchat from yesterday '' - supposedly adenauer adopting a new position on something ( not sourced ) `` ich gebe ihnen mein ehrenwort , ich wiederhole , mein ehrenwort '' ... - `` i give you my word of honor , i repeat : my word of honor ... '' - uwe barschel , dismissing ( true ) accusations . 
  he resigned three weeks alter and was found dead in a bathtub in austria another week after . 
  `` wer visionen hat , soll zum arzt gehen '' - `` if you have visions , go to the doctor '' - pragmatic helmut schmidt `` bl\u00fchende landschaften '' - `` prospering lands '' - helmut hohl promising an economic miracle within a few years to the joining eastern states . 
  that miracle turned out to be quite slow in materializing . 
  `` uneingeschr\u00e4nkte solidarit\u00e4t '' - `` unlimited solidarity '' - gerhardt schr\u00f6der giving the us a carte blanche offer of support after 9/11 , he later campaigned successfully on germanies refusal to join the invasion of iraq ( but silently provided aid on form of basing rights , relieving the us on other duties and so on ) . 
  ironically , that was reported to trigger the nsa wiretapping the german chancellor , said a report last week . 
  as a personal note , i think german leaders should stop giving allies a promise of unlimited support ... 
  just like the falklands . 
  geographically it 's part of argentina , and spain even settled it first . 
  but there are british living there since hundreds of years . 
  if they want to stay british , so be it . 
  to expand on what others have said , i remember reading somewhere ( probably german wikipedia ) that gorbachev offered to give kaliningrad `` back '' to the unified germany , but kohl refused . 
  probably because there are no germans there anymore and having an exclave with poland inbetween would probably do more harm then help ( and set standards with respect to other formerly german territories , something * nobody * wants on both sides of oder-neisse . 
  edit : / u/tagedieb said it first [ here ] ( http://en.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1xakzu./thanks_russia_for_officially_returning/cfa2860 ), 
  i think you misunderstood him . 
  he said that , if seen in isolation , out of context , not expelling germans from predominantly german lands would have been preferable . 
  think eastern pomerania and east prussia , which had largely germans living there . 
  speaking specifically gdansk , that was a german city for many centuries and part of imperial germany until wwi . 
  now , if you see it in context , he said he understands what happened right after wwii , and it makes no sense at all to `` undo '' stalin 's doings after the fall of the iron curtain , because all these territories ( except kaliningrad ) are now parts of poland , with mostly polish people living there . 
  nobody except a few nut jobs is `` complaining '' . 
  well there is grandpa 's old war 101 . 
  lets see ... * step one : invade poland * step two : invade france * step three : invade russia * step four : get backstabbed by italy . 
  were the hell does the central african republic come on this list ? 
  my point was based on the pensions system , which is based on points . 
  more points = more pensions . 
  if you pay into the system exactly the yearly average contribution ( i.e. , if you make exactly average wage ) you get one point . 
  average gross wage is currently about $ 34k ( i checked because i wanted to know how much pensions i had earned after a year ) . 
  a yearly gross of $ 34k does not give you a monthly net wage of $ 2k . 
  of course , the pensions system does not take into account other types of work , e.g. , artists . 
  it also does n't consider civil servants ( beamte ) , who do not pay into the pensions system and some of them make good money . 
  however , it explicitly says `` wage '' , and neither of the latter groups gets wages . 
  so something is off . 
  dude . 
  that is clearly switzerland . 
  norway is the one with blue and yellow .
