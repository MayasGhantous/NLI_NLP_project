  how is that relevant ? 
  the question was whether or not germany had to pay reparations . 
  east germany most certainly did . 
  in the forms of its entire industry getting scrapped . 
  what are you referring to as edge exactly ? 
  your edit is pretty dumb . 
  the people of france are barely affected by anglo media as is . 
  east germany was stripped blank by the soviets from 1945 to 1949 . 
  what an atrocious lie . 
  breturn ? 
  if we use this term , nobody will want to return as they 'll be afraid of another stupid buzzword to make it into history books . 
  `` from brexit to breturn - the time of the 2010s ! '', 
  please do !, 
  i also hate the separation of power and would prefer a direct connection between the legislative branch and the judiciary !, 
  what 's your paypal ? 
  most eastern european migrants for example will say no to the second question then . 
  god a damn load of those unintegrated migrants here in germany , sick . 
  are you mentally ok ? 
  i never talked about a prussia reemergence . 
  i also think your definition of `` a nation 's homeland '' is retarded . 
  it 's insanely arbitrary to determine `` when and where '' a nation started existing and not at all adequate to deal with the flexible concept of a nation . 
  thank you . 
  and you realise that most of anybody 's borders are colonies then ? 
  east germany was slavic at some point . 
  the hungarians did n't live in their basin . 
  when does `` homeland '' end and `` colony '' start ? 
  if you apply that concept to all kind of conquered territory , then `` russia '' is mostly colonies . 
  is this right in your opinion ? 
  this was n't about priorities . 
  the term `` colonies '' is simply inappropriate . 
  i love you , romania , but can we please not focus on what germany is saying for once ? 
  we 're not the only one saying this . 
  and i am not necessarily even in favour of what my government says here , but this constant `` germany is trying to be a european dictator '' thing gets kinda old when it 's not just us demanding things . 
  i do n't think anybody should consider sunk costs . 
  if you wan na poison the well of german-polish friendship , that 's how you do it . 
  wo n't see a single penny . 
  the loss of its eastern territories are not germany 's fault . 
  i agree with everything except for germany `` starting ww1 '' . 
  that topics is certainly one that is up for debate . 
  everybody was fairly retarded . 
  yes !, 
  we sent our best german team from kazakhstan . 
   why should everybody have liberal values because it 's a requirement of the eu . 
  always has been . 
  i welcome any country taking its leave if it actually walks away from liberal democratic values . 
   article 116, 
  my family lived in silesia for hundreds of years . 
  i would n't exactly call it colonies . 
  it was german territory . 
  until we lost it . 
  which i 'm ok with . 
  still , calling it colonies is just wrong . 
  no , the topic is the goddamn article and its content that does very much not confirm the `` le ebin muslim invasion forced on poland '' narrative you implied . 
  instead , the numbers actually reinforce that germany 's migrants are mostly other europeans . 
  many , many poles of those . 
  again - you 'd know this , if you could read he article and actually stay on topic instead of just spouting your agenda . 
  seems to be impossible for you . 
  nope , you 're mixing things up . 
  an ** actual binding commitment ** has not existed beforehand . 
  ever since it existed , all nato countries were committed to it . 
  that goal lies in the 20s and people are aiming to adjust their budgets until then . 
  all according to the commitment - way before trump , mind you . 
  he got literally no results . 
  nobody is attempting to reach 2 % before the legally binding date . 
  everybody still doing the commitment that is actually binding . 
  absolutely nothing changed except his rhetorics and celebration of supposedly forcing nato countries to finally act according to commitments . 
  you proposed a question that was completely off-topic . 
  you are admitting to literally spouting your own agenda under an article that talks about a completely different issue . 
  it 's frankly embarrassing to look at . 
  hmm . 
  you come to an article literally about numbers , comment about a topic that the article is not at all about , implying that the article supports what you 're saying and then * you * are the one banging your head against a brick wall ? 
  good one . 
   numbers do n't matter at all nice . 
  feelz over realz . 
  lol . 
  how about you look at actual numbers and then we talk ? 
  i 'm not your nanny that gets paid to explain you how to find out whether or not this is actually about the migration you implied it to be about . 
  so , use your reading ability . 
   this is russia 's fault what is n't russia 's fault ? 
  i grew up in the former ddr and most of our social problems are a direct result of a forced 40 year dictatorship . 
  if you send me nice sweets , we can make a deal, 
  not even that . 
  if poland from commie times is the same legal entity as poland today , it does n't matter if puppet or not . 
  we did n't lose our colonies as a result of ww2 . 
  did n't read the study - nice . 
  i 'm not concerned by intra-eu migration as seen in the german stats . 
  in fact , that 's the point of free movement . 
  what the fuck does `` unintegrated '' mean and how do you determine it for statistics ? 
   deutschl\u00e4nder first off , that 's trademarked . 
  secondly , if you start this trend , i will personally do everything within my power to end austria as a nation . 
  other than that , your argument is entirely invalid . 
  it is clearly defined who is german by our constitution . 
  i do n't know about his success rate though . 
  countries were generally already committed to 2 % ** within the set timeframe ** . 
  and his healthcare was n't his healthcare to begin with . 
  plus it seems to be dead in the water . 
  there 's nothing wrong with having the party design a product/project , but this one is quite an extreme case . 
  as if . 
  common responsibilities were always attached to the benefits ee has received for over a decade now . 
  it 's intellectually dishonest to treat it as some kind of newly found poison .
