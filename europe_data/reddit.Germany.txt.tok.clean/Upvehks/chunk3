  or maybe they do in bank payments because we think that they would n't, 
  first of all , this is objectively not true and merely a hyperbole . 
  second of all , i 'm not / r/politics regardless of the validity of your claim . 
  my definition follows the official statements of the secret service . 
  right , but a refugee is less likely to commit arson than a nazi and i do n't know why you insist on unifying accidents and arson , ( because we do n't even have accident numbers of nazis to create an apt comparison ) , but i very much think that accident and arson should be separated . 
  nazis are more likely to wilfully burn down a refugee home , which is why they need to be focused on . 
  easy . 
  nice , twisting your entire point about the afd being nazis in a way so that you can say `` i never meant it like that '' . 
  the point of your comparison was literally saying that refugees are statistically more likely to cause a fire and now suddenly you supposedly never argued for that . 
  poetic . 
   sure , but why would this matter at all ? 
  see , your entire afd = nazis was about arguing that nazis are less likely per person to cause a fire . 
  however , you lied . 
  it means that the danger coming from refugees is statistically lower than the danger coming from nazis . 
  which means that one nazi is a higher risk than a refugee . 
  that was all i was saying in the first place . 
  i guess we agree on that then . 
  yeah , you attempted to defend your first on-topic comment by using skewed and completely off-topic statistics . 
  that was my point this entire time . 
  not to mention ... even if it 's about ** fires in general ** . 
  because of the number of refugees in germany , a refugee is statistically less likely to cause a fire in any way compared to the likelihood of a straight up neo-nazi to wilfully cause a fire . 
  which , btw , i also said from the very start . 
  incorrect . 
  at some point i was talking about the rate of any fire breaking out per refugee being lower than arson by legit nazis . 
  you tried to argue that that was n't true by calling all afd voters nazis . 
  then you dropped the point . 
  i stand by that point . 
  then we started arguing about what is more dangerous . 
  and i certainly do n't include actual accidents in the stats of how dangerous refugees are , because then we 'd also have to include car accidents in the stat for how dangerous neo-nazis are . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  if you wan na do an absolute comparison , intent matters a lot . 
  we do n't even have stats of unintended fires neo-nazis create in general . 
  it 's a ridiculous twisting of how statistics work . 
  if you wan na compare relative numbers per person , we can compare without including the intent of the creator of the fire . 
   fireworks that was merely an example by the page you posted , not exclusively the other part of what is not arson . 
  exclusively `` essen-schwelbrand '' is not included in these cases of a fire breaking out . 
  you 've stopped trying now , i see . 
  accidents do n't constitute harm ** by arsonists ** , which is what we were talking about . 
  arson is legally regulated in \u00a7 306 stgb and requires intent or ** it is not arson ** . 
  we were talking about arson , were we not ? 
   but it was definitely discouraged by media . 
  simply untrue . 
  give me one example of an established media outlet discouraging mourning . 
  you 're a liar , lad . 
  this category includes accidents . 
  wan na try again ? 
  accidents do n't constitute harm . 
  wilful arson does . 
  and refugees with wilful arson constitute a lower threat of likelihood than wilful arson by nazis . 
  what do you not get about statistics ? 
   afd voters are so dangerous that antifa is fighting them with violence , and the most of german media supports it . 
      that only makes sense if they 're full-blown nazis . 
  lol , sure , antifa is now supported by the german media . 
  there 's nothing to add to that other than that you are delusional . 
   events that are twice as likely to happen to me , are twice as dangerous to me . 
  you 're not the one being harmed . 
  refugees however are at a high degree of danger of being harmed . 
  and since this is a state in which the law rules supreme , they deserve safety measures , which includes being vocal and active against neo-nazism . 
  not that you 'd actually understand that though . 
  you 're terrible at statistics , course or not . 
  and you use being terrible at it to justify your personal worldview . 
  quite embarrassing . 
  also a lost cause . 
  so , i guess that was that discussion . 
  you do n't even budge about being hot garbage at statistics , because you 'd have to give up your narrative if you did . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ps : from your other comment :  if all nazi arsonists disappeared tomorrow , the risk for asylum seekers of having to evacuate their building due to fire would decrease by 30 % . 
  now put in how many fires were caused by accident and you 'll get actual harmful and dangerous numbers of refugees against refugees , which - btw - are lower than nazi arson attacks . 
   more asylum seekers than nazis ? 
   70 % of germans vote , 8 % of those are going to vote for nazi party afd . 
   that 's 4.6 million nazis . 
  did you actually just assume that 4.6 million people will vote for the afd ? 
  do you even realize how dumb that is , seeing as not all 82million people in germany can vote ? 
  only 61.8 million germans are even able to vote this year . 
  and did you really just equalize afd voters to straight up nazis ? 
  did you actually just assume that 100 % of afd voters would potentially be willing to burn down a refugee centre ? 
  you 're trying to put so many strawmen down , but i ca n't even address them simply because your numbers are so ridiculously far off . 
  btw , only the npd is legally a nazi party . 
  the afd is not . 
  what i was and am saying is that the likelihood of refugees burning down a refugee centre ** by accident or wilfully ** is lower per refugee than a straight up neo-nazi burning down one ** exclusively wilfully ** . 
  it 's just that there are a lot more refugees than straight up nazis . 
   i care about sources of harm proportionally to how likely they are to happen to me . 
  the same applies for asylum seekers , i assume . 
  you care about skewed statistics , because you never had a single statistics course in your life , but that 's about it . 
   fire at housing for asylum seekers is twice as likely to be caused by the people living inside than by nazis . 
  yeah , because there are many more asylum seekers than neo-nazis ? 
  do you actually just ignore how statistics work in your daily life ? 
       you must live on another planet . 
      all the media were wailing like it 's not the time to cry and point fingers . 
  just sit quietly and accept the new reality . 
  nice lies . 
  germany mourned for its dead sisters and brothers . 
  you 're disgusting for lying about something as basic as human empathy . 
  the fact that one side does it obviously means that the other side does n't do it , right ? 
  what are you even trying to prove other than that you like one-dimensional news records ? 
  reminder that the iranian-german in munich was also a neo-nazi who perceived himself to be aryan . 
  so , multiple accounts posting the same two links with roughly the same text is now natural opposition l m a o , not even trying anymore . 
  we ca n't even win the battle against hired commenters . 
  advantages or not , what made you think we 'd have any chance against a properly programmed bot army brigading ? 
  [ not exactly a tough case either . 
   i 've scrolled from top to bottom and i 've seen just a few comments speaking for the ban .
