   look mate if you 're not going to read the fucking thread at all to see the context of my statements there 's no fucking point responding to comments on reddit . 
  no , you misunderstood me . 
  i was asking whether or not somebody used these insults before brexit . 
  because i can assure you that they did . 
  inselaffe is something that you could hear in german pubs from time to time , brexit or not . 
  and in other countries , too . 
  this is n't some new insult to spite your democratic vote . 
   yes , they are very weak insults like calling americans yanks or the brits limeys . 
  since when do you decide for others how offensive an insult is ? 
  get the fuck out with that thinking . 
   who the fuck calls germany nazis , maybe in your mind that 's something that goes on all the time but i assure it 's not acceptable in civilised society . 
  how detached are you ?

  you 're delusional for denying this . 
  absolutely delusional . 
   mildly racist stereotype , again totally incomparable . 
   you 're just doing the terrifying thing that this generation of germans does , which is try to act like the war is no longer relevant . 
  it will never stop being relevant , even when your children 's children 's children are walking the earth . 
  it is literally the fire out of which our modern society was born . 
   it 's a very valid point that the eu was built to stop nationalism and national hatred . 
  those people bashing the uk for leaving as if it were a personal slight are completely going against the spirit of the whole damn project . 
  you 're saying that prejudice does n't exist in europe unless you go against the eu . 
  that is way more dangerous , because you 're not even acknowledging the harsh reality of prejudice in europe . 
  you re-affirmed my original point . 
  you 're just as dangerous to a peaceful europe as those euronationalists are . 
  you disregard anything that goes against other nations and only care if it goes against your own . 
   nobody was serious using phrases like perfidious albion or island monkey back then , these are n't funny phrases that were used jokingly like frog , they are literally war insults , which should go to show you how deep the irrational hate some eu ideologues have for the whole of the uk right now . 
  so nobody said `` perfidious albion '' or `` island monkey '' ? 
  and frog or frogeater are only ever meant in jest ? 
  or calling germany nazis ? 
  or calling southern europeans lazy bums ? 
  there 's no point in arguing with you if you are this detached from reality . 
   `` three generations of proud european nationalism '' where did they tell you that ? 
   maybe , you 'd like to be `` rich '' , but imo if you think that you just want to downplay the significance of the war which is even more concerning are you fucking kidding me ? 
  so me saying that oversimplifying the world is bad is now downplaying the horrors of the second world war ? 
  the way you are equalizing the horrors of said war with what you perceive of supposed harrassment by very few people is disgusting . 
  that is what is actually downplaying the horrors , which is why i tried to argue that you should n't do it . 
  jesus , what a delusional argument that is . 
   back to anglo bashing and whip out old slurs like `` perfidious albion '' and `` island monkeys '' . 
  where were you when this was done before brexit ? 
  where were you when the french were constantly being called frogs ? 
  southern europeans lazy ? 
  germans depicted as nazis everywhere in southern europe ? 
  where were you then ? 
  you seem to have completely shut out the fact that these little squabbles were going on this entire fucking time . 
  did that makes you as concerned ? 
  besides some ridiculous hardliners , you 'll find nobody that is against the uk in that way . 
  at the most , it 's people that are ridiculing the non-existent negotiation plans of the uk and that has nothing to do with nationalism and everything with the uk having little coordination in these negotiations . 
  comparing eu nationalism ( and , again , that is not actually something that exists unless you never leave the information bubble that is / r/europe ) to national socialism - that 's fucking rich . 
  it is - which is something you accused another user of - childish as well . 
  if you ca n't see that you 're on the other side of the coin you rightfully tried to call out , then i do n't know what to tell you . 
  both sides are shit , but both sides are only hardliners . 
  sadly you seem to be on one of those sides . 
  let me explain it in details then . 
   i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  so i should insult him , too ! '', 
  that 's what he 's doing and that 's an eye-for-an-eye territory , which is pretty sad . 
   where ? 
  * the last time there were calls for people to be `` proud europeans '' in europe it did n't go so well if you remember . 
  in fact , the eu was founded to stop this kind of bullshit . 
  * this is what he posted . 
  now , another poster was curious : * to be honest i do n't . 
  when did that happen ? 
  * his response : * 1939 ... * if that is n't a childish oversimplification of comparing `` euronationalism '' ( whatever that may be ) to nazism , i dunno what is . 
  it 's the same ridiculous slander as `` perfidious albion '' is . 
  we 're in eye-for-an-eye territory now ? 
  / u/kingofeggsandwiches explicitly called for the hysteria over brexit to end ( i 'm a fan of that btw ) and then he starts another hysteria right away !, 
  that 's not how you stop a hysteria . 
  it 's two sides of the same coin what he 's doing . 
  man , i get that you want the brexit hysteria to stop , but you 're really going insane with this ridiculous and far-fetched comparisons ... 
  getting a divorce - brexit . 
  shooting your own dick off - having no negotiation strategy whatsoever . 
  that 's what these metaphors actually mean here . 
  agreed , but we * do * have constitutional monarchies in europe, 
  sure , sure !, 
  i completely agree !, 
  i thank this historic development whenever i am reminded of how much good the code civil did . 
  i mostly meant to put the general potential explanation out there . 
  while what happened let to everything we have today , one could 've probably done it a bit different ( evidently not though ), 
  yeah , to which i simply added that i downvoted you because your entire way of thought on this comment chain was off-topic . 
  that was what i was saying . 
  why ? 
  because your entire way of thought on this comment chain was off-topic . 
  you were the only one that interpreted everything this way . 
  how more off-topic can you get without starting to talk about non-politics topics ? 
  that 's not great , all things considered . 
  this june was too much . 
  i have been so happy with these days of rain lately ... the future is n't looking that bright . 
  we really can achieve whatever we want , it just wo n't matter if this does n't get addressed . 
  [ you literally said yourself in a different spinoff of the original comment chain that you misunderstood was this entire comment chain was about . 
  ] ( https://puu.sh/whxbt/4cd9610865.png ) what 's there to explain ? 
  the one you linked to is a part of a comment chain that discusses a topic as a whole . 
  you were the only one that completely misunderstood what the reference was pointing towards . 
  do you not get that ? 
  is that really that hard ? 
  man , i do n't know what to tell you . 
  you even admitted elsewhere that you were off-topic . 
   no it does n't on mobile ok ? 
  it links there on pc . 
  what 's the point in arguing with somebody that does n't even admit that he was completely off the topic approached in the entirety of the comment chain and that literally everybody else was referring to ?
