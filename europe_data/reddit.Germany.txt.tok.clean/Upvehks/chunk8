  see you around . 
  i have more context to that post in my link , which was the point of me linking it . 
  it actually ** shows ** the rest of the comment chain . 
  click on my link and you 'll see two posts more that ** are the start of the comment chain ** . 
  i 'm not in favour myself , but if the french wanted it - what could you do ? 
  doubt that they want it though . 
  that 's what i thought , yeah . 
  they cash in almost all sides with this one, 
  the chain actually started with [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mt524/israel_backs_hungary_says_financier_soros_is_a/dk44ie9/?context=10000 ) . 
  so , yeah , you completely missed the focus of the comment chain . 
  i 'm pretty sure that , in an historical introspection , the terror that came afterwards and led to a new empire , which led to a new kingdom afterwards etc etc ... beheading the king may have prevented a quicker path into an orderly democratic organisation . 
  do n't they just try to trigger everybody ? 
  i 'm downvoting your comments , because they literally added nothing to the discussion . 
  you were completely off-topic . 
  so you 're the only one in this entire thread to take it like that . 
  got it . 
  you did n't , but your first response responds to a comment chain about him financing marxist organisations . 
  `` i did n't say that !!!!!!!! '', 
  is a pretty weak defense since this is what this entire comment chain is about . 
  look , that 's fair enough , but it does n't prove his supposed connections to these circles either and i 'm unwilling to accept slander of his name just because he 's a nice scapegoat for some people . 
  so either bring proof or you got absolutely nothing other than `` you got no proof he 's not doing it !, 
  i 'm not ok with germany being as hot and humid as spain . 
  i 'm not at all ok with this . 
  please stop . 
  he is a loud critical voice about israel 's settlement projects that are being conducted despite being illegal under international law that israel recognises . 
  that 's why israel does n't like him . 
  so what you 're saying is that you got no proof whatsoever and want us to connect the dots without any indication to find evidence for the necessity of connecting the dots ? 
  sure , strictly conservative europeans start voting labour once they have citizenship . 
  whatever you say , my man . 
  first generation can vote if they just get citizenship btw . 
  you think the polish people entering the country were natural labour voters ? 
  after the 2004 expansion , eu countries literally had migratory opt-outs for those eastern countries added to the eu . 
  germany used it . 
  the uk did n't . 
  really creates some questions , does n't it . 
  which is why nobody 's attempting to get you to stay . 
  just as god would have wanted it !, 
  thank you , gschizas . 
  so , i can keep my bavarian flag , right ? 
  yeah , that was the point when tolstoy wrote it, 
  the notion that other nations were irrelevant says more about tolstoy than anybody else . 
  have you read his books ? 
  germans are only relevant to him , because he absolutely hates them . 
  it 's hilarious !, 
  more like national symbol of france , famalam, 
  sure , every downvote you get must be from the people responding to you . 
  thanks for confirming that !, 
  classic gabriel for condemning violent rioters ? 
  i welcome this form of siggi then . 
  oh , they were not the ones that spread these rumours , but how nice of you to assume it !, 
  in fact , they got accepted * because * of the rumours . 
  are you saying that they played the longcon just to get refuge ? 
  nothing ever happens in peaceful chechnya . 
  tell me , are you satisfied with a government investigation in * chechnya * that is literally ruled by a muslim extremist warlord ? 
  because i 'm not and if people start claiming that everybody has been cleared of any wrongdoings , i wo n't trust those people saying it . 
  oh , what will they gain ? 
  getting rid of kadyrov ? 
  doubt it . 
  international sanctions ? 
  as if . 
  we barely did the sanction game for russia taking foreign land and then supplying a civil war in the ukraine . 
  painting putin in a bad light ? 
  how much darker can he be painted ? 
  as if that has an influence on anybody . 
  must 've been those two gay chechen refugees that lithuania accepted that spread the rumours to get access to lithuania , i guess !, 
  not being sceptical about '' '' '' `` investigations '' '' '' '' is kinda ridiculous , considering what happened in chechnya and what was done about it ( or rather : not done about it ) . 
   that does n't make much sense . 
  allegedly . 
  on a more serious note , an investigation regarding the events of the last months in chechnya would be the least effort that should occur , but never will . 
   allegedly . 
  allegedly . 
  and i 'm supposed to believe kadyrov now ? 
  sorry lad , but these people were murdered without any court judgement and i 'm not going to believe a murderous warlord to suddenly tell me the truth . 
  so you have no proof of him actually stirring shit other than a journalist taking a photo and publishing it ? 
  tja . 
  it has to be there , because extremists have no right to determine where the country hosts congresses and such . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  i disagree with this . 
  we can not accept that violent groups determine where we can and where we can not host whatever congress we are hosting . 
  nun . 
  tja . 
  they were n't really on-board with being handed over to stalin by churchill , no . 
  read the entire poland section if you 're interested . 
  i 've got pretty solid ground to stand on in this argument . 
  poland is not known as some wobbly floating piece of land . 
  and please note that that does n't make poland any happier that the germans ca n't say `` we were nice to them . '', 
  whataboutisms did n't help them in ww2 . 
  the uk could have . 
  worrying about trump means worrying about what he does means worrying about him going to poland . 
  it would be outside of the norm to not worry about that meeting . 
  is that so hard to understand ? 
  your first post was questioning why one should worry in the first place . 
  i tell you that there is reason to worry about the moves of the us and suddenly you 're talking about why poland should n't cut ties with the us ** when nobody ever was arguing for that . 
  ** this is you being defensive . 
  the victim role . 
  no arguing will bring fruit with you , because you just immediately assumed that poland was being policed/supervised or else you would n't have asked why people are concerned in the first place when you 're supposedly concerned yourself . 
  what 's the point if you do n't actually care about arguing ? 
  have a good one, 
  yes , every move of the us president concerns me . 
  that 's the point .
