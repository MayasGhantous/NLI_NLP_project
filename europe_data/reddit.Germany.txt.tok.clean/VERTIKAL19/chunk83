  germany leaving might make some waves but that is insanely unlikely . 
  uhm you do n't pay that to the government but rather to the company doing the teaching,

  and i would gues the biggest common denominator you would find is the soviet union, 
  that 's just not true . 
  terrorism in europe was more prevalenet in the 70s and 80s in europe, 
  so yeah there was a huge rthnic cleansing in ee removing some 14 million germans with somewhere between 500k and 2 million dead . 
  in addition to that germany got split up and lost large parts of its territory . 
  well it was pretty good under bismarck after him not so much . 
  wilhelm ii wasnt a great kaiser, 
  yes i think efficiency is something we should strive for but not by abandoning basic human rights, 
  not necessarily . 
  the most effiecient way for example to solve the refugee crisis would be closing the borders and having soldiers shoot anybody and orderly kill every refugee we have here so far . 
  no refugees no problem . 
  that is a fairly efficient solution but i dont think i have to explain why we shouldnt do that, 
  not necessarily .

  i also never said autocracy is good and that we should do it but that it is efficient, 
  oh it does n't have to be good for the people ruled at all , but it can be . 
  think of the dictators in ancient rome where they appointed them for 6 months in times of crisis . 
  there is also a reason why the military is not a democracy , but rather a chain of command,

  but is n't autocracy in general a very effective system of government ? 
  an effective government does n't mean a righteous or good government , but it eliminates a lot of the things that take time . 
  a law that is decided upon by the f\u00fchrer takes a lot less time than if you have to make a law through a democratic process . 
  but thats mallorca already : /, 
  they are held on principle grounds , but they would be loosened by now i think if not for ee, 
  so what are your alternatives ? 
  a military intervention in eastern ukraine ? 
  that would have been utter madness . 
  i should have made a cout how often people say germany is responsible for the refugee crisis ... 
  well it is an oppinion piece after all, 
  so many homosex ? 
  we will see a new chapter of the greek crisis and possibly greece leaving the euro zone . 
  but those people are not working in retail . 
  if you look at what these people are doing it is logistics work . 
  i mean the whole point of a business like amazons is that you do n't need retail workers, 
  well amazon has not duty to be unpolitical . 
  they can express an oppinion through something like that and it gives some pr points, 
  you knowmthat poland still has a lower gdp than just northrhine westphalia ? 
  yep donating to charity is clearly censorship ... 
   at the moment greece is in the euro , and piled high with crippling austerity , and being forced to introduce laws at the point of a gun greece was free to leave the euro at any point . 
  sure the legal framework might not have been in place , but i am sure our politicians could have worked something out . 
  also at gunpoint seems like a bad analogy if you were the one taking aim . 
   rather than going with varoufakis ' idea of debt relief and stimulus within the eurozone , or schauble 's idea of debt relief and devaluation outside of the eurozone , you have a fudge that combines the worst of both . 
  yes you got a deal somewhere in between . 
  i think sch\u00e4uble 's ideas could have worked out , but it was the firm policy of the greek government to stay in the eurozone and the policy of the other countries to not give a nominal debt cut . 
   it would be better for everyone to either just throw money at the greeks and accept being part of a currency union means you have to subsidise the weaker members , or kick the greeks out full stop with generous support to ensure that they are not destroyed . 
  i agree , i think having greece leave the union would have been healthier , we will probably have the discussion in the coming years again anyways . 
   the point is that greece is insolvent and will not be able to pay back the loans it received , arguably ones it should never have gotten in the first place . 
  any proper resolution to the problem will have to concede that . 
  that is currently the most likely outcome . 
  there still might be a path tho for greece to recover but i think that window is closing rapidly or has already closed . 
   i think the issue is that in either case merkel would have to admit she wasted shitloads of german taxpayer 's money on backdoor bailouts for bankers and `` extend-and-pretend '' loans to artificially prevent greece from simply defaulting earlier . 
  a ton of german money will probably have gone to waste in an attempt to bail out the greek state . 
  if it was wrong to attempt to save the greek state again and again is a different question . 
  i think the first bailouts were necessary anyways tho just to stabilize the banking crisis and the eurozone to not cause another big economic crisis across the eu . 
  you have to at least contain it to greece . 
  is it optimal that there are banks too big to fail ? 
  but it is the way reality shapes up and we have to make policies for reality for the most part and not a world how we want it to be . 
  if not for the position of merkel there could have very well been a grexit, 
  yes , but it does , democracy is not the fastest or most efficient way to govern a country . 
  the issue is that if you go for more efficient , faster structures you basically need less people holding the power which means more room for power abuse . 
  if you are looking for a more efficient form of government look at china for example ... 
  could you then explain the part where they are passing through so many safe countries to me ? 
  also we can tie their benefits to staying in the country they are distributed to and send them back if they leave, 
  and it does n't even make sense . 
  merkel could have gone way farther on greece and there was quite a demand for not signing a third bailout both from within germany and from other states . 
  germany always held a postition of negotiation . 
  people are going through turkey , where syrians ca n't get asylum in turkey they just get temporary protection . 
  also in the camps are only around 30 % of the refugees . 
  after that they are in the eu where the situations in greece and hungary as entry states were desolate where the asylum system is completely overburdened so they move on . 
  i can see if you are mad at greece or hungary for not registering and providing asylum to people or turkey for not granting asylum to syrians but where do you suggest they stop when they can only get to a humane treatment in austria , germany or sweden ? 
  my personal oppinion is that every state in the eu should provide decent conditions for refugees and that they should be distributed among the different countries . 
  well it somewhat worked with eastern europe ... 
  i think there is nothing wrong with being worried . 
  i am worried too , but i think that we still have to help people fleeing from war, 
  but keep in mind that being worried about immigration does not mean that htose people are against taking in refugees . 
  see for example in my family most people are worried about the issues but still say that we have to help those people, 
  if the german government was not worried about playing nice with the smaller states in the union they could have taken a significantly tougher stance on greece in the financial crisis and again push harder against hungary in the refugee crisis . 
  and for russia germany is still part of the eu sanctions ... 
  what kinda suprised me that germans are among the least worried about terrorism while our country is probably among the most likely targets, 
  i feel like we just have very much different oppinons and vastly diverging views of the refugee crisis in general, 
  that 's just the way things work in the european institutions that smaller countries get more weight per population than big countries . 
  for example in the european parliamenet lithuania has 11 seats and germany has 96 , but germany has more than 27 timess the population of lithuania, 
  but syrians ca n't even get refugee status in turkey ... maybe there are 800 thousand living in those camps in turkey but that still leaves 1.5 million roaming turkey with no real rights . 
  no right to work or to get proper education . 
  turkey did n't sign the 1967 convention . 
  if my house was destroyed and my possesions were lost i would first drive to austria if that was sensible and if that would n't make sense i would try anything to get to the united states and in all those states i could get legal asylum . 
  i could even flee to turkey and get legal asylum there because i am a european ... also yes those gulf countries do n't concern themselves iwth it but that doesnt make it right to do . 
  yes but just blaming countries wo n't help us solve the problems . 
  we ca n't solve it if there are countries actively working against a solution . 
  that 's just how democracy often works . 
  but you ca n't enforce that rule . 
  do you think ti would have been a better idea to force a humanitarian crisis in greece or hungary by always sending everyone back ? 
  indeed but not one nearly the size of 17 billion . 
  granted that these are already calculated in . 
  i think they will figure the budget out and then we will see,
