  so there is also the question of how much you subsidize it with other taxes without realizing it , when it 's maybe a bit more visible when government money goes to corporations . 
  in addition if you would tax it like germany or denmark you would jump to # 5 . 
  i would go even further and say there are going to be some new legislations regarding google glasses . 
   backwards when it comes to the internet . 
  because germans care about privacy . 
  there are also a lot of regulations that favor consumers . 
  and gema is n't really a internet thing , it 's just that now with the internet it affects the average guy a lot more . 
  many people think it 's a bubble right now . 
  and it 's not stable at all , so it 's pretty impossible for business to have fix prices in bitcoins, 
  looks like money laundering has some side effects . 
  because for many people at the bottom it is n't flourishing . 
  the [ agenda 2010 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) which he refers to with the schr\u00f6der era brought a serious amounts of cuts to german social systems , so even with social systems many people are below the poverty line . 
  also many people working are n't making enough to make a living ( germany has no minimum wage , although there are strong unions ) , labor leasing is booming and as in many other countries also german unemployment looks nicer than they actually are . 
  compared to other countries germany is certainly doing pretty well , but it 's not like everybody is happy . 
  it just happened more gradually and on different ways . 
  to be honest i do n't really see a big advantage of stores being open that long . 
  i have often been at stores just around 8pm and there was n't much going on . 
  and i think it 's nice for people working there not having to work that late and other people working night shifts still have from 12hours from 8am to 8pm to go shopping . 
  and now look at all the tables below and how it looked 5-10 years ago ... 
   especially since they 're not very successfully at it ? 
  maby webdesigners will probably disagree with you . 
  it 's a real pain in the ass when you ca n't use new css or html5 stuff , because ie wo n't be able to deal with it and is still installed on many company pcs . 
   it seems to me like an equivalent would be buying a car and then being mad that the manufacturer put their tires on it . 
  no it 's like the only choice of cars in europe would be let 's say vws and then some american trucks ( maybe representing ios ) imports and some other cars which require some knowledge about car maintainance ( representing linux ) . 
  and ** now ** if the car manufacturer vw always just sells his cars which tires that are n't up to todays standards there might be complaints , too . 
  thanks . 
  i googled , but i only found articles suggesting such laws . 
  any source ? 
  the government still grants gema certain rights and without those they would not have that power . 
  yeah well that was the idea of that law in the first place : to target snippets . 
  but snippets are pretty much defined as `` small text passages '' '', 
   the text that was passed in the bundestag exempts individual words or `` single words or small text passages '' although it does not state how short a passage has to be to be royalty-free . 
  i 'm just at a loss of words here . 
  it 's really like the politicians realized how fucked up this idea is and how much resistance there was on the internet , but still wanted to push it through to please the publishers . 
  have to come to germany if you want to achive something . 
  because they think it is supposed to increases the quality of the posts . 
  so you might be less likely to go to business fanpage and write something stupid or insult them . 
  and they especially care about it when it comes to blogs and other websites integrating the facebook comment system . 
  but not all ( = most ) customers do n't have the money to pay for such cars . 
  the problem for those car manufacturers is simply that there is a lot more competition and alternatives in that segment . 
  according to the german wikipedia it at least means the european comission has to deal with the topic . 
  i think what makes whitehouse petitions useless is the low treshhold . 
  i mean they now need at least need 100k signatures , but that 's still a lot less compared to these 1 million and does n't reflect the population difference , even in germany we have 50k and have far less then half the population of the us . 
  it 's not about the karma , i woul n't care either . 
  but it 's kinda stupid when the only comment that sparked a discussion with pro and contra arguments ends up with a * comment score below threshold *, 
  and she stepped back once it was confirmed ... 
  always funny to see how the all politicians who are n't fluent in english are the ones who want to fix our education system, 
  [ you better believe bavaria is fucking serious about this !, 
  usually you can figure out who that is if you know that person if not then you do n't accept it and if it 's your friend he should be able to tell you who he is . 
   in europe , you forgot to add ... ? 
  europe actually to a huge extent seem to have much better service coverage . 
  honestly most us states would kill for the coverage tesla has in germany . 
   most of the car companies have outsourced most of their car parts . 
  the only thing that differentiates the car companies is their ice ( internal combustion engine ) . 
  just because they are outsourced does n't mean that the parts and cars are n't still designed by those companies . 
  maybe magna steyr builds a car for bmw , but in the end it 's still designed by bmw engineers and uses bmws supply chain . 
  the only difference is it 's done in a different factory . 
   you do n't ditch hundreds of billions of euros of business into ices overnight , especially when you have entire engineering teams built around these legacy , 100 + year technologies . 
  engine development is just one part . 
  you still have the body , the suspension , the interior , the electronics etc. 
  sure those things are supplied , but someone still has to put them together in a great car . 
  just look how tesla is struggling with some simple 2nd row seats on the model x. . .  think of how tesla continually updates its vehicle . 
  just recently they added piloted automated driving . 
  they still have not added it . 
  people who brought the car one year ago and spend $ 100k have not had the functionality . 
  if the had brought a mercedes s-class back then they would have had active lane keeping assist from day 1 . 
  sorry , but i rather buy a car that has the functions i want when it comes out of the factory than one where they promise features , but i never know what i will get . 
   digital-first mentality you mean the `` we do n't have everything ready for the release so we will just offer it later with upgrades and call it a feature '' ? 
   if they abandon their old models , they will bankrupt their companies no it wo n't because in the end you will always need new hardware . 
   the model x is sold out all the way to h2 2016 already and the model s has delivery times later this year . 
  and that 's with their whole initiative offerings and the factory even shutting down a few times to get ready for the model x. 
   ( vs. sourcing them from more expensive competition ) it 's called suppliers . 
  the automotive industry has been using them for decades . 
  in this case most manufacturers seem to bet on lg chem , which means lg will probably also scale up production over the next years and reduce the price with the increased volume . 
  yeah , but that wo n't cover if you do commercial driving which uber is . 
   how would that stop the taxi lobby to try and get special laws to shut them down ? 
  again what exactly are you talking about . 
  in germany the main complaints were lack of commercial insurance and no passenger transportation license ( which is required for a lot more than taxis and neither very restrictive nor expensive to get ), 
  sure , but if their service is so superior they could for now also just charge the same make a higher profit and have happy drivers . 
   germany i really would like to know what bad regulations there are in the germany taxi industry , especially what uber could not just easily comply with . 
   ** just because you have a license system out of control ** does n't mean a regulated taxi service is obsolete . 
  it 's like saying oh we have to amputate a leg , well let 's better just let that person die . 
   in any case nowhere does this justify paying insane license fees . 
  never claimed that . 
  actually i said the exact opposite . 
  you think uber drivers tell their insurance they drive for uber ? 
  so you do n't think the average person should be require to have insurance ? 
  that really helps me when i get hit by one and insurance companies start fighting who is going to pay . 
  commercial insurance ? 
  health checkups ? 
  more frequent inspections ? 
  additional safety features in the cars ? 
  regulations when it comes to coverage , pricing , providing transport for handicapped people etc. 
  so you do n't think stuff like commercial insurance is important ? 
  just because you have a license system out of control does n't mean a regulated taxi service is obsolete . 
  it 's like saying oh we have to amputate a leg , well let 's better just let that person die . 
   but sweden should be worse poland . 
   well , i did see and read such reports ( i speak german ) . 
  here 's a collection with hungarian subtitles : i do n't undersatnd your problem with the report . 
  they pretty much said that refugees refuse to register and just want to come to germany .
