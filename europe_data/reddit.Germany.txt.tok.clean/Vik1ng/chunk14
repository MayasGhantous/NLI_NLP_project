  i bet a lot of german companies hire driver trough poland etc. 
  requiring the same wage would probably create a lot of jobs in germany . 
  are you taling about the tv stations ? 
  if they just want to be in one country then there is still the other side which makes the content and wants to sell it . 
  they will have to figure out a way to price it so it stays affordable . 
  but they also ca n't afford to just ignore the european market . 
  not but that 's also simply not realistic . 
  most things are not just directly payed for by the people who use it . 
  and who gets the money ? 
  how many people actually use dutch roads without doing some kind of business in the netherlands ? 
  the question is will they stop driving there because they have to pay a few europe for the road ? 
  also how many actually drive into the country and just not trough the country ? 
  if you look at a map of europe and germany position , i bet that happens pretty often . 
  you could even get trough without buying fuel once . 
  well , we already made those pay . 
  yu want into relevanz ? 
  tesla nation if it was up to reddit . 
  even there people are not happy , because it hurts their wallet . 
  all that solar and shutting down nuclear while on the one hand has support on the other hand people to feel that great about once they look at their electricity bill . 
  and they know that stricter regulations for cars etc. 
  will just make their next car more expensive . 
   some of which were recorded in the us going 20-40 times over the legal limit ** in the us fucking a ** for nitrogen oxide , a gas that can give you emphysema and bronchitis and heart problems and causes acid rain . 
  we do n't have such strict laws in germany and diesel cars are very common . 
  overall i also do n't think most people really care that much . 
  * occupation ? 
  that 's how people see him in his current job , not as chancellor . 
  he also also did n't do that great in 2009 . 
  should still be some internet place or whatever to look up some stuff . 
  also does not seem like those are exactly the poorest people who can afford such trips . 
  this one ? 
  i live in germany , and i am surprised at the `` 54 % approval rating '' , not met a single person that has anything nice to say about her . 
  probably because there are no alternatives . 
  like many probably think `` mh how else would i want '' and then you realize that the spd just had shit candidates for years ... 
  do n't they have internet there ? 
  [ simple solution ] ( http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/01240/tom-cruise_topgun__1240566a.jpg ), 
   which is usually crimes which give over 1 year sentence and the offender is at risk at repeating his crimes while free . 
  how does this not apply here ? 
   you have to draw the line somewhere otherwise you would have to invite every party candidating . 
  you could look a polling . 
  results last election . 
  look at the federal level etc. 
  there is a difference between a party polling at 5 % and one at 0.5 %, 
  you do n't care if someone made sure the food in a restaurants is up to current health standards ? 
  yeah , because in your home country the living cost and gas prices are the same ... 
  your are welcome !, 
  how are you doing ? 
  it 's really becoming a thing , especially in the us . 
  sure it 's a niche market and not mainstream , but it 's growing ( lol ), 
  [ nope . _ . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pm861/germany_may_use_military_planes_to_speed_up/cw7lonm ), 
   was amazed to see that when there is a break in the action , the players are literally just standing around talking germany national tv had the superbowl rights a few years ago . 
  they ca n't show commercials that late , so they just showed a stadium camera or the reporter chatting with some german player they invited and even behind them in the booth at the stadium you could see the players on the field just standing around at the side . 
  it 's hilarious when american try to defend it with switching from offend to defense or something like that . 
  nope . 
  everyone just standing around and chilling . 
  engineering class in the uk ? 
  and their families live in germany ? 
   therefore the market values them too which leads students to compete for those and universities getting better quality students . 
  i do n't know anyone in germany who wants to go to the uk to study engineering . 
  yeah , because tesla has stuff like head up displays , laser light or you know carbon fibre bodies ... 
   the others are n't at that point yet afaik . 
  and the other will use their ** supply chain ** to get batteries . 
  lg chem is already building a new factory in china . 
  the tesla model s is n't the best selling ev . 
  vw sold more than twice as many e-golfs . 
  he probably meant http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1r51piwyv1r5lyu3.jpg vs. http://www.pc-magazin.de/bilder/74029447/300x180-c2/image.jpg, 
  should have some american tomahawks . 
  probably will notice if everyone around you starts moving around . 
  they do n't pay attention , because the conductor speaks in the same monotone voice and i do n't care if i take the train every day . 
  but i bet i would notice if some scared driver would scream something about a collision . 
  `` if you want to govern '' yeah which they do n't want in their first year ... 
  additional ? 
  people who work already have that money these days , people who receive pensions and are on wellfare receive a bit less than that and that amount could also be the one they aim for an not for 1000 . 
   it would just create a huge inflation . 
  why ? 
  but the other parties actually have a real solution ? 
  at least the pirates called out the government for their unconstitutional handling regarding the esm . 
  it 's not really welfare when you have a job . 
  if you manage to get citizenship , 
  yeah they really want to fuck artists by reducing it to ** death +10 years ** ... 
  for me he does n't look like they had more to offer back then . 
  the world was just a lot simpler and environment , anti-war and supporting women was already enought . 
  especially when you look at wahlaufruf 1983 http://www.boell.de/stiftung/archiv/archiv-4289.html, 
  looking back at the stasi i actually think privacy and data protection are very important things that should not be easily given up in the war on terrorism or even worse just to fine some filesharers . 
  you realize that you ca n't just write down such a program ? 
  and that 2 years ago they had a few dozen active members and that was basically it ? 
  how are they supposed to write down a manifesto for a country like germany ? 
  it was first one year ago with the berlin election that they actually became relevant . 
  a basic income guarantee is basically the best thing out there any party in germany can offer when it comes to a roof over you head and food on the table . 
  apart from that they made decisions on exactly that economic program this weekend and not about internet regulations . 
  with nothing of value you mean the only party that cares about civil rights , has a basic understanding of the internet and challenges copyright and something like the gema and has realized that the `` war on drugs '' has failed in germany , too ? 
  also what apart from the polls has imploded ? 
  and yes some leadership problems but that is nothing that ca n't be fixed . 
  polls are pretty useless when there is no election coming up . 
  usually it 's just depending which party is viewed in a positive or negative way at that time . 
  or in the case of the pirate party is was mostly about attention on a federal level . 
  there were state elections every few months and there was also a growing interest regarding their position so they got invited into political talkshows etc. 
  right now the party is still growing and i think they are happy about the decline in attention , because that allows them to do their work , the polls will change once their is election time and everything above 5 % is a victory for them . 
   only 50 % of germans woud be willing for germany to stay in the eu , tendency sinking . 
  and only 32 % want to leave it ... also eu = / eurozone,
