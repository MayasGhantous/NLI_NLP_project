   that the euro was the price germany paid for reunification [ do you notice something ? 
  also that 's not how the eu works . 
  no members takes place in all the different areas , most of them focus on certain topics . 
   a member of a gun club recently went on a killing spree not unlike the one in aurora . 
  because you can still take the gun home if you are in a sports club , which for me does n't make sense . 
  you should just have to keep your gun at the shooting range and that problem would be solves . 
  i do n't have a problem with supporting other states either , but it has to be done in a fair way . 
  another example is how students in berlin pay no tuition and students in bavaria do , that just makes no sense . 
  also when i visited berlin last time some of their infrastructure was superior to bavaria 's . 
  i was also in potsdam on my way there and really got a shock when i saw the inner city . 
  i mean everything looked perfect and was nicely done and when i look at my city in bavaria there are always things that need to be done and there is no money for it . 
  see table below . 
  inflationsbereinigt = inflation-adjusted, 
  did you look at the numbers ? 
  the amount they got in the first years is a joke compared to the money they payed into the system in recent years . 
  overall they are ** - ** 20billion into the system right now . 
  was about time . 
  it 's really ridiculous when you [ look at the numbers ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a4nderfinanzausgleich#finanzvolumen ) ... especially from bavaria ( by ) and berlin ( be ), 
  i guess he is speaking about germany , because the uk got it a long time ago , we just recently . 
  german banks ? 
  what has the hell have they to do with that ?? 
  a few cinemas might have this for a few movies , but it 's not really a big thing . 
  and apart from that they basically dub everything on tv , with no option to changed the language . 
  just sky as pay-tv offers you that option . 
   but more importantly i think is that a lot of the media we get is in english ... 
  in scandinavia we never dub anything and just use subtitles i wish that was true in germany :(, 
   you do n't really believe the pirates are `` the average man 's party '' , do you ? 
  no at the moment not especially not for the older more conservative people . 
  but i thinks they have many issues in their program , where they could become a new average party in the future . 
  and not just because of their stance on the internet , but also separation of government and church , equal rights for gay people , education politics etc. 
   you ca n't just get voted in , go through an ausbildung and do politics . 
  but let us just watch and see  i think you can especially as long as you are in the oppositions and in the end your vote as member of parliament does n't really matter . 
  french banks are in deep shit if greece would go down . 
  there is much more at stake for them down there than it is for germany . 
  http://www.efsf.europa.eu/attachments/faq_en.pdf ( 2nd page ) and [ france also got much more to loose ] ( http://www.golemxiv.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/greece-exp1.jpg ), 
  are n't topics like government transparency and more participation also a topic in local elections ? 
   because they are like truck drivers that suddenly decided to become poets no . 
  truck driving has nothing to do with poetry . 
  but on the other hand a truck driving is a average job which gives you insight in the needs of average people , which can be very useful , because that 's exactly what government or being a politician is about , making decisions that will affect average people . 
   misinformed about anything no if at all they are not informed about certain issues . 
  but then they have to do their homework just like every other politician and educate themselves about the topic . 
  if you watch their youtube videos from the berlin parliament you will notice that that 's exactly what happened there and they contribute their part to every topic that comes up . 
   and they are refusing to cooperate with other parties no they are not ... just shows how misinformed ** you ** are . 
  actually it is a lot easier to be successful in small elections . 
  the question is if a far left party can achieve the same as the pirate party . 
  it does n't help you when a party supports your goal , when a huge amount the the population is not willing to vote for that party because of different reason . 
  i would for example never vote for the left party in germany , even if they would have the same demands regarding copyright as the pirate party . 
  the problem is the party will never have success in the political system that way and wo n't get any influence in the lawmaking process . 
  if pirate bay is your only goal you do n't need to form a party . 
  how are they protected better these days ? 
  and you still have reprensetatives that can make their own decicion . 
   the party 's berlin chief compared its rise to that of the nazis such a bullshit simplification ... that 's so poorly translated and totally taken out of context here !, 
  what he did was comparing the ** growth ** of the pirate party with the nsdap ( nazi party ) , of course the comparison itself and saying `` rapid rise '' was n't the best idea , but the right-wing extremism the media interpretes into that statement just is n't there !, 
  and in fact the pirate party was the fastest growing party in germany since the nsdap , even the greens could n't match that . 
  just compare the tea party and occupy wall street and what had more influence . 
  the one thing politicians care most about are votes . 
  that 's everything that counts in the end and that 's why becoming involved in politics is much more effective , because it forces the other parties to take up certain issues . 
  service ? 
  steam ? 
  why should i bother going trough the trouble of file sharing , when i can just buy a good game on steam and never worry again ? 
  i get automatic updates and if my harddrive crashes i just have to install steam on the new one and get everything back . 
  i know , but i never had the feeling that this had an influence in their local election campaign , whereas i really expect this to become a `` we '' as a european party in the future . 
  there was a [ pirate party international meeting ] ( http://www.pp-international.net/node/518 ) this weekend and one of the big topics was the 2014 eu election . 
  and that 's something i expect to happen in the future that similar parties in different countries will work together a lot more in upcoming elections and agree on some kind of basic eu election manifesto . 
  i think even the green parties did something similar in the last election cycle . 
  i 'm not blaming you , you just copied it . 
  it 's the first stanza of the one being used today , but without the first stanza . 
   germany , germany above everything , above everything in the world , when , for protection and defence , it always takes a brotherly stand together . 
  from the meuse to the memel , from the adige to the belt , | : germany , germany above everything , above everything in the world !, 
   insulting other politicians for trying to save schlecker jobs i do n't even blame them for that when other politicians suddenly pull of such show to save those jobs ... 
  the problem is that the constitutional court said what the trojan was allowed to do and it could do much more than that . 
   again , if you think that the phone wiretapping laws are ok , the same principles should be ok for the internet as well . 
  as i said they want to change those law , too so that 's one problem . 
  and in addition when it comes to internet surveillance there often are not warrants , because that 's the whole point of it to find suspects . 
   i do n't care what data they get as long as no one is allowed to read it without a warrant . 
  do you really think when the german government checked about 40million mails and found 200 that were somehow relavant they had a warrant for every email account ? 
   i ca n't imagine something like the at&t warrantless wiretapping happening in western europe . 
  [ right mistakes never happen around here ... ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/german-government-accused-of-spying-on-citizens-with-state-sponsored-trojan/4044 )  after all a majority of the population is certainly engaging in it !, 
  after all my mum , dad and grandma always torrent the shit out of the internet & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
   i do n't care if the gov ' t knows about my pirating right , they wo n't get any other data while monitoring you ...  there are clear checks and balances in place to prevent abuses because that is possible , when you have an agency that is working in secret ...  it should n't be any different from tapping someone 's phone and they are changing this to . 
  ever heard of telecommunications data retention ? 
  i think germany is at the moment the only country in the eu that does n't do that one reason for that again being the pirate party , but also the fdp . 
  that 's already where it starts . 
  nobody has a problem if they have a suspect and a court order and than do something like that , but you ca n't just put 82million people under general suspicion . 
   just to further clarify , i think it 's regrettable that people seem to want to continue doing something illegal like filesharing and fight more more online privacy , against mandatory isp logs , etc. 
  - instead of focusing to make something as harmless as filesharing legal in the first place . 
  what do you thinks resonates more with the general public a : `` we want everything for free on the internet '' or b : `` we want to protect civil liberties '' ? 
  how does marriage change those issues regarding children ? 
  if you have child with someone and break up you still have to pay support etc. 
  not does n't matter if married or not . 
  but overall i would like to take up speculum 's aspect from above :  but then all tax deductions for marriages need to go as well and the government will have to start taxing households/undefined groups of people . 
  i think it would be a lot better to just direct this money towards the children directly . 
  instead of giving married couples a tax break give the children free school equipment or stuff like that . 
  if you look at the [ member chart ] ( http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/d/df/mitgliederentwicklung.png ) you will see that in the first 3 years there did n't happen much . 
   if that is how they decide policy its no wonder they 've got basically one idea . 
  https://lqfb.piratenpartei.de/ btw . 
  the reason they do n't have an answer for everything yes , is because even though the use liquid feedback it is still just a preselection tool and the final decision will always be made with a vote on a federal party convention . 
   you have actual pre-election campaigns for candidates the problem is that many people are lazy and do n't to become that involved in politics and even worse in the us than in germany . 
  which means there are very few people actually voting in the primaries , so even tough it is a democratic process the candidates are sill elected by a few and the general population then usually has the choice between the two candidates who actually have a chance at winning the election . 
  whereas in germany people can just go to vote once , but still can choose between more than 2 parties .
