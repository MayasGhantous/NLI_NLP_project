  i doubt making a cut in the vagina as a baby or kid is going to hurt much as an adult . 
  i have dozens of scars and cuts from choldhood and non of them hurt . 
  fgm is n't just the worst version of cutting out everything down there and sewing it shut . 
  just a cut without any skin removal is fgm . 
   it 's not like i 'm missing something . 
  my penis has been the same since i could remember it . 
  i find it absolutely weird when i see a girl give a handjob to a cut guy in porn . 
  sure it works and you are used to it , but from my perspective you are missing something . 
  fgm includes pricing a needle into the clitoris or just making a small cut without removing anything . 
  even these things are illegal here even thought they cause less harm . 
  why should any kind of cutting around on children genitals for no medical reason be legal ? 
  not to mention it 's not just about sensitivity . 
  it 's simply absolutely unnecessary and no reason to make any kind of body modification to children if they have a perfectly normal and healthy body part . 
  especially since it also removes the functionality the foreskin provides . 
  so fgm with anaesthetics in a nice hospital is fine ? 
  do i need a vagina to be opposed to fgm ? 
  americans on reddit will always tell your how it protects from infections , penile cancer or hiv ... 
   we 've discussed this extensively on this sub . 
  the bottom line is that outlawing it would be foolish - you 're not going to stop muslims and jews from following thousands of years of tradition/religion . 
  in the best case scenario , they will just do it in other countries . 
  most likely , though , they will just have a `` black market '' of unlicensed people performing circumcisions with occasional disastrous results . 
  or simply have collaborating doctors fake a medical necessity for them . 
  exactly the same argument could be made about fgm , which all western countries have banned . 
  so following your logic we should not ban circumcision bur rather legalize fgm . 
  are you actually from switzerland ? 
  because you sound more like a cut american . 
  or are your jewish ? 
  those gods are also pretty stupid . 
  ca n't even design a perfect human . 
   so , although i 'm against circumcision , i oppose banning it . 
  this is not a solution . 
  so you want to legalize fgm , too ? 
   there was a newspaper students got for free in finland did they just get it or had to sign up for it ? 
  i 'm not going to explain this music to a / r/europe mod . 
  that 's just too embarrassing . 
  did you even understand what the reference was ? 
  serious questions . 
  you never know what happens in the future . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  i agree it 's incredible unlikely it 's western europe is going to turn into such a direction , but i also would never have thought donald trump could become president . 
  yes , but not always on me and i can choose to not bring it somewhere . 
  in addition 99 % of the time location data is off so you usually ca n't pinpoint the exact location . 
  tells you when you where somewhere and who else was there . 
  it is not to difficult to match your purchase to the items if you get access to the stores data . 
  and even without sometimes the business alone might be enough to know e.g. 
  brothel, 
   austria always feels so backwards . . 
  meanwhile sweden is about to become the stasis wet dream . 
   i never did , they are not in the fridge in supermarkets . 
  neither are most vegetables or fruits , but many still last longer in the fridge . 
   the closure of autonomous assembly centers ( eg the rote flora in hamburg ) ( 41 percent ) just fyi that 's extreme left . 
  so why does exactly austria care sooooo much . 
  oh yeah because their citizens go to germany very often . 
   it is not the toll itself our government wants to fight that is really what they care about though , because it will suck out money out of the country . 
  we still lack those super obese people . 
  stuff like if there is some good restaurant near the hotel staying and maybe drive me there ? 
  i want good working conditions and i do n't think a us company run by a libertarian guy will ever provide that . 
   and customers willing to use the service . 
  of course they are when uber has the cheapest prices thanks to ignoring things like drives having a valid commercial car insurance . 
  do you want your driver to pull up google every time you have some basic question ? 
   as far as i understand the original idea was ride-sharing it 's not ride sharing when the customer decides the destination and the driver has no interest in going there . 
  ride sharing is if i ** want ** to go somewhere and look for passengers who also want to go there . 
  [ probably does n't work very well with all the green screens ] ( https://youtu.be/9omhgy0ws-0?t=4s ), 
  same shit in germany ... https://www.telekom.de/unterwegs/tarife-und-optionen/streamon, 
  and once the whole country uses it nobody gets anything back , because all prices go up to account for cc card fees . 
  but why pay entry level luxury money when all you get for it is a ipad ? 
  why not just go for a regular midsize car then ? 
  so instead of all of that you rather spend the same amount and basically just get one ipad ? 
  i do n't feel like this is very cluttered . 
   there 's a huge waiting list to get one nope . 
  you can buy factory new cars straight away . 
  you think a single touch screen with a giant wood trim in front of it will look better once you look closer ? 
   too lazy or you know it 's just physics . 
  mercedes does the same . 
  others probably , too . 
  also if i 'm buying a german premium car the interior matters . 
  if you just want horsepower get a american one . 
  except that all manufacturers are selling in the same places . 
  less regulation in europe also mean americans and japanese manufacturers wo n't work so hard to meet those standards . 
  on the other hand more regulations in the us or china means germans have to meet those , too . 
   their cars are really shitty [ but somehow this is a premium high quality interior ? 
  ] ( http://cdn.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-model-3-interior-side-dash-2-04272017-teslarati.jpg ), 
  unless i really need to travel long distances all the time i 'd get the [ e-golf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyogx_twrm4 ) over this [ pos interior ] ( https://cdn.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/blue-model-3-interior-side-dash-closeup-04272017-teslarati.jpg ) every day ... 
  so what ? 
  1000 bucks that are 100 % refundable is n't a big commitment . 
  and making and selling 400k cars still does n't mean you will be profitable doing so . 
  tesla has nothing that can [ compete with the luxury of a s-class ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s24pduyi3ne ), 
   * we really have so much to do that we will be able to hire even more extraordinary talents * you wo n't get such a talent in such a remote location unless you are willing to pay serious money , which it does not really seem like tesla is willing to do . 
   tesla fremont is set up in the same way there is no fucking way elon has to deal with the shitty parking situation at the factory . 
   it is my firm belief that the separation of the workplace into `` executives '' and `` employees '' does not create a good working environment . 
  we want to create a system of equality without artificial barriers so that someone can start as a trainee and one day lead the entire company . 
  this is why we eliminate all the special privileges of the executives . 
  for example , ** everyone will have equal access to parking ** ... 
  i actually had to laugh when i read that the first time . 
  like elon does n't have some dedicated parking at the us factory . 
  sure ... 
  because people here are also looking at this from the perspective of employees . 
  a raise is n't worth anything if the company goes bankrupt or elon decides that he rather want to focus the automation r&d in california close the the hq . 
  sure it * can * work out great , but it 's all eggs in one basket now . 
  we do n't know how the deal went , what promises were do n't and so on .
