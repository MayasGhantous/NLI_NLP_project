   and you do n't save any money . 
  of course i save money . 
  uber takes like 20 % . 
  the driver can give me a 10 % discount and still makes more . 
  he could even give me the full 20 % and would still save money due to taxes etc. 
   taxis often say no in many european coutries that not legal and you can report them . 
   the passenger can give them 0 stars and uber will investigate the driver i do n't think the rating will work out that great in the end . 
  the problem is that it 's always your word against the driver , so he could just say he did n't feel save , you wanted to bring alcohol or food into the car etc. 
  also right now mostly entusiasts are using the service , with more avage people using it the ratings are going to drop . 
  in addition uber ca n't afford to kick all their drivers . 
   uber is , on average , 40 % cheaper than traditional taxis . 
  have you actually ever looked closer at that ? 
  i checked out some distances i usually take with the cab and the savings with ubere were like 5 % . 
  also do you really think it 's possible to have 40 % cheaper prices and the costs for gas and wear & tear is something every service has to deal with ? 
  drivers in some areas are already complaining that the make very little money after the last price cuts . 
   uber 's surge pricing kicks in very infrequently , and you 're always alerted when it is in effect . 
  and that helps me how when i stand at the club at 3am and want to go home ? 
  ca n't wait to pay 30 $ instead of 15 $ every time ...  so why would a criminal target an uber driver if he does n't carry any money ? 
  he probably still has some nice electronics and just because uber requires not cash does n't mean the driver does not carry any . 
  and call your mayor for comcast !, 
   tl ; dr : the debate here is between making uber legal and regulating it vs. making uber illegal . 
  i do n't really think there is such a big difference . 
  bascially what a lot of people think is if you legalize it then close to what cabs currently are . 
  i doubt uber would see that as legalized . 
  then the eu should just fuck those services . 
  either they adopt and tell the us to fuck off or they stop operating in europe and we get some nice startups . 
  heck i would even be fine with the eu subsidizing something . 
   but uber can eliminate this . 
  you really expect every citizen then to have a smartphone with an app ? 
  going to be really awesome for all the older people . 
  also foreigners arriving at the airport or train station . 
  not to mention mobile data can be pretty expensive . 
  also what 's going to happen is that drivers build networks with their regular customers and will then not use the app . 
  while you could get a cab driver for not having the meter activated , there is pretty much nothing you can do against a private driver . 
  now sure how the laws are in spain but in germany . 
  * insurance - uber only covers while you have a passenger , but you private insurance might not cover inbetween rides , because you are still using you car commercially . 
  ( also their insurance is a big joke compared to german requirements ) * no mandatory area coverage / can deny requests . 
  cabs are usually regulated in that regard . 
  * subsequently pricing . 
  cabs usually have fixed rates , while uber has surge pricing . 
  can become really expensive for customers and encourages drivers only to drive at prime times . 
  then there are things like a license to transport passenger which they actually could get here , but obviously is not required by uber , because it 's significant investment for new drivers . 
  taxes - here i do n't see the problem so much with uber , but that if it replaces cabs then drivers would try to drive without the app no fee to uber , no taxes . 
  also driver safety , i think cabs in germany all have a emergency button , something uber driver will lack and could make them targets for criminals . 
  i have it for some accounts , but it simply does not work that great if you also use the stuff on your phone , multiple desktops etc. . 
  the advantage of gmail is that it applies all the filters even before i see it on my iphone or any other device and is viewable in the browser . 
  i wish there was a better alternative , but not even apple or outlook beat gmail . 
   three appear on explosives charges ca n't even find what google removed , but might have been darren o'donagh http://www.thefreelibrary.com/court+acquits+bomb+suspect.-a083184041  ` lost dog ' dispute resolved ' k  your views : global terror threat guess someone made a stupid comments and now regrets it . 
   asian quake - missing persons meh . 
  again a forum page , this time about people looking for missing friends after an earthquake . 
   jerusalem diary : hummus wars probably again a comment . 
  boring stuff . 
   newspaper targeted in ` evil ' computer plot i do n't see for what reason google removed that . 
  seems relevant . 
  maybe because of the depression thing ? 
  ( also can still find it looking for * william culbert daily mail * )  ** man cleared ** of stabbing celtic fan near downing street ...  student ` crashed car into steps ' druk driving . 
  guess it depends if you still see this as relavant after 6 years . 
  some might say it 's also for this the law was made . 
   ` idiot ' car thief avoids prison 10 years ago . 
  might also be something some people say spirit of the law and others disagree . 
   briton guilty of running vice ring seems relevant . 
  but again ca n't find for what it was removed , maybe for a different name . 
  -- so yeah a lot the removals seem just to be comments , which people might not like to see as first search result for their name , which can happen fast due to bbcs good ranking . 
  others seem to be innocent . 
  some 50:50 spirit of the law or maybe not . 
  some should not be remove , but you just be in the last for a different name mentions in the article . 
   and it is exactly how it will be done in most of europe in a decade or so , after tesla rolls out the model 3 , and several other manufacturers ( dacia , skoda ) start making sub 20k electric cars . 
  sub 20k with decent specs is not going to happen anytime soon . 
  also i do n't see why suddently in the future they would subsidize it when the cars themselves get more and more attractive . 
  now and in the past would have been the time to do so not in 10 years . 
  considering all the kindergardens , hostpitals etc. 
  they run . 
   in a 2012 trial against the former bayernlb chief risk officer gerhard gribkowsky , the public prosecutor accused ecclestone of being a ** co-perpetrator ** in the case . 
  so i guess some other cases were more clear . 
  reddit agrees : http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/2cog19/f1_chief_ecclestone_offers_court_100_mn_to_quash/cjhfnxc http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2cofgi/german_prosecutors_say_they_would_accept_an_offer/cjhflzv http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2co7vp/f1_boss_bernie_ecclestone_offers_60m_settlement/cjheiuc http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/2co00q/ecclestones_100m_getoutofjail_card/cjhcvn6, 
  http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/englisch_stpo.html#p1234 bascially the court figures out they have not yet enought evidence and might not get it , but also are n't sure he is innocent . 
  if the crime then is n't too severe then they have the option to stop `` wasting '' time with it if the defendant agrees to the conditions . 
  edit : op actually quoted the relevant part in the comments . 
  the law if anyone want to read it : http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stpo/englisch_stpo.html#p1234, 
   and financial problems to european ones . 
  3 2 1 ... csu tries to ban asian carriers from landing in europe . 
   which is best explained by a bit of a mind-bending insanity chart . 
  yeah it 's bullshit . 
  1:1 translated a page from the english wiki and someone put it into my sandbox . 
  it 's still sitting there . 
  honestly if you do n't want my contribution then go to hell . 
  the us google site . 
   while the term `` endl\u00f6sung '' does translate to `` final solution '' , it 's not a generic german word . 
  on student used that in front of like 200 people when talking about batteries and what do with them ( recycle etc. ), 
  `` we have n't found a final solution to deal with them yet '' he definetly brought himself a akward moment on silence . 
  although not everybody in the audiance got it . 
  doto masterrace, 
  i honestly ca n't listed to that . 
  faking that german accent ... one moment he speaks perfect english and a second later he make all those basic stereotypical wrong pronunciations . 
  edit : ok it actually gets better . 
  they have been using openstreetmap a few times so they are trying . 
   basic sanity . 
  this so much . 
  every time americans on / r/worldnews tell me germany is just spying as much in the us i can just shake me head . 
  it simply makes not sense , you have so much more to lose when its discover than you could ever gain ...
