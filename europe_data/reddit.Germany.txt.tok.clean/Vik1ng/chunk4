  except that you always end up standing on peoples feet . 
  yeah i read it again and then looked up illegible if it meant something like expired too , but nope just really means not readable . 
  i 'm pretty sure the german police would pull you over right away , too . 
  google can probably block that at any moment if they want to . 
  speak for yourself . 
  you still have a special place in our hearts ^ nice ^ airport, 
  it 's mainly because the us imported tiger data all over the country https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/topologically_integrated_geographic_encoding_and_referencing, 
  for me it was mainly about that in the beginning , but now i also see a lot of advantages beside that . 
  * unlimited offline maps * i personally like all the information that is in there . 
  ever tried to find a bicycle tube vending machine in google ? 
  osm : http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/3xw * a lot of possibilities to create custom maps , because openstreetmap provides raw map data . 
  google just gives you nice looking images . 
  * raw map data also also for cool stuff like making a computer game with that data * connectivity to other open projects like wikidata/wikipedia . 
  * businesses do n't have to pay as much for google ( forsquare , pinterest and nother have switched to osm from google ) * edit : also can we stop this stupid downvoting on this sub ? 
   except germany i always love it when you [ run certain querries ] ( http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/3xw ) and the pretty much represents germany . 
  data imports ... 
  just think of it , there probably does n't even exist a form * blatt * for this kind of accident . 
  their day bascially runied . 
  are you offering to take our nuclear waste ? 
  also german villains speaking german like everybody else in the movie ... 
   but under the new rules all eu countries will have the same data protection laws , meaning companies will no longer be able to challenge which laws apply to them in court . 
  so far germany could for example do little , because the servers were in ireland not germany . 
   in case of the pedophile , these news articles could help daycare centers screen the past of applicants to prevent certain trauma-inducing disasters . 
  do n't most employers in other countries demand a [ police clearance certificate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminal_record#germany ) ? 
  so what you are saying is the norwegian politicians completely failed to represent its people . 
  mainly because the uk is protecting its national interests . 
  on the other hand why have n't i read a single article about that ? 
  i think to some extent it is also up to citizen and local politicians to raise awareness before the vote . 
   no matter how you look at it , it is easier to write a law that fits norway than it is to write one that fits norway , denmark , greece , germany etc etc etc. 
  of course it is , but then we are also never going to pass a data protection law for europe , because lacking regulation benefits irelands economy . 
   then the media inthronized some marina wei\u00dfband as an eloquent girl with some avantgardesk aura as a gallion figure . 
  but that was when they were doing the best . 
  yes , that was n't really how the pirate party wanted it to be , but with maria or christopher lauer you had people that were liked . 
  the problem was when they elected people like ponader or bernd who was as charismatic as a potato . 
   instead , they should say : we do n't have fraction discipline , so that pp-delegates can vote with the cdu on one issue , with the spd on the next and even with the fdp on others ( i know the fdp is not significant right now , just think yourself back 5 years ) . 
  they did . 
  the problem is simpyl if you want publicity and want your party represented in a talkshow then you have to send someone who lays down you party manifesto . 
  no it 's not the order . 
  it 's the emphasis she puts on asylum . 
  it 's the priorities . 
  see the way you listed it , is what i would have expected from a pirate party candidate ( maybe except for the first point or limited to europe . ), 
  but if you look at your bullet points and compare it to the text the last point bascially got twice as much weight there and even got expanted to a not so much core idea . 
  mentioning copyright crammed in into a long sentence , while making a closing statement about wanting to fight for better asylum rights in the eu ? 
  already having mentioned human rights explicitly in the sentence before . 
  not to mention starting off with open borders , which then obviously does not just mean open borders inside the eu . 
  yeah , that was the 0.5 of the 2.5  put in a edit . 
  but of me the problem is simply when i read this :  `` i would like a free europe with open borders . 
  these include for me maintain and expand open communication structures , the relaxation and harmonization of copyright and the opening of the european institutions for political participation through active transparency . 
  particularly in the case of transparency , it 's not just about the mere publication of information , but their preparation in a form that invites you to join me . 
  the eu itself must also outwardly not foreclose , but has to take their commitment to human rights seriously . 
  that 's why i want to use me for a dignified asylum , `` as reda about their motivation for candidacy . 
  what she thinks is important and for me the basic pirate values do n't really stick out there . 
  it 's the parties own fucking fault !!!, 
  -- candidate list : https://www.piratenpartei.de/grenzenlos-europa/eu-kandidaten-2014/ * # 1 you have you women who talks about the openess of europe , human right and asylum . 
  oh and basic income for the eu in the election spot ( not to mention studying politics , beeing in the spd for 6 years before ... so textbook career politician ) edit : yes , she also tralks about transparency , neutrality , copyright ... * # 2 you have guy whose twitter profile is `` social liberal pirate against facism '' . 
  ( if that was really important for me the left has been an option since forever ) * # 3 open government , married to wikileaks spokesperson etc. 
  * # 4 musician & producer actually working with copyright * # 5 anti-fascist action supporter ( women ) with focus on immigration and asylum ( [ pretty much one of their biggest fuck ups ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos-skaliert/femen-37080523-qf-34787212/2,w=650,c=0.bild.jpg ) ** nsfw ** * titts * ) the problem ? 
  first of all 2.5 of the top 5 candidates bascially have no focus at all on the founding ideas of the pirate party . 
  then the best two candidates are on postion 3 & 4 . 
  position 5 is a candidate that should never have been anywhere on a list of the pirate party . 
  and do n't even get me started on fuckups like [ this  ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-412808-galleryv9-jiua.jpg ) ( yeah , that 's the leader of the party in on of germanys biggest talkshows on public tv ) ** tl ; dr ** if you want the support of the german internet community do n't make your party look like a * the left 2.0 *, 
  it 's a pretty old law and was passed in different times where it probably made sense to some extent . 
  for example free music was rare and the gema was the only company dealing with it back then . 
  and now politicians do n't want to stand up against it , because you obviously want the support of all those celebrities who benefit from it . 
  look at how close it was that some parties got a seat or did n't get one . 
  that should be all the reason you need . 
  and yes also one seat can sometimes make a difference . 
  i mean i would understand it if voting was some big hassle but overall voting by mail maybe took me 5min . 
  seems like it 's mainly to force them to keep certain standards : respect minorities , human rights etc. 
  at least that 's what the wikipedia sounds like, 
  afd, 
  not really . 
  federal election had 71.5 % and they got 1.3 % . 
  party | 2014 | seats | 2009 : - :| : - :| : - :| : - : cdu/csu ( conservatives ) | 36 % | 36 | 37,9 % spd ( social democrats ) | 27,5 % | 28 | 20,8 % gr\u00fcne ( greens ) | 10,5 % | 10 | 12,1 % linke ( left ) | 7,5 % | 7 | 7,5 % fdp ( liberals ) | 3 % | 3 | 11,0 % afd ( euro-skeptics ) | 6,5 % | 6 rest :| 9 % | 6, 
  [ do not all passports state if you are a eu member ?

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqtz_c3cyhe although i think the text is not part of it just the ode to joy `` music '' itself . 
  i maybe should have tuned down the sound when i saw the text and still had my window open ... 
  well , thats kinda backwards . 
  do you even have that for any election ? 
  in germany voting by mail is pretty much just as easy you just have to fill out the form you get mailed and mail it back to get you ballot and the turnout is still very low in the eu election . 
  wait you do n't have voting by mail ? 
  makes me happy voting by mail has become so easy in germany , 
  with the pirates destoying themselves the greens are probably soon going to be the only party besides the left standing up against stuff like acta or stupid internet laws . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  a main reason for her `` support '' is that the spd simply sucks when it comes do candidates . 
  honestly ca n't think of one that i would consider much better than her . 
  just that they were more likely to get votes 5 years ago than they are now . 
  well , they could have gotten much more if they did n't turn into some left wing 2.0 party . 
  could n't be that google has collected 10000x the information and a tracker on almost every important website to figure out what users what ? 
  and especially business . 
  the difference between beeing on page 1 or 2 for a keyword could be millions of lost or gained revenue for a big company . 
   ( ie being bundled with windows and leveraging that against competitors ) . 
  exactly like google bundels services ... 
  yes . 
  and this is something people always underestimate when they say `` just use another search engine '' or `` just build your own search engine '' . 
  well , nobody is going to install my tracker if there are no benefits for them . 
  if not even 10 % of my traffic comes from bing , why bother to analyze that when i have everything in google . 
  which then also means no other search engine has the same amount of information to even stand a chance against google in the first place . 
  which then would be : `` release the search data they have . '',
