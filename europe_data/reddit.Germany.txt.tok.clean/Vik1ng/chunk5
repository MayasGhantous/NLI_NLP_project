   for instance when you search something new , it gives you a list of best bets , and after you chose the link you think it 's appropriate , it returns that as a top link for all future searches . 
  that 's certainly not how it works . 
  yes the amount of clicks and how long people stay on the site are a factor , but not as big as you make it look like . 
  still doing better than the german one ... not really suprising tough . 
  so why is bing failing to deliver ? 
   jump-start how , without the inforamtion google has collected over years ? 
   do n't forget other search engines . 
  google holds 67 % of the market ( opposed to over 90 % of desktop operating systems for microsoft ) . 
  that 's united states ... europe : http://returnonnow.com/internet-marketing-resources/2013-search-engine-market-share-by-country/  if microsoft 's servers die , skydrive is useless . 
  you can use word long after microsoft dies . 
  so my cad software that requires connecting to the server to work is just as service , too ? 
   that 's a flawed analogy . 
  it 's up to the company to decide whether to offer their product on linux . 
  it 's also up to the website which tracker to install . 
  but it 's not up to them what tracker other companies install , which you need if you want some kind of comparison and look the bigger picture . 
   i still do n't see why . 
  people are using search engines mainly google these days to find businesses . 
  want your business to be found ? 
  make sure you rank good on google . 
   those are not services . 
  apples to oranges . 
  so skydrive is a service and word is n't ? 
  where exactly is the difference ? 
   so you can easily move away from google , but you do n't want to , because they cover a bigger part of the market ( i.e. 
  track more people ) . 
  same reason why many companies do n't offer their product for linux / macosx , windows just dominates the market . 
  developing for linux is up to the software company , installing trackers on websites out there is not up to microsoft . 
   not , really , same goes for business . 
  moving away from microsoft is far more difficult than moving away from google . 
  moving away from google when doing seo is ** impossible ** . 
   and i am a phd student and most of my documents and other people 's documents i work with are on latex if you are a phd student you are already using office for much more than the average home user out there . 
   that 's like saying `` can i use linux on windows '' . 
  it 's just dumb , these are competing services offered by different websites . 
  no that would be can i run bing on google . 
   it 's just dumb , these are competing services offered by different websites . 
  you mean like ie is competing with firefox and chrome ? 
  yet i have the choice to use all of them on windows . 
   http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster[1] 90 % of the population is not using bing , so they ca n't offer me the same as google . 
  also just check reddit : do they have a google tracker ? 
  yes . 
  do they have a bing tracker ? 
  now you can guess which webmaster tools will offer me better information . 
   because they use software written for windows which is already a pretty big factor . 
  if you use google.com you have no choice other than using google software . 
  you can easily replace ie with firefox , but you ca n't replace googlemaps with openstreetmap in your search results . 
   for home users , it only takes a few clicks to change your default search engine , email provider and other online services . 
  and you just ignored half of my argument . 
   changing your operating system and all programs that you use is far more complicated and you ca n't even do it in many cases . 
  switching to openoffice is no problem at all for most home users . 
  yes , windows is a bit more complicated , but on the other hand microsoft does not dictate what you can install on windows . 
  but can i run skydrive on google.com ? 
  can i use openstreetmaps ? 
  can i get stuff recommended my friedns liked on facebook instead of google + ? 
   also , there are plenty of analytics and advertising solutions that do n't rely on google at all . 
  which other tool gives you information about what 90 % of the people are searching out there ? 
  show you which search term go them to you website ? 
  how likely they are to land on your site when looking for that term and not on your competitors website ? 
   why has n't there been a project to rectify this because it is pretty much impossible to compete with google because you lack : * the data of years of data collection * trackers on pretty much every larger website ( right now unless you blocked it google is tracking you ) * a userbase to start, 
   that gabriel could n't actually explain how it was supposed to work . 
  make the algorythm public . 
  release the search data they have . 
   if there was an attempt to disband them coming from within the eu , google would probably tell them to fuck right off and stop doing business in europe ? 
  except that when it comes to banking or cars there is a lot of competition . 
  and many of siemens products have a lot of competition , just look at home appliances . 
  there are some factors that make a huge difference in my opinion . 
  the main thing is that microsoft mainly just sells software , which is the same for everybody . 
  meanwhile google provides a search and map service , which affects every business differently . 
  google decides if it likes a certain way a website is designed or is n't . 
  and just the fact that google is used by so many means that if you want to analyse traffic you have to use google , if you want to run ads in a search engine you have to use google . 
  also when it comes to software at least to some exent the business itself has a choice , when it comes to search it 's bascially up to millions of users out there which search engine they use . 
  a company can switch to linux , but they ca n't get their potential customers to switch away from google . 
   strong pirates looking who is on place 5 . on the lists it 's pretty much a joke, 
  probably going to happen after the election . 
  or at least more member will leave . 
  you usually need a huge amount of signatures though . 
  99 % chance that will be country locked .

   it turns out differently every time i scribble it anyways . 
  you still have a unique handwriting . 
  so even if you wrote something different every time and expert could later see if you wrote it or someone else .

  tagesschau is a public tv station , basically bbc . 
  not sure about the netherlands , but in germany you look for this : [ cdu/csu ],

  does this now mean that we get the money back for not implementing it ?

   submarine cables carrying data from locations such as africa and afghanistan this * might * at least be somehow justified and useful fighting terrorism . 
  just like the 500 metadata files germany gave the nsa where all about afghanistan but after the recent scandals i guess nobody trusts any government to just limit it on those things . 
  i think the first step is to get linux into the governments and create more initiative to develop and support it . 
  often government computers just need to be able to get a few very specific tasks done . 
  what about google ? 
  you can start here : www.openstreetmap.de ;d, 
  sky does n't have any . 
  they ca n't get away with that here in germany when people already pay 50 $, 
  still going to pirate that shit , because i do n't want to wait 12h longer xd, 
  why did n't / r/mapgore become a thing : /, 
   but unless otherwise specified , a parent is the steward of the child 's rights until it gets older . 
  which is exactly what the government specifies here . 
  yeah it 's kind nice when you have areas where nobody lives anywhere close ... those do n't exist in germany .
