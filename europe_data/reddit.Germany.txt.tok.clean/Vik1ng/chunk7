  spanish meps will want your vote so you have a better chance there , of course that situation sucks when you do n't trust them . 
  or the nfl rules . 
  at least there are enough commercials so i manage to explain the game to my friends just in time for the 4th quarter to start ;d, 
   downvotes ? 
  really ? 
  well , there are obviously a few polish guys here who do n't have a hot girlfriend . 
  the reason german is against this the way it was proposed , is because it would allow banks to directly get money of this european safety fund . 
  bank in your country fucks up ? 
  well , european fund will pay for it . 
  they would not even be able to go bankrupt , so they would just start those risk investments again . 
  but where is merkel a good ruler ? 
  i feel that there are almost no decisions where she really led the party/government . 
  maybe with nuclear power , but apart from that i felt like she was more the spokesperson of the party than a big leader . 
  foreign relations is the only thing which i feel she does a good job . 
  i do n't like that one very much . 
  it lacks a lot of parties . 
  in germany at least pirates and afd should be in there , if not more . 
  in addition i honestly doubt that anyone would base his vote on a question like  should member states and sports organisations be encouraged to fly the eu flag at major sports events ? 
  in germany most young people are n't huge fans of merkel 's party . 
   undemocratic eu you realize that eurosceptic parties are the last ones that are going to make the eu more democratic ? 
  damn you are right . 
  but that would of course be even better because then they would pretty much be guaranteed to send someone . 
  euro \u2260 europe ... why is this so complicated even for people in this sub : /, 
  their german wikipedia article actually does n't read that bad . 
  try finding a party in your country that matches much better . 
  maybe you will find something around 70-80 % if you are lucky , but coming close to 100 % almost never happens , especially if that party then also is supposed to have a chance in the election . 
  hav n't seens any [ afd ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_for_germany ) voters so far . 
   as merkel compared to german politics they seem to have far more in common with the [ alternative for germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_for_germany ), 
  probably pirate party if the threshold is 3 % ( constitutional court is still on that one i think ) also have to check out the result of the party convention today when i come home but if there is no major fuck up they probably got my vote as they are the only ones who really care about the copyright , data protection and privacy . 
  [ could be a lot more but americans ruined it ] ( http://youtu.be/npltl7mtijg?t=3m34s ) :(, 
  kurzarbeit - short time work  in 2009 , the german government had budgeted 5.1 billion euros on the program , which replaced some of the lost income of over 1.4 million workers . 
  the program was favorably cited in a 2009 organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) report , which stated that it had saved nearly 500,000 jobs during the recession . 
  ( even if the numbers might not be 100 % correct , i still think it had a substantial contribution to the low unemployment these days ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_time, 
   so i do n't see what the problem is . 
  honestly this mainly coming from bavaria and the main reason iprobably is that people there have to pay every time they visit one of the surrounding countries . 
  if it is going skying to austria these days or driving to italy in summer . 
  if no country would have these tolls germany would probably do n't get them either , but the reality is most countries in europe have them . 
  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:car_toll_map_of_the_world.png  on a side note , sweden gets all heavy traffic going to norway . 
  did n't know that . 
  is n't it more effective to take the ship directly to norway ? 
  everybody has to pay . 
  but if your car is registered in germany the tax that you pay for the car will be reduced , so you do n't pay more in the end . 
  which it is n't in germany either . 
  german will have to pay it too , ** but ** they will reduce the car tax making it a zero sum game . 
  austria did exactly the same when they introduced it . 
  there will be cheaper options for a week/month or something like that . 
  but yes the main goal is to target people just passing through . 
  you mean the fee or better roads ? 
  i have not heard anything about this . 
  especially as there are also other countries like the netherlands which do n't have tolls . 
  it would also be especially strange considering germans themselves have to pay it . 
  i do n't think there will be ** any ** exceptions . 
   except it does n't discriminate against foreginers with the tax loophole - everyone pays . 
   i 'm swedish , and you can drive on our roads without paying fees . 
  look at a map and the location of sweden and germany . 
  when i drive on swedish roads i 'm probably to 99 % a tourist there or doing business . 
  meaning i will actually bring some money to the country . 
  on the other hand many people just drive through germany ( [ just see comment above ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tgdni/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week/ce7ps62 ) ) and do n't even pay for fuel taxes , because the fuel tank lasts long enough . 
   charging tourists for driving their cars on german roads for wear and tear seems silly when a truck causes about 10,000 times more damage than a car . 
  that 's why some time ago germany already implemented a road toll for all trucks , which actually is more advanced and works on the distance you drive . 
   also , it goes against the fundamental eu principle of free movement of persons . 
  what ? 
  dozen of eu countries have road tolls . 
  yes there is . 
  pretty much every other party argued 24/7 that what they want is not possible due the the eu . 
  in germany due to data collection and protection such solutions are really unpopular . 
  it 's not unlikely . 
  those options will be there ... ( 10 days , a month , ... ) there is even some eu law that requires you to have such options . 
  and bavarian . 
  that 's usually not how it works . 
  although it could be different in norway , but i would find that hard to believe . 
  i mean with tax brackets it 's the same . 
  you pay 28 % on those fist 54000 even if you make 600000 , you will only play the higher rate for the additional 16000, 
   4730 if you did n't make too much over a short period then this `` tax free '' amount that 's usually applied over a whole year can make bug difference in the amount of taxes . 
  i would have expected more votes against it , because in the next election voters now even certainly know that the spd members stand behind the grand coalition and the coalition paper . 
  now you ca n't just switch the leadership and say that you are on a new course . 
  that 's why most people have their money in a bank account . 
  where the bank is responsible for it in the first place . 
  and if there is a fault ( even on your side ) there might be a transaction history if something goes wrong . 
  there are limits on how much you can withdraw on a day . 
  you can freeze the card . 
  or credit cards offer protection . 
  if something raises a red flag like your account is suddenly being accessed from a different country they can notify you and take actions . 
  on the other hand following they coins to the block chain might at some point not work anymore . 
  there are even services that they to prevent you from doing exactly that : http://bittumble.com/, 
  at least we do n't have any bribery in parliament / s, 
  exactly . 
  if at all this brings a huge amount of money to spain when people spend all their pensions there . 
  not really . 
  how are they taking away conservative issues ? 
  i hav n't seen one issue they have adopted from the cdu . 
   so they can find something else easier said than done . 
   merkel 's in a real bind on this one . 
  i think the real problem for her is that her party is losing more and more issues every year . 
  that 's also why she is so akwad on gays adopting children . 
  i honestly think she has no problem with it , but she simply knows that she ca n't give up all conservative issues . 
  [ the obvious solution ] ( http://youtu.be/thoxw19vstg ), 
  then what 's the point ? 
  do you really think that will change their mind ? 
   to foreign intelligence agencies they should just say 3rd parties and then regulate hwo warrents etc.
