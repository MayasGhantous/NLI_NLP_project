  i think a lot of germans work on their houses if they own then , but yeah sunday it 's a pretty big no go to make any noise . 
  it 's more that it has huge economic costs, 
  [ should have used an android phone . 
  would have been much cheaper ] ( http://youtu.be/qxwdg4gjvj0?t=2m56s ), 
  well , you are trading children . 
  you better feel ashamed . 
  http://i.imgur.com/i9yc5.jpg ( [ source ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/u8qmh/i_made_a_european_version_of_those_american_pride/ ) ), 
  yeah i do n't think that 's a good idea . 
  i think it should really be taxes that affect business . 
  but even there you have to be carefull , so you do n't hurt companie with a small workforce a lot harder . 
  finding the right tax is really the critical point here . 
   because everyone who try to move there . 
  you could easily put up regulations , which require you to having lived and worked there are certain amount of time in oder to qualify . 
  in the meantime people who work could still get that income , but lose it if they do n't have a job . 
  the state has to get the money somwhere . 
  so i guess your employer will end up paying around those 2500 more in taxes . 
   do n't be afraid to break the coalition . 
  that 'd be my advice . 
  which is exactly the problem these small parties have . 
  merkel almost has 50 % . 
  she is not going to compromise that much . 
  which means if the greens go into that coalition they will break a lot of their promises and enable the cdu to do stuff the green voters did not want . 
  every 2 years ... for a few weeks in summer . 
   but slyly team up with the opposition when voting on laws whenever they feel like it . 
  yeah you do that one time and the colalition is done . 
  and you will have a nice utedass . 
  that 's how it works in bavaria with the 2nd vote . 
  alltough that has no influence on the direct candidate from your area which is the first vote . 
  but that 's only the case due to the history of the left . 
  some split of the spd and are seen as `` traitors '' which makes it a bit complicated . 
   something that can be forged by a 5-grader skipping school . 
  just that it ca n't . 
  if the 5-grader would try this on a important document and the case would go to court a speciallist would quickly see that the signature was forged . 
  also up to 5 years in prision ( at least here in germany ) are a serious disencouragement to even try . 
  i really doubt that a song line this will become a oktoberfest hit . 
  if that 's what they a suggesting there . 
  completely agree . 
  if you know it and plan accordingly it 's no big deal . 
  it 's really rare that i though `` well it would be nice if the store is open now '' . 
  and it 's never that necessary that i think having people to work at those times is worth it . 
  the german system is much better . 
  we do n't have any anti corruption laws , because then we would admit that there is corruption . 
  we proudly present : [ the merkelator ] ( http://pirapay.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/424px-nie_wieder_%c3%9cberwachungsstaat_merkel_594x841mm_schlicht_druck_2013-07-29_1.jpg ), 
  so you do n't like civil liberties ? 
   11,7 % it 's more . 
  you also have to add `` others '' so it 's more like 15 % . 
  what troubles me is that 15 % of the votes now bascially do n't count . 
  i 'm not sure , but maybe lower the 5 % treshhold to 4 % ? 
  i think that alone would have a huge physiological effect , because then when you see a party around 3 % it looks more likely they will make it . 
  the funny thing is that if people would use the `` wahl-o-mat '' they would probably show them a party they did n't even consider voting for . 
  do you have any idea how much german and other european banks have invested there . 
  yeah honestly it 's more ridiculous how / r/worldnews does n't give a shit and a rape case in india is more important ... 
   states who are n't fit enough for the euro , like greek , should temporarily leave it and return to a local currency . 
  because that is so easy ... not to mention that they would never be able to repay anything . 
   that 's simply out of question in terms of practicability . 
  while i would not care if someone supported something i like and it would be impossible to do , because i support the idea . 
  but i could never vote for someone who supports something i strongly disagree with . 
  because it does n't matter if he can do it or not this guy supports the idea . 
  which means he probably also supports a lot of other similar issues . 
  it 's like `` hey i have no problem voting for a party that wants to kill all immigrants , because it 's simply out of question in terms of practicability . '', 
   retaking the drachme so all the loans etc. 
  just get wiped out ? 
  then why does n't lucke says it like that ? 
  the problem is that they can bascially only work together with the cdu on economic issues . 
  but the cdu is conservative and not liberal on all the other issues . 
  i do n't even disagree with you . 
  i just do n't think the afd has the solutions to the issue . 
  if it would be that easy as the claim to give greece back its own currency , why would the big parties even be against this ? 
  i simply doubt give them back their own currency =  economic growth =  they pay back all their debt will simply work out like that . 
  especially , because their currency would drop really low . 
  karma is too precious . 
   i do n't believe that merkel wants to go on with the fdp . 
  that party is just a shadow of what it used to be . 
  which would be a lot better for her than the spd , because it wold give her much more power . 
   and one for `` afd '' . 
  i really do n't see what the people expect from the afd . 
  i heard this guy lucke on a talk show ( i think illner ) and what he suggested simply seemed impossible . 
  like getting greece back to their own currency , then devalue it and pay back the euro debts . 
  and the economic growth would make up for the devaluation ? 
  that simply did n't add up at all . 
  nope . 
  most likly http://ardrone2.parrot.com/apps/, 
  they still look pretty loaded, 
  aka ipad, 
  one time we are to [ fast ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blitzkrieg ) , now we are to slow ... you guys are never happy . 
  at least they did n't come with a police helecopter like when the us guys at the dagger complex got a bit scared .

  because this is the only comment left ... wtf happened here oo, 
  i really looks like people in bavaria only vote for the csu or do n't vote at all . 
  and if they do n't like them they will punish them by not voting . 
  that was the main reason for the low turnout back then . 
  i mean you can always just take the train on the next platform which offers a better price . 
  i know . 
  i just ca n't find where i read it . 
  maybe it was on tv . 
  the theory was that people on unemployment benefits etc. 
  tend not to vote in such high numbers in state election was that stuff like unempolyment benefits etc. 
  are all federal issues ( when it comes to the laws ) . 
  really hard to find anything when everything you enter regarding the election are the new news . 
  best i could find was [ this ] ( http://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.merkur-online.de%2faktuelles%2fpolitik%2flandtagswahl-2013%2ftermin-landtagswahl-bayern-offiziell-september-2761067.html ) although the opposition does n't directly confirm my claim , but at least the mention `` more voters '' in addition to the money argument , but i admit a simple wikipedia check ( which i actually did to be sure when writing the other comment ) would have confirmed that , too .
