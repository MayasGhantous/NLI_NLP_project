  after all they did something similar in tibet and still have claims on places like taiwan . 
  amazon is trying to push the competition out of retail and mail order business . 
  in the long run this will result in there being no more competition , which will be bad for the customers as well as the producers . 
  as i understood it this is what france wants to prevent really . 
  dunno why people in / r/worldnews oppose it . 
  in america the government is allowed to prevent or break up monopolies too . 
  is there a law in france that dictates fixed book prices like there is in germany ? 
  because if there is and amazon advertises with `` discounted delivery fees '' that would actually mean false advertisement . 
  the delivery still costs the normal amount , because the package delivery services dont ' t work for free . 
  so amazon effectively pays them with the money charged for the books , which would be the same as circumventing the fixed book price . 
  she ca n't agree to anything but a no-spy deal . 
  spying on the citizens is illegal in germany . 
   also that putin ring story is comedy gold . 
  indeed . 
  but i do n't think the white house refers to russia as `` soviet '' anymore . 
  and what a coincidence it was published at the time when the us and russia were arguing in the unsc about syria . 
  so i guess it is pure fiction . 
  are n't they actually fighting a war against islamists there ? 
  those poeple want to establish some sort of caliphate on russian territory . 
  of course russia fights them . 
  name me one other non-islamic country that would accept something like that . 
  there is no such thing as ** the ** german opinion on it . 
  obviously there are a lot of different opinions . 
  some people don ' t like the noice . 
  some people ( especially the small business owners close to the bases ) like the money they get from dealing with soldiers or the us army . 
  some people hate americans . 
  some people love americans . 
  some people think of the american bases as a way germany is helping them to deploy . 
  some see the bases as proof of us being nothing but a subordinate . 
  if you ask me i 'm fine with the bases as long as the people there abide to german laws . 
  so , do n't spy on us , kidnap people here other illegal shit please . 
  it 's just the polite version of saying gtfo . 
  imho this whole debate is stupid . 
  many people who have 2 passports have them for countries that normally need some sort of visa to visit each other . 
  and most of these people have family in both of these countries . 
  imho they should n't be forced to give up one passport and requiring a visa to visit their parents/families . 
  politicians argue in the lines of `` they get to vote in two countries '' or whatever . 
  if you look on the other side of the coin though you could say , that their vote in the other country is also a subtle tool of influence . 
  because if they are socialized in europe they likely will reflect european values if they vote elsewhere too . 
  the only way i can see it happening is , if we find a way to make use of einstein 's e = mc \u00b2 and become able to convert energy and matter without losses . 
  that would solve all energy problems and at the same time turn rare materials into easily producable as well as solve all waste disposal problems . 
  will it happen ? 
  not anytime soon . 
  you are confusing communism and dictatorship of the proletariat . 
  marx did n't invent communism . 
  he was thinking about ways how to overcome capitalism in an effort to get to communism . 
  and in his theories this would go through the steps of class conflict and dictatorship of the proletariat . 
  of course he was no idiot , so he knew that there would be resistance against it from the people who lose their capital/industrial property . 
  and in his mind stuff would have to be taken from them by force if need be . 
  nazism/fascism did n't stem from marx . 
  also communism does n't actually involve the destruction of anything . 
  it is only a theory , that describes a society in which everyone shares everything with everyone else , more or less . 
  it does n't even need anything like a party or political leaders , because in the theory the people share the same goals and power as well . 
  in reality though it does n't work at the moment , because people do n't want to share everything . 
  so some people somehow declare themselves leaders and usually end up abusing power over minorities and critics . 
  they are abusing the theory . 
  nazism/fascism is inherently violent and xenophobic against anything that is considered different in some way or another . 
  too bad the polish players from dortmund are n't half german too . 
  thinking about it , why are n't you in brazil too ? 
  you have so many awesome players . 
  by the way , the tinpot dictators buy firearms from us . 
  it is strictly illegal to sell such arms to them . 
  yet all 3 german firearms companies are under investigation for doing it . 
  and it looks like they are all guilty . 
   is n't that almost entirely down to the ak47 ? 
  the budget assault rifle of choice for tinpot dictators everywhere ? 
  no , for firearms russia is n't even in the top 10 . 
  afaik they make the most money by selling tanks and fighter jets along with the construction of support equipment and facilities . 
  their main customers are india and china . 
  in fact russia is the 2nd largest exporter of arms world wide . 
  they export almost as much as the us do . 
  and they export more than germany , china , france , uk and spain together . 
  the problem for france is , that russia apparently already paid for the ships . 
  eventually things will get back to normal and the ships wont be ready for service for a few years . 
  if france does not deliver the ships their reputation in international arms deals will be shattered . 
  they will lose every future procurement tender , because their competitors will point it out every time . 
  so if they want to stay an arms exporter in the future they have to deliver these ships . 
  now , one could take the high moral ground and stop arms deals . 
  but we all know this will ruin the arms companies in peace times . 
  and it would n't stop russia or china from exporting . 
  so our politicians are never going to do it . 
  the intention is to exclusively charge non-germans for this by offsetting the vignette for germans through our car taxes . 
  the idea comes from bavarian csu , who promised this during the last election campaing to win votes from extreme right wing voters . 
  i hope the eu stops this madness . 
  this is fucking bullshit . 
  ideas like this will destroy the eu , because it will only motivate other countries to do equally selfish stuff . 
  to be honest i have no clue what erdogan and his government are up to really . 
  all i know is , that tartars and the ottomans were buddies . 
  but how that inspires erdogan or not i ca n't tell . 
  from my point of view erdogan is equally hard to make sense of as putin is . 
  the article linked by the op states it ... 
  well , tartar ships are based in `` kerch , russian federation '' now too . 
  if they want to dock there they will need papers accepted by the russian federation . 
  how likely do you think it is , that the russians will accept them having papers that state kerch is in ukraine ? 
  so if they want to dock in both crimea and turkey they will have to use forged documents , which will then again make them vulnerable to russian police . 
  this will put them in a really bad situation eventually . 
   but to stay on-topic , is it possible that he 's just a kind of `` freelance spy '' , selling information to the highest bidder ? 
  that 's what they are going to charge him for afaik . 
  although i wonder why you say '' ** just ** a kind of freelance spy '' . 
  as i understand it those kind of double agents are the most dangerous , because they sell out to anyone with money .
