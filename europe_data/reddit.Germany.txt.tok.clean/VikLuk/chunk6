  you folks need more than standardized driving lessons . 
  you also need the same high technical inspection standards for your cars and the same quality of highway construction . 
  otherwise unrestricted speeds would be very dangerous . 
  besides , unrestricted speeds in the wrong lane would be dangerous too . 
  actually the treasury in london already said that it will stay the sole party liable for the kingdom 's debts . 
  how much debt to the uk scotland will own depends on what they can agree with the rest of the kingdom after independence . 
  if they come to a fair agreement they will probably base the percentages on gdp , one would assume . 
  so they would n't own more debt than they should . 
  well , the threat is real . 
  but the same or worse threat exists because of americans who radicalize themselves in sysria , does n't it ? 
  they own american passports , making it even easier to enter the us . 
  what obama did there was trying to convince people they need the nsa ( and other such services ) for their security . 
  but is the nsa allowed to wiretap americans ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  there is no precedent to this whole situation . 
  in the end it will be a political decision . 
  if the eu wants scotland in , then this will be a very easy and quick thing to do . 
  by the way , i do n't think anyone has any major doubts about the stability of the scottish economy . 
  they will own the british oil/gas ressources in the north sea , so they 'll probably be fine . 
  and both arguments are bullshit really . 
  by those standards saxony could also make claims on the uk , just because some 1600 years ago saxons colonized parts of the british island . 
  just because there is some analogy in history it does n't make any sense to base today 's politics on it . 
  history has been going on for so long , you probably could fabricate all kinds of retarded claims from it somehow . 
  he was a murderer , but the war was started by politicians , who used the incident . 
  `` empire '' translates to `` reich '' in german . 
  i somehow believe this is not the best name to chose . 
  i 'd prefer a name that right away makes clear it is a democracy and a republic . 
  how about democratic republic of europe ? 
  dr dre would like it , i think . 
  that reads like `` the handbook how to merkel '' ... 
  nah , we do n't despise you . 
  of course there are some stereotypes about polish people . 
  but for the vast majority of germans this is nothing serious really . 
  we have stereotypes about austrains , dutch , french and so on as well . 
  and we like you all the same . 
  i think you are misunderstanding our generally blunt nature . 
  we are n't exactly known for being very comforting or affectionate . 
  so when it seems like we overlook you it rather means , that we are mostly happy with you and just do n't waste the time to tell you , haha . 
  cameron is weak and stupid . 
  we will not give the eurosceptics their way on reforming the eu . 
  that would be like giving the thief the key to the safe . 
  i think you do n't understand . 
  the discussion was about the magna charta not having had that much influence on the peoples lives . 
  it never was considered the basis for binding together the people living in the british empire until recently . 
  people never gave much of a fuck about it . 
  not even the lords who imposed it on the king back when they did cared much about it as history shows . 
  only recently during the last 1 or 2 centuries we ( not only people in britain btw ) started to appreciate its values . 
  as i understood the scottish redditor what is happening now is that the magna charta is being used to rewrite history for some political goal . 
  but that 's bullshit . 
  you do n't have to abandon the good stuff in the magna charta while moving forward . 
  the scots do n't want to throw away their moral or historical values . 
  they just want to leave the british empire . 
  much like the dudes from new england back then ... 
  my point was aiming exactly at that . 
  i 'm pretty sure that scottish redditor did n't live for centuries to have taken part in cherishing it . 
  unless he is ** the ** highlander . 
  you know , with that attitude of yours those mostly british dudes living in new england 240 years ago would n't have declared independence . 
  kinda ironic . 
   you guys dictated it 's effect on your national values when your forefathers heralded it as a national symbol and founding fathers declared that they specifically derived certain principles of their government from the document `` it 's your own fault , that your forefathers made this decision ! '', 
  he did n't compare the iraq war with the ukraine crisis . 
  he only used it as an example , that such big things cause the publishing of quickly written , new books elsewhere too . 
  russia is a capitalist country too in 2014 . 
  so people earn money the same way as in every other capitalist country . 
  edit : an example from germany is uli h\u00f6ne\u00df . 
  shortly after the news of his tax fraud became public there were numerous books being published about it . 
  i doubt they had been pre-written . 
  and i 'm sure they contain mostly blabla or copy-pasta . 
  in germany there is no such thing as a neutral news ** source ** . 
  i do n't know of any media or press , that really send their journalists to the hotspots and have them investigate objectively by themselves . 
  they almost only copy the stuff someone else wrote without even questioning it . 
  some of them like springer are even going as far as inventing shit all the way and do n't care if they get caught . 
  it 's crazy . 
  i trust none of them . 
  i have some faith in switzerland 's nzz newspaper . 
  while i 'm sure they do n't send many of their employees to dangerous hotspots either they at least seem to attempt to only publish articles that pass some fact verification by the editors . 
  they also appear to be impartial pretty much all the way , which is rare for newspapers nowadays . 
  i already explained to you why i believe they refuse to talk . 
  i even gave you an example from the same conflict when the other side refused to talk in a similar situation . 
  if this is how you read my comments and are pulling me into a daft converstation then i think i 'll be out of it from here . 
  have a nice evening . 
  so you 're fine with killing them without even attempting to make a serious offer ? 
  please forgive me if i refuse to take such a fatalistic standpoint . 
   current president already made offers such as pardon of those people that joined army but had n't kill anyone . 
  that 's not an offer . 
  that is asking them to give up their protests and accept getting fucked . 
  you know , they did n't start to revolt out of boredom . 
  they object the way the yatzenuk government came to power and they disagree with the yatzenuk governments intentions to join eu + nato as well as cutting off ukraine from russia . 
  giving them vague promises about no criminal charges is not a serious offer of dialog . 
  yanukovich asked the same of the maidan protests and they rejected it not surprisingly . 
  but when yanukovich made that offer nobody here was writing `` hey he made an offer , he really wants peaceful solution '' ... 
  you may want to read up about tactical nuclear weapons . 
  their whole purpose is to make up any shortcomings in conventional warfare . 
  nato has them too and nato will use them the same way . 
  it is part of mad . 
  you know they have it and you know they will use it if you force them . 
  so if you attack them and beat them conventionally they will use nukes and in the end everyone is dead . 
   russian culture is more open for violence , they see it as a viable tool to reach their goals . 
  what ? 
  i do n't hear any news of russians doing airstrikes against crowded cities . 
  i think you need to drop this kind of loaded thinking .
