  i use my elbows, 
  i think if you look at the numbers you 'll find that croatians in average are better off when it comes to most metrics . 
   all of their economies are worse now than in 1991 , the height of all the bullshit before yugo 's dissolution . 
  except for slovenia and croatia . 
  tbh i always pee in the sink so i wash my hands automatically anyway . 
  there are way less bacterias on a dick than on a hand . 
  your hand is touching stuff all the time . 
  you aren ot touching my dick , you are touching my hand, 
  so what ? 
  it 's not like it makes you sick and you will never know anyway . 
  why do you need to wash your hands with soap after pissing ? 
  i dont always wash my hands after pissing . 
  why ? 
  i just touched my own dick . 
  i find asian chicks hot . 
  brexit was predicted to be a tight race with 47 - 49 % in the polls . 
  le penn is 70 vs 30 %, 
  50 years are a long time my friend . 
  50 years ago europe was devided by a mined border with guards ready to shot everyone crossing and both sides threatening each other with nuclear annilation . 
  another 25 years and germany was about to put millions in the oven and attacked the entire world, 
  good maybe some day there will be place for some semi decent national parks, 
  as long as 51 % of the french hate her guts , she wo n't become president . 
  her heart will go on, 
  how does one exclude the other ? 
  india has reputation as a giant powerhouse of intellectual achievement ? 
  since when ? 
  indians working in the west have the reputation for being tech savvy , career driven and with a high empathize on knowledge . 
  oh buddy stuff can get so much worse . 
  we have n't even entered the shaddy parts of the town , globally speaking . 
  why is lithuania always so positive ? 
  the always come out liking everybody and have an optimistic outlook on the future in those kind of surveys . 
  is it because all the pessimistic people kill themselves ? 
  if france leaves , the eu stops existing . 
  i will do this when i am wrong , sure . 
  do yourself a favour ; write down your political opinion and prediction for the next three years on a peace of paper . 
  store that paper somewhere safe and make yourself a reminder on google . 
  in three years read the peace of paper again and see how wrong / right you were . 
  then go out and observe how fucked the uk with its new economy is . 
  given that you are the one who is going to be fucked over by brexxit , i ai n't that so sure . 
  lol, 
  i said that merkel did not cause the refugee crisis which op blamed her for, 
  well in case it 's probably for the best for the uk to leave so the countries who really want to be in union can concentrate on solving the problem without the uk blocking everything and whining all the time . 
  you responded to my question of what merkel has to do with brexit with  inviting a million + migrants into germany in the year the uk had the referendum ? 
  which , to repeat myself , is wrong notion of what happened . 
  merkel did not cause the refugee crisis . 
  they refugees were already in europe or on their way . 
  not to mention that it is beyond me why the uk left because of refugees , ** they did n't take in anyway **, 
  moving the goal post i see . 
  the false narrative is that merkel caused the refugee crisis . 
  i have n't said they eu does not have problem . 
  i simply stated , factually correct , that merkel did not cause the refugee crisis . 
  the uk is leaving because it does not share the same european vision like other european members and , actually , me and many other europeans support the uk leaving . 
   they are better yes , but britain is a sovereign country and they have the right to decide who goes in and out of the country , not the german government . 
  again , the uk did n't take any refugees they did n't want to . 
  he was downvoted for pushing a false narrative . 
  the refugee crisis started long before merkels ` invitation ' . 
  not to mention that no refugees made it to the uk anyway . 
  repeating the same old wrong trueism does n't make it true . 
  the ** refugees ** were already coming . 
  merkel did n't cause the refugee crisis . 
  she gave her infamous ` invintation ' in the end of august when there were already hundreds of thousand on the balkan rote . 
   there was also the paris terror attack which , again , were not commited by refugees but people from belgium  also not true , one of the main organizers of the paris terror attack was an isis member who came to france during the migrant crisis . 
  [ wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdelhamid_abaaoud ) . 
  he was born in bruessels . 
   also yes i am in serbia and no i do n't plan to live in germany . 
  why would i ? 
  i did n't ask if you were planning on living germany but if you are planning to live outside of serbia . 
  are you ? 
  do you ? 
  on a sidenote there 's a a big difference between serbs who legally come to germany with passports and are more than willing to work from day 1 and also go to german language courses before to prepare and syrian `` refugees '' . 
  wait , you believe economic migrants are better than genuine war refugees ? 
  cause let me tell you , brexit was fuelled massively by the british dislike of eastern european migrants not a few refugees . 
  what terror attacks are you talking about ? 
  charlie hebdo was the only major terror attack committed before brexit and it was committed by people with belgium and french citizenship and and not refugees . 
  also most of people came from syria and thus are refugees and not migrants . 
  there is a difference . 
  can i ask you , do you in serbia and do you plan to never work abroad ? 
  just asking because most serbs i know who are complaining about migrants are often migrants themselves . 
  it 's not merkel . 
  almost all countries of the eu does n't want the eu the british would stay in . 
  i mean half the union wants a fiscal union and merkel is keeping them back ffs . 
  but the uk did not accept quotas and their borders are closed ? 
  less than 20.000 refugees went to the uk . 
  what open border policy you are talking about ? 
  freedom of movement ? 
  that 's not merkels ideal , that is one of the core principles of the eu . 
  also you do realize that without merkel there would have been hundreds of thousands stuck in serbia , right ? 
  which of merkels failed policies you are talking about ? 
  are n't you a nice person, 
  if you think macrons economical ideas come even close to those of fillon you are vastly uninformed . 
  macron is like castro compared to fillon when it comes to the economy, 
  what has merkel to do with brexit ? 
  brexiters wanted to leave the union for the last three decades . 
  your graph shows terror attack not victims . 
  the left mostly attacks infrastructure . 
   as for far right , we have the murder of mp jo cox and breivik for starters , but there have been others since if i recall . 
  we have plenty of more like the grenade attack in belgium , the serial killers in germany , the shooting spree in germany , attack on jews in france and a few more, 
  source ? 
  at least in europe in the last two decades far rights terrorists have killed more people than far left terrorists . 
  i 'd even argue that right wing terrorists killed more than left wing and islamist in the history of post war europe .
