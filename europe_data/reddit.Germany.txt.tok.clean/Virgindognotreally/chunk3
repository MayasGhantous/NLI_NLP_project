  there is no legal way they can return them if the death penalty is on the table . 
  however , since there is no death penalty yet who knows what they will do, 
  the leaders of the groundforce and airforce are reported to have been killed : https://twitter.com/skynewsarabia_b/status/754069701827919872  claims from turkish sources on air that head of turkish military has been killed and that the heads of the turkish air force and land forces are behind the coup . 
  [ shootings on the streets now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhvvnzqsye ), 
  yeah i meant article 7 and legally it is theoretically possible to go this way and merkel and hollande already have signalized that they think this referendum is binding . 
  as merkel and hollande already said there is no coming back and the eu could always trigger article 14 and boot the uk out for being undemocratic . 
  i really hope the eu wo n't allow a second referendum . 
  the uk must go now otherwise it will be a blockade and a drag on real progress forever, 
  you are right , i got the numbers mixed up . 
  still a 3 % drop in grow is anything but shallow, 
   the economy will be fine - they predict that if there is a recession it 'll only be shallow and they have plenty of tools to dampen it . 
  what you should really be scared of is the growing mess within the eu . 
  lol , the u.k. economy was predicted to grow by 2.8 % and has corrected his forecast to -1 % after the referendum , which is anything but `` shallow '' . 
  hahaha oh / u/miliz keep wiggling . 
  i 'll repeat it again ; miliz pretended to have read the study . 
  when he was called out on it , he denied it and claimed he had read the study , when proven wrong he went back and edited his comment to make it seem like he only confused the two terms , but he got caught doing that too . 
  so suma sumarum , he ( and by that i mean you ) is a dirty little liar . 
  ah come on / u/miliz , you got caught lying and now you are making it worse . 
  it was never about you confusing the terms , you got caught lying about having read the study and the you edited the comments to make it match your story , which is the biggest admission of guilt one can imagine , but because you were too stupid to even do that , you got caught doing that too and now you are having this scharade with your puppy account ( which not polish as well and sounds like you but by chance posts almost only in topics / u/miliz posst too ) making this entire thing even more pathetic . 
  i do not have to have a response buddy . 
  i am not the one he was arguing with . 
  birdlover gave him a study which / u/miliz did not read and then he lied about reading it , making up content of the study and only when called out later , he started to read the study . 
  he then went on to edit a previous comment , making it look like he said something completely different and then i caught him lying about that , as he forgot to edit his other comment . 
  i am not arguing about whether / u/miliz or birdlover is right or wrong , because frankly i know fuck all about the topic , i am just stating that / u/miliz lied through his teeth when he claimed to have read the study and that he got caught doing so . 
  so yeah he / you ( i suspect it 's you because your writting style is very similiar to / u/miliz ) is a proven liar . 
  i see you used your second account to answer . 
  it was pretty obvious before the edit that he was lying since he / you went into specifics about vegetarians and vegans and ranted about how vegans needed diet suppliements when the study was about vegetarians and mentioned the use of eggs and diary . 
  oh and i like bacon , but i do n't like liars, 
  here we got again, 
  do n't bother responding to this guy . 
  he is a [ busted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qq6ig/meatfree_days_soaring_in_swedish_schools/d4v5my0 ) liar, 
  do n't bother responding to this guy .

  * everybody in the western world an some of the developing world that is not starving . 
  i read your comments before and hahahahaha you edited it . 
  dude , you are even more pathetic than i thought . 
  edit : but hey you forgot to edit the other comment  these studies compare vegans , who spend a lot of time managing their diets and are generally food-conscious , with ordinary meat-eaters , who have no idea about balanced meals . 
  pretty biased , also considering all vegans must eat animal-derived vitamins and minerals , which simply do n't exist in animals ( b12 or heme iron ) . 
   these studies compare vegans  vegans busted and rekt . 
  source : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qq6ig/meatfree_days_soaring_in_swedish_schools/d4v4v4c, 
  well , yeah , you read it now . 
  does not really change the fact that you did not read it before and got caught red handed and then tried to come up with some bullshit excuse how you did not know the difference between a vegan and a vegetarian and then got busted lying again . 
  that 's were you got reked . 
  basically it shows that you have zero interested in examining the studies and you will ad-hoc reason everything to fit your bias . 
  1 kg of frozen beans at a lidle in warsaw are 2 $ . 
  1 kg of the cheapest meat is 5 $ 500 gramm of tofu at lidle in warsaw is 2 $ 500 gramm of the cheapest meat is 2.60 $, 
  you got rekt when you got caught that you did not even read the source which was offered . 
  sweden does not have an exceptionally high rate of vegetarians for europe . 
  it 's comperable to germany ( 8.6 % ) , italy ( 7.8 % ) or austria ( 8.9 % ) . 
  generally throughout all of europe vegetarianism and veganism is on the rise both among the youth and the general population . 
  give it up , you got caught and rekt . 
  according to this survey the number of vegetarians in sweden increased from 3 % to 10 % since 2001 so it seems like its becoming more popular in the population . 
  in the 15 - 24 age group it 's even close to 20 % . 
  germany opened the borders of the balkan countries and greece ? 
  well - we do n't really have those crisis on the continent , so we do n't have to deal with in light speed in the first place, 
  you are wrong . 
  gove wanted to back boris but boris has disappeared since friday and because gove thought a leaver should throw his hat in the ring he did . 
  gove tried to reach boris until this moring but could n't . 
  not sure cameron really gives much of a shit about his party anymore . 
  merkel will never allow it . 
  she let in 1 million refugees instead of sacrificing freedom of movement . 
  it 's worse though if you combine them too, 
  yeah , that 's why saudi tourists are really popular . 
  in my experience german are among the most liked people worldwide . 
  well she is a german born woman from the 40 - 50s , so chances are high she is . 
  almost all tabloids and most bought newspaper are pushing leave, 
  on the other hand you got the entire murdoch media propaganding for leave . 
  of course mate , fuck the unity of the european union if i can get some sweet discount on the phone wanted to buy . 
  cigarettes are cheaper than the neighbouring countries,

  well ... now i kinda hope you leave, 
  thank you , that was quite informative . 
  i am 90 % 12 hours a day / 7 days a week is illegal in all european countries . 
  child marriages are not exactly uncommon too yet they are still pretty horrible . 
  12 hoursa a day / 7 days a week is pretty horrible . 
  how about everybody pays for his own pension . 
  in all fairness huge apartment blocks come with their very own set of problems hence why cities stopped building them, 
  germans work the fewest hours of all europeans though . 
  with the exception of france people in all countries work more hours than the germans, 
  do we really want to have more people in europe ? 
  it 's already crowded as it is . 
  nrw is not 50 % mountains like austria . 
   ok . just send me some of your hot british women  send me some of your hot british women  of your hot british women  hot british women  ** hot british women **, 
  na , both have the same . 
  people do n't like skyscapers . 
  there is a housing crisis in all european big cities and none of them is building skyscrapers . 
  people also overestimate how much your metabolism slows down . 
  you probably should not base your vote on anything anybody says on the internet . 
  [ evidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_european_union ), 
  i am sure op will deliver . 
  is it really a problem anywhere ? 
  i live in berlin , germany in a part of town with a lot of muslim and i see maybe a handful burqa ladies . 
  the majority of women wear nothing and a few more wear hijabs . 
  so you drink like 3 beers the entire night and do n't pay entry ? 
  well obviously they did not have the power to vote . 
  did you just compare women to children ?
