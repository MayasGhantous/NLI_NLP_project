  great to hear !, 
  you are not working in field related to space exploration now by chance ? 
  what did you study in darmstadt ? 
  i got my dipl . 
  in civil engineering at tu darmstadt in 2006 .

  his advisors are probably the guys from the nobel peace prize committee in 2009 . 
  this medallion is given to people the pope hopes to become angels of peace . 
  [ palestinian president mahmoud abbas also got one recently ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32782440 ) . 
  just goes to show that idiocy knows neither gender nor race . 
  you ca n't help who you are attracted to . 
  so as long as it 's consensual you should have the right to pursue happiness any way you want . 
  computational engineer here . 
  i made a few structural mechanical calculations on the smallest mirror ( see ' spiegel e ' [ here ] ( https://thisisillustrious.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/european-extremely-large-telescope-e-elt/ ) ) a few years ago . 
  it 's nice to see the telescope being built as the other , even bigger telescope ( owl ) for which we also did some preliminary studies was cancelled . 
  do n't get me started on them . 
  those fuckers of bild have really gone out of their way to poison the relations to greece and are doing a mighty fine job to reinforce prejudice . 
  i even sympathize with regulating out-of-control free markets but not with the violent methods used by some idiots . 
  you on the other hand , by not being able to differentiate between opponents of violence and ` capitalist extremists ' , have clearly shown who 's brain badly needs a reality check . 
  edit : spelling, 
  [ karl-heiz kurras ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl-heinz_kurras ) , the policeman that killed ohnesorg was tried ( but not for murder ) and acquitted . 
  circumstances are indeed very dubious but the should not be taken as justification for violence now . 
  you are really arguing for terrorism ? 
  i suppose just the right kind , not the islamic or right-wing terrorism , surely . 
  you would n't want them killing people , right ? 
  just those with noble causes . 
  sorry , i have to leave my desk , our sarcasm-detector just exploded . 
  the pegida rallys and the [ montagsdemos 25 years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monday_demonstrations_in_east_germany ) have shown that regular protest will be covered by the media at some point . 
  and large peaceful rallies almost always get coverage here . 
  edit : and the argument that violence as a mean to get attention is a useful tool could be extended to terrorism as well . 
  the sad thing is no matter how justified protest over the ecb may be , the violence that is happening right now will be the only thing that will be remembered in the public eye . 
  those police cars are parked quite aggressively . 
  clearly their fault . 
  but police would never put something in their reports that blows things out of proportions , would they ? 
  oh wait , there are reports coming out now that the [ mob of 30 migrants that allegedly chased three girls in a mall and took photos of them were in fact just two guys and there were no photos or videos of the girls on bystander 's mobile devices ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/sophienhof-kiel-polizei-revidiert-angaben-zu-belaestigung-durch-migranten-1.2938261 ) . 
  or did you mean merkel 's saying ? 
  i wish she would do that to seehofer ( who i personally trust as far as i could throw him ) . 
  they rebroadcasted the song with turkish subtitles in this weeks show . 
  can confirm , i 'm insane . 
  hey , do n't drag my name into that . 
  i did not have a sexual relation with that man ... mr. erdogan . 
  must have really hit a nerve if he tries to stop that . 
  and i would really like to know what the ambassador though of it . 
  yeah , and by adding * / s * you were claiming your doubts whether they would be revealed soon hinting at the notion that the police will suppress this as long as they can . 
  you were ridiculed ( and probably downvoted ) for this as the information was in fact released very quickly . 
  well you do have to admit that your implied accusations have turned out to be wrong and you were rightfully called out for that . 
  no need to bring up any kind of phobia . 
  no , i did n't get the impression that you thought it was an immigrant involved in this . 
  i called you out for assuming the police are holding information back without due reason ( like ongoing investigations ) . 
  how did you even draw that conclusion from my comment ? 
  also i did n't downvote you . 
  edit : not immediately releasing names has been standard procedure for police in germany since as long as i can remember . 
  there would be ways to get rid of assad and leave no power vacuum * if * the us and russia would only cooperate . 
  sadly they both put their own interests over compromise . 
  if you really see this as a necessary evil you are putting yourself outside the [ geneva convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geneva_conventions ) . 
  i know bad things happen in war but you do n't have to excuse them . 
  also you somehow missed the part where it says `` now they were torturing to kill '' . 
  the torture for information even happened before the uprising which was during times of peace . 
  also you missed the part talking about civilian victims , not enemy soldiers . 
  grow up yourself if you think it is right to play with peoples lives like that just because `` that 's the way the world is '' . 
  you are excusing torture and murder here . 
  something like this is never ok . 
  paranoid much ? 
  aw poor guy , he should be given the bloody nobel peace prize then for doing so well and as compensation for having to resort to torturing his own people to death . 
   i had never seen anything like it . 
  before the uprising , the regime tortured prisoners to get information ; now they were torturing to kill . 
  i saw marks left by burning candles , and once the round mark of a stove -- the sort you use to heat tea -- that had burned someone 's face and hair . 
  some people had deep cuts , some had their eyes gouged out , their teeth broken , you could see traces of lashes with those cables you use to start cars . 
  there were wounds full of pus , as if they 'd been left untreated for a long time and had got infected . 
  sometimes the bodies were covered with blood that looked fresh . 
  it was clear they had died very recently . 
  so the enemy of my enemy is my friend then ? 
  i think the problems with refugees is by far smaller than the threat to peace and democracy by people like the fn , ukip and the afd . 
  they are disturbing the peace by spreading fud . 
  what about all the attacks on refugee homes by right-wingers that got encouraged by them ? 
  is that not a problem to you ? 
  [ just a peaceful dictator doing his job , right ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/they-were-torturing-to-kill-inside-syrias-death-machine-caesar ), 
  and a guy that helped [ launder billions of dollars of drug money ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs ) could be one of the managers of your bank . 
  it 's even possible that [ your doctor might have been a war criminal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radovan_karad\u017ei\u0107#fugitive ) . 
  we 've got enough bad apples of our own already in the barrel though so that saying is pretty useless . 
  i love it but secretly wish it was in better shape . 
  it 's really like this big family where the members started bickering and tension is growing . 
  we really need to talk to find the common ground we stand on and regain trust that we share the same core values . 
  no need to worry . 
  op was misinformed . 
  as a austro-german with both citizenships i can firmly attest that this is not true . 
  [ see here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_nationality_law#dual_citizenship ) . 
  i love the eu but am voting for a party strongly against it ? 
  something does n't seem right here . 
   i 'm glad the afd i 'd getting traction and i 'm voting fn in the next election . 
  the afd is a nationalist-conservationist movement . 
  there 's hardly anything liberal about them . 
  they oppose gay marriage and `` alternative lifestyles '' and advocate strengthening the `` traditional core family '' . 
  nice catch . 
  too bad , they did n't find this guy earlier . 
  but it goes to show that we need more cooperation between law enforcement in the eu .
