  `` he once fought a shark .

  `` oh no , my arm 's come off '' bloody brilliant !, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://youtu.be/6nwxsqeepxy ), 
  [ this source ] ( http://www.frauennotrufe.at/cms/images/stories/zahlendatenfaktenzusexuellergewaltseptember2014.pdf ) says 31 % family , 39 % acquaintances , 18 % chance acquaintanceship ( whatever the difference is ) and just 12 % strangers of all reported rape cases in 2010 ( page 6 ) . 
  ah , i see you have opted for the simple explanation omitting even the higher awareness and level of reporting following the new years eve events . 
  also the article unfortunately does not mention by what margin these incidents are an increase and the numbers of past years . 
  it could well be that even the numbers of reported domestic abuse was on the rise but without numbers from the past there 's no way of telling . 
  but you can always go the easy way instead of thinking criticaly . 
  ca n't really compare these numbers as the degree of acquaintance is not stated on ops report . 
  also if the numbers are the same worldwide ( ca n't check right now ) it would just go to show that 's it is not a matter of morals , religion or society . 
  i doubt however that there is no variation . 
  unfortunately he missed his train unlike [ this guy ] ( http://images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/12791.jpg ) ( no funny caption though ) . 
  sorry to hear you had such bad experiences . 
  as a father of two daughters i really hope that we as a whole society can raise the awareness of sexual abuse and stop victim blaming . 
  but the right of sexual self determination should be universal and not just cited when going against a subset of ethnic groups . 
  anyone praising our `` western values '' seems like a bigot when looking at the statistics of sexual abuse over the last decades . 
  no one is excused from sexual abuse be that in a relationship or not , stranger , family , friend or acquaintance . 
  it 's not ok anywhere against anyone and no one should use boys will be boys ( or men will be men ) as a defense ever . 
  i 'd love to hear your theory . 
  i sure hope you got something on the estimated numbers of unreported cases , the degree of familiarity of the alleged perpetrators to the victims ( or absence of it ) , the crime rate in europe in the last 10 to 20 years , the crime rate among immigrants in comparison to that , some statistics of age and gender distribution of sexual offenders and such . 
  maybe you can even shine some light on morals in theory and practice in different societies ? 
  sad to see this gets downvoted . 
  obviously people want an easy scape goat and not look at their `` good old society '' . 
  [ about 80 % of reported sexual abuse in 2012 to 2014 in austria was carried out by men known to the victim ( see pages 2 and 3 ) ] ( http://www.frauennotrufe.at/cms/images/stories/zahlendatenfaktenzusexuellergewaltseptember2014.pdf ) ( by friends , family , neighbors , acquaintances ) . 
  unfortunately no one seems to want to discuss these figures because they do n't fit the assumption of moral superiority . 
  are people really that oblivious or are they just being racist ? 
  there seems to be quite conflicting versions of what is representative of the general opinion . 
  it is much to diverse for one group to claim that they speak for the people . 
  has been heavily abused but it would be stupid to call those shouting it not part of the people . 
  strangely the fear of social backlash does n't seem to bother the more radical people in social media . 
  some subreddits and facebook groups have become quite toxic because of that and you have to fight hard to keep discussions civil . 
  but if the moderates do n't try they will be partly at fault for the radicalization on both sides . 
  are you seriously comparing nazi fascism with institutionalized death camps to a religion ? 
  there are people who can differentiate but they sadly are not the vocal majority here . 
  also now you can claim to have seen at least one . 
  well what do you expect when there 's not enough postage on the pig ? 
  if you are afraid of causing offense by your words then it is better by anonymous action ? 
  i highly doubt moderate critics do get flak for voicing their opinion . 
  disagreement or opposition perhaps but if you ca n't cope with that i 'm afraid that you wo n't get too far in life anyway . 
  except if it were a vegan virgin . 
  if by sane you mean people blaming the whole of a group on the actions of a few then we 'd need to argue about your definition of sane . 
  no , because if that were just the case you would n't like immigration but stay impartial towards immigrants . 
  edit : grammar, 
  depends on whether you do n't like immigrants as a whole or individuals of that group . 
  you might have a valid reason for the latter but are at least prejudiced , if not a xenophobe , if it is the former . 
   both views are abhorrent but one is not the same as the other . 
  you might think how advanced we are in our values . 
  but for example our societies not long ago were debating whether sexual abuse in a marriage should be punishable at all . 
  in germany it was only criminalized [ nine years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marital_rape#legal_changes ) with other countries not that much earlier . 
  so i really do n't think we should be pointing fingers just because we have progressed a little recently . 
  and what constitutes `` immoral dressing '' and therefore `` asking for it '' seems to be just varying degrees of clothing . 
  so while i agree that we are talking about differences in cultural view in general i do n't think that they are so far off that the gap can not be bridged . 
  of course it wo n't happen if you do n't put any effort into it or look away and pretend there are no problems . 
  but demonizing one culture and generalizing does n't do justice to the varying kind of people seeking asylum here . 
  there are different reasons for it ( war , economics , presecution ) , different backgrounds ( educated , non-educated , religious fanatics , moderates ) and type of people ( unaccompanied youths , families , singles ) . 
  i 'm afraid that by grouping them all into one will lead to segregation , weakening of the moderate views and eventually to bigger conflicts . 
  this by the way is exactly what the [ daesh want ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/ ) and i really do n't think this is the way we should counter that . 
  i guess we just leave it at disagreeing on the issue whether young male asylum seekers can be integrated and whether this issue is part of a main stream culture as you call it . 
  it is always looking away that enables and enforces the perpetrators and * that * should be the main focus in my opinion no matter the background . 
   i never heard men say girls deserved to be raped for when they go out with their hair uncovered seems like [ you have not been listening enough then ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hayley-rose-horzepa/victim-blaming_b_847310.html ) . 
  there are many cases like this in europe and the us . 
  and please get your fucking head around the fact that sexual abuse in europe is not an isolated instance just because it is n't happening in the open . 
  [ 23000 cases of child abuse in the uk in one year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/child_sexual_abuse_in_the_united_kingdom ) !, 
  something our fucking fine culture can be proud of , i 'm sure . 
  but i guess you 'll find a way to blame that on bloody foreigners as well . 
  i think we both agree that sexual abuse is an abhorrent crime and one should n't give the impression that behavior like this is tolerable . 
  what i disagree however is that it is ingrained in `` their '' culture as in contrast to `` ours '' . 
  while it might be true that on a whole the objectification of women is worse in other countries ( india might serve as an example as well here ) it is still a global phenomenon . 
  that is why i do n't see it as a `` us '' versus `` them '' thing but more of a `` do n't be a dick where ever you are from '' situation . 
  and europe had it 's share of abuse of children in the recent past . 
  there are enough scandals in the catholic church or children 's homes in the last few decades to make you sick . 
  i would n't however go so far to call that a cultural problem also . 
  i have n't heard of taharrush gamea besides from egypt and that started barely five years ago . 
  hardly something i would call a part of `` many islamic cultures '' . 
  and what is it with `` cultures , specifically the ones attempting to use the refugee crisis to enter into europe '' ? 
  do you have any sources for that statement ? 
  and the notion that sexual assault is a culturally accepted in islamic countries just because they happen more often there is as stupid as saying shootings in the us are culturally accepted because they mostly happen there ( here i go making stupid analogies again , but i hope you can see the point this time ) . 
  if i understand you correctly you state : a ) sexual assault is part of middle eastern culture . 
  b ) sexual abuse during or after war is ok . 
  i ca n't say i share either of your point if views . 
  edit : i 'd preferred it if you 'd let the personal attacks be . 
  it does n't help your point really . 
  i wanted to make sure you 'd feel comfortable with me . 
  while i would argue that the western values are in doubt too if you look into the attacks by christians but i 'll have to concede that the numbers seem to support the statement that attacks with islamic background have been on the rise . 
  and i see that it 's hard to counter extremism without some serious effort . 
  i 'm neither ok with `` white persons only '' or `` black persons only '' or `` whatever group only '' . 
  safe spaces need not to be off-limits for men but just monitored more . 
  and that is [ just what they did ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/sicherheitskonzept-koelner-karneval-koeln-will-an-karneval-security-point-fuer-frauen-einrichten-1.2834765 ) ( more safety personal , darker zones better iluminated ) . 
  that 's quite contrary to what you think happened . 
  actually i was just showing how ridiculous it is to hold the actions of a small part of a group of people against the entirety of them . 
  do n't know how this makes me either racist or naive . 
  i do n't think that safe-zones classify all men as potential sexual offenders . 
  and during carnival there have been a [ number of reports of sexual assaults in cologne ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12151893/cologne-carnival-sex-assault-reports-quadruple-on-last-year.html ) . 
  some of those are attributed to the higher willingness to report such things due to the nye events . 
  so those safe-zones were more of a `` look-we-are-doing-something '' thing because how can you really expect to keep everything under control during that time without canceling the party . 
  do you really think that the abuses on nye was organized by `` the migrants '' ? 
  you have n't been really following the history of germany , have you ? 
  last time mass raping occurred in germany was [ after world war ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_during_the_occupation_of_germany ) by people of the soviet union , us , united kingdom and france . 
  would you call all members of the various armies scum because of that ?
