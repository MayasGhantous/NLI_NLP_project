  no , because that would be ridiculous , right ? 
  oh , and the last time german scum organized themselves into mobs by the hundreds to threaten refugees ( no molestation or stealing though ) was [ just recently ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/mob-chanting-bus-refugees-germany-politicians ) . 
  in before someone else says `` now kith '' . 
  * fistbumps *, 
  no , i did n't mean that . 
  i said the reason why something terrible has n't happened is because luckily the nye event * was n't * blamed on refugees as a whole . 
  it also was n't blamed on all men either as far as i know . 
  edit : that would indeed be moronic if it were the case , so i 'd agree on that part of what you were saying . 
  he has a point though by saying that almost no one would call responsible actions by politicians or the police racist . 
  would you please chose one corner and stay in there ? 
  it 's very hard bashing people who have differentiated opinions . 
  * wondering if i really need to put the / s at the end but then remembering that irony and internet do n't mix very well * / s, 
  could you please state your sources because i was n't able to find the number of foreign nationals by age bracket neither [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany ) nor [ here ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/societystate/population/population.html ) . 
  you mean easily blamed on those who did it instead of a whole group of people just because they have the same place of origin , right ? 
  because that 's what has happened . 
  probably referring to [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3230670/housed-refugees-fled-europe-better-life-living-former-nazi-barracks.html ) article by the daily mail which is [ pretty much made up . 
  ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/1.675967 ), 
  of course they are not housed in the sites of the death camps . 
  i was just looking into buchenwald when i found out why you were bringing that up . 
  [ here 's the huffington post article ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2015/09/16/international-presse-fluechtlinge-buchenwald_n_8144328.html ) ( german ) debunking a daily mail article concerning this . 
  fuck daily mail !, 
  edit : [ buzzfeed article in english ] ( http://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/buchenwald-refugee-story-debunk#.ayqoodvnx ), 
  no it is n't . 
  they are spread around the country . 
  and how much has the violence increased by then ? 
  i have n't heard anything besides san bernadino and the the constant number of school shootings . 
  what have `` the migrants '' ( as if they were one entity ) pulled off so far ? 
  there 's a big scare going around when in reality they are just normal people with the same ratio of scum as in the rest of the population . 
  * a * refugee center ? 
  [ there have been almost 70 arson attacks on refugee shelters this year alone . 
  please enlighten us with your statistics on the massive rise in sexual crimes by refugees . 
  and / u/fitpantsonymonkey _ [ has a point there ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/09/crime-germany ) . 
  intimidation at it 's best is when you are cited to police headquarters , kept waiting for hours , being questioned without even knowing why and be told that you 'd better keep in line because what would happen to your kids if they would have to take them away . 
  oh and you should report if anything suspicious is going on and you 'd better report it 'cause they have more informants . 
  happened all over eastern europe 30 years ago and we are luckily far from that . 
  ok , i bite : how many incidents have made the headlines besides the events in cologne ? 
  please state your sources instead of just claiming daily occurrences . 
  i could point out that it is certainly not the majority misbehaving , that entitlement is something that can relatively easily be dealt with , that backward ideas are not a exclusive to muslims ( take russia as an example for gay rights ) and that you should n't just go ahead and punish a big group of people for the actions of a few . 
  i do n't know if any of those arguments will cause a change of heart . 
  however i would like to adress two other aspects where i think you are wrong : [ you ca n't send the refugees back to a warzone and we are indeed obligated to help them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugee_law ) . 
  ok , so you take * one * account and take the 90 % figure for granted and equate `` unpleasant '' to daily rape and assault ? 
  yes , the number of balkan refugees was smaller than syrians but as long as the war is going on you ca n't send them back . 
  do n't know what this has to do with africa , though . 
  in my experience only generalizing or racist comments got the `` evil nazi '' treatment ( they deserved ) . 
  differentiated opinions were always fine ( at least in my book ) . 
  have you ( or anyone you know ) experienced unjust branding ? 
  i 'm certainly not at loss for words here . 
  but i did n't want to waste my and your time after your initial statement . 
  you * could * say i was tired of some shit as well . 
   if you are up for debate i 'd be happy to expand my point . 
  also i would n't want to attack your character as i do n't know you at all . 
  could you perhaps please explain why you think throwing out the refugees will help and where to you would deport them ? 
  also i would like to know if you have any personal experience with refugees . 
   ** forever ** seriously ? 
  syria is down to about 18m people already . 
  will they be all gone in six years ? 
  who will be replacing them afterwards ? 
  not to waste a chance to make a real argument : the importance of pacifying syria is of course high . 
  if you look at the number of the refugees of the balkan war during the 90s the majority ( over 90 % ) has been [ sent back in the years after ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/ds27_2_d.htm ) . 
  i expect it to be the same with this conflict . 
  of course i would n't be comfortable with that . 
  it just is n't happening !, 
  ( of course i 'm not denying that there have been rapes . 
  but there is no discernible increase in rape cases or other criminal activity happening if you take a look at the statistics over the last years ) . 
  no one is claiming all refugees are good people . 
  but the proportion of scum in refugees is about the same as in the native population . 
  no surprises there . 
  it does n't have to be fake . 
  you should take it for what it * is * : the statement of * one * woman working at an arrival center . 
  it is highly anecdotal and does n't have to be representative but it * is * her experience . 
  disregarding it as fake just out of a feeling is just water on the mills of those who think they are being repressed . 
  now that 's a demand i could rally behind . 
  ban all indecent people !, 
  not to worry . 
  the [ proportion of native trash is about the same ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-11/bundeskriminalamt-fluechtlinge-deutsche-straftaten-vergleich ) . 
  seems like we got enough * civilized * racist fanatics ` round here so we thought we 'd invite some uncivilized as well . 
  sorry , was this not the answer you were looking for ? 
  where to ? 
  simple solutions for simple minds , eh ? 
  like `` burn the witch ! '', 
  and `` hang the communists ! '', 
  so where is the majority of germans protesting the [ rising attacks on refugees ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/refugees-targeted-in-violent-attacks-across-germany/a-18820330 ) ? 
  surely they will stand up against the bad , indecent minority . 
  i mean how hard * could * it be to slap those idiots around when we see them misbehaving ... or [ spreading hate speech ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/outrage-over-concentration-camp-quip-at-pegida-speech/a-18793051 ) ? 
  now i 'm also confused . 
  yeah , culture is definitely the problem . 
  would n't happen in [ the `` west '' with our moral standards ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/24/rape-sexual-assault-ban-frats ) . 
  who are `` all those '' ? 
  could you be making the same mistake as you claim they are when you use `` all '' ? 
  or are you just crying '' [ help !, 
  i 'm being repressed . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/jvkiwjnepny?t=2m25s ) '' ? 
  i would n't call 18k deportations in 2015 `` nearly non existant '' . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germans-ask-if-country-is-still-safe-after-cologne-attacks-a-1073165.html#ref=nl-international ) ), 
  that 's a pretty extensive article which not only highlights some of the problems we are currently facing but is also showing quite the opposite of the alleged suppression of the media . 
  [ behold the beautiful currywurst ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/currywurst ) . 
  i know . 
  that 's why hitler got rid of them when they were not longer useful . 
   re-introduce the good old civilian riot squads . 
  you might as well go all out and praise the sa while you are going so stronk .
