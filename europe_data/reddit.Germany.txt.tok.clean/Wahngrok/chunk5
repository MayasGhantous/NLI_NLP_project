  there still are refugee camps in north africa but people are fleeing them because they are a shithole . 
  [ still the european comission has been trying to establish a system like this already ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/european-commission-third-country-immigrant-processing-centres ), 
   go for the australian solution . 
  australia has the `` easy '' option because it 's a bloody island . 
  wo n't work for europe though . 
  well there * are * some things to consider like will they be accepted where you send them back ( you ca n't just dump them if the other country wo n't take them ) , where to send them to anyway if their origin is unclear etc. 
  a party that claims to have a simple solution is simply lying .

  hofer will still be portrayed as the victim by the fp\u00d6 which will probably serve them to mobilize their voters . 
  i 'm afraid that this might work better than for van der bellen . 
  ca n't really see that they will get free movement with the level of shit going on at the moment . 
  [ visa free travel for turks to the eu has been on the brink for at least a month ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/erdogan-turkey-not-alter-anti-terror-laws-visa-free-travel-eu ) and will probably never happen since they have n't met all conditions yet . 
  i was going to say that this is pretty similar to puritan america . 
  yes . 
  they could just acknowledge what happened a hundred years ago but instead opted to feel insulted . 
  what law are you talking about ? 
  there are no direct consequences of passing a resolution . 
  it 's just a statement as in `` we , the german parliament , recognize the events that happened in the ottoman empire during the time of 1915 to 1918 as a genocide against the armenian population . 
  we also recognize the failure of the then allied germany to intervene and see it as our obligation to help turkey and armenia to overcome their differences . '', 
  ( my words , [ full text here ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-armenien-resolution-im-wortlaut-a-1095397.html ) . 
  it 's not even a law that was passed , just a resolution . 
  but the number of attendees was also higher with about 400k . 
  the festival was in the middle of darmstadt . 
  you would have had a hard time trying to avoid it if you went downtown . 
  they were actually quite heavy on security and police forces even . 
  but you can not control everything in a crowd unfortunately . 
  actually it is placed * around * the moat not * in * it . 
  also it 's right in the city center as it was a [ ducal palace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/darmstadt#castles_and_historical_buildings ) . 
  i really do think that them * not * masturbating enough is a problem . 
  too much sexual tension and no relief because religion ( probably ) . 
  number of reported cases has [ gone up to 26 at the moment ] ( http://hessenschau.de/panorama/noch-mehr-meldungen-von-sexuellen-uebergriffen-auf-schlossgrabenfest,schlossgrabenfest-anzeigen-uebergriffe-100.html ) . 
  i doubt however that there are many more incoming . 
  the willingness to report these things has increased very much due to the new year 's events . 
  wait , bayern m\u00fcnchen not ruining bundesliga , seehofer gone from german politics ... 
  this sounds perfect . 
  well it refutes the notion of `` european culture '' however as this is certainly not something of only the past 50 years . 
  actually one of the achievements that helped keep europe peaceful is in fact the european union . 
  people overcame the `` we 'll just do what 's best for * my * nation '' to include a bigger , european identity . 
  this i am afraid is in danger of getting lost and i fear that peace might go with it . 
  and this is mostly due to internal bickering and selfishness , not because of migration and refugees . 
  we 'll need to figure out how to cope with those issues and find a solution where * everyone * shares their load . 
   if you ask 231 people out of 40000 you 'll roughly have an error rate of 5-8 % , which is low enough to publish . 
  yes , ** but only ** if your base is representative . 
  and this is what is being questioned . 
   european 's culture has proven to be non-harmful to both europeans and non-europeans were you paying attention in history class at all ? 
  colonization was non-harmful ? 
  [ the longest period of uninterrupted peace in europe since the height of the roman empire before the end of ww ii being only 43 years ? 
  ] ( http://www.csuchico.edu/~ktranschel/pages/h.05.longpeace.html ), 
  i do n't think that in the case of one nato member attacking another the alliance would stand together . 
  also you would probably have a huge amount of misinformation about who started what ( i mean there 's video `` evidence '' of han shooting first as well as just returning fire ) and there would n't really be time to sort it all out . 
  russia would have a field day and the us might just support the highest bidder ( or just make a suprise guest appearance ) . 
  that would mean going back to [ our usual head-bashing ways of intercultural relations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_conflicts_in_europe ) . 
  i 'll be in southern africa for three weeks in the summer . 
  so if anyone decides that it 's about time to give the bloody foreigners one can i just ask that you wait until then ? 
  `` the result is expected at 2015 '' was confused at that line . 
  took me a while to realize that they meant the time not the year .

  yeah , let 's have some good old trade wars because that never led to anything bad . 
  a fine but important difference : the eu did n't cut any ties but individual nations ( not even all eu members ) reduced their contacts . 
  up to that point the eu did n't have any form of punitive measures for things like that .

  while you might not agree with the stance that nuclear power that produces a lot of waste that to this day no one has found a long-term solution to dispose or at least keep safe it is not a big issue if you go for regenerative energy sources instead .

  just a few bullet points ( pun intended ) : - [ civil forfeiture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_forfeiture_in_the_united_states ) - [ border patrol can search your mobile devices ] ( https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 ) - [ mass surveillance in the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_surveillance_in_the_united_states ), 
  this is even sadderer :  school shootings are an `` overwhelmingly american '' phenomenon , probably due to the availability of firearms in the united states , [ 1 ] and have become common place as much to be considered as part of `` american culture '' [ 2 ] . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_shootings_in_the_united_states ^ ( yes , i know sadderer is n't a real word . ), 
  talking about a high horse you should at least look at [ germany 's climate goals and the developement of co2 emissions ] ( https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-climate-targets ) . 
  a lot of effort goes into these goals and while it should go faster than it is at least they are working on it . 
   i 'll also say that germany is the # 1 polluter in western europe it would be better if you 'd at least gone for the per capita consumption as it is a much better indicator how a whole country is doing . 
  and for a highly industrialized nation germany is doing not too terrible ( could be better of course ) . 
   probably the german goal is to try to delocalise it 's industry to china [ ... ] outsourcing happens but it certainly is n't the goal to transfer the big industries . 
  too many people would be out of work to support such a move . 
  you are sadly right about the arms exports though . 
  well you * did * have a decent song for a change .
