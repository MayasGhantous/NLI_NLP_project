oh , there certainly would . 
  i , however , would very much prefer if - by virtue of the democratic process working like it 's supposed to - it did n't come to that . 
  because that would make a travesty of the political apparatus as it is supposed to function , not least as envisoined by the founders of the frg . 
  there is n't * supposed * to be a coalition from csu all the way to the left/greens , as it is n't natural . 
  especially not a formal one . 
  and we 're seeing now how good the cduspd government is at being it 's own opposition ( meaning : policing its own policy/actions ) , when there is n't enough pressure from the opposition forces in parliament . 
  not that i necessarily disagree with the various posters in the thread who quote current polls to point towards merkel winning the 2017 election , but you guys need to take a serious look at the slew of articles currently examining how ** all ** the pollsters got ** all ** the polls wrong for yesterday 's election . 
  all of us , but especially the media , pollsters ( as well as my fellow political scientists ) , and especially the politicians need to take a long hard look at how they allowed themselves to skew perception until both , dismissing brexit and a hrc victory looked to be a certainty . 
  selective bias , [ the spiral of silence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiral_of_silence ) , the echo chamber effect of the `` mainstream '' and especially social media , etc. 
  must not be underestimated . 
  the professional progressives ( for lack of a better word ) have a tendency to be so far up their own behinds that they lose touch with the concerns of the native working - and middle class , who care very little about what they perceive to be an undue focus on affirmative action programs to accomodate and foster a variety of heterogenous , small ( ethnic , religious and ideological ) special interest groups , when they perceive * their * own long-term economic well-being and that of their children to be increasingly threatened . 
  as we 've seen recently - these are the people that still make up the qualitative majority of voters in western liberal democracies and therefore win elections . 
  so the danger to a merkel reelection in september '17 is not so much the russian meddling ( and there definitely is russian fucking meddling ) , but the very real chance of another terrorist attack , another new years eve , and another 10 months of the powers that be not engaging in an * honest * democratic dialogue regarding the opinions , prejudices , fears and hopes of the german electorate ; which will galvanize large portions of * silent * dissenters in their will to send merkel - at the helm of the country for 12 years running - a message . 
  by all means , deck the fucker . 
  most company grade officers and staff ncos of the pre-2000s bundeswehr would have privately commended any action on your part as self-defense in the face of overwhelming stupidity . 
  just the other day , i had a former msk/seebtl . - obermaat not only describe his old unit as `` basically the recon marines/marsoc of the bundeswehr '' , but also tell me ( over the course of a discussion about the g36 clusterfuck ) of how , that one time in afghanistan , a bundeswehr soldier on patrol managed to bring down/kill the pilot of an american fighter jet with his g36 , which had ( i kid you not ) erroneously entered the airspace of the german sector without identifying itself . 
  when i asked him how the * fuck * the soldier in question had achieved such an unlikely feat , his honest-to-god reply was : `` na , mit vorhalten '' . 
  the entire thing was then of course hushed up , because it was embarrassing for the americans and nobody wants to see the bundeswehr as the gung-ho superhuman studs that they are . 
  if we had n't been among a crowd of run-of-the-mill clueless german civilians , i would have gone to town on the idiot , simply for conduct unbecoming of a german soldier by going around and spreading bullshit stories like this one to the general public . 
  do n't get me wrong - he 's a generally decent guy personality wise , buth otherwise barely able to string three consecutive sentences together without repeatedly taking a moment to remind himself of what we 're taking about in the first place . 
  even when we 're discussing issues that by all means should be much more his home turf than mine ... 
  that 's really interesting - there is certainly some truth to it ( the whole `` browbeat good old germany into taking them so they are the problem of the most prosperous nation in europe '' aspect of it , which is , to a certain degree pure opportunism on the part of the other state actors ) , but the expressis verbis claim that these refugees are a result of `` us/uk wars '' should make anyone even remotely in the know regarding that subject bloody well cringe . 
  overpopulation , drought , crumbling regimes , the re-heating of the sunni/shia conflict due to a growing iran , lax/uncoordinated humanitarian/migrational/development aid policies across both , africa and the middle east over the course of the last 20 to 30 years are what brought us here . 
  the anglo-dominated war on terror is one aspect of it , but far from the driving - , let alone the dominating force . 
  on a side note , i 'm getting increasingly worried about the prevalent political/ideological attitude within the bundeswehr . 
  i 'm saying this as the closest thing to a dyed in the wool rah-rah-support-the-troops patriot you 'll ever be able to find in germany , mind you . 
  but what you 're saying here mirrors pretty much exactly what i get from conversations with the current crop of active duty enlisted and senior enlisted ( to a lesser degree from the officers ) . 
  the inner-bundeswehr attitude towards global policy and especially our nato allies has taken a distinctly , sometimes even absurdly anti-western turn since the latter half of the nineties . 
  i 'd wager a significant part of it is due to not so much to the general chip on our shoulder ( that has been around since the 50s/60s and never been much of a problem before ) , but to the large influx of east german/russlanddeutsche personnel since reunification , who increasingly provide much of the manpower of the modern bundeswehr . 
  abolishing conscription certainly has n't helped with retaining diverse/informed attitudes among the troops either , i suppose . 
  coming from a family almost entirely made up of lawyers/judges for the past four generations , i can absolutely see your point . 
  while the terms are indeed prevalent to the degree of being ( in the positive sense ) buzzwords in the polsci/soc sphere , at least when - and wherever i was studying/interning etc. , it is more the notion of the general * concept * - there being a tangible distinction between gesinnungsethik and verantwortungsethik and what this implies - being part of the bedrock of german political philosophy/policy discourse . 
  `` in the wild '' , i 've actually seen the accusation of being a * gessinungsethiker * used as an actual * ad hominem * personal slander during a policy discussion among german liberals in the course of a party convention . 
  very fittingly , too . 
  but i agree that when it comes to political talk shows and whatnot , the vocabulary itself is seldomly used . 
  if i were to personally wager why that is , i 'd suspect that the negative connotations of being labeled/identified a * gesinnungsethiker * are something people try to avoid - they act as such , but do n't like to be identified as one . 
  sorry , mate - browbeating you in any way at all absolutely was n't my intention . 
  i 'm really just generally surprised - seeing how consistently that concept popped up in all kinds of places during my stint in academia , both here and abroad , it seems kind of nuts ( to me ) that political science courses can be/are designed in a way that allow one to remain oblivious of it throught . 
  but i absolutely take your word for it having been that way , and if the course is set up in a way that omits this aspect of weberian philosophy , i see it as no fault of the students to not go looking for it - especially in an introductory course . 
  ca n't find what you do n't know to exist , after all . 
  you just nailed the problem right on the head . 
  this is what broke our collective necks last year - that damn penchanct for `` german forthrightness '' - ask me a factual question and you 'll receive a straightforeward , `` true '' answer . 
  the fact that most germans , especially among the educated elite , politicians and the media , are exceptionally naive when it comes to the realities of geopolitical strategy , only helped to exacerbate the problem . 
  here being where ? 
  germany ? 
  certainly not in my neck of the woods . 
  yeah , figures . 
  well , the hh/hb/b / etc. 
  issues on the education front are what you get when you 've had several decades worth of governments who define a successful educational policy almost exclusively by doing anything to inflate number of abitur degrees . 
  especially those attained by social strata that were previously focused on vocational tracks other than academia . 
  a perfectly valid way to s ( t ) imulate upward social mobility for the working - and lower middle classes ... 
  which bundesland , mate ? 
  it was n't part of the curricula in hamburg in the late 1990s/early 2000s , certainly not in mittelstufe . 
  i 'm afraid i 've got to disagree with both of you guys - having studied polsci with a focus on political history and ir in both , germany and the uk , i 've come across the pair/concept of * gesinnungsethik * / * verantwortungethik * multiple times , starting pretty early on - if memory serves , even as part of my introduction to politics lecture series in first year . 
  all the aspiring sociologists i came across ( predominantly in germany ) were no strangers to that particular aspect either . 
  both concepts were readily applied in discussions inside and outside of the classroom as well . 
  i 'm a bit puzzled as to why you have actually never heard of it up to this point , despite having studied weber . 
  it 's one of the main takeaways from * politik als beruf * and , as the economist article implies , the weberian distinction between the two and its role in german political philosophy is often referred to when it comes to discussing the peculiarities of german political discourse and policy-making : we 've seen a lot of that in op-eds discussing the whole `` germany , reluctant hegemon of europe '' narrative of the last decade . 
  if you get a chance , do give * politik als beruf * a read - it 's even on wikisource , i believe . 
  if not for the political ethics-definition , the historical take on the specifics of the political systems of the big nationstates of his time and how they relate to the societies that brough them forth is very interesting . 
   this reporting may work on americans no , it does n't - read the comments below the article - the wapo account commenters below raise the same issues you do , scoff at the general tone of the piece and openly mock the author ( anthony faiola , the paper 's berlin bureau chief ) , who seems to have quite the reputation for predominantly delivering exactly those kind of one-sided fluff pieces and generally biased `` reporting '' when it comes to refugee issues . 
  lovely . 
  maybe the fans of widzew lodz should go the full mile and just rename their club * `` arbeitersportverein litzmannstadt '' * , to really stress their animosity with their city rivals ? 
  i 'm not sure i completely understand what this gentleman wants from us . 
  he 's either reporting a theft , or - '' `` just do an asylum application , meier . '', 
  `` are you sure , sergeant ? 
  this guy looks pretty asian and he 's gesturing something about money , i think ... '' `` oh , you 're * thinking * , again officer ? 
  have n't you learnt anything since you graduated from training last year ? 
  start . 
  asylum . 
  application . '', 
  `` sarge , i really do n't - '' `` an asylum application , officer meier ! '', 
  * sigh * okay , fuck it , let 's do an asylum application , fuck that power tripping retard . 
  come.with.me.please.sir.yes , that 's right . 
  sit.down.here . 
  thanks . 
  now.give.me.your.passport ... '', 
  i 'm putting a tenner on sigmar gabriel . 
  my pleasure , friend . 
  it 's the type of stuff i 'm always looking for whenever i 'm an interested `` outsider '' , trying to get any kind of firsthand information on a given topic . 
  so i basically operate on the premise of `` take the time to share your observations/view/expertise whenever you have something of value to add , and hope that others will feel inspired to do the same when they are in a similar position . '', 
  ah , sorry , i mistook the intention behind your post then . 
  btw , ( at least ) i have never read claims that there are all-out * double agents * among the french intelligence / national security scene . 
  it is all due to systemic , structural opsec breaches . 
  meaning : the issue is the fact that the channels of inter - and intra-government/agency / `` trigger-puller '' communication are compromised so widely and on so many levels , that it has become an issue for not only france 's international partners but also the french intelligence/national security apparatus * itself * to get the necessary information for both , day-to-day operations and immediate action issues spread in time to the necessary people without hard-to-pinpoint `` leakage '' that has repeatedly tipped off the people who were being observed/set up . 
  cheers , mate . 
  just to stress that point again - the iterations of the conflict that concerned my schoolmates/friends also were a world away in intensity from what i 'm observing among the `` recent arrivals / devout practicioners of their fate '' crowd . 
  it was a general sentiment , a `` that 's just how it is '' type notion/explanation for small but persistent/recurring altercations that , to the eye of the `` uninitated '' observer , might just as well have been rooted in other common types of young adult ingroup-outgroup friction : lefties vs. preppies , have 's vs. have-not 's , nerds vs. jocks , * gymnasium * vs. * realschule/hauptschule * and so on . 
  absolutely trivial `` nonsene '' that was only curious because regardless of what what the `` detonator '' of the most recent iteration , it seemed to magically always regress to the sunni/shia thing between people who appeared to be , by and large , pretty non-zealous in terms of religion and laid back in general . 
  talk about implicit cultural heritage . 
  yes and no . 
  in the strictest sense , you are correct . 
  we 're currently ( for the last few years , certainly ) seeing an increase in incidents caused by `` loosely affiliated '' terrorists with little to no direct , tangible ties to hierarchical , structured terror cells of `` parent networks '' like what the predecessors of isis were ( the various `` al quaeda in xyz '' 's ) , laschkar-e taiba , boko haram , etc. 
  and especially al quaeda . 
  those kinds of terror attacks have , accroding to the majority of voices in the security policy community , been made practially impossible ( knocking on wood here ) to carry out by some 15 years of honing detection and prevention methods in the wake of 9/11 . 
  those that have been in planning have been prevented at varying stages before the planned execution - some of those have made it into the media , many more were never even brough to the attention of the public . 
  paris was an anomaly of course , but not really unexprected . 
  i 've read in several different places for quite a few years running now that the counter-terrorism situation in france was/is pretty dire , thanks to a host of reasons - among them the fact that islamist sympathizers/informers have compromised the french national security/police/intelligence community . 
  keep in mind that precisely due to the above facts though , terror organizations have increasingly switched their mo to exactly the types of attacks we 've seen for the last few months/years : the thalys train , the various brussles attacks and incidents , the vast majority of things happening in france , the incident ( s ) in germany and so on . 
  `` self-radicalization '' and/or minimally supported `` lone wolf/small cell '' attacks are looking to become the new norm .
