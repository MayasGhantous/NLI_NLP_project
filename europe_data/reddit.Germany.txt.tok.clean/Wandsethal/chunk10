  when it came to the implementation of these policies in the coalition negotiations , they stonewalled . 
  the fdp agreed to a cdu-led coalition anyway , thinking broad public support in that area gave them enough of a mandate to wrestle concessions from the cdu further down the line - this did n't happen . 
  it then all came to a head at the hight of the first round of greek/southern europe bailouts : merkel decided to lay down the law by taking a political stance that was fundamentally traditional social democratic policy ( very large bailouts/guarantees with very few questions asked at the time ) and declaring it 's implementation `` without alternative '' . 
  the fdp , who are traditional economically lassaiz-faire market liberals opposed to such policies , were in a bind : vote against the merkel line and dissolve the governing coalition one-sidedly ( cdu has been their only real option for government coalitions in modern germany so they 'd never see regional or federal government power again in the forseeable future ) , which the public was not in favor of at that point , as they did n't know how expensive the whole bailout thing would become yet . 
  vote against the merkel line without dissolving the coalition and see the line pass anyway , backed by the combined votes of the majority of all other parties in parliament ( all politically left of the cdu anyway ) . 
  or vote in accordance with the merkel line after trying to wrest some concessions from her ( did n't happen ) and trying to sell it to the public as being the best possible/necessary course at the time . 
  after lots of soul searching and in-fighting , they went with the last option . 
  the public did n't buy it and the press gleefully exploited this as being the perfect example of why the fdp was an entirely superfluous party : they offer nothing the other parties do n't offer as well and when it comes to implementing * their * usps , they fail . 
  ** [ part 2 below ] **, 
  for certain parts of die linke , that 's absolutely true - problem is that they are , togehter with the greens , policy wise by far the most heterogenous political party in germany . 
  their membership ranges from traditionally internationalist europhiles ( a recent public example of that subgroup would be their syriza-supporters : a lot of the `` facts '' of syriza 's anti-german campaign over the last couple of years , right down to the german words for some downtown athens graffitis as well as the posters/banners at demonstations in syntagma square and elsewhere have been provided by members of the linke ) , also represented by their members among the european left europarty on the one side ; across a vast middle ground of different shades of grey ( or red/purple ) to the almost `` national-socialist '' views of some of their ( geographically predominantly ) east-german retro-stalinist zombies , who pride themselves in their past importance in what they still consider `` the morally superior of the two germanies '' , and faithfully follow russian state media - the only fair , balanced , unbiased source of information in the modern world . 
  to the latter , `` the big struggle '' never ended and `` the americans/eu/capitalists '' are using `` the muslims/consumerism / social change '' to undermine the traditional values of `` german society '' in order to bring about total dominance of their ideology . 
  and that is where they connect , horseshoe-theory-like , with the increasingly ` moscovite ' afd and the other , traditional right wing parties in germany . 
  which also explains , as you rightly pointed out , much of the afd 's success - especially in former east germany and among the ` russian germans ' . 
  i know , right ? 
  but i 've encountered exactly this argument ( and countless more 9of the same quality ) in actual discussion with these types . 
  i actually believe it is part of an actually * learned * , traiditional leftist/marxist strategy : throw people `` off the scent '' of their immediate own argument against you by using obvious nonsense rhetorical `` flashbang/smoke grenades '' ( another thing they love to do is pick on a specific word/turn of phrase you just used and demand you to explain its use in this context , thus turning any discussion into a debate on semantics until you 've lost your initial train of though ) that will disorient you long enough to steer conversation away from the concrete point at hand , ideally somewhere completely unrelated or an area where you are on less firm ground , in order for them to swoop in and monopolize/control the course of the conversation again . 
  this is especially effective when its more than just you two people arguing - while you are becoming with increasingly frustrated with the frequent , unexpected , nonsensical turns in conversation and left with an increasing sense of vertigo , any general audience that wants to stay abreast of the conversation will only be able to follow the immediate topic at hand and therefore has little to no mental capacity left to continuously clock all the successive `` nonsense '' scattered over the course of it , much less remember the fact that the initial point of debate has been lost , and the original question remains unanswered . 
  certainly . 
  as i said - i can only speak for what i 've seen from , say , about 50 or so pictures from largely rural andalusia and another dozen or so of madrid , taken by two members of the then high middle class/lower upper class ( the grandfather was a physician to alfons xiii. , the father ended up building/running a large construction company ) whose hobby was photography . 
  the fishing and wine-making picures are really similar , though . 
  i 'm super sorry - i 've started writing a reply i ca n't finish tonight , but you 'll get an in depth answer to your question as soon as i 've got the time to do so tomorrow !, 
  arrgh - how ?!, 
  you do n't mean the `` private surfing '' mode of my browser , do you ? 
  because whatever link from whatever source i click on that leads me to fopo automatically has me logged in via my fopo account . 
  affirmative !, 
  thanks , mate . 
  accidentally clicking through to foreignpolicy.com articles is a real pain for cheapskates like me , who do n't spring for the subscription fee and thus blow their number of monthly free articles on reddit-links , instead of using them on tom ricks ' blog , like they actually intend to . 
  i think they exist , to a certain extent , everywhere in the world . 
  they only get dangerous when enough people get fed up with the status quo to a degree that has them consider measures as drastic as giving that particular brand of snake oil a try . 
  i 'll keep that in mind for my emigration prospects though , should the domestic/european situation continue down its current path . 
  i initially had the us in mind , but from taking an in-depth look at the course of american domestic goings-on/social climate since the start of obamaii , i 'm increasingly realizing that i 'd be trading a future aneurism for a present acute migraine . 
  by the time i actually make up my mind , you will probably have long colsed your borders to the flood of desperate europeans though . 
  my best friend is exceptionally lucky though : went to bc for his ma in 2012 , stayed for the girlfriend and now found employment with good prospects . 
  smart bastard . 
  fwiw , at least in my neck of the woods , tierschutzpartei , in policy , is very close to peta levels of anti-human radicalism and outside of the animal realm , a lot of the fringe-left eco-eccentricities of the greens : anti-vaxxers , chemtrails , homeopathy , electrosmog , education reforms and peace movement etc. . 
  personally , i would n't want them anywhere near an actual government , and as marginalized in parliament as possible . 
  whatever sensible positions one might attest to them are well covered by other parties . 
  and here is really where the media/social climate of the last four or so years is to blame . 
  by an at times almost crusade-like movement to marginalize and then do away with the fdp ( liberals as per the european definition of the word ) , germany has robbed itself of its one traditional political voice of social pragmatism ( as opposed to social-engineering prone normativism ) . 
  fdp , regardless of how tiny its hypothetical fraction in parliament , would have filled the position of voicing concern/doubt about the practical issues pertaining the `` migrant wave '' ; the utter disregard for existing european law ; the lack of a much needed modern immigrational policy law for germany to begin with . 
  all while being firmly rooted in its democratic traiditions and none of the hard-right/putinist / * wutb\u00fcrger * underbelly that turned a practically `` fdp-light for fiscally literate , cosmopolitan , city-dwelleing intellectuals '' early afd into the nothing-to-lose xenophobic freakshow it is now . 
  rising support for fdp would have led to their inclusion in more state parliaments and subsequently governments and a concession to some of their points regarding the migrant issue by the other parties , who now ca n't climb down from their * alternativlos * brinkmanship of last summer without losing face . 
  +1 for outstanding command of the german language . 
  i salute you , mate !, 
  prost !, 
  my pleasure . 
  it is the result of many years and countless attempts to discuss past and present policy , ideology , as well as current events and history with people from all over germany ( really , their western brethren are oftentimes worse than the ` original ' ex-gdr specimen ) who subscribe to these views . 
  and i say `` attempts '' not to denigrate these people as intellectually challenged troglodytes ( they have some very smart people preaching their gospel too , and everything else in-between besides ) , but as an indicator that it is extremely difficult to make inroads against any single part of their overall wholistic world-view whatsoever , regardless of how tiny and blantantly , factually incorrect it may be . 
  you start with picking out a sinlge aspect - the non-renewal of the reinsurance treaty for example , three sentences later you 're interrupted again and the next time you get a word in edegewise , your entire train of thought ( or any attempt to follow them down their intellectual rabbithole ) has just been utterly derailed by your immediate need to vociferously protest against their carelessly thrown-in notion that * `` x is just as much a proven fact as the truth that '' * hiv/aids is an american-engineered weapon of biological warfare , either tested out in africa and subsequently unable to be contained by the hapless americans ; or employed there to wreak havok in the first place in order to keep the wise , noble , savage negroes of `` all of africa '' from siding with their socialist liberators against western imperialist oppression/capitalist slavery . 
  should you still manage to force them into a position where they are about to have to concede the point that this entire claim is a long disproven old ussr propaganda-lie , they 'll immediately shout something completely incoherent from an area most people have a less-than-firm grip on : * `` well , if you look at the target2 figures , it really all becomes clear !, 
  for africa ? 
  target is limited to european financial ... '' * `` but ca n't you see how it 's all one big ponzi scheme to systematically beggar the working man in favor of ... '' * and round and round it goes . 
  ** edit : ** ah , the `` international brigade '' has come by this post in the meantime . 
  in case there are any stragglers who are only reading this now : good morning , comrades !, 
  this is an exceptionally informative post , many thanks for it . 
  a lot of the pictures look a great deal like the photos the father/grandfather of my spanish * brother * - in-law took in rural southern spain between the 1920s and 70s - with maybe a decade of `` time difference '' ( 1960s portugal looks like 1950s spain etc. ) . 
  and good grief , matheus . 
  my elderly aunt absolutely lives on that stuff ( has done so since time immortal ) , she goes through at least two bottles a week . 
  i could never warm to it , then again , i do n't much like ros\u00e9 to begin with - now , your heavy douro-reds on the other hand ... 
  you got a good couple of answers in your previous replies , just to add a little to that : the crucial point really is that the left is the current incarnation of the gdr state party , so they have a lot of clout with everyone who feel they have lost more than they gained since reunification on at least one level or another ( personal wealth , career opportunities , personal prestige , `` dangers '' of society infringing on personal life/family , dubious prospects regarding the future etc. ) . 
  another major factor at play is the lasting effect of 40 + years of gdr propaganda : anti west germany , anti-us , anti- `` capitalism '' , anti-globalization , pro-ussr/russia , pro isolationism etc. 
  so anyone wo looks for `` easy '' answers to the increasingly complex issues of this day day and age - regarding exploitation of information technology/spying , international and national security issues , personal wealth/labor developments especially in contrast with european integration , european fiscal policy , ( european ) migration policy and the likes ; will find them with the left . 
  which tends to produce a more or less wholistic , largely self-affirmative world view that looks a great deal like this : we had the global financial crisis thanks to the us ( evil capitalists who still have military bases in germany while the goodly russians abandoned theirs , from which they spy on us and wage their wars against muslims into which they then drag us too , which they subsequently lose so we get settled with all the muslims ) which brought the euro we did n't want in the first place down , which forced us to bail out greece with `` our money '' , while also stifling our economy and that of the poor misunderstood russians by all those nasty sanctions , just because america hates putin personally and does n't want russia to reclaim its `` natural '' position as second power in the world generally ; and they especially hate the `` naturally '' cordial russo-german friendship , which has existed forever and would have spared us from any and all world wars , had we not abandoned them for the always-doomed-to-fail project of german western integration since the 1890s . 
  to make up for the loss of absolutely vital trade with russia , they are now trying to force us into ttip , which will result in germany being banned from exporting anything anywhere for legal reasons , while being forced to import and consume gmo-foods , chlorine-chicken and even more nasty american music , movies and tv shows that poison the bodies and minds of the last few remaining germans ( that have not yet been displaced by the invading muslims ) and turn us into consumerist zombies that wo n't prostest european dictatorship/american world dominance . 
  so we must vote for the party that promises us that : german money will be used for germans only ; quitting nato and disbanding the german bundeswehr will keep us out of any and all global responsibilities ( we do n't have any ! ), 
  forever ; quitting the euro and as much of the european project as possible will keep us from having any `` european responsibilities '' in the first place - anything beyond that can be dealt with in bi-national legistlation and memorandums anyway ; the only real struggle is that against `` capitalist exploitation of the working classes '' , which is to be won at home first and then , if possible , exported to other countries through the support of like-minded parties abroad . 
  edit : last paragraph added, 
  cheers mate . 
  this is a right clusterf * ck indeed . 
  i would n't be surprised if pis just brushes aside whatever the commission comes up with anyway , as they 've done in the past - at least rethorically . 
  turly looks like everyone climbed pretty much right up to the top of their existing flagpoles and have neither an idea of how - , nor any intention to get down from there again . 
  i 'll keep my fingers crossed that truly necessary policy changes wo n't fall to the wayside until the 've figured it out . 
  poland has been doing so well in recent years , it would be a shame if your continuous advance within europe would be hobbled by the dogmatists . 
  and tasty !, 
  as long as they are young , or have been soaked in buttermilk/yoghurt for a good long while ... 
  this guy wants to clear out the bialowitz forest ?!, 
  why , so his landrover can get him closer to the bison and he has better sight lines to shoot higher scoring red stags from a cushier raised stand , without getting his boots wet ? 
  f * ck him . 
  any hunter worth their salt is a conservationist first - the few natural forests we have left in europe need our protection . 
  look at what they are doing in transylvania - the all-out logging operations backed by international mafia syndicates there are a crime beyond measure . 
  you know , i 've been looking at the situation in poland with a certain sense of incredulous bemusement in the past - ` let 's see how far they are willing to let these guys disappear up their own arses until they are so fed up that they go and elect the other side again ' type-of-sentiment , but the more concrete details i hear , the more i actually find myself get angry on behalf of the polish people in general . 
  apart from the very vew dyed-in-the-wool conspiracy theorists , the outright lunatics , the rah-rah-russia-hawks and the uber-catholics who believe in their personal little ` crusades ' and are blind to anything else , it very much looks like the nepotism will just have a different face to it . 
  that ca n't be what the average pis voter had in mind , surely ? 
  i know very well that this kind of thing is a hallmark of absolutely every post-soviet/socialist society to varying degrees - i 've certainly seen it in east germans * and the few russian-germans who relocated here in the 90s that i met so far - but the fact that these guys , who got their mandate from the polish people in no small part precisely because they said they 'd do away with nepotism and ` push the fat hogs from the trough ' so the ` little people ' get their fair share , apparently just brazenly turn around and hog the trough for themselves ; really has me shaking my head in awe . 
  * even in those who have no conscious gdr histories themselves and can only be operating by some kind of hind-brain conditioning their parents/environment , must have instilled in them - this ` instinct ' that you 're missing out because someone is one-upping you , keeping things from you that you have some intrinsic right to , so it 's perfectly fine to use any and all means necessary to ` get your share too ' - seems to be there ), 
  absolutely incredible . 
  let 's hope this guys is a ` hands off ' - type manager , or they 'll dig up a pro-pis person with a lot more horse-sense asap . 
  you bet your pet goat i am !, 
  if only my ancestors had been subjected to such timeless pearls of wisdom as * `` my mother told me never to trust men with beards , sir !, 
  * just * when i thought i could n't love you people any more than i already do . 
  please do n't change , poland . 
  no , seriously . 
  especially not your constitution , unless you have a legetimate legal/democratic mandate to do so . 
  god bless . 
  while i wo n't commit myself to either side on this issue ( simply due to sheer lack of knowledge regarding the formal legal process pertaining to this matter in poland ) i 'm all for excercising one 's right to participation in the democratic process , always . 
  battle it out poland , show europe how democracy by the people , for the people works . 
  you 'll emerge a stronger country , i have every faith in your people , both sides . 
  seriously ?!, 
  you could n't make this shit up if you tried ... is he into `` alternative medicine '' / homeopathy as well ?
