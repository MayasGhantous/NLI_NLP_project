  think of it like tactics in football/soccer - over the course of a few years , each current `` ultimate uncrackable system-of-play '' will get found out and neutralized , until the next top team adapts/invents a new `` ultimate uncrackable system-of-play '' that dominated the opposition at will for the next few years . 
  spain/barcelona 's posession football ruled supreme for about five years , until it was cracked by first one/two top teams and eventually , even mediocre teams on a good day managed to effectively contain them . 
  * ring ring ring * ** ladies and gentlemen , we 've got a winner !, 
  ** i 'm currently messing about in the `` integration industry '' , teaching basic language/cultural integration courses for the people who came during/since last year 's asylum seeker wave . 
  one of the chief issues/concerns in absolutely * every * course is the issue of sunni vs. shia ( or even worse : christan convert iranians ) or , more broadly speaking all-other-muslims vs. iranians animosity . 
  no , let me rephrase that : * hostility * . 
  you have near-secular kurds and nearly western-level educated syrians casually calling them at best `` misguided fools '' , more often than not `` pitiful apostates of the true faith '' and sometimes `` the very scurge of righteous islam , who must either convert or will eventually be eradicated '' . 
  they ( and america and the jews ^ tm of course ) are considered to be the chief reason for the troubles of the middle east and the issues with islam . 
  my students generally being very disciplined ( and having a lot of formal respect for their teachers , at least in front of said teachers faces - the stuff they talk in languages they recon the native krauts do n't understand notwithstanding ) , this more often than not takes the form of what progressive sociology cally microagressions : `` of course * you * would think/say that '' ; `` well you 're iranian , so you have * no idea * '' ; `` cinnamon does n't belong in proper * chai * , what the fuck is wrong with you ?!, 
  '' , `` it 's all right , it 's all right - god will prove you wrong in the end and then we 'll see who rots in hell '' are some actual examples i 've witnessed over the course of * weeks * in several different classes . 
  talking privately , i 've heard from quite a few iranians that they are facing abuse not only from fellow asylum seekers , but also from the `` german '' security guards with predominatly turkish background . 
  due to the migrant wave and corresponding desperate need for such personnel , the powers-that-be within the german job/employment/education market are positively throwing \u00a7 34a-certificates ( which allow you to work as an entry level security guard ) at absolutely anyone with two brain cells and a pulse . 
  so a lot of these guards are school/trainee/primary job market dropouts with an axe to grind , strong sectarian streaks and a pathologically massive inferiority complex , to boot . 
  they are the stereotypical 2nd/3rd generation german-born `` balkans-muslim losers '' and members of the underachieving , mal-integrated `` turkish '' proletariat who compensate the unsavory aspects of their own lives/biographies with agressively howling about how * their * great president erdogan is leading * their * turkish homeland to its rightful place in the sun . 
  on a slightly different note - this also checks out with my fellow ( former ) * gymnasium * schoolmates , quite a few of whom are 2nd generation immigrants from iran . 
  these generally excellently integrated , throughly german guys and gals regularly got shit from ( only the less fortunate , go figure ) members of the turkish/balkan muslim persuation . 
  on the face of it for all kinds of nonsensical reasons ( betraying their heritage , not taking `` islam '' seriously , wearing the wrong kind of clothes , being able to afford more/better/other things and so on ) , but the root of it always was - well over a decade ago already - `` do n't mind them [ my confused ethnically german friend ] , they 're retards . 
  they hate me because i 'm irani , because we 're shia . '', 
  to come full circle again : i 've studied polsci with a focus on ir and security policy for seven years , i 'm a history-nut and the * mess in the middle east ^ tm * has been a personal hobby horse since 9/11 , so i was well aware of the sunni/shia conflict and its implications throughout history . 
  but seeing and feeling , firsthand , the vibes in my `` mixed '' classrooms has truly driven home the sheer dimension and power of the inner-islamic scism . 
  it 's the root of much , if not most of the world 's issues with islam today and anyone who thinks it is shallow or trivial enough to be mended within the immediate to medium future , even if all participants were willing to do so and actively work towards a solution , is a fucking moron . 
  for clarities sake - the animosity is n't one-sided at all , of course . 
  accroding to the iranians ( observing muslims , atheists and christian converts alike ) , the/all sunnis are the root and ( sole ) reason for islamic extremism around the world . 
  nevermind hezbollah , muktada al sadr , the revolutionary guard and the plethora of other shia militia/terrorist groups the world has seen . 
  those were/are only rightously defending themselves and/or islam against judeo-american imperialism , of course . 
  half-empty regional rail traincar late in the evening , takbir-screaming well built young dude , armed with an axe and a knife , turning a family of asian tourists into mince before your very eyes . 
  screaming , commotion , blood splattering absolutely everywhere . 
  your call . 
  thing is , most people who are not trained to override their instincts in such a situation will simply freeze , especially when the hostile is n't coming directly at you just yet . 
  the days where german men went through mandatory military training in large enough numbers to potentially have thalys-style interventionists among that crowd on a car like this , on a night like this pretty much zero . 
  also , that kind of terrorist attacks has n't been enough of a topic in germany yet that you 'd get american-style `` what to do when you find yourself in this type of situation '' expert advice on news-chanel panels for people to pick up even unconciously . 
  and as i said above - most people * anywhere * when faced with such a situation will not even flee , they will just freeze . 
  forget about restraining him - they wo n't even venture to distract him or pull the emergency break , but stare on is abject horror . 
  on a personal note : `` even '' i myself , with a basic amount of self-defense training , knowing i 'm not the freezing-type from previous dicey situations , all the while being rudimentary prepared to deal with a direct threat to myself ( i refuse to say ` i 'm armed ' , because technically , i 'm not ) , would n't dream to try and subdue that particular guy in that kind of situation , unless i knew there were people around who seem mentally/physically prepared to help me with that task . 
  i 'd do anything possible to distract/neutralize him , most likely by raising a hell of a ruckus and throwing everything and the kitchen sink at him to make him stop attacking his victims and lose his weapon so i/other people get a chance to jump him and clobber him beyond any ability to fight back , but going in with the express prupose of just restraining him ? 
  personally , i 'm neither trained , nor equipped , nor crazy enoug to go into that kind of situation with that goal in mind . 
  you are right on the money with your statement , mate . 
  even after `` selection '' , the classes i happen to work with ( a culture and integration / basic level german language hybrid that runs for 10 weeks ) are so heterogenous it frequently splits one 's head open . 
  a third of the class comes with rudimentary university education ( too little to have degrees transferred and mostly in humanities anyway so at least mid-term useless for the german labor market ) and/or a basic level of tradecraft experience ( no degrees in that of course so shit out of luck to immediately/short-term find work in that field in germany ) , another third may have went to school somewhat regularily for at least some of their youth but has n't gone in the last couple of years ( due to various reasons - money , war , boredom - you name it ) and does n't have any degrees either , and another third ( if you 're lucky , sometimes significantly more ) is not only illiterate but does n't even speak their own language/main dialect to a level that allows our few interpreters to get across to them . 
  they are more often than not in their mid thirties , come from subsistence agriculture backgrounds where they literally were in charge of the one family goat/three family chickens for the majority of their lives . 
  they 've never made it past ( or even to ) elementary school , never owned a book , never used public transport , do n't really know what laws/rules ( or flushing toilets , leave alone issues like recycling or keeping appointments/legal documents ) that go beyond the scope of common-sense-day-to-day-survival are for . 
  so halfway into trying to teach everyone how to read/say the time in german , while trying to make the lesson as simple and logical as possible , you realize that these guys have no concept of where the hell the sun goes when it happens to be dark outside . 
  does it fall into the ocean and go out and god creates it anew every morning ? 
  does it go to sleep like the people and the animals ? 
  by the time you 've shaken yourself out of your thousand-yard-stare of intellectual shellshock , you realize that kaspar-hauser-had-a-farm in front of you is still patiently waiting for you to finish your explanation , while the afpak/irani/syrian middle class have long stopped rolling their eyes in boredom and are either busy playing clash of clans on their iphones , or dicking around on facebook/instagram , looking at pictures of the most recent teheran/shiraz/damascus / islamabad/karachi boozer they have missed last weekend . 
  as someone currently working in the german `` integration industry '' , allow me to go on record with : fuck that guy and the goat he rode in on . 
  eeehhh - something something , pokemon go ? 
  i 'll put my money on `` wifi disconnected '' . 
  whatever it was though - someone clearly got his goat . 
  well in that case - bravo zulu to the cops . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'd be more than happy if that were the case - but i 'm quoting the 11 pm local official statement from the w\u00fcrzburg pd press officer , who emphasized that he could not comment on wether or not he was shot or , indeed , contained . 
  there goes the neighborhood , so to speak . 
  german person here - no further news as of yet . 
  the w\u00fcrzburg police press officer has given a first statement just now ( 2300hrs local ) and said no more than what is in the newsbrief above - man on train went on a rampage with an axe , several people injured ( 4 critical , 14 lightly ) , no confirmation wether or not the threat has been contained - no confirmation the perpetrator has been neutralized , that is . 
  indeed . 
  from what i 've heard on the news so far regarding the names of the perpetrators of the coup ( apart from the g\u00fclen thing , which i 'll just disregard for the moment since he 's been erdogan 's non-isis , non-kurdish default baddie for ages now ) , we 're looking at a bunch of disgruntled * field officers * . 
  let 's hope the pilots are exceptionally good at thair craft , then - the last thing anyone involved needs is a fighter going down , for whatever reason , in that city on top of the carnage already happening tonight . 
  makes sense , but why not fly patterns above/around erdogan 's corridor of arrival or chose some other form of being close at hand on standby ? 
  in a situation as volatile as the current one ( especially with potenial hostile aircraft in your airspace and at least a small chance of all kinds of potential aa-equipement in the hands of hostile elements on the ground ) one dumb mistake might send a well-fuelled f16 crashing into one of the most densely populated cities in ( south ) eastern europe . 
  they certainly ca n't fly cas for the pro-government elements on the ground - even if they were carrying the loadout to do so . 
   two deafening booms as fighter jet flies low over istanbul are the jets doing anything of value there by going supersonic low above downtown istanbul , or are those moto flyovers purely for show ? 
  also : whose side were * they * on again anyway ? 
  that 's the only sensible answer i keep coming up myself , but again - to achieve * what ? 
  * it makes no damn sense at all , not even as a `` consolation tantrum '' . 
  i 'd `` buy '' an attempted bombing of the presidential palace , but this ? 
  right , as of now , it looks very much like the coup has failed/is failing - erdogan is in istanbul ( moronic move unless it were safe for him to be there ) , no doubt about to make an appearance of some sort in order to win as many hearts and minds as possible from those as of yet undecided , while the putschists - are busy bombing * parliament * , pretty much the manifest , architectural symbol of the concept of democracy itself . 
  what the * hell * are they actually trying to achive here , apart from alienating those who still support them at this point and any and all favorable elements abroad ? 
  do n't make me get my tinhat and ponder the feasibility of the largest-scale false flag operation of the modern era - too many people have died tonight to even contemplate going down that particular rabbit hole ... 
  so who the hell would order the bombing of parliament - rogue unit/commander ? 
  you 're certainly correct , mate . 
  in this particular case though - with `` erdogan-turkey '' becoming evermore erdogan-centric in an almost personality cult sort of way ( according to his supporters : * turkey is erdogan is turkey * ) securing the man himself would have taken a hell of a lot of wind out of the sails of the loyalists . 
  he certainly would n't have had the chance to personally call on people to rise up against the putschists on tv . 
  and who knows how many of the high-to-mid-level leaders would have stuck their necks out in defense of an erdogan currently in custody of the putschists . 
  looks like what held true for colonel claus von stauffenberg 72 years ago holds true today : * if you want your coup to succeed , you better make damn sure to take out the head of the system you 're putsching against right at the start . 
  * if not , you 're going to lose ground very quickly , especially when one by one , the not-yet-coerced/undecided start falling in with the loyalist faction in a calculated attempt to better be safe than sorry before the day is over . 
  as long as i get the bulbs man , as long as i get the bulbs !, 
  he 's just one of the many people who switch from being proponents of universal human rights to being proponents of [ cultural relativism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_relativism ) whenever their metanarrative demands it . 
  you know , there is a certain subsection of postmodernist `` intellectuals '' and people who follow their teachings ( when it comes to braindead dogmatism and an inhumane penchant for violent means , they are not all that different from the salafists either ) - for whom the application of mullah moron 's teachings here i would n't consider all that great of a tragedy . 
  at least for a limited amount of time , so tht they can maybe get their priorities straight . 
  now , i know that makes me a shitty democrat in principle . 
  but i firmly believe that people who actively oppose reason , largely reject objective facts and deny the existence of the general concept of `` reality '' when it does n't suit their narrative are dangerous and should be treated as such . 
  nah , that one 's a commie - i 'm gon na declare an antipope !, 
  never you mind the hit to catholic moral authority - with all the successful crusading we 're gon na be doing , our moral authority will soon be boosted into the stratosphere !, 
  was `` empire '' an option ? 
  seriously though - wenn they make the lightbulbs happen , i 'll emigrate !, 
  i 'll even tolerate the smoking in pubs and learn weird new weights , measurements and currency !, 
  good to know that there is - or at least was - some truth to it then . 
  i honestly have n't been to aldi in ages since there 's none in my general vicinity anymore , while lidl and netto are pretty close by . 
  and nord 's were pretty shabby when they first rolled around i remember . 
  i 'd wager the increasing pressure by lidl 's partially brand name product range also brought about some change in `` our '' aldi . 
   the american turks are , on the average , secular , academic , and urban middle-class members , while turks living in europe are from rural eastern anatolia , ethnically and religiously oriented , and vulnerable to islamism . 
  their integration in germany has failed . 
  this here is the nexus of most of the trouble with especially the turks living in germany - those of them that make trouble in the first place , that is . 
  it 's the difference between the us being in a position to actively pick out the people they want to allow in , and germany receiving people turkey was eager to get rid of at the time for a variety of reasons . 
  another factor not to be discounted , is `` second generation syndrome '' , which routinely leads to children or grandchildren of even the most benign immigrants turning into comparatively rabid ethno-nationalists/tribalists . 
  all hail aldi nord , most glorious of aldis !, 
  truth be told , common wisdom here seems to be that aldi s\u00fcd is better - any truth to that , or are they telling you the same thing about aldi nord down south ? 
  a few more current but mostly historic mottos of germany/german states : * hamburg , colloquially/contemporary : * hamburg , das tor zur welt * ( hamburg , gate [ way ] to the world ) * hamburg , actual : * \u201e libertatem quam peperere maiores digne studeat servare posteritas `` * - may the freedom our elders have achieved be honored and upheld by posterity * schleswig-holstein ( modern german state , historic dual duchies ) * `` up ewig ungedeelt '' * - forever undivided * bremen ( historic city state ) : * `` buten un binnen , wagen un winnen '' * - at home and abroad , dare and win * hannover ( kingdom , also royal motto of the welfs ) : * `` nunquam retrorsum '' * - never back * oldenburg ( grand duchy and house of oldenburg ) : * `` ein gott , ein recht , eine wahrheit '' * one god , one law/due/right , one truth * w\u00fcrttemberg ( kingdom , royal motto ) : * `` furchtlos und treu '' * - fearless and loyal * saxony ( kingdom , motto of the wettin dynasty ) : * `` fideliter er constanter '' * - faithful and steadfast * bavaria ( kingdom , motto of the wittelsbach dynasty ) : * `` in treue fest '' * - firm in loyalty * prussia ( royal motto under frederick i , margrave of brandenburg , first king in prussia ) : * `` suum cuique '' * - to each his own * prussia ( royal motto under frederick william i ) : * `` non soli cedit '' * - not even to the sun he 'll yield ( intended meaning : perseverance of the eagle ( prussia ) against the the sun ( france ) * prussia ( royal motto under frederick the great ) : * `` pro gloria et patria '' * - for glory and the fatherland * prussia/germany ( teutonic order , late kingdom of prussia , 2nd german empire ) : * `` gott mit uns * '' - god with me/us super incomplete list - this is purely from memory , which seems to be fading - feel free to reply with more , i 'm always happy to learn some new ones !, 
  ** edit : ** one more , for good measure : alleged motto of the [ victual brothers/likedeelers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victual_brothers ) - german pirates , especially their leader [ klaus st\u00f6rtebeker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klaus_st%c3%b6rtebeker ) : * `` gottes freund und aller welt feind '' * - a friend of god , an enemy to the whole world, 
  that 's between you , the basques and the brits i 'm afraid .
