  be warned though - [ the last time the brits tried something similar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arab%e2%80%93israeli_conflict#national_movements ) , it took over thirty years of double-dealing and flip-flopping until they 'd created a situation absolutely * none * of the involved parties were happy with , including ( perhaps especially ) they themselves . 
  the fallout from that is a source of a lot of the global unrest we see today . 
  i 'm not even sure we 'd want mallorca , to be honest - we 'd have to fight the brits * and * most likely also the russians over posession in any case and i 'm not at all sure our [ fallschirmj\u00e4gers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_crete ) are up for another island campaign at this point in history . 
  or any other part of our armed forces , for that matter . 
  possible , possible . 
  does n't change the fact that we do n't have 'em anymore , though !, 
  next thing you know , they 're holding seperate secret negotiations with the basques and catalonians , promising them both support for annexing the same piece of territory in northern spain/southern france , if only they rise up against the vile eu bureaucrats ... 
  well , this guy does n't look suspiciously stereotypical * at all * . 
  also - screw him . 
  on a related note : anyone here any idea what/how the chatter in the islamist part of the internet is currently going in response to the bombing ? 
  no worries mate , i was just kidding . 
  thing is , while fischkopp is a mildly derogatory term for * every * north-german to the people living south of , say , hannover - in hamburg itslef it turns into an actual insult against bremers , or even more specifically fans of werder bremen the football club . 
  so my immediate reaction to anyone calling me a fischkopp is always * `` oi !, 
  '' * , until i realize it 's most likely a `` southron '' using that term and them going * `` yeah , right you are !, 
  proud northerner here indeed !, 
  '' * glad to hear you enjoyed your time with us , mate . 
  a nice little trick to soften the blow to the rightfully patriotic bavarians/munchies when you tell them of your preference for hamburg is to immediately follow this up with pointing out how much * worse * than hamburg and munich/bavaria pretty much every * other * place in germany is - expressly citing berlin as an example . 
  also , do keep saying moin and moin moin occasionally - just tell them you 're practicing your foreign language skills . 
  i 'm always happy when i come across the occasional southron who located to hamburg but sticks to `` gr\u00fc\u00df gott '' . 
  the sentiment behind is what counts . 
  if i 'd get a euro for every time one of my language students has said * `` das wetter ist schwul '' , `` heute ist es sehr schwul '' * etc. 
  i 'd have a fair bit of money toegether . 
  it happens often , even when the students know the difference . 
  umlauts are a bitch and half to pronounce for many people with a different linguistic background . 
  ha , thought so !, 
  in that case i have a pretty similar-looking actual * physical * photo from either 2000 or 2005 somewhere around my place ... great area , lots of fond memories - thanks for sharing , i 'll gladly take any fish-related insults for that . 
  hey , i think i remember that one - north-ish but close to campo de fiori ? 
  see ? 
  this is whee your bikes went . 
  now stop blaming us !, 
  any of the rabble that feels roused by the recent speeches and calls-to-action by president erdogan , i suggest you go relocate to turkey post haste . 
  do n't forget to leave your various european citizenships at the proverbial door though . 
  this club is for `` descendants of nazism '' and anyone else who is serious about embracing our values only . 
  if you feel inclined to start shit here , so help you god , we 'll whack you . 
  we have enough other troublemakers here as it is , the last thing we need is another faction to add to the list . 
  all other turks in europe : stay strong , we know you 're not them . 
  quite a few of you have spoken out against this lunacy over the last couple of weeks , and we hear you . 
  you 'll always have a place here , do n't let anyone `` erdoganists '' and european xenophobes alike , tell you any different . 
  i was going to post a `` what year is this ?!, 
  '' - type comment as well . 
  if memory serves , the polish inquiry committee dropped the at the time widely popular/demanded plan to accuse the air traffic controllers after evaluating the flight data recorder ( s ) - especially the voice recorder . 
  they found no evidence to incriminate russian atc and plenty of evidence that the cockpit crew of the plane was put under extreme pressure to land by the pax . 
  i 'm not sure what the new evaluation now could have found in the same data that leads it to reach the opposite conclusion . 
  what a terrible , heinous act . 
  if the speculation that it was remotely denotnated devices holds true , also cowardly to boot . 
  my thoughts and prayers to the russian people , st. petersburgers especially . 
  for centuries , that city has been a beacon of civilization and culture , no matter how dark the world around it had gotten . 
  long may it remain so . 
  i personally would n't be surprised if this turns out to have been another depravity in the name of islam . 
  the people from the various ` stans of the ex-ussr who have flocked to the banners of isis provide the largest group of non-arab recurits by far . 
  and that 's not counting chechens , though there has been quite some noise about the comparatively extreme methods employed by russia/kadyrow keeping the chechen threat in particular pretty well contained over the last decade or so . 
  when i talked to a native russian with close ties to the homeland in the aftermath of the metrojet incident , they said that the russian people were basically already braced for more jihadi violence and waiting for the next shoe to drop with something like grim , fatalistic determination . 
  i 'll keep my fingers crossed that whoever is responsible will be found swiftly , and am in this context not alltogether sad that russia has a slightly different approach to dealing with that caliber of perps than the west . 
  stay strong st. petersburg - ` druschba ' from your friends in hamburg !, 
  every year i bloody agonize over the cost ( both in decent ingredients and time ) and general hassle of making stollen in the first place . 
  three weeks later , first bite of the first slice : * ` totally worth it - ca n't wait for next year !, 
  uk : mcvitie 's digestives chocolate & orange spain : turron in general , though the soft * jijon * variant in particular . 
  nearly any country other than germany : mint ice cream, 
  man , this entire thing reads like the nonsensical off-topic rants you 'll routinely get from the resident ultra-leftie during foreign policy seminars at university . 
  jesus h. christ , british reactionaries - this is n't the 16th , 18th , 19th or 20th century - knock it off with the bloody naval scares to pacify domestic unrest and unite the common rabble against a foreign foe . 
  at the rate this is going , some tory nitwit is bound to dig up thayer mahan again and next thing you know , we 're in a real pickle for no damn reason at all , our collective enemies laughing from the sidelines , hard at work deciding who to pick off first . 
  kamerad , we must polder like noone ever poldered before !, 
  first we 'll send a call to the dutch to help us with their know-how . 
  once the land is established , we 're gon na ask around france if there are any protestants ( left ) who would like to come on over and we should be good to go . 
  if the austrians got busy poldering in the south , we might take over that land to run it more efficiently , then again - to each his own . 
  it appears my lot is collectively 12 years old . 
  this ai n't gon na fly should the bear ever gets serious about knocking at our collective door , guys . 
  ai n't that the truth . 
  i was seriously considering posting a couple of passive-aggressive comments about the general juvenility of my fellow huns in apropriate threads , but it 's half past three now so - bundesliga !, 
  i personally really would n't mind a closer union , mate - but a very significant proportion of your fellow contrymen still thinks we 're the antichrist . 
  talk to them first , an when you guys have made up your mind , we 'll see what we can do . 
  whenever your trust in the human race or the world at large wavers , read adams or pratchett and come to realize it 's all relative . 
  welcome to the wonderful world of [ multiverse theory ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/multiverse ) , my friend !, 
  my personal favorite take on it is that of the late great [ terry pratchett ] ( https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/multiverse ) :  a universe is a small thing by comparison , as it contains only the sum totality of any * one * chain of causal events . 
   a multiverse could perhaps best be described as `` everything ''  [ ... ]  everything is ... well , everything . 
  not just the things that we perceive are , from our lowly vantage point , of only being able to see and act in three dimensions of space and what we perceive to be one-way linear time . 
  it contains * everything * that is , was , will be , and more importantly * all the mights and maybes * . 
  things and events that we might distantly speculate about , or that we wonder might have happened if events had played out a bit differently ... and where else would the centers of the multiverse be than in europe , where our very own motto is `` united in diversity '' ? 
  c'mon mate - i know the other `` greenies '' wo n't be bothered too much by that kind of statement , but let 's not give our polish friends an aneurysm in these times of hightened bilateral tension . 
   seriously though - pretty sure green 's supposed to be * mitteleuropa * . 
  now i need to ask myself again why i continue to not see various combinations of at least half of the green states as such , depending on the context of whatever political discussion i 'm currently engaged in at the time . 
  i 'm gon na let you in on a little secret mate : the true saying is n't  * `` hamburg - germany 's gate to the world !, 
  '' * but rather  * `` hamburg - center of the universe !, 
  my pleasure . 
  one of the hands-down best parts of working with these people is having a chance to get some first-hand knowledge , a quick fact-check or at least opinions/general sentiment straight from the source , without going through various levels of media/interest groups/politicians/educators with their multitude of biases and agendas . 
  i 'm routinely learning as much from them as they do from me . 
  okay , thre is berlin , of course , and munich and ... frankfurt ? 
  i assume hamburg got the axe because of it 's well known anglophilia ? 
  all correct , though i 'd like to add that even * with * public pressure , certain things that appear to the governmental apparatus as inherently complicated/laborious to pull off or with little direct payoff will get shelved indefinitely , even tough the mid - to long term payoff would be well worth the undertaking . 
  case in point of the day : [ recalling or - basing german forces currently in turkey ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article163233228/die-bundeswehr-hat-acht-alternativen-zur-tuerkei.html ) overhelming public support for a cessation of the `` turkey engagement '' of the bundeswehr ( first with the missile defense units , then inclusing the air reconnaissance element ) has been evident for years now and is a recurrent topic in the mainstream media . 
  turkey keeps using german troops as a pawn in various demostic - and bilateral power games . 
  re-basing is not only feasible but would pay off with a more stable operative environment in the immediate future , the costs are comparatively negligible , plus it would be a boost to the administration 's public profile on turkey . 
  but it takes a bit of effort to pull off and you 're guaranteed to see the usual pathologically `` anti-militarist '' crowd emerge to reflexively criticise anything broadly military-related on principle alone , who would then commandeer public discourse for at least a short while ( as is wont to happen in any german discourse broadly related to security policy ) so is it * really * worth the effort ? 
  * really * really ? 
  not to any `` merkel '' administration anyway . 
  would n't have happened under * schwarz-gelb * either . 
  it 's the [ * ciiiiiiiircle of liiiiiiiiiife * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zlx_jtcqvi ) !, 
  that 's the man !, 
  not even remotely my club , but i 've somehow always had a soft spot for him . 
  great footballer , seems to be a good person off the pitch as well .
