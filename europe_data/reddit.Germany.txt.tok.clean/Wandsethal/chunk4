  i agree with your general sentiment on the basis of the facts you rightly pointed out , mate . 
  that being said though , the german pollsters in particular have had a somewhat rocky history with predicting the afd correctly ahead of elections . 
  especially in the early years of the party , up to and including regional elections in 2016 . 
  what 's more - i should , in all fairness , have included * `` and especially the people who report on/quote their data '' * when saying `` the german pollsters '' though , because worse and with more of an impact than the pure `` number crunchers '' are in many ways the media and various lobby groups ( including the parties themselves ) who misrepresent or hold back polling trends that negatively impact their personal preferred narrative - here 's a very interesting recent [ article on the phenomenon ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.deutschlandfunk.de%2fwahlergebnis-im-saarland-viele-medien-sind-auf-die-letzten.694.de.html%3fdram%3aarticle_id%3d382360&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) . 
  when , on top of that , you factor in aspects like the [ spiral of silence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiral_of_silence ) and related social concepts and penomena , you can see how they are harder to get accurate numbers on than `` established parties '' , or shall we rather say `` parties against the support of which there is no dominant normative consensus in society '' . 
  plus there 's the fact that there seems to be some evidence pointing in the direction of there being at least a significant subsection of afd supporters that are considering purposely lying about their intended vote in order to lull the `` mainstream media '' / public opinion shapers into a false sense of security as to the parties ' general appeal . 
  their wager is that less additional potential voters are gained by rising poll numbers than there would be gained if societal pressure against afd were to ease ( or at least not further increase ahead of the election ) which in their eyes can/will only happen if the opinion shapers and media perceive afd to be less of a threat/less supported by the general population than they actually are . 
  how prevalent of a trend among afd-likely voters that is i can not say with any authority , however . 
  there is non-negligible evidence for such tactics being discussed online and on grassroots party level , but the `` threat '' of this happening might also be blown out of proportion by overly vigilant ( read : borderline hysterical ) afd-critics from the other side of the political divide . 
  indeed they were !, 
  somewhat wonky phrasing on my part yesterday ( should have included * `` and especially the people who bring the pollsters ' data to the public '' * ) , but in case you 're interested in my reasoning behind this statement , you 'll find a little more background on the german situation specifically in another reply to a different redditor in this subtread . 
  wow . 
  i do n't even - wow . 
  well , let 's wait and see how things stand after september - should we , by some great calamity of the universe , end up with a center-left/hard-left/eco-left coalition government , i 'm sure the eco left will get the environmental ministry and they certainly have the people and proclivity for wholistic conspiracy theories to pull this off . 
  we do , however , have a number of regular members of parliament , both in the bundestag as well as on state level , who regularily make official chemtrail inquiries . 
  one of the most notorious ones is a dude from merkel 's own cdu , belive it or not . 
  and thirty silver rubles go to the venerable comrade col. dalmau for sowing doubt and discontent into the hearts of the nato-eu-homogay enemies of mother russia - keep up the good work , fellow travellers !, 
  that is certainly part of the explanation , yes . 
  purely going by personal anecdotes drawing from both , the german muslims i personally know and those refugees i had as students in my integration/language classes , the giving of alms/charity as one of the fundamental pillars of islam is a big driving force to donate time , goods , money , a place at the family table during holidays ( chiefly * eid * if i recall correctly ) and so on . 
  especially the aspect of * zakat * , which i was given to understand is not so much voluntary as an implicit obligation to give a certain percentage of one 's own wealth ( unless one is too poor ) and restricted to helping other muslims specifically , is taken very seriously and the `` refugee crisis '' a welcome chance to actually see an immediate personal impact of one 's donation . 
  especially here in germany , where even the poorest people in one 's own community are comparatively well off compared to the really destitute in significant parts of the muslim world . 
  while * sadaka * seems to be more comparable with the general western definition of charity ( give however much you want to only if you want to , though it is encouraged to donate in general ) and can go to anyone as long as they have never fought against islam/hurt or harmed muslims - there was disagreement among my students wether or not this is limited to people who personally fought muslims largely regardless of context ( say , an afghanistan veteran or a german neonazi ) or extends to people who are culturally/historically tied to those enemies of islam , like , say , any descendants of crusaders , which would generally exclude most westerners . 
  * dude * , just you wait - our very own counterpart to your bloke , recently-initiated foreign minister sigmar gabriel is a walking , talking international faux-pas waiting to happen . 
  as soon as someone holds a microphone in front of his face , his brain takes a vacation !, 
  we 've only enjoyed the pleasures of his countless little cringe-scapades domestically so far , but now we 're ready to share him with the world !, 
  sorry for butting in here late ( bz for all-round great posts on this issue on your part ) but this is n't a redditor being obnoxious - that 's really a pretty decent redditor from what i 've seen of them across the boards - rather than a textbook example of how the vast majority of germans utterly lack the predisposition , skill-set and knowledge to think geostrategically , especially in terms of security policy . 
  if we 've ever had it on a broad societal level , it is not only long gone but you have virtually no notion of even lacking one , unless you notice that other societies routinely have conversations ( in ways that ) we do n't . 
  i liked him better when he still played for dortmund .

  sorry mate - i 'm entirely unable to make myself understood tonight , do n't know why . 
  i 'm actually with you on all counts in both , personal opinion and neutral analysis . 
  my big gripe with fdp is that while they absolutely had it in themselves to be exactly that party , they * completely * dropped the ball in the broader security - as well as immigration/integration policy field since they got kicked out of parliament . 
  and apart from the very traditional ( old school * sozialliberale * ) left wing of the party , the non-h\u00f6cke-afd like notions regarding the immigration/assimilation debate , with a keen interest in adopting/refining best practices from traditional immigrant societies ( mostly us and canada ) were what this inner-fdp discourse was about . 
  i 'm not a party member , but i 've done a university-related internship with an fdp member of the bundestag during the late * merkel ii * cabinet , who had a chair in both the education and foreign policy commission / * ausschuss * and happened to be up for local ( inner-party ) reelection that same year . 
  so i 've seen a heck of a lot of the inner-fdp stance and debate on those issues , in a comparatively short time frame . 
  which is exactly why i am so surprised that the post-2013 fdp with nothing to lose did n't capitalize on the opening the `` refugee crisis '' brought with it . 
  i 've since well and truly lost touch with any up-to-date inner goings-on of the fdp , but my best guess as to the reason for why they did n't fill that field ( with their own broadly majority position , nontheless ! ), 
  is the fact that they are so * utterly * petrified of the reaction of the press/lobby-driven public forum towards a critical position , that they decided to cower in fear rather than advertise and defend their policy . 
  which is * intellectually * understandable when you look at what they 've been through in the five-odd years before that ( and especially how that came about and by whom it was perpetuated ) , but in principle deserves absolutely no pity/sympathy : if a party is intrinsically unable to support its ' own policy , it may as well dissolve . 
  so in summary , i 'm all for a party on the german ( center - ) right that helps bring about a ` normal ' , pluralistic democratic debate open to the full spectrum of public opinion in this country - as you say , it is sorely needed . 
  i just do n't see any chance that even a ` reborn ' / salvaged afd can be that party , even without it 's fringe element . 
  the h\u00f6cke-crowd / putinists compromised its ' core integrity too greatly from within , while public ( ated ) opinion turned it into too much of a red ( or rather : brown ) rag to ever allow it to be seen as something else in polite society . 
  socio-economically , absolutely yes . 
  in pretty much * all * other policy fields though , decidedly not . 
  since the big pull factor of the spd ( to the vast majority of gremans , this goes for both * volksparteien * of course ) in terms of ( self ) identification has always been in that arena of policy , these tend to get overlooked . 
  in regards to national security , international security/defense , migration/integration , education , energy policy , ecology/agriculture etc. , the spd did n't only * not * move to the right of where they were under where * schr\u00f6der i * rooted them in the 1998 party-program , they actually drifted further to the left in order to curb the rise of the newly-renamed linke under lafontaine or contest/catch up with the ever-more-popular greens on their own turf . 
  this was in large parts driven not so much by the national / * bundes * - spd , which shot itself not just in the foot but pretty much in the head by being the party that implemented the * agenda * - but by the federal / * landes * - spd in the states ; which by and large used left-drifting policies : * as a ` propaganda ' / credibility tool to underline their relative independence of the `` evil '' federal mother party in front of their * agenda * - disenfranchised traditional supporters ( locally , the cdu tended to follow the left-drift of merkel on the national level - motivation not really clear , assumed to be ` it works for her so never change a winning formula ' - a * lot * of sub-national cdu campaigns ran and * won * by heavily invoking merkel 's national popularity on the federal and even local level ) * to clearly define/contrast their traditional policy fields against the left-drifting cdu in the many various spd/cdu state-level government coalitions of the last 15 years * towards the linke and especially the booming greens in the way they did in non-socio-economic policy fields on the federal level as outlined above . 
  ** edit : various clarifications throughout - sorry , kind of scatterbrained tonight it seems . 
  my pleasure , mate . 
  yes , very good point - i actually added that into my absolute mess of a post ( 4 + edits and i ca n't even blame that on being drunk or the dog distracting me , good grief ) but i 've either not made that clear enough , or you 've been by before i managed to squeeze it in . 
   i agree with you - the room for such a party is definitely there , though it remains to be seen what will happen to the cdu ( my bet : it ` implodes ' post-schr\u00f6der-spd style ) once merkel leaves the helm within the next 4 years max . 
  i 'm afraid afd have missed that mark though , between the putin-financed putsch from the wingnuts and the 2 + years of media/public opinion campaign against those three letters and what they now stand for as a party . 
  i 've had a long , hard , close-up look at the afd as it first constituted itself - when the meat of its ' policy postions was basically the right-centrist wing of fdp , predominantly made up of people disgruntled by the compromises fdp was making to their `` liberal dna '' in their government coalition with merkel and stuffed to the gills with academics and other traditionally non-political , non-activist types : the early-lucke-afd , who had their heyday over the course of the bailout crisis around 2014 . 
  i subsequently voted for them in that year 's european election ( 2014 ) when they ran on a ticket of , among other policies : * full equal rights for homosexuals/legalization of gay marriage ; legalization of assisted suicide ; a sensible , long term migration policy on the basis of a ` canadian ' / us immigration system ; a sensible sustainable fiscal policy for europe - outcome to be determined through pluralistic inter-european debate , no options off the table * i like to tell people i ( once ) voted afd as sort of a twisted party trick now , just to see them flip their shit at me , or suffer a strong bout of cognitive dissonance when they 're unable to square myself and who they know me to be with what they have now internalized as `` the afd '' in its ' current mutation . 
  it 'll be interesting to see if the german pollsters do better than their pre-brexit counterparts in the uk , or the entire `` policy wonk establishment '' in the us . 
  that being said , the current downward trend is unsurprising . 
  the * dramatis personae * of afd are overwhelmingly hard to digest for the average german voter on their own terms , even before people are influenced by the media/public discourse/the spiral of silence etc. 
  as soon as the `` refugess crisis '' became a subject open to constructive policy debate among the political establishment and especially in the `` main stream media '' ( not used as a buzzword here - i 'm specfically excluding foreign media and fringe publications where pluralistic opinions could be found from the get-go in 2015 ) , it was clear that afd would lose ground again . 
  on a somewhat relate note : a large part of the meteoric rise of schulz was/is due to a hype-bubble ( for lack of a better word ) created by the traditionally left-leaning , traditionally merkel-critical german media establishment who are not so much thrilled with schulz the spd-apparatshik of the eu 's socialist-nomenklatura for his own sake , as they were just relived that there was now * any * feasible alternative to merkel ( who they had been forced to back in the face of an increasing wave of public dissent to her `` refugee crisis '' stance as a matter of principle ) as chancellor . 
  it 'll be interesting to see what happens when both , the media and the spd catch on to that . 
  we 'll see by mid-may at the latest , though i would n't be wholly surprised if we/they might just be in for a surprise in lower saxony as well . 
  the traditional/established parties that they 've taken votes from in the first place - pretty much everyone , and it very much depends : when afd first showed up until the wingnuts on the right usurped it ( 2012-2014 / early ' 15 ) , that was mostly liberals ( european sense of the word - their german home is fdp ) and cdu voters and a few spd supporters who were fundamentally against the `` big southern european bailout '' - related policy their traditional parties declared to be without alternative . 
  well , cdu and spd did - fdp , in a coalition with cdu at the time , went along kicking and screaming , but along they went , but that 's an aside . 
  after 2015 , they drew disgruntled voters from all parties ( including a small number of greens , which puzzled the journalists/politics wonks mightily and continues to do so to this day - they have virtually nothing in common with what had been commonly proven to be the green voting block ) but especially mobilized non-voters of every color . 
  as cdu and spd are the biggest parties and spd looked destined to field a particularly appalling candidate for chancellor ; while cdu has traversed so far to the left under merkel that they are , programmatically , now where spd used to be 15 years ago , the bulk of those new supporters were originally ( once upon a time , before they became non-voters ) cdu/spd voters . 
  in the wake of the `` refugee crisis '' , they capitalized substantially on what are called single issue voters - people who determine who gets their vote based on a single ( or very narrowly defined field ) policy issue and the respective parties ' stance on said issue . 
  not to be confused with clientelist parties and their corrsponding voters ( german domestic example : eco-progressives vote green , a substancial body of ex-gdr inmates and dyed-in-the-wool leftists vote linke , upper-middle-class urbanites vote fdp ) , single issue voters tend to come from all walks of life and previous party affiliation and will congregate to vote for a new party when the specific issue that drives them has either become so important to them that it overshadows all other policy fields , or is under - or unrepresented by most/all other parties . 
  what afd decidedly does n't do is simply pool votes from smaller right-wing parties that would n't have made it past the 5 % threshold otherwise . 
  they do collect a substantial amount of what few votes these parties always drew , but the * bulk * of popular afd support are , emphatically , not heretofore `` undiscovered '' wingnuts , but a bunch of average-joe germans from the entire ( established ) political spectrum - linke , greens , spd , cdu , fdp . 
  we 're going to see - especially in the wake of rutte in the netherlands pulling off what is considered a de-facto victory against the odds - the established parties claiming to support policies a fair bit tougher on adversaries like erdogan and on the issue of post - `` refugee crisis '' migration policy in particular , than what has been their line from 2015 until arguably late fall 2016/the berlin attack . 
  my personal wager is that this will be enough to lure the brunt of single issue voters back to their respective traditional parties , maybe over to another traditional competitor , should they prove more/most ` authentic ' in that regard - but certainly away from afd . 
  it will be interesting to see what of that new tough line will actually get implemented post-election when the usual suspects are in the saddle again , as especially the greens and the spd are going against their innermost convictions ( and well-established lobbies and special interest groups - there are massive numbers of portential voters , many prospective party members and substancial donors there ) with the current notion of `` tough talk/clear rules/promotion of assimilation over laissez-faire multiculturalism '' ** edit : clarification , last paragraph summary ** ** 2nd edit : additional info in 3rd paragraph ** ** 5th ( ?

  just you wait until the real nasty diseases strike their precious brood - they 'll howl twice as loud for for fast-tracking all manner of state-sponsored inclusion programs then . 
  to me personally , the most infuriating thing about the whole mess is the fact that they are forcing their whimsical delusions on someone who does n't ave a voice in the matter yet . 
  if it were their * own * immunization , i 'd say ` fine , let mother nature 's selective process work its ' magic ' but these people are screwing over the people who simply do n't have a choice themselves - their children before they can act on their own behalf as well as the tiny minority of people with severe enough health problems that their lives depend on the herd immunity of the overwhelming rest of the population . 
  so , prague has about what , 60-ish percent czech citizens ?

  the day that wanker drove through the berlin christmas market , i phoned up the one friend presently in town and went to one of the bigger ones in hamburg . 
  they did n't play any music , but the people were n't deterred . 
  the only tangible change was people actively nodding - and smiling at the solitary police patrol present - cops are otherwise just benignly ignored here . 
  always , mate . 
   and sorry about podolski tonight - i know it 's tradition that you smash us in the friendlies , but this was his last outing for the mannschaft and what not . 
  hope you understand . 
  next non-tournament game will be 5:1 for you lot again , we promise !, 
  god , i am so sick of this shit , i am running out of appropriate things to say in reply to acts like this one . 
  thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families , of course . 
  thoughts and salutes to all leos ( and soldiers/militia , as we 've last seen in france , though also remembering the poor squaddie of the royal fusiliers they tried to behead a few years ago ) everywhere , who not only put their lives on the line to save innocents in such situations , but are increasingly favorite targets of the delusional perps themselves . 
  i 'll drink a dram in honor of british spirit and steadfastness tonight - beastly as these acts of terror are , our brothers across the channel are made of sterner stuff than the cowardly reprobates who carry out ( and celebrate , let 's not kid ourselves - those people are legion , too ) these delusional acts of inhumanity . 
  my thoughts exactly , mate . 
  i was used to prejudice from my time in the us , but that was mostly based on a uniformly prevalent lack of information/cultural obliviousness : `` this is a dvd player ! '', 
  `` do you guys have mobile phones ? 
  '' , `` are you still mad at jews ? '', 
  `` you used to go to war all the time , why do n't you support us in iraq ?! '', 
  that type of thing . 
  easily remedied when you took the time to elucidate the american in question on what germany/germans are like these days . 
  and the americans were grateful for the correction , because they learned something new .
