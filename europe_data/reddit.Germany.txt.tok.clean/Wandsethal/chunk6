  anyone here with an informed opinion in that regard ? 
  edit : also mildy interesting to read that the repurposing of auctioned deactivated weapons appears to be on the up again for the last couple of years . 
  for the roughly two decades i 've read things broadly relating to the european illegal arms trade business , the cheapest/most practicable way to go about obtaining that kind of equipment in these numbers was the ex-warsaw pact route . 
  have we finally gotten a handle on the post-cold war `` eastern european arms swamp '' , then ? 
  * obama * had been saying the exact same thing for at least his entire second term . 
  only nobody outside the security policy community took note of it until around 2014/15 , and the ( especially european ) media only picked up on it in the late run-up to the us election last year .

  there 's always at least a little light among the darkness , right ? 
  very interesting , thanks for the link !, 
  my mom 's side of the family fled from around breslau to cologne in 45 , when my mom was an infant . 
  they lived on stadtwaldg\u00fcrtel , and i remember her stories of how she experienced the slow rebuilding of the inner city , though with my family not being originally from there , ist must have been even worse for the people who remembered what the city looked like before the 50s and 60s architectural molestation . 
  i 've talked to a lot of old hamburgers over the years ( the pain was and is very much real for these people ) and seen tons of photos of places i know like the back of my hand , but could hardly square the images of what these streets and plazas looked like 70-odd years ago and what they 've become now . 
  i 'm gon na link my mom to your video anyways - though she 's been in hamburg since the 60s herself , seeing stuff from cologne always makes her smile . 
  well , same in hamburg really - which is why it 's such a damn disgrace that they have been/are so zealously going for the very few buildings that we 've ( had ) left . 
  hamburg specifically still destroyed a shit-ton of perfectly fine * gr\u00fcnderzeit * and sometimes even older buildings just to give overzealous citiy-planners and spd-friendly architects something to play with , who made a point of replacing it with whatever was the budget version of currently en-vogue contemporary style . 
  the last really big howler was tearing down not just the building but also the [ historic facade ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/hamburg-der-eingang-zum-europahaus-im-ballindamm-ber-dem-der-links-picture-id542921497 ) of what is now the [ europapassage ] ( http://www.allianz-realestate.com/files/6813/3352/0147/content_europapassage.jpg ) , about 15 years ago , thus needlessly destoying the mostly intact turn-of-the-century ensemble of facades on that side of * binnenalster * lake . 
  do n't i know it . 
  here are some pics ( in color ! ), 
  of what pre wwii northern-germany ( and berlin ) looked like : [ hamburg - boulevard along lake alster ] ( http://img.abendblatt.de/img/nachrichten/crop206753067/509260350-w820-cv16_9-q85/200a-germany-1900-photochroms-xl-01137-a94eaf92-42fa-492b-9dc7-f8fc3e6f07ef.jpg ) [ hamburg - another view of the same place taken from 500m to the left of last pic 's frame ] ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-914580-galleryv9-losk-914580.jpg ) [ hamburg - speicherstadt \\ ( now a unesco world heritage site \\ ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/die_speicherstadt_in_hamburg-altstadt,_hier_der_sandthorquai_\\ ( ca . _ 1900 \\ ) . jpg ) [ bremen - historic merchant guild house and surrounding architecture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/schuetting_bremen_1900.jpg ) [ danzig - krantor , now gdansk poland , who did a great job restoring the historical surroundings ] ( http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-914582-galleryv9-rkps-914582.jpg ) [ berlin - hallesches tor 1900 ] ( http://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berlin-1900-2015/img/1900/halleschestor.jpg?v1 ) which is now [ this abomination ] ( http://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berlin-1900-2015/img/2015/halleschestor.jpg?v1 ) [ greifswald - restored inner city market place ] ( http://bdh-klinik-greifswald.de/wassets-bdh-klinik-greifswald/img/umgebung/07panorama_marktplatz_1.jpg ) [ rendsburg - old city market with old school on the left ] ( http://www.deutsche-schutzgebiete.de/webpages/rendsburg_altstaedter_markt.jpg ) edit : one more - you can see the typical north-german red brick architectural style of the rendsburg school house or hamburg speicherstadt reflected in the old [ k\u00f6nigsberg cathedral ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/kaliningradkatedra13.jpg/440px-kaliningradkatedra13.jpg ) and many other religious - and profane buildings ( [ german naval academy ] ( http://www.wolkenmond.de/foto/unterwegs/2010/08/13/dsc_8987.jpg ) in flensburg and old and current [ synagogue in berlin rykestrasse ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/berlin_synagoge_rykestrasse_eingang.jpg ) for example ), 
  still as bad as mid last month , or is this a new bout of inversion weather ? 
  i 'll keep my fingers crossed for some wind to blow you way soon . 
  and how 's the weather in st. petersburg today ? 
  they are super tactical . 
  they are so tactical , you wo n't even see them . 
  you 'll think they are n't even there , it 's true . 
  and so will the danes . 
  and the moment they let down their guard * * whack !, 
  * * tactical broomstick , right between the blocks . 
  do n't get too excited , europeeps - let 's wait five minutes ( aka the time it takes the three generals to leave the room and bannon to reenter ) , he 's probably gon na wan na nuke us then . 
  this . 
  on top of that , both mattis and mcmaster ( ca n't speak with any authority on kelly as i do n't know him nearly as well in that regard , but he 's a confidante of mattis and mattis is pretty awesome ) are absolute pro-nato realists , who know and value their european partners a great deal . 
  they are about as far away from blinkered ideologues and/or dumb military aparatchiks as any men with their vitae could possibly ever be . 
  extremely well read , proven to be great proponents of constructive thinking , haters of groupthink , not afraid to speak truth to power . 
  mcmaster also spent a few years of his earlier career stationed/living in europe . 
  they are very well respected , if not actually adored by the sensible , largely nonpartisan part of the american/greater western security policy community . 
  i , for one - though by no means an expert - could n't be happier with them in the positions they are holding . 
  hands down the single winning aspect of the trump administation so far . 
  from a european - and sensible global security policy perspective , that is . 
  no worries , mate . 
  i get what you 're feeling , mostly because it 's a pretty familiar notion , mostly due to how german history is taught in germany these days . 
  you get a lot of people who have no particularily deep interest in history in the first place , but who remember what they got taught in school/happens to be the popular general perception of events at the moment , which makes just enough sense for them to not question that narrative , seek more information or another angle . 
  and then they go around , proudly proclaiming it to be the gospel truth , when oftentimes history is a fair bit more complicated than that . 
  you certainly had a valid , senior-as-heck claim on schleswig , but the general upheaval the 19th century screwed you over , like it did so much of europe . 
  populism , national consciousness and self-determination really did n't allow for pretty much feudal practices like the treaty of ribe solution for the duchies to carry on into the modern era . 
  we should all be glad it was solved in just two comparatively small wars and a peaceful referendum - just look at the royal mess the balkans were and continue to be , or how much bloodshed and destruction of property it took to put poland on the map again and settle its current borders . 
  so really - no offence taken , and let me assure you that i will certainly never venture to marginalize denmark 's historial achievements in both , warfare and peace . 
  good man , good point . 
  have an upvote !, 
  get outta here with your truths and comprehensible explanations !, 
  it 'll be hard enough as it is when we eventually go tits-up with the rest and wonder how the hell that could happen , what with us claiming to still embody the [ prussian virtues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_virtues ) while having quietly switched to rhenish-southwestern hedonism , decadence and pharisaism and all . 
  huh , did n't think of that !, 
  well , we get a lot of it and it really is some fantastic bacon . 
  i remember being slightly surprised by coming to the `` homeland of all things bacon '' and continuously thinking `` well , this is good stuff , but not really any better than the danish bacon in germany ! '' . 
  except for the hickory smoked stuff . 
  you guys ca n't match the us there - but then again , neither can we , nor anyone else in europe . 
  well , that thinking made a lot of sense - denmark had the swedish-norwegian exeditionary force for the war in ' 48 , which was , to the best of my knowlege , still in the early years of the pan-scandinavianism movement , compared to ' 64 . 
  i 'm perpetually amazed how the scandinavian nations managed to put the whole late - and post-napoleonic mess of affiliations and ownership of norway behind them in a mere generation and forged such amiable ties . 
  three brothers indeed . 
  that was an amazingly close vote - also good to hear that there is still new research being done with the public taking an interest !, 
  i ca n't tell you how sad it makes me that this is n't so much the case in germany . 
  the best/most thorough german-language works on the era are mostly all pre-wwii . 
  and even the real big events get kind of swept under the rug here , even on anniversaries : the 200th anniversary of both , the battle of nations and the battle of waterloo produced next to no interesting new german literature and went by largely unnoticed by the general public . 
  which is a shame , because that period is really the nucleus of the german unification movement . 
  but pretty early on ( 2010ish ) when the interesed parties of britain and the benelux states first started to inquire about joint educational/remebrance/celebration projects with their german counterparts , the french ( who are neurotically intolerant when it comes to the historical assesment of napoleon ) threw an epic tantrum and germany , of course , immediately caved in and engaged in a bare minimum of anglo-austro-benelux-german projects . 
  anyway . 
  i 'll be keeping my eye out for german or english translation of the new material regarding the schleswig war , though - many thanks for the pointer !, 
  why mess with a tried and tested combo , right ? 
  sounds lovely , the slight tart of the apricot surely works a treat !, 
  extremely interesting , many thanks for the concise summary . 
  never quite realized how much of the netherlands was such a , shall we call it `` permanent building site '' ( german * dauerbaustelle * is , as a term , a bit more apt ) . 
  bold , ingenious engineering on your part , especially the attitude behind it is admirable . 
  in light of all that , you 're welcome to some land - though anything at your immediate border is a bit crowded and will , i 'm afraid , mostly remain so for . 
  we do have some very lovely , broadly similar land on our other border , though - i 'm sure you 'd love mecklenburg/north brandenburg , after all , you 've helped cultivate brandenburg/prussia before , and those of your ancestors that decided to stay built some of the nicest housing in [ postdam ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/holl%c3%a4ndisches_viertel ) , back in the day . 
  so how about it ? 
  there are currently still a few germans around in the northeast , but they are slowly dying out . 
  in 50 years ' time , it will be mostly wolves . 
   councillors in [ kassel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kassler ) , in the central hesse region , want the event 's organisers to ditch its veggie theme and allow stalls to sell popular regional sausages , [ ... ]  `` this is an issue that is close to people 's hearts , and for that reason it is of course something we ca n't ignore in local politics , '' said dominique [ kalb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veal ) , mayoral candidate for the conservative cdu party [ ... ]  the greens abstained from voting and their candidate , eva [ koch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cook_\\ ( profession \\ ) ) , suggested people should n't get too worked up over sausages and the final paragraph is this beauty :  while some may welcome the vegetarian offerings , others are voting with their feet . 
  the local senior citizens ' advisory council says it can not abide the lack of sausages , and wo n't be attending the event . 
  people of europe , the bloody bbc is trolling ( [ ering ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollinger ) ) us . 
  well , do n't just stand here - * get to it * , my good man !, 
  this just in :  today , austria introduced a * three euro coin * which also * glows in the dark * , its ' design features such typical indigenous animals as * tigers , crocodiles , parrots and lobsters * , among others . 
  wait , * what the fuck * did i just read ?!, 
   today , ** austria ** introduced ... nevermind . 
  carry on . 
  to be completely fair ( and no disrespect to the children of pilsudski ) , they were kind of busy killing , starving , incarcerating , torturing and paranoidly surveiling a good part of their own population at the same time . 
  and they did n't have the americans throwning a shit-ton of money and materiel at them in support of their war either . 
  genius . 
  while you 're at it , you should take half of each poulation and cram them together into [ slavonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavonia ) as well , nobody will know how to sort that mess until the end of the world . 
  yeah , sorry , i need a better map . 
  you know , a tactical map - or at least a proper strategic one . 
  looking at this map , all i get is * `` luxembourg apparently wants to build an atomic reactor and blow it up so luxembourg proper is wiped off the face of the earth , everything within the red circle becomes a radioactive no-go-zone for the next century , and due to complex weather patterns i 'm too dumb to understand , the red-hued countries will become severely contaminated by the fallout , while the grey-hued countries remain mostly okay . 
  the bulk of the fallout speads predominantly along the lines indicated by the big red arrows . 
  '' * edit : you 'll have my upvote for an a + plan for european atomic annihilation , though . 
  we shall call it the european samson option in case brexit , the next few elections and/or the european refugee rodeo go bad . 
  by all means - anything that pisses off the german greens gets full marks in this kraut 's win column . 
  i knew you guys were my favorite neighbors for a reason !, 
  til - thanks , mate !, 
  very ineresting facts i was completely oblivious about until now , but it makes a lot of sense . 
  do you get the latent structural problems of shifting soil and unstable foundations/sinking/tilting , fissures etc. 
  as well , or are the deep foundations enough to keep that at bay ?
