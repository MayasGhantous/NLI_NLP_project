  extremely thought provoking , at times uplifting , at times despairing reading . 
  now , polandbros - from one * berliner * nation to another - we all know the real , still unaswered questions here : 1 . what are the traditional fillings ? 
  2 . what are the currently most popular fillings ? 
  3 . are there regional differences in filling-preference ? 
  4 . what 's * your * favorite filling ? 
  5 . are there fillings that are an absolute no-go ? 
  if so , which ones ? 
  6 . what is the secret behind good * paczki * , the filling or the dough ? 
  ( questions open to all other [ non ] europeans with similar treats as well , of course ) edit : totally forgot to answer my own damn question , sorry - here goes : 1 . multi-fruit jam , raspberry jam , strawberry jam , plum jam ( spiced ) , according to legend : apple jam in the german southwest 2 . multi-fruit jam , then apparently a lot of fillings with booze : champagne truffle cream , whiskey cream , advocaat/eggnog , tequila and lime etc. 
  top contender in my neck of the woods seems to be the whiskey cream one for a few years running now 3 . according to ~ ~ legend ~ ~ several non-northerners among my friends , apple-jam filling seems to be a mainstay in southern/south western germany . 
  i remember that until the 2000s , there used to be , at best , three different fillings to chose from : one was multi-fruit , one was n't , the third was plum jam . 
  whiskey cream , hands down . 
  do n't skimp on the whiskey , though . 
  * berliner * - filling appears to have become an anything-goes competition in the big german cities these days , so there are ruffled feathers whomever you ask . 
  personally , there is a f * cking [ hugo ] ( http://monkeysandmountains.com/drink-in-germany-hugo-cocktail ) - berliner around , the very existence of which absolutely irks my inner hipster . 
  never had it though . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , the dough must be fluffy and i do n't mind tasting just a hint of the frying fat if it 's decent , fresh fat . 
  the filling should n't be overly sweet and there should be a good amount of it . 
  also , glac\u00e9 icing beats the pants off powdered sugar , which is just messy . 
  hold your horses - there 's also * nanzig * , * genf * , * mischkolz * and * f\u00fcnfkirchen * , as well as a few others . 
  this map simply uses german town names for any cities we have them for - regardless of wether or not they are historical german towns . 
  we do n't call mailand * milano * , florenz * firenze * and prag * praha * either . 
  of course he would say that . 
  does n't want to give up thoe sweet , sweet ipa billions . 
  mostly run by their professors who chase them down the whole frankfurt school/postmodernism rabbithole in the first place , but if you take a closer look at their younger cohort and youth organization , you are bang on the money . 
  especially their under-40 segment , are indeed our equivalent to the american sjw cohort . 
  the direct ties of the linke to the ex-gdr are too strong to be a proper political home for anyone but the true belivers on the hard left , or those nostalgic for the ` good old times ' behind the iron curtain . 
  this here is the heart of the matter . 
  the educational policy of the greens has shown to be pretty disatrous in the mid - to long term in whatever german state it got implemented . 
  it a nutshell , it 's a hodgepodge of clichee left-progressive educational policies , but on steroids : heavy on promoting soft skills , inclusion , creating a `` level playing field '' ( mostly by excusing individual and collective shortcomings as the result of institutional racism/classism/sexism / ableism or other forms of systemic prejudice ) and the like , extremely costly in both money and manpower , while resulting in a general , quite significant drop in overall performance . 
  in nrw , even the teachers and intellectual petit bourgeoisie , who make up a large part of the absolute bedrock supporters of the greens , are fed up with the disastrous mess the greens have made of that field and have deserted their political home in droves for either cdu or fdp in this election . 
  prof. peterson sums it up pretty well : [ they are the same cohort as the post-soviet socialist middle class/intellectuals elsewhere in the world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvjotyzaw1u ) the greens `` siphoned those people off '' both the spd and the pds/linke and concentrated them in a seperate party . 
  eas between his discovery of the information and this ceremony possibly ? 
  i know you guys have pretty liberal regs concering the wearing of uniforms/awards after retiring from service , but perhaps the captain quit the army with a chip on his shoulder and decided to make a statement by wearing civvies ? 
  do n't forget us , man - von steuben did his part , too !, 
  that is an exceptionally generous offer , mate - at this point , i ca n't honestly say when i 'll finally get around to my big tour of poland ( certainly not this year ) , but i 'll give you a ping when the time comes . 
  nothing better than to get a feel for a city through the guiding eyes of a native . 
  please allow me to extend the same offer to you in regards of hamburg - i 'm there at the moment and for the forseeable future , though very likely not indefinitely . 
  in any case though - do hit me up when you come over , i 'd be happy to show you around/stand you a beer etc. 
  my pleasure , mate . 
  and i 'm with you when it comes to the absurdities inherent in our level of demilitarization - try being from hamburg , where we 've been governed by spd ( and spd-led coalitions ) for a total of 65 out of 73 years since the war - and do n't even have so much as an annual sch\u00fctzenfest / carnival tradition when it comes to preserving martial heritage . 
  i 've got what would `` internationally '' be classified as a passing interest in military music and managed to meet a grand total of about three other germans who share that interest over the course of the last threee decades . 
  whenever the fact comes out that they , too , like military music , i immediately grow suspicious/reasses them , thinking `` surely there must be something wrong with them ? '', 
  only to then promptly remember `` yeah , the same thing that 's ` wrong ' with you , retard ... '' !, 
  anyway - if you enjoyed the background info on the narhalla marsch , you might also enjoy this little bit of info : i 'm sure you 've , at least in passing , come across the magnificent amalgamation of music and lyrics that is the [ marines ' hymn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq8w7y3ohlc ) ? 
  they actually took the music from an 1860s jacques offenbach * operetta * genoveva von brabant ( genevi\u00e8vre de brabant ) , where it features as the [ gendarmes ' duet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fie3zmxwoo4 ) . 
  the original lyrics to that one are , of course , not just pretty funny but utterly hilarious when put into context with the usmc . 
  ever since i first came across this origin story , i 'm entirely unable to listen to the marines ' hymn with a completely straight face , no matter the kickass martial display that accompanies it . 
  i adore the marines ' esprit de corps and the displays they put on , but by `` when danger looms , we 're never there '' , i 'm routinely losing it . 
  awesome , many thanks for pointing these out to me !, 
  one more place i definitely need to visit in poland . 
  that prospective trip is slowly but surely shaping up to take the better part of a month and most likely will end up costing me an arm and a leg , but there is just so much great stuff to explore ... 
  spot on there , mate !, 
  two more things : the march actually is a fair bit older than its use in the mainzer carneval - it was actually part of a soon-forgotten early 19th century french opera , from which it got adapted for military music and was subsequently played a lot/became popular as a `` neutral '' ( as in : not written specifically for - or assigned to a specific regiment ) march to be used for a pass-in-review ( the proper german term is * defiliermarsch * ) . 
  also , the narhalla-marsch has become so utterly synonymous with german/rhenish/mainzian carnival sessions/meetings , the actual phrase/image of * `` tusch !, 
  '' * , or * `` fanfare , then play the narhallamarsch '' * has become a sort of tounge-in-cheek reply to utterly boring , trite and/or decidedly unfunny jokes/statements in general , underscoring the fact that everyone is aware of the fact that the previous statement/joke completely missed its mark . 
  so the actual use of the narhalla-marsch , of all musical pieces , by hallervorden in this context may actually be an attempt to play the same multi-faceted/meta-level joke game b\u00f6hmermann excells in . 
  knowing hallervorden and his usual level of comedic talent though , i 'd be surprised if he though that far . 
  as a northern european / northern german , i absolutely love places dominated by that type of predominantly red brick architecture . 
  a great many old places in the baltic region feature a lot of it , and have done so for much longer than my native hamburg , which has nontheless become a sort of archetypical example ( at least within germany itself ) for red brick-dominated cityscapes . 
  funnily enough , the new environmental laws and structural insulation craze/lobbyism/governmental subsidizing bonanza that has run rampant in germany over the last decade or so has done away with a lot of those very same trademark red brick buildings : the bricks are now buried beneath several layers of insulation and a thin veneer of either plaster , or differently-colored mock-bricks . 
  anyway , i 'm always happy to see other places that still show some pride in their wonderful ( historic ) red facades . 
  many thanks for sharing !, 
  one more voice to make the confusion complete : according to german sources , the town of * thorn * ( as well as the nearby [ castle of the same name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toru%c5%84_castle ) ) , first settlement of the * kulmerland * region of the teutonic order , was named afte the crusader fortress of [ toron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toron ) in the holy land , the ruins of which can be found in present-day lebanon . 
  the fortress changed hands quite a bit between crusaders and muslims and the german contribution to its defense/retaking was comparatively significant , as far as ( predominantly/exclusively ) german chivalric involvement at the time and in that region of the levant went . 
  name etymology and actual history of thorn/toru \u0144 is of course heavily contested even today ( though more of an issue in poland/to poles , as most contemporary germans have little to no interest in such matters ) , as is the case with many/most/all places , people and factoids pertaining to that particular region of europe . 
  mind sharing the backstory of this event ? 
  was he supposed to ride glorious turkmene horse and turkmene horse did n't like glorious leader ? 
  or do you guys have actual rodeos and i 've never been aware of it ? 
  also - why would the prime minister/president ( no idea when this took place ) participate in a rodeo * in a dress shirt and tie * ? 
  it he trying to one-up putin by doing the same activities , only better dressed ? 
  as long as it does n't end up looking like the pathetic mess saddam hussein turned babylon into , any and all efforts to preserve/restore palmyra should be greatly appreciated . 
  yes , it is . 
  extra fact : greifswald is the second oldest university in the baltic region/upper northern europe - the only one older is the university of rostock . 
  in soviet-america , black men shoot unarmed ~ ~ cops ~ ~ korans, 
  will do , thanks for the tip !, 
  i 'm kind of amazed that a * shotgun * , even a combat shotgun , can look this ( for lack of a better word ) `` sleek '' - the two , three of those i 've seen look very `` blocky '' in comparison . 
  i totally oscillated between assault rifle ( magazine too small ?! ), 
  and designated marksman rifle ( magazine size would work out but stock looks wrong , barrel too short , sights wrong ?! ) . 
  i guess it 's due to the small gauge . 
  the one/two type ( s ) of gun i 'm actually anywhere near familiar with are my dad 's hunting rifles - a combination gun ( different rifle calibers ) and a 12-gauge shotgun - i 've seen 20-gauge shells , but i guess i never really figured shotguns exist in calibers as small as .410 '' . 
  horses for courses i suppose , eh ? 
  i do love learning new stuff in that field , though . 
  you 've got ta be a believer i suppose - or someone utterly unable to fact-check pretty much anything . 
  one way to get rid of those pesky chechens i suppose : rile them up , see them off to join isis to fight ` the great satan ' , watch them be the rest of the world 's problem until they get smoked ; and pay that certified lunatic kadyrov a pittance to keep whoever is left behin in check . 
  nah man , that 's small-fry , chickenshit type stuff . 
  you 've lost your touch . 
  now , that time when you tried to make the world believe that america bio-engineered hiv/aids to subjugate all of africa , and kept an entire subsection of the gdr 's secret police/foreign intelligence bureau busy for * years * with having them invent novel ways to back those claims - * that * was a first class progaganda effort . 
  some afro-carribean mexi-rastafari with mismatched cammies taking pot-shots at a little black book - that 's almost selling-a-buk-for-a-su25 levels of ridiculous . 
  go big or go home , i say !, 
  and here i though that pattern was phased out over the course of oif i , safe for some special operations - and/or three-letter-agency guys who chose to wear it on occasion . 
  til - thanks mate !, 
  ah , many thanks mate - never heard of that gun before , will google it now . 
  i 've just clicked through to the cyrillic bbc link you provided and since i have no command of the russian language , i only looked at the picture . 
  while i 'm just your garden variety european with a ( very ) passing interest in modern american warfighters , their gear and apparel - this guy looks kind of fishy , even to me and even at first glance . 
  the cammies are certainly * very * vintage ( yet look brand new ) , the boots look kind of wrong ( like something very canvas-y with a crappy sole - not like anything standard-issue i 've ever seen on americans before anyway . 
  actually not like anything i 've seen anywhere that has been produced since , say , the 1960s ) , i could n't possibly comment on the flak jacket/plate carrier ( molle but not quite ? 
  ) , ditto regarding the tactical helmet . 
  and would anyone in the know mind telling me what exactly that gun is ? 
  it is n't a g3 or a g36 or some variant thereof , nor an hk 416 ; it is n't any type of m4/ar15 derivate i 'm familiar with ; nor is it an sa80 ( i think ) - is it an aks-74u with a different stock ?
