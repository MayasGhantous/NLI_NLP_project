  the magazine looks all wrong for an ak . 
  anyway , my fist-glance verdict would be `` weird airsoft guy on a low budget '' , certainly nothing to get [ 2012 crazy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_afghanistan_quran_burning_protests ) about . 
  nice keffiyeh though , i give him that . 
  very stylish , comrade . 
  ah , that would actually make sense . 
  is that what the `` thank you germany '' hashtags that trended on ( turkish language ) twitter were about a few days ago ? 
  clearly , he 's in on this . 
  someone call devgru , it 's about time he 's dealt with / s, 
  we 're not falling down - we have n't even started properly fighting yet . 
  i 'm increasingly weary of the moment the kid gloves - or rather , the `` leash and muzzle '' come off in post wwii pacified europe - the following mayhem wo n't be fun for anyone . 
  i 'm afraid they will come off though , sooner or later . 
  yeah , the weather is not for the faint of heart , that 's for sure . 
  on the other hand , the britons usually feel right at home . 
  you 're comparatively lucky you `` just '' froze though - my best friend , who also came to hamburg for uni , was so bothered by the `` constant wind '' ( in 99 % of all cases * i * did n't even notice there being any ` wind ' to begin with ) that he suffered from perpetual eye infections and wore scarfs all year round . 
  the guy was from southern germany . 
  unfortunately not - i 've been to st. peter more time than i care to remember while growing up , an pretty much everywhere around the area multiple times ( husum , schleswig , rendsburg , meldorf ) but for some reason managed to miss friedrichstadt . 
  looks absolutely lovely though , i 'll definitely make it a stop the next time i get my hads on a car to drive up there - many thanks for the tip !, 
  have an upvote for the lake district , mate - i 've spent some time in the general area and was duly impressed . 
  and that 's a point i , as a north german , never really understood . 
  why the heck do all my fellow germans storm your beaches instead of our own , especially to such a large degree those of us who are more of the `` best-stay-at-home '' type to being with . 
  your beaches are not all that different from ours , not really any cheaper and no less packed in summer than ours . 
  the only explanation i could possibly come up with is that your people are nicer . 
  now , your cities i actually find unique ( i 've been to amsterdam and utrecht and nijmegen so far ) and well worth the visit , but a netherlands-vacation simply for the beaches alone would never cross my mind . 
  i would like everyone who only thinks of germany in terms of `` bavaria + berlin '' plus at best stuttgart , cologne and a rhine river trip ; to come visit northern germany as well . 
  hamburg is a great , cosmopolitan , beautiful city with a lot of things to do , see and experience ( from museums and `` touristy '' stuff to a well established music scene to some great options in food , ranging from traditional non-bavarian german fare to michelin star modern german cooking and pretty much every ethnic food you could wish for ) , l\u00fcbeck an various places in the former east ( stralsund , r\u00fcgen schwerin , to name just a few ) have a lot of great historic architecture , and the countryside - both on the islands and along the coast , as well as further inland ( moors , heath , forests ) is quite diverse and interesting , especially for people from outside of northern europe . 
  the reed-roofed , timber-framed architecture of the northern german countryside is something completely alien ( and utterly fascinating , at least to the few people who i 've played tourist guide for ) to people from other continent for example . 
  as someone who has repeatedly been all over your lovely southern coast ( family living between malaga and marbella ) on all of the baleares and visited madrid a few times , i must say i was stunned of the utterly different , but no less magnificent basque country . 
  i took two friends on a 10 day trip there between christmas/early new year six years ago , and despite the shoddy weather ( which felt quite like that of my home in northern germany ) , the landscape , architecture , sights , people and of course food absolutely blew us away . 
  we 've explored san sebastian , vitoria , pamplona , bilbao , ate the best set meal of our lives at akelarre and the best steak in the world at casa julian in tolosa ; went to see the basque national team win a game in the old san mames ( complete with lots of flares , firecrackers and pitch stroming that would have seen any german match abandoned ) , blundered into a guardia civil drag-operation on a random mountain pass ( these guys were kitted out in a way they would not have looked out of place in 2006 iraq ) but were let go despite not showing them any papers , and `` discovered '' azpeitia completely by accident . 
  we celebrated the arrival of the new year at la concha beach , being taught how to properly pour cider and allegedly swear in basque by a mob of natives who were utterly perplexed to find three germans among themselves at this time of year . 
  by and large , the most memorable trip of my life . 
  ca n't wait to get back there some time in the future - definitely with a higher budget , more time and a suitcase full of clothes one to two sizes larger , to anticipate the expanding waistlines . 
  the next thing in spain i want to see is the central area besides madrid , or galicia , or possibly extremadura . 
  going into full detail regarding the reasons behind those considerations is , to a certain degree , too personal for this place . 
  i 've sent you a lengthy pm in answer to you question instead . 
  my pleasure , really . 
  and there was never any * overt * criticism of the then foreign minister * for the fact that he was gay - not even in what passes as conservative media in germany . 
  it was more of a decidedly palpable undertone in an unusually persistent public debate about whether or not he , an by all rules of the trade * objectively * excellent rhetorician/politician , ever was actually fit for the job in the first place ( a job previously held by people as `` traditionally qualified '' as one [ joschka fischer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joschka_fischer ) , for example ) that got especially noticable whenever his performance at the most recent encounter with that type of homophobe autocrats was reviewed . 
  it was more of a persistent notion of : `` this is how the recent visit of the foreign minister to saudi arabia went - nothing really went wrong , though things could certainly have gone better on some fronts , like a firmer adressing of human rights violations and the connection of saudi arabia to the funding of militant islamists worldwide , but given the circumstances \u00b0 meaningful pause \u00b0 , this was most likely the best result we could have hoped for \u00b0 cough \u00b0 whatapityreally \u00b0 cough \u00b0 , \u00b0 shrug \u00b0 . 
  next news item ... '' . 
  * guido westerwelle , in case you are interested in taking a closer look at him - the english wiki on him is , at first glance , quite thorough and informative . 
  he used to be an absolute mainstay in german politics for a long time , certainly was the figurehead of his party to most people for years ( and is by now actually well out of politics due to fighting for his life to overcome acute leukemia ) ** edit : ** sorry , forgot to answer the first half of your question : broadly speaking , fdp have not yet recovered from the near total obliteration they suffered , no . 
  on top of that , they at this point do n't seem to be willing to move into the position i pointed out in my initial post . 
  why they are n't doing it is puzzling many `` informed insiders '' ( for lack of a better word that encompasses both , interested onlookers and political sciensce folks like me , as well as the media ) at the moment . 
  my and anyone else 's best guess in that regard is that ; in a bid to counter and contain afd 's / pegida 's rise in popularity , taking any `` uncecked immigration status quo '' - critical position * whatsoever * has been so thoroughly , concertedly vilified by * all * other actors in the public sphere , that not even the fdp ( especially with public opinion of them being as feeble as it currently is ) is willing to touch that stance with a ten foot pole . 
  which is really surprising , because they are a fundamentally democratic party with a clear , sensible immigration policy that has been organically grown out of party/public discourse and been a well-known mainstay within the party 's portfolio for many years . 
  so nobody could accuse them of opportunist bandwagoning and/or pandering to populist sentiment on this issue , at least not with a straight face . 
  this general notion/interpretation , served to them on a silver platter , the intrinsically already fdp-critical media took and ran with for years : `` look everyone , here 's a party generally staffed by incompetent people who only support ` the wealthy ' ( the one tax reform they managed to implement early on was to reduce vat for the hotel sector - which brought a tiny boost to the tourism sector especially in the big cities , but was largely ineffectual and even worse , got spun as ` greasing the wealthy ' ) , who are basically your garden-variety cdu anyway , and ca n't even implement the two and half things that differentiate them from the christian democrats anyway . 
  their leadership are a gay foreign minister ( how could we force that guy on the backwards homophobe autocrats of the world ?! ), 
  with dubious english skills ; an old , fat folksy alcoholic who allegedly hits on female journalists in an inappropriate way ( huge spin-story on a run-of-the-mill offhand-comment incident that got blown utterly out of proportion , spanned months and was in retrospect really the pinnactle of all-out , almost coordinated-seeming , cross-media fdp-bashing ) , and a hyperactive asian kid , who annually changes resorts ( first ran the ministry of health , then economy ) and gets taken seriously by absolutely nobody , including the other two idiots from his own party !, 
  who would want these idiots in power ? 
  no sane person , that 's who ! '', 
  it got to a point where fdp-bashing became very much * par-for-the-course * in public discourse : everyone , from the 3rd generation feminists , to academically left intellectuals , to disappointed casual/new/prospective fdp voters ; were provided with a different reason to attack them . 
  the ( hugely inferior in quality but equally extensive in sway ) german equivalent of the daily show turned them into what can perhaps best be described as the german equivalent of the jon-stewart-era `` what-has-the-stupid-bastard-done-today ? '', 
  trump-jokes that made up a sizable chunk of * every weekly episode * for well over a year . 
  so basically , the fdp turned into a veritable punchline/meme no sane person would ever be caught dead speaking positively about , lest they wanted to alienate themselves from the rest of society . 
  `` the mainstream media '' , on a massive collective ego trip due to being the instigators and chief spin-doctors behind that avalanche of continuously self-perpetuating negativity/ridicule , subconsciously wanted to see how far they could take it and incessantly fanned the figurative flames that burned the party to the ground and had them crash out of several parliaments in successive elections , never sparing a thought for the `` imbalance in the force '' - the hole in the sphere of pluralistic representation of german political opinion they would inadvertently create by doing so . 
  this hole is , for the time being , increasingly filled by the afd - which coincidentally started out as ( i said this in my initial post above ) an `` fdp-light for fiscally literate , cosmopolitan , city-dwelleing intellectuals '' with a focus on providing an alternative take of the necessary conclusions to come out of the global financial crisis/eu bailout policy . 
  a par-for-the-course stance on immigration along the lines of `` we ca n't close our eyes ( like cdu and spd did for decades ) to the fact that germany is an immigration country , which needs to be reflected by a modern immigration policy , for which we propose a canada-like model to get the kind of immigrants we want , plus better overall integration/assimilation policies , since multiculturalism has failed '' , very much along the lines of traditional fdp immigration policy , had actually been/for many afd subsections throughout germany nominally still is , the official party policy regarding immigration since their 2014ish founding . 
  last but no least ( if you can , at this point , bare to read on ) , for clarification 's sake : was this all a sinister , top-down orchestrated , artificially-instigated , coordinated hit job on the fdp , in a sense that there was some bilderberg-for-the-media-only meeting where some people decided * `` let 's do away with the fdp - see to it , my little media people of germany ! '' * ? 
  absolutely not . 
  was the fdp completely blameless in this entire mess - a virgin victim sacrifice , unable to at any point fight back ? 
  absolutely not - they increasingly froze in the face of the ever-rising tide of anti-fdp sentiment and resorted to infighting ( `` as long as they are not currently going after me [ again ] i do n't care what they are doing to my partymate !, 
  '' ) , instead of banding together to face a common threat . 
  what happened was that by a twist of fate/luck/uttter randomness , a lot of individual chips had fallen in a way that allowed for the creation and perpetuation of a `` perfect storm '' of long-term , self-sustaining anti-fdp sentiment in the public sphere , which the fdp itself was unable to weather , so it eventually sank . 
  allow me to offer this ( extremely factually inaccurate ) metaphor of an out-of-control british-syle foxhunt to try and sum up what happened : at the start of the phenomenon redditor wandsethal would come to call the great german hunt , there was n't really much of a hunt at all - a small pack of jingletown foxhounds ( ` traditional ' fdp-antagonistic journalists ) and the foxhunters of the jingletown hunting field ( ` traditional ' fdp-antagonistic media content generators and - consumers ) are riding about the county ( germany ) , looking to chase the jingletown fox ( fdp ) in the same way all packs and hunting fields around the world have done with all foxes since time immortal - it 's what we train foxhunters and breed foxhounds for after all . 
  when they manage to flush their quarry , the animal flees on a course that has it running close by a number of villages . 
  in every village , the village hounds ( your average german journalists ) , 70 % of them foxhound ( left-leaning ) crossbreeds , hear the commotion of the hunt unusually close , jump their garden fences and join in with the pack . 
  urged on by barking of the other dogs , the sight of the fox running for its life in front of them , and the whips and horns of the huntsmen ( social media feedback ) spurring them on , the dogs revel in the thrill of the hunt ` knowing ' that they are doing ` the right thing ' by following their insticts . 
  the ruckus the perpetually growing hunt are making has reached a level that draws in foxhounds and foxhunters from further and further away from jingletown , until the commotion is so extraordinary that it is having an effect on the average people of the county , who are out and about enjoying their day . 
  curious about what 's going on , they start to follow the hunt on its ' chase , thinking * `` while i 've never been much of a hunter , and i generally do n't condone foxhunts you ca n't be missing out on something as extraordinary as this , what would the neighbors say - oh look , they 're running along already !, 
  better hurry up and join whatever-this-is as well !, 
  man , this sure is fun and what harm could possibly come off it , since i can barely even see the fox we 're hunting anyway and absolutely everyone is taking part besides !, 
  '' * when all is said and done , when the jingletown fox has been cornered and torn apart by the field ( fdp dropping out of bundestag alltogether for the first time im history ) everyone disperses and goes back about their daily business . 
  three years later , people from all over the county are dismayed when , after an unprecedentedly bountiful harvest ( migrant crisis ) and in the absence of the jingletown fox , the rats ( afd , pegida , extremist sentiment in general ) suddenly have multiplied seemingly out of nowhere and are appearing in private homes ( the public sphere ) and village barns ( local parliments ) with great boldness and in never-before-seen numbers . 
  you really should n't have thanked me in advance - the damn thing has turned into a veritable , two-part ( due to comment length constraints ) essay . 
  anyway , here goes : that 's an excellent question , connected to a * huge * topic which draws from a lot different , at the face of it only tangentially related issues , and its development spans a number of years - i 'll try to be as brief ( ** a/n : ha , look how that retrospectively turned out !, 
  ** ) and comprehensive ( ** a/n : good grief , hopefully at least this part holds somewhat true ** ) as possible . 
  first bit of background : the vast majority of german journalists ( which is , or more precisely , until recently * was * a narrowly defined , registered profession ) and an even ( slightly ) larger percentage of germans `` working in the media '' / content generators self ( !, 
  ) - identify politically as left-of-center/green supporters : 2009 poll numbers list `` journalists reporting on politics '' 's party affiliation as follows - the number behind the backslash is the percentage of support for the corresponding party among the general german population : 14/35 % cdu ; 24/23 % spd ; 14/12 % fdp ; 42/11 % greens ; 7/12 % left , 1 / 5 % no affiliation . 
  so you get over 70 % of german `` politics journalists/editors '' identifying as generally left-of-center , while the modern fdp is broady speaking ( fiscally/economically moreso than in terms of social policy ) a centrist to center-right party . 
  second bit of background : a corresponding factor is the increasing reliance of german journalists/media people on social media , especially twitter , as a self-perceived quick , easy and * reliable * way to gauge `` public opinion '' / instant plebiscite . 
  in reality , among the people who are active social media content generators , their own demographic ( above-average income , middle-class background , low-to-mid-level university education predominantly in humnatities/social studies , politically left/green leaning ) is greatly overrepresented - in germany even moreso than elsewhere . 
  which leads to a feedback-loop and eventual echo-chambering effect that marginalizes divergent opinions , resulting in an ever increasing `` observational '' bias regarding the general public mood/opinion . 
  so not only is the `` political left '' overrepresented among german journalists and editors , they also increasingly rely on sources that share their general views/support their impartial observations / parrot their personal bias back at them without challenge . 
  third bit of background : since merkel ( for simplicity and brevity 's sake i 'm going to use ) took over the cdu * a little over a decade ago * , it has seen a slow but steady implicit policy-drift towards the left . 
  if you compare party lines regarding implemented policies from the immediate pre-merkel cdu to that of ( even before the refugee issue ) today , the party has drifted roughly to the position the pre-merkel-times spd held . 
  this has led to the following developments : the cdu plays a policy field that can broadly be described as the * entire * political middle of germany . 
  as a result , it has been broadly observed for years now that the spd ( through ample mistakes of their own , but getting into detail here would blow this reply beyond any form of scope ) is getting suffocated/losing a lot of voters , since merkel 's cdu now directly appeals to a large part of their voter base , and tentative notions to get `` more breathing space '' by shifting further to the left themselves had them hemmoraging voters to the `` original/traditionally left ( ist ) '' parties of the greens and the left , respectively . 
  the cdu 's shift to the left , especially regarding eco policy/energy policy has also begun to infringe upon territory traditionally held by the greens , who draw the majority of their voters from the font of university-educated , above-average-income , eco-conscious , ( sub ) urban people . 
  the 180-degree turn by merkel to discontinue atomic energy usage well before the legally negotiated/set due dates in the wake of the fukushima-incident literally robbed the german greens of one of their defining policy foci overnight . 
  now , with their traditional unique selling point suddenly gone and a lot of the other green usps not appealing to the general public ( paternalistic eco-policies that infringe on people 's lives more than many think necessary , tax policies that directly negatively impact their voter base , normative educational policies that disadvantage their voters ' children etc. ), 
  to a degree that makes up for the pull factor lost on the energy front , the greens find themselves competing with the other party who * traditionally * appeals to very much the same voter demographics . 
  despite the steady encroachment of the cdu and especially in urban areas ( where , coincidentally , also nearly all journalists/media people live and work ) , that chief competitor is the fdp . 
  so when the party you personally feel closest to has lost its main appeal to the general public , and the rethorical vaccuum created by that loss is filled by the voices of the increasingly `` eccentric '' ( in the eyes the general public ) traditional wingnuts of said party , who then say things like `` well , now that the atomic power thing is out of the way , how about we force the general population to only eat vegetarian food for one day each week ? 
  '' , `` let 's make all german city centers no-car-zones '' , `` let 's create a just society by making everyone who earns above 64.000 eur pay significantly more income tax , and raise it to 49 % for all who earn 100.000 eur or more '' ; it is really appealing to start picking on the other party that traditionally appeals to the same demographic as your guys do ; just to make sure that they do n't profit from large numbers of green-voters whose deciding factor for their affiliaton was the atomic energy issue , and who might now be inclined to look for another party with less eccentric ( but fundamentally bedrock to the party , so the greens are unlikely to ever fully abandon them ) fringe policies to support . 
  at the same time , the fdp found itself in a ruling coalition together with merkel 's cdu , who did to them what it had done first to the spd and then to the greens before them : it leeched their issues with the broad ( est ) appeal to the public and subsequently marginalized them not only on `` their home turf '' , but in pretty much every other policy field as well . 
  so for four years , the fdp was caught in a government coalition with a substantially bigger partner , who tilled `` their '' traditional fields and sold `` their '' traditional produce to the general public as the fruits of cdu labor ; and had otherwise little interest in acquiescing to their partner in issues where both parties perceptively differred in the eye of the public . 
  a big factor that earned the fdp a lot of votes in the run-up to that election ( germany had just had 4 years of cdu-spd grand coalition and were looking for a change ) was a promise of tax policy reform . 
  merkel 's cdu ran throughout the election campaign on a public image largely in support of this traditional fdp hobby-horse .
