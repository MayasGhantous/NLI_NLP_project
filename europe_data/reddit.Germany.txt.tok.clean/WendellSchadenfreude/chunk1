i 'm sure many germans think something like that , but that does n't make it true . 
  the state never built nuclear power plants in germany just to give them away to some company , and no new nuclear plants have been built * at all * in decades . 
  also , there arguably is n't anything `` more green '' . 
  typical german self-loathing . 
  just for those of you wondering : most germans think very much like this . 
  we are * actually * worried about what to do with `` nuclear waste '' , and most of us * really * believe that there is some kind of unsolvable problem surrounding this question . 
  just change the name of your village back to h\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhelykutasipuszta - every german knows that name . 
   kidding aside , i think the book and film are quite well-known among germans who are 60 + years old . 
  if that is the target demographics he has in mind , it might actually work to an extent . 
  yes , but i was thinking about countries that * are n't * german already . 
  denmark semi-qualifies . 
  this makes me so angry i want to invade some small , defenseless country even more than usual . 
  ( all i know about hungary , i learned from reading [ `` ich denke oft an piroschka '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_often_think_of_piroschka ) . ), 
  ah , yes , that has to be very important . 
   like shrek for instance , with the best dubbing ever dubbing in animated movies is often very good . 
  i guess they have a little more room with the translation , because our brains are n't that good at picking up wether the lip movements really fit the voices 100 % . 
  i really liked the german dubbing for instance in shrek , finding nemo , or ice age . 
  he should try going to lithuania to compare - there you still hear eastwood 's original voice , voiced-over by a lithuanian speaker . 
  but most importantly , the guy is called `` klintonas ` klintas ' istvudas '' . 
  2 million people peacefully asking for a democratic referendum to be held . 
  if that reminds you of fascism , you really need help . 
   states should n't be based on identities , because that leads to brainwashing from the state for people to mindlessly identify with it . 
  when states are based on identities , people already have a reason to identify with their state , without any brainwashing . 
  you realize that you are saying that the catalan people are ( part of ) * your * group of people and * you * deserve * your * catalunya as part of spain , no matter what the people there want ? 
  talk about causing problems and injustice . 
  but of course , you want that * for totally non-nationalistic reasons * ... 
   believing certain identites have an right to a state is just not right . 
  they live in a state no matter what . 
  why should that be the * spanish * state if they 'd prefer their own ? 
  i do n't think that 's the right comparison . 
  what 's happening in eastern ukraine `` translated into catalan '' would be : * french * soldiers occupy barcelona and organize a `` referendum '' , which is held with masked soldiers in every polling place and massive intimidation of opposing views . 
  the `` independent '' country would then join france immediately , or at least become a vassal state . 
  i would * not * support * that * kind of referendum . 
  shame on you , fictional france !, 
  please expand . 
  i absolutely support a ( peaceful ) catalunian referendum , even if it is illegal . 
  it 's ridiculous that the spanish central government hides behind formalities instead of organizing a legal referendum . 
  the american independence was probably also illegal by british law . 
  lowest estimate is probably the one by the central government in madrid , they say it was `` only '' 500,000 people . 
  reported by spanish newspapers , [ e.g. 
  publico.es , via google translate ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.publico.es%2f543606%2fcatalunya-logra-la-manifestacion-mas-masiva-de-la-historia&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
   every four months when the official fidesz opinion change to their exact opposite . 
  unless you name a few examples of how this happened , it will just sound like slander . 
  - the water works in berlin are 100 % state owned . 
  [ german wiki ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_wasserbetriebe#r.c3.bcckerwerb_durch_das_land ) ; or [ look it up on bwb.de ] ( http://www.bwb.de/content/language1/html/8368.php ) , their own homepage - they were partly privatized from 1999 to 2013 . 
  - prices from 2006 to 2013 actually * decreased * . 
  [ ( this is the period i could most easily find , i do n't know about 1999-2005 . 
  ) ] ( http://www.bwb.de/content/language1/html/204.php ) - they did decrease quite a lot directly following the recommunalization . 
  - a study by the humboldt-universit\u00e4t in berlin claims that prices rose faster * before * the privatization than after it . 
  [ [ quoted here on german wiki . 
  color code : red means 75 % + german ( as the first language ) . 
  shaded red either means 50-75 % german , or polish majority with 25-50 % german . 
  white is a polish majority with up to 25 % german . 
  blue is lithuanian majority with 25-50 % german ( shaded blue ) or 0-25 % german ( solid blue ) . 
  teal and green are large forested areas . 
  very interesting , thank you . 
   would you also publish pre-wwi data about ethnic germans living in what is poland today ? 
  sure , why not ? 
  i would have posted one , but i could n't find a good one . 
  if anyone else can post a nice map with these data , i promise not to demand our lebensraum back . 
  [ i 'm ashamed to admit that i did n't get this ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twilight_of_the_idols ) without some help from google . 
  i guess i 'm not an \u00dcbermensch , just one of many-too-many ... 
  yeah , but we have a new g\u00f6tze now . 
  [ ok , this probably does n't work well ... you see , [ `` g\u00f6tze '' ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%b6tze ) literally means `` idol '' in german . 
  as in [ `` false god '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idol ) , not as in celebrity . 
  - and , of course , it was [ g\u00f6tze who scored the goal against argentina .

  dangerous rule of thumb . 
  ukip certainly thinks that labour is a bit extreme . 
  you know you can just draw a different outline , upload it to imgur , and post it here , right ? 
  because as long as * i * draw the map , sweden will never be a part of europe !, 
  my comparison suggests that brazil is bigger than portugal + spain + france + benelux + germany + switzerland + austria + italy + greece + denmark + ukraine + belarus + all the balkans and all the baltics . 
  + some countries which i forgot . 
  that is * huge * , and that was my entire point . 
  all the countries you are missing are shown on the left side of the picture . 
  of course , we all know that [ brazil is tiny when compared to giant mother russia !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxqkkyyalmu ), 
  my outline of continental europe ( on the right ) really is n't very pretty . 
  scandinavia is missing because it wanted to stay with britain ... - the outline of brazil ( on the left ) is much more accurate . 
  when talking about the distance from the equator : northern brazil is * on * the equator , obviously . 
  the northernmost host city of the world cup , [ manaus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manaus ) , is n't far from there . 
  southern brazil is about as far from the equator as north africa . 
  i used [ mapfrappe ] ( http://mapfrappe.com/ ) for these maps , of course . 
  i would also like to see a good source for this , because i 'm quite sure it 's not true . 
  sure , the communists were better organized and more experienced in underground action than other political movements . 
  their armed wing , the * franc-tireur partisans * ( ftp ) were the single biggest french resistance group . 
  taking wikipedia 's numbers , the ftp was roughly 100,000 men strong in 1944 . 
  the biggest non-communist partisan group , the * organisation civile et militaire * , had some 45,000 members . 
  there were six more partisan organisations in the national council of the resistance - all of them smaller , but certainly a few ten thousand more mre in total . 
  then there were another tens of thousands of unorganized [ * maquisards * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maquis_%28world_war_ii%29 ) , and only few of them were communists . 
  the communists were the biggest group in the r\u00e9stitance , but certainly nowhere near 90 % . 
  also , all french r\u00e9sistance groups are dwarfed by comparison with the regular [ free french forces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_french_forces ) , whose members also were `` french resistants '' of course . 
  you probably mean 2:65 instead of 2:61 , and 5:60 instead of 5:65 . 
  the government spends money on modifying the traffic signs . 
  the tax revenue is decreased by this measure . 
  the government lost money twice . 
  yes , drivers may have saved money by this if they wanted to go faster but could n't . 
  but really : these drivers * wanted * to go faster , it 's their decision if they are willing to spend more money on speed . 
  which actually costs the government money because it reduces taxes . 
  so still stupid .
