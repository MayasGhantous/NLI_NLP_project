  i have an incoming call on the other line . 
  just put everything down in front of the door and get out , ok ? 
  thanks . 
  ( answering the phone ) hello ? 
  this is jan. * gee , janni !, 
  * how is you summer break ?

  * klaus , i 'll tell you honestly : i think they should ask us germans if we want to keep paying !, 
  * ( bild 02.07.2015 ) the greek crooks are destroying our euro !, 
  ( bild 02.03.2010 ) * and you know what the worst thing is ? 
  the greeks in reality are twice as rich as we germans !, 
  * ( bild 05.02.2014 ) blind taxidrivers !, 
  married widowers !, 
  dead people receiving pensions !, 
  ( die welt , 18.02.2012 ) * why do n't you sell your islands , you bankrupt greeks !, 
  and the akropolis as well , for all i care !, 
  * ( bild 27.10.2010 ) ( taking selfies , as part of a bild campaign to send them `` no '' - selfies , 26.02.2015 ) no !, 
  no more billions for the greedy greeks !, 
  no , no , no , no , no , no , no !, 
  * russian or greek ? 
  who is more dangerous ? 
  * ( bild , 18.02.2015 ) germany is also in debt . 
  but at least we can cover them . 
  because we get up early in the morning and work all day . 
  ( bild , 05.03.2010 ) * will you stop rioting , you bankrupt greeks ?!, 
  * ( bild , 05.10.2011 ) i trust in this man in the wheelchair . 
  these extremist from greece , these superheros in hard-rock boots , they 're never gon na crack this man from germany !, 
  ( bild , 19.02.2015 ) * and how about their chaotic administration ? 
  did you know that they send money to dead pensioneers ? 
  * ( spiegel , 06.06.2011 ) this adolescent punk government ... ( stern , 20.02.2015 - freely translated ) * honestly , the euro is not a present from the gods . 
  * ( faz , 07.07.2015 ) ( laughing ) germany is supposed to pay reparations for the second world war to the greeks - yes , of course !, 
  * yeah , and iran will demand reparations from greece for the destructions under alexander the great , right ? 
  and who 's gon na pay for that ? 
  * ( laughing sarcastically ) ( dieter nuhr , german comedian ) * probably us , too . 
  * we ca n't have one currency while some have a lot of holidays , and others have hardly any . 
  ( angela merkel ) - ** this summer , we germans have a historic chance . 
  ** * so they 're sitting there , leaning against the ice cream freezer , like : `` oh , no more money ? 
  so , what are we gon na do ? 
  - let 's just call germany , they have more than enough ! '', 
  right ? 
  * you know , if you do n't want to listen , you have to find things out the hard way . 
  - ** the chance to ** not ** act like assholes for a change . 
  ** * land of ideas , germany !, 
  that 's us !, 
  and land of just sitting around ? 
  there 's no demand for that in the world !, 
  * after all , we did n't get anything for free either , we germans !, 
  - ** we have good reasons to help greece out . 
  ** * the money wo n't just arrive by mail . 
  they also learned that now , ha !, 
  * - ** because this is about something that we have n't talked about for a while now . 
  ** ( jumping on the bed ) it 's our money !!, 
  it 's our money !!, 
  our german money !, 
  ( weeping ) - ** europe ** - ** \u0395\u03c5\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7 ** - ** ( europe in other languages ) **, 
  that depends entirely on the circumstances and the jokes . 
  after the attack on a `` muhammad exhibit '' in garland , texas , the reddit threads were full of stereotype jokes about texans - the incident ended with both attackers being shot dead and nobody else seriously injured , which fit the `` do n't mess with texas ! '', 
  stereotype too well to * not * make jokes . 
  as i said , we 'll probably see the alternative soon . 
  i hope that greece will do well , i really do . 
  i just do n't believe it . 
  the rates demanded by the eu institutions were n't high . 
   [ greece only has to begin paying back the efsf loans in 2023 and they have an average period of 32.5 years . 
  the interest rates on these loans , too , are extremely low . 
  recently , the troika calculated that the average interest rate athens pays on its sovereign debt is 2.4 percent . 
  germany , by comparison , must pay an average of 2.7 percent interest on its debt . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greece-struggles-to-get-europe-to-change-course-on-austerity-a-1017533.html )  in total , greece must dedicate around 2 percent of its economic output to interest payments , according to bruegel . 
  that is more than germany , at 1.8 percent , but less than france , at 2.3 percent . 
  pretty generous loan shark . 
  but i guess we 'll get to see the alternative soon . 
  there were several points at which the markets basically demanded nothing , because they were n't willing to lend greece money , no matter the interest rate . 
  i think you 'll have to come up with a better reason . 
  germany , the imf , and the ecb have been lending greece a lot of money in the past few years at rates far better than the ones greece would have gotten at the market - if they had gotten loans at all . 
  that does not sound like a thing you would do to punish a country . 
   varoufakis resignation worth $ 50bn to eurozone wow . 
  if he had known that before , i 'm sure he would have agreed to resign for $ 1bn . 
  ( yes , i know that 's not how it works . ), 
  i 'm sick of your comment war crimes and the rhetorical genocide and the holocaust of words that you commit when you throw around words like that for no other reason than to show how mad you are . 
   i believe increasing average happiness is what counts , to put it simplified . 
  so bringing a child with a genetic defect into this world is wrong do you believe that people with genetic disorders generally add * negative * happiness to the world ? 
  how do you feel about killing them then ? 
  to be fair , there are two very different `` think of the children '' arguments in this specific discussion . 
  the common version is : `` i do n't want to talk to children about the fact that ( e.g. ), 
  some men want to have sex with other men . 
  therefore , gays should be punished . '', 
  the version used in this thread is very different . 
  it 's not `` i do n't want to talk to children about first-cousin marriage , therefore outlaw it !, 
  '' , but rather : `` children whose parents are first cousins are more likely to suffer from genetic disorders . 
  think of * these * children and protect them from the disorders . '', 
  while the former argument is a bigoted , illogical non-starter , the latter deserves at least some attention . 
   because it endangers innocent third party - the children . 
  this is very difficult to argue , because you 're talking about a third party that only exists due to the act you want to punish . 
  the children have the choice of living with a high chance of a genetic disorder , versus not living at all . 
  when you feel threatened and do n't know what to do , the correct course of action is to attack belgium and holland !, 
  - hey , that 's something i actually learned a lot about in school . 
  the one important phrase in that declaration is ** in that case ** - in case everybody else acts , we will come along . 
  a modern equivalent to this is asking the un security council for a mandate to attack someone . 
  it shows that you mean business , but the answer will be `` no '' . 
  so if obama were to say that he wants to go to war with syria , but only with a un mandate , it means he * does n't * want to go to war with syria . 
  by the way , since you talk about `` restoring the monarchy '' and `` putting the king back on the throne '' : france still was officially a monarchy at that point .
