  that declaration quite clearly says that the two countries will do * nothing * . 
  they will act * only * if all other european nations are with them ( i.e. 
  they wo n't ) . 
  granted , [ the french declaration of war ] ( http://home.wlu.edu/~patchw/his_223/revolutionary_war.htm ) sounds much nicer and more modern , but that does n't change the facts : the war started only because the french wanted it , france declared the war and started hostilities by invading its neighbours , and france greatly expanded its territory . 
  `` do what you want in your own country , but do n't harm my sister . '', 
  `` hey guys - let 's kill his sister and invade his country ! '', 
  seriously - do you learn about the revolutionary wars as * defensive * endeavours ? 
  wars during which france continously expanded and occupied most of europe ? 
  i did n't have a strong opinion coming into this thread , but hell do i want that coin now . 
   and armies being mobilized ? 
  this word is ahistoric for all the armies of the revolutionary wars , except maybe for the french . 
  ( this , by the way , is a compliment . 
  the french had the first somewhat modern army . ), 
  the only foreign threats of war that i know of were conditional - `` we will go to war if you kill the king and his family '' . 
  the french then decided that doing just that was a good idea . 
  the french declared the war , the french attacked their neighbours , and the french annexed a lot of land at the end of the war . 
  i do n't know how you can possibly try to sell this as a * defensive * war . 
  insulting other european nations is an integral and enjoyable part of being european . 
  it 's not commemorating the french defeat , it 's commemorating the victory of all the other european nations . 
  if you think that makes no difference , remember [ that the french invited the germans to join the d-day celebrations . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3361763.stm ) and i 'm really glad that you did . 
  other countries * do * care , that 's why belgium made that coin . 
  also , your post gives good examples of why we should care about stuff that happend 200 years ago . 
  i do n't understand how anyone can * not * care . 
   maybe that 's related to the fact that napoleon was n't the aggressor , only the french answer to 10 years of war the 10 years of war started when france * declared * war and invaded its neighbouring countries , annexing large territories after the victory . 
  napoleon then led a purely aggressive campaign in egypt , before returning to france and immediately making himself dictator . 
   the rule of the aristocrats vs the rule of the people . 
  at best , you could say it was the people ( of france ) against the * peoples * - the nations of europe that had been oppressed by the french for years and now made sure that this oppression would never return . 
  if you value * not * being ruled by foreigners , waterloo ( [ and leipzig ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_leipzig ) ) are events to be celebrated . 
  ( do n't tell me i am simplifying . 
  i know . ), 
  that sounds like you 're quoting some source - so you might as well have included a link . 
  do you think it wo n't hurt them because it wo n't apply to them , or because they can handle paying out 20 % , or because the law actually would work differently ? 
  if you believe , as he does , that this tax will destroy small businesses , then his interests and his countries interests are pretty much the same . 
  switzerland would suffer if most small businesses owned by a single person or family had to close shop after the death of their owner . 
  ( i have no idea what that tax reform actually would do and if you should expect it to have this consequence . ), 
  if this is the point , most people are missing it . 
  look at the top comments - they all seem to think that this is what the earth actually looks like . 
   asylum seekers are n't immigrants . 
  but are n't most of them in the end , in europe at least ? 
  or do we actually send most asylum seekers back to where they came from at some point ? 
  in case you ca n't read italy 's : it 's `` to moor a yacht '' . 
  [ mooring ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mooring_%28watercraft%29 ) basically is parking , for ships . 
   any nation that legally claims some territory while factually not holding or vice versa . 
  sorry , i do n't see this happening . 
  distant country , hundreds of kiometers from the rest of the eu , with an ill-defined state territory and a grumpy , powerful neighbour - that just does n't sound attractive to the eu . 
  i would love for the eu to cooperate closely with georgia , but i do n't see the country joining the union any time soon . 
  it 's probably also beaten by biology . 
  `` it 's not a choice '' and all that . 
  for those with trouble picturing this : [ look at the map of the world 200 million years ago ] ( http://www.iat-sia.org/uploads/images/pangea%20all%206%20of%206.jpg ) . 
  he 's using the generic `` you '' . 
  example : you can lead a horse to water , but you ca n't make him drink - i 'm not talking about * you * specifically . 
  or maybe i am . 
  do n't worry , for a long time , the english did n't consider the irish or the germans white either . 
   seriously , people have been banging on the immigration and integration drums since the ch attacks . 
  that happened in january 2015 . 
  since then , we 've seen the largest ever migration movement from muslim countries to europe . 
  actually , it was not for cowardice , because that would mean something like [ `` for having a tail '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coward ) , which does n't make any sense . 
  or we could say that it * does * make sense , because the origin of a word does n't always tell you exactly what it means in modern use . 
  `` resist the beginnings '' . 
  there 's actually a word in german for a person who boast about having a cool story to tell , but then does n't tell it . 
  even your own source does n't support your claim . 
  check for instance figure 12 . 
  it shows how much germany benefits from immigrants , depending on their education . 
  the problem : at the education level that the average immigrant had in 2012 , that benefit is * negative * . 
  the current immigrants are certainly less qualified than they were in 2012 . 
  also , this figure calculates the benefit for the first 200.000 immigrants per year - which is roughly the number germany needs to retain a constant population . 
  adding half a million immigrants per year * on top of that * certainly is n't nearly as beneficial as the first 200.000 ( who already net a negative , according to your source ) . 
  they were immigrants or the children of immigrants . 
  grandchildren at most . 
  if we have huge problems now with the immigrants who already are here or their children , mass immigration certainly is n't going to help . 
  and spare me all nonsense about gas chambers . 
   i 'm just saying that you ca n't persecute a group . 
  nobody is suggesting that you should . 
  there are suggestions however that these incidents should influence the german immigration policy . 
  while you ca n't persecute one person for the actions of another , actions of many immigrants from specific backgrounds can and should have consequences for the way we deal with people from the same background who want to immigrate . 
   he west have to regain its economic and cultural stamina , so that even poor people in middle east can see we are all about being good and happy . 
  literally millions of people in the middle east can see this clearly enough that they are trying to get to europe . 
  the journey to europe is difficult and expensive for most immigrants . 
  leaving their family behind and only bringing them to europe via family reunification is the cheapest and safest way for many immigrants . 
  i 'm not saying we should allow it in all cases , but claiming that it only provokes false marriages is certainly false . 
   do you really think that people care about this ? 
  most people do . 
  of course there are some racists who think that every foreigner is the same and evil , and some naive idiots who think that every foreigner is the same and should simply be allowed to live in any country of their own choice without any obligations . 
  but most people fall somewhere between these two idiotic positions . 
  most western countries have more than that among their general population . 
   turkey threatened ypg if they were to attack isis ? 
  can you submit some sources ? 
  good of you to ask . 
  [ here 's the bbc quoting turkish prime minister davutoglu  ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34645462 )  `` we said the [ ypg-aligned democratic union party ] pyd will not go west of the euphrates and that we would hit it the moment it did , '' mr davutoglu told turkish atv television late monday . 
  would n't be the case . 
  turkey still [ borders government held territories at the coast and areas under rebel control in idlib province , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:syrian_civil_war_detailed_map ) and they still would if the kurdish cantons were to connect . 
  only thing they would lose is their direct border with isis . 
  you 'd think they 'd be happy about that , yet somehow that contact seems to be dear to turkey . 
   as some people have mentioned , it 's more of a jab at the entire world than at germany specificly . 
  it contains the german flag twice and is subtitled `` german balance sheet '' - how do these people claim that it 's * not * about germany ? 
  may i ask about your political alignment ? 
  which polish newspapers do you think are more trustworthy , if any ? 
  why ? 
  is n't the * gazeta * one of poland 's most reputable newspapers ?
