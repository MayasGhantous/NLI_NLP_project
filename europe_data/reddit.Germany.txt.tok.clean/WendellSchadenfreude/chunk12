  of course every statistic you ever see should be viewed with a little healthy scepticism , but you make it sound like the * gazeta * is especially unreliable . 
  so , is there a story to your username ? 
   she 's the fucking head of a state . 
  head of government . 
  head of state is the [ german president ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/president_of_germany ) , joachim gauck . 
  highjacking the top comment to let people know that the serbian minister for foreign affairs * does * speak english . 
  [ ( source : bbc ) ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19017144 ), 
  no , dammit !, 
  it was an accident !, 
  oh crap , did i say that one out loud ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floods_in_the_netherlands every time the netherlands do n't pay attention for one moment , the sea tries to invade them . 
  just like the germans . 
  that 's an opinion piece , so it 's * one * person , and even he 's not actually suggesting nukes , just claiming that `` a debate about them might be conceivable ( if the us decides to completely abandon europe ) '' . 
  granted , that 's one person more than i thought there would be , but there 's not actually a debate of any kind about this in germany . 
  germany is n't getting nukes . 
  and that $ 80bn number - this guy just pulled that out of nowhere . 
  we 're not going to more-than-double our defence spending within 4 years . 
  who is `` we '' ? 
  as a german , i think our defense spending might increase , but there 's no chance we 're getting nukes . 
  i 've never even heard anyone suggest that . 
  percentage in the polls is something entirely different than `` chance to win '' . 
  the chance of the afd to `` win '' in germany ( i.e. 
  get a majority of seats in the bundestag ) within the next 20 years is quite exactly 0 % . 
  the `` chance to win '' percentages you quote for trump are also way off . 
  his lowest was ~ 10 % , his highest quite exactly 50 % [ according to 538 ] ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo ) . 
  i thought that was a sweat stain . 
   but what is stopping those refugees from just going back to europe ? 
  nothing 's `` stopping '' them , but it 's still [ 5,000 km away . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/dir/sofia,+bulgaria/kabul,+afghanistan/@42.1612351,29.6319509,4.25z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x40aa8682cb317bf5:0x400a01269bf5e60!2m2!1d23.3218675!2d42.6977082!1m5!1m1!1s0x38d1694c3c1e6d49:0xebdf473578214429!2m2!1d69.207486!2d34.5553494!3e0 ) that 's quite a trip just to spend a few months in european refugee camps . 
  i loved that in lithuania . 
  for instance , opening hours on businesses are so easy to understand even if you do n't speak lithuanian . 
  they look something like this : i-v : 8-18h vi : 8-15h, 
  you say toometa , i say tomato . 
  * they would * , obviously . 
  the survey asks about the burqa so that people even understand what the question is all about . 
  the actual law would * never * say `` the burqa is banned '' , it would obviously be phrased in an objective way . 
  ( `` clothes that cover the majority of the face must not be worn in public '' or something like that , with clear exceptions defined for protective gear etc. ), 
   if the ban goes through , would a woman wearing a shawl over her hair - or even a hoodie be subject to the consequences of this ban ? 
  clear no to both . 
  they are not talking about head scarves ( hijab ) , but only about complete face veils ( niqab or burqa ) . 
  i wish we would avoid the foreign words for these things , they just make the discussion needlessly complicated . 
   against muslims the majority of muslims do n't wear burqas or niqabs . 
  do n't pretend that this would be a decision against all muslims , it would if anything only be one against muslim fanatics . 
  yes , stopping them wearing burqas * will * end a lot of attitudes - the attitudes of almost everybody around them . 
  nobody in the west ever just smiles at and talks to a person wearing a burqa . 
  the burqa alone is enough to exclude anybody from our society completely . 
  taking it off is n't * enough * , but it 's an absolutely necessary step so that you can possibly become a somewhat normal member of any western society . 
  a full face covering makes it impossible for a person to ever integrate into a western society . 
  allowing that hurts us and them much more . 
  and obviously the law would n't actually single out muslims . 
  that 's not how laws are written in germany ( or basically anywhere else ) . 
   this would be a lot less controversial if it was an all-around ban on covering your face and not a ban for a certain religious garment . 
  * it is . 
  * why are people always pretending like the law would literally say `` the burqa is banned '' ? 
  a law like that would always be unconstitutional in germany . 
  the `` burqa ban '' would definitely * actually * ban clothing that covers the face , with some exceptions for protective gear and masks under appropriate circumstances . 
  you ca n't deport a german citizen anyway , regardless of whether they have another citizenship . 
  nobody who 's wearing a burqa has any chance of every intergrating into a western society . 
  the consequences of that are part of `` the problem '' . 
  no law like that would ever say `` the burqa is banned '' , it would always be clothing that conceals the face - which is both burqas and niqabs , but not the simple headscarf ( hijab ) . 
  and inb4 `` helmets , masks '' : laws can have exceptions . 
  wearing protective gear while welding or riding a motorcycle would obviously be allowed , as well as masks during celebrations . 
  if nobody does and nobody ever would , it does n't hurt anyone . 
  but of course there are some people in germany who wear burkas . 
  i personally see maybe two or three every year , and i do n't live in an area with a particularly high number of muslims . 
  portugal-france also went to extra time . 
  including the navy ? 
  come on , man . 
  it 's `` debrexing '' - you have to keep the puns rolling . 
  from when ? 
  if you 're talking about right now : your politicians seem average at worst . 
   dont like the hole ? 
  should not have digged it . 
  if you 're not a native speaker , you should probably use `` dug '' rather than `` digged '' . 
  thanks . 
  that actually seems kind of fitting . 
  if i understand correctly , most of the opposition parties are worse than erdogan 's akp with regard to this question . 
  edit : [ chp , the largest opposition party . 
  ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/main-opposition-chp-ready-for-a-joint-stance-with-govt-against-ep-over-genocide-motion.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=81137 ) ( from last year , about a similar situation . ), 
  [ mhp , another large opposition party . 
  ] ( http://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2016/06/02/mhp-chairman-slams-germany-urges-govt-to-impose-diplomatic-sanctions ) the only party in turkey that is not insane in this regard is the ( mostly kurdish ) hdp . 
  it 's not just erdogan being an idiot . 
  what does that rhyme in `` akit '' mean ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_height#average_height_around_the_world ) sadly has no international data for adolescents , and not even any data for moroccon males . 
  among adult females however , the reported size difference between the average dutch ( 169 cm / 5 ' 6.5 '' ) and the average moroccon ( 158.5 cm / 5 ' 2.5 '' ) is more than 10 centimeters !, 
  that irritates me so much , because it 's grammatically incorrect . 
  it should be `` germany should never have reunited '' or `` germany should never have * been * reunified '' . 
  as a german , i will not stand for such [ sloppiness ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiadhewiay8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=52 ) !, 
  this is a meaningful difference , by the way . 
  the ones that are called `` bundesministerium der/des ... '' are the ones that can never be abolished because they either are mentioned in the constitution ( defence , justice , and finance ) or are simply so fundamental ( interior and foreign ) . 
  edit : this difference is clearest with the ministry of justice . 
  it 's called '' ... * der * justiz und * f\u00fcr * verbraucherschutz '' - `` justiz '' ( justice ) is its constitutionally mandatory task , and `` verbaucherschutz '' ( consumer protection ) is just something tacked on later . 
  fixed what ? 
  nevermind , found it . 
  i didnt think googling `` cap eu '' would help , but google is wicked smat . 
  can i get a translation somewhere ? 
  sorry , but you 'll have to be way more clear than that . 
  how do you pay more than 100 % taxes on your income ? 
  do you just mean that your taxes are higher than your income after taxes ? 
  ( if you get 30k and the government gets 30k , that 's usually called 50 % taxes , not 100 % . ),
