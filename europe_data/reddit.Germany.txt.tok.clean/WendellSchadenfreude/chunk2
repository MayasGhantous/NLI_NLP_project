  you think the people passing everybody else at 110 in the middle lane are * frustrated * at other people 's stupidity ? 
  they are ecstatic . 
  nothing better on the motorway than having everybody else just get out of the way for you . 
  america has supposedly the same problems with [ her infrastructure as germany does . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/80178726-d05f-11e3-af2b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz32babmdua ) for now , we are both still complaining on a very high level . 
  ( for now ... ), 
  thank you for this analysis . 
  just to make sure this was n't just a problem with one single question , i checked another one ; the one [ about fradulently claimed benefits ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wbfpqfw.png ) . 
  the result is the same : the biggest group admit that they do n't know the number . 
  the second biggest group gives the most correct answer possible in this survey , 1-10 % . 
  the independent only quotes the `` mean '' of 24 % - but less than one third of the people believe it 's that high ( or higher ) . 
  this is n't the public opinion being very wrong , it 's journalists misrepresenting numbers - intentionally or because they do n't understand statistics . 
  so you did n't actually ask [ william tell ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_tell#the_legend )  gessler -- intrigued by tell 's famed marksmanship , yet resentful of his defiance -- devised a cruel punishment : tell and his son would be executed , but he could redeem his life by shooting an apple off the head of his son , walter , in a single attempt . 
  tell split the apple with a bolt from his crossbow . 
  or maybe just split up the 66-89 % group further . 
  when the national average is 65 % , i do n't think the top group should start at 66 % anyway . 
  what system is used for the ep election in the uk ? 
  winner-takes-all as in the national elections ? 
  interesting . 
  i would have preferred a reversed color scheme : going yellow-orange-red usually indicates higher parameter values . 
  gluck , gluck , gluck ... aaaaaah !, 
  judging from the coat of arms , the city that the first poster talks about is [ flensburg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flensburg ) . 
  it was more or less danish for most of it 's history before 1864 ( although the `` 1000 years '' are probably an exaggeration - we do n't know when the city was founded , but the year 800 would be * really * early ) , but voted to stay german in the end . 
  so it 's free , but you do have to pay for it ? 
  i do n't get it . 
   not for black people . 
  yes , it is . 
  for four of the six types of cancer reported , survival rates for blacks in the us are better than general rates in france . 
   replacing the bulbs is unfortunately not enough it is when done right . 
  a different light bulb can already emit light in a different part of the spectrum - you can switch to a color that still allows human eyes to see , but is n't scattered as much by the atmosphere . 
  ( more yellow , less blue , basically . ), 
  of course , the ban of incandescent bulbs had nothing to do with light pollution . 
  this was just an example to show that politicians already care about out lightbulbs , even when it pisses people off . 
  now you 're just lamenting ... street lights need replacing from time to time anyway . 
  and even just switching the bulb can do a lot . 
  wikipedia has a section on [ the reduction of light pollution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/light_pollution#reduction ) , with some examples . 
  this very idea has only been around for some 25 years . 
  this sounds exactly like the kind of idea that decision makers in brussels would care about . 
  ( were classic light bulbs banned only in germany , or is that eu-wide ? ), 
  on the contrary , we 're the generation that can see them * the worst * . 
  the most effective steps against light pollution are the easy ones . 
  switching off some lamps that are n't needed , and using lamps that only shine light where you need it - not straight upwards as well . 
  we 're only just starting to even think about implementing these measures . 
  the night sky that your grandchildren see will once again be as magnificent as the one that your grandparents saw . 
  hint : no , he does n't . 
  few europeans do , sadly . 
  do people really use reino unido , or inglaterra/england ? 
  i do n't know where you get your numbers , they seem inflated . 
  there are n't 6.7 million people who get hartz iv despite working , there are n't even 6.7 million people who get hartz iv at all . 
  about 1.3 million of those are working . 
  there 's no clear trend for that number , it has basically remained unchanged over the past few years . 
  comparing their living standard to slavery conditions is obscene and ridiculous . 
   but if you look at the interquartile range and median of wage distributions you need to adjust this for the simple fact that there are more than three million more people employed in germany [ today than there were in 1998 ] ( http://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/soziale-situation-in-deutschland/61685/entwicklung-der-erwerbstaetigkeit ) . 
  your statistics only deal with wages , so anyone who is unemplyoed and really poor is simply ignored . 
  but when that person finds a job that pays below the german median , he 's dragging down the average - even though * everybody * is better off . 
  - bear in mind that this happened * millions of times * !, 
   in the last 15 years the `` real wage '' has sunken - i do n't know if there is any other country except for maybe greece or so where this happened . 
  randomly decided to look at the uk to see if this was true . 
  [ wages in the uk just fell to the 2003 level . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/13/real-wages-fall-back-2003-levels-uk-ons ) not 15 years , just ten , but just look a little closer : wages in the uk increased from 2002-2009 and then started falling rapidly . 
  in germany on the other hand , wages decreased from 2004-2008 and * did already increase * from 2008 to 2013 . 
  people in this thread claim that german wages need to increase because of germany 's recent economic success . 
  in reality , * this has already happened . 
   the part about stagnating wage wages in germany decreased from 2004-2008 , but * increased * [ from 2008 to 2013 ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:lohnentwicklung_deutschland.svg ) . 
  currently , they seem to be stagnating again , although all numbers for 2013 are somewhat preliminary . 
  wages in germany * did * already increase because of the successful economy in the past few years . 
   it does n't matter whether those responsible for that regime intended something different . 
  then why does krugman claim that these consequences * are * intented ? 
  that 's my criticism of this article : that he claims those who do n't agree with him * want the poor to suffer * . 
  i think your analysis is completely false , but i wo n't accuse you of * intentionally spreading lies * because you * want people to suffer * . 
  krugman accuses people of doing just that . 
   content posted relatively early with a lot of `` effort '' put into it just be careful not to be confused by the name `` low effort content '' . 
  the `` effort '' in question is the one the `` consumer '' needs to put in to decide wether to upvote this content . 
  if i use my mad photoshop skillz ( i do n't even own photoshop ... ) to create a great image , it might take me hours - a lot of effort for me . 
  but for everybody else , it would be just a picture , and it 's easy to decide within a second or two wether you like it or not . 
  if i write a two-page article , it might actually cost me less time and effort , but you have to read it ( in theory ... ) before you know wether to upvote . 
  the line is just a few 3 '' - '' symbols . 
  -- in case you want to see what other people think about the `` small bite size content '' , [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/1fxgwz/lets_stop_using_the_term_loweffort_content_and/ ) i 'm quite certain , by the way , that it 's not a generational issue . 
  it 's just the nature of the content ; people are the same we have always been . 
  ck2 is my first paradox game , so i ca n't compare it to eu3 . 
  i love the game and would recommend it to anyone who likes `` complicated '' games . 
  family management is important , but you can still do a lot of conquering . 
  the fact that you 're playing as a character/dynasty and not as a country adds an interesting layer to the game . 
  i sometimes find i identify more with a ck2 ruler than i ever did with most characters in rpgs . 
  if you 're thinking about getting it , wait until monday . 
  the next expansion is coming out , so there will likely be several sales of the original game and the older expansions , with ~ -75 % prices . 
  - - - about 50 % of my karma is from askreddit , where my posts are usually less than three sentences long . 
  damn , yours is much better ... 
  in case anyone was wondering : [ modomario really said `` oh . 
  germans '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/1dq8ct/cases_of_beer_opener/c9stipz ) - it 's one of his top comments , i found it fitting ... 
  [ i do n't know . 
  what do you think ? 
  nothing against krugman in general , but this article is lousy . 
  it only makes any sense when one shares what seems to be krugman 's basic assumption : that those who do n't agree with him * want to see the poor suffer * . 
  [ i always liked this quote of his . 
   this is what happens * what * is what happens ? 
  from this map , i 'd say the uk is doing ok . not great , clearly , but better than holland and denmark , to to mention `` the south '' . 
  ok , last one : sabine leutheuser-schnarrenberger , please . 
  west , nrw .
