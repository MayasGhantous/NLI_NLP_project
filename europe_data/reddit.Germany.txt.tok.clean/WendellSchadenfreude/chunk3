  note : i went to school in the 90s and i learnt it exactly like that . 
  i vividly remember the fast l-m-n-o-p part . 
  now tell us how to pronounce angela !, 
  i think you 're right about samoa . 
  also , one of the channel islands . 
  jersey , i believe . 
  emission papers are for co2 , which is n't much of a ( direct ) problem for human health anywhere near its atmospheric concentrations . 
  i guess you were joking anyway ...

  it 's quite an international clich\u00e9 . 
  [ source : asterix . 
  the biggest con : you do n't really know what you vote for . 
  right now , all that anybody knows is that `` merkel won '' . 
  but what does that mean ? 
  do we get a grand coalition , a conservative-green coalition , or even a coalition of all the parties of the political left against the cdu ? 
  the voters do n't really get to decide this question . 
  instead , there 's are maybe ten people in berlin who decide this in camera . 
  i do n't know what could be done to improve this . 
  do you know if this method already has a name , or did you just come up with it yourself ? 
  that is not a position of the party , it 's just a general musing one of their operatives made years ago . 
  your making some huge jumps in your reasoning here . 
  the best alternative to abortions is not becoming pregnant * unless you want to . 
  this map does n't show the legal status of abortions ( although there is , of course , a strong correlation ) , is simply shows the abortion rates . 
  supporting the legality of abortions is not the same as celebrating abortions . 
  no matter how you look at it , an abortion is not a good thing . 
  * zero * abortions would be the best number . 
  * and * zero rapes and unwanted children , of course . 
  * `` becoming pregnant '' , or `` getting someone pregnant '' , of course . 
  i do n't want to imply that this is the woman 's responsibility , i 'm simply writing from the female perspective because the woman would also be the one actually having the abortion . 
  - - - i 've said `` abortion '' to often . 
  the word has lost all meaning ... 
  are they absurd because they have few abortions ? 
  ok , calm down . 
  poland is * very religious * and somewhat rural , and it 's blue . 
  blue means * almost no abortions * . 
  - - - you wrote : `` basically , more religious fanatics and rural folk equals more abortions . '', 
  by now , i assume that you wrote `` more abortions '' , but meant `` fewer '' - is that it ? 
  stop reading that , please . 
  and * look * at the map we are all talking about for just ten seconds . 
  you will see that what you said is simply * not * true for europe . 
  it all black . 
  i think that means 100 % abortions . 
  for germany : no , the opposite is true . 
  the stronghold of conservatism in germany is bavaria , which has the lowest rates . 
  east germany and the city states are the least conservative , and they have the highest rates . 
  basically , no . 
  edit : no , really . 
  this is just completely false , i think `` no '' is the best possible response . 
  the lowest rates of abortions are in portugal , poland , and ireland , three of the most religious countries in europe . 
  ireland is also one of the most rural countries , and the other two are n't * that * urbanized either . 
  thank you . 
  but it was n't my idea , this is stolen from somewhere . 
  allegedly mark twain , although i 'm not sure if i should believe that . 
  like this ? 
  for example , in year 1 that useless letter c would be dropped to be replased either by k or s , and likewise x would no longer be part of the alphabet . 
  the only kase in which c would be retained would be the ch formation , which will be dealt with later . 
  year 2 might reform w spelling , so that which and one would take the same konsonant , wile year 3 might well abolish y replasing it with i and iear 4 might fiks the g/j anomali wonse and for all . 
  jenerally , then , the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants , and iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants .

  do you wish these old italian dialects all were still alive and taught in schools ? 
  yep , that 's quite obviously praise . 
  i wonder if / u/pegasus _ 527 is one of the few europeans who think that `` atheist '' is a bad word . 
   `` free '' as in you 'll pay twice as much through taxes , that is . 
  would be really interesting to see these numbers - `` how much does travelling 100 km by train * actually * cost in different countries ? '' . 
  sadly , i guess these numbers are impossible to get and even more impossible to compare . 
  that hand gesture has been talked about a lot longer already . 
  at the very least since merkel 's party put on this [ huge poster at the berlin main station ] ( http://blogfraktion.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/img_5311.jpg ) . 
  ( the text says `` deutschlands zukunft in guten h\u00e4nden '' - `` germany 's future in good hands '' ) and of course they only used that poster because the gesture already was highly recognizable before . 
   it 's pretty accurate , one thing that is missing , which has hugely shaped the election campaign of the left is how her cabinet has been riddled with scandals , internal strife and resignations . 
  at most it 's on a par with schr\u00f6der 's first cabinet . 
  there have been four `` real '' resignations : jung , guttenberg , r\u00f6ttgen , and schavan . 
  ( not including the rearrangement when r\u00f6sler became vice chancellor . ), 
  compare that to cabinett schr\u00f6der i : lafontaine , klimmt , fischer , funke , scharping . 
  lots of stuff not included , still five resignations . 
  the biggest scandal that this government was involved in was the on about plagiarized phd theses . 
  other countries would pay to have problems like that . 
  does something like this exist for other parties as well ? 
  i have to say , i 'm really impressed . 
  drinking as much as the germans , and then almost half as much again ... that 's dedication . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i never heard of anything called `` cordoba '' . 
  cheers !, 
  literally : little bump or light knock . 
  ( clich\u00e9 , of course ... ) [ here 's a video of how not to use `` st\u00f6\u00dfchen '' .

  tell me more about this !, 
  so we could simply invade luxembourg , make their life misserable to kick them off the list , and we 'd be in the top 25 at least ? 
  sucks that we 'd still be behind france , but we should think about it ... 
  so your new government might be `` right-left '' ? 
  silly norwegians ... 
  all `` progressive '' west germany . 
  i do n't think pedophiles ever had any standing in the conservative parties . 
  * - but i was actually serious . , 
  you should post this on / r/mapporn . 
  it is n't . 
  might be your computer . 
  full text :  angela merkel 's main rival in the german general election next month has pledged to suspend eu-us trade talks over the national security agency spying scandal if he replaces her as chancellor .
