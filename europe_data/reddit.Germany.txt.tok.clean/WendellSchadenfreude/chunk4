   in a further sign that the nsa row has soured relations between the us and its european allies , peer steinbr\u00fcck , leader of the social democratic party , told ard tv : `` i would interrupt the negotiations until the americans say if german government offices and european institutions are bugged or wiretapped . 
  we do n't know if the americans may be sitting under our desks with some technical devices . '', 
  he pledged to press washington about the spy agency 's activities before continuing with the talks about a transatlantic free trade agreement . 
   his move comes after germany 's der spiegel weekly reported that the nsa bugged the united nations ' new york headquarters , with the european union and the international atomic energy agency among those targeted . 
   der spiegel said files obtained by whistleblower edward snowden showed that the nsa spied on the eu in new york after it moved to new rooms in autumn 2012 and that the nsa runs a bugging programme in more than 80 embassies and consulates worldwide called the `` special collection service '' , which has `` little or nothing to do with warding off terrorists '' . 
   other files cited in the report describe how the nsa managed to access the un 's video conferencing system and crack its security . 
   snowden 's revelations about the nsa have plunged privacy-conscious germany into outrage during the campaign for the election on 22 september . 
  distrust of the government 's handling of the surveillance scandal threatens to damage merkel 's bid to retain the chancellorship . 
   earlier this month , her government attempted to reassure voters that us and british intelligence agencies had observed german laws in germany . 
  but critics remained sceptical , pointing out that would not stop foreign agencies accessing german online communication data transferred to the us-based servers of google , facebook or microsoft . 
   at a recent rally , the chancellor struggled to make herself heard over chants of `` hypocrite '' and `` liar '' and the sound of vuvuzelas being blown by opponents worried about stories of american snooping . 
   germany 's independent privacy watchdogs say the surveillance programmes run by the nsa breach an eu-us pact meant to ensure cross-border data protection . 
  `` we 're just at the beginning of the debate , '' frank-walter steinmeier of the social democrats said on friday . 
  `` the assurances ... do not refer to data taken from american servers . '', 
  declared that they would , or declared that they would n't ? 
  strictly speaking , `` no '' could mean either that you think other cultures are equal to yours , or that you think your own people are perfect ( and probably * far * superior to all others ) . 
  it 's still early in the campaign . 
  it 's a trend of the recent elections to make campaigns as short a possible . 
  i think it 's because it looks good if your campaign is somewhat seens as a `` response '' to your opponents campaign . 
  and also , of course , because it 's cheaper . 
  now read up on the [ dogger bank incident ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dogger_bank_incident ) of 1904 . 
  it was when the glorious russian baltic fleet mistook some british fishing trawlers for japanese torpedo boats ... 
  i 'll let wikipedia take it from here :  the disaster of 21 october began in the evening , when the captain of the supply ship kamchatka ( \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430 ) , which was last in the russian line , took a passing swedish ship for a japanese torpedo boat and radioed that he was being attacked . 
   later in the night , during fog , the officers on duty sighted the british trawlers , interpreted their signals incorrectly and classified them as japanese torpedo boats . 
  the russian warships then trained their searchlights on the trawlers and opened fire . 
  the british trawler crane was sunk , and its captain and first mate were killed . 
  four other trawlers were damaged , and six other fishermen were wounded , one of whom died a few months later . 
   as the trawlers had their nets down , they were unable to flee , and in the general chaos , russian ships shot at each other : the cruisers aurora and dmitrii donskoi were taken for japanese warships and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation , damaging both ships and killing at least one russian sailor and severely wounding another , and fatally wounding a naval chaplain . 
   during the pandemonium , several russian ships signaled torpedoes had hit them , and on board the battleship borodino , rumors spread that the ship was being boarded by the japanese , with some crews donning life vests and lying prone on the deck and others drawing cutlasses to repel a boarding . 
   more serious losses to both sides were only avoided by the extremely low quality of russian gunnery , with the battleship oryol reported to have fired more than 500 shells without hitting anything . 
  the russians , incidentally , were on the way to east asia . 
  their asian fleet had been beaten badly by the japanese and was bottled up in port arthur . 
  the baltic fleet , sent to relieve them , arrived after eight months , only to be completely devastated in the battle of tsushima . 
  - - - not to be confused with the more serious wwi [ battle of dogger bank . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_dogger_bank_%281915%29 ), 
  that must have been such an awesome river .

  i think paying back debts is both business and a moral obligation , while `` reparations '' have rarely been a matter of morals , only of power . 
  but i 'm glad we agree that there * is * a difference . 
  you 'll pay for the damages from the thirty years ' war , * and * you 'll take vorpommern ? 
  you 're being too generous !, 
  oh , but it is . 
  germany today is legally the same state as nazi germany , the weimar republic , and the german empire . 
   for example , the germans owe several billions to greece paying back debts is n't the same as paying `` reparations '' .

   ( with finns said to be among the nastiest in the war ) if it 's any consolation : nobody in germany remembers that . 
  anybody interested in history knows ( in quite some [ horrific detail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwedentrunk ) ) that the swedes pillaged and burned all the way through germany , but this is the first i ever hear of finns in that army . 
  oi , that is sad . 
  i never even heard about that before . 
  i did not mean only stauffenberg personally . 
  this plot - not simply an assassination , but a complete coup d'\u00e9tat - was supported by a rather diverse group of people . 
  you ca n't really say what `` their '' motives were , because they were different for each of them . 
  some of them * were * in opposition to hitler because of his crimes . 
  i only named stauffenberg because i do n't imagine many of our fellow r/europeans will be interested in too much detail about this . 
  and i would choose this plot ( and not the white rose or any other resistance movement ) because it was afaik the only plot that had any real chance of actually ending the nazi regime . 
  - - - in any case : i still feel that it 's totally unimaginative to say that there is no `` proudest moment '' for germany just because of `` a certain 12 year period '' . 
  even if german history * were * limited entirely to the hitler era , there would still be enough to be proud of . 
  ( more to be ashamed of in that case , but that was n't the question . ), 
  although to actually answer the question , what would you choose ? 
   oh , and our cunning plan to ease pressure on the eastern front during wwi turned out not to have been such a smart idea after all . 
  yes , we can be blamed for that as well . 
  that was not a shameful moment for germany in my view . 
  to come up with this plan was brilliant . 
  `` we only need to send this lenin guy back home , and he 'll start a revolution and force russia out of the war '' - i do n't know how anybody could present this as a `` plan '' without laughing . 
  but to do it * and be right about it * , that 's pretty amazing in my book . 
  even if the long-term consequences were not entirely favourable . 
  to pick something that is closer to being a `` moment '' , how about the [ raid on the medway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raid_on_the_medway ) ? 
  that was pretty badass at least , just sail over to england and burn or capture the royal navy 's biggest ships . 
  is that something you are still proud of ? 
  gutenberg 's printing press was possibly the most important contribution overall , but to me it does n't feel like something our country did - it was just one person . 
  for lutheranism , it would be difficult to big one `` moment '' . 
  you might choose the [ augsburg confession ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augsburg_confession ) - that was pretty cool and in a way modern . 
  a major problem with this is that it would piss of the catholic half of germany to talk about this as `` our proudest moment '' . 
  if not 1870/71 ( which i posted elsewhere in this thread ) , i 'd go with the [ battle of the nations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_leipzig ) or possibly simply the peaceful reunification and fall of the berlin wall .

  [ `` gustav adolf ( the swedish king ) , a christian and a hero , at breitenfeld saved religious freedom for the world . '' ], 
  does a motto like this exist about him in swedish , too ? 
  the main problem afaik is that the animal has to be `` uninjured '' before the slaughthering begins ; therefore , they are n't stunned . 
  i think this is a confusing way of showing your data - packing two different scenarios into one chart . 
  still , i 'd be interested in more of ( almost ) the same . 
  i think the only interesting question is : if there is no cdu/fdp majority , will merkel form a coalition with the spd or with the greens ? 
  well , not your fault .
