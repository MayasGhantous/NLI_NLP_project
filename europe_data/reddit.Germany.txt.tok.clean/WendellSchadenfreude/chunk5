  spiegel online already used that title . 
  ... this just happened two days ago ? 
  crazy ... 
  yes , but are you really crashing a party if nobody even notices you unless they really want to ? 
  i like sonneborn , by the way . 
  the * partei * is a fun project . 
  it just does n't have any political relevance . 
  i have no idea what they mean by `` crashing the election '' . 
  they are going to run . 
  they are going to get less than 1 % of the vote . 
  this is n't comparable to the italian 5 star party or anything . 
  finland is n't in the deep south , you dork . 
  [ it 's in minnesota . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland,_minnesota ), 
   how was that condecending ? 
  i certainly was n't meant that way . 
  i guess you learned what `` condescending '' means in secondary school and just did not think of it when posting . 
  this is so cool . 
  why did n't they critizise china directly though ? 
  too powerful ? 
  ( i would n't have thought that iceland needs to be afraid of china . ), 
  come to think of it , we never invaded cyprus either , did we ? 
  i 'm just asking . 
  you know , out of curiosity ... 
  i do n't think we 've ever invaded anywhere out of pure curiosity . 
  yet . 
  it 's still missing from the collection . 
   neutral but wired with explosives just in case . 
  the whole thing will be spectacular if things go south i kind of want to invade just to see what happens ... 
  well , somebody has to do it , so here goes : [ what makes a man turn neutral ? 
  lust for gold ? 
  power ? 
  or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality ?

  everything else i knew has already been writen by others , so i 'll just add this : ireland was neutral in wwii . 
  some thousands of irish soldiers decided to join the allies anyway . 
  these soldiers were considered traitors by the irish government , and were rehabilitated only last year - and there still was some controversy about it !, 
  great discoverers . 
  ( ~ 500 years missing ) . 
  they had a dictator who was basically franco , but not franco . 
  got rid of him in a peaceful ( `` carnation '' ) revolution . 
  also : not the same timezone as spain . 
  or poland , twice . 
  `` no ... '' - still think this was his most memorable quote , and it fits well here . 
   khal drogo ( the large , smiling guy ) and daenaeris you think there 's people who do n't know who khal drogo is , but know `` khaleesi '' by her real name ? 
  ( it 's * daenerys * , btw . ), 
  i 'm not entirely sure , but i think we agree on this : it should n't matter to the state wether i am single , live with the love of my life ( whatever gender ) , am part of a polyamorous circle or have special feelings for my house plant - none of this should be punished or rewarded . 
  having children is something that the state might want to encourage , and it 's at least justifiable if there is a financial reward for it . 
   hat to be fought in by law . 
   every single right we got ( e.g. 
  : right for provacy/protection of data ) was decided by the constitutional court . 
  not once , in the history of the federal republic , was any government able to increase the personal freedoms of the population on their own . 
  that 's an exaggeration at least . 
  one particularly interesting example is the [ informationsfreiheitsgesetz ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/informationsfreiheitsgesetz#gesetzgebungsverfahren_und_vorgeschichte ) . 
  ( freedom of information law , which grants germans access to basically all the data of any federal agency ) it 's interesting ( to me , at least ) because of the complicated legislative history . 
  the law was proposed by the red/green parliament majority in 2005 and would usually have been blocked in the second chamber by the cdu l\u00e4nder governments . 
  only in this case , the government had already called for early elections , and the liberal fdp decidedly supported the law and basically was able to push it through the second chamber ( bundesrat ) . 
  things were more complicated than this , of course , but this was the basic story . 
  too bad you had to end your comment with '' !!!, 
  ! 111 '' , because it 's otherwise true , of course . 
  why should the government reward people ( straight or gay ) for having found a partner they love and want to marry ? 
  i 'm mostly happy about this court ruling because it might make conservative ( or secretly anti-gay ) politicians to push for an abolishment of all tax breaks for married couples ( probably in favor of tax breaks for parents ) . 
  trying to milk [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sdyfxqs.jpg ) for karma . 
   i 'll tell you how it goes ... edit : well , [ twelve upvotes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1fqwi5/cat_has_found_a_save_place_in_the_flooded_areas/ ) . 
  i expected more . 
  which can also be found in that same coat of arms , if you look close enough . 
  i was mostly fascinated by the fact that both germans and english use a foreign expression , but they take it from different languages . 
  ( `` honi soit ... '' , for instance , is in german usually just quoted using the german words , `` ein schelm , wer b\u00f6ses dabei denkt . '' ), 
  for starters : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/droit_du_seigneur it 's interesting that the french word is used in english . 
  in german , we use the latin phrase `` ius primae noctis '' , `` right of the first night '' . 
   the turks later in history went as far as to vienna , but they were eventually defeated . 
  they actually did that twice , and the first time was * before * the battle of lepanto , in 1529 . 
  ( second time 1683 . ), 
  might be because it helps as a scale of how good your knowledge of turkey is . 
  if this list includes basically anything you know about germany , you do n't know much , even though it is enough to often follow conversation and sometimes even crack jokes about germany or something . 
  still , you should learn more before forming an opinion about germany . 
  comparing this to the list of things about turkey , i do know a little more , but not much . 
   invaded byzantine empire in 1473 , changed constantinople to istanbul . 
  1453 crusader kings ii has tought me so much ... , 
  if i got to decide what being `` fluent '' in a language means , i 'd be far from it . 
  but i know some people who claim to be fluent in english despite being worse than i am . 
  i read scientific articles or news in english , i watch english language tv series and can understand scientific talks in english , and i can ( somewhat awkwardly ) talk myself about basically any subject in english - i 'd call that level * `` good enough '' * rather than `` fluent '' . 
   this sub is obsessed with turkey and they 're barely in europe careful , you 'll need to find a definition of europe that includes cyprus but excludes turkey ... ( edit : using non-geographical definitions is * cheating * . ), 
  ca n't answer any of these questions for europe in general . 
  backpacking through portugal in summer is pretty much the same as backpagging through northern finland in winter in that it 's not a good idea . 
  backpacking in london or stockholm is expensive , backpacking through belarus or kosovo much cheaper and more ... * adventurous * . 
  do you have * any plan * on where you want to go ( geographically ) and for how long ? 
  lithuania and latvia have no islands at all . 
  estonia has more than one and a half thousand . 
  - - - for `` cheers '' , they say `` dirty sex '' . 
  at least , that 's what all foreigners do who ca n't remember `` terviseks '' ( and then we think we are so very original ) ... 
  yeah , you 're right of course . 
  somehow in reformulating that sentence it ended up as complete nonsense . 
  i was mostly thinking of tauras ( ? ), 
  as the horrible beer , but ome others as well . 
  i soon stopped experimenting and always ordered svyturys ekstra . 
  ahm ... the street leading to the town square is called `` vokie\u010di\u0173 gatv\u0117 '' , literally the `` street of the germans '' . 
  i have no idea why that is , i just realized when looking at google maps . 
  vilnius is definitely worth a visit . 
  can be part of a , say , two-week tour across the baltics .
