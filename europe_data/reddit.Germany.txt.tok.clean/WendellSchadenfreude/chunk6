  i do n't understand why this region is n't far more popular - very nice people , good beer ( \u0160vyturys - and stick to \u0160vyturys ) , good food ( potatos and meat , no matter what you order - you ca n't really go wrong here . 
  also try \u0160altibar\u0161\u010diai , the lithuanian version of borscht ) , very nice girls ( included in people , of course , but mentioning them again ca n't hurt ) , everything is dirt cheap ( in lithuania and latvia at least ) , and it makes for far more interesting stories than visiting spain or england or some other place where * everybody * has been already . 
  the guided tour has to end here , because i 'll have to try and find the clubs that i visited when i was here to meet some friends of mine , but if you want to continue sightseeing , you can just walk down did\u017eioji gatv\u0117 and pilies gatv\u0117 , which brings you to the st. stanislaus cathedral ( with the monument of grand-duke gediminas ) and the lithuanian national museum in less than 10 minutes of walking . 
  russia , the chinese canada !, 
  the lithuanian word for town hall is `` rotu\u0161\u0117 '' - this is derived from the german word `` rathaus '' . 
  the historic town hall shown in the pictures has n't been used as such for a long time . 
  in one of the pictures ( 1988 ) , you can see it has an inscription saying `` dailes muziejus '' - `` museum of arts '' . 
  antisemites are people who hate jews . 
  your comment is only etymologically relevant . 
   ca n't read the article either , it is in portuguese [ 21th century ... google translations are far from perfect , but easily understandable .

   yes , of course you were , latvia boy . 
  he probably was . 
  `` nazism '' on reddit means `` grammar nazism '' more often than not , and it made more sense this way here . 
  calling him `` latvia boy '' is rude , no matter how silly his posts mostly were . 
  also , the spd use `` genosse '' all the time , not just the communists . 
  according to this map : poorer than greece and cyprus , richer than bulgaria . 
  poorer than 2/3 of it 's featured neighbours . 
  you might want to choose a different map . 
  oh - i only now noticed that most ukrainian regions have this little purple dot in them ...

   recently minster of justice claimed that embryos from polish clinics were sold to germany , but he does n't really have a prove for it . 
  why would we buy your embryos ? 
  at least it all did n't seem so serious in germany . 
  i heard that some members of the french government criticized merkel and her politics , but people are doing that all the time . 
  i think most germans barely noticed this . 
   prime minister ayrault even tweeted in german ( he is a former german teacher ) . 
  i had to look this up . 
  `` without intensive and honest dialog between germany and france , we wo n't solve europe 's problems . '', 
  freundschaft zentral `` the german-french friendship is crucial for finding the route back to growth and to giving the european project new drive '' i think his german is better than my english . 
  alien time machine . 
  some people are . 
  honestly , if i lived in some village in [ lusatia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusatia ) , maybe with kids who often play outside , i think i would be concerned , too . 
  still , most experts seem to agree that healthy wolves do n't attack humans and germany has been free of rabies for some years now . 
  the biggest concern seems to be that wolves will sometimes attack sheep flocks , but this can be quite easily prevented by using good fences and/or dogs . 
  interestingly , yes . 
  [ why do n't have a look at it yourself ? 
  germany . 
  the map is very outdated , [ here 's a better one ] ( http://www.wolfsregion-lausitz.de/images/stories/rz-karte4_13.jpg ) , for germany and western poland only . 
  ( in german . 
  wolfspaar = pair , wolfsrudel = pack ), 
  germany . 
  the map is very outdated , [ here 's a better one . ],

  ] ( http://www.nabu.de/wolf/dt_wtpo_pop_gross_1.jpg ) so up to date , it actually claims to be from the future ... ( next tuesday ) - no idea how that happened . 
  it also shows wether there 's just a single wolf , a pair of wolves , or a breeding pack . 
  edit : or maybe you like [ this version better ] ( http://www.wolfsregion-lausitz.de/images/stories/rz-karte4_13.jpg ) , although it 's essentially the same map . 
   and macedonia was n't a small greek state , yeah , it was . 
  small by comparison with persia , and greek by what the macedonians would have said about themselves . 
  anyway , i think we agree about the * important * aspects . 
  i do n't know what it is with you and the horns . 
  for one thing , that 's not the * usual * way that alexander is depicted . 
  more importantly , though : these horns are the horns of the god amun-ra . 
  they are a sign of veneration , not a symbol of cruelty . 
   do you admire genghis khan too ? 
  far less . 
  genghis khan was * only * a conqueror ( as far as i know - mongol-fans , do n't bother me with contradicting details !, 
  ) , and an exceptionally brutal one at that , even by the standard of his era . 
  alexander was n't exceptionally cruel by ancient standards - just more successful than others . 
   he called the army `` psalm-singing uniformed defeatists '' for refusing to use poison gas during the bombings of german cities . 
  you make it sound like he ordered them to do it - he never did . 
  he started as the leader of a small greek state and within 15 years carved out an empire that stretched `` to the edge of the world '' ( in the eyes of his fellow greeks ) . 
  some of the cities he * founded * still exist today . 
  when he died , he was n't much older than i am today , yet after more than 2,000 years , you only need to say the name * alexander * and people know who you 're talking about . 
  there 's a lot to admire . 
  and no doubt , there 's also a lot to despise . 
  we are talking about a * real person * , after all . 
  nobody has been born in persepolis in all these hundreds of years . 
  yeah , sure . 
  but not the slightest effort was ever made to limit the attacks to the legitimate targets . 
  ( neither in dresden nor in hull . ), 
  nobody 's being born in persepolis anymore . 
  simple : not use area bombings . 
  saddam hussein was a genocidal lunatic with willing followers . 
  carpet bombing baghdad ( and kirkuk , karbala , tikrit , ... ) would still have been a war crime . 
  say what you will against the iraq war - nobody even considered this kind of attack . 
  of course , precision strikes using wwii technology still would n't have been all that * precise * - but the allies never even made an effort in this regard . 
  when you simply link to that article , i can only see that as you agreeing with sprash . 
  the attack on dresden ( as well as attacks on many other german cities ) was terror bombing . 
  of course , so was the attack on hull . 
  persepolis was once considered the most beautiful city in the world , before alexander burned it down . 
  still , i have quite a bit of admiration for alexander as well . 
  the russians insisted that the western allies should open a second front . 
  clearly they did n't think the war was already easily won . 
  i find it almost amusing that you are even being downvoted for this . 
  let 's see how deep we can go : even if you disagree with mongol_winter , there really is no reason to downvote theflyingbastard because of it . 
  there 's not really anything in the reddiquette about it , but it 's just basic decency and common sense . 
  ~ ~ not `` them '' - `` we shall fight on the beaches ... '' ~ ~ also , just to complete the `` set '' : [ never was so much owed by so many to so few ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/never_was_so_much_owed_by_so_many_to_so_few ), 
  i really would n't . 
  - stalin and hitler * cooperated * for a time . 
  - stalin did n't ever decide to fight hitler , he was attacked . 
  - stalin sacrificed more soldiers , of course , and his country suffered worse than churchill 's , but those are really the opposite of accomplishments . 
  - had you or i been in stalin 's position when the germans attacked russia , i 'm pretty sure we would n't have done much worse .
