  had any of us ( or almost anybody else ) been in churchill 's shoes after france was defeated , i 'm pretty certain england would have sued for peace soon , and the war would in effect have ended with a german victory . 
   he betrayed poland and its people i think that 's an unjust accusation . 
  by the end of the war , churchill was one of presumably very few people who wanted to keep fighting - against the soviets , to get a `` square deal for poland '' . 
  churchill is one of the political figures in history that i admire the most . 
  if you wanted to name one single person as `` the man who beat hitler '' , i think your only options are either churchill or hitler himself . 
  all major german cities were bombed , and most minor ones as well . 
  take cologne as an example : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_cologne_in_world_war_ii - bombed 262 times - sometimes by more than 1,000 bombers in one attack wikipedia as a few more articles like that , for instance for hamburg . 
  my own city , koblenz , only has [ a german article ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/luftangriffe_auf_koblenz ) . 
  87 % of koblenz were destroyed . 
  ( i think that 's unusually thorough , but almost all german cities were hit hard . ), 
  edit : wikipedia is a goldmine for this topic . 
  this might answer your question most concisely : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_bombing_during_world_war_ii#the_british_later_in_the_war, 
  barely . 
  does n't explain the vast differences between the countries . 
  it 's very difficult to fire people in germany , too . 
   `` how cold is ? 
  - very . 
  also dark '' . 
  this is the best * latvian * joke i have ever heard on reddit . 
  kein job in germany for you !, 
   if so , what are we waiting for ? 
  replicators , mostly . 
  we lack the * technology * . 
   the `` universal goal '' is no longer happiness or security or not having to work , but the ability to create and buy more material goods . 
  access to material goods is an important factor in what makes people happy and secure and allows them to enjoy their leisure . 
  up to a certain point , more material goods * does * mean more happiness and security . 
  just because you live on the good side of that point ( where more stuff does n't increase your happiness and security much or at all ) does n't mean we 're already there globally . 
  unemployed people in spain or greece are quite far from that point . 
  go to spain , find a well-educated , unemployed 20-something without much hope of a decent job and tell them . 
  we do * not * live in a startrek world yet , where everyone can simply have as much of anything as they like , without any humans actually working for it . 
  unemployment is real , and it makes people suffer . 
  i do n't quite believe that you even * can * say `` nationalsozialistische '' . 
  how do you feel about that ? 
  either i do n't understand what you 're saying , or you did n't understand the map . 
  `` greater than 40 % '' is the youth unemployment rate for spain , greece , and croatia . 
  germany is already not in that equation . 
  40 % ... that 's such a * horrible * number ... 
  i knew this , but it always make me sad when i read about it . 
  that feels to me like it 's almost the opposite of what was asked for . 
  when people accuse germans of being nazis , i always think these people are idiots , but i do n't really feel offended . 
  why would i ? 
  i know it 's not true , and i know that even they know it , even if they do n't care to admit it . 
  for me , it 's more the opposite : there seem to be many people who believe that you should n't talk about the nazis with germans . 
  ( `` do n't mention the war ! '' ), 
  the nazis are an interesting topic , why would n't you talk to me about them ? 
   we do n't even want to be in , support has never been above 30 % is that so ? 
  i really do n't understand why german ( and presumably other european ) politicians keep talking about `` giving turkey a accession perspective '' - there will probably always be a majority * against * this in all european countries . 
  i just was n't aware that this is even true for turkey itself . 
  ( i like turkey . 
  i still do n't want you in the eu , and i ca n't really understand why you would want in . ), 
  do you find it offensive when people joke around that everybody can speak italian [ * lik-a dis * ] ( http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/d2/e/aaaaanoh09waaaaaanlhsq.jpg?v=1203518296000 ) ? 
  is it really called that ? 
   7 day war man , that would have been fast . 
  it was the `` seven weeks war '' , though . 
  when germans talk about france , we quite often call you `` la grande nation '' - usually sarcastically . 
  most germans believe that you also call yourselves that . 
  how do you feel about that ? 
  they say it correctly , as far as i can tell : `` vive la france '' - * not * ~ ~ viv *** a *** ~ ~, 
  so the potato jokes are n't seen as offensive ? 
  ( or should i call them the `` no potato '' jokes ? ), 
  i wonder how european they feel ... 
  this is the most interesting news in the thread to me . 
  norway is * so * calm and peaceful that the biggest news is some nobody deciding to drink & drive . 
  benefits ? 
  i love these threads . 
  about the frequency : i think once a week will work out fine . 
  maybe the date should be stated in the title . 
  ( i mean , you can of course easily calculate it even for older threads . 
  still , convenience and all ... ), 
  i still do n't really get what the proposed law and the demonstrations are about . 
  gay marriage * is * already legal in france , right ? 
  one big thing seems to be the right to adopt - is that the core of the issue ? 
  he 's not a politican , though . 
  football manager . 
  you could argue that it would have meant rich people would pay less taxes if they hide their money in switzerland ( semi-legally ) rather than paying `` normal '' german taxes . 
  of course , they are n't paying * any * taxes on ( illegally ) hidden money right now . 
  but the spd decided that this could be used to make the government look bad , like they were trying to protect tax evaders . 
   they have ~ 7500 members and their launch has been highly publicised and covered in the media . 
  just to put this in perspective : greens and fdp have about 60,000 members , each . 
  7,500 is quite impressive for a party that has n't even been around for a month yet . 
  btw : the current coalition does n't have a majority in the bundes * rat * , and there is no two-party coalition that would have . 
   it really looks like afd is a big mad-house . 
  [ disclaimer : i do n't plan on voting for them . ], 
  they are not . 
  there 's nothing you can do about getting applause from the wrong people , but it 's not even true that they do . 
  during their founding convention , there was [ a demonstration by the right-wing npd ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/gruendungsparteitag-der-afd-in-wut-vereint-12149130.html ) * against the afd * right in front of the building . 
  ( a tiny one , but all npd-events are tiny . ), 
  i never heard of them being `` anti-gay '' . 
  `` anti-immigration '' means that they want a system as canada has it - terrifying . 
  they also demand * more * rights for asylum seekers , namely the right to legally work in germany . 
  if you try founding a new party in germany that 's not clearly to the left of the spd , there will always be people painting you as a nazi . 
  that does n't make you one . 
  so every motorist has to pay a little extra , not to save the environment , but to actually destroy it ( ! ), 
  - but that 's ok because it 's a part of the environment that you 're not interested in ? 
  very hard to tell . 
  they might mobilize quite a few voters who would otherwise have abstained - the majority of them former supporters of cdu and fdp , but also some who voted spd before . 
  the euro bailouts are n't that popular among centrist spd supporters , either . 
  also and more importantly , it 's impossible to predict the result of this election even without the afd . 
  [ a few recent national polls for the interested . 
  ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm ) in the polls , the coalition ( cdu+fdp ) and the combined opposition ( spd , greens , and leftists ) are almost tied .
