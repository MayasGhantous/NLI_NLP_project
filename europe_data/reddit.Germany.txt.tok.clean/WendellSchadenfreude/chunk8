  a majority for cdu+fdp would , of course , result in a continuation of the coalition . 
  spd+g reens , on the other hand , do n't want to form a coalition with the leftists - but they are nowhere near a majority without them . 
  even if the smaller partner of the coalition ( fdp ) should fail to get to 5 % - i do n't think there 'll be a majority without merkel 's cdu after the elections . 
  it looks very unlikely for the spd to become stronger than the cdu , so merkel would stay in office in a grand coalition . 
  - - - anyhow , how does the afd influence this ? 
  they might steal just enough votes ( or mandates ) from the coalition to prevent a cdu+fdp victory , thus forcing a grand coalition . 
  they might even push the fdp over the 5 % edge - but this would very likely still force a gc . 
  or they might be the only reason that there is n't even a mathematical majority for spd+g reens + leftists , thus undermining the spd 's negotiating position for a grand coalition . 
  known people - not so much . 
  bernd lucke , their newly elected chairman , is slowly gaining publicity now , but nobody knew him or anybody else in that party a few weeks ago . 
  what is notable is that they have the support of several hundred german professors of macroeconomics - i di n't think there 'd even be that many !, 
  calling them radical does n't quite seem to fit . 
  abolishing the euro would have drastic conqesquences , of course - but so does * keeping the euro * . 
  at the very least , the ( elected representants of the ) afd are certainly democrats . 
  and their arguments against the euro are * not * simply `` lazy southerners want to steal our money ! '', 
  or something . 
  [ i do n't plan on voting for them , btw . ], 
  most germans are not really aware of this , i think . 
  our debts as a percentage of the gdp are already shrinking , albeit very slowly . 
  germany is slowly gearing up for the national elections in september . 
  top stories at the moment are often about peer steinbr\u00fcck or about a new party , the afd . 
  steinbr\u00fcck is merkels challenger , candidate of the social democrats ( spd ) . 
  he 's not much loved among his own base , thus blamed for the spd 's currently rather poor performance in the polls . 
  if the elections were held any time soon , the most likely result imo would be another grand coalition cdu/spd , with merkel staying in office . 
  the afd is a new party in the making , has n't been in any election yet . 
  founded by a bunch of economics professors , their only widely known position is that they want to abolish the euro in some sort of orderly fashion . 
  since this is a popular opinion ( chiefly , but not exclusively , among conservatives ) they might actually clear the 5 % hurdle and get some seats in the bundestag . 
  - - - also : football , always a big story . 
  two german teams in the cl semifinals , yay . 
  for a moment there , i thought this was another thread about sentences that totally make sense today but would have made no sense at all fifty years ago . 
  you 're right , i never heard that before . 
  very interesting , thank you . 
  i tried finding out more about this on wikipedia , but i was distracted by something even more interesting ... [ the imperial german plans for the invasion of the united states ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_german_plans_for_the_invasion_of_the_united_states ) . 
  never heard of those , either ... 
  i spent a few month in lithuania , it always felt like they were rather proud of that part of their history . 
  they insisted that it was * their * country that strechted from the baltic to the black sea . 
  where were they from ? 
  hmmmmm what ? 
  yes , if germans know anything about our colonies , it 's usually about that genocide . 
  still , it does not have much influence on how we perceive the namibians today . 
  i think it 's not even that important for * how they perceive us * . 
  at least tell us which * country * wants to talk about something else ... 
  germany had colonies only for a short time , i do n't feel like they 've left a lasting impression . 
  most germans know hardly anything about our colonial history . 
  `` s\u00fcdwest '' ( namibia ) is still somewhat popular as a travel destination , and people who go there always seem happy about having met some locals who speak a little german . 
  not a coincidence , but the causality might be reversed : they did not want to be in the eu because they are so rich . 
  the sound people make when suppresing anger . 
  ( sounds a bit like a dog 's growling . ), 
  there is n't a bid like that `` every year '' . 
  there was one a few years ago . 
  before that , you have to go back to the 1950 's , when two extremist parties were banned . 
   oh , did n't knew abut their marketing . 
  well , go watch their [ us commercials ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv157ziinuk ) then . 
  they are hilarious . 
   stuttgart 21 there might be engineering problems with s21 in the future , but so far , they 're doing just fine - all problems were purely political . 
  there will almost certainly be some delays and extra costs - this happens in other countries as well , and it happens especially easily when the administration does n't really support a project politically . 
  keep in mind that this is an extremely ambitious project . 
  ( for those unaware of the project : in short , they are taking the main station in the center of a city , turning it by 90 degrees and putting it underground . ), 
  it 's the first * anyone * has ever heard of this newspaper . 
  if you google them , you get 1 - their own homepage 2 - their facebook page 3 - links that have nothing to do with them , usually about other newspapers . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_deutscher_zeitungen ) does n't know that this `` newspaper '' exists . 
  it 's just * weird * that anyone would use them as a source . 
  [ what are you even talking about ? 
  if you like game of thrones and do n't mind people thinking that you 're a nerd : no . 
  otherwise : you should probably say `` maybe '' or `` perhaps '' , `` mayhaps '' sounds very silly . 
  a thing for roughly 16 % of all students at any time - [ 424k out of 2.7 million - and they receive 448 $ per month on average . 
  a place in a prison will always be far more expensive ( for society ) than a place in a refugee camp . 
  refugees do n't get anything that prisoners do n't get as well , but they have to be supervised far less . 
   do crime = go to jail . 
  and receive free food and clothing there , at a much higher cost for the tax payer . 
  about the deconversion : you 'll have to organize something privately , european governments are n't allowed to interfere in religious matters in such a way . 
  do you want people to literally starve to death in denmark ? 
  you 're giving money to students ? 
   only 5 % of refugees are women , 75 % are men . 
  and 20 % percent do n't conform to binary gender norms . 
  want to known whom else turkey does n't fight ? 
  that 's right , al qaeda . 
  i never said turkey were fighting ypg . 
  but you shure are n't supporting them much either . 
  and the ypg have done a lot more against isis than turkey has . 
  no need to be rude . 
  he wishes that turkey would do more against isis , so we probably are all on the same side . 
  he also believes that turkey has already been doing more against isis than they probably really have , but that 's not something to insult him for . 
  the 1,000 + arrests were widely reported , and in the first reports , everybody thought that these were isis supporters . 
  it was only found out later ( and probably not widely reported in turkey ) that most of them were not . 
  that 's just the map that ( correctly ) shows the definiton of the * three worlds * during the cold war . 
  my link ( that is : wikipedia ) discusses different definitions of the * first world * . 
  if you insist , we can also call turkey a second world ( or [ `` 1.5 th world '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newly_industrialized_country ) ) country together with countries like mexiko and brazil . 
   turkey has arrested more than a thousand isis affiliates i would like to see a source on this . 
  but a source that has some details , please , because from what i hear , the majority of the recent arrests targeted kurds and turkish opposition groups , not isis . 
  [ see here , for instance . 
  ] ( http://time.com/3974399/turkey-kurds-isis/ )  last week , the turkish government announced it was joining the war against isis . 
  since then it has arrested more than 1,000 people in turkey and carried out waves of air raids in neighboring syria and iraq . 
  but most of those arrests and air strikes , say kurdish leaders , have hit kurdish and left wing groups , not isis . 
   they say turkey is now hindering , rather than helping , the fight against isis . 
  if you would want turkey to do more against isis , i have to ask : ** do you wish turkey would support the ypg in syria ? 
  ** because they are in fact the most effective force fighting isis , and turkish support could help them immensely . 
  nope . 
  but germany * is * 3,000 km away , and we did at least send weapons to the ( iraqi ) kurdish militias . 
  also , we are n't fighting anybody else at the moment .
