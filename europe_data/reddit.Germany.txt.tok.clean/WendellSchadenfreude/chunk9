  while turkey , just as the comic shows , decided that it 's just the right time to * pretend * to fight isis and actually fight the kurds instead . 
  by the way , i 'm not so much criticizing turkey 's inactivity as praising the kurds . 
  germany has also taken in more than 100,000 syrian refugees . 
  considering were almost [ 3,000 km away ] ( http://www.distancefromto.net/distance-from/syria/to/germany ) ( not 5,000 ) , i think that 's quite a lot . 
  but i was n't critizing turkey 's treatment of refugees . 
  turkey is doing alright on that front . 
  what turkey is * not * doing is fighting isis in any effective way . 
  since you stated reasons for this behavior ( fear of repercussions ) , it seems you are not even disputing this : turkey is not really fighting isis . 
  the ypg are . 
  it might be easy to patronize and criticize the kurds who are actually fighting isis on your comfortable turkish 1st world ass ( [ turkey is a first world country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_world ) , and you should be proud of that - not use it as an insult against others ) , but the world can still see that kurdish militias are fighting isis while turkey is not . 
  the turks also have their own airforce . 
  and they could also have the same american support , probably even more of it . 
  this cartoon also is very unfair because kurds ( the ypg in syria ) are actually the most effective ground force against isis , while turkey has yet to do anything useful . 
  for the most part , schengen countries could not prevent this . 
  find a case in which arab christian immigrants harassed or threatened arab muslim immigrants , and i 'll argue that we should deport * those * christian immigrants . 
  if such a thing ever happened , i did n't hear about it . 
  it 's always muslim immigrants who ca n't leave their barbaric beliefs in the countries they are fleeing from and thus turn even against other refugees . 
   or do you only want to apply that rule to immigrants ? 
  yes , obviously . 
  you ca n't expel a british neo-nazi from britain . 
  but why would we ever allow neo-nazis from other countries to migrate to britain/germany/europe ? 
  i think islamist extremism certainly * is * a huge problem for the christians mentioned in op 's article , who are in europe . 
  just like everything else that i 've ever seen her confronted with , she handled that better than most politicians would . 
  the german government coalition holds more than 500 seats in the 631 seat parliament . 
  they do n't have a problem voting * anything * through . 
  differences between spd and greens are far smaller than between spd and cdu . 
  the portmantubble is about to burst !, 
  the punwordination is not sustainable . 
  i 'm deeply cra-rried as well . 
  `` crarried '' is short for `` worried about the crash '' . 
  it 's gon na be worr-sh than you think . 
  ... damn , i did n't notice that ... 
  anyway , now we have two translations . 
   one of the countries that gave us this opportunity was a small nation on the mediterranean sea . 
  nope , that country really did n't have a say in this . 
   that is by the way the main reason why the military budget of greece was n't touched by the troika for so long ... 
  the greek military budget was 2.2 percent of the gdp in 2014 , but still above 3 percent ( up to 3.5 ) around the year 2000 . 
  it 's been cut far more rigorously than the rest of the greek budget .
