serbia 's not looking too bad , either !, 
  good point . 
  right , after all , the only thing that will stop a bad guy with a gun , is a good guy with a gun . 
  or in germany , a petrol station employee with a cable tie . 
  that 's obviously bullshit . 
  the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun . 
  your own source says two people , not `` several '' . 
  they rip on all the parties . 
  i 've seen die heute show making fun of everyone from the greens to the cdu . 
  they might have a bit more fun with the afd because they provide such great material , but they have been mocking merkel and seehofer since i started watching . 
  `` on a roll '' is how i know it . 
  i do n't have a tv , but i pay gez , so i watch die heute show and extra 3 on youtube . 
  both are good , but i prefer dhs . 
   can wait for / r/europe to remove this post . 
  yes , indeed you can . 
  it was a false flag . 
  the dublin convention says that a refugee gets refugee status in the first country he arrives in . 
  this is blatantly unfair towards countries with a mediterranean coast . 
  anyone who thinks that the german government should have said `` sorry greece , sorry italy , but crisis or not , these millions of refugees are your problem because dublin '' is not in touch with reality . 
  tell that to the bnp : http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/britain-s-biggest-import-tsunami-crime or the npd : https://npd.de/aufklaerungsquote-bei-einbruechen-viel-niedriger-als-bisher-angenommen/ https://npd.de/import-von-kriminellen-auslaendern-endlich-stoppen/ does n't matter who you are , there 's someone who thinks you 're a criminal because of your background . 
  that started out kind of like a dutch accent but somehow drifted into an afrikaans accent . 
  weird . 
  confirmed : still butthurt . 
  i do n't get that impression from this article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women_in_the_israel_defense_forces, 
  how do israeli female troops fare ? 
  i heard that they 're quite effective . 
  yes : they 're repatriating serbians , for example , because it 's safe for them to go home now . 
  well , because we will manage it . 
  we can absorb the numbers that came in , and even better if they can be distributed a bit better and then repatriated when syria starts recovering . 
  that 's not really true : it 's got some english mixed in , but it 's mostly flemish ( dutch dialect ) with drastically simplified grammar , a chunk of malay vocabulary , some german and portuguese influence , and the normal regularisation of irregular language forms that you get in creoles . 
  for example , the irregular plural `` ei / eier '' in dutch becomes `` eier / eiers '' in afrikaans , and the conjugation `` ik ben / je bent / hij is / etc. '', 
  becomes `` ek is / jy is / hy is / etc. '', 
  i know afrikaans and i understood all of it . 
  even more during peacetime . 
  you just see lots of visible technology being put into production during wartime , but actual long term development of things that make people 's lives better needs stability .

  but post brexit there will be no eu member state with english as an official language , so using it officially in european parliament business will be hard to motivate . 
  apparently he targeted foreigners . 
  yeah , but the fact that other eyewitnesses said that he shouted `` schei\u00df ausl\u00e4nder '' makes your `` confirmed '' a bit weak . 
  early reports say that the shooter was just confused about how to catch pok\u00e9mon .

  do you really want a failed state on the border of the eu with a string of dictators running it and getting purged in turn by their successors ? 
  because that 's what will happen if we let their economy `` really fail '' . 
  i 'd say that when the turkish government says stupid things like this , the european governments should plainly and directly say `` we will not allow any turkish politicians to hold public meetings in europe , and minister x saying foolish things in response will not change our minds . 
  his comments are an embarrassment to turkey , not to us . '', 
  i suspect that cousin might have been a goat . 
  microsoft did abuse their monopoly power , though . 
  they made oems pay a license fee for every processor they sold , otherwise they would n't be allowed to install windows on any of their computers that they sold . 
  they forced oems not to install netscape , and bundled ie ( which was horrible back then ) with windows . 
  they did embrace , extend , extinguish tactics to destroy open standards as much as they could . 
   maymay german confirmed !, 
  i heard on the radio that the reason that the german government had larger tax income in 2016 than 2015 was that the tobacco companies were producing as much as they could before the start of the law that they had to put big nasty pictures on the packs . 
  i must say , the new packs are pleasantly gruesome . 
  damn , when is the next heute show ? 
  so much hilarity to be had . 
  the afrikaans word `` swaap '' means fool . 
  i wonder what its etymology is .

  thanks to comrade / u/asmundr , the people of / r/de have been alerted to the fact that this war is simply a / r/karmaconspiracy among the mods . 
  to roughly translate the [ excellent post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/5hfd3n/mein_gesicht_wenn_ich_sehe_dass_der_gro%c3%9fe/db0bfx2/ ) by / u/esec _ 666 : comrades , trade unionists and dear social democrats !, 
  the french commenters need our solidarity .

  we are not op . 
  we are commenters and upvoters . 
  day in and day out , we run to our subreddits and labour through mountains of shitposts and memes . 
  and yet at the end of the day , we still do not have enough karma to offer anything to our hungry families . 
  brothers and sisters , unite !,

  i 'm disappointed that my hosts at / r/bayern have n't taken this opportunity to declare a socialist revolution yet . 
  eish , we do n't mind . 
  half of our army is busy with peace-keeping missions in africa anyway . 
  i was n't confused . 
  it 's clear that this is referring to the singular/plural issue . 
  the announcement reminded me of the famous `` ab sofort '' of schabowski . 
   police said no one took part in auction and it was unclear if herba was serious about the plan or whether he was a `` fantasist '' . 
  yeah , i do n't think this guy was thinking it through very well .
