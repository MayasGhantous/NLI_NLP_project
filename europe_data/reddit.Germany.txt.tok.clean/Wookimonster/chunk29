  i get that the euro is undervalued , but that does n't necessarily mean the dm would be worth more than the euro . 
  i 'm not sure on the process that would lead to the dm being massively valued . 
  why is that ? 
  got a paper i can read ? 
   from a continental perspective , 64.5 % of german exports by value are delivered to other european countries in the first one , that 's the only reference i find to europe . 
  i looked up german exports from wiki and it put it at around 1.5 trillion in 2014 . 
  this puts the european part at 967,5 billion euros . 
  i 'm currently looking for some data that tells us the exports to the eu . 
  in the second link i found this :  exports to france 8830253.00 eur billion is this an error on their page or are they seriously suggesting that germany exports 9 million billion euros to france ? 
  am i not understanding this ? 
  edit : i went to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshtableaction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tet00039&amp;language=en ) which gives germany a trade balance of 71 billion in intre-eu27 trade.this seems pretty minor considering belgium is at 25.7 billion and the czech republic is at 21 billion . 
  hell , the netherlands apparently has 177.6 billion . 
  i 'm confused . 
  is n't the euro , even now , significantly stronger than the dm ? 
  [ this graph ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/raoulruparel/files/2015/07/de-monthly-trade-upd.jpg ) it 's from a [ forbes article ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/07/22/bernanke-german-trade-surplus/#13c8546664f2 ) . 
  i 'm currently trying to find the underlying data . 
   these nazi cows were incredibly aggressive . 
  just do n't be a polish cow . 
  i 've been told this is because germany has n't really been around that long , while the different germanic peoples have been around for a long time . 
  well , he might actually see this as a compliment . 
  did somebody say [ gro\u00dfdeutschland ] ( https://kosmologelei.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/gross-deutschland.jpg ) ? 
  yes , while everyone is looking east at russia , we sneak back into poland . 
  for years they keep asking for nato military bases , soon they will have only german bases . 
  in all seriousness though , there is a lot of stuff that needs to be done . 
  for example , rather than keeping all units with 70 % of their equipment and then pooling it for whatever unit is needed , they could actually equip all of their units with all their equipment . 
  also , more stuff like fully integrating foreign units into the bundeswehr and vice versa , like the dutch armored units or the german sea units . 
  edit : i 'm also really surprised all of this is coming from van der leyen . 
  usually the defense ministry is seen as a place to put politicians that you do n't know what to do with . 
  hmm . 
  so is it done or is there more coming ? 
  for some reason i ca n't find anything in the german media . 
   domestic demand continues to point downwards maybe if wages went up , so would demand . 
  they damn well need it . 
  the hartz reforms were basically considered a stab in the back to the average worker . 
  i often hear the spd referred to as the traitor party . 
  the fact that the spd chancellor afterwards went off to work for gasprom left a pretty sour taste in lots of peoples mouths . 
  then there are pr debacles like declaring they would n't enter a debate where the afd is represented ... 
  seriously , the spd is just destroying itself . 
   many voters no longer identify the spd with the traditional social issues it was built on . 
  this is pretty much it . 
  they were a workers party and for some reason decided this was n't what the interests they should reinforce . 
   there 's broad consensus on the root cause of the party 's current crisis : its grand coalition with angela merkel and her center-right allies . 
  i 'm not convinced of this . 
  in 1998 they still polled at 40 % . 
  in 2002 they got almost 39 % and after that there seems to have been a steady decline . 
  in 2002 the spd and the greens ran the government . 
  seems to me they really shot themselves in the foot . 
   the chance of war in europe will increase if british voters decide ... to leave the eu what ? 
   economies in central , eastern and south-eastern europe ( cesee ) are poised to overtake the continent 's traditional economic powerhouses like germany and france in terms of rate of growth and employment the title of the article suggests something different , more along the lines of actually overtaking the larger economies .

  what else am i going to mount on my wall , a deer ? 
  that 's disgusting . 
  nah man , they are fat and lazy and like to yell . 
  also the stepdad joined and within a few weeks was a minister of some sort , mostly because he had a laminating machine and could make more `` official looking '' documents . 
  yep , they are as crazy as can be . 
  it 's okay , the armed forces of the kommissarische reichsregierung of [ german city i wo n't name ] consist of overweight people who yell a lot . 
  i 'll manage by going up a lot of stairs . 
  yes , but if i tip off the local authorities they might arrest him , even if he does n't respect their authority . 
  nah , he is on levels beyond this sub . 
  he 's actually a reichsb\u00fcrger , as in he gave away his german passport ( they sent it back to him as `` lost and found '' ) and is now using his `` pass der kommisarischen reichsregierung [ german city i wo n't name ] '' . 
  if i marry my girlfriend , we will do it outside of schengen where he ca n't travel . 
  i ca n't wait for my girlfriend 's crazy stepdad to tell me this is a plot by globalist forces to turkish troops on german soil and start the eradication of german culture . 
  hmm , i need to slow the fuck down . 
  as is tradition . 
  kind of looks like a french nyancat with a german rainbow coming out . 
  someone should make that . 
  wait , we can exchance the uk for australia ? 
  sounds like a deal . 
  it 's a reach , but it works . 
  that seems pretty crazy and farfetched , so i guess that 's what he said . 
  i 'm actually curious what he said . 
  how does one turn this shitty excuse for a project into immigration ? 
  i feel that anyone who says that abortion should n't be legal should be offering to adopt any mentally or physically handicapped babies . 
  damn , now that is some long term planning . 
  i guess it would be a very similar situation to the german reunification . 
  it used to . 
  im not really getting `` angry '' from that guys comment . 
  im confused . 
  70 months is almost six years . 
  should n't that mean it 's 2011 ? 
  please revive friedrich , not wilhelm . 
   `` bellen '' in german , this means to bark . 
  the singer sounds like a german version of sexual lobster from newgrounds . 
  that 's from 2014 . https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/14/spain-independent-scotland-would-be-at-the-back-of-eu-queue they say that scotland would have to apply like anyone else . 
  spain is n't staunchly opposed . 
  they said if such a referendum were accepted by the government of the uk , they would n't block it . 
  i mean , i 'd love it if they published their data ( anonymised obviously ) . 
  yeah , but the data was collected from different places . 
  there is no guarantee this data is collected every year in a central place . 
  they do n't actually care about all the `` lost land '' and whatever ( at least the ones i met ) . 
  they care more about not paying taxes and not having to follow laws . 
  well , this is a bit far out there . 
  but i think the us is the only first world country on that list . 
  while i agree the others are definitely worth mentioning , i also think that 's a difference . 
  i did say it 's a horrible thing to say . 
  it 's just that it does get most people to shut up . 
   why 2014 and not 2015 ? 
  it may well be that this data simply was n't compiled and therefore is not readily available . 
  or it may have shown something completely different .
