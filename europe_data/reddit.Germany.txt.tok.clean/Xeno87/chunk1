it did n't stand up to putin 's power grabs and he is by far more dangerous ( since turkey does not have nuclear weapons ) . 
  so i heavily doubt there will be anything done in that regard . 
  you need to invoke article 50 first, 
  it has been the rulebook since the russo-georgian war . 
  seeing a puppet being elected who called the baltics the mere suburbs of st. petersburg , i really fear for europe . 
  now throw in months of russian internet propaganda and wikileaks disinfo and you got your fn ruling . 
  and next year , lepen is going to become president of france . 
  the uk is cut off from europe , france under the control of a putin puppet , the us too - and just like that there are no nuclear weapons anymore against putin . 
  and now it marks the end of nato and transatlantic partnership . 
  funny , because 30 is exactly the percentage by which [ right wing extremist attacks ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/rechtsextremismus-gewalt-101.html ) rose in 2015 . 
  it means `` czech box of matches '' . 
  [ here you can hear the pronounciation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3efpbydd4o ) . 
  do n't be silly , [ of course there is !, 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/f5e3aeg ) now that you mention it , it _ is _ weird that poland has never used it ... 
  that 's actually a pretty good.point . 
   call me what you want , if wanting self governance for scotland makes me a nationalist then so be it . 
  it feels weird calling the snp `` nationalists '' when they have repeatedly made it clear that they would like to see scotland remaining in the eu . 
  all while the actual nationalists are busy trying to ignore every action and instead try to hide behind labels . 
  what , you wan na be on top now ? 
  well , our former chancellor is best friends with putin , paid by his companies and even disbanded the department `` organized crime eastern europe '', 
  i like you too , poland . 
  [ here , you might want to know what a corporation from a foreign entrepreneur is . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legal_personality ), 
   the law does n't apply to everyone equally . 
  you might want to check in what country you live . 
  the law applying to everyone equally is the basis of a constitutional state . 
   well people might just be opposed to the notion of foreign investors being treated equally as a local investor in the first place . 
   the law does n't apply to everyone equally well , i sure as hell have a problem with that . 
  you can sue `` a country '' ( more correct : a government ) already . 
  treaties allowing such a thing date back into the 60 's ( and you are still living in a healthy country , right ? ) . 
  the thing about this is : there does not exist a world court . 
  therefore , there does not exist a court for a entrepreneur to sue a government , for example if a competitor of said entrepreneur was elected to president and made a law disciminrating his enemies company . 
  and since somehow people are opposed to things like a world court , literally the best possible solution as of now are investor-state dispute settlement tribunals , where two parties agree on a tribunal to settle such disputes . 
  guess what putins strategy in syria is ? 
  i would be ok with a referendum if everyone allowed to vote has studied economics , domestic and international law . 
  i want to remind everyone that a direct armed conflict between russia and nato will end in a nuclear war . 
  as soon as one side starts losing , it will resort to nukes . 
  when checking [ these 14 defining characteristics of fascism ] ( http://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm ) , putin and his russia fulfill every point . 
  anti-america , anti-eu , anti-globalization . 
  they are happy to ignore the fascist stuff . 
  which breaks down to a de facto criminalization . 
  it 's one of those bigot moves to bypass a straight-out criminalization by law while achieving the same , so it can be pointed out proudly that it 's totally legal and all the ( western ) critics are wrong and russiaphobe . 
  great , now it is a severed arm in a pile of tasty potatoes . 
  my last state of knowledge is that it should n't , since the commonly used isds approach was replaced by a _ permanent _ multinational court to settle disputes like this . 
  i was actually quite surprised that they managed to agree on a permanent court . 
  on a related note , isds and the arbitral tribunals/courts that come with it is not a bad thing either . 
  most people probably do n't know this , but those artibtral tribunals where a company can sue a country have been around since the end of the 50 's . 
  and even though they are not perfect , they are the very best solution we have , since there does not exist a `` world court '' . 
  * edit * : [ found a source ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-399_en.htm ) . 
   ceta establishes a permanent tribunal of fifteen members which will be competent to hear claims for violation of the investment protection standards established in the agreement . 
  the members of the tribunal competent to hear investment disputes will be appointed by the eu and canada and will be highly qualified and beyond reproach in terms of ethics . 
  divisions of the tribunal consisting of three members will hear each particular case . 
  the ceta text now follows the eu 's new approach as set out in the recently concluded eu-vietnam fta and the eu 's ttip proposal . 
  as far as i remember there is another clause stating that the tribunal members are not allowed to appear as experts or party counsel in other investment cases . 
  ah yeah this is a tough one , i remember this coming up around 2013 . 
  but it should n't be that much of a deal because such a situation occurs everytime with trade agreements . 
  got ta read into that one though . 
  so instead of actually giving a quote from the ceta text that i could explain or put into context , you simply say `` investor-state dispute settlement is bad '' , provide me sources that smoking is more harmful than hormone treatment and completely deflect from the entire topic . 
  if you do n't want to talk about ceta , then do n't write comments about it . 
   the gist of it is that we 're endangering our quality regulations and our sovereign right to implement a new ones care to show us the lines of ceta which implement such bypassing ? 
  this is a pretty strong claim you are presenting here . 
  what about you show us a line in ceta you do n't like and we try to find out why it maybe is n't as bad is you think ? 
  for example , i had one guy stating that ceta would allow canadian meat from hormone treated cattle to be exported into the eu , even though here hormone treatment is not allowed . 
  but ceta still does n't allow this ( there is no bypass for regulations ) and the solution to this problem for example was that the canadian cattle breeders ( is that the correct term ) will adopt the eu regulations in return for guaranteed export quanitites . 
  india is bigger than greenland , even though the projection on a map makes greenland appear 4x bigger . 
  damn you , topology !, 
  seriously do n't know why this is getting downvoted . 
  helping the kurds would even be morally justified . 
  [ sorry , no refunds after 20 years ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ), 
  yeah , it 's becoming increasingly hard actually to remind myself to distinguish between `` putin 's russia '' and `` russia '' . 
  i seriously can understand now why the european countries did not easily forgive and trust germans after the war . 
  yeah , interestingly he already said exactly what he was up to during the [ 2008 nato summit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_bucharest_summit ) , when georgia and ukraine applied for nato membership . 
  he openly stated that several regions of those countries like crimea , the donbass or abkhasia would revolt and break away and join russia if those countries got into nato . 
  already back then everyone understood this as a clear threat . 
  well , luckily the uk , germany and france veto 'd the application ** out of respect of russian concerns ** . 
  never appease russia . 
  ** never ** . 
  you ca n't negotiate with putins russia and you ca n't make it cooporate . 
  this lesson i learned by now . 
   do we have any casualty statistics on chechnya under whats-his-name the dictator ? 
  when you do n't even know the dictator of chechnya , then i 'm not surprised that you consider this the `` best case scenario '' . 
  have you ever heard of the dunning kruger effect ? 
   this list is incomplete ; you can help by expanding it . 
  you can add those , it would quite help . 
  the list in its current state can be abused as a propagandistic tool . 
  it 's a repitition of the russian strategy for chechnya . 
  [ bomb everything to shit ] ( https://informnapalm.org/de/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/05/227.jpg ) and have an authoritarian nutcase rule over it who is deeply devoted to f\u00fchrer putin . 
  i think there has never been a single year without terrorist attacks in europe since the 60 's . 
  [ here 's a list if you wan na take a look ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_europe#list_of_incidents ) . 
  it 's almost impossible on a continent with more than 50 countries and 700 million people . 
  imagine the deep , almost everlasting respect western societes would earn if those refugees could return to their homecountries and live in a democratic , open society without authoritarian nutcases ruling . 
  but no , let 's just russia and assad bomb syria to shit , turn it into another chechnya and then kick out all refugees calling them terrorists . 
   p-3 orions can carry nuclear depth charges the orion was able to carry the b57 , which was decommissioned in 1993 . 
  the f-16 can carry weapons like the b-61 , [ but there are no such weapons in the baltics ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/articlepictures/nucleareurope.jpg ) . 
  funnily , we should then consider all russian planes and ships to be nuclear threats , too , right ? 
  and on top of this , everything nato has stationed in the baltics that can _ theoretically within several days _ be used to carry nukes , russia has all of this , too , in a much higher amount and then it also [ has actual warheads in that region ] ( http://www.nonproliferation.org/a-second-sighting-of-russian-tactical-nukes-in-kaliningrad/ ) . 
  so nato would need several days to do a nuclear strike with the weapons and systems in the baltics , while russia could do that instantly . 
  any proof of this ? 
  putin always was pissed off . 
  _ always _ .
