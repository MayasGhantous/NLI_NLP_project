  ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/14/dispatches-jail-time-being-gay-russia ) let 's play a funny game , shall we ? 
  let 's look at the results if we search for `` gay + [ country ] '' on youtube : [ gay germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gay+germany ) [ gay united states ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gay+united+states ) [ gay poland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gay+poland ) [ gay russia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gay+russia ) guess what terms result in overwhelmingly positive videos , and what term results on overwhelmingly negative ones ? 
  let me give you a hint `` russia : gay men beaten on camera '' , `` anti-gay campaign shows russia 's worst side '' , `` russia : gay activist is attacked by paratroopers on national holiday '' , `` russian violence against gays caught on tape '' ... 
  that looks weird . 
  i 'd say it appears to be a power struggle - apparently putin made a decision ivanov did heavily disagree with . 
  i do . 
  that 's why in another [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4xc7sm/vladimir_putin_is_using_kgb_tactics_in_crimea/d6eduui ) i explained my reasoning :  i 'll only answer so people who do n't know about this stuff have at least read it once . 
  i 'm not arguing with or trying to convince him , i 'm advertising my position to an audience . 
   anschlussing part of the territory in europe in xxi century would be considered a fiction 10 years ago . 
  what about chechnya or moldavia ? 
  also , please note that this was only 2 years before putin openly threatened to invade ukraine and georgia during the [ 2008 nato summit in bucharest ] ( https://newrepublic.com/article/116885/putins-been-wanting-crimea-2008 ) . 
  this was n't fiction 10 years ago , this was already planned and ready to be staged . 
  was it a bee from africa ? 
  lol , you literally do n't know the answer to all that stuff ? 
  like seriously ? 
  i 'll only answer so people who do n't know about this stuff have at least read it once . 
  because you are so incredibly uneducated that it hurts , you do n't even know about chechnya . 
   where 's putin 's cult of personality ? 
  lol , nice try troll . 
   where 's putin 's mein kampf ? 
  foundations of geopolitics , completely accurate so far . 
   where 's a minority that is systematically discriminated in russia ? 
  oh dear , you 've never been to russia , right ? 
  ever heard about the treatment of asians or gays ? 
   where 's putin 's race ideology ? 
  see beforementioned foundations of geopolitics , panslavism . 
   where 's yellow stars on clothes of this minority ? 
  did n't exist in 1938 , dipshit . 
   where 's museum of putin sculpture and arts ? 
  ** means , goals and politics **  where 's putin 's full-scale invasions 1938 , landgrab of austria and sudetenland which mirrored perfectly the landgrab of crimea , eastern ukraine , moldavia , south assetia and abkhasia , i linked it to you before and you did n't even read it . 
  full scale invasions , see chechnya . 
  i wonder how soviet propaganda would portray this if it happened today . 
  the fact that all nato countries have troops stationed/rotating in eastern europe should show you that this is not true . 
  [ ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1in7vcoqwc ), 
   there is no objective difference between those two politicians in their ** means , goals and politics ** . 
  did n't they teach you how to read ? 
  also `` dumb comparisons '' . 
  lol , why ca n't i hold all these arguments . 
  [ that 's the second time within 5 minutes i needed to use this image . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/yagpxpd ) damn you reddit , stop defeating me in debates !, 
  [ those two groups have quite an overlap . 
  [ ... ] ( http://img.memecdn.com/speechless_o_2899449.jpg ), 
  sometimes i wonder how quiet and decent social media would become if we 'd cut off russia from the internet . 
  good that you say it , because he 's literally hitler in [ early 1938 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudetenland#sudeten_crisis ) and [ late 1938 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudetenland#sudeten_crisis ) . 
  there is no objective difference between those two politicians in their means , goals and politics . 
  you think syria is `` a new thing '' ? 
  [ think again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_civil_war ) . 
  you think russia intervening in syria is any different [ from germany intervening in the spanish civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/condor_legion ) ? 
  you think [ guernica is any different from aleppo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/bundesarchiv_bild_183-h25224%2c_guernica%2c_ruinen.jpg ) ? 
   an increasing number of europeans and americans are willing to discount russian aggression i want to note that [ 81 % of germans do n't trust putin ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-03/vertrauen-russland-umfrage ) . 
  weird , because those are pretty rare for me here in germany . 
  the only ones that say this are guys from the former soviet union who live here since they were kids ( their parents usually disagree with them ) . 
   let 's pick an actual historic example wait , are you thinking that i made this up ? 
  [ this is no joke , it actually happened  ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/comparing-jewish-refugees-of-the-1930s-with-syrians-today.html )  that caused jewish refugees to be `` extraordinarily , excruciatingly vetted [ . . ] `` the state department worried that among the jewish refugees there would be nazi spies , '' [ ... ] . 
  `` there was hysteria about fifth columnists coming in with the refugees . '' literally ** all ** arguments against taking in refugees that are presented today were already said like this before and during ww2 about jewish refugees . 
  no it 's like ww2 when american politicians scare mongered that between all those jewish refugees from europe were thousands of nazi terrorists . 
  no , i just know a bit about things . 
  for example , that you do n't believe terrorists when they say `` oh look this is totally the way we send our attackers to you '' , when the actual terrorists are people with valid passports living here since birth . 
  isis terrorists do n't come in crowded boats , they fly first class . 
  yeah , because that 's exactly the way it goes . 
  ever read up about the attackers of ansbach or w\u00fcrzburg ? 
  which contains as much truth as when the neckbeard at high school brags about fucking his girlfriend from canada . 
  the reason they say this is because by wasting our intelligence and budget on scanning innocent people , they can easily work with their actual attackers - people that live in europe since birth , with valid passes . 
  people who go to holiday in turkey , train in syria and then enter the eu again by plane , in business class and collecting bonus miles . 
  the occasional 18 year old virgin refugee full of raging hormones that got angry because his application takes month to process while he is n't allowed to go to school or work , gets radicalized by internet propaganda and finally snaps is just a mere amateur that isis gladly calls `` a highly trained hardcore assassin to crush the evil imperial west '' , even though he never got training , weapons or money from them . 
  ** tl ; dr : do n't trust terrorists when they open their mouths **, 
  well , or it 's a usual scare mongering argument to grab more funding . 
  if there 's ** evidence ** , where are the arrests ? 
  or are they to incompetent to do their job ? 
  well , give me one of yours . 
  you keep the biochemist and give me the lawyer , since you really are n't made for that job . 
  deal ? 
   sure a landgrab in todays world is still fucked up , but everyone is making this sound like russia is germany anno 1939 . 
  hello , meet my fellow historic friends , [ anschlu\u00df ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anschluss ) and [ sudeten crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudetenland#sudeten_crisis ) !, 
   immediately after the anschluss of austria into the third reich in march 1938 , hitler made himself the advocate of ethnic germans living in czechoslovakia , triggering the `` sudeten crisis '' . 
  luckily , the west acted just as smart and decisive as it acts today and allowed hitler to grab those pieces of land with people living there welcoming germany . 
  everyone understood that czechoslovakia was corrupt as shit and that this started this whole issue . 
  sure , such a landgrab in yesterdays world is still fucked up , but everyone is making this sound like germany anno 1938 is germany anno 1939 . 
  wonderfuly , thank you for pointing it out !, 
  i knew there was something wrong with that guy , but i did n't find something in his post history - but you did !, 
  thanks !, 
   is n't the the shariah unconstitutional ? 
  ** tl ; dr : believing things that are illegal or working to make them legal is not unconstitutional , but resorting to terrorism or criminal actions to make them come true is ** no , at least not explicitly . 
  the thing about unconstitutionality in germany is that it is very tightly bounded to organizations or people . 
  it does not just mean `` people having beliefs that are opposed to current law '' , but more like `` parties or organizations whose intent and reason it is to abolish or fight constitutional law and are actively working on achieving this goal '' . 
  to declare an organization unconstitutional is bounded to really high hurdles where it is necessary to prove that the organization actually aimed to commit crimes or fight the constitutional state , was about or already commited such actions etc. 
  if you can prove this in court , the organization can be delared unconstitutional and then you can ban their unique and distinct symbols , successor organizations ( those are then automatically banned and do n't require a new trial ) and seiz _ all _ assets . 
  the thing is that having beliefs that contradict current law is not uncostitutional . 
  the belief that women are inferior or that gay people should be allowed to marry is not illegal and even creating a party that seeks to translate these beliefs into law would not be unconstitutional , even though current law fobids discriminating women or allowing ( full , legal ) gay marriage . 
  but if those parties would plan to commit terroristic attacks or assassinate people to achieve these goals , they would be unconstituational and could be banned . 
  declaring a religion unconstitutional is not possible ( the law does not have the means for this ) , but extremist organizations can be - like the one that was raided i think 1 or 2 weeks ago and currently faces trial for this . 
  there 's also a little problem with the language barrier here : german law has two meanings for `` unconstitutional - verfassungs_widrig _ and verfassungs_feindlich _ . 
  if i had to find corresponding translations , the first one would be unconstitutional in the sense i explained and the latter would be `` extremist '' . 
  it 's more like `` actively violating the constitution '' and `` believing in things that would violate the constitution '' . 
  but to be able to ban an organization it must be unconstitutional in the first meaning , purely being extremist and having extremist beliefs is not enough ( however it would be enough to justify monitoring by the police etc ) . 
   but it seems you guys are catching up . 
  one could almost think you are happy about terroristic attacks . 
  well , out of curiosity , exactly how many terroristic attacks did we suffer in germany which were committed by attackers wearing a burka ? 
  and while we are at it , how is a burka ban , if for some really magic legal piece became reality , supposed to prevent a terrorist attack ? 
  are the predominantly male attackers going to just drive up to a target location , with guns and explosives ready , only to realize `` oh shoot , we ca n't wear our al-quaida-approved male islamist burka uniforms because it 's against the law '' and just call the entire thing off ?
