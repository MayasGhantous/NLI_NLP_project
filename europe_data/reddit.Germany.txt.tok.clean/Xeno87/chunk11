  well , or it is a statement which is perfectly valid if you have a bit of knowledge about ( german ) law and legal definitions . 
  a bit further below i wrote a comment clarifying this a bit , expressing the strict , tight legal definition of `` symbol of an unconstitutional organization '' . 
  while i agree , i 'd like to point out that the reason for `` winter markets '' in most cases ( at least the ones i know of ) was n't an initial ban targeted on religous festivals , but more profoundly , because those markets often last way longer than just over the time of christmas holidays and thus are not mere christmas markets anymore . 
  [ it sure as hell is a bulk phenomenon ] ( http://img.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-05/bitblt-820x701-a292c9fbfa7260e590983a96e344d0ab288879f1/jaehrliche-asylantraege-deutschland.jpg ) . 
  after the 1993/94 ygoslavia refugee crisis , influx of asylum seekers sank to such a low degree that the migration statistics of germany was negative for nearly a decade . 
  the fact that you do n't know that shows that you are too young to even remember this last refugee crisis and too poorly informed to talk about it . 
   provided that use of them for that purpose does not fall within the initial prohibition . 
  well then you seem to be a shitty lawyer because this distinction is a pretty huge one compared to what you had before . 
  not only does this imply that during winter , all muslim women can run around with their burka again without fearing any consequences since they can plausibly deny the intent to be wearing it for religulous reasons by simply pointing out that it 's cold outside and they are wearing cold weather masks . 
  nope , it also would require every single violation to be interpreted in court to see if wearing a piece of cloth to cover the face had the correct intent . 
  also i do n't believe that uk law has a distinction , tight legal definition of `` halloween mask '' . 
  and fuck , i sure as hell do n't believe for a second that you are a lawyer . 
  looking at our past `` actions '' , i 'd rephrase this as `` if we react '' . 
  again : the burka is a piece of cloth . 
  it is not a symbol i can paint . 
  it is a piece of cloth , exactly like a balaclava . 
  if you want to ban a burka you would have to ban wearing a piece of cloth over your face which is exactly the reason why i even asked my original question - how to ban the burka without banning all other or a wide range of masks . 
  and then , `` unconstitutional organization '' is a really tight term in german law . 
  it 's not just a phrase , it means that an existing organization , with members and funds and headquarters , was investigated thoroughly _ in court _ , which in turn declared its unconstitutional intent , actions and goals , _ carefully _ reasoning and assessing benefit and detriment of banning the organization as a whole . 
  it does not mean `` this group has plans to commit crimes '' or `` this group has ethic beliefs that contradict current law '' , because then , all those right wingers would be in deep shit already . 
  so in this context , cold weather masks are illegal in belgium ? 
  sigh . 
  so many people who have never even read a law . 
  so if all muslim women that wore a burka before start wearing balaclavas it 's not a problem anymore ? 
  if you do n't know how laws work , do n't comment . 
  that 's no rocket science , either . 
  laws do n't work like this , thankfully . 
   you already have precedent with banning swastikas . 
  this is completely different . 
  the swastika is a distinct , unique sign of an unconstitutional organization , which then allows a ban . 
  a burka is not , it is a piece of cloth . 
  the german law does not have the means to ban this . 
   within the framework of sports practices , festivities or ** artistic ** or traditional manifestations . 
  so i could just wear a burqa by calling it a piece of ( performance - ) art ? 
  `` an artistic rendition and admonition of opressed women by islam '' ? 
  while i agree , i do n't think it is necessary or very productive to write in all caps . 
  and how should such a law look like ? 
  i 'm serious , all formulations i could come up with would make it illegal to wear a halloween mask or a cold weather mask in winter . 
  and here goes the play again . 
  election drama in the us , olympics in rio , everyone 's distracted - let 's poke a bit to see how far we can go without a real reaction . 
  [ i dunno , it worked quite well in turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_turkish_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat#american_involvement ), 
  [ the 1980 coup in turkey lol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_turkish_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat#american_involvement ) . 
  restoring democracy is a negative thing now ? 
   oh for fucks sake interestingly , i had the very same reaction . 
  maybe nato should orchestrate a _ real _ coup in turkey . 
   you do n't need proof , everybody knows ahh , the classic . 
  _ `` the past was alterable . 
  the past never had been altered .

  oceania had always been at war with eastasia . 
   siemens says its joint venture is only for making turbines for a separate plant on russia 's taman peninsula , which is separated from crimea by a strait , but not for plants inside in crimea itself . 
   however , three separate sources told reuters that two power plants in crimea are being built to house siemens turbines . 
  the sources , who are all familiar with the technical details of the plants , said they are compatible only with siemens turbines . 
  no shit ? 
  sanctioning crimea but not the entirety of russia can be exploited ? 
  color me surprised !, 
  exactly . 
  you _ never _ burn bridges in diplomacy . 
  yeah , welcome to / r/europe when there was a killing ... 
  but about the `` different sects '' thing , this is exactly what was written in the article and i translated it accordingly i think ( `` different islamic denominations '' ) . 
  the article also explicitly states that both victims were muslims . 
  at the moment , everything is just pure speculation . 
  police arrested an alleged murderer , but they did chose not to release any information about him or the victims yet ( except for age and nationality of the suspect : it 's a 36 year old man from tunisia ) . 
  this is a bit unusual , but authorities say it 's because they were not able to notify the relatives of the couple yet . 
  europe is _ huge _ . 
  the eu alone has 500 million inhabitants . 
  even if one knew in what country one should look for them , chances of finding them are incredibly small . 
  after all , they lived in germany several years ( exact numbers were not told ) . 
  i could imagine that the couple still had contacts with some trustworthy family members ( after all , it 's family ) who then accidentially or intentionally spoiled their location . 
  but that 's all just speculation , let 's see what the investigation brings . 
  actually , this is what i would expect coming out of this . 
  two families , belonging to different sects of islam , both part of the local mafia and having a family war since two generations or longer . 
  might be the reason the police does not yet want to confirm the identities of the victims or the alleged murderer . 
  well , let 's see what investigations bring . 
  and not being able to look for the actual , underlying problem is pathetic . 
  the thing is , i do n't think this whole `` marriage not accepted because different sects of islam '' is the entire story to it . 
  the couple got married in tunisia already , i 'm damn sure the two families lived along each other for quite some time , and even though they were following different sects , there probably happened much more . 
  know those stories of families living in the same town that literally always clash and have feuds ? 
  i 'm farily certain this here is the same thing , not only were they part of different sects but there were a lot.more incidents in the past were those families clashed and fought . 
  i just want them to cover `` highway to hell '', 
  the couple was actually seeking refuge in germany because of their forbidden marriage . 
  the fled their own relatives . 
  it 's more a romeo & juliet story . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4w93g1/tunisian_couple_in_leipzig_dismembered_their/d653quc ), 
  attempted a translation :  leipzig . 
  light comes into dark a few days after two dismembered corpses were found in a quarry pond in leipzig . 
  according to sz ( _ ~ ~ s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung ~ ~ s\u00e4chsische zeitung _ ) , the victims appear to be a young tunisian couple whose marriage was not tolerated by their families out of religious reasons . 
  the two muslims , who apparently were members of different islamic denominations , are said to have fled from their own relatives to germany and applied for asylum several years ago . 
   investigators of the special commission ( _ soko _ ) `` bagger '' searched the social apartment of the couple in volkmarsdorf , where the gruesome double murder may have taken place . 
  forensic technicians with a sniffer dog seized extensive evidence . 
  divers are still looking for missing body parts in the quarry pond in leipzig-thekla . 
  body parts in a plastic bag were found on thursday by swimmers at the site . 
  also , it is normal here to enter the bus not through the door right besides the driver [ but through the door in the back ] ( http://assets.inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/03/primove-wireless-induction-charging-germany.jpg ) .

  this happened 6 days ago , why is it posted now ? 
  you * do * realize that 34.7 % of refugees are under 18 and that this statistic does not differentiate between men and women ? 
  * edit * : also there is a legal differentiation between `` fl\u00fcchtling '' and `` asylbewerber '' . 
  * edit2 : * [ here ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/kurzanalysen/kurzanalyse3_sozial-komponenten.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) are some more detailed statistics ( only in german , sadly ) . 
  according to this , in 2015 one half of asylum seekers was married , roughly 3/4 male . 
  18 % visited a university , 20 % a higher school ( gymnasium ) , 32 % high school ( mittelschule ) and 22 % primary school , 7 % did not have a formal education .
