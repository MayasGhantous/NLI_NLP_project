  47 % of asylum seekers were from syria . 
  do n't have the time now to write down other numbers , maybe someone else can go on . 
   russia will not be annexing the baltics . 
  i think it will as soon as there is a president trump . 
  i 'll wait for the presidential elections before making life changing decisions . 
  but i can still use my freedom of movement as an eu citizen for holidays there :p, 
   what does mean geopolitical shock exactly ? 
  because on wikipedia it seems like it was fueling separatism this was the idea of the author in 1997 , _ 19 years ago _ . 
  that there will be other means , i.e. 
  a syrian conflict with millions of refugees or a turkish military coup , could 've hardly been imagined by duqin . 
  the overall goal is to destabilize turkey , weaken it enough to get it out of nato and get political/geostrategic control over it . 
  how 's the kurd situation in turkey ? 
  i 'd say this is looking pretty good so far . 
   uk wo n't be cut off from europe as it was stated several times by uk and eu politicians . 
  well give it time . 
  it already leaves the eu which sure as hell can count as `` getting cut off '' . 
  there 's a reason rt is focussing so hard on the uk . 
  this is n't over yet . 
   ukraine is n't annexed to russia and it wo n't happen after russia having annex crimea and backing separatism ( neither will it become a cordon sanitaire ) . 
  frozen conflict that can get hot again as soon as the opportunity is ripe . 
  the same with georgia . 
  this plan is way , _ way _ too far accomplished than it should be . 
  i 'm not afraid of getting downvoted by [ kremlins ] ( http://images.digopaul.com/wp-content/uploads/related_images/2015/09/09/kremlins_3.jpg ) . 
  i will post whenever i want , not when _ they _ want . 
  [ this sounds familiar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) :  russia needs to create `` geopolitical shocks '' within turkey . 
  sounds about right - there were some shocks and now comes the quiet time again . 
  let 's see what else was accomplished :  united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
   ukraine should be annexed by russia [ ... ] ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible  georgia should be dismembered . 
  abkhazia and `` united ossetia '' ( which includes georgia 's south ossetia ) will be incorporated into russia . 
  georgia 's independent policies are unacceptable . 
  looks like all is going according to putins plan . 
  and then an agreement was reached . 
   this year stayed with cloudy sky empty many points between the car , ** at least 10,000 people died ** a massacre !, 
  i 've grown to like the baltics states even more the more i read about them . 
  i 'm really excited how this little countries ' presidency will work out . 
  if i was n't so pessimistic/paranoid about russias grasp for those 3 countries , i 'd probably move there . 
  but sunnis are n't a homogenous group as you make it sound like , sunni islam is again divided into [ hanafi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanafi ) , [ hanbali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hanbali ) , [ maliki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maliki ) and [ shafi'i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shafi%27i ) . 
  satire ? 
  [ it 's dead serious !, 
  ] ( https://noharmspilt.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/trump-clown.jpg ), 
  oh what , do you have proof that those people are murderers ? 
  then you better give that to the police , since they would like to have such an evidence . 
  innocent until proven guilty , ever heard of that ? 
  well , history has proven the ban of groups in germany to be a success . 
  a ban means that all assets of the group are seized and thst every new organization formed by former members can ( and legally is ) immediatly banned as a successor organization , which would allow those people to be jailed . 
  this group does not consist of refugees . 
  the people in this group have german citizenship . 
  this group would exist no matter the current political situation . 
  lower saxony has 7.774 million inhabitants and 24.000 of them are policemen . 
  there are ~ 500 salafists in lower saxony . 
  this equals 0.006432 % of the population , and every salafist is met by 48 police officers . 
  yes , i 'm damn sure that wir schaffen das . 
  more police staff , because when monitored people can commit a crime , then there probslably were n't enough officers there to monitor . 
  i 'm not a fan of breaking the laws . 
  i want courts to judge , not reddit . 
  i guess you wanted to write `` warned '' ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 'd assume the `` neue presse '' was just hasty to write a story that the local government will now target salafists more precisely . 
  they were probably the first newspaper to get their hands on information about this due to an inside source and wanted to profit from that . 
  i guess they only had information that authorities will be investigating the society further , but did not expect the police to do a raid the next day . 
  no problem . 
  though i guess this will be deleted because it 's only local news . 
  can we please go back and bitch slap all those `` i told you so '' - nutjobs that would n't shut up until the shooting was over to spurt their bullshit ? 
  so when are we considering all the shit russia does as an act of war ? 
  when are we banning russia from swift ? 
  when do we set up a full on embargo ? 
  it 's a nato effort to overthrow putin !, 
  the heroic firefighters are literally fighting fascism !, 
  poor poland can not into chart . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uz3j5/400_police_officers_in_raid_against_radical/d5u50ye ) . 
  not much information though . 
  so , there 's not much information in it : swat and local police stormed a mosque and 8 apartements in hildesheim belonging to a radical salafist group ( deutschsprachiger islamkreis , dik ) to seize evidence which would justify a ban of that society . 
  authorities believe the group to have radicalized several young people to make them fight in the war in syria . 
  out of the 22 people from hildesheim who went to syria to fight , 15 were dik members . 
  the federal office for the protection of the constitution considers this group to be the `` jihadistic-salafistic hotspot of the republic '' . 
  secretary of interiors , boris pistorios ( spd ) , seeks to ban the group , which was welcomed by opposition parties ( cdu&fdp ) , even though they consider the local government to have acted too late . 
  * edit * : according to [ ndr ] ( https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/hannover_weser-leinegebiet/polizei-durchsucht-hotspot-der-salafisten-szene,salafisten308.html ) ( german source ) , the very linked paper `` neue presse '' reported a day before the raid that authorities planned a blow against the group ( _ personal note _ : so it might be possible that the group had enough time to destroy evidence ) . 
  there 's a little bit more information about the group in this article , it states that the society exists since 4 years and was monitored by authorities for 3 years . 
  from the 74 lower saxonian people who travelled to the area of isis , 19 are thought to have been radicalized by this group . 
  it is accused of preaching `` hate against infidels '' , a former chairman of the group is accused of having actively fought in syria for isis . 
  authorities consider a bit more than 500 people in lower saxony to be salafists . 
  this wo n't happen , it 's a little bit like the abolishing of child slavery : industrials back then cried and cried that they would not be able to compete anymore , thst they could never make profits . 
  well , the only thing that such a ban did was shifting the economic balance a little bit , and the market found a new balance again . 
  the same will happen here - they providers will still make insanely much money even when not being able to artificially inflate their profits by using a geoblocking scheme . 
  woah , try telling that those right wing nutjobs after those 18 , 19 year old refugees or muslim boys did stupid shit . 
  they will disagree . 
  nice . 
  can we expect other studios and content providers to follow ? 
   proving essentially that nothing is sacred for them . 
  what , are you surprised ? 
  he actively targeted `` non european '' people . 
  he was a white supremacist ( lol , as half iranian ) and called himself aryan . 
  he considered it an honor to be born on the same day as adolf hitler and worshipped breivik . 
  he meets every criteria for a neo nazi . 
  yes , but you can choose what `` religion class '' to attend . 
   arms export data , un reports , plane tracking , and weapons contracts examined during a year-long investigation reveal how the munitions were sent east from bosnia , bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , montenegro , slovakia , serbia and romania . 
  sooo ... what countries were especially loud against taking in refugees again ? 
  the lesson to take away here is the same as during the yugoslavia refugee crisis of 1993/94 : stop dismantling refugee centres and letting off social workers once this crisis is over . 
  we had enough capacities at the end of the yugoslavia refugee crisis , then we had 20 calm years , and instead of thinking `` oh hey , there could be an other refugee crisis soon '' we acted as if there wo n't ever be any refugees anymore . 
  well , then 2014 came and we did n't have enough refugee centres , social workers or imigration officials to properly process the people .
