  no sorry . 
  this undermines _ my _ consitutional rights . 
  and i 'm no terroist . 
  well , fuck me i guess ( or hope ? ) . 
  find way to solve this without cutting my constitutional rights and we may talk about it . 
  because laws and courts . 
  trust me , i 'm totally in for arresting all fn voters and followers on the ground that they are radicalized , joined a group and are plotting to abolish democracy , but there are laws which prevent me from making my dream come true . 
  if you want to know why you do n't get thrown into jail for attempting to join isis , then try to formulate a law which would give a court such a right . 
  and then spend a day trying to inflict maximum damage by applying this right in a democracy . 
  * edit * : or better , try to find the court records from his trial . 
  let 's see what was said during his trial , what _ he _ said , what the general attorney said . 
  that 'd be most interesting actually . 
  also , how old was he back then ? 
  was n't he a minor ? 
   no he does n't stop spreading misinformation . 
  [ he relies so hard on russian money that he does n't want to release his tax returns ] ( http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/07/25/george_will_trump_doesnt_want_to_release_tax_returns_because_he_is_deeply_involved_in_dealing_with_russia.html ) . 
  make him release it , then we will see if he 's a russian puppet or not . 
  germany showed the whole world what happens when you let authoritarian right wingers roam . 
  does n't really look like people paid attention though . 
  you really need that `` paid commentator '' thing to make your embarassingly simple worldview work , right ? 
  how about you read some confirmed news about stuff you do n't like . 
   i doubt putin and erdogan would be really friends with trump , even if they do praise him a lot currently in the russian-backed media . 
  [ trump heavily relies on russian money , which is in the hand of putins close friends ] ( http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing ) and several of his closest advisors have close ties to putins russia . 
  seriously , when ** two ** russian secret services ( gru and fsb ) are hacking and undermining the democratic party , you ca n't really say that trump wo n't be friends with putin . 
  i 'd say he 's his puppet . 
  i seriously question that they do all this just to `` please their imaginary friend '' . 
  they want to make their own organization , their own `` state '' great , they want to make our societies weak and foremost , they want to show how powerful they are and how weak we are . 
  they want to change something , achieve something , make it known - the friend in the sky , ah shucks , that 's a bonus they gladly take . 
   if the us and allies stopped arming , training and financing the `` moderates '' russia would not have even been involved . 
  shows what you know about this conflict : absolutely nothing . 
  russia , from the very beginning , was involved by supplying and backing assad as well as ** blocking every single un resolution or international effort in syria ** . 
  arming , training and financing would have never been necessary if russia had n't blocked everything . 
   if the eu used the 3 billion for secure places for the refugees in syria and help them build a life again , things might look better . 
  which would mean we would have to make russia stop bombing hospitals and refugee camps . 
  let 's hope that this does n't result in dead hostages . 
  _ oceania was at war with eurasia : therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia . _, 
  shhhh , do n't confuse him with logic . 
  through massive funding and a propaganda machine by the kremlin , thus being able to constantly advertise their positions in an overproportional way ? 
  you are right , currently we ca n't definitely say if it was an intended suicide or not . 
  but since the attacker already tried to commit suicide before , it sounds plausible . 
  let 's see what investigation finds out , maybe he left a suicide note or pamphlet . 
  still you :  dehumanization often ignores the target 's individuality  thier book is n't fictional to them , it 's fact . 
  you have quite a problem when you make all muslims the same entitiy . 
   so anywhere where islam is preached ? 
  thier book is n't fictional to them , it 's fact . 
  i do n't think you understand how religion works . 
  i do n't think you have ever spoken to a muslim before . 
  * edit * : also , congratulations . 
  you unlocked the dehumanization achievement . 
   video games tell you to kill people in the game , not real life [ cough cough . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_ ( video_game \\ ) ) well , good that you do n't go to chernobyl because of a video game . 
  because now you should know why simply reading a book or playing a game does n't make you blow yourself up , even if it explicitly tells you to . 
  _ things just do n't work that way . _ to blow yourself up you require far more than a fictional piece . 
  you need people who constantly reiterate and reinforce stereotypes into you , you need an environment where those radical thoughts can be expressed without consequences , you need people literally enabling you to give up on human emotions and sympathy towards your victims . 
  basically it 's exactly that shit that was the cause for the holocaust : [ _ dehumanization _ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dehumanization ) . 
  a game or a book ca n't bring you to that point , otherwise we would have thousands of breiviks , millions of crusaders and could n't even leave the house because of all the killing . 
  gta v , postal or manhunt also told me to kill people , yet i did n't do it . 
  either i blame islam _ and _ videogames for killing sprees , or i do n't blame any of them . 
  ca n't do anything else without being a hypocrite . 
  yeah , about `` islam mativated him '' : are you one of those guys that blamed video games for the columbine shooting ? 
  because fictional pieces like books or video games do n't make people murderers . 
  but other people constantly reinforcing hate in you and making you believe that others are worth less than you , those make murderers . 
  people make other people blow themselves up , not books . 
  clearly , you ca n't even read my comment . 
  can you show me where i stated that ? 
  well , it is the first _ suicide _ bomber in germany . 
  we already had bombings before ( islamistic as well as others ) . 
  and we had man more that were prevented . 
  * edit * : i think the biggest bombing in modern germany so far was the [ oktoberfestattentat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oktoberfest_terror_attack ) in 1980 with 13 deaths . 
  but again , not a suicide bomber , at least not intended . 
  [ no , i 'm gon na link you to some facts about the attacker . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uf6eg/explosion_in_ansbach_germany/d5pfpla ) of course , you will just ignore all the mental illness part . 
  what measures ? 
  [ the number of asylum seekers declined by 66 % compared to last year ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/zahl-der-asylbewerber-in-deutschland-sinkt-drastisch-a-1086090.html ) , due to the arrangement with turkey . 
  what other measures do you think of ? 
  because there are n't many that our laws allow . 
  the german `` duldung '' puts a few resitrctions on the denied asylum seeker . 
  for example , they are only allowed to move in their current _ bundesland _ ( federal state ) . 
  this can be extended with a working permit , but those are also quite hard to get in such a position , since both , the asylum office and the job agency have to give a permit and the person needs to have lived here for at least three months . 
  there are more bureaucratic hurdles to it , but i think this is uninteresting here . 
  oh no , we do n't . 
  we analyzed and discussed numerous times , we discussed it during the 1920 's east jew refugee crisis , the us discussed it during the jewish refugee crisis in thr 30 's , germans discussed it again after the war and we discussed it in 1993 during the yugoslavia refugee crisis . 
  we discussed this over and over and over and over and over again and we always arrive at the same conclusion that let 's us have our refugee laws like we have them now . 
  there is nothing to discuss if you would read up on all those discussion , which i am pretty sure you wo n't . 
  [ we should 've never appeased russia in the first place . 
  ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/nato-got-nothing-from-conceding-to-russia-in-the-past-why-should-it-cave-to-the-kremlin-in-2016/ ) and we are still doing it - people are calling for an end on the sanctions , all while russia finances all extremist parties in europe and bombs hospitals and refugee camps to the grounds to make more refugees come to us . 
  the fact that this country still was n't banned from swift is horrendous . 
   which of these attacks were done because bible said something stupid ? 
  i ca n't see any evidence that this stabbing here was committed because the koran said something stupid . 
  which is kinda hard to prove , and i would be pretty surprised if something like this would actually happen . 
  because i do n't think that pieces of fiction can make a person a murderer , just like videogames do n't make anyone kill someone else . 
  [ refugees are just as likely to be criminal than germans ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/fluechtlingskrise-bka-stellt-steigende-kriminalitaet-fest-vor-allem-von-rechts-a-1062661.html ) ( german source , but google translate does a good job ) . 
  [ a nice statistic shoowing the number of refugees ( red ) and number of crimes ( green ) are not strongly correlated ] ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-921674-galleryv9-cvjv-921674.jpg ) . 
  [ more recent official study to this ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/kurzmeldungen/lage-kriminalit%c3%a4t-kontextzuwanderung-1-2016.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) . 
  so , concerning :  the number if stabbings from refugees exceeds the rest although their population is much smaller . 
  why the fuck do you lie to me ? 
  yeah , otherwise they would have to pretend it was a false flag mossad attack or something . 
  lol , it 's funny to see how you guys are desperate to make this one here stand out . 
  funnily , i do n't even have [ to go much back in time to find a machete attack ] ( http://www.tagblatt.de/nachrichten/attackemit-machete-294189.html ) - 5th of july . 
  yes , that makes it better .
