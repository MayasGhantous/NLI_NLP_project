  alright , gon na remember that the next time i get into an argument . 
  stabbing and fleeing - ok , stabbing and more stabbing - not ok . 
  well , at least you should consider it one when you ignore this one here . 
  otherwise you 'd be a hpyocrite ... 
  ah , would n't have mattered , i 'm currently flooded with [ masterstrokes like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4udnh4/man_with_machete_kills_a_woman_and_injures_two_in/d5oy7va ) . 
  how dare i compare stabbings to stabbings . 
  [ nope ... ? 
   one man stabbing another with a knife after a dispute . 
  again , not really comparable . 
  you actually have n't even read [ articles about the refugee stabbing ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/reutlingen-macheten-angriff-offenbar-eine-tote-und-verletzte-a-1104483.html ) ? 
  one man stabs another with a knife after a dispute is apparently not comparable to one man stabbing a woman after a dispute . 
  i must admit i 'm actually ashamed to have put that one in there ... 
  well , you either ignore this refugee stabbing like you ignored the other ones , or you condemn all refugees for this stabbing and condemn all germans for the others . 
  because everything else makes you a hypocrite . 
  stabbings are actually normal , it 's the media attention that makes it seem unusual . 
  this one gets attention because the attacker is a refugee , [ here i have a list ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4udnh4/man_with_machete_kills_a_woman_and_injures_two_in/d5ovxqk ) of similar stabbing incidents during the last 8 days . 
  interestingly , nobody seems to have a problem with that . 
  you seem to not know the difference between individual doping , team doping and federal operated , nation wide , secret service assisted doping . 
  so , this basically means that as soon as a russian athlete wins a medal , the other athletes can sue on reasonable suscpicion . 
  if isis needs to buy its guns on tor , they sure as hell are a shitty terrorist organisation . 
  i really doubt they would risk buying from police honeypots on tor when they are controlling huge oil businesses in iraq and syria , enabling them to buy guns directly from saudi arabia or countries in their neighborhood . 
  [ see comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u7qke/munich_gunman_was_obsessed_with_mass_shootings_no/d5ohymp ), 
  :p / u/heffernan7 said that , as a turk born and raised in germany , he expresses his utmost respect , to which i replied that this was n't actually a big deal and that i 'd rather had been a decent guy from the beginning instead of fucking up so much . 
  after all , in terms of `` political maturity '' i am only on a stage where basically all other , decent people already are . 
   ** keep my political opinion for myself until the shooting is over and we get solid information . 
  police confirmed that there was only a single attacker and that the reports about two other gunmen were due to civil cops responding and being mistaken for attackers - panic only sees a gun . 
  because the police was so swamped , it took a while to resolve that . 
  ha ha , i 'm one step ahead of you - i 'm already doing something similar at my university ( helping and supporting students with an unusual background ) . 
  but i 'm actually considering getting into [ exit ] ( http://www.exit-deutschland.de ) , the german organisation for neo nazi leavers . 
  also thanks for that idea , it 's a smart suggestion !, 
   i also got bullied a lot by the `` cool '' russians who went to the hauptschule for not loving russia and putin das macht dich gleich sympathisch :d, 
  this is exactly why i 'm taking such an interest in those stories . 
  i can relate to this guy just like i can relate to that refugee that attacked people with an axe - they are stupid , alienated and full of hormones , and it could 've just as well be me . 
  hey , danke man !, 
  [ i wrote a bit about it here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4u7qke/munich_gunman_was_obsessed_with_mass_shootings_no/d5nkyot ) . 
  it 's actually a boring story . 
  this is actually a boring answer : i was a stupid , unemployed school drop out , full of hormones and too much time . 
  it all became better when i got a real job after a few years which kept me busy the whole day and exhausted in the evening ( actually , the job was an apprenticeship by court order - basically either this or jail ) . 
  i saw my `` friends '' less and less , i had contact with muslims , poles , whatever foreigners and had to get along with them . 
  this made everything much better , and calmed me down enough to get my school diploma ( abitur ) . 
  those 3 years of school for adults were the best thing ever . 
  i learned so much i did n't know before , opening my eyes and showing me how absurdly stupid i had been out of pure ignorance and absence of information . 
  which makes my little rants and `` discussions '' with right wingers on reddit quite personal - it 's like arguing with my stupid , old self . 
  well , in that case the shooting would be over and he could not seriously harm anyone anymore , he would remain stationary instead of fleeing which would make it only a matter of time for the police to find him . 
  sounds pretty damn good . 
   i still believe that we _ can not _ all live in peace together was this intended ... ? 
  but thank you very much for the kind words . 
  as an ex-nazi , it actually means a lot to me . 
  i 'm tired of all that damn hate , be it my own or the one from others . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  they are building their own imaginary world and there is literally nothing we can do about that . 
  well , except marking them as dipshits on res to see how often they are dipshitting . 
  you are 10 and 20 years late for that respectively , it 's islam now . 
  also he had psychiatric treatment ( [ 1 ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/muenchen-liveticker-zu-schuessen-in-einkaufszentrum-oez-alle-news-a-1104388.html ) , german source ) and [ it was mentioned ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich22july/comments/4u4f0g/video_of_people_offending_the_shooter_screaming/d5ms168 ) that he apparently failed his abitur ( school diploma ) . 
  but reddit told me from minute 1 that this was an islamistic attack , that we must purge all muslims or refugees and that i 'm a liberal shithead for wanting to keep my political opinion for myself until the shooting is over and we get solid information . 
  i fucking hate those brigading fucks from / r/european and / r/the _ donald leaking into this sub whenever a squirrel lets a wet fart . 
  it 's like they ca n't stand it when some shooter gets more attention than them . 
  literally 3 weeks before this you had [ a shooting in serbia ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/02/serbian-cafe-shooting-man-kills-wife-and-four-others ) with 5 dead and several hurt . 
  it 's called a hyperbole . 
  no , but i have the decency to shut up until i get confirmation . 
  and you are an idiot for not even waiting until the bodies are cold to spurt your agenda . 
  you have as much morality as isis . 
  or we could build a joint eu army with a strategic nuclear command and use france 's nukes . 
  yes , quite easily . 
  but if you do n't already own such things because you are scared to get robbed or assaulted by drunk people , you have no real reason to get those against radicalised idiots . 
  the number of robberies and assaults are way , way more higher than the number of islamistic attacks and will be in the foreseeable future . 
  also you are more likely to get killed in a car accident . 
  im now _ really _ curious if there is anything incriminating against russia in there . 
  because i kind of suspect wikileaks would cut stuff like that out . 
  must i include a sarcasm/german humour tag ? 
  i thought we were on quite a sarcastic streak . 
  so weird . 
  becaude people said that german culture is uncompatible with democracy and would always fail . 
  it 's all those weird mountain countries !, 
  bavar_ia _ , austr_ia _ , switzerland ... _ ia _ ... erm ... ** sand !, 
  muslims !, 
  terrorists !, 
  to be fair , it seems like that the entire nato/us commitment to the 1980 coup was foreknowledge and maybe logistic/secret service support . 
  but still , i theoretically could imagine a nato intervention in turkey . 
  but i must admit it appears really unlikely . 
  [ * cough cough * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_turkish_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat#american_involvement ), 
  good point . 
  but please note that germany was also invaded and it certainly did not end like those other three countries . 
  if you really _ want _ it to work , you can make it . 
  but that country ends with '' - ia '' !, 
  so there surely must be sand and terrorists and muslims !, 
  an actual military coup . 
  maybe even with nato backup . 
  but i seriously question we will see this . 
  [ just learn from nazi-germany !, 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/01/turkish-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-hitlers-germany-example-effective-government ), 
   after the cold war , as relations normalized , we should have integrated russia into nato . 
  what , you mean like the nato-russia council , or the nato-russia founding act , or the osce ? 
  like , deciding on regulations , for example that maneuvers with more than 10.000 soldiers have to be registered in advance and the other side be notified ? 
   mistakes where made on both sides the last decades . 
  yeah , you know what was the biggest mistake ? 
  trusting russia in the first place . 
  remmeber the [ nato summit 2008 ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/nato-got-nothing-from-conceding-to-russia-in-the-past-why-should-it-cave-to-the-kremlin-in-2016/ ) ? 
  i do !, 
  russia even was there .
