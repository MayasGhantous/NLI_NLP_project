  well , and back then there was the idea that georgia and ukraine _ might _ apply for a nato membership . 
  putin threatened that parts of ukraine and georgia would break away and join russia if those countries would get a nato membership , which was a very clear message - * we will make that happen * . 
  the georgian war and the ukrainian war were threatened back then by putin . 
  well and what did nato ? 
  germany , france and the uk veto 'd the application of ukraine and georgia ** out of concerns about russia ** . 
  well look how far that brought us . 
  do n't tell me there were mistakes on both sides . 
  this here is a no brainer . 
  but then again , is n't it kind of an honor that they want to come to you and to nobody else ? 
  if he was affiliated with is , he should easily be able to get one , right ? 
  `` we should highlight speculation , not facts '' . 
  that this guy did n't have a gun , that 's a fact . 
  just as him having only a handmade flag . 
  this being an islamist attack is pure speculation , which [ even bavarias minister of internal affairs , joachim hermann ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/a-1103621.html ) admits . 
  this not the place nor the time to speculate , which you advocate we do . 
  a _ handmade _ flag . 
  that 17 year old could n't even buy or get his hands on a real flag so he made one himself . 
  pretty much shows what he was : a stupid , angry teenager wanting to feel great , powerful and go out with a bang . 
  his only connection to is was probably the internet . 
  but it nicely shows that our weapons laws work pretty good . 
  unlike the shooting in willingen , this guy here could n't even get his hands on weapons . 
  why would they , they could just ask their ministry of sports to provide them a clean urine sample . 
   im personally glad that we stopped interfering since the end of ww2 either you are trolling or you are mixing up ww1 and ww2 . 
  i 'm just sitting here with my popcorn waiting for all the `` russophobia '' comments or people who do n't know ( or pretend to not know ) the difference between individual doping and a state-organized doping program . . 
  ... are you guys trying to make me feel guilty for not studying for my physics exam tomorrow ? 
  i came here to procrastinate , not to do physics !, 
  must be shitty not to be able to judge laws and persons as abstract concepts and not with gut feeling . 
  yeah , so when someone is a legitimate refugee ( whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean ) then you consider this law stupid and ridiculous , right ? 
  because there 's a reason that we let public officials with knowledge about the countries of origin and a decent education decide wether someone is a legitimate refugee or not and not some reddit comment . 
  so you are shaming refugees for being refugees ... ? 
   would of  would not of been that comment is either moronic or brilliant trolling . 
   well yeah , between two even equal applicants , making a choice in favor of refugee only because he 's a refugee will be a discrimination which is illegal in germany and european union in general . 
  not only this , [ employers are legally not allowed to choose refugees over eu citizens ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/when-refugees-want-to-work-in-germany/a-18737104 ) . 
   an asylum seeker who made it to germany may not work during the first three months upon arrival . 
  and then they only stand a chance if no german or european union citizen is in the running for the job . 
  [ ... ] once the person has been in germany for ** 15 months ** , they do n't have to be submitted to this test . 
  well it 's either that or the fact that there are high barriers for refugees to legally be allowed to work . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/when-refugees-want-to-work-in-germany/a-18737104 ) for an article on those barriers and [ here ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-04/refugees-integration-germany-support-encourage ) for an article talking with and about refugees with that problem . 
  but let 's check the important things :  an asylum seeker who made it to germany may not work during the first three months upon arrival . 
  ok , so a refugee that came to germany in january 2015 can expect to work in april 2015 . 
   and then they only stand a chance if no german or european union citizen is in the running for the job . 
  well fuck . 
  it 's highly unlikely that there is _ no _ eu citizen applying for such a job at the same time is our refugee . 
   once the person has been in germany for 15 months , they do n't have to be submitted to this test . 
  so from april 2015 we are now at juli 2016 to have a remote chance of getting a job , even before any interviewer looked at our cv and skills . 
  well fuck . 
  you mean the other 3 putsches in turkey ? 
  guess they turned out pretty good when they left a democracy for erdogan to bring down . 
   i wish them lots of luck with that because there is so much propaganda from all relevant sides involved stongly disagree . 
  there 's exactly _ one _ side providing _ all _ propaganda in that matter to distract from what happened . 
  it 's quite sad , but if i stumbled upon a polar bear i 'd probably shoot quickly , too . 
  especially when it 's a hungry one , as this one sure as hell was - you do n't swim 200 miles when there 's plenty of food . 
  those creatures are dangerous as hell and i never want to meet one in person . 
   worst is the foreign media is reporting these exagerated claims can we make a list of the agencies who reported this ? 
  i really do n't like blaming `` the media '' when it 's a few idiots i can explicitly name and shame . 
  which is a no brainer when a government installs a federal doping program . 
  that invalidates all doping tests this country ever conducted . 
  well , except for the athletes who were training out of the country and conducted their tests there , those are lucky cause their tests still are credible . 
  you root for the one that is putsching ( sounds weird ) and simultaneously do everything you can that his putsch leads to your democratic victory . 
  for every day life in other countries , that 's damn relevant . 
  but putin has nukes , erdogan does n't . 
  i 'd take erdogan over putin because of this . 
  is n't turkey considering to apply the death penalty ? 
  in that case , is an eu member even allowed to extradite people who are to expect death penalty ? 
  ban russia from swift . 
  for china i 'm not so sure , there are much smarter people than me who have enough knowledge to come up with stuff . 
  it 's incredible , russia and china are slowly starting to claim entire regions as their own while the western world just looks away . 
  not only this - it basically anihilated the hopes of a world free of nuclear weapons . 
  no country in the right mind will ever again give up it 's nuclear arms in return for guarantees and treaties . 
  thinking that there ca n't be another war is the first step to one . 
  also , i can speak with almost absolute certainty that there will be another war in the balkans . 
  if mankind does n't eradicate itself , the next war is just a matter of time - give it 100 years , or 200 , it will happen inevitably . 
  the only thing we can do is to make sure it will take as much time as possible . 
  he 's very highly educated . 
  he knows words , he has the best words . 
  he has the best , but there is no better word than supine invertebrate protoplasmic jellies . 
  right ? 
  there is none , there is none . 
  there 's no , there 's no , there 's no word like that . 
  how many `` theories '' did russian propaganda present us ? 
  i stopped counting , but it felt like close to 20 . 
  this is something that worries me very much actually : the soviet union also did shit and tried to cover it up . 
  but their propaganda was to tell one , single version , an alternative to reality , an alternate truth . 
  putins propaganda is just out to destroy truth by telling so many stories that the true one is buried beneath layers of content . 
  it stands metaphorically for the differences between the soviet union and the putin regime - the su wanted to create something , another world , a socialist one , it wanted to compete and out-do the democratic nations , it actually had a ( shitty ) goal . 
  the putin regime only wants to destroy until there is nothing left other than what putin wants . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong , i totally am a supporter of a strong nato . 
  but i also think it 's kind of unfair how much the us stems on its own . 
  you mean when russia violated the budapest memorandum and the guaranteeing powers did not intervene ? 
  yes , exactly this i consider `` not reacting in a powerful way to foreign agression '' . 
  ... you do realize that france is a nuclear power , right ? 
  this would be really great actually . 
  foremost , it would get rid of inefficiencies and redudancies . 
  but then , it would also enable the eu to react to foreign agression , such as russia , in a more powerful way and would relieve the us a bit from `` doing all the work '' in nato . 
  i can totally understand why he acts this way . 
  but that does n't make it good or right . 
  i do n't want to see a thermonuclear war , but putin is currently doing everything he can to raise the possibility for one . 
  he is removing fail-safes where he can , which is extremely dangerous . 
   `` some hint that the `` buzzing '' of uss donald cook by russian su-24 fighter-bombers on april 14 , 2016 was meant to be part of a broader series of russian confrontations against western ships in the baltic , '' says international affairs analyst peter coates . 
  `` but the russian baltic fleet in april , however , refused to follow such dangerous orders -- hence putin 's retaliation against his own naval officers . '' so he gets rid of exactly those people that would prevent a direct confrontation .
