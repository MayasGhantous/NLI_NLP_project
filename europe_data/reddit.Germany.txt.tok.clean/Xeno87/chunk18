  imagine if [ stanislav petrov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_petrov ) , the guy who prevented a thermonuclear war , would have been fired for doing so . 
  or [ vasili arkhipov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasili_arkhipov ) , who did exactly the same during the cuban missile crisis . 
  putin is purging ( yes , that is a reasonable choice of word here ) his army of all those who would do the right thing and creates a not independently thinking , obedient war machine . 
  that is not good , not good at all . 
  ok , someone make a minesweeper version out of it, 
  totally not biased at all :  this reached a peak with the false narrative of events in ukraine , in which blatant evidence of the west 's complicity in a violent coups d\u2019\u00e9tat was omitted from corporate media accounts , while russia 's assistance to eastern ukrainians resisting the coup has been framed as a russian `` invasion . ''  the disinformation campaign has reached the depths of popular culture , including the eurovision song contest and sports doping scandals , to ensure widespread popular support for u.s. intentions against russia . 
   the russian `` aggression '' narrative , based largely on lies of omission , has prepared the way for the u.s. to install a missile-shield in romania with offensive capabilities and to stage significant nato war games with 31,000 troops on russia 's borders . 
  for the first time in 75 years , german troops retraced the steps of the nazi invasion of the soviet union . 
  yes , really . 
  because * you are no judge * you do n't know german law * you do n't know legal precedents * you have not heard the victims testimony * you have not heard the accused persons testimony * you do n't know what the prosecution asked for in fact , [ you know absolutely nothing ] ( http://media.peakprosperity.com/images/yir2015-image002.jpg ) , dipshit . 
  a nice `` fuck you too '' . 
  oh , wonderful find !, 
  thank you !, 
  it is extremely surprising that only the track and field athletes are targeted by this . 
  seeing that this was a government backed , secret service assisted doping program , basically every doping test conducted by russoan authorities within the recent years must be treated as void . 
  where everyone is an experienced judge , laws do n't matter and context is not necessary . 
  yep , i only talked about donations from individuals . 
  there 's also donations from companies , membership fees and government funding ( that 's the real deal here ) . 
  the government pays political parties a certain amount of money for every vote they got and _ also _ money for every donation they managed to get up to a maximum of 150 million . 
  ( [ have fun reading into that stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_finance_in_germany ) ) . 
  using the term `` leftists '' is quite a give away , too . 
  there 's a huge difference in tone between calling someone `` leftist '' and `` left wing supporter/extremist '' . 
  makes me wonder why i so , so rarely stumble upon `` rightist '' . 
  sorry , do n't know that - german party finances are quite a mess . 
  i 'm glad that i found this simple article on it . 
  but please note that i am only referring to donations from private persons , companies usually are donating higher amounts , also the parties recieve membership fees and federal subsidies to finance themselves , so their budgets are _ way _ higher than that . 
  nothing proven yet , but it _ is _ striking - afd has very close ties to russia ( e.g. 
  gauland frequently visiting the russian embassy ) , constantly calls for russian positions . 
  then , they used a kind of gold trading to circumvent the german party financing law which allegedly came from russia ( [ one source ] ( http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/moskau-und-die-afd-parteienfinanzierung-aus-russland-oder.1818.de.html?dram:article_id=344384 ) , [ another one ] ( http://diepresse.com/home/politik/aussenpolitik/4606286/russlandconnection_auch-afd-soll-profitiert-haben ) ( both in german ) . 
  rumors had it that it was the gold which went missiing from the national bank of ukraine during maidan ) . 
  then , afd reported to [ have collected 3.1 million $ ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/afd-nimmt-laut-bericht-3-1-millionen-euro-an-spenden-ein-a-1074561.html ) in donations which is an absurdly huge amount - [ the big parties only get around 400k a year in donations ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-12/parteispenden-fdp-spenden-sponsoring-parteien ) ( 2015 : cdu 600k , fdp 550k , spd 220k ) while getting ~ 30-40 % of voters , while a 10 % party gets ten times that amount in donations ? 
  afd claimed that several patriotic millionaires were to thank for this , but i am scepetical . 
  seriously , even in germany this was big news !, 
  i think / u/green _ noble might be trolling , how else could he just ignore this ? 
   russia may be economically waning , but it is still a major economy . 
  [ it does n't really look like one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vtb43tw.png ) . 
  all jokes aside , we should stop talking about what seperates us [ and instead focus on what unites us ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ) .

  well , you share a border with _ bavaria _ ... 
  shh , do n't disturb the whataboutism mating dance . 
  the national anti doping association of a country was convicted of cheating and running a doping programme with backing of the government . 
  thus , the integrity of the controlling institutions was compromised and all recent doping tests conducted by the forementioned institutions must be regarded as void . 
  russian athletes competing in the 2016 olympics therefore had less strict rules applied to them than athletes from other countries , giving the russian olympic teams an njust advantage . 
  according to the wada rules , a country convicted of running a government-operated doping program is to be punished by suspension from international tournaments . 
  the fatc that you are n't even acknowledgign the injsutice towards any other athlete blatantly shows your motifs . 
  a country was convicted of a state-operated , secret service assisted doping program involving several suspiscious deaths of key members . 
  _ state-operated _ . 
  _ secret service assisted _ . 
  _ suspiscious deaths of key members _ . 
  there is n't much up for debate anymore . 
  if it is state-operated , a ban for the entire country is necessary . 
  it is obvious that not only the russian track and field team was `` helped '' by state sponsored doping and secret service assisted cover up , but also every other branch of the russian olympic teams . 
  those other teams are just not prosecuted because there was n't a high ranking whistleblower for them yet and there probably wo n't be one , considering the deaths of several officials . 
  : everyone knows that the kleptocracy doped them all , but we pretend we do n't know . 
  also : russian athletes that can prove that they did n't participate in the state sponsored doping or were doped without their knowledge can still attend the olympics under neutral flag . 
  so the `` goodies '' wo n't be punished if they can prove their innocence . 
   but seriously i feel like death are quite a bit different from germany in mentality danes equal death , ** i knew it ** !, 
  ahhh , sweet , sweet auto correct ... 
   it sounds absolutely stupid . 
  no , it sounds about right - for what you would expect from a kleptocracy . 
  afaik the ban only applies to russia 's track and field team , not to all russian athletes . 
  sadly . 
  you share a border with germany after all . 
  efficiency is contagious . 
  or learn from history . 
  jk , we all know this wo n't happen, 
  [ yes , especially in africa , south asia and south america !,

  capitalism is the greatest destroyer of poverty in world history and socialism its greatest creator , rivaling war . 
  - garry kasparov, 
   let me just post a 27 second video eithout providing any context at all i bet my money on the fact that he is quoting someone . 
  * edit * : or a freudian slip - he probably intended to say `` other leaders on this planet '' . 
  which makes sense since he is talking on brexit matters . 
  of course . 
  not only i would , but i * am * . 
  also , russia barking very loudly while the western countries are n't barking at all transports a distorted image towards the uneducated `` normal '' people . 
  if you only hear `` aggression against russia '' , you start to believe it . 
  good . 
  god this is almost funny . 
  i imagine all these highly trained security service guys being proud while shitting on a carpet with a huge grin while thinking that this will make russia strong again . 
  really shows you how weak russia actually is if it needs to do stuff like this . 
  it 's incredible that we still call them `` russian backed rebels '' after all the evidence . 
  so much whataboutism and relativism here . 
  `` oh every government does that '' . 
  yeah , but not every government has the same leader/ruling party for 17 years , started several wars , broke up multiple countries , bombs the shit out of hospitals on a weekly basis , kills its opponents or white washes stalin . 
  hell no , not at all . 
  rt is foreign propaganda . 
  internal propaganda is distributed via all the state owned tv channels in russia like rossija 24 or channel 1 . 
  in the uk , rt 's quarterly audience is 2.5 million viewers , higher than anywhere else in the western countries . 
  it does not look like they have [ a veto in that matter ] ( http://www.eu-facts.org.uk/arguments-by-topic/can-the-uk-veto-new-eu-laws/ ) . 
  i do n't have the insight in that stuff , but i figure if high ranking eu politicians brought up the topic of changing legislature , then there will be a way . 
  not to mention that cameron for months ran around proclaiming that the uk would trigger article 50 ** the next day ** after the vote . 
  whoopsie , now people are demanding you hold your promise ? 
  sucks to be you ... 
  and by god , if there is one thing that can make the eu members agree on something really quickly , then it is monetary loss . 
  not to mention that the other eu members are fed up with the british politician games . 
  all the european stocks are down several percent , there is a huge uncertainty , nobody has any idea what conditions will apply in the next two years which makes trading or long term investment extremely risky . 
  this whole move costs the eu members a lot of money every day and i am convinced they wo n't take this dragging out any longer . 
  before there is a second referendum , the eu legislation will be changed to immediatly start with the article 50 negotations . 
  and i heavily doubt the eu will wait until october , as was camerons plan .
