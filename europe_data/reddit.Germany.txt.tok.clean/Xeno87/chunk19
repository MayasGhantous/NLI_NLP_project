  but surely , his kremlin propaganda channel rt , which is most viewed in the uk , had absolutely nothing to do with influencing the most uneducated voters . 
  i ca n't believe i even have to explain to you that you do n't joke about that . 
  `` it 's just a prank , bro '' - nope , not when you call to hang someone . 
  i would 've easily taken this as a joke if he had said `` junkers should be sacked '' , you know , monty python reference and all . 
  but he literally expressed to kill him . 
  i consider him senile now . 
  of course they are . 
  in the [ putin ideology bible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) , the brexit is one important step :  united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
  check out the stuff about ukraine and georgia and remember that this was written 20 years ago . 
  eerie . 
  what do you want ? 
  the [ official information hub ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/index_en.htm ) ? 
  the [ complete negotiation texts ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230 ) , even in a plain language version to accompany the official `` lawyer '' - language texts ? 
  their [ official twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fec.europa.eu%2ftrade%2fpolicy%2fin-focus%2fttip%2findex_en.htm&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;region=follow_link&amp;screen_name=eu_ttip_team&amp;tw_p=followbutton ) ? 
  i thought the eu would spend millions on unelected bureaucrats that watch exactly how i poop and regulate every single shit and is a dictatorship ruling everything . 
  and nowyou 're telling me people do n't notice it at all ? 
  now i 'm confused . 
  well i can in part understand it - the petition has nearly as many signatures as there was a voting difference between leave and remain , not to mention that the weather actually affected a few people that could not vote . 
  and such important decisions should require a 2/3 majority imo . 
  but then again , get 'em out already , i 'm sick of all that special treatment and constant abuse by the uk . 
   the uk wo n't be able to function inside eu . 
  they are going to be a lame duck eu member . 
  so everything stays the same ? 
  if you are a fan of the death sentence , you should consider leaving the european union . 
  after he stated that [ junckers should hang ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/johncleese/status/741752460524556288 ) i actually ca n't take him seriously anymore . 
  ... you really wan na see merkel doinking ? 
  woa woa woa - you are totally misunderstanding me here !, 
  what i tried to say here is that i genuinely think that people that oppose the eu would instantly change their minds and become huge eu supporters if the eu would _ behave _ nationalistic . 
  that a lot of people totally dig all that ( stupid ) pompous , `` feeling strong '' stuff . 
  i totally do n't , but i 'm convinced that _ if _ the eu would actually be a `` nationalistic '' , militaristic dictatorship , then those who oppose it the most today would be its most furious supporters . 
  well , i am deeply convinced that all those people calling the eu a dictatorship would become exuberant eu supporters if it would do stuff like military marches , flags everywhere , building monuments ... 
  but i do n't like useless stuff like that , i want the eu to be practical . 
  i 'd advocate that in every political debate on television , three to five educated supervisors are shadowing the debate and interrupt anytime someone makes a wrong claim or that can asked to check if something stated is correct or not . 
  would be an absolute shitfest in the beginning , but _ might _ end up raising the level of discussion . 
  the eu is already spending a shitload of money on that . 
  every document is available [ in ** every ** language ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm ) , it has toll-free telephone line ( 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11 ) to call them and ask any question , [ you can email ] ( http://europa.eu/contact/write-to-us/index_en.htm ) any question in your language , there are [ eu information direct centres througout europe . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/contact/meet-us/index_en.htm ) fuck , [ even their official portal for citizens ] ( http://europa.eu/index_en.htm ) is very nicely structured and contains an absurd amount of information . 
  visiting the eu parliament is free , [ even the guiding tours are ( if you registered before ) ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/visiting/en/homepage.html ) . 
  the eu is begging , no , actually throwing itself onto its citizens to give them information . 
  it is desperate to do so . 
  it 's not the eu that has to do something here , it 's the ignorant citizens . 
  thought it was an insult and had to google it . 
  now i have something in my eye . 
  well , it looks like they freed the scots and northern irish . 
  [ found this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/20i3mh/the_world_as_envisioned_by_russian_political/cg3wez2 ) . 
  might be an explanation , but then again i do n't even want to think about this crazy stuff for too long . 
   [ `` was wir jetzt nicht tun sollten , ist durch lautes ** s\u00e4belrasseln und kriegsgeheul ** die lage weiter anzuheizen ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/frank-walter-steinmeier-kritisiert-nato-manoever-in-osteuropa-a-1098360.html ) but what do i expect from a guy using the term `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' . 
  seeing your comment history , you must be really sad that you ca n't call it `` judenpresse '' anymore , are n't you ? 
  seeing that there are some more exercises with abbreviation `` sj '' like steadfast javelin or saber junction , i 'd think this name carries information about it . 
  some nato code probably . 
  is n't rt one of the most viewed `` news '' agencies in gb ? 
  talk about successfull propaganda . 
  ... i need a coffee . 
  disregard . 
  [ which sounds terribly familiar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) :  the book states that `` the maximum task [ of the future ] is the ` finlandization ' of all of europe ''  united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2016/06/17/russia-athletes-left-out-in-the-cold-as-olympic-ban-stands/  however , the council also made the surprise announcement that a `` tiny , tiny crack in the door '' remained open for russian athletes to compete under a neutral flag if they can prove they have not been tarnished by the state-sponsored doping regime exposed in the country . 
  much unfair , such ridiculing . 
  the athletes who worked as whistleblowers or can prove that they have not been tarnished by the state-sponsored doping regime can participate under neutral flag due to individual exception . 
  it 's also worth noting that the `` n/a '' exercises with more than 10.000 troops violate the ksze/osce/helsinki accords as well as the nato-russia basic agreement of 1997 . 
  they were not announced , even though exercises that size must be . 
  those 5.000 troops are a trip wire . 
  they are there so that an easy annexion with green men as seen on crimea ca n't happen - 5.000 well trained , well equipped soldiers are a force to be reckoned with . 
  does n't matter if they ca n't stand against the russian army , because that 's not their purpose . 
  hijacking top comment : if he thinks nato is warmongering then he should please [ explain wtf russia is doing then ] ( http://i.imgur.com/arzdows.jpg ), 
  well , we usually ca n't express our friendship very well while sleeping . 
  guys , erdogan has a life-long ban on participating in politics . 
  i doubt that a faked academic record will be _ that _ much of a deal when he even got around that . 
  i 'm pretty disappointed that the polish people fell so hard for pis and all their anti-german sentiments , i really thought better of the country of solidarno\u015b\u0107 . 
  feels good to read such an article for a change . 
   european union enlargement commissioner johannes hahn has congratulated serbian prime minister aleksandar vucic on his `` convincing '' victory that 's indeed a very weird and disconcerting statement . 
  i disagree with the uk goverment on everything currently , but not when it comes to russian sanctions . 
  go hard on them . 
  this smells like russia . 
  this blatant , obvious , smug way just smells like russia . 
  i have no idea about vucic , but if i googled him , would he talk favorably of putin , visit him , be complicit ? 
  i 'm living in frankfurt/main , and before i lived in langen/offenbach . 
  i see it , and it 's not a problem of islam , but poverty . 
  the 1951 convention still does n't apply . 
  what applies is the 1967 protocol and the us refugee law that closely resembles the geneva refugee convention , but differs from it in several points . 
  [ here is a quite extensive paper on that matter ] ( http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1154&amp;context=bjil ) . 
  one important part :  existing ina \u00a7 243 ( h ) differed from convention article 33 in being discretionary rather than mandatory , by not extending to all convention refugees , ' '' and by being unavailable to aliens who had not technically entered the united states . 
  19 moreover , administrative practice imposed a high burden of proof on would-be beneficiaries of ina \u00a7 243 ( h ) - a `` clear probability of persecution . ', 
  it does not . 
  that 's why there 's even a distinction between being party to one or both of them . 
  that 's why it 's distinctly called `` only '' . 
  no , _ only _ the 1967 protocol was signed . 
  [ in case you want to read it , it 's rather short . ], 
  ( http://www.ohchr.org/documents/professionalinterest/protocolrefugees.pdf ) the us is not subject to both , only the 67 protocol . 
   the us refugee processing system depends on exactly this being legal . 
  [ guess who did n't sign the 1951 geneva convention on refugees ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ), 
  yeah , totally , but everytime you call him that on bigger reddit subs , you get bombarded by comments that putin is n't fascist or that bait you into discussing and defining fascism and what not . 
  imagine how awesome europe and the eu would be without russia trying to fuck everything up . 
   fuck erdogan 's fascism . 
  it 's weird that there 's consensus about that here , but if you only dare to call putin fascist , a shitstorm buries you . 
  `` i do n't have any arguments '' .

   germany has not been very succesful integrating turks . 
  because ?
