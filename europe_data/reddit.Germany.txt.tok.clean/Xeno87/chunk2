  he 's a kid from post ww2 st. petersburg , [ he was a weak child ] ( http://imgur.com/4v5reau ) . 
  though he still had both his parents and did not live much worse than others , other kids picked at him , `` forced him on his knees '' as a humiliation . 
  he never got over that ( [ he renovated the house of his childhood and made sure the neighbouring houses were not ] ( http://imgur.com/ufbkpyk ) ) . 
  he joined the kgb , he wanted power . 
  i might also add that [ he is a pedophile ] ( http://imgur.com/j9hx1vd ) , he was transferred to another position when this came to his superiors ( this information led to [ litvinenkos death ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/22/alexander-litvinenko-slain-ex-kgb-spy-accused-puti/ ) ) . 
  when the wall came down , he , again , felt humiliated . 
  _ his _ once powerful country was now on its knees . 
  its former enemies sent his country pity packages , and he had to distribute them . 
  just like the humiliation in st. petersburg , he never got over this . 
  he found friends , he helped them raise to power [ with his kgb methods ] ( http://imgur.com/ns1tlju ) , later [ he helped himself to power ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_apartment_bombings ) . 
  he had friends thinking alike , alexandre duqin for example , who in [ 1997 already devised a plan to make russia great again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) . 
  this plan is even partially completed as of now actually . 
  putin is a weak , insecure man . 
  he knows this , he is small . 
  that 's why he stages all these pictures showing him as a strong man . 
  he is insanely insecure . 
  this is the basis of his anger , and the west has been his arch enemy for his entire life . 
  nobody can ever change this . 
  * edit * : there 's a multi-million , state run pr team making sure those small details about him drown in information . 
  there is a completely different putin that you would think , for example , fat putin during his time in east germany ( [ 1 ] ( http://imgur.com/lf8pxri ) , [ 2 ] ( http://imgur.com/etdkywe ) ) . 
   not even symbolic gestures were offered * you mean like during the 90 's , when western countries sent care packages to russia ( which btw putin was in charge of distributing ) ? 
  * or when nasa and esa bought several russian segments of a cancelled space station to build the iss , made it orbit at the inclination of baikonur so the russians can launch there easier , paid for all russian rocket launches to iss and even have them the commando over the most important parts ? 
  * or when during the beslan shootings or the theatre hostage situation , western countries repeatedly backed russia against chechnyian , got ta say it , freedom fighters ? 
  * or when schr\u00f6der made germany and europe completely dependend on russian gas , on the expense of western companies ? 
  * or when thousands of western companies started business in russia ? 
  * or when we included russia in the g8 , even though its economy was a laughing joke ? 
  * or when during the nato summit in 2006 , nato countries germany , france and uk vetoed the ukrainian and georgian application ** out of respect to russian concerns ** , after putin himself threatened to annex parts of these countries like crimea ? 
  yeah , we totally treated them like shit . 
  til . 
  no , do n't . 
  apparently , russian pilots are too bad to navigate . 
  if you shoot them down , then by the simple laws of evolution , you will make the russian airforce better . 
   profiting off russia means putin is controlling it all ok . 
  seeing the severity with which putin wants to ensure the safety of russians in other countries , yes , he is . 
  you need soundproof walls so nobody hears the altar boy cry . 
  to be fair , you would expect a mob boss running a country to be able to launder the money through allies . 
  let 's check hargreaves :  hargreavess thinks that those worries are massively overblown , citing the fact that russians and citizens from all over the world pump money into the city . 
   [ `` we raise money for the russians , we raise money all over the world , for countries that are not in europe . 
  they 've got to use london . 
  london can raise billions on a few phone calls , '' he said . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/hargreaves-lansdown-founder-peter-hargreaves-backs-brexit-2016-3?r=uk&amp;ir=t ) he sure likes dem russian monies apparently . 
  * edit * : [ well and banks has even more obvious russian ties ] ( http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/07/26/who-funded-brexit/ ) you know , the worst thing is when you check for putin under your bed and then you find him . 
  i feel like i should know this , but is there a `` backup '' of the jwst in case of launch failure ? 
  i think i heard the very same being said about germany once ... 
  for example when in 2010 his party restricted the rights of the constitutional court in budget topics , after one of his laws was ruled unconstitutional . 
  [ not to mention that there was a surge in job creation for construction , security , teaching , management and social services . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/fluechtlinge-zuzug-schafft-zehntausende-neue-jobs-in-deutschland-a-1089100.html ) i have zero doubt of the huge economic profit refugees are creating , especially since it was the same during the yugoslavia crisis . 
   if nobody is giving them information to leak they have nothing to publish , that 's not their fault [ lol ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/558qkn/russia_cheerful_propaganda_and_hate_on_command/d88q27n ), 
  so , did they show proof of this ? 
  because simply the word of the hungarian government is not trustworthy in this matter . 
   article 50 will be triggered the day after the vote  ... the end of the week  ... the end of the month  ... in three months  ... end of the year  ... not before 2017  ... spring 2017 yeah ... i call bullshit . 
  the problem with ceta are people who refuse to properly inform themselves before making a decision . 
  do n't see why you are downvoted , because you 're right . 
  this was [ back in 2010 ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2010/1026/wikileaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-russia.-but-will-russians-get-to-read-about-it ) , two years before he fled to the ecuadorian embassy . 
  though my memory might have played a trick on me and that it was n't him flying over , but israel shamir instead . 
  not a lie . 
  if it was , then you would have no problem showing us major leaks from wikileaks on russia and putin , which you have n't . 
  even the opposite , i can show [ that wikileaks had something on russia ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2010/1026/wikileaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-russia.-but-will-russians-get-to-read-about-it ) , and [ after a threat from russia ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2028283,00.html ) , it never released them [ and instead sold them to lukashenko instead ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/31/wikileaks-holocaust-denier-handled-moscow-cables ) . 
  so , while you ca n't prove anything at all , i can prove my story . 
  which makes you the liar . 
  [ here , for example ] ( http://m.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2010/1026/wikileaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-russia.-but-will-russians-get-to-read-about-it ) , or [ here ] ( http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2028283,00.html ) . 
  though i have to admit it is really , really difficult to find it again when searching for it in 2016 . 
  i will update this post when i find more sources . 
  i 'm not / u/savannajeff , and his statement still is mostly valid - there are no real leaks about russia through wikileaks . 
  he used a hyperbole here , but it is kinda justified . 
  remember when assange anounced that he had a huge leak on putin incoming , visited russia , forgot the leak and suddenly had a show on rt ? 
  i know . 
  i just wanted to give him the possibility to back up his claims about and defense of wikileaks , especially since his profile looks ~ ~ suspicious ~ ~ a tad biased . 
  mind giving us a little insight on a few , ** big ** leaks about putin/people close to putin that are on wikileaks ? 
  because all i can find using the wikileaks search engine is basically non-stuff . 
  * edit * : for example , i only find stuff like `` putin still holding the reins for 2012 election '' , `` g3 - russia - russia 's putin deflects calls for election rerun '' , `` putin was ready to put nuclear weapons on alert in crimea crisis '' . 
  basically only referencing putin or talking about long known stuff . 
  but damn it , they can clean it at least . 
  oh , this is a good question . 
  i would opt for `` make mexico great again '' . 
  oh god i ca n't stop making it appear and disappear again . 
  guys , seriously , if trump gets elected we should switch mexico with russia . 
  the us gets rid of mexico while trump gets his buddy putin , and we have a nice friendship party over here . 
  and you are totally justified being so . 
  [ right wing extremist attacks have doubled compared to last year ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlinge-rechte-gewalt-gegen-auslaender-nimmt-zu-a-1113669.html ), 
  do you still remember what a carricature is ? 
   a caricature is a rendered image showing the features of its subject in a simplified or ** exaggerated ** way through sketching , pencil strokes or through other artistic drawings . 
   yeah . 
  nato . 
  surprise . 
  putin 's wunderwaffe against nato will debate hillary clinton today . 
   i do not know how to solve eastern ukraine nor crimea . 
  [ i think i do . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/rggw9hb ) ( the caption reads `` end of the syrian conflict '' ), 
  yeah sure , an agreement that was 5 fucking years in negotiations alone and is n't even passed after 2 more will suddenly pop up within 24 months . 
  wtf . 
  this stuff does n't `` pop up '' , it 's just you not caring at all until some blog tells you to reject it . 
   third dimension ... how does it work ??? 
  i guess saying that the military jet flown few kilometres away from passenger would n't give a proper `` evil russians '' vibe ... a 747 travels at 900 km/h . 
  at this speed , 1.8 km distance is very , very short and does leave no room for mistakes . 
   one of those statements has to be false . 
  it means that all [ secondary surveillance radar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secondary_surveillance_radar ) measures were disabled . 
  norwegian and icelandic airspaces are quite a far apart . 
  so they probably mean the airspace monitored by icelandic air traffic controllers norwegian airspace and norwegian monitored airspace are used synonymously, 
  but how are they supposed to reach a fair deal when everyone cries about the agreement before negotiations are even finished ?
