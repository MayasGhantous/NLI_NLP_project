  i have heard this all my life , we did n't integrate the turks , the greek , the italians , the russians ... 
  so how do you measure that ? 
  and those people here were n't refugees , they were welcomed workers who were invited and came here completely legally . 
  protect itself from _ what _ exactly ? 
  because i can see pretty well where you are going with that . 
  so , i 'm wondering , why is germany the strongest nation in europe currently ? 
  because apparently it should n't be , [ it took in most of the refugees in the last refgee crisis ] ( https://www.total-croatia-news.com/media/k2/items/cache/f8f336d27957a1b2f13b2daec1d1b4b0_xl.jpg ) 20 years ago and is still standing strong , and even stronger than other countries in europe . 
  why did n't it have to protect itself back then ? 
  because the refugees were n't black or muslim ? 
  i guess this is where you want to go , right ? 
  and i 'm glad that you do n't decide who to let in , but educated and trained people who can find out if someone 's from a war zone or not . 
  * edit * : also , how do you actually want to do that ? 
  build a wall around your country like north korea or east germany ? 
   they arent refugees until their applications are processed that 's not true . 
  the geneva convention goes a long way to define refugees . 
  that 's pretty short sighted when talking about refugees . 
  have you tried fleeing from war ? 
  how big do you think is the chance of you losing your papers or your papers becoming void because you were living on rebel territory ? 
  also , this is settled in the geneva convention : ** the contracting states shall ** * provide identity papers for refugees ( article 27 ) * provide travel documents for refugees ( article 28 ) ** the contracting states shall not ** * impose penalties on refugees who entered illegally in search of asylum if they present themselves ( article 31 ) * forcibly return or `` refoul '' refugees to the country they 've fled from ( article 33 ) . 
   i 'm sure people here like / u/xeno87 would agree that radicalised asylum seekers should be sent home . 
  i do , if they committed crimes they should also be punished _ here _ before we send them home . 
  but i also think that we should focus more on preventing them of getting radicalized - which sadly is quite an undertaking . 
   by the end of 2015 , the middle east was home to about ** 23 million displaced migrants ** -- or about four-in-ten of all displaced people worldwide . 
  you really should stop mixing displaced people with migrants :  in addition to displaced persons , a substantial portion of the middle east 's surging migrant population is made up of manual laborers and professionals relocating to the oil-rich countries of the persian gulf from other countries , many in pursuit of economic opportunity . 
   between 2005 and 2015 , the number of ** non-displaced , international migrants ** in the middle east increased from roughly 19 million to about 31 million . 
  migrants \u2260 displaced ~ ~ people ~ ~ migrants, 
   there are upwards of 50m people displaced in me alone . 
   if anything you are the one without a clue here . 
  [ no there are n't you stupid prick . 
  ] ( http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/overview ) ca n't you count ? 
  oh no , wait , you are making shit up because you do n't know anything . 
  start living in a wooden barrack without actually having rights for a whole year . 
  * edit * : oh and flee from a war zone some day . 
  might give you perspective different than what you are seeing from your basement . 
   always extremes , never any balance or middle ground . 
  treating people like people is extreme . 
  yeah , because treating refugees like people is only ok if it 's white people right ? 
  the geneva convention was made after the worst refugee crisis in history . 
  ever . 
  it was made by people who experienced war first hand , not from their cozy chair in mom 's basement . 
  those guys knew what they were talking about , and there is no reason that `` treat people like people '' is to be abandoned . 
  if you do n't like that , go live in russia or north korea . 
  good , so nothing changed for refugees that arrive here by foot , car or boat mostly . 
  damn , 60 year old treaty and still manages to be adequate for today 's problems . 
   inadequate to deal with modern realities , international travel and technology . 
  lol , `` there were n't airplanes in 1951 '' . 
   fuck off with your geneva convention bullshit piss off to russia or north korea then . 
  yeah and it was written by people whp experienced war first hand and were not spoiled little sissy 's that only know peace and prosperity . 
  i trust them more than any armchair general on reddit . 
   the geneva convection is only applicable to people who have been accepted as refugees . 
  and we 're talking just about those people , see / u/compressedmatter 's comment :  refugees have no right to walk around freely in the territory they arrive in before their application is processed . 
  he 's talking about refugees , i 'm talking about refugees , you are deflecting . 
  he 's not . 
  paying security to keep people _ in _ is something different form what is done currently . 
   refugees have no right ever heard of something called the constitution ? 
  or [ the fucking geneva convention ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) #refugees shall be treated at least like other non-nationals in relation to * ** the right to free movement and free choice of residence within the country ( article 26 ) ** * movable and immovable property ( article 13 ) * wage-earning employment ( article 17 ) * self-employment ( article 18 ) * housing ( article 21 ) # the contracting states shall * respect a refugee 's personal status and the rights that come with it , particularly rights related to marriage ( article 12 ) * provide the possibility of assimilation and naturalization to refugees ( article 34 ) #the contracting states shall ** not ** * discriminate against refugees ( article 3 ) #refugees shall be treated at least like nationals in relation to * freedom to practice their religion ( article 4 ) * the respect and protection of artistic rights and industrial property ( article 14 ) * rationing ( article 20 ) * elementary education ( article 22 ) * public relief and assistance ( article 23 ) * labour legislation and social security ( article 24 )  we already pay for housing , security oh , do you ? 
  so you are paying for security and housing intended to keep people _ in _ ? 
  really ? 
  i see you have never worked with people before . 
   housing them in purpose built camps i guess wooden , without sanitation or heating , right ? 
  because containers that are built for this purpose are n't enough already ? 
  feel free to pay for housing , security staff to enforce this and the legal costs for lawyers and legal fees for all those lawsuits about violations of constitutional rights and geneva conventions . 
  * edit * : downvotes ? 
  let 's teach you dipshits a bit about [ the fucking geneva convention  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) #refugees shall be treated at least like other non-nationals in relation to * ** the right to free movement and free choice of residence within the country ( article 26 ) ** * ** housing ( article 21 ) ** * movable and immovable property ( article 13 ) * wage-earning employment ( article 17 ) * self-employment ( article 18 ) # the contracting states shall * respect a refugee 's personal status and the rights that come with it , particularly rights related to marriage ( article 12 ) * provide the possibility of assimilation and naturalization to refugees ( article 34 ) #the contracting states shall ** not ** * discriminate against refugees ( article 3 ) #refugees shall be treated at least like nationals in relation to * freedom to practice their religion ( article 4 ) * the respect and protection of artistic rights and industrial property ( article 14 ) * rationing ( article 20 ) * elementary education ( article 22 ) * public relief and assistance ( article 23 ) * labour legislation and social security ( article 24 ), 
  find out how a deportation works and you can probably answer that question yourself . 
  sounds like a huge density of shitheads around you . 
  with that standard , there are no americans except for those few in native american reservations, 
  / u/oneofthepurebloods `` only white people are european '' . 
  goddammit i miss the time when you shitheads could n't even get out of the daylight . 
  * edit * : in case there are people about to become shitheads : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afro-germans one example of non-white europeans . 
  because there are people paying huge sums to promote hate towards the eu . 
  meanwhile , nobody does the reverse . 
   breivik was a mass-shooter found the white supremacist . 
  [ he was convicted for terrorism ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/anders_behring_breivik ) . 
  you are so painfully obvious , terrorism for you is everything brown people so . 
  organisation is not terrorism . 
  breivik is a terrorist , too , but he was not part of any organisation . 
  and killing dark skinned people is intent . 
  that is terrorism , you know . 
  islamists have one main argument : the west hates us . 
  they are the enemy . 
  you must fight them . 
  it 's us against them . 
  if countries like germany or sweden do n't act like this and instead take in the poor and persecuted , they are losing their narrative . 
  they ca n't afford that , they need hate , not humanity . 
  yeah , i 'm sure you know it all . 
  as i said , if you have any information , give it to the police , otherwise shut up and let professionals handle this . 
  you are neither qualified nor capable . 
  because the culprit was brown , right ? 
  yeah , swedish government does not classify terrorism like this . 
  weird , russia had a terrorist attack recently and they do n't have `` mass immigration '' . 
  they are classified by swedish authorities as terrorist attacks . 
  alas , i know now that _ you _ classify terrorism different : it 's terrorism if a brown guy did it , right ? 
  if you have more information than the swedish police , then give it to them . 
  otherwise shut the fuck up . 
  we know islamic terrorism exists , we 're not twelve you know . 
  probably not because stockholm is not a sister city of berlin . 
  that the same shitheads that are either almost joyful that there was `` finally '' an attack in sweden or are smug and saying `` we told you so '' were in the russian thread and pretended to be emphasizing . 
  since there were comments ( now deleted ) about `` first terrorist attack in sweden '' or `` now it has finally happened '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009\u201310_malm\u00f6_shootings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trollh\u00e4ttan_school_attack and those are just the recent ones .
