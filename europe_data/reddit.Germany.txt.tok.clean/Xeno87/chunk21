  wake up and think that terrorism sucks ? 
  well you 're a bit late for that . 
  and now pay attention how this thread is evolving and compare it to the thread about the terrorist attack in st. petersburg . 
  yeah , i know . 
  not only.my government , but my party ( schr\u00f6ders party spd ) ist directly complicit in this . 
  but not all of us . 
   this pipeline is only viable if the eu pays money for it i 'm all for it as long as russia and turkey do n't control a shit . 
  it 's a trade i 'd call worth . 
  oh my god you are not joking . 
  22.7 % in 2015 , and at its peak in march 2013 , it was 26.3 % . 
  it 's down almost 10 % in 4 years !, 
  quite true . 
  makes it even stranger that the current chief minister of gibraltar resorts to such language . 
  i 'm not an engineer or material scientist , but [ apparently saltwater is incredibly problematic for concrete ] ( http://www.networx.com/article/what-salt-water-does-to-houses ) . 
   saltwater does n't stop there . 
  it has infamously corrosive effects on concrete , including foundations , pilings , sidewalks , and structural walls . 
  in addition to eating into the metal reinforcements used inside concrete architecture , it can penetrate concrete and slowly break it down , leading to weakness and instability that may emerge years later . 
  not to mention that the eurotunnel lies 40m below the surface , which means 4 bar of pressure , and is 50 kilometres long . 
  i 'm sure engineers would get a heart attack if you wanted to dewater that . 
  a flooded tunnel will basically never be safe again . 
  it would be easier to build a new one instead of fixing the old one . 
  and slovenia is one of the european countries with lowest levels of discrimination against women in social institutions . 
  looks like that `` well paid job '' is also `` well fulfilled '', 
  the numbers of mediterranean countries give me a heart attack , but i 'm convinced that the better the rest of the eu works , the more they will profit from it . 
  still , we need to actively find solutions to support those countries . 
  he was asked a hypothetical question , and instead of answering carefully like a statesmen and diplomat he went on to ramble . 
  diplomacy exists for a reason , if you do n't chose your words carefully , you get yourself into deep shit . 
  yeah , that 's kinda a problem . 
  see , i 'm _ really _ into space and physics ( and studying and working to do this as a job ) . 
  of course , i have absolutely no problem with star wars - i know which things work , i know which things are bogus , but i can ignore that and enjoy the movie . 
  but as soon as a movie or series try to be somewhat accurate , not playing in another galaxy , or the very far future , i ca n't do that anymore . 
  if the movie makes a point in being somewhat credible , i find it very had to suspend my disbelief ( i like that term ) . 
  i ca n't enjoy gravity for example with its immense amount of errors because it aims to take place right here , basically right now , with things i know and am very familiar with . 
  but i can enjoy star trek or star wars , because it 's so , so far from `` today '' . 
  and of course , the best thing are movies like 2001 - those who just do everythign right in the first place . 
  justified fears . 
  it 's incredible how a country in europe after ww2 can be so hungry for clay like russia . 
  apparently , it did n't learn its lesson . 
  yeah , and leviticus also states :  you shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together . 
   you shall not wear a material mixed of wool and linen together . 
   you shall make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garment with which you cover yourself it 's arbitrary , thousands of years old stuff that should only have sentimental value today . 
   they have a hard-on for the traditional family . 
  ah yes , the good old times when franz josef strau\u00df hooked up with a 17 year old school girl and cheated on his wife . 
  wonderful traditional family . 
  i guess that 's why seehofer has a hard on for trump with his 3 ... 4 ... ? 
  mail order brides and his daughter . 
  god i just hope they got themselves an advisor to take care of orbital mechanics and other things to make them somewhat scientifically correct . 
   we 've seen time and again that the eu and local governments are unable to keep up with the flow of migrants entering europe . 
  what ? 
  before 2014 we were pretty damn good at that , only the syrian refugee crisis posed a problem . 
  and even now , we 're damn good at that :  last year 179,000 of the 181,000 african refugees in italy were picked up outside libyan coastal waters either by the italian navy , the eu border agency frontex or by ngos . 
  that 's a pretty good percentage , 98.89 % of illegal border crossings were immediatly swept up . 
   more importantly , you still have n't addressed the fact that the million person figure is n't bullshit . 
  walker-cousins says :  `` my informants in the area tell me there are potentially one million migrants , if not more , already coming up through the pipeline from central africa and the horn of africa . '' he 's talking about an ** immediate ** number . 
  that means he assumes this number to mgirate in _ less _ than a year . 
  i know from recent history that this number is just bollocks . 
  why do n't you ask walker-cousins why he does not prove his numbers ? 
  he only talks about some `` informants '' , while i can give actual numbers for the last years . 
   but there 's definitely a million coming over a fairly small period of time in the immediate future yeah , if we wait long enough there will be 100 million russians coming into your country . 
  * edit * : also , another reason to call bullshit : a million people is a number you can actually _ see _ . 
  * if * there was a million people in africa on the move to europe , every camp , every city would see this huge flux of people . 
  they ca n't just sneak through that continent , so many people must eat , sleep , work , move . 
  you could see the migrant routes through the middle east , the balkans , eats africa . 
  now why does not a single camp on the west africa route report a sudden and huge number of people passing through ? 
  because there are n't . 
  a lower number means it 's easier to manage , easier to prevent , easiert so solve ? 
  if you 're a night guard for a mansion , would you rather have 1 intruder per night for 1 month or 30 intruders in one night ? 
  get real and actually study what is happening instead of fantasizing about it . 
  oh , yeah , i can totally agree on that !, 
  they libyan war began in 2011 and we barely see a bump there . 
  and even if the new fightings from 2014 had an influence - only 150.000 people through the africa route . 
  that 's not a million . 
  i 'm pretty sure the 2016 data will show a drastic decline , and by early 2018 we will be on a level of 2009 again . 
   the reality is that 1 million migrants is not an exaggeration , it is simply a beginning . 
  it _ is _ exaggeration , and it _ is _ bullshit : [ here are the numbers for illegal crossings of the eu borders from '09 to ' 15 . 
  ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/03/ft_16.03.15_migrantroutes_annually.png ) the sharp increase of ' 14 - '15 can be directly attributed to the syrian war , wheareas 1m african migrants is just far fatched to the max :  [ the eastern mediterranean sea route from turkey to greece ( largely taken by syrian , afghan and iraqi migrants ) totaled nearly 900,000 detections in 2015 ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/18/illegal-migration-to-eu-rises-for-routes-both-well-worn-and-less-traveled/ ) . 
  the western africa route , even though the numbers tripled , only accounted for 150,000 illegal border crossings each year . 
  so if someone wants to explain to me that there are 1m africans on their way , i want him to show them to me first . 
  but not from africa .

  yeah and three billion $ may be transferred to my bank account any moment now . 
  fixed as of now . 
  did n't even realize it was one pixel too far up . 
  let 's see if we can move it, 
  pretty sure fucking your cousin is in the bible , but if you fuck your cousin then it 's not because you do it in jesus ' honor . 
  also lol you are hilarious, 
  have fun proving that `` the muslims '' on trumps list are . 
  who cares , that 's not the point . 
  trumps list does n't focus on that , adolf 's did n't either . 
  well i was n't around back then , but apparently `` jewish crime '' and `` jewish extremism '' was bad enough that [ adolf hitlers government published lists of crimes committed by jews , immigrants or other minorities ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/02/adolf-hitler-also-published-a-list-of-crimes-committed-by-groups-he-didnt-like/ ) . 
  ( [ which coincidentally , trump wants to do , too . 
  ] ( https://www.indy100.com/article/trump-weekly-list-immigrants-crimes-hitler-comparisons-7547211 ) ) well , looks like those situations are damn comparable in terms of crime . 
  so , maybe the absence of tv-friendly terrorist attacks was because of the lack of tv and internet , but apparently to trump , any other crime seems bad enough . 
  lol , it 's fucking funny how you desperately try to pretend that someone saying fascist things is not a fascist . 
  you ca n't even find instances of him clearly saying anti fascist things , so fascist is he . 
  are you projecting and are actually 12 yourselves ? 
  trump says things only fascists says and never distanced himself from it ?
