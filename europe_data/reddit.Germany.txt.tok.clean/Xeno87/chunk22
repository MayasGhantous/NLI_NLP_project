  great , still in the fascist corner !, 
  so , trump did nothing to get rid of the claim of being a fascist after those two comments ? 
  he did n't visit a mosque , or heavily condemned attacks on muslims or asked for forgiveness for saying things only fascists do ? 
  great , he 's still in the fascist corner . 
  i do n't care about that , show me what very convincing stuff trump has done to shake those two comments off . 
  well , ok : if someone wants to [ discriminate an entire religion ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-the-united-states/ ) ( muslim ban ) and [ calls for special identification for a religious group ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-has-big-plans-1303117537878070.html ) , that instantly places him into the fascist corner and he must do very , _ very _ convincing things to get out of that . 
  because those two things are only done by fascists . 
  so unless you have trump marching at an antifa march , there is not much he can do to get rid of that . 
  i 'm not some `` love is in the air '' - hippie like you that gives people the benefit of doubt , i expect them to be little shits first and they must convince me otherwise . 
  explain how he , his campaign and his methods differ from fascists . 
  that 's easier . 
  i mean , if someone is _ not _ a fascist , he ** frequently ** does stuff fascist people do n't do . 
  also , it will show pretty good what you think characterizes fascist movements and if it is enough . 
  exactly . 
  but those who actually used violence still were a minority in the party itself , and i do n't know of any incidents where adolf himself beat someone up . 
  that 's why i wrote _ most people in his party _ . 
  it does n't need you to beat up immigrants to be a fascist . 
  trump is a fascist , and just because he is only in office for 70 days and did n't murder millions of people _ yet _ does n't make him anything less of a fascist . 
  stop telling me that hitler was n't a fascist before ww2 . 
  * edit * : also i 'm quite astounded that you think everything else adolf or any other fascist leader and trump do have in common can be disregarded . 
  i would think normal people would like someone to be as less fascist as possible instead of `` just '' not killing someone . 
   but unlike trump these are actual fascists who go out , beat up immigrants and occasionally attack opposition . 
  adolf never did that . 
  most people in his party never did before the war . 
  do n't downplay trump , he deserves to be called fascist . 
  * edit * : 1930 there were 7700 people in the sa , and 389,000 in the nsdap . 
  the vast majority of nazi party members never beat up anyone , just like adolf himself . 
  * edit * : so , just to give you guys a head start : if someone wants to [ discriminate an entire religion ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-the-united-states/ ) ( muslim ban ) and [ calls for special identification for a religious group ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-has-big-plans-1303117537878070.html ) , that instantly places him into the fascist corner and he must do very , _ very _ convincing things to get out of that . 
  because those two things are only done by fascists . 
   the best deal the eu can get for itself is unconditional full access to the single market well , sure , and that is directly correlated to the entire rest like free movement and stuff . 
  this is would be just adhering to the rules . 
  i 'm amazed how much i am undestanding . 
  it 's a bit like reading late night text messages from drunk german buddies . 
  oh my god this is golden . 
  comedy central uk really outdid themselves . 
  what exactly do you think makes this comic disrespectful ? 
  because to me it is _ far _ from that . 
  bruce mackinnon 's cartoons often are left handed . 
  [ see here for example ] ( http://thechronicleherald.ca/sites/default/files/u23/bruce7.jpg ) , [ or here ] ( http://assets.nationalnewswatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mac2492-770x653.jpg ) , [ or here ] ( http://assets.nationalnewswatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mac2560-770x595.jpg ), 
  and you have never considered the possibility of the uk being treated like any other country in the world by the eu , getting hit hard by brexit and finally.coming to the conclusion that all this was stupid as fuck and eventually reapplying , but this time without a rebate or other fancy snowflake shit ? 
  if the eu gives the uk another special status , it will never reapply . 
  the harder the economic consequences on the uk , the sooner they will realize how stupid this move was and try to undo it . 
   just negotiate reasonably and negotiate a fair deal . 
  and wanting the best possible outcome for the eu is fair . 
   the eu failed here . 
  i do n't agree on this . 
   did n't the eu lose something like 16 % of its economic power due to gb leaving ? 
  all while the uk loses access to ( one of ) the biggest single market in the world , made up by all neighbouring countries . 
  you can tell that one of both is significantly worse off . 
   in the meantime let 's focus on our own problems you mean like negotiating brexit ? 
  that 's going to be one of the biggest problems on the list for two years . 
  i disagree , the eu should go the hardest it can on the uk . 
  those insane people that accused the eu of being a literal spawn of hell during the leave campaign will accuse the eu of punishing the uk nevertheless . 
  so if the eu gets blamed no matter what , i want it to get the best deal _ for itself _ it can get . 
   it 's amusing to see those who celebrate so much their primary role in defeating fascism do n't forget their key role in enabling fascism . 
  circumventing the versaille treaty , make the league of nations look like a fool , dividing poland and eastern europe ... 
  lol , you are so out of arguments that you are equaling military invasion with immigration . 
  lol you are so desperate . 
  that 's not what those guys 200 years ago said . 
  weird . 
  everytime in history , when someone said this , it turned out to be wrong . 
  now you are saying it ... and i doubt anything is different just because you are saying it . 
  because you say so ? 
  if this was today : #it 's a femnist conspiracy !!!, 
  the un wants to replace all men in europe and rarbababbababababrbaba !!!, 
  only putin and trump can save us !, 
  yeah , because russia is ranked 148th out of 179 countries in the press freedom index . 
  he should be the one arrested , and then tried in den haag . 
  well 10 years of eu money are quite a help . 
  yeah , that 's the same those guys 200 years ago said when they were told that 200 years ago others cried because of foreigners coming . 
  it 's funny when you write down the arguments and see how they had to get broader and broader over the decades to still fit the same narrative . 
   i have just written a set of difference yes , so have those guys 200 years ago , and they were wrong . 
  just like you are today . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  i wrote that at least 40 times in 2014 , and i will continue to write it everytime i see someone claiming that crimea had a valid referendum . 
  maybe i should update it with links , for example to the ballot paper etc. 
   are you really stupid enough to compare the migration of the irish to america to the migration of middle easterners , south asians and africans to europe ? 
  yes , because there is no difference . 
  lol . 
  you do n't know the requirements for a democratic referendum ? 
  let me help you with a few basic ones : * options : the options given in a referendum about secession must be at least : status quo ( stay at homeland ) , become independent , join another country . 
  the crimean referendum offered only two options , but no option for status quo . 
  the biggest fuckup , this renders the entire referendum invalid . 
  * enough time for preparation . 
  decision making needs time , so does electioneering or raising funds . 
  if you hold a referendum quickly , you reward the side that has more money or was prepared because of forehand knowledge ( russia ... ) . 
  the crimean referendum was broguht forward ** twice ** and held after just two weeks . 
  a real referendum has at least several months of time . 
  * a secret ballot : that 's a given - almost every important political referendum should be secret , ** especially when conducted under presence of oreign military ** . 
  the crimean referendum was conducted using see-through ballot boxes ** and without using envelopes ** . 
  it was therefore possible to identify voters who voted against it . 
  also , there were movable ballots - a no-go . 
  * independent election observers : only russian-affiliated politicans from other countries were present , actual election observers like from the osce were denied access . 
  if only one of those things is not a given , a referendum is invalid . 
  the crimean referendum did n't even match one of it . 
  they do !, 
  but there was no referendum that fulfilled the requirements for a valid , democratic election . 
  so , until there is one that meets the requirements , crimeans did not have the chance for self determination . 
  tell me the last time a western country used armed forces to extend its broders ? 
   germans : 40,000 3.93 % germany should take military action to protect the german minority .
