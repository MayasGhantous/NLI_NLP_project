  [ `` how countries join nato '' vs `` how countries join russia '' ] ( http://imgur.com/aeqp0ji ), 
   i do n't think asking for the outcome to be reversed is the best way to show your opposition to it . 
  but is n't this exactly what the anti-eu front in britain has been doing ever since ? 
   the decision to allow african and middle-eastern immigration from non-european countries into european countries on the basis that `` they will integrate after one or two generation maximum do n't worry about it '' had profund destabilizing consequences on our societies . 
  borders exist for a good reason . 
  i 'm damn sure i read exactly the same against irish immigration to the us . 
  * edit * : i knew this tone sounded familiar : * lyman beecher , leader of the second great awakening , on english immigrants , 1834 : _ what means the paying of the passage and emptying out upon our shores such floods of pauper emigrants -- the contents of the poor house and the sweepings of the streets ? 
  -- multiplying tumults and violence , filling our prisons , and crowding our poor-houses , and quadrupling our taxation , and sending annually accumulating thousands to the poll to lay their inexperienced hand upon the helm of our power ? _ * john dos passos , early 20th century novelist , on u.s. immigration policy : _ the people of this country are too tolerant . 
  there 's no other country in the world where they 'd allow it ... after all we built up this country and then we allow a lot of foreigners , the scum of europe , the offscourings of polish ghettos to come and run it for us . _ * during a congressional hearing , 1920 : _ they are coming in such numbers and we are unable adequately to take care of them ... it simply amounts to unrestricted and indiscriminate dumping into this country of people of every character and description ... if there were in existence a ship that could hold three million human beings , then three million jews of poland would board to escape to america . _ * representative grant hudson , 1924 : _ now , what do we find in all our large cities ? 
  entire sections containing a population incapable of understanding our institutions , with no comprehension of our national ideals , and for the most part incapable of speaking the english language . 
  foreign language information service gives evidence that many southern europeans resent as an unjust discrimination the quota laws and represent america as showing race hatred and unmindful of its mission to the world . 
  the reverse is true . 
  america 's first duty is to those already within her own shores . _ the same shit since 200 years . 
  does n't it get boring some day ? 
  * edit2 : * damn , this one is the best : * john jay , first chief justice of supreme court , regarding `` catholic alien invaders , '' 1750s : ** _ we should build a wall of brass around the country . _ **, 
   kfw said an experienced programmer made an input error that caused its software to automatically make multiple payments to the four banks . 
  if an inexperienced programmer could wipe my student debt , that 'd be great . 
  ( kfw manages the federal student loan `` baf\u00f6g '' ) . 
  this . 
  and on top of that , those countries now are independent and democratic ( albeit troubled in some cases ) . 
  compare that to anything russia did . 
  she should run in russia with that agenda . 
  does n't this have some justification in this context ? 
  it could help making comparisons to other wine regions regarding climate for example . 
  even though i know where germany is located , i would probably be plain wrong about comparing its latitude to other ( easter - ) european countries without a map . 
  good . 
  i hope that especially the troubled countries profit from this the most ( although i doubt it ) . 
   julian assange ah yes , that guy with the show on rt. 
  of course he 's more credible than the parents . 
  funfact : those dead russian dissidents ? 
  their family members accuse putin of killing them . 
   they have not been prosecuted and the allegations have not been tested in a criminal court how is this legal ? 
  you are using the word `` lie '' too quickly . 
  holy fuck . 
  i long for the day we can artificially grow meat in industrial margins to stop that shit ( and still get our steak ) . 
  [ according to reuters , he is . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tillerson-nato-iduskbn16v1t0 ) note that this news is barely an hour old . 
  but the article briefly mentions that :  ukrainian president petro poroshenko called the shooting in kiev of denis voronenkov , a former russian communist party member who began sharply criticizing putin after fleeing russia in 2016 , an `` act of state terrorism by russia . '', 
  it explicitly states that he only recently started criticizing putin . 
   [ the slain man 's parents , mary and joel rich of omaha , nebraska , are distressed by the apparent political exploitation of their son 's death by clinton 's opponents . 
  seth rich had just accepted a promotion from the dnc to a position in her campaign , they say , and he was devoted to getting her elected . 
  `` it 's unfortunate and hurtful , '' his parents say , in a statement to newsweek , `` that at the moment a murderer remains at large , there remains unfounded press speculation about the activities of our son that night . 
  we should be focusing on the perpetrator at large . '' ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/seth-rich-murder-dnc-hack-julian-assange-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-492084 ) even his family members say that this is bullshit . 
  go eat some pizza , t_d drone . 
  / ru/roma _ veictrix said he is visiting russia and putin ** first ** . 
  that 's no lie , just chronological order . 
  also tillerson apparently meets with nato next week . 
  by your strict application of lying , you lied . 
  but she is n't a little boy, 
  that homophobes should not look at it because they would throw a tantrum over it . 
  not wanting to look at it does n't make you a homophobe , but throwing at tantrum over it . 
  rule 34 . 
  if you 're sexually sorted out , this wo n't bother you at all . 
  this . 
  i wonder how this would looks if we included right wing terrorism with single digit death toll . 
  [ in germany between 1990 and 2011 there had been 75 deaths in such attacks . 
  ] ( https://www.gruene-bundestag.de/fileadmin/media/gruenebundestag_de/themen_az/rechtsextremismus/ka_18_5488.pdf ), 
   my box should be bigger and more important than the other boxes it 's just so accurate, 
   it is pretty childish to `` blame a side '' for a heterogeneous group of different attacks with different motives and different perpetrators in different countries . 
  yup , but that 's what you did in your original comment . 
  [ are you referring to this case from 1982 ? 
  ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/declassified-files-link-cia-to-ira-gun-running-35379252.html )  the cia , with a licence to export weapons , had aided their operation in order to monitor the flow of arms to ireland and prevent the ira from turning to the soviet union for arms , the defence claimed . 
   it was a defence the jury found credible - with a female juror telling press they `` firmly believed '' the operation could not have continued without government sanction . 
  it actually sounds very reasonable that the cia did this to monitor and bust them . 
  after all , [ the fbi also setp up such a sting operation in 1981 ] ( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ira/inside/weapons.html ) and busted similar attempts in 1983 and 1985 . 
  exactly , and i am providing you with several terrorist groups the su supported , some of which were operating in europe and others cooperating closely with european terrorist groups . 
  if you do n't know that the plo had close ties to the ira , what are you doing here , then ? 
  the su is the side to blame for that terrorist spree during the cold war , not the other side . 
  you are saying my comparison of the diplomatic behaviour of two heavily controversial , right-wing governments and coming to the conclusion that the behaviour of one of those governments is significantly less diplomatic than that of the other one , was condescending ? 
  how would you have worded it ? 
  of course i am pointing that out , 106 out of those 141 characters were about that . 
  do you need assistance with reading my comment ? 
   just never said that . 
  i 'd agree with the `` you 'd have to be pretty naive not to expect these attacks '' , but them becoming `` more and more frequent '' ? 
  just as one of the top posts currently shows [ the statistics does n't really show that ] ( https://i.redd.it/g9uevfebu4ny.jpg ) . 
  i really have a hard time seeing any major political changes making terrorist attacks more likely . 
  the refugee crisis is over , isis is having quite a hard time . 
  on a sidenote , we have trump ruling ( who promised to end isis ) , we have russia bombing syria to shit ( saying they target isis ) , we have the uk leaving the eu , making it harder to enter the country - expecting more frequent terror attacks would mean that you expect those policies to fail and backfire horribly . 
  look up everything done by the plo , red army faction , national liberation army of bolivia , national liberation army of colombia , democratic front for the liberation of palestine , secret army for liberation of armenia and the popular front for the liberation of palestine then . 
  i 'm pretty damn convinced that the country illegally occupying half of europe and creating a totalitarian regime did far more shit than any democracy ever . 
  oh , that 's a pretty plausible explanation !, 
  see who 's talking about shitty straw man arguments . 
  how about we look at this :  if the result is the same , you wasted a lot of time and money . 
  if the uk follows through with brexit and then , as you suggested , rejoins later , this will have been an unimaginable waste of time and money and basically not even comparable . 
   if the result is to remain in the eu , you did the same , but on top of it you have now disenfranchised everybody who voted for leaving it . 
  that is , you severely undermine the democratic process . 
  respecting a referendum is suddenly undermining democratic process , but it is not when respecting it means brexit . 
  you should be the one to go back to school . 
  you 're probably right , seeing that most historians agree with what you are saying . 
  til . 
  but seeing how libya was such an important source of weapons for the ira , were n't the ties between the su and libya quite close in terms of arms deals during the 70 's and also 80 's ? 
  well , i 'd argue that getting supported by a government is a much powerful thing than getting the support of individuals or criminal organizations . 
  a country has far more resources and ways for that . 
  well i heard that [ the soviet union funded the ira ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kgb-approved-1m-pounds-aid-request-by-party-with-ira-link-peter-pringle-in-moscow-finds-evidence-in-1559647.html ) and that the [ kgb armed the ira ] ( http://irishecho.com/2011/02/kgb-armed-official-ira-book-reveals/ ) , als there was an old , secret ira-stalin agreement . 
  and then again , the ira and the plo had a close cooperation , while the plo was [ backed heavily by the kgb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_and_the_soviet_union ) . 
   the ira got most of it 's weapons from libya and the usa got a source for american government support for the ira ? 
  so far i only know that [ the soviet union funded the ira ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kgb-approved-1m-pounds-aid-request-by-party-with-ira-link-peter-pringle-in-moscow-finds-evidence-in-1559647.html ) and that the [ kgb armed the ira ] ( http://irishecho.com/2011/02/kgb-armed-official-ira-book-reveals/ ) . 
   why everyone who charged with corruption in russia , quickly became putin 's critics i assume it 's only natural to become a putin critic when putin turns on you . 
   and major democratic values lover/supporter ? 
  well , when shit 's hitting the fan , people realize how awesome democracy is .
