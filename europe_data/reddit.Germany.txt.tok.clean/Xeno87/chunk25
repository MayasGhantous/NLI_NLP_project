  guess why we even had all those treaties and independent countries ? 
  we had a short time of diplomatic prosperity , where we settled difficult things , like crimea and ukraine having the second largest nuclear stockpile , through diplomacy . 
  then putin came and literally fucked everything up . 
  seriously , all those tumblr in action posts ? 
  i 'm damn sure 90 % of that is false flag . 
  no , russia 's actions are separating . 
  if you do n't , want that , make russia change its stance . 
   eu disregarding russia utterly and completely , oh stop this bullshit . 
  in 2008 , germany , the uk and france veto 'd ukraine 's and georgia 's nato membership request ** out of concerns for russian interest ** . 
  _ after _ putin theatened to annex parts of those countries !, 
  in 2013 , the eu delayed the ukraine-eu agreement for several months , and well - then maidan happened . 
  we could 've rushed it through , but we did n't . 
  we are respecting russia all the time and everytime we do , we get the bad part of the deal . 
  we did n't go full on embargo after crimea , and ukraine got a huge part chopped off of it because of that . 
  ah ok , that explains it !, 
  where does this headline come from ? 
  how about you stop shitposting somewhere else and provide evidence of [ your claims ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zh5v1/putin_approves_the_merging_of_the_south_ossetian/deyd4eo/?context=3 ) ? 
  good . 
  the uk did get a lot of apeasement , bonusses and extra treatments just to get into/stay in the eu and it did not have any effect , now it should be rigorously treated like any other country . 
   i 'd call this more of a joke than anything that would be a concern . 
  we called trump a joke and now even republicans are [ afraid that there are kgb agents running around the white house ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/323523-bush-ethics-lawyer-knocks-trump-administrations-russia-ties-kgb ), 
  http://imgur.com/geythcz translation : `` heil hitler , we 're investigating the arson-attack '', 
  the eu should not let ukraine down like this . 
  we should have a full trade embargo on russia until it stops funding our right-wing parties , withdraws its troops from ukraine and georgia , returns crimea and complies with the osce agreements again . 
  it saddens me to live in a time where it 's necessary to _ force _ russia to do all this stuff that should be normal . 
  but do n't you dare calling them racist because that 's why they will win !, 
  you must take their anxiety serious !, 
  can we please not pretend that russia is not militarily expanding and expanding under putin ? 
  he thinks `` russia stronk '' . 
  he does n't care about living in peace . 
   you wrote few weeks ago that there is nothing to worry about and we should basically disarm our armies . 
  mind showing me that post ? 
  * edit * : you know , just to give some context for other people around here , i usually post [ stuff like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5uxrij/russia_plotted_to_overthrow_montenegros/ddxq15m/ ) about russia :  russia wants war , russia needs war . 
  we must get rid of putin and his regime if we ever want to have peace in europe again . 
  i 'm now really interested in seeing that post you are referring to . 
  should n't be so hard to find since it can only have been posted in the 3 months you 've been on reddit , . 
  well of course , annexing south ossetia and abkhazia is [ written in his strategy book from 1997 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) : * georgia should be dismembered . 
  abkhazia and `` united ossetia '' ( which includes georgia 's south ossetia ) will be incorporated into russia . 
  georgia 's independent policies are unacceptable . 
  just like annexing ukraine : * ukraine should be annexed by russia because '' `` ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning , no particular cultural import or universal significance , no geographic uniqueness , no ethnic exclusiveness , its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible . 
  the entire fascist ideology is becoming real . 
  lol , nice try troll , try reading a history book . 
  lol . 
  not even close . 
  well ask russia not to change their border every few years , then we would n't have any trouble . 
   this would n't be a problem if ukraine did n't break the rules last year with their political song wait wait wait , let me get this straight : this russian singer performed in crimea . 
  ukrainian law `` gives authorities to the right to bar entry to the country for anyone who has been to the peninsula without crossing the de facto land border and going through ukrainian border control and customs . '', 
  now this is the problem . 
  and now you 're saying if ukraine had won with any other song , this problem would not exist ? 
  how come ? 
  would 've she entered crimea on another route if ukraine had used another song ? 
  what the hell is your comment even supposed to be about ? 
   i think you can also thank trump for showing a prime example of what his kind of politician will do to a country . 
  well it 's not like certain countries have impressively demonstrated that already ... 
  it 's like they want lepen to win . 
  we do n't need a glimpse , russia is operating in broad daylight . 
  it 's just that we literally do n't hold them responsible for it . 
  we appease russia way too much . 
  it 's one thing to promote , another to make shit up and lie with the intention to create unrest . 
  [ you may be sarcastic , but those insane idiots ruling russia are not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) :  the united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
  i considered the possibility that he wants to create tensions to help wilders win the election , but it 's a bit far-fetched . 
  this sounds like turkey is imitating russia . . 
   pretty damn bad for a mainstream politician . 
  looking at it : that 's an understatement . 
  i was horrified to see poland voting those shithead twins and the rest of their gang in , but then again , you are the country of [ solidarno\u015b\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solidarity_ ( polish_trade_union \\ ) ) . 
  you started the end of the soviet union , i have no doubt that you can start the end of this government . 
  well i considered the possibility that anti-turkish ressentiments might help an anti-islam politician . 
  do n't forget that spain was a fascist military dicatorship when it joined nato . 
  so dutchmen , what do you think : can this whole turkey-netherlands thing help wilders in those last days , or does the hard stance the government is putting off help them ? 
  do you think this has any implications for the election ? 
  ( you might want to consider the possibility that i 'm trying to bait `` russia did n't do nothing '' - posters , hence even the remark about russia being poor ), 
  you can blame them for violating their obligions , just like you have to blame france , the uk , china ** and russia ** then . 
  but russia takes the blame for being the shitty country to attack ukraine , so it gets to be the winner of the `` who 's the greatest shit '' - award _ and _ a co-winner of the `` who should 've done more '' - award . 
  overall , i agree with your bottom line message - we should have nuked russia from this earth . 
  it 's so poor ( it 's gdp is of the order of magnitude of spains ) that we would n't even have noticed it being gone . 
  one violated the treaty , the other did n't start ww3 . 
  you ca n't even compare those two , russia is just 100 % the culprit . 
  do n't try that shitty `` but everyone is just as bad '' strategy - russia is 100 % to blame . 
   russian people every time voted for them all 146 % !, 
   russia 's word does not seem to be worth the paper it is written on . 
  well , that 's what you get for appeasing a dictator for 18 years . 
  do n't try to lay the blame on the us , it 's russia that you should blame first and foremost . 
   right now he 's just calling everybody and i mean everybody a nazi . 
  just like putin : it 's projection . 
  well , to be fair , there _ was _ a yugoslavian refugee crisis from 1994-1996 and it went exactly like the recent one ( rise of a right wing party , `` muh rapefugees '' everywhere , horst seehofer ( !! ), 
  calling for stricter immigration laws ) . 
  i was pointing this out several times to those people showing them that we can easily handle such a crisis . 
   so the us , uk and canada are insecure when they build beautiful parliament buildings ? 
  if you build something like this today , and as you suggest , with the _ intention _ to project power , yes you are , and you should rather concentrate on fixing real problems instead of erecting buildings . 
   why do people keep chucking this map around as if it 's proof that leave voters in scotland does n't count ? 
  nobody does it . 
  or are you saying the stay voters do n't count ? 
  and just one month later gagarin would go up . 
  another month after this , the us would send alan shepard to space ( but not achieve orbit ) . 
   there 's no tradition , no grandeur the eu has no tradition . 
   now these are beautiful buildings , tasteful yet project power . 
  who says that we need to project power ? 
  people who do that are just insecure , those who are confident and strong do n't need to show it on every occasion . 
  let those other countries have those century old buildings , we have a 21st century one .
