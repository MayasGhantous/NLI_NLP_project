  [ i think it looks neat ] ( https://tvnewsroom.consilium.europa.eu/uploads/council-images/thumbs/uploads/council-images/remote/http_7e18a1c646f5450b9d6d-a75424f262e53e74f9539145894f4378.r8.cf3.rackcdn.com/dd42d664-b8a9-11e6-9a5d-bc764e093073_45.61_thumb_169_1481038650_1481038649_800_450_80_c1.jpg ), 
   but what about all the people who voted ` no ' in the last referendum ? 
  having a new referendum so soon is essentially saying that those people were `` wrong '' and dismissive of their votes . 
  remember this ? 
   [ what is process for removing our eu citizenship ? 
  voting yes . 
  #scotdecides ] ( https://twitter.com/uk_together/status/506899714923843584 ) the conditions for leave/stay were completely different back then , and many people were influenced by the outlook of leaving the eu if they voted for independence . 
  after this game changer , a new referendum is a justified cause . 
   she 's also dismissing leave voters in scotland . 
   it 's pointless without a reference point . 
  without this it would be pointless to draw conclusions to brexit . 
  however , it still speaks pretty strong about the workplace climate of doctors in the uk and that it is really , really troublesome . 
  such a huge number should not be . 
  * edit * : also , as a reference point :  of those who responded , 60 % ( 1,280 ) said they were considering leaving the uk at some point in the future , and , of those doctors , ** 91 % said the uk 's decision to leave the eu was a factor in their considerations . 
  **  massey said two primary reasons were cited for considering abandoning careers in britain : `` firstly , a question of whether or not doctors felt valued working in the nhs , and secondly , the uncertainty over the continuing future residency status . '', 
  do n't forget that nasa gets 4 times the budget of esa . 
  a huge portion of the materials esa produces is in cooperation with companies or scientific collaborations , meaning that those have a say concerning the rights of said material . 
   force a more open and radical debate there you are using it again . 
  are you copy pasting that from somewhere ? 
  what do you _ mean _ by this ? 
  why was the discussion _ not _ open before and why does it _ need _ to be radical ? 
  no , he 's white , he 's mentally ill . 
  i like you . 
  we were discussing this every year of the eu 's existence . 
  and what do you mean with `` more open and radical '' ? 
  were some people not allowed to say certain things ? 
   redditor since 5 months  the_dipshit poster  clinton was controlled by soros  war in ukraine is not waged by russia  tinfoil everywhere i fucking knew it . 
  a wacko talking about himself fact checking . 
   then why do we need a `` fact checking site '' if we can check them ourselves ? 
  because you do n't have to know or search the sources yourself . 
   we do n't need an intermediary . 
  we do n't need other people to tell us with is true and what is n't when it comes to this . 
  ... you do realize what we 're doing on reddit all the time in the comment section , right ? 
  the funniest bit about projects like this : rightwingers ( it 's always them ) crying about censorship and propaganda , when it 's nothing more than debunking stories with a lot sources and material . 
  so the very same that happens in reddit comments all the time, 
  you , by checking their sources . 
  you know , the same that happens on reddit when someone posts bullshit and is called out and corrected - with sources . 
   why do you think these 2 that smuggled themselves in as syrian refugees did in the middle east ? 
  so you 're advocating for closed borders so that people ca n't _ leave _ anymore ? 
   if the situation with the mass migration did not happen its very likely that they would n't have been able to smuggle themselves and would have potentially been caught by the security services that were monitoring them the ywere caught , and then freed . 
  the problem here is the lack of cooperation of european police agencies , not `` open borders '' . 
  * salah abdeslam : born in brussels * brahim abdeslam : salah abdeslam 's brother , born in brussels * abdelhamid abaaoud : he grew up in the brussels district of molenbeek * chakib akrouh : was born and raised in belgium * omar ismail mostefai : 29-year-old french national * samy amimour : frenchman , who lived in the north-eastern paris suburb of drancy * foued mohamed-aggad : born in wissembourg , france * bilal hadfi : french national * ` ahmad al-mohammad ' : ** the man may have been posing as a syrian refugee . 
  ** [ but what 's that ? ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11996120/paris-attack-what-we-know-about-the-suspects.html ) ? 
   federica mogherini , the eu 's chief diplomat , said all the attackers are believed to be eu citizens , however , raising the possibility the man was using the fake passport to re-enter europe , possibly because his real identity was on a watch list . 
  * 'm al-mahmod ' : he entered the greek island of leros on 3 october , travelling with ahmad al-mohammed . 
  so , about the open borders - all attackers were from the eu except two guys where definite proof of their identity is still unclear , however it 's extremely likely that they were eu citizens that had to conceal their idenities . 
  also those guys were arrested in greece for faked passports , but let go . 
  blaming `` open borders '' ( which we do n't have , and no country on earth has closed borders except north korea ) is pretty damn ignorant in this case - the attack would have happened with or without the refugee crisis as all attackers were eu citizens . 
  / u/ourari is right , the problems are not from open borders . 
  [ sure ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-12/terrorism20161219.png ) . 
  it 's taken from [ here ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015 ) . 
  http://imgur.com/etjztmd * edit * : [ larger graph ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-12/terrorism20161219.png ), 
   last week , thomas de maizi\u00e8re and bruno le roux , respectively the german and french ministers of the interior , sent a letter to the european commission calling for measures to stem what they see as a tide of terrorism sweeping the land .

  no , he wanted to live far away and independent from government control in his boat . 
  guess who also has an interest in staying as far as possible from the reach of government ? 
  abu sayyaf is around since the early 90 's and was responsible for the 2004 ferry bombing with more than a hundred dead civillians . 
  where have you been the last decades ? 
  i beg to differ - i now neither know how to insult nor lay somebody . 
  you mean likethose bazillions in new york that danced when trumps tower became the highest in ny ? 
  so what 's the point of your comment ? 
  the uk has to renegoiate access to the galileo system because it withdraws from all contracts that settled it . 
  how is this a `` claim we could be locked out '' ? 
  this is n't a claim , it 's a consequence of brexit , and the uk has to renegotiate it or lose access . 
  i 'm sorry that you are fed up with articles stating how many stuff the uk has to renegotiate or loses access to , but that 's just how it is if you leave the eu . 
   mr kerevan told the independent : `` there is technology there reserved for member states to use for public services , and the uk could be locked out . 
  i 'm sure that a deal will be done , and the uk could could pay its whack and get access , but ** it 's just another part of brexit that no one 's actually thought about . 
  ** yup . 
  looks a lot like nobody even bothered to think about the work and implications brexit will bring . 
  so the uk has to negotiate another thing and will most likely have to pay up for the same services . 
  you would n't believe , but 1.6 billion muslims wo n't do either . 
  so what would have been an appropriate response by the us in your opinion ? 
   redditor since 3 months [ and here we go again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5w9jvb/boris_nemtsov_killing_supporters_to_march_in/de8fbyc/ ), 
  ... soo ... are you now blaming the us for not starting ww3 or are you blaming russia for needlessly creating an incident that could have easily started ww3 ? 
  we should embargo russia and lock them out of internet , money and trading flows until we figure out what 's going on . 
   / r/europe  dnc shithole weird . 
  it 's almost as if i found one of the people.i was referring to . 
   redditor since 3 months man , reddit went right wing and downhill after 2014 . 
  ukraine gave up the second largest nuclear stockpile in the world in return for russian security assurances . 
  thanks to that maniac in moscow , no country in the right mind will ever again give up on nukes . 
   redditor since 7 days . 
  why are all those putin loving accounts so new ? 
  there are very , very few putin loving accounts that were created before 2014 , but an army of such accounts that were created afterwards . 
  well , the new aristocracy is grabbing the power and those racist dumbfucks who give it to them ca n't even see that . 
  100 precent sure it was the one country in europe that used its military to extend its borders several times in the last twenty years and is ruled by a former kgb agent . 
  because the baltics are based as fuck and do n't take no russian shit no more . 
  well it does work in russia or any other authoritarian regime , does n't it ? 
  i do n't recall the democratic movement being a factor in russia . 
  yeah , sorry , but i stopped being optimistic . 
  _ yet _ . 
  imagine what happens if schulz wins - a charismatic guy , a hyped movement , taking over from the conservative government , finally everything is going to change . 
  [ remember this ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/barack_obama_hope_poster.jpg ) obama could n't live up to his hype because politics is hard and he is only human . 
  and even tohugh he did nothing wrong , not living up to the hype was what ultimately broke his neck ( well , and the obstruction by the reps ) . 
  so what if schulz actually wins ? 
  he wo n't be able to live up to the hype , and if we 're unlucky , the rightists will gain momentum from this . 
  i mean , i would have no problem with that if it was bugged by our secret services so that we can gain information and use that to topple those authoritarian regimes . 
  but i doubt that we do that . 
   i doubt le pen will gain power we doubted brexit , we doubted trump .
