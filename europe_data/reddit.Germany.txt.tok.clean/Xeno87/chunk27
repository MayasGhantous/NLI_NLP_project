  i changed my expectations , now i expect the fascists to win every election , no matter how it looks in the polls . 
   how widespread would you say it is ? 
  they currently range between 15 and 8 percent in polls , and in eastern germany and lower saxony , they are surprisingly strong actually . 
   and do you think germany 's migrant policy substantially increased these knob jockeys ? 
  so , i 'd say the existence of a refugee crisis is in most parts to blame for this . 
  we had a similar refugee crisis during the yugoslavian wars 1994 , and back then , another right wing party skyrocketed - [ the republikans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_republicans_ ( germany \\ ) ) . 
  but as soon as the crisis was over , they significantly lost votes and today , only range on levels < 0.5 % . 
  so , i 'd think the refugee crisis itself is the reason for the afd parties ' success , not the actual migrant policy itself . 
   hitler wrote `` mein kampf '' because he was silenced . 
  lol no , he was n't . 
  if he had been silenced , that book would 've never seen the day of light . 
  he was jailed for throwing a coup d'etat and instead of going hard on him , he was appeased . 
  appeasement makes fascists stronger , the more you tolerate them , talk with them , reason with them , the stronger they get . 
  those guys were n't a problem in western germany for 60 years because people immediatly were outraged if someone showed such thinking . 
   the more you try to push people away from something , the more interesting it becomes to disadvantaged people . 
  no , not at all . 
  the guy screaming `` the end is near '' ? 
  nobody takes him serious , and that 's why there are n't people grouping around him , that 's basic humand behavior . 
  being shunned does n't get you any friends . 
  * edit * : just a few instances to show that silencing actually works and that going hard on a movement does not make people support them more : the communist movement in the usa is basically negligible because it was silenced hard . 
  the same applies to every democratic movement in any autocratic country , for example russia . 
  there virtually is no democratic movement at all . 
  or china . 
  an example how `` appeasement '' or tolerance helps movements , take the democratic movement in the german democratic republic - there was basically none , _ until _ the regime showed signs of weakness and some protests did go untargeted . 
  as soon as that happened and there was n't a major crackdown on them afterwards , people saw that weakness , gained courage to take a stand and only then the movement gained power . 
  i disagree . 
  silencing them works well as they can not spurt their bullshit and it works even better with broad access proper education . 
  victim mentality ? 
  sorry , but they already do that as soon as someone calls them out on their bullshit , they just take anything to be the victim . 
  if you actually silence them , they ca n't victimize themselves even more , instead you are just giving no shit on their opinion , which will earn your movement more respect .

   instead of putting ideas that could not actually stand up to public scrutiny into a position where they have to be confronted and their flaws exposed you want to push them underground where they can spread in the absence of reason it worked damn well in west germany for 60 years . 
  i 'd say we give it another try . 
  also , there is no `` underground '' . 
  their ideology only spreads when being tolerated , when they are in the open spurting bullshit and nobody forces them to stop . 
  just economic anxiety . 
  we got ta try to understand those people !, 
  this is said _ again _ in germany . 
  i thought we were over this . 
   he tasked his secretary of defense with coming up with a plan nonononono , that 's not what he promised . 
  he knows more about isis than the generals . 
  [ he said he would knock them out fast ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-massive-ground-force-may-be-needed-to-fight-isis/ ) . 
  his secretary of defense is n't qualified for that , he 's a general , and [ trump knows it better than him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kul34o_ymls ) . 
  so why task an unqualified guy ? 
  because he does n't want to fight isis ? 
  because the only thing he did was bombing some civillians in yemen so far . 
   how does russia directly profit ? 
  refugees in europe , higher oil price , higher demand for oil because war , more demand for russian weapons , more influence because he protects his friend assad and can blackmail the west as long as there 's isis ... 
  almost every head of isis in syria was imprisoned in tadmor for a time . 
  [ that 's why the very first thing isis did when taking palmyra was blowing it up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadmor_prison ) . 
  they met in there . 
   the un intervention that russia blocked was for a no-fly zone that was targeting assad oh really , all eight of it ?

  oh yeah , sorry , you are right . 
  did misread an article . 
   because that 's what you 're implying . 
  that 's what burqa ban supporters often imply , not me . 
  i 'm showing that this is n't the case . 
  ~ ~ on a side note , notice that this proposal by bavaria is most likely going to be scrapped by the federal court as it seems to be unconstitutional . 
  this is also what chancellor merkel thinks . ~ ~ misread article , this ban as discussed here is apparently constitutional . 
  bear in mind that germany is only allowed to have a maximum number of 370.000 soldiers . 
  we currently do n't have conscription which makes it hard to find recruits , and if we were to implement conscription again , we would have more than we are allowed to . 
   it has worked okay in france , belgium , chad , italy , bulgaria , and switzerland . 
  i 'm not disencouraging this ban we are discussing here in the comments ( and we must discuss ski mask problem ) , but how did it work in those countries ? 
  it was banned and then . . ? 
  terrorist disappeared ? 
  muslim women instantaneously integrated ? 
  `` something works '' is different from `` nothing happened '' . 
   hollande and obama also vowed to crush them but not with those strong words like trump and putin . 
  exactly , it 's not easy . 
  so why do these two idiots pretend it is ? 
  funfact , why do you ignore the fact that russia blocked every un intervention for syria and also encouraged and supported assad in his regime , maintaining his torture prison in plamyra where the isis heads met and founded isis ? 
  oh , i can think of a reason ... 
  sure . 
  they said they would crush them and they did n't do anything . 
  of course i can blame them for being lying shits . 
  do n't you have to work right now ... ? 
  * edit * : wait - would fuck over the lives of your pupils just to make a point ( instead of protesting against said tax ) ? 
   the creator of the graphs considered the government of poland to be radical right for example and they do n't seem much worse than american republicans says something about the republicans . 
  i can understand the creator 's judgement here , from objective standpoints , both those parties currently act like the nsdap , just without an insane leader with absolute power . 
  see , exactly that 's why i want this to be a tax - to directly support the education budget , so that it becomes increasingly hard for people to develop thinking like this . 
  sorry , that 's normal in 2017 . 
  i 'm all for going back to the good days , but that requires that we win our hybrid war against russia . 
  no problem , just take the consequences . 
  if you do not care about your society , you got ta pay to make up for it . 
  that 's why it 's a tax . 
  it 's the same as during the us election . 
  it 's incredibly close all the time and in the end it 's so close that with a little bit of vote manipulation or voter supression you can grab just the win if you wanted . 
  lock her up as a foreign agent , investigate the shit out of her and seize her assets in the meantime . 
  i 'm totally for an additional tax you have to pay if you did n't vote last election as well as another tax if you did n't attend a certain percentage of town hall meetings per year . 
  [ notice the amount of radical right ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ija9371.jpg ) . 
  there 's only one time where radical right had so many votes like today , and it 's 1933 . 
   fleischpflanzerl  fleischlaberl  fleischk\u00fcchle wtf is wrong with you south germans ?? 
  i 'm a tolerant guy but this is too much .
