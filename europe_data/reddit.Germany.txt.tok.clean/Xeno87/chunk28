  redditor for the trump campaign , who would 've thought, 
  fuck , if those snowflakes ca n't handle being called ... what exactly ? 
   stormfront and olgino are brigading this comment section , beginning now . 
  they need to push le pen after the latest polls . 
  not sure what i called , but if ** that ** triggers them and makes them leave , fuck yeah , i 'm gon na keep doing that . 
  #make / r/europe left again, 
  yeah , so when do you tell us what constitutes a nazi party ? 
  you already showed that the party is extremely tied to and basically equivalent with its leader , unlike other democratic parties , so what 's the rest ? 
  so you 're saying she 's even less qualified than hitler because she ca n't write ? 
  also , it 's funny that you go from `` fn '' to `` lepen '' . 
  looks like lepen is the party . 
  hmm ... where did i hear that ... 
   the front national is not a nazi party so , what was the nazi party in 1933 like ? 
  tell me about their positions , because , protip , gassing or killings jews was not one of them . 
   and yet if you see anyone in here that supports her , you assume they ca n't be a real french person but must be a `` stormfront brigader '' . 
  no , i 'm saying this because stormfront _ is _ brigading here . 
  do you think you ca n't see their communication and monitor their actions ? 
   can you elucidate further why you find it unlikely a genuine french lepen supporter might be found in / r/europe ? 
  because this is reddit and / r/europe , not a french retirement home . 
  it will happen exactly the same shit as we saw with brexit : hundreds of ukip and brexit supporters spreadin their shit , and after it 's over , 90 % of them are gone . 
  i am more worried that we do n't treat her as the traitor and foreign agent she so obviously is . 
  we all know that the afd is getting russian money washed through `` patriotic millionaires '' . 
  we said that about brexit and trump , too . 
  the internet _ changes _ shit . 
  that whole shift to the right during the last 10 years ? 
  that 's the internet and internet comments . 
  / r/europe will get flooded with fn voters und lepen supporters during the next months and all you will see is lepen , lepen , lepen ... 
   ( something i think of is that one of their subs while on the baltic sea might have a problem and it had to vent but the hell will freeze over before we learn anything about that ) yeah , that 's something that was talked about immediatly and it also coincides with the [ constant phoenix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boeing_wc-135_constant_phoenix ) being flown over from florida to europe . 
  however , such a situation would release other radioactive materials that could be detected . 
  irsn already stated that those materials you would expect from nuclear tests or vessels were not found , making the medical plant more likely . 
  one possibility i can think of is that a russian medical plant illegally dumped its waste in the arctic region . 
  it would coincide with the locatio nas well as the spectrum of found radioactive material . 
  stormfront and olgino are brigading this comment section , beginning now . 
  they need to push le pen after the latest polls . 
  so , did n't putin want to `` crush isis '' ? 
  russia started to intervene in 2015 , but only managed to bomb aleppo to shit . 
  and did n't trump promise to crush isis in a month with his super secret plan he would not tell anybody ? 
  why is isis still a thing ? 
  can it be because those two guys directly profit from isis terror on other countries ? 
  nah , that ca n't be true ... it must obviously mean that russia and the us are shit and a few thousand religious savages in the desert are too much for them . 
  you can just move to russia if you prefer that country . 
  do n't need a vichy regime for that . 
  i do , and the october incident strangely shadows the current one :  the safety authority said that the origin of the radioactive iodine was not known and that the substance was detected in rovaniemi , helsinki , and loviisa between october 19 and 25 . 
   officials in neighbouring estonia also reported small amounts of radioactive iodine in air samples in the capital tallinn and in narva , near the russian border in eastern estonia . 
  russia , russia russia ... i find that suspicious . 
  the parent comment our chain is commenting on , does too . 
  [ that 's not what the official source , the irsn , says  ( http://www.irsn.fr/en/newsroom/news/pages/20170213_detection-of-radioactive-iodine-at-trace-levels-in-europe-in-january-2017.aspx )  the preliminary report states it was first found during week 2 of january 2017 in northern norway . 
  * edit * : this is a different incident . 
  also , i did see your edit . 
  [ guess what i commented on already ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5va8sm/nobody_is_sure_what_caused_a_mysterious_radiation/de0xn9v/ )  it seems a bit unlikely that it 's the same source this time since the first detection was in the arctic , near the russian kola peninsula . 
  back then , it was first detected in the czech republic . 
  the first detection was right on the border to russia , and suspiciously , russion stations did not report at all on iodine levels . 
   dear trump administration , if you want to get more nato funding from your european partners [ trump called nato `` obsolete '' ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/world/europe/donald-trump-nato.html ) . 
  the tough call for more funding is just the excuse to make nato unattractive and eventually disband it . 
  it seems a bit unlikely that it 's the same source this time since the first detection was in the arctic , near the russian kola peninsula . 
  back then , it was first detected in the czech republic . 
   so a ) its secret obviously , since nobody has claimed responsibility and such a release can neither occur naturally nor go undetected by the source . 
   b ) you already know that its russian / u/rettaw said `` most likely ''  c ) you already know they are cheating he is suggesting it could be improper handling  d ) and you already know its for medicine use [ he 's justified in thinking so ] ( https://twitter.com/irsnfrance/status/833719187554050049 ), 
   the so called '' useful idiots '' . 
  farage , le pen , petry , wilders , etc. 
  are nothing but useful idiots from kremlins point of view . 
  no , they are traitors and collaborators . 
   are you gon na get away with that one ? 
  yes , they are . 
  they got away with attacking and annexing parts of ukraine , georgia and chechnya . 
  they even announced this in their [ military strategy textbook ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics#content ) , written twenty years ago . 
  they are not even hiding it , and we are doing nothing . 
  she met with the guy who , in front of the russian parliament , called for [ a bombing of paris and a total eradication of all germans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh4pvjmv-o8 ) . 
  funfact : his party is called `` liberal democratic party of russia '' and is basically a nazi party . 
  and if you would invest half of the time you type shitty reddit comments into researching the causal connection between poverty and crime as well as immigration and poverty , you might actually identify the problem in a few weeks and can offer actual solutions !, 
  oh wait , but i guess its easier to blame `` dem immigrants '' . 
  weird , that 's not what worldnews tells me about chinese tourists . 
  but welp , the thing is that this is exactly what i 'm saying . 
  but where i am differing from you alt reichers is : i attribute it to the fact ( i have repeatedly pointed out ) that chinese immigrants in the netherlands were students . 
  you attribute it to race alone ( funfact : that makes you a racist ), 
  true , we ca n't really compare rape statistics , because those are often inherently different definitions differing from country to country . 
  what is considered rape in germany might not even be reported and investigated in russia , where domestic violence is much more common . 
  but we can still compare murder , because you ca n't handle that differently - and there it is grim : germany has 8.44 murders per 100k , russia has 102.35 per 100k . 
   yes , ** now ** we have rich students coming over , but that is not the same as the people that came over in containers on a intercontinental freighter ship . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_people_in_the_netherlands  another group of early ethnic chinese in the netherlands were students ; they were largely not from china , however , but were instead drawn from among chinese communities in the dutch east indies . 
  from a group of 20 in ** 1911 ** , their numbers continued to increase , interrupted only by world war ii ; in ** 1957 ** , out of the roughly 1,400 ethnic chinese from indonesia in the netherlands , 1,000 were students . 
   though the number of chinese students from indonesia dropped off , tens of thousands of ethnic chinese were forced to leave the country due to the violent political situation in indonesia in ** 1965 ** . 
   also in the ** 1980s ** , the netherlands began to become a popular choice for students from mainland china . 
  try to fix your shitty attitude and do n't go round trying to point to people imply they are liars just because it does not support your narrative . 
  i 'm going round calling alt-reichers racist for saying that crime and violence is inherently coupled to being chinese or `` arabic '', 
  so if there is no correlation , why are rape and murder so much more common in russia and ukraine , but not in wealthier countries ? 
  that 's not what wikipedia says . 
  weird , why are all people replying to me not quoting sources ? 
  oh right , because they make that shit up as they go . 
   that 's quite the backpedal no , that 's just the first instance of said laws . 
  there are enough studies showing the legal hurdles keeping immigrants poor , have fun , i gave you the start . 
  proof that these riots are from third generation immigrants ? 
  third generation. , does that mean they are came there in the 1950 's ? 
  hot damn , savage europeans . 
   take my word no sorry , trustworthy sources please . 
  because just from memory , / u/xeno87 is a billionaire . 
  having the chinese immigrant discussing in here as well . 
  chinese immigrants were wealthier and also students when they came . 
  too bad that you ca n't compare similar situations .
