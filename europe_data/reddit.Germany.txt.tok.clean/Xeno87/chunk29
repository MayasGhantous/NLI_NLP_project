  more than a stormfront brigaded reddit thread, 
   legal immigrants are not asylum seekers they sure are . 
  asylum seekers are as legal as it can get . 
  also , the lack of proof shadows your lack of insight, 
  basically that if you request asylum , you have to wait until your request is completely processed and decided , and sometimes , even then you have to get additional permits . 
  because i trust scientists more than reddit commenters, 
  it 's amazing that german culture was supposed to never change and always be the savage war mongering culture . 
   you do n't even know the difference between immigration and asylum . 
  sure i do . 
  but you people do n't make a difference, 
  proof ? 
  how did they move all the way from china to the netherlands without anything ? 
  the funny thing is , wikipedia says something different than your comment :  another group of early ethnic chinese in the netherlands were students  also in the 1980s , the netherlands began to become a popular choice for students from mainland china . 
  students , students everywhere . 
  it 's almost like education is the best weapon against poverty, 
   i would never question a random comment on the internet, 
  proof ? 
   where are legal immigrants not allowed to work ? 
  asylum seekers have to wait until their status ist completely confirmed and they are granted asylum before they are even allowed to searche for work . 
  all other countries have similar laws to prevent asylum seekers from working before their request is completely decided , which takes months to years . 
  can you go a year without money ? 
  you do n't even know immigration laws in europe , no wonder you have no clue . 
  what , now this is regular . 
  show me , how many riots were in this district before ? 
   what about many of the chinese immigrants we have in the netherlands for example ? 
  oh , were they fleeing war with absolutely nothing of worth to their name , too ? 
  lol , find me the sentence in the article where it says mass rapes and murder and i might give you a source . 
  and as a nice example , why did the red army , consisting of poor people from all over russia , rape the shit out of everything , while rapes in the western front , where the soldiers where from wealthy nations , were so , * so * less common ? 
  inb4 `` hurr but there was rape in west too '', 
  you have to be either blind or closing your eyes to not see that all over europe there are laws and regulations keeping immigrants poor and/or prohibiting them to work . 
  and poverty is the number one cause of crime , not heritage . 
  it 's amazing how people here blame crime on heritage and not lack of wealth . 
  guess why there was crime before immigrants ? 
  oh wait , that does n't fit their agenda . 
  it 's not our problem that putin is unimaginative . 
  and most people would be glad if they did !, 
  and that was written twenty years ago . 
  maybe they were joking . 
  or drunk/stoned . 
  they see this as a trait .

   we could go full on embargo against russia and ban it from swift there are your sanctions . 
  not war , sanctions . 
  oh , i 'm listing a few other things here , too . 
  why are you so quick to ignore them ? 
  also :  because if you 're going into comparisons , then do compare it with middle east and result of us and saudi financing not just extremists , but real terrorist organisations whose actions are not comparable at all . 
  with terrorist organizations , do you include those `` seperatists '' in eatsern ukraine and georgia ? 
  because those are terrorists , too , and directly controlled by russia . 
  and seeing how you are talking about proof , i ca n't see any legit proof of the us funding terrorist organizations in syria . 
  if you do n't like this stuff , tell russia to stop it , not me . 
   you can read western press in russia . 
  you can access the internet . 
  great . 
  does n't change the fact that state propaganda dominates everything by a large margin . 
  people in the gdr could watch and listen to western media , too . 
  still did n't change approval ratings . 
  weird , huh ? 
  it 's almost as if dictatorships make those up . 
   you proposed getting rid of putin and imposing pretty extreme sanctions on russia ? 
  how is that defence ? 
  how is that securing peace ? 
  well , let me put it simply : putin gone = [ no shit like this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5uxrij/russia_plotted_to_overthrow_montenegros/ddxtx8r/ ) . 
  we are discussing an article accusing russia of overthrowing montenegros government . 
  that is an act of war , you know . 
   russia will start a war if you threaten its very existence , even if you do it economically . 
  so , then we are morally allowed to start a war against russia as it threatens the existence of the eu . 
  sorry , if those are the rules , then we can follow them , too . 
   sorry , but no that is not something you can debate . 
  even if you want to see it as a dictatorship , you can hardly deny that the russian people support putin . 
  that is something i can debate . 
  all soviet leaders , including gorbatchev , had support levels of  90 % at all times , even right before the collapse of the soviet union . 
  approval ratings in dictatorships do n't have any value . 
   so you are advocating a war agains russia to create peace ? 
  war that could easily turn nuclear if one were to threaten the very existence of russia ? 
  sorry but that is just madness . 
  i 'm supporting to fight against russian aggression , that 's called defense . 
   and that would most likely just provoke a hot war if you were to do that . 
  so russia would start a war over economy ? 
  that would prove that they wanted war in the first place . 
  it 's our decision who we trade with , not russias . 
  well , i have another , better metric for warmongering : [ military exercises ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2tlbfrp.png ) . 
  russia is violating osce regulations by holding military exercises with more than 10.000 soldiers , without anouncing them or agreeing for observers . 
  then , it is financing all extremist parties throughout europe , flooding us with propaganda while also hacking our parliaments . 
  it violates treaties almost on a weekly basis , it extends its borders , it stages coups in european countries . 
  you say you do n't want war ? 
  well that 's nice , but russia apparently does . 
  also , i 'm not arguing for a direct war against russia . 
  we can go full embargo on russia and ban it from swift , we can ourselves hack it , fund enemies of putin , destabalize the country until it collapses . 
  also , seeing how life in the west is so much better than in russia , why are n't there any bordering regions in russia that want to seceed ? 
  maybe we can convince some of those regions that leaving russia and joining the democratic west ist in their interest . 
  well , the first part was damn convincing , only the second part made it obvious . 
  maybe some redditors did n't continue reading after the comma . 
   putin has the support of his people that 's debatable as russia is a dictatorship without a free press . 
   we wo n't build peace in europe against russia . 
  russia is the only threat for peace in europe currently , so i 'd say it leaves us no other choice  you also simply wo n't be able to remove putin without war . 
  what , several commenters just told me how the west changed several regimes without actual war , i 'm sure we can do that again . 
  we can use russias invention of hybrid warfare , we could go full on embargo against russia and ban it from swift . 
  seeing the absolute undiverse russian economy , its collapse is just a matter of time then .
