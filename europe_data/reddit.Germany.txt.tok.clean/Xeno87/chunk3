  it 's not like ttip failed ( i 'm assuming it will ) because of valid arguments , it failed because somehow a majority was against it even though there was n't even a finished paper . 
  i do n't agree . 
  it 's only `` more of the same old stale shit '' because nobody properly informs themselves . 
  i know ** nobody ** that comes to my cities ' local council that is n't in a party . 
  speaking of parties , the membership numbers go down rapidly since 1990 . 
  i 'm damn sure you ca n't name the difference stances of cdu , spd , greens and lefts in your city concerning even one single topic , just like everybody else that tells me `` it 's all the same '' . 
  if those people would sit their asses down and actually look into parliament discussions and decisions then they would know the difference instantly . 
  but , nope , it 's way easier to just do n't do the shit that is necessary in a democracy and instead just blame others . 
  unless some weird , populist , pro-russian candidate is elected as president of the us . 
   and , just wondering , do you even know the predecessors and why they failed ? 
  guess why i asked you this . 
  because if you would know this , you would know why the answer you just gave me pretty much is nonsense . 
  i am damn sure that if you read up on this stuff , how negotiations work , how many predecessors there already where , how many parliaments rejected them for what reason , then you would think completely different about this . 
  * edit * : also , _ them _ is way too easy . 
  who do you mean with that ? 
  we 're talking about 28 parliaments here , all with several political fractions that can ' e even agree on where they want to eat during break . 
  are you honestly saying that all those , hundreds of political parties compromised of thousands and tens of thousands of people , have exactly the same goal and completele agree , but they just make up their fights and live-streamed discussions as a sort of play for you , someone who does n't even listen to this , just so you do n't rebel against this ? 
  damn , this seems like a damn lot of work . 
  whho writes the script for this play ? 
  those guys deserve an emmy , definitely . 
   usually such trade deals are kept secret this is not true . 
  trade deals are _ always _ openly discussed in parliament when it comes to passing them , which means that everyone can look into that . 
  ttip is not a secret at all , the _ negotations _ and drafts are behind closed doors , because that is just normal . 
  the final agreement will be open for everyone to read . 
  this makes it even more surprising that somehow all the critics do n't even wait until negotiations have finished , meaning that they have absolutely no clue what they are talking about . 
   instead you have to rely on leaks well , unless you do n't want to wait , yes , and we are discussing a leak right here and again , there is no quote , _ nothing _ , not even in the pdf from greenpeace . 
  again , this means that it is not possible for me to fact check what greenpeace is stating . 
  not to mention that discussing leaks is pretty often a waste of time since the drafts change very much over the course of the negotiations . 
  * edit * : take for example [ acta , the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-counterfeiting_trade_agreement ) . 
  [ also negotiated in secret ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-counterfeiting_trade_agreement#negotiations ) , like literally everything is , it was [ released in april ** 2010 ** after negotiations finished ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=552 ) ( in _ all _ eu languages btw ) . 
  acta was publicly discussed in parliaments throughout europe for almost ** 2 years ** until it , finally , was rejected . 
  so there was 2 years of time for every citizen to read it and object to it . 
  well , of course , because this _ is _ the sole reason for trade agreements - to make trade easier !, 
  but you seem convinced that there is an unjust desire to adopt such an agreement , no matter what , right ? 
  but this is weird - `` they 'll just keep trying '' means that they tried before and it was not adopted . 
  like ... as if there is a working mechanism that prevents bad agreements to be passed . 
  i mean , what are you criticizing here ? 
  that ** all ** predecessor agreements did not pass ? 
  or that there is a wish to get a functioning trade agreement to make trade easier ? 
  and , just wondering , do you even know the predecessors and _ why _ they failed ? 
  because this would seem mighty important if you wanted to criticize the process . 
  weird , everytime i see an article about how bad ttip , ceta or another trade deal is , even if it 's about an alleged leak , there is _ never _ a direct quote of the actual lines that are said to be problematic . 
  again here , it says `` oh this is going to happen , and this , and this '' , but no proof of this claim is provided . 
  it 's almost like those authors do n't want me to fact check their opinion . 
  i 'm sure you can easily show similarities and differences between germany in spring of 1939 and russia in summer of 2016 . 
  well , make up an article stating that the us plans to merge fbi , cia and nsa into one even more powerful secret service and check out the comments on / r/news and / r/worldnews on why this is bad and that the us has become nazi germany . 
  looks like they are working hard : * [ two monuments for stalin revealed ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russian-monuments-to-stalin-highlight-controversy-over-his-legacy-49472 ) * [ half of poll respondents agree with `` the price paid by the soviet people in the stalin epoch was justified by great aims and results . 
  '' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11506970/proportion-of-russians-who-respect-stalin-is-growing-poll-suggests.html ) * [ stalin wiped from soviet gulag prison museum ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31711287 ) , and shortly after [ it was closed ] ( http://rbth.com/society/2015/03/06/soviet-era_gulag_museum_ngo_perm-36_announces_closure_44297.html ) revival attempts of stalin may not so far away from truth ... 
  annexing the rest of czechoslovakia actually was the point when hitler unmasked himself . 
  this was the first time he could not hide behind the argument of protecting the german minority anymor and was unable to use pseudo-legal tricks . 
  before , he already invaded the rhineland , austria and the sudetenland , after which he was treated just as putin is treated today , as someone you could still negotiat etc. 
  annexing the rest of ukraine or the baltics would be putins unmasking . 
  if their happiness stayed in their own country then i guess nobody would have a problem with that ... 
  til russia is like my spoiled nephew - just taking one bite ( out of georgia , moldavia , ukraine ) and then wanting something new . 
  but still , 81 % approval rating for putin . 
  starve for the f\u00fchrer . 
  there 's no need to learn from history , just keep repeating it . 
  one day it will certainly work . 
  to give the illusion of a fair vote , cameras were installed to broadcast the voting process to the internet . 
  well , guess those two ladies were n't told where that camera was and they obstructed the wrong direction ... 
  the historically low voter turnout is a pretty good sign that putin and united russia are not that popular . 
  also , it 's not about making them win , but about the right ones win and the wrong ones lose . 
  usually , citizens are allowed to watch and monitor the counting ( which is also what election observers do ) . 
  just straight out making up the votes would be even more obvious . 
  finland is member of the eu . 
  an attack against an eu member state would trigger the mutual defense clause ( [ article 42.7 ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_article_427_an_explainer5019 ) ) and drag nato members into a war with russia . 
  so i guess you are pretty save . 
  well , unless the [ us ] ( http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nbc-fires-donald-trump-after-he-calls-mexicans-rapists-and-drug-runners.jpg ) and [ uk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/a/ae/20160713172905!theresa_may_uk_home_office_ ( cropped \\ ) . jpg ) adopt isolationist policies and france gets a [ putin-phile ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/le_pen,_marine-9586.jpg/170px-le_pen,_marine-9586.jpg ) president . 
  in that case , there would be no country with nukes left anymore to help you and you would have to rely on the conventional armies of the other eu member states . 
  you know , unlike you , other people might actually have read the article or know about the differences between fsb and former kgb . 
  for them , those are not mere words , but things they know something about , like numbers , powers , authorizations , budgets , command structures , even names of people !, 
   what an idiotic thing to say . 
  yeah , wish you would say that for your comments . 
  there has never , _ ever _ been a society with better social and economic security than the eu , with a higher standard of justice . 
  you brat are crying at the achievements of the most just system ** ever ** built in the history of mankind because you have no idea how it looks like in the rest of the world and how it was before . 
  you do n't know anything to compare the eu against , which is why you cry like a teenager during puberty . 
   eu is free to continue treating european workers like dogs wow , talk about complaining on a high comfort level . 
  yeah , you know , actually seeing how people at other countries are treated should be the fucking standard , because nowhere else than in the eu are `` workers '' treated so damn fucking good . 
  you should visit russia some time and see how getting fucked looks like . 
  yeah , us and our laughable army consisting of 175.000 people . 
  meanwhile , the russians have 770.000 active personnel , and a deep motivation of `` saving europe '' . 
  not to mention the real fears of a president trump . 
  this putin puppet and his disdain for nato , together with the uk running an isolationist course and france having the threat of a president le pen means that the countries with nukes and a security council seat are completely out of the way . 
  thus leaving only the non-nuclear military forces of the rest of the eu to be a conventional threat against russia . 
  it really sucks to live with the threat of a trump being elected . 
  when that happens , you can say good bye to the baltics , the eu and most likely a free and democratic europe . 
  they do n't bite the hand that feeds them , they rather suckle gently ... 
  that 's a pretty long video and also in a language not many people on this sub can speak . 
  mind to give us some highlights ( maybe with timestamps ) ? 
  does this video show that the people were able to vote undisturbed in the end ? 
  my 3 step program to a better economy in ukraine : * remove russia * get european union association agreement * do n't elect dickheads ta-dah !, 
  now give me nobel prize in economics , pls . 
   poor russia , others always bully, 
  yes , exactly :  in a poll held by kyiv international institute of sociology in may 2009 in ukraine , ** 96 % of respondents were positive about russians as an ethnic group , 93 % respected the russian federation and 76 % respected the russian establishment . 
  ** now compare it with [ 2015 , when 72 % of ukrainians saw russa as unfavorable ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2015/08/russia-image-081.png ) . 
  the only one to blame for anti russian sentiments is russia . 
  the cause for an anti-russian sentiment in ukraine is putin and his russia . 
  and only one of those regimes survived into our times . 
  ooooohh , are we going to a theme park ? 
  weird , i 'd say the lunatics are in charge of running russia .
