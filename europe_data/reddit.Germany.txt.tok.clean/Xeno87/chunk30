  ok , then compare the deaths and displaced people from russias wars in chechnya , georgia , ukraine , syria , dagestan with those from nato 's involvement in lybia , kosovo and afghanistan . 
  the refugee crisis we had ? 
  most of them were fleeing syria because of russia and assad . 
  ca n't remember having such a crisis after afghanistan . . * edit * : and then again , we are discussed european security here . 
  russia warmongering in europe somehow is different than regime changes in the middle east , where the entire region is already instable und uncomparable to europe . 
  russia is warmongering in our sphere of influence and in our countries , we are not . 
  yes , because involvement in regime changes ( which russia also does just as frequently as western contries ) is several orders of magnitude smaller in warmongering than actual border extension . 
  that 's like justyfing bombing your neighbors garden because he threw firework on christmas eve . 
  yeah it 's funny putin shills come up with `` it 's laughable '' when everything russia recently did was checking off stuff on that list . 
  tell that to putin that duqin is mental , because ha apparently thinks otherwise . 
  but i 'm talking about extending its borders . 
  the only country that did so recently was russia . 
  several times already btw . 
  ah , i see you are cycling through your alt-accounts again ? 
  ca n't name any western country that has extended its border recently . 
   munich dammit , this is just comic . 
  we 're at exactly the same spot where we were 80 years ago . 
  yeah but then again , putin is following [ his handbook ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) very precisely , and one of the not yet accomplished points says :  finland should be absorbed into russia . 
  southern finland will be combined with the republic of karelia and northern finland will be `` donated to murmansk oblast '' . 
  stop it with the downvotes , / u/emperordragnea was obviously sarastic . 
  not only is it obvious from his writing style , but also from his comment history :  [ i swear when i see people from the western block praise russia i want to put them in one of the warsaw pact countries for one day and understand how cool it is to be friend of russia ... ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ulmrg/a_turkish_military_patrol_boat_fired_shots_early/ddvl09e/ ), 
  russia wants war , russia needs war . 
  we must get rid of putin and his regime if we ever want to have peace in europe again . 
  if you have a link ending with a right parenthesis , you must include a \\ in front of the parenthesis or else reddit formatting will interpret it as the end of the link . 
  so do [ link with correct parenthesis ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/moomin_ ( 1990_tv_series \\ ) ) to get [ link with correct parenthesis ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/moomin_ ( 1990_tv_series \\ ) ), 
  oh , you are saying that a russian false flag operation sounds more plausible than refugees without any money aquiring hand grenades in a foreign country without having any contact ? 
  yeah , me too . 
  interesting that you consider `` hurr it 's all refugees 'n mudslimes '' - posts more trustworthy than the possibility of a russian false flag operation that chronologically coincides with russias actions . 
  you know , maybe i 'd stop coming up with theories about shit russia might be doing if russia stopped doing so much shit . 
  yeah , they do , but it 's tricky :  [ the european parliament is finalising legislation which will allow eu residents to access their paid subscriptions for online media -- such as video streaming , games and music -- whilst visiting other eu countries . 
  ] ( https://thestack.com/cloud/2017/02/08/eu-prepares-easing-of-netflix-geoblocking/ ) so , it 's saying `` paid subscriptions '' , meanign that in our case here , where the video is free , the rule does not apply . 
  and while my first thought when reading this was `` awesome , more netflix content '' , it does not mean that i can view ( netflix ) content of other countries - i only can access the content of my country in other countries . 
  netflix could do this for example by binding my account to my billing address in germany , thus offering me the german content when i 'm in france - but not the french content . 
  but it 's a step in the right direction and rome was n't built in a day . 
  again , if they are discussing how to fight in ukrainian cities _ on state owned tv _ , it means they have the desire to do so . 
  i do n't care about `` they would have '' - there are thousands of reasons they did n't go full invasion in ukraine , one of them being russia being dirt poor and having such a shitty military that they ca n't even take on ukraine . 
  can also be russian false flag to start unrest . 
  it started and grew right when russia began to go apeshit on everyone . 
  i think they mistranslated that , it 's `` russian soldiers '' , not `` rebels '' . 
  both start with `` r '' and end with `` s '' though , so it 's an easy mistake . 
  it 's not about benefit , it 's about ideology : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics  ukraine should be annexed by russia because '' `` ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning , no particular cultural import or universal significance , no geographic uniqueness , no ethnic exclusiveness , its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible . 
  seeing how there are actual discussions in russia state tv how to fight and win in ukrainian cities , i 'm damn sure russia will continue to undo the `` mistake of 1991 '' . 
  [ can you watch it on dailymotion ? 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x21r3ik_es-war-einmal-der-mensch-e01-eine-neue-welt-entsteht_shortfilms ) also , we need the eu to do ( even ) more about geoblocking . 
  well , i 'd say the dvd is awesome no matter what , but there are differences : the czechian dvd has better image quality then the german one . 
  apparently , the german dvd consists of the same material that was aired on tv , so it 's a bit lesser quality . 
  still worth it though . 
  so , how about we just go full on trade embargo against russia , ban them from swift , and do some extreme vetting on pople associated with russia and putin until russia stops doing this shit ? 
   so i just prefer an otherwise reliable zealot as a lesser evil , i guess . 
  those `` lesser evils '' have supported trump , they are just as evil as him . 
  impeach trump , lock up all his associates and scheudle another election . 
  wo n't happen of course , but that 's what has to be done - republicans do n't deserve this presidency . 
  watching it as an adult ( i own the dvd ) , i 'm super impressed by the utopic future envisioned there . 
  not only is it utopic ( duh ) , but the way they managed to imagine an utopic world that can be utopic from both viewpoints , of communism and capitalism , was just genius . 
  you did n't see `` propaganda '' from either side . 
  and then , the humor - just awesome . 
  and , just as you said , the scifi concepts were on point . 
  seeing the `` il \u00e9tait une fois l'homme '' - intro , i feel sorry for french kids . 
  [ the german intro is so much more awesome ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vrt0_eu7qq ) , i still ca n't listen to it without tears rolling down my face when the rocket starts . 
   expedition adam 84 ( die besucher/the visitors ) nostaglia boner . 
  damn that music , that story . 
  this series is just awesome story telling , and if you were to do a remake , it would have the potential to become a big hit . 
  dayum this was a nice series . 
  #lock . her.up . 
   you should start interning anyone who votes for right wing parties ( or just anyone who is n't a leftist ) as russian agents . 
  i 'm glad rightists like you are ok with that . 
  because that 's what i 'm gon na do then , if you ask for that so nicely ... 
  the [ trolls from olgino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trolls_from_olgino ) are the russian internet brigade . 
  because dead people ca n't prove their innocence . 
  so , when do we treat shit like this as acts of war ? 
  0 points , 50 % upvotes . 
  olgino working overtime today . 
  no i 'm referring to lepen , putin , wilders & co , but thanks for standing up for diversity and actual self determination of the people ( and not the theatre we saw in crimea or eastern ukraine ), 
  the federal president is elected by a committee ( the [ federal convention ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_convention_ ( germany \\ ) ) ) not only consisting of politicans , but of people that are send there in the name of the parties to vote . 
  those people can be artists , stars , professors , intellectuals ... one of them happened to be the artist olivia jones . 
  well i 'd say ignoring the osce regulations and doing unannounced exercises with more than 10.000 soldiers ( even 100.000 ) is more of a provocation than 20 guys . 
  it 's fucking awesome !, 
  but it 's a damn shame that the idiots wanting to change european borders again are on the rise . 
  is your attention span too short for the entire sentence ? 
   there is more evidence for ** trump being a russian puppet ** than clinton being a goldmann-sachs puppet , ** but still he does not attack trump ** the fact that snowden attacked only clinton during the campaign and ** never ** mentioned trumps russia/putin conenction is the best proof that snowden supports trump _ and _ putin . 
  but oh well , reddit account created during trumps election campaign ? 
  what a coincidence that you wo n't admit that ... 
  have you ever read my comment ? 
   # ** during the campaing ** great , he plays theatre after the election is over . 
  wow , it 's almost as if people are stupid enough to fall for that . 
   to debate some imbecil . 
  see , that 's an insult snowden should 've used . 
  feel free to do that , in the mean time , i wo n't have any of your shit . 
  yeah , you know if you wanted to win this debate you could 've just posted one of snowdens tweets were he attacks trump as hard as clinton or harder during the election . 
  at least i can see that snowden never spoke out against trump as he did vehemently against clinton during the elctions . 
  but what do i expect from debating with a redditor for 4 months that only posts anti-us stuff ? 
  no , he should be extradited and face prosecution for breaking the law . 
  you know , what normally happens when someone breaks it . 
   donald trump being bad goes without saying wait , so everytime putin , spicer , conway or any other republican says `` donald trump '' , they are criticizing him ? 
  woah ... 
  he never criticizes trump . 
  speaking out against him = opposing him . 
  speaking out _ only _ against someones enemies = supporting him . 
  it 's the latter that he does .
