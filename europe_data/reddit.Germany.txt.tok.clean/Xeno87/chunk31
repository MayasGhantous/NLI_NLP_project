  [ here , more than 200 instances of russia being accused of lying . 
  ] ( http://www.russialies.com/ ), 
  ah you know , just check www.russialies.com for all the shit russia was accused of making up and actually did . 
  you got one instance ? 
  i got 240 . 
  that 's 0.004 and i 'd say it 's < < 1, 
  implying that a political candidate is compeltely controlled by a bank is a clear aggression , yes . 
  and if you say stuff like that , you should be able to prove it with extraordinary evidence . 
   i think you 're just projecting your own biases onto his tweet . 
  i 'm coming from the fact that he never attacked trump . 
  like never . 
  you know the most aggressive thing he said about trump ? 
   [ who would have imagined donald trump 's greatest fear was an economic debate ? 
  ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/snowden/status/736598960756948992?lang=en ) that 's it . 
  compare that to implying that hillary clinton is completely controlled by goldmann sachs . 
  [ or that she broke classification rules for personal benefit ] ( https://twitter.com/snowden/status/738014840543797249?lang=de ) ( sidenote : no , she did n't ) . 
  if he thinks donals trump is so bad , or that he is a russian puppet , or that he is owned by wall street , why does he never say that ? 
  wow , such vile attack . 
  wow . 
  i 'm blown away by this insane aggression . 
  '' / u/richardsaunders greatest fear is an economic debate . '', 
  wow i hope i do n't get banned for such insults . 
  it 's like there is a statistical chance < < 1 of russia not being bad in a single case . 
  wow . 
  that 's not a `` middle '' , that 's infinitesimally . 
  except no he has n't . 
  he only ever downplayed trumps power as president . 
  [ or why does `` snowden attacking trump not yield any results in that regard ? 
  i 'm basing my viewpoint on him never speaking out against trump and only against clinton . 
  nothing to misinterpret there . 
   or maybe he disliked both and noted how absurd and shitty the choices were in his opinion ? 
  weird how he does n't say that . 
  weird that he somehow never attacked trump during the election . 
  weird that he only always downplayed trumps power as president . 
  huh , it 's almost as if he doesnt oppose him at all . 
  oh my god , this changes everything !, 
  russia is the most innocent country in the world !, 
  it never did anything wrong !!, 
   and option b is a politician bought by corrupt oligarchs . 
  well then maybe he should have stated that , but he did n't . 
  the fact stands , if you talk about two persons and only insult one person , you are taking sides . 
  and seeing how snowden not only downplays trump all the time but is also best friends with his best friend putin , i 'd say i do n't buy the theatre about executions . 
   socialist that 's quite an insult on / r/europe , i must say . 
  [ nah , russia is doing all the confirmation for me . 
  demeaning clinton means he opposes trump . 
  got it . 
  alt-comprehension in a nutshell . 
  it 's not fake news , it 's propaganda , and it 's also not a hybrid war but a war . 
  found the pee pee shill, 
  as i said above : demeaning clinton but not trump is not supporting trump ? 
  he clearly chose sides . 
  maybe you should read that sentence again . 
  demeaning clinton but not trump is not supporting trump ? 
  so where is he demeaning trump ? 
  actually , i disagree . 
  [ by supporting a literal fascist ] ( http://smoloko.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2016-03-01_at_12.29.15_pm.jpg ) he has proven all his accusers right when they said that he never cared about transparency or democracy at all and just about hurting the us/strengthening its enemies . 
  * edit * : he never attacked trump _ once _ during the campaing . 
  he only ever attacked clinton . 
  do n't tell me he does n't support trump . 
  there is more evidence for trump being a russian puppet than clinton being a goldmann-sachs puppet , but still he does not attack trump . 
  weird . 
  [ trump ] ( http://smoloko.com/wp-content/uploads/screenshot_2016-03-01_at_12.29.15_pm.jpg ) . 
  yeah well that may be because everything russia was accused of in the recent years later turned out to be true . 
  guess why there 's even a sub called / r/russiadenies ? 
   if they would have been reduced to a smoldering crater by russia . 
  and russia into a smoldering crater by ukraine . 
  that 's how mutual assured destruction works , you know . 
  but ok , let 's be realistic , let ' s give ukraine the world 's third largest pile of nukes and see if those tourists piss off or not . 
  lol , eu ca n't even agree on curved bananas and now we unanimously have started ww3 ... by doing what , annexing crimea ? 
  but if you say that we started ww3 , we should bring it to russia , it would only be fair . 
  sure , and soviet people were also maniupulated by state propaganda , still they knew what was right and what was wrong . 
  russians today know that attacking and annexing georgia , ukraine or checnya is wrong . 
  they know that there are no crucifications of babies and no fascists . 
  they know damn well what is bullshit and what not , the only difference is that they are fine with it . 
  thanks to fucking russia , no country will ever again [ give up on nuclear weapons . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) fuck this country , and fuck those 80 % people supporting that wannabe hitler in moscow,

  olgino bots at work again . 
  america is not involved . 
  wait , so you were n't making a single point and just randomly said `` farage is irrelevant '' in complete disregard of the context here ? 
  and who were the eu politicians talking about punishment ? 
  were those relevant politicians ? 
  can you give us a few quotes ? 
  because i only remember boris johnson or farage calling hard negotiations a `` punishment '' . 
  iirc , the top eu politicians just said that there will be no easy negotiations or special treatment . 
  but how would she make france a russian vichy regime then ? 
  i do n't remember where this is from , but someone recently said a modern dictatorship is not so much about persecuting the innocent , but sparing the guilty . 
  i always have to think about this recently ... 
  [ always remember why fascists lie . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eknfee5.jpg ) it 's not to state facts , it 's a declaration of intent . 
  it 's what has to be true to justify what comes next . 
  [ or when the entire opposition is getting poisoned or drinks polonium tea . 
  ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-opposition-activist-vladimir-kara-murza-poisoned-hospitalized/ ), 
  `` oh hey , so there 's a fascist reigning in the us now additionally to the fascist in moscow , and ironically , he also wants to employ his propaganda machine ( breitbart ) to destroy european liberal democracies and turn them into fascist shitholes , but we should n't discuss this here '', 
  roughly in the last 63 years ? 
  they already were n't mighty anymore in 1961 when they completely botched bay of pigs invasion , they lost more and more powers after watergate and the iran-contra scandal , they lost more power during the 2000 's after they lied to congress about torture and stuff which led to a few bills , changes and investigations . 
   1954 that was 63 years ago.that 's like saying germany 's military is powerful enough to conquer the entire european continent and major parts of the european sector of russia because they did in in 1941 . 
  i 'm talking about recent history , not ancient rome . 
  seems like you should rather read this as it pretty much proves my point . 
  nah , that was the fsb,
