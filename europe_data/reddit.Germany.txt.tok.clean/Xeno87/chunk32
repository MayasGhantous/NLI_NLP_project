  [ and he was n't the only one ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/30/exclusive-photographs-expose-russian-trained-killers-in-kiev.html ) . 
   these last four years it 's not just the sbu that had very close ties to moscow and russia 's fsb , a lot of the heads of our agencies were russian agents -- at the police , the ministry of defense and the prosecutor general 's department [ also see this reddit thread identifying russian airborne troops during maidan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/2fclfd/russian_airborne_soldiers_were_on_kiev_maidan_in/ ), 
  [ inb4 antirussian propaganda ] ( http://ukraineatwar.blogspot.de/2014/09/berkut-officers-killing-on-maidan-were.html?m=1 ), 
  as many allies as russia has . 
  well , but sometimes they are not . 
  during maidan for example , those guys were russian soldiers in ukrainians uniform . 
  that 's like every group work project . 
  one guy does all the work , and there 's that one guy never showing up but claiming all the fame after the project for him . 
  that 's not the same at all . 
  the powers for a coup are already there , already ready to start and all the cia does is convincing them to start . 
  the cia does nothing for the coup . 
   ca n't the cia stage a coup to overthrow trump ? 
  that the cia is so mighty it can overthrow entire governments is just a meme . 
  a few times there were countries where the military or someone were already thinking about overthrowing , and then the only thing the cia did was fund the right people , make life for some others a bit harder and then the coup happened . 
  the cia is n't that allmighty organization everyone always says it is . 
   you got a lot of educated people left our country to work in your country it 's almost like educated people do n't like being ruled by xenophobic shitheads . 
  color me surprised !, 
  and now my country is paying huge loads of money for eastern european countries so that they can become rich , too . 
  the only other thing they have to do ist obey some simple , awesome rules that define a liberal democracy . 
  but since some of them do n't give a fuck about working rules and rather be xenophobic , we are wasting a good load of our money . 
   while i certainly think any country should welcome and help those in need , i do n't think the reason eastern-european countries are ` bad ' countries is because of immigration ( or denying immigrants ) . 
  actually , i do ( not `` bad '' , but inefficient/corrupt ) . 
  people that deny immigration are , and there is no other term , xenophobes . 
  this is _ always _ accompanied by a lack of moral and the unwillingness to obey rules . 
  but these are exactly the qualities that a good leader ( and government ) needs to have if he wants to change his country for the better . 
  and it is important , extremely important to note that taking in poor immigrants ( i 'm stressing poor because the europeans in america were also immigrants ) has [ always benefitted the host country . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umqvyhb3wf4&amp;t=11m ) that 's just how it is - taking in refugees and immigrants only has benefits . 
  however , human nature is also _ always _ scared about this ( do n't get me wrong , i understand why people do n't like immigrants - but it 's not justified ) . 
   i think that the iron curtain definitely played the biggest part in ensuring these countries are behind , communism did n't really help them and they 're effectively just now discovering democracy . 
  corruption is also a very big thing in all of these countries as we all know . 
  certainly , definitely !, 
  but do n't forget that this is why the eu member states pay money - to get those countries , that were enslaved for decades by russia , help to get onto the same level is the other , wealthier countries that were lucky to be more western . 
  but since the governments in most of those countries are often not liberal governments ( in the sense of `` liberal democracy '' ) , this money gets partially wasted by corruption . 
   anyway , i have seen it with my own two eyes and they were 85 % male . 
  [ xenophobes must make shit up or their heads explode ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a654pck.jpg )  also it is shameful that you help to fuck up your own country and you are proud of it . 
  yup , i heard that shit already in 1994 during [ the yugoslavia crisis ] ( https://refugere.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/refugees-and-displaced-people-from-the-former-yugoslavia-since-1991_0c5a.jpg ) . 
  well , my country somehow came out strong as fuck from that . 
  countries that did n't really take in refugees ( compared to their population ) remained shit . 
  you are fucking your country up , while i 'm doing my best that my country stays fucking strong . 
  [ the numbers of late 2016 match the numbers that are normal ] ( http://muenchner-fluechtlingsrat.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eurest-14-neu.jpg ), 
   i am just asking you , did you see them with your own eyes ? 
  only because i visited refugee homes . 
  which is funny , because germany toook in the major share of refugees , i 'm living in a city that took in a huge amount of refugees , and i still do n't see any except when _ i _ visit _ them _ . 
  but i have friends working with them , i visited refugee shelters , and i know the big picture . 
   but not , they are 85 % young troublemaker males . 
  no , well , you know , there are facts and figures that show the exact opposite , but since you are a xenophobe , you need to make shit up . 
  otherwise you could n't fuel your worldview anymore and have to admit that it 's shit . 
   stop pushing your agenda . 
  said the guy making shit up . 
  i have graphs , facts and figures , you have nothing . 
  no , i 'm a guy that hears the same shit since decades and also sees that the same arguments were made every damn year during the entirety of mankind . 
  obviously , germany will be overrun by frenchmen ( 1800-1900 ) , no jews ( 1920-45 ) , no wait now it 's italians ( 50 's ) , greeks ( 60 's ) , turks ( 70 's ) , russians ( early 90 's ) , yugoslavians ( mid 90 's ) , romanians ( 2009 ) , now ( 2014-2017 ) it 's refugees . 
  it 's all the same shit , people like you change the name every few years but in the end all you want is no foreigners at all . 
  funnily , countries that let people in are in good shape , countries that do n't let anyone in suck balls . 
  because nobody wants to live in a xenophobic shithole , and that is every country where pople like you have the power . 
   more than 300.000 [ stopl lying ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/pressemitteilungen/de/2017/01/asylantraege-2016.html ) [ and that 's because of the early year 2016 . 
  ] ( https://www.bundesregierung.de/content/de/statischeseiten/breg/fluechtlings-und-asylpolitik/bilder/2016-08-22-fluechtlingszahlen-stand-juli16.jpg?__blob=poster&amp;v=3 ) it 's been going down , and just like during the yugoslavia crisis , it 's ending . 
  you know , it 's funny to see how all those countries wanting to keep migrants out are just much more shit than those who do n't want to do that . 
   focus your own country and your migrants . 
  what migrants ? 
  virtually nobody comes here anymore . 
  well , and maybe we would , if orban was n't flirting with putin and using everything he can to dismantle the eu down to an economic tool . 
  if you do n't like the eu , leave . 
   let me drop just one single sentence without explanation to pretend to contribute to the discussion, 
  i 've always asked myself : what if france had invaded nazi germany after hitler ended democracy and proclaimed himself [ f\u00fchrer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_referendum,_1934 ) . 
  i mean , the entire ww2 would 've been prevented , but when is a nation justified in invading another country ? 
  only 5 years later , france was invaded by germany , so in 1934 , if france had acted , they would have prevented their own demise . 
  so , if someone was to ask me `` when is germany or france allowed to invade poland/romania/hungary to restore democracy '' , what should i answer ? 
  only after everything has gone down the shitter and those countries have attacked others , or already before that ? 
  i know that knowing the bad things is of higher importance than the good stuff if you want to make an opinion . 
  but you still may want to see [ his reaction to a greek right-wing ( golden dawn ) politician making racist remarks about turks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv_5v32apkk ) ( subtitles should be available , his statement is in german ) . 
  no shit , i saw several facebook ( and g + , but who cares about that ) posts that said `` thanks merkel for the cultural enchrichment '' to that . 
  [ false flag like literally any shelling ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/proof-that-russia-shelled-ukrainian-troops-and-took-control-of-the-rebel-held-border-2015-2?ir=t ), 
  the us never declared war on vietnam . 
  [ actually , the us has not declared war at all since ww2 . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/undeclared_war ) . 
  guess everything after '45 was n't war , then . 
   we ca n't take the whimsical ideals of every nation into mind when making policy that is designed to focus on america , first and foremost . 
  that 's a weird reply if you are reminded about your own ideals . 
  yeah , no . 
  we can talk about that when putin is in front of the tribunal . 
  well but have you considered that maybe the uk is n't the only one that soon has to make trade deals ? 
  what if the us , the uk and russia did everything they possibly could to destroy the eu , by schr\u00f6derising all of our politicians or straight out financing our extremist , anti-eu parties to the max ? 
  what if in a mere 5 years , the eu collapses due to the sheer pressure from those three countries and then the uk already has trade deals with other nations , while the 27 former eu members have none . 
  have you ever considered the possibility that they take a cut for a few years just to be the winner in the long run ? 
  imagine the tantrum russians and their vassalls on the internet threw when american politicians dare to visit ukraine . 
  imagine the sheer `` reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee '' if nato was to give serbia military equipment . 
  if you want to make the eu better , you must get rid of putin , there is no other way . 
   even as foreign development aid in the source countries of refugees and migrants for example . 
  that 's what 1/3 of this sum was used for . 
  reading the article helps . 
  but it really is n't . 
  we did n't have any refugees in the 20 years since the last crisis ( 1994-1996 ) , so this is basically what we saved for a future crisis . 
  then again , this money goes right back into the economy , making it a huge stimulus package . 
  and seeing how much we pay for the new berlin airport ( ~ 7 bn ) , this really is neither much , nor unexpected or expensive . 
  also , 7bn went straight into humanitarian aid . 
  i 'm one of the people who blame everything the russians do on the russians . 
  they did annex and invade parts of several countries . 
  at some point we have to admit a gun in putins hands is a fitting picture these days . 
  i think / u/mimunto does n't deny the fact that russia has an online army , but that it is in fact an army , not a small task force . 
  we should target their dictator , not the theater they call `` elections '',
