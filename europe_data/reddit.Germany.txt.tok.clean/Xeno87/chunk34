   not really , it does n't take that much more fuel to get from mars to earth [ here 's the delta v map for mars and the moon ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/delta-vs_for_inner_solar_system.svg ) . 
  you need 10,2 km/s \u0394v from mars ground to earth leo , wheareas you only need 6,4 \u0394v km/s from moon ground to earth leo . 
   plus you can make the fuel out of the martian atmosphere , ca n't do that on the moon . 
  you can make methane and o2 for fuel from the moons ice just as you can do it on mars . 
  and now we did n't even talk about the travel time of 3 days from moon compared to several months from mars . 
  seeing how russia already struggles in syria , even when using ground troops , against rebels and isis who do n't even have an airforce or actual tank batallions , i 'm fairly confident . 
  do n't forget that russia has an economy the size of italy , they were n't able to actually modernize their military in the last 30 years . 
  there are some new systems being paraded around every year in moscow , but they are n't used in combat and also not introduced to the army in a real extent . 
  the only thing russia has is a huge number of reservists , but when their equipment is 30-40 year old , they are n't an actual enemy against nato , more like a zerg rush . 
   on a more serious note , call what you want . 
  i know what i saw with my own eyes and heard from people whom i trust on this matter . 
  i wo n't take the word from an internet stranger on reddit in this case . 
  i require verifiable proof from neutral observers . 
  well , too bad that russia did n't let those observers to their proper job , which means that i _ must _ call bullshit . 
  i can trust others , but those must be trustworthy . 
  you , and russia , are not . 
   are you implying that those are weapons of some sort ? 
  i 'm implying those trucks were mostly empty . 
  [ i call bullshit ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/content/2014/0815-odu-ukraine-trucks/18856267-1-eng-us/0815-odu-ukraine-trucks_full_600.jpg ), 
   russia starting the georgia war for example totally not gleiwitz, 
  ahh snap : /, 
  no , because actually correct secession by a lawful vote . 
  stop it with your russophobia !, 
  those are humanitarian convoys !, 
   the more of a russian puppet she shows herself to be , the fewer chances she 'll have at winning the presidency . 
  i only remember when [ he threatened to take it back in 2008 ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/nato-got-nothing-from-conceding-to-russia-in-the-past-why-should-it-cave-to-the-kremlin-in-2016/ ) . 
  crimea is still ukrainian . 
  that 's the distinction between [ ownership ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ownership ) and [ possession ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/possession_ ( law \\ ) ) . 
  crimea is ukrainian property , russia possesses it unlawfully . 
  and do n't you even dare thinking about leaving . 
  we need you to demand english as a working language in the eu . 
  this is implausible beacuse we had the same shit in 1994-1996 with yugoslavian refugees when the party `` die republikaner '' was rising because of the very same shit . 
  but they never got to 15 % and seeing that unemployment is as low as 1991 , gdp and incomes are rising , this is not explainable by `` those foreigners want to steal errrr jerbs '' . 
  it is however explainable with `` russia is funding the shit out of every nazi party and trying to bring back fascism '' . 
  [ surely not ] ( http://m.imgur.com/stlfa0k ) the nazis did n't start with `` gas the jews '' , that only came in 1941 , 8 years after they took power and 2 years in ww2 . 
  they started exactly , literally , with the same shit as the afd, 
  great , a berlusconi boy . 
  a rubber-stamper . 
  do n't expect him to make a stand for europe like schulz did - in fact i can see him spooning trump . 
  well , would n't have had much impact anyways because the other nazi party afd is standing at 15 % . 
  it 's amazing , trump wants hostile relations with the biggest economy in the world . 
  the only one he wants good relations with is a shitty country with an economy smaller than italy 's . 
  sadly , yes . 
  terrifying to see that everything we achieved in more than 70 years can be corrupted and killed so easily . 
  that 's why they throw all resources they have left into propaganda and lobbying . 
  they want to buy our politicians and/or makes us vote for the ones they bought . 
  they want us to hand ourselves over . 
  yup , that 's what most of germans were doing , too . 
  still they marched into ww2 . 
  so you are saying leavers are clueless and without plans ? 
  huh , sounds about right . 
  maybe they should look for other jobs , i mean if you 're even underqualified for being politician ... 
   lalalala i ca n't hear you yup . 
  the vote itself caused chaos . 
  see all the racist attacks on poles . 
  well and how about we play my favorite game : [ spot the brexit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0ety9sal.jpg ) . 
  can you see when the pound/euro course suddenly crashed and _ never _ recovered from it ? 
  they were told that article 20 would be triggered the next day . 
  ca n't blame them for believing leavers . 
  nothing was changed , so there is no reason to expect grave differences . 
  is that so hard to understand ? 
  remove putin , fight every dictator , treat _ any _ non-democratic country as a threat and not a partner . 
   i do n't get how some people still believe that russia does n't have anything on him . 
  that 's how you do that . 
  we have to build it on the ruins of putins russia . 
  there is no other way . 
  putin must fall for a liberal , democratic , unified europe to exist . 
  this was n't even my intentio . 
  i wanted to state that what we are seeing in turkey ist only a matter of time until it happens here . 
  that we need to expect it if we even want to have chance to prevent it, 
  good . 
  we need to fight russian and american disinfo . 
  `` how dare you treat us like any other country ? 
  we want more special treatment like the ones we got when being part of the eu '', 
  well and here in germany we have afd denying climate change . 
  looking at all their `` proposals '' for education , it 's only a matter of time until they want to stop teaching about climate science . 
  this is plain and simple damage control . 
  be aware - this might be the first sign that russia , after having won the us election and achieved major goals in syria , turns to ukraine again . 
  you ca n't deny being a nazi if you want to use '' _ v\u00f6lkisch _ '' positively . 
   i 'm really tired of people using the term `` nazi '' for everything that is slightly more right than their own way of thinking . 
  and i 'm tired of thinking that nazi means `` gas the jews '' . 
  that 's not how the nazis were in the 20 's and 30 's . 
  they did n't run on killing all jews . 
  they did n't run on starting a world war . 
  they ran on exactly the same stuff afd is running today - populism , smug hate against refugees and foreigners ( yes , there were refugees back then - _ ostjuden _ ) , anti-liberalism , anti-intellectualism , anti-democracy . 
  it _ is _ all the same . 
  * edit * : [ here , that 's quite like it ] ( https://www.facebook.com/gegendiealternativefuerdeutschland/photos/a.414040782034323.1073741828.358546407583761/770200243085040/?type=3&amp;theater ), 
  this depends on how you ask questions . 
  if you ask people if they feel more unsafe after a terrorist attack , you most likely will get an answer that most feel just as safe as before because they know how statistically rare it is that you become a victim of a terrorist attack . 
  if you ask if people feel less safe than ~ 10 years ago , you will obviously get the `` everything was better in the past '' effect . 
  i promised myself that if my student loan back pay ( 2.800 $ ) would arrive before christmas , i would fly into holidays last minute , preferably canaries . 
  it came on 23.12 . , but then , every hotel was booked . 
  i could 've flown there easily , but would end up without a hotel room . 
  you could make a list of countries that did n't invade poland . 
   i sympathise , but we should n't be shocked when the soviets react . 
   soviets yup , that 's a freudian slip . 
  well if you want we can play a little game called [ spot the brexit ] ( http://imgur.com/0ety9sa ) . 
  can you spot the date when the pound suddenly lost value to the euro and never made it back up again ? 
  if only there was such a website . 
  goddammit , i came here a few years ago and this was a left leaning site ...
