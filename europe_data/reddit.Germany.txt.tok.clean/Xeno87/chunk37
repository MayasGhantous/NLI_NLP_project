  the same applies to mccain , whose spinless behaviour in regard to the vile attacks by his own president-elect did anihilate all credibility . 
  i believe it when i see action , mr. mccain . 
  until then , i do n't trust this guy who said that the baltics are just the outskirts of st. petersburg a fucking bit . 
   factssansfeels irrelevant username, 
  if you are surprised that there are n't dead bodies every week in europe , then i 'd assume you must be pretty scared about people wanting to kill other people . 
   we get no political , diplomatic or ecnomic benefit from being part of nato . 
  oh , there is a huge benefit from being part of nato : not being attacked by russia . 
  in case you ( intentionally ) forgot , [ during the bucharest nato summit in 2008 ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1584027/stay-away-vladimir-putin-tells-nato.html ) vladimir putin openly stated that `` regions of georgia or ukraine '' , like crimea , eastern ukraine or abkhasia would `` break away and join russia '' if ukraine and georiga were to join nato . 
  ** germany , france and the uk veto 'd georgia 's and ukraine 's nato application out of respect for russian concerns ** those two countries did n't get into nato , but both were attacked by the russians just a bit later . 
  so , no benefit , huh ? 
  lem me guess , you are living in russia ? 
   we are lucky most of the would-be 's are utter morons who keep getting caught . 
  or , you know , not everyone speaking a foreing language is out to kill you . 
  well , i actually never got _ that _ part since he is the only victim of that attack to be eligible for compensation by the german state . 
  the law for this explicitly rules out compensation if the attack was done with a truck , which is why all other victims legally do n't have the right for compensation . 
  ( before you get outraged : our government already anounced that germany will still pay those compensations voluntarily and that the law most likely will be changed ) i see all this just as a pr stunt , started by polish nationalists , to promote `` poland stronk '' thinking . 
  it 's good if his family gets the money , but i 'd rather had seen it if the coverage was not only focussed on him , but all victims and their families . 
  a jammed wheel ( after hitting something ) can easily be responsible for this . 
  but all this is up to the police to investigate , it will take a while until they can ( and will ) say something about this . 
  even if he pissed himself and begged for mercy , it would n't change anything . 
  that guy deserves respect and condolence . 
   reddit keeps telling me that these people are all peaceful muslims . 
  / r/thathappened show us those comments please . 
  show us who is saying that he/she considers ** all ** of them peaceful . 
  and that better be a huge load of comments , not just one single deluded guy because , you know , you said `` reddit '' is telling you this . 
  and then also show us how many terrorist attacks or murders were commited by refugees taking in after 2014 and how many we took in during that time . 
   it 's like a guest misbehaving in your home to see if they are `` guests '' or not depends not on their heritage or place of birth , but their passport . 
  so far , i did n't see any definite statements on their legal status . 
  yes , nobody needs to know . 
   the seven suspects , who are all aged between 15 and 21 we have very strict laws and ethics code concerning reports about juvenile culprits . 
  also , the mere ancestry does have nothing to do with the legal status of these kids . 
  but what is even much more important : setting a homeless person on fire does n't get worse by being a foreigner . 
  do you even know why [ justitita ] ( https://www.proasyl.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/justitia.gif ) wears a blindfold ? 
  and in nazi germany , there were the [ frankfurter zeitung ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurter_zeitung ) and the [ berliner tageblatt ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_tageblatt#gleichschaltung_und_schlie.c3.9fung ) , the former was published until 4 years into ww2 , the latter published until the beginning of ww2 . 
  the mere existence of a press that can publish opposition pieces is not the same as `` free press '' , not even close . 
  russia is ranked [ 148th out of 179 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_freedom_in_russia ) by reporters without borders and 83 from 100 by freedom house . 
  talk about free press once it 's in the upper half . 
  i think he 's saying that the_dipshit mainly consists of russians . 
  i would agree . 
   we have opposition and free press if there is an explicit list for [ journalists killed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia ) in wikipedia and your country is the third-deadliest country for journalists , then stating that there is a a free press ist just not believable . 
  the same applies to having an opposition , when opposition leaders are assassinated with polonium or shot in plain sight . 
  russia has not only potemkin villages , but also potemkin oppositions and press . 
  [ terorism ** is ** a fact of life . 
  ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/thumbs/1300x1300r/2016-07/we-terrorism-1970-2015final.png ) that 's just how it is . 
  stop pretending it never was . 
  * edit * : ah , the hypocrisy . 
  * left wing terrorism : it 's because the soviet union was funding it * islamist terorism : it 's because muslims are fundamentally evil and also there totally never were any muslims in western europe pre 2001 . 
  additionally , the war on terror has of course no impact whatsoever , it 's just that muslims are bad and multiculturalism too . 
  aaaand here is the russian poking . 
  they are checking how far they can go . 
  hey is n't losing the war , in fact , he just won an all deciding battle when choosing the next us president . 
  the new exxon mobile secretary of state will make sure that russia will get a shitload of money . 
   eu28  this study presents one scenario for a 100 % renewable energy system in europe by the year 2050 . 
  should we tell them ? 
  it was the same in german comment sections in end of 2013 and 2014 , as well as during the big heights of the refugee crisis and especially during the new years eve stuff . 
  also , whenever there is something about turkey , the comments are all anti-erdogan , anti-authoritarian , but as soon as an article is about russia or putin , all are suddenly sucking authoritarian dick . 
  i am totally convinced that if we would cut russia from the internet , our discussions would suddenly become much more civil . 
  just like russia . 
  population of 100 million , biggest landmass and resources but an economy the size of spain . 
  and instead of improving the living conditions there , who cares , just fund nazi parties in europe , annex countries and destroy every hope of peace on this continent . 
  well , i say the same about putin 's speeches and his parties ' goals . 
  exactly , lithuania !, 
  who else remembers how kaczy\u0144ski and his pis spread fear about lithuanians coming to poland to claim back land that used to belong to lithuania before ww2 ? 
  how he agressively empowered racial tension against lithuanians ? 
  we changed , i swear !, 
  now , let 's discuss our strategy to once and for all defeat russia : we attack it ... wait for it ... ** in summer ** !, 
  thanks for correcting me !, 
  that 's actually intentional , i also write `` putin '' . 
  i chose two write them both with a small letter to symbolize their weakness and insignificance . 
  ( yes , i know how that sounds ), 
  on top of that , german newspaper comment sections are targeted by russian propaganda since at least 2013 , our parliament got hacked repeatedly by russia and our extremist parties are being funded by them . 
  it 's pretty damn hard to change the course against russia , it is even damn hard to maintain the course we have now . 
  do n't tell that to me , i advocate a much , much harder stance on russia since 2009 and called for a ban from swift in 2014 already . 
   extending british training of ukrainian armed forces sends a clear message that we support ukraine and remain firmly committed to its sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity , in the face of a more belligerent russia . 
  just like every bully , putin does not care about those half-assed things . 
  he sees them and laughs , as this is further confirmation that he has still not reached a red line and can continue to escalate the situation once he has kept his feet still for a short while and other governments have acclimated to the new normal . 
  putin only sees and takes seriously raw power , nothing else . 
  i agree that he might not hate people from such big countries like hungary or slovakia , but there 's this neighboring country with small population and laughably tiny economy that he does not like very much . 
  ah yes , the russian ability to know everything shows again . 
  of course you know my complete education background and therefore can tell me what i do n't know . 
  bravo , mr. mindreader . 
   putin and his administration is indeed an oligarchy , and it is somewhat imperialistic , but it is not fascist . 
  his regime is completely analogous to musslolini 's fascist system and even the hitler regime in 1939 . 
  oh , i know pretty damn well what i am talking about . 
  i 'd take the ussr over putins fascist state any time . 
  and if you do n't wan na get fucked , do n't attack our trading partners , stop violating our treaties , get your money out of our nazis parties , stick your online propaganda up your butt and stop calling us `` gayrope '' . 
  if you corner us , we will move forward . 
  there 's not much difference between trying to kill someone by ambushing and trying to beat them to death or trying to kill them by building a bomb . 
  if you lack the confidence of fighting someone , a bomb or a gun seems to be the obvious solution . 
  also , i ca n't wait for the comments telling me how killing someone with a bomb is worse than killing someone by beating them to death . 
  the decision to kill someone just for their existence is the radical part , not the means . 
  exactly . 
  it seems to me that a lot of redditors do n't know about the problems parents face with radicalized children . 
  yeah . 
  we should 've already banned russia from swift when they annexed parts of georgia after putin threatened to attack georgia and ukraine during the 2008 nato summit . 
  we should have gone full embargo , full internet hacks and special ops a long time ago . 
  and morally , never . 
  putin is ok with fillon , so i do n't think we will see the french election being bombarded with hacks and online propaganda like the us election . 
  the german election however ... 
  my parents did n't notice the extent of my radicalization .
