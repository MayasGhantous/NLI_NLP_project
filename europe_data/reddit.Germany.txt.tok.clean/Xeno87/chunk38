   not taking into account that it would have ended if not russia supporting assad . 
  no barrel bombs , no chemical attacks , no bombed hospitals , a now fly zone - the regime would have crumbled . 
   for all we know , the parents might have been very proud of their little martyr who would have brought great honor to the family . 
  german officials probably wo n't release information about the kid and his family since the accused is so , _ so _ young ( for criminal juveniles there are very strict rules ) . 
  even though there is the possibility that he comes from a a deeply religious family , it is also possible that his parents are just ordinary religious people ( or even non-religious or whatever ) . 
  he would n't be the first twelve year old to disagree with his parents after all . 
  the fact that the police says an unkown is member instructed him and not his family might be a hint that his family has no direct involvement in his radicalization . 
  russia itself excluded all alternatives to that do n't end in war by starting a goddamn war . 
  russia does n't deserve to save its face anymore . 
  it funds nazi parties , it hacks and riggs our elections , it threatens our trading partners and refers to us as `` gayrope '' . 
  russia only understands hard actions , not treaties or negotiations . 
  we complied with this terrorist state in 2008 already when we refused to let georgia and ukraine into nato after putin threatened to attack those countries . 
  look how that worked out ? 
   that would be practically a war . 
  but attacking and annexing is not ? 
  i called for a complete ban of russia from swift in 2014 already . 
  but instead , we keep appeasing russia all the time , even when they are hacking and rigging the us election , the west does nothing . 
  it 's absurd . 
   i 'd be interested to see a comparison of birth rates for muslim and non-muslim europeans . 
  a few years ago when tilo sarrazzin released his book how germany allegedly destroys itself because of immigration , this statistic came up . 
  afaik , birth rates among migrants were higher than from the ordinary german population , but always converge to the same rate in the second and third generation . 
  * edit * : [ found a ( german ) sorce ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article8931910/migrantinnen-passen-sich-deutscher-geburtenrate-an.html ), 
   normal chechens did n't wanted independence i 'm always amazed by russian abilities to know what an entire population wants . 
  i think you mean nonexistent . 
  well , at least the number of foreign born population for germany needs some clarification . 
  it looks like this number ( 15 % ) is actually the [ part of population that is considered to have a migrant background ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#migrant_background_and_foreign_nationality ) . 
  the definition of that is quite different from being an immigrant :  the federal statistical office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the federal republic of germany after 1949 , plus all foreign nationals born in germany and ** all persons born in germany as german nationals with at least one parent who migrated to germany or was born in germany as a foreign national ** . 
  i 'm not quite sure if this number is quite accurate and comparable to the others . 
  and then you get this :  [ nothing racist about not wanting more people from a specific country coming to your country . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5hqzpg/dutch_populist_leader_wilders_rises_in_polls/db2d2hj/ )  god , germany is well and truly fucked if it 's filled with stupid people like you . 
   and you are committed to the destruction of your own country  having an opinion there are too many migrants in a country is fine and should n't be punished . 
  so commenters are not people ? 
  oh wait , where did wilders talk about criminals or violent creatures ? 
  yeah , so what ' the difference ? 
  you are ok with a guy saying stuff like that there are too many morroccans and he `` will take care of that '' , but then you post stuff like  [ the sub dislikes the english because the english are influential , right-wing and voted to leave the eu ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5bcvkn/nsfw_for_europhiles_europe_according_to_a/d9nlkfu/ ) you are one bigot , sensitive snowflake . 
  racism is totally ok as long as it does n't turn against you , and as soon as someone disagrees with your opinion , you are crying . 
  why are nationalists always so damn whiny , my god . 
  * edit : you remind me of [ this gem ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56dm1c/as_a_fellow_european_i_feel_im_no_longer_welcome/d8j0eq6/ ) . 
  article mentions no source to which \u00d6gmundur jonasson allegedly spoke . 
  this is weird , i queston if it is legit . 
  yeah , we clearly destabilized ukraine by sending too many [ tracking rainers ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/1353218521327781190.jpg ) . 
  it was the evil west all along !, 
  mh370 was false flag western operation !, 
  crimea was n't annexed by russians , it was driven to russia !, 
  you know , when you write [ 20 years in advance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) what you are planning to do and then even [ threaten it again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_bucharest_summit ) , then there is no need to discuss anything . 
  the west never did anything wrong regarding ukraine and it 's all russias fault , completely . 
  yes , pumping money into a country is violating its sovereignty . 
  obviously . 
  sending soldiers is not , obviously . 
  this makes perfect sense in the russian world . 
  ahh ... mental illness . 
  yeah you know , the difference is that in my country they can actually hold a referendum about this - and it is n't even rigged . 
   chechnya is a fucking russian region . 
  it is not . 
   but yes , the us pumped huge anmounts of money into ukraine . 
  how dare they !, 
  clearly , the only morally acceptable choice is to invade ukraine and annex them !, 
  putin and his crooks have successfully globalised fascism . 
  what 's their position on putin ? 
   it 's just the us getting the treatment is has been dealing out to the world for decades . 
  we 're talking about the current us government here . 
  did the obama government temper with russias elections ? 
  did the current german government do this ? 
  you know , _ unlike in russia _ , there is no `` the us '' for more than 8 years . 
  governments change , and you can not hold the current government accountable for what the last did . 
  well , but in russia , 17 years the same shit are normal ...  clinton and trump are very much the same thing , albeit with slightly different labels . 
  lol . 
  trolls are hilarious . 
  so you 're saying you have no evidence at all and are just using whataboutism to legitimate russia waging a war against the wets ? 
  ** [ tracking rainer ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/1353218521327781190.jpg ) ** russian hybrid warfare operators have demonstrated often enough that they are just illiterate . 
  the spelling errors actually make it even more legit . 
  nope , russia is waging a war against the west . 
  i just want us to hit back . 
  if russia does not want a war , they should just stop all online hacking and propaganda , pull out their troops from moldova , georgia , ukraine , chechnya and syria and send the putin regime to den haag . 
  then i 'm fine . 
  yeah , when again did the west hack the elections of russia ? 
  what would russias response be if the west did that ? 
  declare war ? 
  because that 's what nato should now do . 
  either our democracies are slowly getting taken over during the next years , or we fight back . 
  there is almost no alternative . 
  * edit * : of course , we could impeach everyone collaborating with the russian regime , cut off russia from swift and the internet , and destabilize its bordering regions by hybrid warfare . 
   nazism is bad the fact that you criticize this shows immediatly what a disgusting piece of bigot shit you are . 
  well , together with stuff like this :  [ junkies are scum ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/5hgtnx/hi_people_what_is_your_honest_opinion_on_drug/db0mayr/ ) there 's no need to explain why i am siding with russias actual victims and opposing the digusting terrorist state that tries to destroy my european union simply because it wants to dominate europe to a person like you . 
   please have a valid reason for it , not just a baseless hyperbole . 
  well state sponsored , secret service backed doping is a pretty valid reason to criticize . 
  just like invading neighboring countries because they want to trade with richer nations . 
  or setting up an insane online propaganda and hacking army . 
  or funding nazi parties in other countries . 
  pick one , and then just collapse please . 
  you would do this continent a big favor . 
  yeah , you know the difference between individual doping and a state sponsored , government backed , secret service assisted systematical doping ? 
  yeah , you know , but you do n't care because you need to deflect . 
  there 's an actual feeling of `` you ca n't criticize russia '' in western societies . 
  it 's as if you literally can not blame russia for anything because they lost the cold war and now are totally unfailable , everything else is fearmongering and red scare . 
  it 's disgusting . 
  about to ruin scotland ? 
   russia  french military forces this does n't mean anything when talking about nuclear weapons ( which france has ) . 
  does n't make it right . 
  no sorry , i do n't want to rely on `` oh surely someone will stop him '' .
