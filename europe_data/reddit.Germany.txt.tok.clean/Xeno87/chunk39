  i want europe to be prepared to fuck russia up if it crosses the borders to thee baltics . 
  when its shitty little green men appear on eu territory , russia should get fucked up by us hard . 
  well this still does not change a thing . 
  who cares about skewing , trump won and he is literally just a putin puppet . 
  united russia rules the us in january . 
  ok , so united russia had ein the us election , the uk has left the eu and soon , a putin puppet will govern france - that means there are no nuclear weapons anymore that prevent russia from invading the baltics . 
  and putins russia is trying its best do undo this . 
  it 's the preperation for the next region bordering russia to suddenly claim independence . 
  how about you tell us where you come from and we tell you why you are despicable simply because of your heritage ? 
  * edit * : obviously , a trump fan . 
  who would 've thought , the kind of people that start sobbing when they get called racist , but condemn people solely of their heritage . 
  ca n't we just treat trumpists like they want to treat jews , muslims , roma ? 
  seems kinda fair to me . 
  which is n't exactly what happened when the us bombed that one hospital once . 
  after that , we had days of news and threads about this . 
  _ damn you , / r/europe for deleting my posts as soon as they reference rt _ [ check out this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/enoughtrumpspam/comments/4xdlpl/imagine_if_julian_assange_put_this_much_effort/d6ewbyx/ ) . 
  i think it 's a good time to repost the [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughtrumpspam/comments/4xdlpl/imagine_if_julian_assange_put_this_much_effort/d6ewbyx ) by / u/it _ could_happen_here :  remember back in 2010 , assange [ publicly announced he had a massive bombshell about putin , medvedev , and russian oligarchs ? ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2010/1026/wikileaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-russia.-but-will-russians-get-to-read-about-it ) . 
  then he met with russian officials , dropped the story , and refused to mention it again . 
  [ now he hosts a show on rt ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/rt-assange-show-wikileaks-125/ ) ( russia today , the kremlin 's english-language propaganda arm ) , where he regularly pushes right-wing russian talking points . 
  in one [ particularly brutal piece ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/julian-assange-rafael-correa-ecuador-769/ ) , he praises ecuador 's government for crushing freedom of the press and attempting to nationalize all journalism ( render all of ecuador 's media state-controlled ) , because `` the bankers own the ecuadorian papers and they 're bad for ecuador . '', 
   additionally , he [ regularly praises bashar al-assad ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/assange-hezbollah-nasrallah-syria-263/ ) , using talking points identical to those used by the stein-baraka green party ticket . 
  icymi , jill stein has also praised putin [ and even dined with him at a dinner honoring russia today ] ( https://twitter.com/zatchry/status/762055852991713280 ) . 
  at the same table as stein and putin , was michael flynn , donald trump 's military advisor . 
  now assange publishes article after article warning that `` imperialist media '' will try to `` smear '' jill stein . 
  nobody cared the hundreds of times when russia or assad bombed hostpitals in syria , either . 
  apparently , there are n't _ any _ rules of war left anymore . 
  yeah , but wl in 2016 is as credible as isis claiming responsibility . 
  and now we wait for the totally not russian commenters saying how this is totally unfounded . 
  oh wait , they 're already here . 
  stop lying . 
  you are spreading the bullshit lie that pegida , afd , other nazis and interestingly every neo-nazi , `` alt-right '' or russian online news made up that there was a news blockage ( there was n't ) . 
  no , but i remember how fake news reported fake news without worrying that it might be fake news , thus spreading fake news about cologne , blowing it up to gigantic proportions instead of just doing actual research and investigative journalism . 
  cut of russia from the internet and global market and see how fake news disappear or online comments suddenly become much , much more civil . 
  yeah i should n't have believed for a second that a russian nationalist could understand the difference between establishing a self-governing country and a full enslaving of a region . 
  lol, 
  ah , the good old `` whataboutism '' . 
  completely ignoring the fact that you do n't pay us or uk taxes in iraq as of today , unlike in parts of ukraine . 
  the difference between living in a country `` occupied '' by western democracies or a country occupied by russia is staggering . 
  how about this time we wait until the negotiations are finished and then use our 1 to 2 year period where our parliaments debate over it to see if it is actually like this or if this is simply a negotiation tactic to ask for the most early so you have more positions to give up during negotiations . 
  well right now i am pretty ok with not being allowed to marry guys ( on a legal basis equivalent to heterosexual marriage ) when i get political , economic stability and someone creates an opposition to those authoritarian dickheads , especially that dangerous fuck in the kremlin . 
   just like back then , people are going to settle down when it 's over . 
  this is what would happen if there was n't an entire country dedicated to funding our right-wing parties and spreading propaganda to promote racial tensions . 
  this time , it wo n't work out like this - while the suddenly rise of the republikaner , the right-wing party of the 90 's , basically vanished after the yoguslavian wars were over , the afd is here to stay . 
  also , there is no sign that the syrian war is going to end soon . 
  and dammit , we have a historic example . 
  germany invaded the rhineland and it was tolerated , germany anschluss 'd austria , it annexed the sudetenland , all because those were `` german majority regions '' . 
  everybody said `` no way germany would want anything more '' . 
  well , that 's why historians call the full annexion of czechoslovakia `` hitler 's demasking '' - before , he was seen as a smart strategist that always played his hand perfectly and even gave his obvious moves an ambiguous twist , so that no politician could get a hold of him . 
  after , he was finally seen as the greedy warmonger he was . 
  i 'm afraid we 're about to watch history repeat itself . 
  and during the yugoslavian wars , [ there was a refugee crisis just like the current one ] ( https://refugere.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/refugees-and-displaced-people-from-the-former-yugoslavia-since-1991_0c5a.jpg ) . 
  the same shit i have to read today about refugees , that they are all criminals , that we should deport them right back , that they deserve nothing , that we are stupid for taking them in , was said back then . 
  seriously , fuck people that oppose taking in refugees . 
  just fuck them , they do n't even know the slightest shit . 
  do n't let those fuckers fake compassion for the victims here in this thread , they do n't actually care . 
  yeah , and here things become even more complicated . 
  there is a self-sovereignity clause which germany used to voluntarily assume responsibility for processing asylum applications for which it is not otherwise responsible . 
  this is a weird mix of different laws and regulations , but basically , when the self-sovereignity clause of the dublin agreement is not activated , germany would transfer refugees that have not registered in the first country of arrival back to said country . 
  however , german law at least protects them from being prosecuted for crossing the border . 
  it seems that you have certain phobias of people . 
  you might want to consult a psychiatrist to overcome your fears and leave the lawmaking to those who have a cool head to decide . 
   ok , but in what way do you let an unregistered person enter and travel in the eu ? 
  there are no border controls in the schengen area , if someone managed to travel to germany already they will not have much problems to travel in the eu . 
  it 's about their rights as refugees . 
  the geneva convention only protects people from criminalization for corssing a border if they cross from the country they are fleeing from into the next one and register immediatly to seek asylum . 
  someone who traveled through a second country first does not have to be treated and protected under the geneva convention anymore ( at least not in that extent ) . 
  germany however voluntarily grants people who travelled through a second country the same rights , it is not obliged to , but choses to . 
  yeah , in reality stuff is more complicated than from your armchair . 
   who cares if they 're criminals or not ? 
  the comments in this thread that were deleted . 
   the second their asylum application has failed they become `` illegal immigrants '' no , they do n't , german law is more complicated . 
  registering is not the same as applying for asylum . 
  registering is a much quicker process via the [ easy-regsitration ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/easy_ ( erstverteilung_der_asylbegehrenden \\ ) ) , applying for asylum a pretty complicated process done by the ministry of immigration . 
  basically , yes . 
  there was some bullshit article talking about half a million unregistered refugees in germany , but just as the secretary [ stated ] ( http://m.tagesspiegel.de/politik/minister-reagiert-auf-medienbericht-de-maiziere-keine-500-000-unregistrierten-fluechtlinge/13406956.html?utm_referrer= ) , this is absolutely absurd . 
  you literally ca n't do anything in germany unless registered . 
  there was a problem with processing the registrations , but being processed but not finally registered is a completely different thing than not registering in the first place . 
   it 's not about the people wandering in and registering . 
  i disagree , i think those are the people that count the most , especially as they are the much , much bgiger group . 
   it 's about the dipshits that do refuse to be registered and those should be kicked out immediately without remorse . 
  if you are not registered it is impossible to get an aparment , a job , medical help , money ... i seriously doubt there are refugees in germany who did not register . 
  there was some bullshit article a few months ago claiming that there are half a million unregistered refugees in germany , but this was rejected immediatly . 
  you literally ca n't to anything in germany without registering . 
  this was brought up [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5dksh4/germany_to_deport_thousands_of_afghans/da5i4h8/ ) , german law still voluntarily accepts people as refugees under article 31 even if they came through a eu country . 
  yes , true . 
  the case of your uncle is different because he stayed _ after his visa expired _ . 
  this is indeed illegal . 
  but if he had , during the time of his tourist visa , applied for a residence permit or sought for asylum , it would have been legal . 
  some countries make it illegal to enter with a tourist visa with the intent to seek a residence permit , this is not the case in germany . 
  the geneva convention is not weakened , but strengthened . 
  basically , a wider class of people is granted the protection of article 31 . 
  answer : it 's complicated . 
  extremely complicated , and even too complicated to satisfactorily be expressed in a reddit comment ( at least i couldnt do this ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.anwalt.org/deportation/ ) is a website about the laws and workings of german deportation , but the actual process is even more complicated . 
  this is in article 31 geneva convention , but german law ( \u00a7 13 aufenthaltsgesetz ) explicitly overrules this if the refugee immediatly registers . 
   its the different between actual laws vs ethics . 
  i disagree , it is not knowing the law in the first place mixed with simply not liking foreigners that makes people think it is wrong . 
  you ca n't just `` wander in '' . 
  if you do , as stated , you immediatly have to register , which in turn immediatly starts an annoying , long , severely fucked up bureaucratic process during which you are not allowed to decide where you want to live , are n't allowed to work and basically are n't allowed to do anything unless you get a permit , for which you have to wait in line and then answer thousands of questions from some official while also filling out and handing in three different forms including the peit a38 . 
  i know , this is a germans paradise , which is a fitting explanation why there are quite a few germans that think being a refugee is wonderful .
