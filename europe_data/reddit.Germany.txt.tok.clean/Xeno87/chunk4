  aww , fuck you google maps !, 
   research about the german defector alfred liskow , who swam through the bordering river to warn a soviet major of the attack , ** getting shot as `` disinformant '' **, 
  it really is n't :  `` the weakest point is ahtisaari 's claim that churkin was speaking with moscow 's authority . 
  i think if he had told me what churkin had said , i would have replied i wanted to hear it from [ president vladimir ] putin too before i could take it seriously . 
  and even then i 'd have wanted to be sure it was n't a putin trick to draw us in to a process that ultimately preserved assad 's state under a different leader but with the same outcome . ''  [ ... ] however , the diplomat added : `` i very much doubt the p3 [ the us , uk and france ] refused or dismissed any such strategy offer at the time . 
  the questions were more to do with sequencing -- the beginning or end of process -- and with russia 's ability to deliver -- to get assad to step down . '' assad stepping down was never actually an option for russia . 
  yeah , you see , in the west historians are actually working on finding out the truth instead of burying it in propaganda , and since we germans are very concerned about _ ordnung _ we have tons of documents precisely showing what we did when why with whom . 
  and there are even tons of data in russian archives , precisely stating who called stalin when to inform him about what . 
  you might want to read up on unternehmen barbarossa and stalins forehand knowledge about it : * service , robert ( 2005 ) . 
  a history of modern russia : from nicholas ii to vladimir putin . 
  cambridge , ma : harvard university press . 
  * what stalin knew : the enigma of barbarossa * research about the german defector alfred liskow , who swam through the bordering river to warn a soviet major of the attack , getting shot as `` disinformant '' * research about harro schulze-boysen , arvid harnack and the `` rote kapelle '' that informed the soviets * research about the spy victor sorge , who reported the attack already on 5th of may with an _ original _ of a ribentrop telegram , and ten days later reported the _ exact _ date of the invasion to russian secret services . 
  * research about spy `` starshina '' , who on 17th of april reported of the incoming attack * how stalin treated officials wsewolod merkulow and pawel fitin for warning him, 
  not to mention that since _ years _ already , russia is blocking every single international effort to finally stop the syrian war . 
  you know , the `` yanks '' already decided that my country was worth bombing , did it and now i 'm living in one of the most civilized , economically and socially secured country on earth . 
  while `` the ivans '' are currently thinking about my country being worth bombing and blowing uo just because they do n't like it . 
  oh no wait , to save decadent west and bring back traditional christian values . 
  yeah this was so obvious that the german soldiers captured soviet soldiers sleeping in their barracks even after they were warned about unternehmen barbarossa by defectors ( which were shot instead of listened to ) . 
  nope . 
  this is a truly astonishing example of barking up the wrong tree . 
  ah , there is the difference : i know the japanese stance better than you do . 
  this was a total war and japan threatened that its entire population , including civilians , would rather die than surrender , which they actually already showed . 
  maybe you should read up on that stuff instead of just blaming the us ... 
  yup . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eg0etxl.jpg ) is a map showing the polish territory in 1938 , and [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/europe_before_operation_barbarossa%2c_1941_%28in_german%29.png ) is one after the annexion by germany and the ussr . 
  so yes , the first fights between the soviets and nazis occured on polish territory, 
   saying that the soviet union started ww2 is like saying ferdinand caused ww1 . 
  but it did . 
  it started ww2 together with germany , italy and japan . 
  this is what this thread here is all about . 
  best proof : in russia , ww2 only begins in 1941 ... 
  but but but ... you are already in eu ? 
  we 're all one happy living community !, 
   japan was prepared to fight to the end but saying they were therefor prepared to be nuked  fight to the end  prepared to be nuked  total annihilation  total anihilation ca n't see the difference . 
  you know , when you talk tough , then you should n't cry if you get fucked up . 
  and if you start a world war , enslave several nations , commit the cruelest crimes against humanity , and then have the fucking arrogance to say that you will fight until total anihilation ** after ** you got fucked by one atomic bomb already , no sorry , i do n't give a rats ass about that . 
  * edit * : japan talked tough as long as it thought it could take millions of american lives with it . 
  after being showed that this was n't the case , it truckled . 
  report czechoslovakia , no ss . 
  lol, 
   history is written by the winners . 
  no , history is written by historians . 
  even the cruel acts of the winners of ww2 are intensely studied and brought up all the time , as you can plainly see here . 
  but , and i ca n't stress this enough : * japan knew it had already lost militarily * japan still did not surrender unconditionally and threatened to fight for the last man standing * japan still did not surrender unconditionally after the first bomb getting hit by two atomic bombs is solely the responsibiltiy of japan , which not only started the war , but did refuse to end it . 
  and every single day without the atomic bombs would have meant more suffering for the japanese annexed parts of asia . 
  you ca n't talk about the civilians the atomic bombs killed without talking about the civillians they saved . 
  i think this is a very clear sign that the uk wo n't be leaving at all . 
  i 'm scared of talking to the baltic states because i 've got a total crush on them . 
  ah , great , thank you !, 
  i did n't find this thread again when looking for it . 
  really was a cool thread . 
  i 'm totally in for straight out saying that russia started the second world war along with germany ( pisses russian nationalists off just as much ) . 
  but i do n't like including the soviet union in the axis countries because for historians , this term is very clearly defined , and i do n't want to compromise this . 
  also , i must highlight that not all russians are the typical putin supporting , stalin apologizing , nationalistic pricks you so often see on the internet . 
  as much as i consider russia a serious threat and a fascist country and what not , it is important to keep in mind that not everybody living there is like this . 
  just like there were n't only nazis in germany , there are n't only fascists in russia . 
  and , almost ironically , this invasion cemented the end of poland as a country that only existed for 21 years , after not being allowed to exist for more than a hundred years ( 1795-1918 ) . 
  originally , i wanted to create an imgur album with newspapers from that day , like we had in the thread about the german invasion of poland on september 1st . 
  however , either i suck or it 's harder to find newspapers about this online . 
  the best i found so far [ is the archive of warmuseum.ca ] ( http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/newspapers/operations/poland_e.shtml ) with several english and french articles , which i wo n't convert into an album , but instead just link here . 
   there 's no cult of putin in russia . 
  at all .

  now let 's compare with the boring/criticizing results you get in _ a democracy _ : [ `` merkel cult '' ] ( http://imgur.com/a/opsew ) , [ `` obama cult '' ] ( http://imgur.com/a/q0n5u ) . 
  russia is a fascist country with a f\u00fchrer cult , infa 100 % . 
  and still , to destabilize the eu russia produces refugees in an almost industrial margin , fuels an absurd amount of propaganda and funds every extremist party there is , while simultaneously attacking and partially annexing the eu 's trading partners . 
  do you think it is a coincidence that rt is most consumed in the uk and then the uk actually votes to leave the eu , [ which is one of the key goals of the putin ideology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics#content ) ? 
  russia is schr\u00f6derizing our politicians and finlandizing the entirety of europe to achieve unthreatanable rule over this continent , and it is pretty good at that , despite its laughable state . 
  it 's called fascism . 
  a few decades ago , many germans and italians were showing the same behaviour . 
  cult of personality , propaganda and fearmongering against foreign countries and foreigners often does this . 
  really helps the `` we vs them '' mentality . 
   redditor for 2 months  full putin apologist how 's the weather in olgino ? 
  during wartimes , time is a very important factor , also you need to be much more careful . 
  someone owning russian propaganda is very likely to take up arms . 
  during peaceful times , simply detaining someone for having books/posters etc is unacceptable . 
  during war times , this gives you the means to prevent attacks even though you ca n't yet prove it . 
  there 's a reason that during any war , people who own propaganda of the enemy are being detained . 
  his conquests will be enormous if his puppet candidate trump wins the election . 
  while i certainly see how this is not a favourable thing to do in a democracy , i must acknowledge that ukraine is a country in war . 
  during such times , laws like this can be reasonable . 
  the nationality is still mentioned in the article . 
  i do n't really see the problem if you have to actually read an article to confirm your worldview instead of just skipping headlines . 
  [ remember the `` rebels '' of kharkiv storming the theatre because they thought it was the town hall ? 
  ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/news/protesters-storm-kharkiv-theater-thinking-it-was-city-hall-33739 ) is just local rebels , comrade , i swear . 
  why bully russia , such russophobe . 
  there 's a reason putin built very , very close ties to schr\u00f6der , still maintains very close ties to high ranking spd and csu politicians ( i.e. 
  gabriel , seehofer ) , funds the right wing extremists afd , the left wing extremists die.linke , has his propaganda channel rt have a special german version ( rt deutsch ) and also maintains [ a secret army group within germany ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/putins-secret-sleepers-waiting-for-a-signal/a-19196685 ) . 
  also , there just now were elections in a federal state where the putin funded afd got 20 % of the votes . 
  welcome to 1933 . 
  i 'm serious , when hillary wins , i 'll move to the us . 
  yeah , that was the weird lunatics idea in the 90 's . 
  those details are pretty much obsolete now i think , while the overall stuff is still in the making . 
  i guess we will see that once trump gets elected . 
   [ united kingdom should be cut off from europe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics#content ) seriously , it 's all going according to the lunatics plan . 
  lol . 
  grow a pair and meet a refugee once , might help . 
  and then read up on some stuff , because nothing is as black and white as you make it . 
   except that majority of the land occupied in the operation is from isis so you 're wrong .
