  since the original comment i replied to was deleted , i might share this again . 
  calling these refugees criminals simply for being here is a straight out lie . 
  and for refugees there the is geneva convention 31 stating that they can not be criminalized for entering the country without a visa if they immediatly register and claim their refugee status :  eine andere fallgruppe stellen diejenigen dar , die durch geltendmachung ihres fl\u00fcchtlingsstatus einen \u00fcber drei monate hinausgehenden aufenthaltstitel erwerben wollen ( und ggf .

  it sucks that it came down to this . 
  _ is not bomb comrade , is just of tourist _, 
  you know the difference between the usa ( until now ) and russia ? 
  when the us commits a war crime , e.g. 
  [ bombing a hospital ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunduz_hospital_airstrike ) , they [ acknowledge what happened , allow and support independent investigations , apologize and pay reparations . 
  oh , also they discipline those responsible . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunduz_hospital_airstrike#u.s._investigation.2c_apology.2c_and_reparations ) meanwhile , putins russia bombs hospitals on ** a fucking daily basis ** . 
  [ 5 hospitals in 48 hours ] ( http://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/five-major-hospitals-attacked-syria-past-48-hours ) . 
  no , the way to create a healthy eu is to make absolutely clear that if you join , you do n't get out anymore . 
  i know , you people are used to be able to always change your mind without consequences and think you deserve a participation award when you do , but on a scale of millions of people you either do it right or you do n't do it at all . 
  he was n't in a government office for pretty much half of the 10 years . 
  ... he was secretary of state from 2005-2009 and is it currently since 2013 . 
  he is the guy we sent to negotiate with russia when they attacked georiga , stole crimea , attacked ukraine . . you know that minsk ii, 
   that 's completely against the right to self determination . 
  you get the decision to join or not . 
  ... read it again . 
   so outlaw parties that are eu sceptics ? 
  yes . 
  joining the eu should have been a big decision that can not be undone due to it 's huge implications . 
  either do it or leave it , but not some fucked shit in between . 
  we need a eu that does not tolerate it 's enemies . 
  this was the mistake of the first german republic - that it tolerated parties that planned to abolish it . 
  yay , the guy that was a close buddy of schr\u00f6der . 
  the guy we send to negotiate with russia since a decade and instead of reaching anything , russia becomes more and more aggressive and threatening . 
  the guy who ca n't even represent our interests . 
  someone came up with the idea that the us under trump my would give the uk a very easy , short trade negotiation so it can easily go hard against the eu . 
  lol, 
  you mean the one showing a plunge every year ? 
  yeah , i did . 
  can you even read ? 
  lol, 
   use google ah , the argument of armchair generals . 
  you know [ i do n't even need to google ] ( http://imgur.com/cbptn5z ) to know that any `` plunge '' is just a yearly trend and that it even was the same in 2012 . 
  you do n't . 
  i wonder why that is ... 
   nothing we should just do nothing . 
  i mean , i gave you a possible solution , but if you wan na do nothing , that 's fine with me . 
  ignoring the fact that we do , how does sending them back stop migrants from landing on spanish beaches ? 
  do they just say `` huh , damn now they showed us , we will never try again and others will see our example and not even try '' ? 
   the mere fact that trump won office decreased illegal border crossing by a tremendous amount . 
  citation needed.jpg  when he started enacting his policies it went even lower . 
  lol , when did he sign anything ? 
  he was playing golf all the time pure and utter bullshit . 
  god dammit , now i _ have _ to upvote you ... 
   russian neber said that . 
  touched a nerve , huh ? 
  i 'm sure all this just goes away by voting ~ ~ nazis ~ ~ alt-righters into office . 
  i mean , what else should we do ? 
  start with an extended multinational peace mission in libya to stabilize the country and hope that stability in north africa reduces the need for migration ? 
  that is ridiculous . 
   people are stupid . 
  that 's what representative democracy is good for . 
  that 's also why in germany , popular votes are n't a thing on the federal level - we made some bad mistakes with that stuff back in the 20 's and 30 's . 
  anti-german , anti-eu , anti-sjw , anti-muslim hysteric redditor for a month . 
  who would 've thought ... 
  do n't forget what this is all about : russian oligarch money safe-harboured in the us . 
  russian oligarchs ca n't access their money anymore due to [ the magnitsky act ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/14/the-magnitsky-act-explained/ ) . 
  that 's why putin desperately wants it removed . 
  that 's why he hopes for alternatives . 
   greece being flooded with migrants  greece 's asylum service says requests have been made to return more than 400 migrants . 
  seven requests have been accepted so far . 
  i spilled a glass of water this morning , guess i need to declare a state of emergency because of flooding . 
  please read the article :  `` some member states have made requests but transfers have not begun . 
  _ greece has to give assurances that they have adequate reception conditions _ ''  greece 's asylum service says requests have been made to return more than 400 migrants . 
  seven requests have been accepted so far . 
   in athens , greece 's migration minister said the returns would involve `` tiny numbers . '' i 'm all for shared responsibilities , but portraying this as `` getting fucked over '' is pretty sensationalist . 
  i think `` held on serbian soil '' was a dead give away . 
  seems like this is mostly an issue because of east germany 's handling of such books . 
  you forgot `` ban the use of local language and oppress every minority '' . 
   are you really advocating foreign invasion in defense of judiciary ? 
  this is insanity . 
  why ? 
  if france and the uk had done this in 1933 to germany , ww2 would have been prevented . 
  if nato had done it in yugoslavia , the bosnian genocide could have been prevented . 
  why do we always have to wait for war and genocides to happen when we can intervene already when separation of powers is abolished ? 
   separation of powers does n't mean closed caste of privileged overlords . 
  and it sure as hell does n't mean `` give the justice minister the power to do everything '' . 
  ok , so poland _ already _ in a civil war with mass killings would be enough . 
  so what about poland in a civil war _ without _ mass killings , but mass arrests ? 
  or poland at the edge of a civil war with mass arrests ? 
  and we 're talking about something very simply here - separation of powers . 
  that 's something every eu country agrees on when joining . 
  why is reinstalling this so bad ? 
  abolishing it should be considered worse . 
  oh comrade , is of fascist nazi junta missiles in ukraine , not of glorious patriotic peace missiles in russia !, 
  _ never _ ? 
  so even if poland would dive straight into as civil war and one party committed mass killings , it would n't be morally justified ? 
  while this is definitely an important part , i do n't think it is the single most defining feature that makes the holocaust singular . 
  there were others , like the german state becoming completely and totally focussed on achieving that goal , even going so far as depriving the wehrmacht of resources to keep the death camps going or using the national bank to launder the victims money . 
  or , as i already mentioned , the industrialized character of the killing . 
  but yeah , i definitely forgot to mention the complete elimination of an entire ethnic group . 
   it 's interesting how , speaking about ww2 , noone cares much about anything else than the holocaust . 
  what ? 
  what is this even supposed to mean ? 
  wan na know the `` fixation '' on the `` 6 million '' ?
