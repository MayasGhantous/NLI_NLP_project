  because it was different than anything before . 
  massacres have happened before . 
  60 thousand being killed ? 
  the [ greek genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide ) , [ assyrian genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide ) or [ holodmor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) are things that happened before and cost more lives . 
  it may sound cruel but genocides and mass killings have been commited throught mankinds history . 
  the holocaust was different . 
  it was so completely different . 
  it was _ industrialized _ killing . 
  it was so much more organized , happened over a longer time period , over several countries and ethnicities . 
  it was something completely new , a new peak in human de-humaniziation . 
  it was unimaginable , even the worst massacres faded in contrast to it . 
  `` noone cares much about anything else than the holocaust '' ? 
  yeah , maybe those who do n't care about ww2 at all besides history channel documentaries . 
  everyone who does is painfully aware of all those other atrocities , and why they are still not even comparable to the holocaust in terms of cruelty . 
  so , when is it morally justified for other eu members to militarily intervene and restore the separation of powers ? 
   ( no questions asked ) so you 're saying we can do all what you proposed in other countries but not here ? 
   allow them to submit their asylum applications at any eu embassy in their own country that 's what people are trying , but the embassies are completely unprepared for that task . 
  the german embassy in libanon ( responsible for syrian refugees ) is very small and has immense troubles . 
  good , that means after an official has checked that their requests are declined . 
  i 'm ok with that . 
  so why did n't you tell right away that you are just caring about race ? 
  i would n't have to look up actual proven solutions then and could have ignored you . 
   shut our borders ... you do n't seem to understand that this is n't possible at all , and it does not solve the problem . 
  what , you mean stabilizing the countries of origin of refugees like we did in the yugoslavian wars ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_interim_administration_mission_in_kosovo , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_protection_force ) does not make any sense ? 
  weird , because that , along with the respective nato interventions ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_deliberate_force ) solved the last [ refugee crisis ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/24/world/yugoslav-refugee-crisis-europe-s-worst-since-40-s.html ) . 
   the majority are not refugees that 's up to a trained official to decide , not some reddito commenters . 
  if they are not eligible for refugee status , then why are you so frightened of them applying for asylum ? 
  it would be dismissed anyway after all . 
   for all 54 states in africa well you mgiht wan na start doing your homework on afria then , because we only have refugees from some countries . 
   that is the most delusional thing i 've yet seen written ah , telling a soldier to shoot at unarmed civilians is more delusional . 
  lol . 
  i 'm the guy proposing we do exactly the same like last refugee crisis - an actual intervention in the ground with troops . 
  worked with yugoslavia and the refugee crisis , will work again . 
  which is a shitty thing because the people who invented the refugee convention actually knew what war , famine and seeking refuge meant . 
  i doubt that you do . 
  sounds more like you are . 
  i do n't want to shoot at refugees . 
  i was thinking how to solve the actual problem , not treat symptoms . 
   well the will of the people in this regard is basically one hundred percent in line with that of the military oh.look , the guy wanting to use lethal force against refugees thinks he knows what european people want . 
  the same european people.who elected the politicians he says have failed . 
  almost like he is an anti democratic guy wanting to topple elected governments . 
  what do we call those again ? 
  are you working in an asylum office ? 
  because usually we let professionals judge that , not reddit commenters . 
  give some african countries the same treatment as western europe after ww2 . 
  you know , actual effort . 
   you should be ashamed of yourself ! '', 
  takes quite an idiot to misread that like this . 
  when you want to shoot at people because they like.your country you are fucked in the head beyond repair, 
  against geneva convention . 
  ca n't return refugees to the country they are fleeing from . 
  that 's not for you to decide but to a european asylum office . 
  lol . 
  do you know the actual reason refugees do n't fly with planes or use ordinary ferries ? 
  protip : it 's not because it 's illegal . 
  you know what , i 'm fine with this . 
  so let 's actually say it : we can stop the migrant crisis if we 'd actually send ground troops into libya to stabilize the entire country , along with a huge amount of money . 
  or toppled african dictators who waste development aid . 
  oh what , that 's not what you meant ? 
  well too bad . 
  when your country is so attractive that you need to shoot at people to keep them away , there is something wrong . 
  with you . 
  for example not knowing any laws . 
  like the geneva convention on refugees or that ferry services from africa to the eu are 100 % legal . 
  what ? 
  `` quite eager '' ? 
  there was _ one _ instance of german media ( namely , zdf in 2013 ) using the term `` polnisches vernichtungslager '' . 
  zdf was sued , it apologized , but this term was , as far as my knowledge goes , not used before or after this documentary ever again by german media ( disclaimer : i ca n't speak for right wing extremist blogs ) . 
  yeah , that whole thing about responsibility for ww2 and stuff only started with the '68 movement , but then it did . 
  holy hell . 
   and , as any other nation they obviously need their history to be proud of . 
  ahem . 
  i think one country has shown a different approach . 
  that 's why basically everybody thinks about organized crime than terrorism . 
  the eu is spending money in the context of its space policy to esa . 
  esa is the contractor of the eu to fulfill its goal . 
  calling esa part of the eu because of its spending is like saying lockheed martin belongs to the us government because it invests so much money into it . 
  * [ `` we have plenty to learn from [ north ] korea -- like having a sense of the greatness of one 's motherland , '' russian ultra-nationalist philosopher and current adviser to the kremlin , alexander dugin told the moscow times in 2001 . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/19/how-north-korean-magazines-accidentally-subverted-the-ussr ) * [ alexander dugin on north korea : `` nuclear weapons distribution is good '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob6c7du10sc&amp;feature=youtu.be ) * [ even russia 's alexander dugin , an ideologue for white nationalists , has praised pyongyang as an `` island of freedom , '' arguing that russia should provide it with weapons of mass destruction to protect its sovereignty . 
  `` if their weapons take flight , we [ the russian people ] should cheer them on ! '' he says . 
  `` to not understand that north korea is a seed of humanism and democracy in the face of an american occupation is to demonstrate complete and utter ignorance . '' ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2017/07/alt-reich-north-korea-and-the-far-right/ ), 
  what kind of argument is that ? 
  * edit * : oh i get it . 
  it 's `` we ca n't do anything because america '' . 
   we do n't provide them with technologies or needed materials that we know of . 
  * edit * : and then again , [ russia _ is _ backing north korea ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/26/why-is-putin-backing-north-korea-to-build-up-russia-as-a-great-power/ ) , it is sending high ranking officials to pyongyang ( and vice versa ) . 
  so do n't try to frame western countries as bad , because russia is a whole step ahead in helping nk as they are . 
  russia is an ally to nk , so do n't cry when its taken into responsibility . 
  language barrier strikes again . 
  well , yeah , `` affiliated with '' was probably the wrong term , what i meant was that esa is not an eu institution ( against which pis often rails , does n't it ? ), 
  sigh . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency#european_union  esa is not an agency or body of the european union ( eu ) , and has non-eu countries ( belarus , iceland , liechtenstein , norway , and switzerland ) as members . 
  there are however ties between the two , with various agreements in place and being worked on , to define the legal status of esa with regard to the eu . 
  technically , esa is not affiliated with the eu at all . 
   no , the eu funds are not reparations at all legally , not . 
  morally , yes . 
   unless you want to say that eu is just another greater germany project . 
  it booggles my mind that there are people posting on / r/europe not knowing the historical context of the eu as we know it today ( single market , single currency ) . 
  during the late eighties , france and great britain were quite opponent to the idea of german reunification . 
  it was therefore their demand that germany will be crucial part in an european union where it was tightly restricted and integrated so it could pose no harm to the rest of europe .
