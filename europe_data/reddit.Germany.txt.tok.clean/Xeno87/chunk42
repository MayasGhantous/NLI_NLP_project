  this is why mitterand and thatcher changed their views on german reunification . 
   [ mitterrand recognized before thatcher that reunification was inevitable and adjusted his views accordingly ; unlike her , he was hopeful that participation in a single currency and other european institutions could control a united germany . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reunification#britain_and_france ) the tight integration into the eu as a supranational structure is also the reason why with the 2 +4 treaty , all foreign claims for reparations became void . 
  it is understood that germany makes up for the damage it did during ww2 with its significant contributions to the eu . 
  so do you call those other 4 instances in germany this week also terrorism ? 
  was it nazi terrorism ? 
  disco terrorism ? 
  what was it ? 
   so its only terrorism when they use a car and more than 1 person is involved that 's a good indicator for an actual isis attack . 
  bombs , cars , guns , multiple people , coordination . 
  not just some weirdo with a knife who gets his ass kicked by bystanders . 
  yeah , and the attackers in the other recent attacks were partly muslim , partly not . 
  does n't mean they are terrorists , either . 
  frankly , this _ is _ local crime . 
  it 's most likely a lone psycho with a knife and not an actual isis operation due to no cars or other attackers being involved . 
  lol , please point out the denying . 
   but you should 've paid a bit more than a 1/100th of it . 
  :p well , the eu is n't over yet :p, 
  yeah and there have been reports of him wielding a machete ( mentioned in the article ) . 
  which also was n't true . 
  yeah i 'd say the drugs and mental problems are more to blame than islam . 
  drug addict with psychological problems takes a knife and goes on a rampage . 
  top minds of / r/europe conclude that it 's a strategically planned operation by isis . 
  not to mention that it 's understood that germany 's payments to the eu and neighboring countries are part of such reparation . 
   [ a police spokeswoman said she could not confirm a report by a female witness on television that the attacker shouted `` allahu akbar '' , arabic for `` god is greatest '' , as he ran out of the supermarket . 
  ] ( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-security-hamburg-iduskbn1ad1ue ) even the munich shooter was rewported to have shouted allahu akhbar . 
  it 's almost as if witnesses in distress are n't always the most reliable sources . 
  that sounds like it was translated less aggressive than it was meant . 
  which might be a good thing when translating official statements . 
  [ bill browder 's testimony explains very well why those sanctions tought them ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/ ), 
  yeah but listen to all those redditors telling us that this is dumb , that russia does n't do this , that it 's a witch hunt ... 
  when i think of iceland i think of ice . 
  when you tell me there 's 26 \u00b0 there , i do n't laugh . 
  ban russia from swift already . 
   50 % were unemployed after 5 years and still 30 % were unemployed after 10 years 30 % unemployed after 10 years ? 
  this is [ in line with the amount of female asylum seekers ] ( https://m.bpb.de/politik/innenpolitik/flucht/218788/zahlen-zu-asyl-in-deutschland ) . 
  almost as if those families have more traditional gender roles where the man brings home the money and the woman stays at home . 
  and historically , [ 19 out of 20 countries ] ) https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/opinion/europe-should-see-refugees-as-a-boon-not-a-burden.html ) have made an economic net gain from taking in refugees . 
  just like the refugee crisis of 1994-1996 , this refugee crisis will pay off . 
  you forgot nazi merkel . 
  wrong . 
  [ asylum seekers are as often affected by chickenpox , flu or measles as the rest of the population . 
  ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article161805093/fluechtlinge-haben-keine-exotischen-krankheiten-mitgebracht.html ) there have been more cases because there have been more people . 
  however , the percentage has not risen . 
  you mean in payments for the social system : http://mobil.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/zuwanderung-stabilisiert-sozialkassen-article19953578.html millions of payers for healthcare and pension , stabilizing them . 
  our systems made a net profit , not a loss . 
   the german public broadcasting tv is acutally especially designed to make the power over them very limited the whole reason for those 17,50 $ per month is that they can be as independent as possible . 
   answer the following question with a yes or no man you really need to keep your worldview simple , do n't you ? 
  so basically you think that you , having done basically zero research , are more qualified than people who have done research and worked in that matter for years ? 
  yeah , totally would n't have expected that . 
  and your qualification in this regard is ... 
  some circlejerky sub ? 
  a blog post ? 
  your one month experience on reddit ? 
  so if that were the case , you 'd have no problem with african migrants coming ? 
  i 'm `` shilling '' for everyone . 
  i 'm neither opposed to migrants from africa or from romania . 
  i trust my immigration officials to be more qualified to judge their skills than i am . 
  but when it 's migrants from africa or the middle east who leave their countries because of the exact same reasons it 's a very bad thing and they should be stopped/their boats should get sunk . 
  / r/europe is weird . 
  it 's weird , / r/europe claims that all these people leaving romania are skilled workers . 
  politicians in germany [ say that they are welfare leeches ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/csu-chef-horst-seehofer-und-die-zuwanderungsdebatte-a-941886.html ) . 
  and on top of that , what german politicians say about romanian people migrating , / r/europe says about african or middle eastern migrants . 
  who should i believe now ? 
   norwegian and scottish is more expensive the prices for russian natural gas before 2014 were significantly higher than they are now , and nobody complained . 
  why is it now a problem ? 
   gulf states are significantly more agressive and dangerous than russia would ever be no gulf state has ever attacked or annexed our eu associates . 
  no gulf state has nuclear weapons . 
   but also signficiantly less available . 
  well thank god there are more than 50 other countries that also produce natural gas  i said its advantegous for germany to import russian gas and germany needs a grip on the russian gas market due to geostrategic considerations . 
  its not about the gas , its about the market . 
  how on earth is germany supposed to use its access to russian gas geostrategically ? 
  `` if oyu do n't stop attacking ukraine , we will stop importing your gas after we made our economy depend on it for 50 % '' ? 
   either we are blackmail vulnerable with gas from russia , in which case ns2 makes no difference in that regard . 
  ns2 will further strengthen the sance of russian gas in germany - it is exactly `` un-diversifying '' our energy . 
   in fact the one more blackmail vulnerable here is russia , since ns2 is a significant investment for them and they ` need ' to sell that gas way more than we have to buy it . 
  money means little when you can hold back the product . 
   but its not , so lucky us . 
  i 'm surprised you want to throw any more money at russia . 
  you realize that every dollar way pay towards russia is a dollar it can spend on its military actions in ukraine ? 
  seriously , i would n't be surprised if you got a gazprom paycheck . 
   thats a economical interest . 
  seeing how ukraine is at war with russia , it is a defense interest . 
   i explicitly mentioned other options are available , but they are less enviromental friendly norwegian gas is just as `` energy-friendly '' as russian gas . 
   how would we be more dependant on them ? 
  what , your entire argument was that germany ** needs ** russian gas . 
  which means that when we build ns2 we are dependent on russia and can be blackmailed . 
   the budapest memorandum was signed by the uk and the usa , and neither of those is `` dependant '' on russians gas , yet they `` could n't prevent '' it either . 
  not a reason to give russia another lever to blackmail us . 
   we can ` use ' russian gas , because its cheap and easily available . 
  not a necessity when it 's against our and our partners interests , which is my entire argument . 
  maybe _ you _ should start reading what other people write . 
  our and our partners defense interests outweigh our need to save a tiny bit of money . 
   i said we do n't want to because the alternatives are strictly worse . 
  feel free to show how other soruces of gas are `` strictly '' worse . 
  but i doubt that anything else will come from you other than `` russia good !, 
  need more russian gas !, 
  ukraine and poland btfo !, 
  german money more important !, 
   there is no defense interest involved here .
