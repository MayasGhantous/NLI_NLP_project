  [ . . ] there is nothing about ns2 that makes ee more vulnerable to russia . 
  of course there is . 
  ukraine alone loses 1.5 bn $ per year if gas is tunneled through ns2 instead of the available routes . 
  this _ is _ a defense interest . 
   and ensures germany does n't lose grip on the russian gas market which we need a. ), 
  because its cheaper and more enviromental friendly than american fracking gas and b. ), 
  to have a economical leverage to pressure russia if we need to . 
  what a load of crap , you are pretending that russian gas is the only availabe source of gas , which it is n't . 
  and apparently , we do n't have economical leverage to pressure russia because a ) we would be more dependent on them as you just stated , and b ) we could n't even prevent russia from attacking and annexing parts of georgia and ukraine . 
  i mean , you go on explaining how germany _ needs _ russian gas and then say that russia ca n't blackmail us in return over it . 
  what the fuck . 
  * edit * : i just realized that you also called for ukraine and poland to `` just diversify '' their energy budget , while pretending that germany ca n't do the same . 
  so you 're saying our economic interests outweigh the defensive interests of our nato partners and possible eu associates ? 
  germany is n't alone on this continent . 
  * edit * you might also wan na explain why you think russia should have more benefits from germany than poland or ukraine . 
  because you ca n't make any money when russia annexes eastern europe . 
   the new pipeline is in german interest only in a financial way . 
  however , our money ca n't outweigh the security interests of two countries , which should have been taken into consideration . 
   feed ukraine still a weird statement . 
  this is not how anything works . 
   there is nothing to take from ukraine or poland in this context . 
  we just do n't want to give them money . 
  so it is a pipeline that directly is against ukraine 's and poland 's interest , but in favor of russian interests . 
  germany should not reward russia for its recent aggression and germany should also think of the interest of its reliable trading partners . 
   feeding them is your business now , not ours . 
  that 's a weird statement . 
  * edit * : not to mention that the financial aspects are n't the worst thing about ns2 , it 's the strategic geopolitical aspects which make it a problem . 
  germany should seriously consider the interests of its reliable partners more than russia in that regard . 
   north stream doesnt do anything . 
  of course it does . 
  by the pipeline circumventing poland , russia could safely cut off its gas transfer to poland while still supplying western europe , giving russia _ another _ way to put pressure on a eu state and isolate it . 
  it also circumvents ukraine and by this helps russia to save money while taking it from ukraine , which is totally is in russias interest again . 
  even worse , nordstream 2 is the complete owner and operator of this pipeline , making this effectively a completely russian operated pipeline . 
  it helps russia save money , takes away money from ukraine , isolates poland and is owned _ and _ operated by russia . 
  this shit is russia ^ ( 10 ) . 
  #breaking news : netherlands annex flevoland, 
  `` civil war '' - not at all . 
  there is n't a civil war now and the country is already divided . 
  there have been coups before and the people just took it . 
  because this is the reality - no matter if nato invades afghanistan , or america invades iraq , or russia invades ukraine ( or the entirety of eastern europe ) or nazi germany the whole night r europe - there 's never a civil war . 
  there are maybe some partisans , or some terrorists , but those are there already . 
  a coup would play out just like everytime in history - with the people taking it . 
  the number of people says that it 's a demonstration in russia . 
  that 's like a christopher street day in saudi arabia . 
  money is a lesser price than indepence and democracy . 
  man i would love to see a real nato coup in turkey happening . 
  well , it has happened before : * http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/07/swift-bans-several-north-korean-banks-wsj-reports.html * https://www.rferl.org/a/explainer_how_does_swift_ban_hurt_iran/24518153.html, 
  i 'm sorry for the snarky remark , i just have quite some toxic messages currently and was in that toxic mood . 
  oh hey , so poland is just mimicking russia and putin but hey , since it 's totally in opposition to it this is completely different !, 
  i mean , poland becoming like russia , that 's like , gee rick , i dunno that 's that 's thats ... as if national socialists in germany and the bolshewiks in russia would cooperate . 
  i mean they are total enemies and complete opposites of each other . 
  how should that work out ? 
  there 's no way they hate democracy so much that they would team up , would they ? 
  because ... there are n't any other sources of gas than russia ? 
  putin could annex the entirety of ukraine and we still would n't kill ns2 or ban them from swift . 
  it is disgusting . 
  yeah , our relations are so bad now that we will only build 2 more pipelines controlled and operated by russia !, 
  that will show them !, 
  ` tis but a scratch !, 
  it got better in germany the last years because it was freuqently called out . 
   the rest of your post does n't deserve a comment . 
  yeah , you only need an engine `` and the rest is straightforward '' ... [ ever heard fo the dunning-kruger-effect ? 
  ] ( https://cdn0.gamesports.net/storage/66000/66069.jpg ) ever wondered why it took 4 years `` just '' to design ariane 6 ? 
  that 's not including building it . 
  a completely new vehice with so far untested , never used before engines and you think you can `` just build it '' . 
  you have absolutely no idea of this topic . 
   nope . 
  i am using it in the linguistic sense , you quibble with insisting on the physics meaning , which i am perfectly aware of . 
  maybe you should stop using terminology of fields you do n't understand . 
   quantum leap = a sudden large increase or advance . 
  do n't quibble . 
  nope . 
  a quantum leap is just a change from one discrete energy level to another , and those nergy levels are ( usually ) of extremely small magnitudes compared to human standards .

  great way to start your post with showing how little research you put into your thoughts . 
   do me a favour and read something about their trl . 
  yeah do me a favor and research more than just rading wikipedia articles . 
   the rest is fairly straightforward . 
  and actually work on something once . 
  poland is turning _ russian _ . 
  it is no coincidence that after having tolerated that insane dictator in moscow for almost twenty years , democracies in europe die like flies . 
  but does n't the nuclear option require an unanimous vote of all the other member states ? 
  because i really ca n't see orban agreeing to this . 
  i say putin has flipped erdogan . 
   we need a quantum leap which is one of the smallest changes possible . 
   why do n't we develop skylon because we need something reliable , right now , which has proven to work . 
  there is n't even a prototype of the sabre engine , implying that this vehicle , should it actually attempted to be built , wo n't be ready for the next 10 to 15 years . 
  you 're basically saying here : `` urgh , why are we building electric , but conventional cars , so boring !, 
  we should buy flying cars with mr. fusion instead ! '', 
   the problem that i see with the trump administration killing this bill by waiting until recess is that congressmen will see it as trump undermining them and their institutional power as members of congress and what if that was the plan all along , which is also the reason why republicans agreed on a bipartisan bill ? 
  agree to a bill because you know it will never pass into law , and the public ( or at least , your voters ) will not notice because it gets lost somwhere . 
  yeah wow , what argument . 
   any attempt to somehow kill it by the administration will immediately be connected to trump-russia collusion so ? 
  all the other stuff was ignored , too . 
   if trump does n't sign this bill , he would be pouring gasoline on the fire yeah but nothing matters anymore . 
  you can lie on your sf-86 four times , or lie under oath , and it does n't matter . 
  why should it now ? 
  fox news will just say [ how collusion is ok ] ( http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/12/eric-bolling/collusion-not-illegal-fox-news-host-eric-bolling-s/ ) , republicans will excuse trump [ because he 's new to the job ] ( http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/paul-ryans-excuse-for-trump-hes-just-new-to-this.html ) , and nothing will happen .
