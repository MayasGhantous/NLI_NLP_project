  it 's not ? 
  if the president does not sign it , it becomes law within 10 days . 
  if congress goes into recess before , it dies . 
  why does n't it work like this ? 
  * edit * : [ this is discussed in / r/politics , too ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6owniq/congress_reaches_deal_on_russia_sanctions/dkks12o/ ), 
   do n't you really see a difference ? 
  no because i 'm not scared shitless because of the religion of people . 
   converting to islam , will do no good to 16 yo white european girl . 
  would not compare it to buddhist . 
  why ? 
  [ because you know nothing about it , too ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buddhism_and_violence ), 
  sooo ... trump is going to ignore this law , congress goes into recess and it dies ? 
  so what ? 
  my sister went through a buddhist phase with 17 and my parents did the same . 
  maybe you will understand once you have kids yourself . 
   are you joking ? 
  a french citizen can work in germany without getting any special approval by the german government . 
  somebody from india ca n't do that . 
  what do you think schengen is ? 
  damn , i got ta call my friend from australia who had a job here in germany and then took another one in den haag and moved over . 
  she will be pissed knowing that / u/tschwib says she ca n't do that . 
   it 's a law that simply has no basis in reality anymore . 
  it was written under different circumstances . 
  yeah , it was written by peopel who have lived through war and ictatorship , unlike a spoiled basement dweller who thinks applying for asylum is liek wandering into a country for free . 
  go visit an asylum shelter once and talk to those people , you mgiht learn something . 
   you can travel to all eu-countries and work there . 
  non-eu-citizens ca n't do that lol , stop making shit up . 
  i ca n't even call this oversimplification because you do n't even know enough about the situation here . 
   nice argument . 
  `` hurr , the constitution includes something i do n't like , i must abolish it '' . 
  yup , that 's he very definition . 
  if you do n't like many people longing for asylum , maybe try wokring for a world where they do n't have the need for asylum . 
  like not bombing their countries to shit or killing their economy . 
   then you should also be against preferential treatment of eu-citizens when it comes to employment and residency . 
  wccih preferential treatment are you quoting here ? 
   and if the constitution said that every person on earth has the right to get a free bmw it would still be unrealistic . 
  yeah . 
  found the verfassungsfeind . 
  you 're not hiding that very well . 
  disclaimer : i 'm doing this in german . 
  these are basics taught in every german school about our constitution . 
  1 abs . 
  the right for asylum is deeply in the german constitution . 
  this is n't about taxation , it is about basic human rights . 
  yeah , you can keep wanking over dictators winning popularity contests without competitors ( because they 're dead ) . 
  but having a high approval rating in a democracy is playing politics in hard mode . 
  you should first find out what those organisations in the mediterranean actually do and then try to make up examples . 
   by any measure , the man is genuinely popular in russia . 
  this applies to every leader in any country with a tight state controlled , not independent press . 
  the only approval ratings that actually matter are those in a democracy . 
   inspire some unstable people to copy his acts . 
  [ like yourself ? 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/4en3h8/everyone_welcome_to_sweden/d21qfoh/ ) it looks like you just want to bury white , christian terrorism . 
  because you were at distress ... in the air ? 
  who would 've thought ? 
  it 's almost as if soviet border control would 've prevented people from leaving ... 
  after chrustschow , there came andropow , tschernenkow , gorbatschow . 
  it _ got _ better , the successor _ was _ less imperialistic . 
  maniacs never surround themselves with bigger , smarter maniacs . 
  how to misread a statement . 
  you know , when we 're talking about such low percentages , then the obvious and most effective approach to tackle that crime is more police or harder and quicker punishment . 
  that 's enough . 
  and not shutting down our borders , deporting everyone and starting a race war . 
  this is not up to the ships captain to decide or know . 
  they can catch a break as soon as that maniac in moscow drops dead . 
  oh sorry , language barrier striking again . 
  mixed up decades and centuries, 
  oh god please no . 
  i enjoy moderate , factual german news !, 
  http://www.eoi.es/blogs/redinnovacioneoi/files/2016/11/frases-justicia-euroresidentes.jpg  because migration is not some kind of magical universal right . 
  the only countries with that approach were part of the soviet union or nazi germany . 
  i see where you get your ideas from . 
  well one possibility could be that the youth in western europe is now disconnected from the second world war . 
  previous generations either experienced ww2 , it 's aftermath , or had parents who experienced this first hand . 
  this new generation does n't . 
  it does n't have the direct `` link '' to ww2 . 
  oh sorry , i misread that . 
  but do you really have that feeling ? 
  it does n't look very much like this to me in western europe . 
  of course there has been a surge , but i still think the youth overall is more left than right . 
  but is n't that not surprising considering the controlled state media ? 
  i 'm convinced this is the result of a russian disinformation and subversion campaign in eastern europe , however , i ca n't prove it . 
  but if hungarian or polish politicians turn out to have extremely close ( financial ) ties to russia , i would n't be surprised . 
  and then again , do n't forget that ee was behind the iron curtain for centuries . 
  democracy has n't been around for very long there , which explains the unstable foundation in society . 
  you are comparing extremely rare occurances to entire political movements with  30 % support in countries . 
  germany allows same sex marriage , and there is an [ earthquake in turkey and greece ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/21/kos-strong-earthquake-greece-turkey ) .

  it 's a pretty sensationalist title ( which is surprising for dw ) , but a good article . 
  look at the account ages . 
  they were all made when trump announced to run for president , or are completely new . 
  returning migrants back to libya is a violation of article 33 of the geneva conventions . 
  so the law should apply differently to people depending on their nationality , is that what you 're saying ? 
  so basically , preemptively punish  99 % of people because there might be < 1 % criminals ? 
  that 's what you 're saying ? 
  not going after criminals , but after everyone ? 
  people smuggling implies an illegal border crossing . 
  in their case , the people are brought straight to eu border control in harbours to apply for asylum . 
  no border crossing happened .
