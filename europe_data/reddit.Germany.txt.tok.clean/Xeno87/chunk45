  it 's not smuggling if you do n't cross a border illegally . 
  and there is n't an illegal border crossing here , they land legally in the eu and go straight to authorities . 
   italy should crack down on on all ngo 's , including this one . 
  and how ? 
  there 's is n't anything illegal happening . 
   the migrant issue is a matter of eu state vessels no , it is n't ? 
  it 's up to eu institutions to decide who qualifies for asylum or not . 
  it 's not illegal to ferry people to the eu for money , it is n't illegal to rescue people in distress on sea , it is n't illegal to bring people to eu border control/customs at an harbour and let them apply for asylum . 
  however , it is illegal and against the geneva convevtion to return a refugee to the country he came from ( article 33 ) . 
  there is n't any illegal immigration happening . 
  those people are dropped off at the harbour where they go to customs and border control and apply for asylum . 
  nobody entered any country illegally . 
  funnily , even if those ngo 's would charge money to ferry people from africa to the eu it would n't be illegal . 
  resubmitted , now with sources for the mods : * https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesellschaftstaat/bevoelkerung/migrationintegration/migrationintegration.html;jsessionid=ea805bd8b3d86c2949c85c47b3313f33.cae2#tabellen * https://www.bka.de/de/aktuelleinformationen/statistikenlagebilder/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/pks2016/standardtabellen/standardtabellentatverdaechtige.html and a beautiful pink ribbon for the / r/dataisugly crowd ( all data is beautiful ! ) . 
  the [ original post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6oi6qx/german_crime_stats_2016_rape_and_sexual_assault/ ) wanted you to focus on percentages < 0.7 % while presenting it incorrectly and suggestively . 
  do n't let them do that , focus on the  99 % foreigners in germany who are good people . 
  as a follow up to [ this completely flawed `` statistic '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6oi6qx/german_crime_stats_2016_rape_and_sexual_assault/ ) . 
  99.28 % of algerians were not suspects in a rape or sexual assault case . 
  whoever made that original diagramm with its methodology had only one thing in mind : incite hate against minorities . 
  i 've had enough of those basement dwelling kids longing for a race war . 
   then divide every number by 100,000 if it makes you happy . 
  that 's not how this works . 
  but you know , 0,69 % of algerian in germany being suspect in a groping or harassment case does n't sound too alarmist for you , does n't it ? 
   if there was ** one guy from the vatican living in germany ** who the fuck is talking about the population of vatican ? 
   are you opposed to statistics that take proportionality into account ? 
  yes , because it 's useless . 
  it favors large groups and puts small ones at a disadvantage . 
  lol . 
  in this thread : people who normally pretend that women just make up rape claims are shouting `` reeeeeeeeeeeee '' over 148 algerian suspects in all kinds of sexual crimes , from exhibitionism , child porn , rape to groping . 
  talk about being triggered . 
  great , so if there was one guy from the vatican living in germany being accused of rape ( highly likely ) , this would show up as 100.000 . 
   `` ausl\u00e4ndischer tatverd\u00e4chtiger auf 100.000 einwohner '' wait a second , so these are not convicts but suspects , and it does n't show the amount of crimes that happened , but the number of suspects in relation to the total number of people in the population group ? 
  am i misunderstanding this or is that weird shit ? 
  * edit * : copyright of an [ mostly empty twitter account ] ( https://twitter.com/derhorus ) ? 
  this is weird . 
  * edit2 * : there are [ 21.320 algerians in germany ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/araber_in_deutschland#demografie ) , so does that mean there have been 138 algerien suspcts accused of rape ? 
  and there are 1.4 million turks in germany , does that mean there have been 994 turks accused of rape ? 
  it really requires a special kind of `` personality trait '' to accuse multiple , independent sources of lying and not providing proof . 
  and in case you forgot , i still trust several journalists and lawyers more than reddit commenters . 
  because i doubt you are anything similar . 
  you really did n't get that `` earned my trust '' part , did you ? 
  how those sources earned it and others lost it because they oversimplified , overestimated or straight out lied ? 
   its better to check thing for yourself . 
  this is almost impossible because i would have to study polish law ( and language ) then . 
  however , i 'd like to finish my current degree . 
   you chose to trust a journalist . 
  that 's why you always rely on multiple sources . 
  * https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/18/polish-government-brings-forward-plans-to-assert-control-over-judges * https://oko.press/the-end-of-independent-judiciary-in-poland-pis-government-brakes-the-constitution-and-assumes-control-over-all-courts/ * http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40617406 * http://www.politico.eu/article/polish-opposition-calls-for-international-oversight-of-judiciary-vote/ this paints a pretty coherent picture . 
  not to mention that journalists and their respective institutions can earn and lose the trust i put in them , and euobserver has done a good job at earning it . 
   experts also point out that the changes grant extraordinary powers to the minister of justice , zbigniew ziobro , a close ally of pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski . 
   with the newly granted prerogatives to appoint and dismiss judges - including those at the supreme court - or to hand-pick judges for particular court cases , the minister of justice also becomes a `` super-judge . '', 
  https://euobserver.com/justice/138567 i 'm not a jurist , so you might talk to professionals about paragraphs . 
  but i trust professionals more than reddit commenters . 
  and this is why you need independent state media . 
  germany has thought of a complex , expensive system but it works . 
   georgia should be dismembered . 
  abkhazia and `` united ossetia '' ( which includes georgia 's south ossetia ) will be incorporated into russia . 
  georgia 's independent policies are unacceptable . 
   putin 's been in power for 17 years and he has n't done it . 
  he does n't want the soviet union 's territory 's back , he wants it 's global and regional influence . 
  controlling it directly or through a puppet government is the same result . 
  the gdr also was n't annexed by the soviet union , still it was de facto part of it . 
  he only cares about de facto . 
  its actions under putin have clearly shown otherwise . 
  it just does it over a timespan of several years . 
  nationalism . 
  putin needs his soviet union back . 
  this is what georgia would do if it knew it had ( military ) support from western countries . 
  but it does n't , which means that as soon as georgia fights back , it ceases to exist because russia just waits for the opportunity to annex it . 
  stop the russification of poland, 
  yeah , when russia is withdrawing its troops from georgia and ukraine , admits and apologizes for mh17 , honors the osce and actually commits itself to democracy and freedom , maybe then i 'd buy this shit . 
  you can kick and scream as much as you want , russia is using this book for its general , not me . 
  and russians following this book , not me . 
  but since it did everything that 's written in this book and uses it for its military , go stick your opinion up your ass . 
  it 's so funny , it 's virtually never an account being on reddit for 3-5 years , with posts to science or history or whatever who shows that this is just incidental . 
  nope , it 's always accounts which were made at the height of maidan or crimea crisis or when trump announced presidency , with a post history against the eu , western valid or for putin and russia , whose only argument is `` this is just crazy and totally nothing '' , while putin does his best he can since 20 years to prove that he follows this book . 
  those comments coming from the same people always shows me that i hit a bullseye . 
   never heard about it before , but this is a revelation to me that they would state their goals so openly . 
  well , nobody actually read `` mein kampf '' , either , and i think it was n't translated until the beginning of ww2 . 
  foundation of geopolitics still is n't translated into english , so of course almost nobody has read it yet - other than russian generals . 
  so how much would london have to lose _ for you _ until you consider it a smaller global financial hub than frankfurt ? 
  it looks like the confirmation bias is on your side because london loses something it had , while frankfurt gains something it had n't . 
  as the article continues right after your quote :  frankfurt has emerged as a winner of the brexit vote , with standard chartered plc , nomura holdings inc. , sumitomo mitsui financial group inc. and daiwa securities group inc. picking the city as their eu hub in recent weeks . 
  deutsche bank ag is preparing to move large parts of the trading and investment-banking assets it currently books in london to its hometown of frankfurt , people familiar with the matter said this month . 
  the article stresses that frankfurt has `` emerged as a winner '' - which directly means that london has lost something . 
   `` ukraine should be annexed by russia because `` ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning , no particular cultural import or universal significance , no geographic uniqueness , no ethnic exclusiveness , its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of eurasia and , without resolving the ukrainian problem , it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics '' . 
  ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent , unless it is cordon sanitaire , which would be inadmissible '' [ written in 1997 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) , almost everything on that list has slowly become reality . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/keep_track/comments/6m0p9o/megathread_x_chronological_summary_of_events/ he 's as much a puppet as yanukovich was . 
   it 's been nearly a year of fbi and other intelligence investigations with no substantial proof of wrong doing lol . 
  just last week trump jr admitted meeting russian spies . 
  with trump sr. admitting he knew about it . 
  and fox news anchors bursting out angrily because of all the lies , and a breitbart editor admitting in a private chat that it 's straight out collusion . 
  sorry , i wo n't play your game . 
  you know , after the last week where every day the trump campaign lied about the meeting with russian spies and was proven wrong , i have stopped playing games with 11 day old accounts . 
  yeah ... i wo n't pretend it 's not . 
  there 's a russian behind every person of this administration and for the last 150 days it was only dragged into the light . 
  whose government is controlled by the kremlin . 
  sure he does , and he is delighted by that he 's seeing . 
  who would 've thought ? 
  after licking donald trump 's butt so hard recently and trying everything to kill seperation of powers it was obvious to me that the driving force behind this must be the kremlin .
