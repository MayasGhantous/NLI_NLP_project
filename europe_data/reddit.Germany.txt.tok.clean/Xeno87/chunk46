  what in this proposal is `` similar to german '' ? 
  the justice minister dismissing supreme judges and appointing new ones ? 
  that 's not how a constitutional state works , and certainly not the german one . 
  start trolling elsewhere , totally unbiased and certainly informed redditor for ten days . 
  `` controversial '' is an understatement . 
  this abolishes the constitutional state . 
  you know , it 's amazing how your life changes once you have done actual work and have met many different people . 
  that entire teen rage , that feeling of being a total waste of human potential , the hate on everyone else because they are somehow different and better than you without even trying , that 's gone . 
  maybe you will experience this when you turn 30 and your hormones are burned up . 
  man you 14 year olds from 4chan are so easy to spot . 
  yeah i do n't believe for a second that you have ever been to germany or shanghai . 
  your entire 1 months account full of anti eu tirades and refugees completely taking over the population of europe kinda gives away that you do n't know what we are talking about here . 
  also the `` socialist nightmare '' thingy was a bit too much , you might wan na seek professional help for those fever dreams you 're having . 
  but it 's in third world countries . 
  a lot of postdocs in my department left for china and india , only to be disappointed by the living standards . 
  you 're paying those taxes in first world countries for a reason . 
  [ everything . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) when asked what he wanted to do after leading russia , he said he wanted to travel the world . 
  well , not britain , but the tories . 
  it 's funny , because putin is mimicking hitler 's tactics during the 30 's perfectly . 
  do you know what this picture is about and why it is has this name ? 
  ah yes , of course you know that those are n't children at all . 
  sure . 
  [ 28.8 % of female refugees were under the age of 4 . 
   most of `` refugees '' are adult males . 
  source ? 
  i mean , [ i got an official source stating 38 % of all refugees are women ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/452165/umfrage/asylbewerber-in-deutschland-nach-geschlecht-innerhalb-altersgruppen/ ) , but i doubt that you have anything other than a hysteric breitbart article . 
  does n't fit your narrative when 4 out of 10 refugees are women , right ? 
  that 's quite a narrow `` most '' and very close to a `` normal '' distribution . 
  the [ source for the 300k refugee children ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-09/minderjaehrige-fluechtlinge-kinder-deutschland-bundesregierung-nordrhein-westfalen ) comes from the department of interior after an inquiry of the greens party . 
  by the way , [ 28.8 % of female refugees were under the age of 4 . 
   france 94 % ( +3 ) damn . 
   this is propaganda . 
  what do you think op 's picture is ? 
   for every photo you posted there are 10 others where you have only men this is impossible since germany took in 300.000 refugee children , of which 100.000 were under the age of 6 . 
  you imply that germany then took in 3 million men alone , and that 's not even counting the women . 
  which is completely absurd , but i doubt that you have ever spoken to a refugee . 
  you blind ? 
  http://www.tagesspiegel.de/images/fluechtlinge-an-der-deutsch-oesterreichischen-grenze/12860070/1-format43.jpg all you can say is `` show me show me '' . 
  you know what you can show you ? 
  the refugee shelter in my city , or the german immigration report stating that there were 300.000 refugee children in german , 100.000 under the age of 6 . 
  get your ass out of your basement and talk to a refugee , but oh wait , you 're scared shitless of this .

  go to a refugee shelter and actually talk to them , it might change your stance . 
  but of course , you would have to leave the house and actually do something . 
   but one picture of them on the street , walking or whatever , not a picture taken in a refugee camp by some ngo . 
  op 's picture is n't like that . 
  oh yeah , sure .

  but of course , you would have to leave the house and actually do something . 
   cabinet office minister damian green said the `` basic rights '' of eu citizens living in the uk would be `` preserved '' . 
  this is a weird statement considering how there are talks about leaving the european convention on human rights . 
  oh look , the redditor for 4 months posting to t_d tells us westerners that we do n't understand russia . 
  who would 've thought . 
   and that 's with whom trump wants to fight for `` better world '' .

  oh , so that 's completely different and not soviet style at all / s, 
  no , it 's a russian puppet that 's using soviet methods .

  with paid people cheering for him . 
  this is soviet style . 
   the nazis kind of fixed it ( at least short term ) with government regulations and projects like the autobahn . 
  this is more myth than truth , but i agree with your second point - it is pretty much spot on . 
  lol , 6 years is nothing . 
  but good , you are further proving my point that versailles was n't even hard at all . 
  going from defeat to next world war should be impossible within 15 - 20 years . 
   because they stopped complying by it ? 
  `` it totally ruined the economy for decades to come , but they waged war after just 6 years '', 
  not enough to prevent it from fighting the whole.world . 
  it only took 6 years from abolishing much of the reparations to ww2 . 
  oh , am i being a bully again , huh ? 
  poor russia , getting totally undeserved criticism . 
  but was n't versaille what 's driven germany to ww2 ... ? 
  was n't that your entire point ? 
  and suddenly , loosening up escalated to ww2 ? 
  color me surprised . 
  the military restrictions were never abolished , germany just flat out ignored them and the western nations did n't enforce them , but appeased . 
  germany introduced compulsory military conscription and rebuild its armed forces in 1935 , annexed the rhineland in 1936 and anschluss 'd austria in 1938 . 
  if versaille was so bad , how could germany then start ww2 ? 
  because it was n't anything meaningful at all . 
  hyperinflation ad starving germans ? 
  that was the financial crisis , not versaille . 
  germany was bombed to absolute shit in ww2 , far worse than what versaille could have ever done , and yet it does neither seek revenge nor does the population wish back the third reich . 
  all that `` versaille was so bad '' was just nazi propaganda to lay the blame onto other countries and deflect from own mistakes . 
   many of the countries that became free are n't excactly doing well either . 
  standards of living now are not comparable to soviet ones . 
  i totally agree . 
  do n't sugarcoat this - when someone said `` the dissolution of the soviet union was a mistake '' he 's saying `` i wish my country was a dictatorship ruled by a russian puppet '' . 
  this is treason , nothing less , and it 's the result of putin propaganda . 
  40 years of enslavement vs a few years of economic problems . 
  how dare i prefer the freedom of several hundred million people over the economic well being of 100 million . 
  in the worst way for russia .
