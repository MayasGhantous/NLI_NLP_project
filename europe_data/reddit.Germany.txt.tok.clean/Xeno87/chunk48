  he 's controlling the media and kills or imprisons his critics , his approval rating is just as fake as the soviet leader ones . 
  so you 're saying we should just lay on our backs and do nothing about russia attacking us ? 
  no matter what troubles russia might have with a regime change , we are not udner attack anymore . 
  not for us . 
  but but but muh usa, 
  oh , but we should let him meddle in our politics ? 
  because what ? 
  what is he going to do ? 
  attack ukraine ? 
  attack georgia ? 
  flood us with propaganda ? 
  hack our elections , parliaments and aprties ? 
  assassinate critics ? 
  if we want him to stop something , we must do the same to him . 
   point is that things will get worse first . 
  we should n't wait for this . 
  this continent has suffered enough from dictators , this time we should act early . 
  someone in a country he attacks . 
  you know , nobody would have a problem with russia if it stayed in its borders . 
  oh - i thought you meant his successor could get worse than putin . 
  but you meant _ putin _ can still get worse , did n't you ? 
  yeah , sadly , i think you 're right . 
  did n't get worse in germany after hitler , in italy after mussolini , in russia after stalin , in spain after franco . 
  and they were all removed from power differently . 
  i 'll take the risk . 
  what is his successor gon na do ? 
  wage war against his neighbors , financing nazis and extremists , assassinate critics in other countries , flooding democratic countries with propaganda , laundering money and running a country-wide mafia operation ? 
  we already have that . 
  i bet his successor will just be someone who wants money and would n't give a shit about killing democracy . 
  also less smart , because dictators never surround themselves with people msarter than them . 
  * while . 
   and what he is doing exactly ? 
  not taking the b8 m8, 
  i know . 
  germany imported ~ 20 % of its oil and gas from russia in 1990 . 
  while also working towards a regime change in russia . 
  putin has reigned long enough , time for some change . 
  ca n't get any worse than this . 
  not enough . 
  my own country , through a chancellor of my party , has made europe dependent on russian oil and gas . 
  the russian mob has successfully infiltrated a major political party in my country through financial dependence . 
  and this same chancellor , who certified putin as a `` flawless democrat '' , is now back and trying further to strengthen the economic , financial and material dependence on russia . 
  the banks in my city , deutsche bank before all else , have been laundering russian mob money for years . 
  seriously , our whole continent is being taken over by one of the smartest dictators ever . 
  however , being smart does n't stop him from being just as evil , hateful and cruel as the rest . 
  only ten days after he referred to ukraine as [ `` the territories now called ukraine '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-ukraine-russia-territories-nato-crimea-annexation-rebels-miltants-borders-a7791951.html ), 
  good , then you should know about other countries laws concerning incitement of violence . 
  for example , [ encouraging or assisting a crime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encouraging_or_assisting_a_crime_in_english_law ) in english law or [ imminent lawless action ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imminent_lawless_action ) in the us legal system . 
  and now i 'm wondering , if i was to check out your comment history for your political leaning , would you be one of those people who ask `` why has n't the police done anything against those islamist hate preachers '' ? 
  man , you have never even left your country , did n't you ? 
  yes . 
  because inciting violence against groups is also a crime . 
  even if you incite violence against nazis . 
  glorifying nationalsocialsm , denying the holocaust or inciting violence against ethnic groups is a crime in germany since 1959 . 
  if you did that in a newspaper comment or somewhere else in public , you were faced with legal action . 
  this has n't had any negative influence on german society or freedom of speech at all . 
  the only thing that has changed is that this was n't enforced in the same way on facebook postings so far . 
  now it is . 
   anyway apart from that , the hundreds of thousands of refugees are from the few hospitals bombed in aleppo ? 
  we were arguing about the cause for the hundreds of thousands of refugees . 
  `` oh hey , they bombed the hospital to shit , but well , who cares , let 's just stay here , we 'll totally be safe when they come ! '', 
  man you must be pretty out of touch with real life . 
  does china also bomb hospitals and refugee camps ? 
  i know who has something to do with the hundreds of thousands of refugees . 
  it 's the guy who blocked every international effort for syria with his un veto . 
  or let 's his airforce target hospitals and refugee camps . 
   why do you think that ? 
  because every populist right wing party sucks his dick . 
  because they all somehow get funding from the kremlin . 
  because they all went to crimea as `` observers '' . 
  and no , those parties may have existed , but they were n't as strong as today . 
  especially germany was basically free of such an established party , but even that has changed . 
  they all get help , funding , resources , shelter from russia . 
  putin is spreading his ideology through them . 
  must be fake . 
  putin is n't kissing little boys . 
  i wonder how europe would look like if putin had never achieved power . 
  georgia and ukraine would look completely different for sure , but i 'm also convinced that there would be a lot less populist right-wing parties in europe . 
  i 'd argue that it 's not only colloquial , but synonymous . 
   is there an out of whack copyright section in this treaty ? 
  was there in ttip ? 
  oh right , there was n't because there was n't even a completed draft . 
  now pay attention about the lack of outrage compared to the eu-canada or eu-us free trade agreements . 
   in the vote , 43 meps voted against girling 's objections , eight voted in favour and seven abstained . 
  is there a way to find out who voted in favor of this ? 
  * edit * : it is not up yet , but we will be able to look into the voting results [ here ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/envi/votes-in-committee.html ) in the future . 
  apparently , there are enough airspace violations that bulgaria calls it a [ provocation ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-russia-nato-airspace-iduskcn1040je ) . 
  it would be [ stupid ] ( http://img.zeit.de/politik/2017-06/helmut-kohl-bill-clinton/wide__820x461__desktop ) as [ hell ] ( http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-215062-galleryv9-lzrg-215062.jpg ) if clinton did n't attend . 
  exactly , because how can we better underscore the paneuropean spirit by playing music by a racist and antimsemite ? 
  i 'm fine with that as long as they play [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmnbqrbfhb0 ) right before the transmission . 
  now look at this thread and compare it to one of those other terrorist attacks in london . 
  see why this thread is quieter , more civilised , and not upvoted several thousands of times ? 
  there are right wing terrorists on this website aggressively pushing their narrative and brigading . 
  [ even the 1 million figure is bullshit . 
  ] ( https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/ukraine-rejects-polish-million-refugees-claim/ ) there were only 14.000 applications for asylum in the eu by ukrainian refugees , and only about 3000 in germany . 
  frankly , fuck putins russia and fuck our appeasing politicians . 
  fuck schr\u00f6der and his gazprom mafia . 
   police recorded 22,880 traffic violations by diplomats last year alone . 
  just to give some details : [ in 2014 there were 23.403 ] ( https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article137116067/diplomaten-begehen-immer-mehr-verkehrsverstoesse.html ) traffic violations , of which 49 were traffic accidents . 
  [ in 2016 there were 22.816 violations with 58 accidents .
