  ah yes the classic . 
  `` laws do n't apply to everyone '' . 
   we have taken a million ukrainian refugees , they do n't count though right , not exotic enough for furher merkel and the lunatic left eh ? 
  i 'm sure you can take another 1092 one without collapsing . 
   why would we leave , we receive plenty of financial benefits from the eu . 
  `` we want benefits , but if we have to help solving problems , we do n't want to do our fair share '' . 
  who would 've thought that other countries will use all their legal possibilities to pursue their interests then ? 
  that 's not forcing . 
  forcing them onto poland means actually bringing them there . 
  we are just using our legal possibilities to pursue our interests . 
  poland currently does the same - it does not accept refugees , and for that , must face the consequences of its decision . 
  yeah , you see , and since we ca n't force those refugees onto poland , we theatened it with sanctions for not complying with eu policy . 
  so do n't cry when we do . 
  yeah , you know , i 'm still surprised that in a union with majority votes and veto 's all over the place , there are still people who think they can blame one single person for problems . 
   1m african migrants ** may be ** en route to europe , says former uk envoy one guy says `` may be '' . 
  hundreds of other guys say `` nope '' . 
  and then : [ the 2015/2016 crisis was not caused by african asylum seekers ] ( https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/8cf7/production/_88578063_chart_top10_origins_of_asylum_seekers_2015.jpg ) . 
  i doubt that anything has changed in the last years , there is n't a big civil war in africa going on like there is in syria . 
  if you are concernd by asylum seekers , african asylum seekers should be your least worry . 
  [ even in 2016 the summer-bump was pretty small ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/fa/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_eu-28%2c_january_2015_%e2%80%93_december_2016.png ) . 
  now it 's june already and we have n't seen anything big already . 
  the eu-turkey deal works pretty well . 
   there is n't a point to agreeing until the migrant inflow is 0 oh dear , if amazon would do this approach . 
  `` there is n't a point in processing orders until the inflow of new orders is 0 '' . 
  i 'd say the biggest problem is that there so far is not a single eurobond proposal that not directly violates article 125 . 
  but yeah , i mean , even if the german government did n't like eurobonds , what should it do against it if they are implemented ? 
  the german government could take it to the european court of justice , but if it suffers a defeat there , it has to comply or face sanctions . 
  it would be exaclty the same situation as here - a country does not comply to agreements it agreed to and get sanctioned for it . 
   majority of foreigners decided that other foreigners can and should move to poland and hungary ? 
  that sounds like a dictatorship or the 4th reich . 
  * you apprently do n't know much about the 3th reich * you apparently do n't know much about the refugee distribution agreement * you apparently do n't know much about the competences your countries agreed to give to the eu * if polish and hungarian culture will die because of 5082 and 1294 refugees respectively , i guess your countries were n't stable enough for the eu anyways . 
   you think germany or brussels has some divine right to impose their will upon others ? 
  poland and hungary agreed to accept eu majority decision . 
  should n't have joined the eu then when you dont actually like that . 
  if you can get a majority for that , why not ? 
  yeah well guess we will do that then . 
   we should accept no muslim refugees in the future and no matter how much the eu will force us to do so then leave the eu . 
  the majority has decided , if you do n't comply with that , a democratic union is n't for you . 
  oh dear , yeah , majority decisions are going to destroy democracy / s, 
   what 's the point of distribution if there are thousands more coming every week ? 
  [ what 's the point in discussing this when it is n't true ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/sea_arrivals_to_greece_and_italy%2c_2015.png ) refugee crisis has peaked in 2015 and is almost over now . 
  also redistribution should happen as soon as possible , we ca n't leave just a few countries doing all the work . 
  burning a book is so absurd in its entirety that it does not take much more to commit real crimes after this . 
  you sure need to be one hateful idiot to do this . 
  there 's a reason why all fucked up regimes and people ordered book burnings - the nazis , the soviets , greek dictator metaxas , mccarty , the maoists in china , pol pot , pinochet , serbs in the bosnian war , the taliban in afghanistan . 
  burning something is pretty symbolic and a big thing for humans . 
  if you burn a book , you have left civilization and have become feral . 
   edgy shit here calling this quote in this context `` edgy '' is pretty bold . 
  also , that statement refers to a quran burning by the spanish during the conquest of granada . 
  facebook and youtube are open communities and central parts of our society . 
  posting a video of burning a quran there should be treated like burning one in a public area . 
   burning a religious book is a dick move , but i dont think it is something to be prosecuted for . 
  [ i disagree . 
  ] ( http://www.taz.de/picture/161558/948/39247043.jpg ) it starts with burning books and ends with burning people . 
   i did n't want to go to vote because meh \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
   they could cut it , they could make it return false information , they could decrease the precision those are my concerns . 
  there 's another country that gets a [ rebate ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_rebate ) ? 
  seriously , i bet my ass he pays people to push that `` george soros '' - meme and shit to distract from himself . 
  nice , i ca n't wait to finally have this thing . 
  i do n't wan na have to use gps or glonass as long as there are trump 's and putin 's . 
  and china is a bit ... suspect . 
  and there is a 100km demilitarized puffer zone between ukraine and russia - on the russian side of the border . 
  i sure hope not . 
  the uk has so many special snowflake deals and rights and i certainly do n't want them to keep that . 
  i want the uk to pay its fair share and have exactly the same rights and obligations like any other member state . 
  ukraine can get into eu once russia gets out of ukraine . 
  i got 20gb from o2, 
   implying i 'm talking about immigration seriously , it 's like you people do n't know of anything else . 
  seeing that russia is still denying this , is still occupying huge parts of ukraine , . makes my blood boil . 
  fuck putin , that annoying cunt in the kremlin is due for polonium tea . 
  my god just bugger off and be miserable somewhere else . 
  `` literally hitler '' . 
  lol . 
  get rid of putin , then we might talk about german chancellors , governments , coalitions and parliaments . 
  [ the council of europe does not agree .

  too dumb to do what you signed ? 
  you can of course still ask russia if they want to annex you . 
  no , that 's stuff you sign when becoming a member of the eu . 
  poland and hungary are not holding up democratic and eu standards . 
  this should be sanctioned .

   have an edgy following to whom any line of thought other than theirs can only be perpetuated by sheeple . 
  ... you are perfectly describing t_d right now . 
   his comments come after mrs may defended her record on police cuts amid increasing pressure over a 20,000 drop in the number of officers on the streets in the last six years . 
  what the hell , that 's basically begging for bad stuff to happen . 
   funny how everyone loved wikileaks when it was exposing shit like iraq war crimes now it 's russian fake news because it exposed the dnc that 's because in 2010 they had immense [ funding problems when paypal suspended their account ] ( https://www.wired.com/2010/12/paypal-wikileaks/ ) .
