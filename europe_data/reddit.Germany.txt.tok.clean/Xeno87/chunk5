  wait , let me get this straight : because turkey ( allegedly ) operates in isis territory , reddit pretends that `` turkey is literally isis '' ? 
  or i 'm trolling people that try to use emotions where others use their brain . 
  people who never met a refugee crying about `` hundreds of millions '' to come are n't worth the effort of a real discussion since they lack the necessary background information . 
  * nobody said that here , we 're all pointing out the fact that the current attacks mostly go for kurds * there were many suspicious activities between isis and erdogans turkey , including weapons deliveries and oil tankers * [ self explanatory ] ( http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/erdogan-ottoman.jpg ), 
  can you prove that turkey attacks isis ? 
  exactly . 
  it never happened like you want it to have happened . 
  fufnact : all that shit you said never happened and will never happen . 
  talk shit , get shit thrown back at you, 
  yeah . 
  or when poland in the 90 's / early 2000 's scare mongered about germans buying back all former german regions , or the alleged romanian/hungarian `` economic refugees '' swarming over germany . 
  sometimes it 's like 50 % of the population ( and 95 % of conservative politicians ) never attended school . 
  but then again , this was said about europe , too . 
  no reason to believe it will always continue . 
   it 's funny to watch people like you from their moral high horse chastising people as racists and xenophobes which they are . 
  you know , this is n't my first refugee crisis and i 'm also not scared of others , which is way i can mantain my cool on this topic . 
  i know this is crisis going to end , i know this is n't the end of the world , i know that i 'm not threatened by msulims and i know that not the entire middle east will come here since ** nobody wants to leave home ** . 
  which is what you , yes , xenophobes ca n't even realize since you are too busy scaremongering yourself - that refugees are jsut a mere fraction of the people who leave their home country , while 90 % of the rest stays at home because they do n't want to leave their home . 
  no event ever has lead to a full , 100 % migration of a population out of its home region , his is n't how humanity works . 
  actually , 90 % of humanity rather stays and lives in the deepest shithole that is possible solely because they are scared to leave their known place . 
  oh , also , if i do n't refute something it 's because i do n't want to . 
  ofc you get a weak response when you piss yourself over two million people that came in over 4 years and call this the end of the world . 
  hundreds of millions ? 
  well at that rate it would take 200 years for that . 
  `` the entire middle east is going to run us over '' - my god , how pathetic must one be to believe that . 
  no shit , and do you think the reason the numbers of yugoslavian refugees went down was due to the end of the war ? 
  [ this shit continued until 2001 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars ) , while the peak of the yugoslavian refugee crisis was in 1994 !, 
  we closed our borders back then just as we did today . 
  seriously , this is what i was speaking of - people not even knowing what the fuck happened merely 20 years ago . 
  we had ** all ** of this shit before , we discussed it before , and the result is always the same . 
   hence we may as well be speaking of hundreds of millions . 
  and this is very i already ca n't take you seriously anymore . 
  what a pathetic scaremongering bogus argument . 
  if you have n't noticed , number of refugees went down a shitload in 2016 , we already had the peak . 
  your `` hudnreds ofmillions '' are in the order of two million , which is exactly comparable to the yugoslavia crisis . 
   easier to integrate . 
  that 's not what you shitheads tried telling me in ' 94 . 
  it was `` they 're foreigners '' just like you say now . 
  you do n't give a rats ass about `` culture '' . 
   possibility of deportation every war ends , no war goes on forever . 
  and even if we 're `` stuck '' - 1 million people are no problem . 
   gender balance . 
  i do n't know yeah , that 's the problem . 
  lem me guess , you know so little that you ca n't even date the yugoslavia refugee crisis , right ? 
  god i 'm sick of alwas seeing the same shit . 
  it 's exactly the same as during the yugoslavia refugee crisis , when the `` republicans '' ( republikaner ) and dvu became big , and threatened our democracy . 
  the goddamn same shit i read today was said back then and it was already wrong back then . 
  it 's like people neither have memory nor history books . 
   either way , we need some real authority [ ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/paris_tuileries_garden_facepalm_statue.jpg ), 
  let 's raise the new fifth column, 
  ca n't have fascism without a ( pseudo - ) religious cult . 
  you should watch it , casablanca is one of the best movies ever made . 
  it 's about refugees from europe in ww2 , get stranded in casablanca ( french territory in africa ) , desperately trying to get a ticket to the usa . 
  so many idioms originate from that movie - `` here 's looking at you , kid '' , `` the usual suspects '' ... 
  it was originally intended to let the nazis sing the horst wessel lied in that scene . 
  however , since it was copyrighted , they changed it to die wacht am rein . 
   my god , think of the consequences wish your random people would do that, 
  if i read `` british military mobilizes '' today i 'd get antsy as fuck . 
  yeah , i can read the article . 
  because this story here shows pretty good what happens when people with a fixed mind set only seek news to confirm it . 
  the article clearly states in the beginning : _ `` nach spiegel-informationen '' _ . 
  everyone who consumes serious news in a daily basis then knows to take this news with a grain of salt _ until confirmed _ , and therefore discusses it in this very matter - as an unconfirmed , but plausible thing . 
  but the same people who discussed it here , instantly , as a completely true story without waiting for confirmation , are the same people who instantly jump to conclusions when the first news of a terroristic attack comes in . 
  instead of fucking waiting for confirmation about unconfirmed news , they treat it as written into stone , while other people wait until they have definite confirmation before they start talking . 
  ** this ** is the difference between people that take facts and form an opinion , and the others . 
   scape-gallows who destroyed their country and europe in the process of murdering , raping and plundering . 
  are we talking about putins russia again ? 
  aside from the fact that boo'ing during a national anthem is pretty cunty ( well , in war times we might allow it ) , but why the hell would you boo the marseillaise ?? 
  [ that 's basically the coolest anthem ever !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktsg9i6lvqu&amp;t=1m2s ), 
  `` freie presse , german '' : * main headline : `` germany 's proposal for negotiations with britain '' * minor headline `` the construction of air-raid trenches '' . 
  the three centered headlines in `` posener tageblatt , german '' read : * `` england 's answer handed over in berlin '' * `` military defense order '' * `` workers union for polish coal industry '' the small headline on the top left of `` posener tageblatt '' says : * '' ( the ) threat to poland by slovakia '' ca n't make out the small fonts though . 
  some people take facts and form an opinion , others take an opinion and form facts . 
   no , i come with arguments ca n't see any . 
  you are crying about senators/parliamentarian being able to read a treaty _ while in negotiations _ , which normally is n't even a given . 
  you know , usually , treaties are negotiated , and _ then _ the parliaments get several months of time to read , discuss and improve the treaty . 
  you can thank the soviet union for that . 
  according to the [ potsdam agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potsdam_agreement ) , the victorious powers were in charge of settling the reparation question . 
  [ the west did so ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/london_agreement_on_german_external_debts ) . 
  [ also , you do n't like that whole eu thing ? 
  ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-frmxt-8nwtc/vzeawmwzgki/aaaaaaaadem/ifpj7wo8cry/s1600/net%2bcontribution%2beu.gif ) it is the stance of the german government and usually , the other eu governments as well , that germany 's contribution to the eu more than makes up for reparations . 
  because the money flow via eu is much , _ much _ higher than reperation claims . 
  also , legally , all reparation talks is done due to the 2 +4 treaty . 
  it is not my job to explain stuff to you , it is ** your ** duty to inform yourself if you want to open your mouth . 
  if you do n't know , very , very detailed , how things are done in politics and negotiations , and you do n't want to reasearch it , then shut up and let people who do research do their job . 
  and do n't get pissed when you write a comment criticizing nothing in detail and do n't get a detailed refutation . 
  finding out ? 
  they were the first to know that they shot it down . 
  why is it so hard for you people to research how things work . 
  i see , ignoring the opinion of people who actually know what they are talking about is the new edgy thing to do . 
   instead , we had people who do n't know how negotiations work here , this applies to you . 
  i 'm damn sure you ca n't even answer who negotiates for whom with a mandate , just as you do n't know how and why trade deals are negotiated in secret . 
   it would still be largely disadvantageous towards the eu then show what lines you are talking about . 
  even though economics is n't my specialty at all , i 'm committed to read into that . 
  also :  which they wo n't , there are many key points that the us wo n't change you do realize that the us is negotiating against 26 countries at once ? 
  playing the tough , immobile negotiator is a strategy . 
  seriously , no . 
  i do n't want them to stop . 
  the entire internet has told me that this trade deal , _ which has n't even passed negotiations _ , is anti democratic and anti-whatnot and that `` the politicians '' do n't care about `` us the people '' and that the `` big industry '' will `` enslave us '' and ruin everything . 
  i want them to give those people what they called for .
