   german media 's avoidance of discussing immigrant crimes is pretty bullshit , yes . 
  too bad it 's widespread . 
  top tier proof . 
  go troll elsewhere . 
  holy hell yes !, 
  but beware , links to rt will get your comment removed here . 
  oh , you learned from the [ bestest one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uavwretr4jg ) . 
   `` the attacker had been previously reported/monitored by the police for months '' yes , and as long as you want to live in a country where laws matter , you ca n't jail someone for that . 
  and when you vote for idiots that cut 20.000 police jobs , do n't cry when there is not enoguh staff to monitor properly . 
   do nothing so other than abolishing rule of law and jailing people not convicted of a crime in a court , what do you propose ? 
  i 'm sure the redditor for three months , shilling for alt-reich can come up with anything different than camps , closed borders for whoever minority he does n't like or other unconstitutional shit . 
  repost because comment was removed for linking to rt :  in other words ; about as much as sz , or any german media , has to say about immigrant crime . 
  lol , what bullshit . 
   if you have an issue with their leaks just disprove any of their leaked content and you 'll have an actual argument to go with your salt . 
  found the russian shill . 
  you know , i have a problem with their leaked content : [ the one where they pretend ukraine shot down mh17 ] ( https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/492033939142619136 ) . 
  but i even have more problems with their ** not ** leaked conent , the one about russia that was never leaked , but [ ** sold ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel_shamir#association_with_wikileaks ) . 
  -------------------------------------- [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5yga71/wikileaks_is_an_agent_of_russia_in_effect/depsmh8/ ) by / u/woxat : wikileaks claims it 's an organization to hold those with power accountable and promote transparency but they have n't produced any leaks of russia . 
  assange says they do n't cover russia for two reasons ; no one there speaks russian , and because russia has such a free and empowered critical press : https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/24/julian-assange-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-interview except press freedom has plummeted in the 16 years putin including 10x the number of journalists murdered compared to other countries , and almost always those critical to the kremlin : http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2016/jan/04/does-vladimir-putin-kill-journalists/ the lack of russian-speaking staff sounds kinda plausible though until you find out that early on in the history of wikileaks , assange denied a us focus and said they would be targetting russia and china as well : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/julian-assange-wikileaks-china-russia in fact , assange personally claimed to have a bombshell release on russia : http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2010/1026/wikileaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-russia.-but-will-russians-get-to-read-about-it however , we 'll never know what that was because it was never released after russia obliquely threatened assange : http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/11/01/russias-fsb-to-wikileaks-we-could-destroy-you/ whatever ultimately happened , the two sides must have made up fast because they 've been they 've been working together ever since . 
  in fact , assange was literally hosting a show on the russian state propaganda channel the following year : [ link redacted ] wikileaks on the panama papers via their friends at rt : [ link redacted ] -------------------------------------------------------------------- so if you try to divert from the fact that wikileaks is a piece of shit , trying to play down the panama papers because they hurt their boss putin , bugger off . 
  well it 's wikileaks , russian desinformation . 
  i wonder what our marvelous democrats from wikileaks have to say about that ... [ oh ... ] ( http://imgur.com/i706bos ), 
  her numbers crashed because corbyn dealt better with the attacks than may . 
  now she has a second chance to try better . 
   many will vote her out after the first attack , her poll numbers crashed . 
  what if this time the exact opposite happens ? 
   this is her reichstag fire . 
  it is remarkable that such an attack occured so quickly _ again _ . 
  uusually , when such an attack happens , there does n't happen anything again in the same location because of the fear of too much security still being there . 
  this is really different from what usually happens . 
  and i believe the exact opposite - what he did was wrong _ and _ he is a traitor . 
  because he did not only disclose what the nsa was doing ( which was morally justified in my opinion ) , no he also gave other secrets , which he did n't leak to the public , to china . 
  / u/nowhathappenedwas made a fantastic [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/53h3hz/dont_just_pardon_edward_snowden_give_the_man_a/d7t6z3a/ ) about that : ----------------------------- exposing a crime is an excellent argument for a pardon . 
  snowden 's initial leak showed that the us was intercepting and collecting metadata on virtually every domestic phone call . 
  courts have struck that down as illegal , and congress voted to change the law once it came to light . 
  this is whistleblowing at its finest . 
  but snowden did n't just leak information about illegal or unpopular domestic spying programs . 
  the vast majority of his ( published ) leaks were about legal , popular foreign spying operations . 
  this includes the us spying on allies , enemies , and everything in between . 
  it also includes us intelligence about foreign countries spying on each other . 
  americans , and congress , support the vast majority of international surveillance . 
  and there 's nothing illegal -- much less unconstitutional , about foreign surveillance . 
  leaking classified information just because you personally disagree with a program is not whistleblowing , and the government can not function if it allows its employees to sabotage any program they dislike . 
  snowden is accused of violating the [ espionage act ] ( http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793 ) , not for treason , which applies to :  ** whoever , lawfully having possession of ** , access to , control over , or being entrusted with any document , writing , code book , signal book , sketch , photograph , photographic negative , blueprint , plan , map , model , instrument , appliance , or note relating to the national defense , or *** information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the united states or to the advantage of any foreign nation , willfully communicates *** , delivers , transmits or causes to be communicated , delivered , or transmitted or attempts to communicate , deliver , transmit or cause to be communicated , delivered or transmitted *** the same to any person not entitled to receive it *** , or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the united states entitled to receive it ; now why would the us think that snowden is giving information to foreign countries that could be used to the advantage of those countries and/or to the injury of the us ? 
  oh , right , because snowden claims that he took the booz allen job to gain access information about specific foreign computers the nsa was hacking so that he could give that information to foreign journalists to publish . 
  [ snowden on his plans ] ( http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1268209/exclusive-snowden-sought-booz-allen-job-gather-evidence-nsa?login=1 ) :  `` my position with booz allen hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the nsa hacked . 
  that is why i accepted that position about three months ago . 
  if i have time to go through this information , i would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment , independent of my bias , as to whether or not the knowledge of us network operations against their people should be published . '' [ what snowden gave china while he was in hong kong , which is likely what he wants to do for other countries ] ( http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all ) :  classified us government data shown to the south china morning post by whistle-blower edward snowden has provided a rare insight into the effectiveness of washington 's top-secret global cyberspying programme ...   ... the detailed records - which can not be independently verified - *** show specific dates and the ip addresses of computers in hong kong and on the mainland hacked by the national security agency over a four-year period *** . 
    they also include information indicating whether an attack on a computer was ongoing or had been completed , along with an amount of additional operational information . 
  [ glenn greenwald on june 25 ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html ) :  greenwald said he would not have published some of the stories that ran in the south china morning post . 
  `` whether i would have disclosed the specific ip addresses in china and hong kong the nsa is hacking , i do n't think i would have , '' greenwald said . 
  `` *** what motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of hong kong and china . 
  *** '' [ glenn greenwald on july 2 ] ( https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/352213748917874688 ) :  i think there 's a difference between what really motivated him to leak & what he 's leaked out of self-preservation so even greenwald agrees that the later leaks are not whistleblowing . 
  leaking classified and sensitive operational information to the chinese to `` ingratiate himself to the people of hong kong and china '' may not be treason or spying , but it 's certainly not whistleblowing . 
  here 's famed [ nsa whistleblower william binney ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/06/16/snowden-whistleblower-nsa-officials-roundtable/2428809/ ) discussing the difference between the domestic whistleblowing and the leaking of foreign surveillance targets :  q : there 's a question being debated whether snowden is a hero or a traitor . 
    binney : certainly he performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they 're doing . 
  at least now they are going to have some kind of open discussion like that . 
    ** but now he is starting to talk about things like the government hacking into china and all this kind of thing . 
  he is going a little bit too far . 
  i do n't think he had access to that program . 
  but somebody talked to him about it , and so he said , from what i have read , anyway , he said that somebody , a reliable source , told him that the u.s. government is hacking into all these countries . 
  but that 's not a public service , and now he is going a little beyond public service . 
  **  ** so he is transitioning from whistle-blower to a traitor . 
  to underline how the us administration is just making shit up . 
  oh , how terrible , i 'm dismissing any opposition . 
  it 's almost as if i 'm acting just like every other trumpist or people who declined to vote hillary . 
  there are just two kinds of people : those who want to actually target problems , and those who want to split in liberals faces . 
  oh woe is me , people have to actually be responsible for what they share . 
  it 's almost like i 'm facing the same threat . 
  yeah , i wo n't play your pretending game . 
  those people are either paid to shitpost or have alts to spam , nothing more . 
  woah woah woah woah ... nobody said anything about shooting ... you know the second amendment people have big _ lobbying _ you know ... 
  nothing you can do folks ... except the second amendment people , i dunno . 
  so how long until orban or kaczynski try to use bilateral trade deals to blackmail the rest of the union ? 
  almost every reddit account that was made after trump announced to run for president and that is defending trump is not worth the effort . 
  they do n't have a fixed set of rules they seem good or bad , they do n't really believe in anything . 
  they bend their worldview as much as they like just to defend trump or the us , russia or the current goal . 
  they criticize one user for one thing and gratulate another for it at the same time , they paint one person as responsible for the actions of everybody else or the opposite . 
  their entire purpose is to derail any debate and distract . 
  you compare an entire country over the course of more than 100 years to one guy in just less than 300days . 
  really shows you htat `` trump is literally hitler '' is n't that far off . 
   we do n't have some aspiration for perpetual european dominance like you guys and unlike you apprently , i 'm not leader of my country . 
   the text was amended several times in an effort to appease the brits and remove any suggestion that this was an eu military hq . 
  `` the uk drops objections to 30 man army unit in brussels '' should be the headline . 
  this unit only plans non executive missions . 
  the article even talks about that the uk is still in complete opposition to an eu army :  for some countries , including germany , france and italy , the mpcc is exactly what the u.k. does n't want -- a small step toward a centralized eu military base . 
  [ `` britain will veto eu army ''  ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-will-veto-eu-army-says-defence-secretary-a7313081.html )  `` that is not going to happen . 
  we are full members of the eu and we will go on resisting any attempt to set up a rival to nato . '', 
  the uk , already losing influence because of brexit , does not want a rival to nato because that would weaken its influence on europe even more . 
   our countries are finally starting to open their mouths to the us . 
  seeing how our countries dealt with russia attacking and annexing our trading partners , funding our extremists or hacking our elections i doubt that there will be actual consequences to the us being lead by a republican . 
  all this is normal republican policy , abd our leaders speak out not because of those policies , but because of trumps attitude about it . 
  yeah but you fail to appreciate the historic context : germany was occupied until _ 1990 _ . 
  the bundeswehr did n't have a mission outside of germany until that , and only in 1994 the supreme court decided that this is legal . 
  this wo n't go well between the uk and eu . 
  that 's the `` russian tourist '' thing he said about ukraine . 
  he 's just rubbing it into our faces , knowing that we wo n't do anything . 
  i thought the xenophobia , racism , discrimination of religious minorities , sexism , sexual assault , treason , calls for violence , lying , obstruction of justice was crossing a line . 
  well , nope , it was n't , so climate change denial wo n't do it , either . 
  because nobody holds him or his supporters accountable .
