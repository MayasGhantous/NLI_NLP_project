  it 's not like there are n't any other duties for soldiers other than being cannon fodder . 
  so , is n't this equivalent to a death penalty ? 
  it was realized way too late . 
  we should have gone full embargo in 2009 , we should have immediately took hard measures in ukraine - instead we 're sitting on our asses , watching how he pays our extremists and makes them win elections . 
  tough talk wo n't impress him , he only understand brutal force . 
   also , as far as i know we are n't really doing anything in the middeast right now . 
  well there 's still nato in afghanistan , russia bombing syria to shit , with the us also bombing iraq and syria . 
  when the nyt is n't conservative for you , you fell off the right political spectrum . 
   we shall be conservative , in all cases where we think conservatism essential to the public good ; -- and we shall be radical in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform . 
  we do not believe that everything in society is either exactly right or exactly wrong ; -- what is good we desire to preserve and improve ; -- what is evil , to exterminate , or reform . 
  not good , but the best you can make out of the situation . 
  the intel was shared for specific reasons - aka finding out more about the backgrounds , complices etc. 
  the us sure has useful information and methods to gain said information . 
  not sharing this stuff means harder investigations for the british police . 
  but i agree , you ca n't trust that goverment . 
  you ca n't work with it . 
  good joke . 
   i find these leaks bizarre , especially as they are reportedly coming from us law enforcement - who would have anything to gain from leaking this information ? 
  when your government consists of white supremacists who want to spark hatred against religious minorities , you have something to gain from being the first one to report that the attacker belongs to said minority . 
  even if the person to leak it was just thinking `` i told you so '', 
   maybe people would stop associating gypsy with thieves if russians would stop attacking and annexing other countries and living in shit , maybe people would stop assosiating russians with shit . 
  oh wait , nobody does this because we can differentiate between criminal thugs and normal people . 
  but apparently , only when it 's russians , ever other ethnicity is almost free for genocide on / r/europe . 
  definitely not culture , but criminals . 
  if it was culutre , they would be willing to do it . 
  nah , putin just wants some of that awesome d\u00f6ner kebab, 
  guess why putin is friends with erdogan ? 
   gypsies have a weird culture that not many know about . 
  crime is okay in their books and we 're suckers for letting it happen . 
  ca n't believe such shit is upvoted on / r/europe , it 's like stormfront is brigading this . 
  try reading the article :  ** the skilled young burglars ** , prized for their discretion and lower chance of being jailed , ** were traded between the various families ** , reinhold bergmann , the commissioner for organized burglary crime , said in a statement . 
   ** `` they have no choice but to participate , '' ** bergmann told the german newspaper s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung . 
  man they sure had awesome cameras in 1130 . 
   because the last 8 years did n't happen , and obama just locked himself in a closet in the white house . 
  he is black , that 's all this is about . 
  god i wish i could rub this in every brexiteers face . 
  but they probably would defend it . 
  if a polish government does not accept eu laws it will feel repercussions and maybe lose its membership , simple as that . 
  putin always seems so thirsty to me . 
  he should drink some polonium tea . 
  quite right . 
  but putin mentioned those regions in pretty much the same context , which is why i put it that way . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.unian.info/world/111033-text-of-putins-speech-at-nato-summit-bucharest-april-2-2008.html ) is his full speech about that . 
  i 'd school you , but i already stated my point . 
  just imagine i said something and hold an imaginary discussion . 
  yes , how dare those countries think they can decide for themselves ? 
  they must always do as big brother russia says !, 
  [ let 's jump to stage 5 already , i 'm tired of this bullshit . 
  during the 2008 bucharest nato summit he stated that if georgia and ukraine would be accepted into nato , the russian populated regions in those countries ( south ossetia , abkhazia , eatsern ukraine ) would breakt away and join russia , something every analyst back then interpreted as what it was - a clear and open threat of military intervention . 
  france , gb and germany veto 'd their application request out of respect for russian concerns . 
  a year later a war between georgia and russia broke out , and mysteriously , the regions south ossetia and abkhazia claimed independence . 
  putin got away with georgia , he got away with crimea , he got away with eastern ukraine , he got away with trump . 
  he seemingly gets a free pass on everything he does . 
  `` the uk and france are to blame for not doing anything vs nazi germany . 
  but russia , helping nazi germany , dividing poland and eastern europe with them for years , no poor russia is completely innocent . 
  how dare you be so russiaphobic '' all your bullshit about `` historical consensus '' is just your personal , twisted opinion . 
  your are making me sick . 
   the historical consensus is that the british/french policy of appeasement and german pursuit of lebensraum caused ww2 . 
  well good that you outed yourself , because now your intentions are completely clear . 
  not much more and you blame poland for getting divided . 
  the uk and france declaring war against nazi germany for attacking poland = appeasement . 
  they are to blame for everything else . 
  russia attacking poland with nazi germany and dividing europe with them = stop being so russiaphobic . 
  no , that 's what you constantly try to imply . 
  i 'm talking about `` russia '' and `` soviet union '' . 
  the only individuals i even want to blame are those who , voluntarily , defend and try to whitewash the historic barbarism , or think that anyone `` owes '' russia anything . 
  if russia would 've helped defeating nazi germany , then it would have redeemed itself from starting ww2 toegether with it . 
  nope , instead it enslaved eastern europe for 40 years . 
  russia does everything it can to deserve the spite it faces . 
   all the upvoted comments in the thread consist of people refusing to mourn russians should n't have started ww2 and enslaved half of the continent if you want empathy . 
  you know how you get that ? 
  look what the netherlands do every year for canadians . 
  they truly _ earned _ it . 
  found the russian nationalist . 
   the soviets defeated 82 % of nazis though . 
  `` let me just pull a bullshit number out of my ass '' . 
  also , does russia celebrate the `` divide poland with nazi germany '' - day , too ? 
  certainly not when they divided poland with nazi germany in 1939, 
  `` soviet union '' was victorious ? 
  no , the allies defeated nazi germany , the soviet union started ww2 together with them . 
  because it 's the eu 's fault . 
  that 's what your comment is . 
  i bet you do n't even know anything about the post-brexit payments . 
  https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/brexit-explained/eu-divorce-bill here , educate yourself . 
  it 's even a heavily biased british site . 
  the uk agreed to the eu budget until 2020 , so guess what the uk is expected to pay ? 
   so the eu wants the uk to pay a bill for stuff it agreed to pay for . 
  til italy has an aircraft carrier . 
   `` but but but i did n't say ` eu ' !!! '', 
  you do n't even understand this , right ? 
  not to mention that you specifically called for `` cutting them off from swift '' which is an eu sanction . 
  why did n't the uk install these other sanctions you are talking about ? 
  clearly it 's not eu sanctions because you deny ever talking about the eu , so it 's just a national issue . 
  looks like the uk does n't want those sanctions then . 
  or you are just full of shit and wanted to do what you always do : blame the eu . 
  and i do n't care what `` my country '' is doing wrong , i am advocating for my position here and against your bullshittery . 
   sanctions sanctions sanctions , cut them off from swift , fuck em hard ! ', 
  and the rest of europe is all ` lets le wait . . ' `` but but but i did n't say ` eu ' !!! '', 
   holy shit way to shove in eu propaganda . 
  your and / u/heknarf 's comment are just blatant excuses to push anti-eu propaganda , so stop acting so whiny when your own arguments are used against you .
