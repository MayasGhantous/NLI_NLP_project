  i remember the uk vetoing georgia 's and ukraine 's nato membership in 2008 , too . 
  without that snobbish british `` we are n't part of your continental politics '' stance , without all those special snowflake deals and rebates and a proper eu defense strategy _ which the uk opposed defiantly _ those brutal russian sanctions would have been an actual possibility . 
  instead one of the biggest eu countries with the biggest army , nukes and a security council veto did n't even manage to convince the other eu countries . 
   good to hear snowden is still good . 
  [ it 's real and still up ] ( https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794450623404113920/photo/1 ), 
  [ wikileaks participated ] ( https://isgp-studies.com/miscellaneous/pizzagate/pizzagate-propaganda/2016-11-04-wikileaks-spirit-cooking-podesta-tweet-kickstarted-pizzagate.jpg ), 
   [ a new angle on mh17 : rebels fired at ukraine fighter jet which was using mh17 as decoy ] ( https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/492033939142619136 ) has wikileaks ever released the massive info on putin and russia ? 
  oh wait , no they send their entire material to belarus and sold it . 
  let 's see how quickly sputnik and rt can make articles out of this . 
  during the presidential campaign in the us they somehow had detailed reports on leaked stuff just an hour after the leak . 
  please tell me that is meant to be sarcastically . 
  i really ca n't tell because this is exactly what some t_d / russian bots would write . 
  we should have gone full on embargo in 2009 already when putin attacked georgia , which he threatened to do during the nato summit in 2008 . 
  we should have gone full embargo when he stole crimea , when he attacked eastern ukraine , when he veto 'd every resolution on syria , when he intervened in syria . 
  seriously even if russian soldiers were to run through the eu we 'd still have our usual people saying that we must talk with russia , take its concerns seriously and that we should stop being so aggressive . 
  i 'm so sick of us not standing up to that shithead . 
  how things do n't work - the comment . 
  you mean if you go back into the recession that lasted from 2008 to 2013 ? 
   still waiting for it to become true as our unemployment falls and economy grows . 
  sure , no problem , let 's play a game called `` spot the brexit '' : can you find out when the [ exchange rate pound/euro suddenly dropped ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0ety9sa.png ) and , [ to this day ] ( http://www.xe.com/de/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=1y ) , never recovered to its former average value ? 
  it 's probably a hint that they seriously consider holding brexit negotiations in french . 
  nice . 
  how to start a revolution : 1 . 
  look badass 2 . 
  kick some butt 3 ??? 
   if the police have enough evidence to consider him an imminent dange they do n't . 
   i really do n't understand why would n't you deport him because you ca n't . 
  deport . 
  german . 
  citizens . 
   remember those right-wing neocon loonies warning us about immigration they did n't warn , they were rambling incoherent , racist bullshit without offering solutions . 
  the people warning , the people saying that there will be problems , the people who proposed actual solutions where those who said , for years , that we must do more for integration , while right-wing neocon loonies went insane over this . 
  does n't change the fact that you ca n't deport them . 
  just like you ca n't deport a spaniard because you assume he _ could _ commit a terrorist attack for eta . 
  this . 
  instead the top comment wants to assassinate those people-smugglers . 
  as if that would help , if there is a demand for smuggling people , there will emerge those who satisfy said demand . 
  seriously this thread looks like / r/european instead of / r/europe . 
  there were serious rumours about prince philip having died during the night as [ queen elizabeth 's entire staff was called to a ` highly unusual ' emergency meeting at buckingham palace ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/694wvt/queen_elizabeths_entire_staff_called_to_highly/ ) . 
  at first , people thought the queen herself may have died because of the very vague headlines and it took several hours until it was confirmed that no royal person died . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  they are only seperated by 10 % , since what one gains , the other loses . 
  that 's way too little . 
   yeah , i have to admit i 've grown somewhat bitter and resentful of the `` free movement of people '' , because 1/3 of our working population has left the country and those of us that stayed are going to be stuck with a very grim bill . 
  got a source for that ? 
  because this is of a magnitude where countries actually collapse and it seems highly exaggerated . 
  and the changes of demographics in bulgaria do n't seem to be correlated with the eu , but the fall of soviet union : [ births & deaths ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/vital_statistics_bulgaria.tif/lossless-page1-1192px-vital_statistics_bulgaria.tif.png ) , [ demographics ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/bulgaria-demography.png ) . 
  not out of date as the icm sunday poll is just as recent as the yougov poll and orb survey , which both show a 13 point lead , in disagreement with the icm poll which places it at 19 points . 
  the yougov poll is backed by another orb survey , while only the icm poll shows a 19 % lead : https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/politics/opinion-polls/news/85504/tory-lead-cut-new-polling-theresa-may-still-course, 
  `` at '' or `` klammeraffe '' ( _ clinching monkey _ ), 
  ah , thanks for providing the context !, 
  yeah , the campaigning problems might actually explain a lot of this !, 
  it appears to me that this is a shock reaction to the polls showing the very strong tory result . 
  i doubt that many people want to see a completely unopposed government ruling the country . 
  or have there been any big , sudden brexit revelations lately ? 
  he should get an eyepatch and then start a violent uprise against putin . 
  that 's why he 's spending a shitload of money on lepen , farage , orban and co to destroy the eu . 
  ca n't say that i have a problem with another great coalition . 
  i can live with mekrel being chancellor , or with schulz being chancellor - both are good , competent candidates . 
  the next big thing will be the baltics , but that will take another 5 years of wearing nato down . 
  `` it 's all planned and they are n't really like this '' yeah , no . 
  he was deputy secretary-general , he was minister of economy , industry and digital affairs , he was an inspector of finances in the french ministry of economy , he founded en marche ! . 
  there have been quite some offices , departments , negotiations or even parties that he led . 
  should n't you know that if you want to post negative comments about him ? 
   i would rather want beer than / u/inglorious _ creek `` so now every redditor that doesnt agree with you is / u/inglorious _ creek '' i guess you still do n't understand that i did n't even generalize . 
  at least i know enough about both people to know that they are competent leaders who can and actually want to compromise . 
  why should i generalize when i want to specifically talk about extremists breaking up the eu ? 
  well maybe , because _ you _ are an extremist longing to break up the eu and get pissed if you get reminded what you are . 
   there was a nato-like alliance as far back as ancient greece which was led by the athenians against the spartans . 
  you did n't even mention the proper name , or cite a source , or how long it lasted , how many countries it spanned , how many languages and cultures it included , how many soldiers it contained . 
  the only thing you said was `` oh there once was some alliance and you are wrong '' . 
  you did n't provide any comparable examples , so there is nothing i could take . 
  you just made a low effort shitpost . 
  so there are n't any comparable examples . 
  so now mentioning the mere existence of extremists that want to break up the eu leads to / u/inglorious _ creek deducting all kinds of statements from your post . 
  logic ? 
  you already failed at reading and interpreting . 
  you are one of the last people who should criticize others for labelling someone they do n't agree with . 
  you forgot georgia . 
  putin attacked and invaded parts of georgia and ukraine after threatening to do so if they were accepted into nato during the 2008 bucharest summit . 
  we were trying to normalise relations , and now those two countries were partially dismantled by russia . 
   the same thing has existed for centuries examples ? 
  lol , as long as russia extends its border every few years we need it . 
  the problems it prevented simply by existing are insane . 
  so a multinational military union existing and growing for 68 years is not an acheivement for you ? 
  because ... nato is a post-war achievement ? 
  you know , like founded in 1949 and stuff ... ? 
  i 'd rather have diplomatic differences than extremists that want to break up the eu , nato and basically every other post war achievement . 
  it 's not bad when the leaders of the two biggest nations in the eu must negotiate and work to find a consensus . 
  he 's projecting what russia does onto the eu and germany . 
  if you want to defeat extremists , prepare when you have an economic crisis . 
  always 5 to 7 years after an economic crisis , ( right wing - ) extremists surge . 
  the greedy thinking of some people in capitalistic countries quickly becomes fear when there is an imagined shortage , which directly translates to xenophobia and extremism . 
  it 's not a coincidence that there was a economic crisis in 1929 and the nazis winning in 1933 , just like it 's no coincidence that there was an economic crisis in 2009 and afd peaking in 2015 . 
  damn , apparently he was climbing alone between camp i and ii , slipped and fell almost a thousand meters down a wall . 
  it 's like the kremlin wrote orbans strategy paper . 
  there were lies , but basically everybody know they where . 
  it 's the people choosing to believe said lies who are the problem . 
  oh myyy , someone stole a handkerchief in a refugee shelter . 
  that 's terrorism !!,
