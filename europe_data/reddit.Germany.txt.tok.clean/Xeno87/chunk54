  this should be the correct one : https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/europe/marine-le-pen-national-front-party.html,

  ... you should read the article . 
  what , are you saying hanging out with nazis is normal for you ? 
  well i guess i know who you are voting for ... 
  [ do you frequently meet with them , dine and drink with them , getting advice or pay them ?

  that 's your fetish , am i right ? 
  usually , yes ? 
  you then certainly ca n't be surprised if you get called one . 
  [ how dare i call someone who hangs out with nazis a nazi ] ( https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/europe/marine-le-pen-national-front-party.html?_r=0&amp;referer=http://m.newser.com/story/241303/le-pen-national-front-closer-than-ever-to-ruling-france.html ), 
  well , one of my frequently written arguments here : [ when you hang out with nazis , you 're probably a nazi ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/marine-le-pen-sure-follows-a-lot-of-white-supremacists ), 
   i dunno , i 'm not studying social studies . 
  i 'm studying physics , i 'm leaving the social stuff to professionals in that matter . 
  they seem to come to the same conclusions as macron , interestingly . 
  high hurdles for immigrants to get out of poverty ? 
  or racist justice system ? 
  i dunno , i 'm not studying social studies . 
  [ when you hang out with nazis , you 're probably a nazi ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/marine-le-pen-sure-follows-a-lot-of-white-supremacists ), 
  the term `` nazi '' was thrown around much more frequently after ww2 , and europe had the best of times back then . 
  maybe we should get a bit conservative and return to this proven behaviour . 
  if you associate with communists but never speak out against them , then you definitely are a communist . 
  and if you associate with communists and frequently speak out against communism , then i must ask why not-communist people do n't want to hang out with you ... 
  well maybe he 's so qualified that he indeed came to the same conclusion as literally everyone else except the nazis : there is no big problem . 
  that 's good !, 
  that means you can focus on actual stuff !, 
  if i was qualified to answer this , i would run in the french elections . 
  but it 's definitely not `` do what the nazis called for '' , that never works . 
  might ask macron about his solution , i 'm sure he 's qualified . 
  when you hang out with nazis , you 're ** probably ** a nazi . 
  if you 're a decent person and somehow forced to hang out with them ( can happen to anyone , really ) , i expect you to show your anti-nazi stance pretty vocally . 
  for example by attending anti nazis rallies or openly calling out and condemning nazis . 
  which is not really what lepen is known for . 
  are negative iq points even possible ? 
  totally nothing else !, 
  that 's what the nsdap wanted , too !, 
  only the bad jews , the good jews can stay !, 
  ... did n't look like this 9 years later . 
  `` forcefully deporting religious minorities is totally not nazi politics '' . 
  / r/totallynotnazis, 
  when people hang out with nazis they 're probably nazis .

  shit , it 's almost as if nazis would have voted for other parties if they promoted nazi politics . 
  i can almost see a pattern , but it 's very diffuse ... 
  yeah , you could only get more russian-bot if you 're start writing stuff like `` crimea is russia , nazi fascist junta !! '',

  [ heeeey macronena ] ( https://youtu.be/anzznp8hlvq ), 
  70 years after ww2 , a nazi gets 21 % in a country formerly occupied by nazi germany . 
  i wan na puke , but that would n't be nice to macron who did a remarkable job . 
  do n't you jinx it . 
  labour should drop corbyn if they even want to have a shot . 
  the eurosceptics are the usual crowd that are only impressed by power , might and bling bling . 
  for those , the eu should have aggressively promote itself , calling it the greatest , best institution ever , with parades , and glory and shit . 
  so you want to let erdogan tv run without competition ? 
  yeah , that will definitely work . 
  well or how about we dedicate an actual turkish tv channel for turkish people in europe , so they see _ our _ view and not erdogan tv ? 
  professionals know how many refugees are where and in what conditions and what laws apply to them . 
  i bet you do n't even know how many refugees are in your country . 
  lol , i let professionals handle this , not stupid twelve year olds commenting on reddit . 
  lol , i let professionals handle this , not stupid twelve year olds commenting on reddit . 
  the solution is not being a scared sissy , increasing border personnel and letting the professionals do their job . 
  open borders means that people can actually flee from those islamist shitheads into better countries , flee from their influence and reach . 
  terrorist idiots have the financial means and organization to even cross closed borders by forging id 's , bribing border guards or smuggling . 
  i 'm absolutely convinced we will see a terrorist attack in germany in the heat of elections . 
  does n't need to happen right away . 
  it 's enough if it happens in a year , or two , or five . 
  why ? 
  because : * nationalists are dumb fucks who can not govern and run countries into the ground _ every single time _ . 
  * nationalists promote hate and fear * nationalists overreact and produce more war , more tension , more xenophobia , so islamists can point their finger at us and say `` see , they hate us , that 's why you must fight them '' . 
  nationalists are islamists best recruiters . 
  right as lepen fell to the lowest level . 
  your enemies want you to elect nationalists . 
  while we just sit there and watch how their puppet parties get elected . 
  i 'm still completely convinced that russia help nk to advance their nuclear program . 
  i do n't think it 's a coincidence that nk managed to test an h-bomb a few months after putin visited pyongyang . 
  as a reddit commenter ? 
  not forgetting that putin kills journalists , constantly bringing up this topic , always criticizing russia for doing stuff like this . 
  the worst thing you can do is accept this as if it is normal - it is not . 
  in russia it may be frequent , but it is not normal . 
   many of his `` attacks on the first amendment '' are things the first amendment does n't protect , like suing someone for slander . 
  the things he is advocating for are protected by the first amendment , which is the entire point of the articles . 
  the supreme court has repeadetly endorse the current legel standard regarding libel laws and protecting journalists from that . 
  quote : `` to win such a case , the plaintiff must demonstrate that factually incorrect statements were made with actual malice or a reckless disregard for the truth . 
  trump said he would like to lower that standard . 
  ` we 're going to have people sue you like you never got sued before , '' he said . ', 
  '' those are actual attacks on the first amendment , and changing the current legal standard to weaken it would require a constitutional amendment . 
   you ca n't say trump is unprecedentedly attacking the media , when obama basically kicked out the major conservative outlets from many events , called them liars , and etc. 
  it seems you are mixing up the obama and trump administration . 
  obama _ never _ banned conservative media from the white house press corps , he never sought to , and he never called them liars . 
  there were rumours , [ orginating from fox ] ( http://www.mediaite.com/tv/tipping-point-white-house-press-pool-stands-up-for-fox-news/ ) that the obama administration would plot to exclude fox from participating in a round of interviews with executive pay czar , kenneth feinberg . 
  this however never happened . 
  this is nothing compared to the fact that trump , completely unprecedented , banned cnn , politico , the la times , buzzfeed and the new york times from the white house press gaggle . 
  also unprecedented are trumps insulting speeches towards journalists and _ actually _ calling them liars . 
  obama has never called journalists `` liars '' , even those who claimed he was a kenyan muslim . 
  which is a rumour made up by trump . 
   you can say what you want about mike pence and sessions , but they both have made it clear they will uphold obama era eo 's that protect lbg community trump signed into law on monday a bill overturning a barack obama executive order that required companies seeking contracts with the federal government to show compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws .
