  this is one of the obama era protections , not exclusively , but mainly focussing on barring discrimination against federal workers specifically on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . 
  last week , the department of health and human services ( hhs ) eliminated questions that were designed to compile information about lgbt seniors . 
  earlier this month , the department of housing and urban development declared it would withdraw two agency notices geared toward protecting lgbt people experiencing homelessness . 
  and on 13 march , the state department included in its official us delegation to the united nations ' 61st annual commission on the status of women conference two anti-lgbt human rights activists . 
  on top of that , trump has not condemned the current anti-gay purges in chechnya . 
  the actions of this government and of trump speak more than everything they say - those are anti-lgbt actions , not pro . 
   yes , there is the no muslim thing too , which is a-ok to me . 
  islam is so sexist and homophobic it 's insane . 
  so is literally every religion , but freedom of religion is a constitutional right by the first amendment . 
  christianity , judaism , hundreds of religions are sexist and homophobic , it does n't matter . 
   that 's us statute donald trump called for a complete shutdown of _ muslims _ . 
  not muslim immigrants ( which would also be unconstitutional ) , muslims as a whole , including muslim americans . 
   ehhh , anti-fa seems to mirror what they were pretty well except they are a bunch of wimps . 
  silencing dissenting opinions through violence . 
  the sa , the reichsbanner schwarz-rot-gold and the rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund were party controlled organizations . 
  what you are calling antifa are unorganized , not party controlled civiliians . 
  if you consider some antifa people to be comparable to the sa , then the kkk which actively endorses trump , as well as his red-hat wearing supporters would be , too . 
   you do n't understand how the medicare/medicaid system works then . 
  right now there are very very strict price controls actually . 
  what he is arguing is simply using the goverements buying power to negotiate prices on those drugs for people in these programs that have very strict price controls for doctors already . 
  it seems more like the government is engaging in the free market than setting price controls ? 
  your argument was that he does n't support price control , however , he does . 
   the problem is there are way too many folks using psuedo intellectual arguments about fiscal and social policies , but then arguing like they have the intellectual high ground . 
  these tend to be gender-studides , philosiphy , and other bs degree majors . 
  i do agree he may seem anti-academic at times because acedmia does n't prepare you for the real world or a job where you contribute to the nation in a real tangible way in many cases . 
  this is actually anti-intellectualism . 
  without actually knowing the subject , having studied and worked on it for years , concluding that experts who actually did this are unqualified . 
   anti-science i do n't think so . 
  pretty sure he loves military science and nasa science . 
  just does n't want nasa spending 1/3 of their budget on studying earth . 
  he completely cut the earth science from nasa , he cut the eduaction office , he put gag-orders on scientists and his administration deleted several databses of valuable scientific data . 
   modernism rejects realism and religion . 
  that 's insane . 
  modernism is such a misnomer because some of the most mordern innovative best places to live do n't seem like modernist places . 
  that 's not what modernism does . 
  individual modernists did , but that 's not defining for the philosophical movement . 
   considering the media calls him all sorts of name and for his impeachment everyday , and nothing has happened to them , i do n't see this happening . 
  he called journalists traitors and liars often enough . 
  obama never did , no other us president has so far . 
  this is exactly what the statement `` disagreement is treason '' implies . 
   he loves the indian community , and indian immigrants . 
  and absolutely detestes muslims . 
  this is the crucial point . 
   / r/doitfortheplot , but fr what ? 
  crooked hillary , obama wiretapping him , liberals trying to kill the country  i 've never seen this from him . 
  he calls people `` weak '' or `` losers '' on a daily basis . 
  he insulted disabled people . 
  this is pure and utter contempt . 
   that 's politics . 
  [ no , not in that extent like trump does ] ( https://datavizblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/who-lies-more-a-comparison.jpg ) . 
  he even lies about his inauguration crowd size - that is n't poltiics . 
  * edit * : also , the trump administration hits every single point on my ( or well , umberto 's ) list of defining chracteristics . 
  normal governments do n't even hit one . 
  a sensible government should n't care about modernism because it 's way too absorbed about economics for example . 
  a sensible government should listen to scientists , not make them erase data . 
  it worked with the soviet union , too . 
  and maybe increase fighting putin ? 
  oh wow , you are actually the first one to actually answer me to this instead of saying `` no you claimed he was a fascist , you have to provide proof '' . 
  for this , i upvoted you , even though i deeply object with your position . 
  i will first write my objections about your statements , and then provide characteristics i believe to be defining for fascism that apply to trump . 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  trump does n't wish to silence dissenting opinions . 
  he is one of the most judicious users of freedom of speech , and one of the biggest defenders . 
  * [ trump wants to weaken first amendment protections for journalists ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trump-threatens-to-weaken-first-amendment-protections-for-reporters/ ) * [ he has a long history of bullying people who oppose him with lawsuits ] ( http://www.medialaw.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3470 ) * [ he wants to jail or strip people of their citizenship for burning the flag which is a form of free speech as judged by the supreme court ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/why-trump-flag-burning-tweet-disturbing-527208 ) * his attacks on journalists are unprecedented by any american presidential candidate or president * [ his plans directly are in violation of the first amendment ] ( http://reason.com/blog/2015/11/20/donald-trump-has-now-trashed-the-1st-ame )  he does n't want to seize all the assets of global capitalist or jews . 
  this did n't start in nazi germany until 1939 , after 6 years of nazi rule . 
  obviously they were fascist long before that . 
  and was n't one of his proposals to make mexico pay for the wall to seize mexican asstes in the us and freeze money transfer until mexico complies ? 
   he does n't want to persecute any group that fascist do ( global capitalist , jews , gypsies , homosexuals , disabled ) . 
  * he chose mike pence as his vice president and jeff sessions as ag . 
  pence is widely known for his discrimination against the lgbt community , jeff sessions voted against basically anything that would have been positive for the lgbt community . 
  then has also chose rick perry , tom price , ryan zinke , mick mulvaney and many more who directly acted against the lgbt community . 
  * the nazi party did n't focus on gays until 1933 , after ernst r\u00f6hm ( a gay high ranking sa officer ) was killed . 
  obviously , the nazis were fascist before that . 
  * he wants to persecute and discriminate against muslims . 
  this one group you just flat out ignored . 
   he wants to deport criminal illegal aliens , that 's all that 's not all . 
  there 's this `` complete and total shutdown for muslims '' - thing , this is a bit more than `` just '' deporting illegal aliens . 
  he wants to dscriminate against an entire religion . 
  this is a pretty serious matter . 
   does n't want to take anyone 's guns like hitler . 
  this actually did n't even happen , it is [ counterfactual history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_gun_control_theory ) . 
  the nazi party actually loosened weapons rights compared to the laws of weimar republic . 
   he does n't want to unionize everyone in the nation . 
  [ he lashes out hard against workers unions and chose anti-union picks . ] ( http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-unions-war-232382 ) . 
  something about unionizing by the nsdap : the nsdap did attack and destroy unions in germany . 
  the daf ( german labour front ) was n't a labour union in any sense , but a tool meant to boost german capabilities for war and also bind the german workforce to the new government . 
   does n't have brownshirts . 
  those armed troops were common for parties back then , for example , the [ rotfrongk\u00e4mpferbund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roter_frontk%c3%a4mpferbund ) of the german communist party or the [ reichsbanner schwarz-rot-gold ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsbanner_schwarz-rot-gold ) by social democratic/centrist parties . 
  those troops are a relic of parties back then , something you do n't find in mainstream politics anymore today . 
   does n't want to institute price controls on the market . 
  [ he does ] ( http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/presidential-campaign/267831-trump-backs-price-controls-free-enterprise-in-peril ) many things you listed were unique to fascism in germany . 
  however , there also was fascism in spain or italy which did n't have those same things . 
  i think what you call fascism differs heavily from what i call fascism . 
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the characteristics that define fascism the most , in my opinion , are pretty close to those of umberto eco . 
  * anti-intellectualism , anti-scientific beliefs * anti modernism * a cult of strong and decisive actions * disagreement is treason * fear of difference ( i.e. 
  cultures , societies , races , immgirants ) * appeal to a frustrated middle class * obsession with a plot * enemy of pacifism , militarism * contempt for the weak or poor * the frequent and obsessive use of the political lie all of those listed above are things that can be found in the fascist movements of the 30 's , in all countries , as well as in trump 's movement , rhetoric and actions . 
  [ i 'm trusting people who have lived through adolf hitler 's reign in their judgement . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/27/politics/anne-frank-donald-trump-adolf-hitler/ ) if you do n't think trump , putin or lepen are n't fascist , you might wan na tell us where they or their parties differ from the nazi party or smiliar fascist movements . 
  the movie [ v for vendetta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsa7maholaw ) , an awesome movie about a dystopian british future . 
   this is the issue on both sides . 
  not when the subject is a polandball comment .
