  he politely asked a question if they could have increased their chances of survival based on a physical process . 
  you insulted him for asking this question , to which he rebuts with a source showing that he was right in the first place . 
  now you 're saying that finnish saunas obey different laws of physics than czech sauna . 
  maybe it 's you who should go back to school . 
  not only for education , but for manners . 
  [ you 're comparing a rigged election to a rigged election . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_fraud_and_violence_during_the_turkish_general_election,_june_2015 ) of course those numbers do n't surprise you at all , they are meant to . 
  rigging with implausible numbers is not as helpful as you would think . 
  you guys realize that this election was rigged , right ? 
  so what are the chances that the postal votes were rigged , too ? 
  those numbers have no significance . 
   even though i literally hate the guy i would n't want him to be assassinated newer the less he is a father of 4 and a human being . 
  and what if the death of just one person saves thousands of lives ? 
  those people dying because of erdogan , do n't they have family , too ? 
  that 's what georg elser thought about . 
  * edit * : also you respect the other side ? 
  too bad that is n't mutual , that 's why `` no '' is losing . 
  [ at this point i do n't see another way .

  everyone knows this , but nobody does anything against it . 
  that 's how democracy dies - no because of a ballot , but because nobody does anything . 
  yup , exactly . 
  but damn , this requires actual knowledge beyond hitler documentaries from history channel !, 
  but but but you ca n't call her nazi because she did n't gas anyone !!, 
  ! 111eleven t. every nazi ever, 
  it 's funny that donny moscow made his country drop right to the same level as russia . 
   oh come on , after all that has happened in recent years , it was a reasonable assumption to make . 
  no , exactly because of everything that has happened in recent years . 
  when that kid in munich went on a rampage , everyone knew it had to be islamist terror - it was n't . 
  when short after berlin another vehicle plowed into pedestrians , everyone knew it had to be islamist terror - it was n't . 
  there are hundreds of attacks , incidents and accidents in europe all the time that are n't reported on , which everyone here woudl immediatly classify as islamist terror . 
  but everytime it was n't islamist terror , those same idiots who jumped to conclusions ignore that they were wrong . 
  on top of the entire `` shut the fuck up until you know for certain '' : this whole attack was completely different from anything before , something the police pretty quickly realized . 
  it was aimed at a football club instead at football fans . 
  the letter was worded very strangely and referred to ramstein , which non islamistic terrorist organization has ever done . 
  it mimicked exactly the demands of right wing idiots . 
  but damn did / r/europe know everything better . 
  the comments here were completely convinced that a quran in the flesh planted the bombs and that we need to get every muslim out of europe . 
  good , i can agree that this indeed is inciting violence or at the very least is in most cases demeaning . 
  now we only need a direct link between eu funding to the pa and this propaganda material . 
  because if the eu is providing money to the pa , but this money is solely used to build hospitals for example , drying up this money flow would yield a worse outcome while not shutting down this propaganda . 
  the eu commission reguarly evaluates the aid to the palestinian authority in great detail . 
  [ the evaluation results are open to the public . 
  ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/18500/node/18500_sv ) i really ca n't find positions or investments that were misused to fund terrorist activities . 
  funding hospitals and the likes seems like a good investment to me . 
   citation needed, 
  yes . 
  if nobody can fund islamist propaganda or hate preachers , how are people supposed to radicalize them ? 
  that 's not the only thing . 
  creating propaganda ? 
  that costs money . 
  ca n't live from preaching alone , need money to do it . 
  people said that about germans , but here we are . 
  it 's pretty common to show or reference the movie during protests against this dancing ban . 
  anti-russia . 
  of course , strongly opposing a country and its current society ~ ~ ca n't ~ ~ should n't be translated on individual people . 
  there are always good people in shitty countries . 
  obviously , nobody would think erdogan is left . 
  a russian in exile not being fond of the putin regime . 
  damn now i 've seen it all . 
  oh yeah , it does . 
  but i want to remind everyone that shitty countries are not unfixable . 
  i 'm one of the most anti russia ~ ~ n ~ ~ / anti putin people , but i feel the need to point out that people thought the very same about germany once , too . 
  it requires great effort , but russia has the potential to be an acutal , civilised , non-hostile country like all others . 
  this is n't just an `` anti-gay purge '' . 
  being anti-gay is the pretext , the purge 's purpose is to target dissidents and opposition . 
  they are accused of homosexuality so they can be locked away and beat to shit . 
  kicking some `` subhuman gays '' is just the justificiation . 
   just because she keeps enough welfare to support her populist proposals ( that exclude non-nationals resident ) does n't make her far-left . 
  historic example : [ national socialist people 's welfare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_people%27s_welfare ) . 
  the schulz-effect is enormous . 
  i 'm discussing this basically everytime : for months , when afd soared in the polls , parties reacted to this and took a turn to the right , claiming that you would need to take the `` concerns of the people '' seriously and bla bla bla . 
  immediatly as schulz was nominated , afd plunged right into the shitter , from steadily more than 13 percent to less then 10 and falling . 
  this is proof that the parties , csu before anything else , should have made a shift to the left instead . 
  #introduction [ geert wilders was convicted of discriminzation ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/09/geert-wilders-found-guilty-in-hate-speech-trial-but-no-sentence-imposed ) and there have been several commenters on this sub who think that his remarks were n't in any way racist . 
  i heavily disagree , and this post is meant to not only show why wilders ' statements are fundamentally racist and divisive , but also why they can never be tolerated in a meaningful political discussion . 
  #why it was indeed racist one of the remarks for which wilders was convicted was in the following situation :  after his party had narrowly failed to become the largest group on the hague 's city council , wilders asked a roomful of supporters if they wanted to have `` more or fewer moroccans '' in the country . 
  when the crowd shouted back `` fewer ! '' , he replied : `` well , we 'll take care of that . '' let 's break that down : wilders promises to take care that there will be fewer moroccans in the netherlands in the future . 
  note that wilders does not talk about refugees at all , he does not refer to criminals or illegal immigrants , he simply states `` morroccans '' . 
  he talks about every person who wants to live in the netherlands and who is of moroccan descent . 
  this includes all ordinary people who legally want to move to another country for a job or exchange students . 
  this applies for example to the phd student who got a position at the university of amsterdam or every other person who ever applied for dutch citizenship and was awarded it . 
  this is completely , utterly different to calling for a faster deportation of people who entered the country illegally ( and were caught ) or people that live in the netherlands without dutch citizenship and became a criminal offender ( convicted in court ) . 
  it is also completely different to calling for less amount of granted asylum applications . 
  ** wilders wants people of a certain descent out of the country , no matter the qualification , legal status or criminal offense record ** . 
  in a functioning society , there are only a few people who are allowed to decide wether or not a person must leave the country or not . 
  usually , those people are judges or other officials . 
  a judge may order the deportation of a criminal non-citizen or illegal alien . 
  an immigration official may decide upon the matter if a candidate applying for asylum or citizenship meets the legal criteria to live in the netherlands . 
  the right to decide about the legality of a person lies not with any politician at all . 
  politicians may decide on the criteria that have to be met for a person to gain citizenship or be granted asylum , but they are neither allowed nor can they decide the actual , indivdual case . 
  those criteria may be education , qualification , marriage status , wealth , talent or fear for one 's life . 
  ** but since wilders does not state any other criteria besides heritage , his remarks simply are racist ** . 
  #why this ca n't be tolerated the reason for any political discussion should be the intent to find a productive way to change things for the better . 
  political discussions never lack any heat , everybody knows this . 
  people basically never agree when it comes to political views . 
  we are n't born with them , we decide upon them , we create our own opinion . 
  if someone disagrees with my political opinion , this is something that can be changed - if either i or the other person is being convinced by arguments . 
  this forms the basis for political discussion .
