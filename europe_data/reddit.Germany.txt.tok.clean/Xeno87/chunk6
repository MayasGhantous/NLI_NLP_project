  you know , i would be totally ok with cancelling it if it would 've gotten out of negotiation phase and then by reading through it it becomes apparent that it would make things worse . 
  but this is not what happened . 
  instead , we had people who do n't know how negotiations work , how passing laws work , who never even read the thing _ because it is n't even finished _ , spur bullshit all over the place , ignoring [ the insane amount of information the eu ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230 ) threw at its citizens to inform them . 
  we had populist dickheads being populists , and now they won . 
  and i 'm not ok with that . 
  [ i bet you are one of the small number of people who do n't trust the snhr ] ( http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/2704_civilians_killed_by_russian_forces_en.pdf ) . 
   seeing how every time european countries attacked russia in the past [ yeah , i remember this time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) . 
   before russian started to intervene in syria well , you do realize that before russia actively intervened in syria , it blocked _ every single _ international effort to stop the syrian war and also supported the shit out of that insane dictator assad ? 
  you know , when there is no money for your own military anymore , then you ca n't support those of your dictator friends , either . 
   and most ukrainian refugees go russia half of the ukrainian refugees ( displaced people ) stayed in ukraine , while a million went to belarus and russia , the rest to poland or other neighobring countries . 
  btw , you realize that once there is no russian fueled war anymore , those people can go _ back _ , losing their efugee status ? 
  yeah , you see , the difference is that france did that _ after _ a war , while my goal is to do it _ before _ there is a war . 
   so nobody can tell me that spiegel online is doing a live ticker the whole night , but it takes them more than 2 days to report the biggest mass groping and raping in the recent german history ? 
  you know , unlike your `` english speaking newspaper '' , spiegel online and all big german newspapers with reputation report on either officially verified stuff or very plausible things . 
  knowing that there was no police statement , no press agency statement that evening [ and twitter was awfully quiet that day ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=cologne%20since%3a2016-01-01%20until%3a2016-01-02&amp;src=typd ) , there was actually no legitimate reason for spiegel online to report . 
  and seeing that there was [ an official terror warning in munich ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/muenchen-terrorwarnung-an-silvester-der-ueberblick-a-1070170.html ) at the same time and _ no verified information whatsoever _ about cologne , it 's totally understandable that there were no reports . 
  and actually , i want to know what `` english speaking newspaper '' that was when it sources local news , which at that time , the cologne happenings still were . 
  because if your story is true at all , then i 'm sure it 's one that reports every bullshit without fact checking . 
  which again , is shitty journalism . 
  not that you would understand that , either . 
  afd voters tend to not get journalistic integrity . 
   after new years eve in cologne it took the big media a couple days to report that this is n't correct , i had a [ comment on that ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/46va2h/germany_migrant_shelter_fire_cheered_by_onlookers/d08c46g ) in january , for example [ focus online ] ( http://www.focus.de/regional/koeln/in-der-silvesternacht-frauen-am-koelner-hauptbahnhof-sexuell-belaestigt_id_5184802.html ) reported on it on january the first already . 
  `` big media '' started reporting on this very quickly , and only the details took a while since they all wanted to wait for the official police press conference , which was scheduled a few days later . 
  the rumor that german media was forced to be silent about cologne was actively perpetuated in social media to spread mistrust against our journalists . 
  but it wo n't be forgotten that europe 's refugee crisis started with russia blocking every international intervention or un program to stop the syrian civil war . 
  seeing the current topic , i.e. 
  that russia is destroying our societies by funding extremists and spreading misinformation to destabilize us , i 'd say `` tough shit russia , better do n't pick a fight with people that can fuck you up '' . 
  if you did n't notice , i am proposing this to making russia stop what it is doing . 
  i did not say we should continue it once our goals are reached . 
  you know , when you do n't watch rt all day you actually know real stuff . 
  [ for example ukraines almost independency of russia ] ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-01-12/how-ukraine-weaned-itself-off-russian-gas ) . 
  you apparently are n't up to date anymore - russia is completely negligible in economic terms . 
  [ and seeing that we import basically no food from `` the biggest wheat exporter '' , i 'm confident that nobody will suffer ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/73367000/gif/_73367223_eu_russia_trade_464gr.gif ) . 
  wow , i 'm sure the worlds biggest economy will suffer heavy losses when it stops trading with a country whose gdp is smaller than that of spain . 
  yeah , putin ca n't make money appear . 
  his russia can economically collapse just like the ussr . 
  `` slashing every other government program '' would result in a collapse of russia in less than two years . 
  [ like the snhr report ? 
  ] ( http://sn4hr.org/wp-content/pdf/english/2704_civilians_killed_by_russian_forces_en.pdf ), 
  no more monies to pay soldiers -  no more ( russian ) war in eastern ukraine or syria . 
  just to make it a bit clearer , [ russia in one year killed more people than isis in 3 years ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-has-killed-more-civilians-than-isis-kg7wfsw8w ) . 
  russia is actively producing refugees with that `` strategy '' . 
  both . 
  if a trade embargo triggers ww3 ( and therefore the destruction of mankind ) , my god then we should 've never let this country even be . 
  `` the mean kids react to the shit i 'm doing '' . 
  so you propose we just let putin slowly take over our countries , because else mighty russia could do something ? 
  * edit * : also , destroying its economy means less money for warfare and better outcome for the rest of the world in this case . 
  how can russia be any more aggressive without starting ww3 ? 
  i fail to see what else it could do , seeing that it already actively attacked all bordering non-nato , non-eu countries in europe . 
  * edit * : ok , belarus was n't attacked yet . 
  also , it is worth nothing that there is no `` military/fsb establishment '' . 
  there is the military and there is the fsb , and those two establishments are constantly fighting each other when it comes to terms of power . 
  * edit * : [ here ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/putins_hydra_inside_russias_intelligence_services ) is a good read about the constant fight between russias secret services . 
  cut off russia from swift , go for a full on embargo , and there wo n't be a problem anymore within the next 10 years . 
  no sudden `` rebel '' regions breaking away extending russia border , no more false stories on the internet , and a financial crisis for all extremist parties throughout europe . 
  on top of that , a huge decline in refugees . 
  * edit * : if only half of the people who are outraged by my proposal would move to russian forums and write comments advocating to make russia stop doing this shit , then this problem would be solved much easier and quicker . 
  however , wanting to live in peace with your neighboring countries and having actual democracy does n't appear to be the `` cool '' thing today . 
   because putin wants to assassinate them . 
  sure . 
  [ seeing what happened to the former anti doping chief and federal director , yes , he apparently wants . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/15/former-russian-anti-doping-chief-nikita-kamayev-dies-report ), 
  exactly . 
  i thought we already had this discussion when the bikini was invented . 
  but no , apparently people always find some obscure shit they can cry about . 
  [ independence day parade 2014 ] ( http://www.vosizneias.com/assets/uploads/news_photos/thumbnails/800_7ksz7sosir99ppqbxfm8naj0gff8ojqd.jpg ) vs [ independence day parade 2016 ] ( http://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2016/08/24/ukraine_independence_day.jpeg-6647e_s878x585.jpg?9739c089d09019457eff90957353d2bf131e7da7 ) . 
  though i 'm not sure if those are comparable or not ( different battaillions etc ), 
   i must say that sending letters to mr. putin is russian widespread illness . 
  it is basic human behaviour . 
  [ happens with all leaders , and authoritorian dickwats are no exception to this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2178229/letters-hitler-written-ordinary-germans-revealed-time.html ) . 
  my issue with merkel is her blatant short-sighted or waiting approach . 
  i 'm not against shutting up and carefully deciding , but when there is a huge debate she always keeps quiet for so long until a definite majority has a certain decision - and this is then most likely the one she will adopt . 
  a journalist once called her `` the poll chancellor '' since she apparently commissioned the most polls in current affairs to then base her stance on public opinion . 
  this tactic is one she adopted from her political father , helmut kohl . 
  and then , there 's something that i think is a good example for her short sightedness , although this usually ends in a long decision about nuclear power . 
  so , there once was a decision made to completely , but slowly abandon nuclear power in germany . 
  the conservative parties were totally opposed to that , and under merkel , the flip flop was about to happen : , in 2011 , we were only one month from abandoning our plans to abandon nuclear power , when fukushima happened . 
  this was the only reason why the original plan , to abandon nuclear power , was pulled through . 
  it literally took merkel , a physicist who should 've known better , a second chernobyl to realize that we had to abandon nuclear power . 
  no discussion , no argument was able to convinced her , only an actual catastrophe was . 
  this is not a trait i want in a politician . 
  but her stance against putin , though much , much weaker than i wished it was , and especially her stance on refugees were actually two big policies where i , wholeheartedly was able to say `` i can follow and trust her in this decision '' . 
  i 'm still convinced she had traits that are just unfitting for a good politician , but i also recognize that she is not a bad politician , either . 
   you ca n't prohibit teaching without university degree . 
  it is against freedom of religion , freedom of teaching and freedom of speech . 
  my attempt of a translation : to become a parson , applicants have to study theology and pass the respective church order exams . 
   you ca n't make an islamic state church mandatory and so you 'd have to rely on convincing people , which would be hard because there is no tradition of central organisation of belief in islam . 
  german churches are adminstered as local foundations or associations , too . 
  this is nothing new . 
   attempts to educate our `` own '' imams are underway , but they are hampered for several reasons . 
  some monetary , other idealogical . 
  there was a good piece in the economist about it , if you are interested . 
  i sure am !, 
   islamic education in school for those interested in it is indeed a must , but at the moment we lack qualified personal to do it . 
  a problem that will still take some time to be resolved . 
  totally agree . 
  [ or wear this . 
  ] ( http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/meznlkorow5flcltfg_dbla.jpg ) there are a lot of methods to exploit such a law . 
   because the curriculum for that is made by the churches , not by the government . 
  government is only paying for it .
