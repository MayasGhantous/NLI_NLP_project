  this is just plain wrong . 
  the curriculum ( _ lehrplan _ ) is always passed by the respective ministry of education and cultural affairs . 
  [ for example , take sachsen-anhalt ] ( http://www.bildung.sachsen-anhalt.de/schulen/lehrplaene-rahmenrichtlinien/rahmenrichtlinien/ ) , which explicitly states that the catholic and protestant churches are only consulted . 
  it 's basically the same for other federal states . 
   that would be huge violation of freedom of speech . 
  you do n't need a degree to preach , that 's insane . 
   you mean similar to the christian church tax ? 
  because government does n't decide what that is used for . 
  they 're just collecting it for them . 
  this is correct . 
  however , controlling the money flow is still a _ huge _ power . 
  makes it harder or even impossible for other countries ( saudi arabia ) to influence german muslim community . 
   because the christian churches are hierachical organisations that you can put in charge of handling those things . 
  islam is n't an organisation , you simply do n't have anybody with the authority for those things . 
  [ wrong on the first part . 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirchenfinanzierung ) and what works for christianity , will work for islam . 
   did we ? 
  this is completely new to me . 
  back in the 20 's and 30 's everybody was wearing hats as far as i know . 
  it 's clearly not the same though . 
  kippa does n't cover your face . 
  that 's why i was asking , still unsure about that . 
  i remember reading something about it , but ca n't find a source . 
  [ ever learned to google ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-mask_laws ) obviously not , i guess you are used to getting everything handed to you . 
  explains your position . 
   but that does n't really matter since muslims insist the burqa is n't a religious garment . 
  got a source for that ? 
  because this does n't sound like anything i 've heard the central council of german muslims states [ see this comment for more ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4z3pzj/burkas_may_be_banned_from_public_places_in_germany/d6swtqw ), 
  it sure did . 
  if you want more context : [ here ] ( http://www.anapsid.org/cnd/mcs/maskcodes.html ) is a website about us regional laws covering the face . 
  in austria , only \u00a7 9 of the assembly law prohibits masks covering faces ** during demonstrations ** . 
  which is not what the original comment was about . 
  same in germany , 17a abs . 
  unlike you , i actually know what i 'm talking about . 
  nope , i just proved with a single image that this statement was wrong . 
  yep , i know . 
  which is why i 'm citing sources and , note , am using phrases like `` most likely '' . 
  in the us , this is not true . 
  in general , it is completely legal to cover your face , there are only some states and regions that have special anti-mask laws ( washington dc for example ) . 
  in germany , yes , covering your face during demonstrations is prohibited . 
  but this is not what was originally stated :  you ca n't go out completely covering your face . 
  i can go out , completely.coveri g my face , basically everywhere in the western hemisphere without having problems , except for few , few regions . 
  i 'm still wondering what this is supposed to achieve . 
  i can imagine a complete ban on covering the face in public . 
  aside from banning all halloween or winter masks , what would actually change ? 
  hardcore fundamentalist women then would probably not leave the house anymore and isolate themselves/get isolated by their families . 
  and terrorist attacks would also not be prevented at all since * there has n't been a single terrorist attack conducted by an attacker dressed in a burka in germany * a terrorist ready to die wo n't give a shit about a law that bans covering the face * a backback and tourists outfit is much better for smuggling a bomb into a crowd so , instead of working on the problem , we just opress ( yes , that 's the right word ) religious freedom , isolating and partially stigmatizing muslims even more and giving them more reason to reject our society . 
  in my opinion , it would be way , way smarter to just * add islam education to our schools so the government decides who teaches what to our kids * make a college degree in theology mandatory for imams , so we know that the people preaching are properly educated and who is preaching * impose a religious tax for muslims so that the government decides and knows what money is being used and what for all those three points are already accomplished for christian and jewish religion , but somehow , nobody wants to advocate doing the same for islam . 
  * edit * : also , did n't we discuss exactly _ the same _ shit back in the 20 's and 30 's with the jewish kippa ? 
  how it does not reflect our values and stuff ? 
  [ it most likely does . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/despite-cdu-csu-push-germany-cant-legally-ban-burqas/a-19471427 ) thankfully , lawyers and judges are to decide upon that and not reddit comments . 
   you ca n't go out completely covering your face . 
  [ you sure ? 
  ] ( http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2011/06/a99.jpeg ), 
  [ which can lead to pretty unwanted consequences . 
  ] ( http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2011/06/a99.jpeg ), 
  which would result in kids being educated religous at home or closed societies , where neither the government nor other secular groups can prevent hate speeches and indoctrination . 
  young , stupid kids getting radicalized by backyard imams that have n't had a college education is one of the big problems we face today , but somehow , everyone thinks it 's necessary to ban islam education at our schools where we actually could decide who teaches what to those kids . 
   in my mind schools are generally supposed to be free of religious symbols and influence . 
  having religion at our schools is actually one of the most important things . 
  in germany , we have religious education in schools . 
  for example , at my school you had to choose between catholic or protestant classes or ethics class . 
  this is actually a big deal , as the government decides who teaches what to kids . 
  this way , our religious education is very secular and focussed on comparing and discussing religions . 
  getting rid of that would be a big defeat for secularism . 
  on a side note , this is not a general niqab ban at schools , this was n't decided in this case . 
  the court only decided that it was lawful for the school to not admit the girl with this dress because she did not appear in court . 
  it is not stated in this article , but the judge explicitly mentioned that a discussion about religious freedom at schools could have taken place if she had appeared and that there was a chance of the court deciding in her favor . 
  so , apparently you have n't covered absurdity as a rhetorical device in school yet ? 
   looking at such a high macro level does n't do anything . 
  lol . 
   you 're being intellectually dishonest by trying to address the issue of crime and unemployment among refugees/asylum seekers by rolling off macroeconomic figures which are clearly good in spite of aforementioned unemployment/crime . 
  you know the problem with `` 3 times more likely to be criminal '' ? 
  what if the probability to be criminal is 1 % in the entire population . 
  if you take in people , ok , then for those pople it 's 3 % . 
  which leaves 97 % who contribute to society , ** who would n't be there to contribute if you would n't let them in ** . 
  this is what we call `` net gain '' . 
   you got so rekt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1exuyjqchnq&amp;t=3s  about pragmatic real-life things let me guess - `` real life things '' is everything that fits your narrative ? 
  [ can you explain to me why the dutch crime rate went down directly after taking in refugees ? 
  ] ( http://civitas.org.uk/content/files/eurostatnetherlands.png ) that 's werid . 
   you 're attempting to look at macro statistics which is the entire point of argument - ** medium to long time benefit ** . 
  i know , you suffer from a reading disability . 
   so essentially you do n't give a shit if all this ends up with a crap ton more people on welfare and more crime i do give a crap , that 's why i agree with the authors of that study - take in refugees and let them work easily . 
  which is the message this study transported and you ignored . 
  must be boring in such an echo chamber . . 
  you mean the netherlands do n't have declining unemplyloyment , riaisng wages and gdp and a satisfactory index higher than oecd average ? 
  because it sure does n't look like , kiddo . 
  for example , taking all people that actively interfere with the political process and endanger lives to syria to fight against is ? 
  sounds kinda ok to me ... 
   my only worry is will the refugees be sent back . 
  with yugoslavia , this was the case . 
  with syria , i honestly ca n't say . 
   and arabs/iraqis/iranians / east africans , as my study shows , do significantly worse than yugoslavs . 
  let 's see :  people from former yugoslavia participate the most [ in the labour market ] ( 65 % )  60 % of iranians in the netherlands have work . 
  weird , iranians do n't do that much worse ? 
  now let 's check : so you 're concluding from the criminality and unemployment rate that taking in refugees had a negative impact on dutch economy ? 
  for example dutch wages declining ? 
  [ nope , apparently not ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/charts/netherlands-minimum-wages.png?s=netherlandminwag&amp;v=201607251823n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231 ) .
