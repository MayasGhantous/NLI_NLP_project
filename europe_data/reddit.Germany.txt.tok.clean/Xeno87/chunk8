  let 's check if unemployment raised after taking in refugees : [ woah ] ( http://en.actualitix.com/chart/nld/netherlands-unemployment-rate.png ) . 
  do you see what i 'm seeing ? 
  aside from oscillating , dutch unemployment rate went down in mid 80 's and mid 90 's . 
  when again was that refugee influx again ? 
  huh . 
  ok , maybe the dutch gpd went down . 
  * edit : * now , maybe the crime rates have not benefitted the netherlands socially . 
  let 's see : [ satisfaction index 7.3 , higher than oecd average of 6.5 ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/netherlands/ ) . 
  man . 
  ok , increasing wages , declining unemployment , raising gdp , high satisfaction index - yeah , you 're right , the netherlands really suck to live in after you took in refugees . 
  if you want to conclude that preventing refugees from working has a bad influence on integration and criminality - well , that 's a study to cite . 
  but if you want to conclude that taking in refugees does not benefit the hosting country , nope , then this study is completely off topic . 
   * of asylum seekers who arrived earlier , only slightly more than a third had paid work after fifteen years of living in the netherlands . 
   * asylum seekers who arrived earlier are roughly three times as likely to be involved in ( serious ) crime . 
  well , thanks for getting me a study for this . 
  now , since i do n't speak dutch , care to point me where exactly this is said in the study so i know what regions of the document i have to translate ? 
  because the entire language barrier thing makes it impossible to me mto verify this now . 
   and certainly , john oliver is not an expert on these matters . 
  no shit sherlock ? 
  but the studies he refers to were conducted by experts on these matters . 
   you poor , delusional bastard . 
  if you are too stupid to read the rest of my comment aside from john oliver and `` studies '' , then you are the most delusional bastard on earth . 
  that 's the entire fucking point of my comment . 
  if this is how you read stuff , then i 'm damn sure i will find stuff in the study you linked you have n't read , either , that will completely erradicate your point , i bet . 
  * edit * : and i 'm also interested where this sentence appears : _ `` precisely because the integration of past waves of refugees have been an enormous failure . 
  '' _ * edit2 : * and i totally forgot : this stuff is al being adressed [ in the wapo ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/10/the-big-myth-about-refugees/ ) article . 
   but refugees are n't always an economic benefit to countries . 
  the way that refugees affect their host economy depends a lot on how a country deals with them . 
  it might seem counterintuitive , but the countries that take the longest to process refugees and have the tightest restrictions on them end up paying the most per refugee  researchers emphasized that refugees have a far better impact on the local economy if they are allowed to work . 
  `` what you want to do is to process them as quickly and efficiently as possible , and to integrate them as quickly and efficiently as possible , ''  the researchers found that the danish people who lived in communities where refugees arrived saw their wages grow more quickly than those without refugees . 
  the study confirmed an effect that peri had already observed among communities that received immigrants in the u.s. and in germany . 
  not every single dane was helped by the change , peri says , but on average more people upgraded their jobs and earned higher wages . 
  so you were saying `` it got worse for the netherlands for taking in refugees '' ? 
  because that 's apparently not what this study concluded , and [ the development of wages ] ( http://www.flassbeck-economics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/n25.png ) also does not back this . 
  this study concludes that it 's bad to not let refugees work and integrate them properly , _ who would 've thought _ , while apparently making no statement at all that taking in refugees was bad for the dutch economy . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  but what the fuck . 
  what the goddamn fuck . 
  this is because this is n't the first time this has happened and we have precedents _ showing _ that it works . 
  first of all , let me start with [ a quote ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/10/the-big-myth-about-refugees/ ) :  `` there 's not any credible research that i know of that in the medium and long term that refugees are anything but a hugely profitable investment , '' this is a very strong statement , [ one which john oliver also can get behind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umqvyhb3wf4&amp;t=11m13s ) . 
  taking in refugees has _ never _ had negative impact on a developed country . 
  [ here 's another easy to understand article about that . 
  ] ( http://www.worldfinance.com/infrastructure-investment/government-policy/refugees-are-an-economic-benefit-not-burden-to-europe ) but enough of studies nobody reads anyway . 
  do you were around in 1992-1994 ? 
  because back then , there was another refugee crisis from yugoslavia . 
  headlines and articles back then for example read  [ yugoslav refugee crisis europe 's worst since 40 's ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/24/world/yugoslav-refugee-crisis-europe-s-worst-since-40-s.html )  of the 2.3 million refugees , more than 400,000 have fled to countries outside the former yugoslavia 's borders . 
  germany has admitted the largest number , 200,000 , followed by hungary , with 60,000 ; austria , with 50,000 , and sweden , with 44,000 , according to unofficial government estimates provided to the united nations agency . 
  those were the numbers in 1992 , they raised higher and higher during 93/94 . 
  [ this is what a graphic back then looked like ] ( http://www.grida.no/graphicslib/thumbs/1805c933-493c-4b85-be16-ad06eb342332/medium/refugees-and-displaced-people-from-the-former-yugoslavia-since-1991_0c5a.jpg ) . 
  [ this is what the numbers of asylum seekers for germany looks like ] ( http://muenchner-fluechtlingsrat.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eurest-14-neu.jpg ) . 
  does all this sound and look familiar ? 
  ** the yugoslavian refugee crisis from 1992-1994 was as big of a refugee crisis as the syrian one today ** . 
  and i mean it , the numbers are completely comparable , and holy fuck , even horst seehofer was around back then calling our asylum politics bad and lobbied for a much more rigorous system which , miraculously , is the same thing he did this time . 
  he actually lobbied against his own system . 
  we also had our afd equivalent back then , [ the republicans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_republicans_ ( germany \\ ) ) , who grow big during that crisis . 
  [ and we had brutal right wing extremist attacks , too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostock-lichtenhagen_riots ) . 
  and people told us that this was the end of our country , the end of our economy , that we would be foreign in our own land within years . 
  so , we took a huge amount of refugees in , an amount as large as we did now , ** and you have n't even heard about it ** , so good is our capability to take them in and integrate them . 
  do you seriously want to tell me that we weakened our economy by taking them in ? 
  because history proves otherwise . 
  * edit * : by the way , merkel was already around back then , too . 
  she was the federal minster of family affairs , senior citizens , women and youth . 
  she was deeply involved in the refugee crisis back then , she actually has knowledge about this stuff . 
  i 'm damn confident in her when she says `` wir schaffen das '' , because we already did it before . 
  and now to defend my own honor : i 'm totally anti merkel in _ everything _ else but refugee politics . 
  i gave and give her shit everytime we 're talking about something else than her refugee policies ( which does n't happen so often anymore today . . ), 
   what did work however , was storming a city hall and trying to set it on fire while everyone was still in it . 
  i 'm out of the loop , does this refer to an actual happening in this century ? 
   it 's not up for debate at all . 
  we literally are debating it right now . 
  btw , does this make you a liar now ? 
   she has been caught in many lies . 
  yeah , so often that i all you guys have a really hard to to prove it . 
   so yes by definition hillary lied just like all politicians do . 
  no , because a lie needs intent , which in this case was not given . 
  you are just childishly trying to paint her a liar because she 's your unpreferred candidate and thus holding her accountable by ridiculous standards no human being can ever fulfill . 
  you 're right , the government of kosovo , afghanistan , libya or iraq are totally sworn to the us and nato . 
  a `` blatant lie '' , huh ? 
  let 's start boring , with the definition of lie : '' _ to present false information with the intention of deceiving . _ '' so to say something while clearly knowing otherwise . 
  ok , let 's revisit that incident . 
  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/23/recalling-hillary-clintons-claim-of-landing-under-sniper-fire-in-bosnia/  i was on the plane with then first lady hillary clinton for the trip from germany into bosnia in 1996 . 
  we were put on a c-17 -- a plane capable of steep ascents and descents -- ** precisely because we were flying into what was considered a combat zone . 
  ** we were issued flak jackets for the final leg because of possible sniper fire near tuzla . 
  as an additional precaution , the ** first lady and chelsea were moved to the armored cockpit for the descent into tuzla . 
  ** ** we were told that a welcoming ceremony on the tarmac might be canceled because of sniper fire in the hills surrounding the air strip . 
  ** from tuzla , hillary flew to two outposts in bosnia with gunships escorting her helicopter . 
   among the u.s. officials on hand to greet clinton at the airport was maj. gen. william nash , commander of u.s. troops in bosnia . 
  nash told me that he was unaware of any security threat to clinton during her eight-hour stay in tuzla . 
  he said , however , that clinton had a `` busy schedule '' and may have got the impression ** that she was being hurried on her way . 
  ** ok , so there you are , on your plane , and the secret service and the army guys tell you it 's very dangerous , and then they tell you to step into the cockpit because it 's armored and you 're safe against the snipers fire down there . 
  and then you land , you are greeted but rushed away quickly and shoved into a car . 
  and then years later you speak of your impression back then and say you landed under sniper fire . 
  this is n't a lie . 
  this was the false impression she got from the vibe and accounts of the security people around her . 
  she did n't say she landed under sniper fire and knew this was n't true . 
  she said she landed under sniper fire and belived it to be true based on everything her security people told her . 
  if you call that a lie , damn , then you have a thin skin when it comes to what people experience . 
  you know what counts as a lie ? 
  here is stuff being said while clearly knowing otherwise : * [ saying you never met putin when just 3 years ago you met him in person ] ( http://www.politicususa.com/2016/07/29/trumps-lies-ties-putin-exposed-today-show.html ) . 
  * [ saying you will release your tax returns and then you do n't ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmf2yi4yut4 ) * [ saying you did n't promise 6 million dollars to vets , when in fact , you did ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/24/four-months-later-donald-trump-says-he-gave-1-million-to-veterans-group ) * [ saying you watched a video ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-mouths-iranian-video-not-exist-article-1.2737724 ) which [ actually never existed ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/ap-fact-check-trump-off-clinton-iran-payment-180458387--election.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;ref=gs ) you know what ?
