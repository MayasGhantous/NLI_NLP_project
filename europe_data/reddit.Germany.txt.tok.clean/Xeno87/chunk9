  [ here are 101 lies of donald trump ] ( http://www.dailywire.com/news/4834/trumps-101-lies-hank-berrien ) , and that 's only the shit he lied about until april . 
  if that false memory of clinton is the worst thing you have , then calling her an overly-ambitious liar is either proof that you did n't inform yourself properly , or well , a _ blatan lie _ . 
  is would even claim to have poisoned his food everytime obama has diarrhea . 
  seriously . 
  people give the us or nato shit for military interventions , but damn , they actually leave those countries again . 
  they do n't install puppet regimes or just right out extend their border . 
  but russia ? 
  it clings to the regions it sends its soldiers to never let them go again or just makes the region a wasteland . 
  putins russia is the most scary thing to happen to europe since the second world war . 
  also , should focus on your reading abilities . 
  so long , redditor for a month . 
  good to see that there are still sane people in russia . 
  all the putin spam , trump shilling or ukraine propaganda posts make you easily forget that not the entire russian population is like this . 
   redditor for a month  88.3 % comment karma on r/the _ dipshit oh god , the shilling is real here . 
  seriously , a subreddit run and moderated by the media portal breitpart for trump is the definition of shilling . 
  maybe you should get out of your safe space and hang around more on subs where opposing opinions do n't get banned immediatly . 
  i like that basically every negative thing `` people '' say about hillary is always lies . 
  it really is a strong compliment when your enemies need to make stuff up to portray you as bad . 
  ok , since you probably do n't know that this picture shows the countries military budgets and you most likely also do n't understand why the american military budget includes positions that are not included in the military budget of other countries ( such as coast guard ) , i 'll give you a bit of reality that you are most likely too young to remember : even though not a single nato country was attacked or the mutual defense clause was triggered , [ nato intervened in yugoslavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ) , just like it also [ had multiple operations throughout its history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_operations ) that were never tirggered because of an attack on a member country . 
  your idea that when a eu member state that is also a nato ally was engaged in a war against a foreign agressor state without other nato allies joining and supporting is naive to a degree i ca n't describe with words . 
   that 's about 80 % of the nato budget . 
  from all the things that are wrong or not considered in your comment , this is the wrongest . 
  [ it would be 39 % . 
  ] ( http://www.taxpayer.net/images/uploads/nato%20budget%20pie%20chart%202.png ), 
  [ eu treaty , article 42 , paragraph 7 ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_european_union/title_v:_general_provisions_on_the_union%27s_external_action_service_and_specific_provisions_on_the_common_foreign_and_security_policy#article_42 ) :  if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  this shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
  an attack on an eu member would result into the nato member states of the eu being dragged into war . 
  even though it is no direct nato case of alliance , nato would be involved . 
  it 's as if the nazis had come back from the dead into the internet age to finish the job . 
  nope , valuable context . 
  whataboutism would be : what about putin financing ** the entire extremist party spectrum in europe ? 
  ** what about russia hacking the democrats to make his puppet trump win the elections ? 
  also : `` redditor since 5 months '' . 
  we should just nuke olgino . 
  [ i 'm sure they verify their antisemitism just as good as their `` information '' ] ( http://heatst.com/politics/wikileaks-posts-and-deletes-anti-semitic-tweet-as-it-does-putins-bidding-for-trump/ ) . 
  but welp , trump support , redditor since 8 months and pro russia ? 
  holy fuck who would 've thought . 
  you 're a russian troll , infa 100 % . 
  ah , trump supporters . 
  too illiterate to read the comment chain . 
  which is really sad , considering that they had quite some credibility in the beginning . 
  but ever since assange met with russian officials and then suddenly abandoned his plans to release `` major information about putin and medvedev , it has become what you just said . 
  [ lol , educate yourself a bit about what an antisemitic , russian controlled shitfest wikileaks is ] ( http://heatst.com/politics/wikileaks-posts-and-deletes-anti-semitic-tweet-as-it-does-putins-bidding-for-trump/ ), 
  ... all while it is distracting that russia is much , _ much _ more influencing european and the us elections . 
  this here is intended to distract from what russia is doing . 
   you make it sound like they have all the data and are simply not releasing it . 
  then you read that wrong . 
  i was implying that wikileaks , end especially assange , are merely working for russias interests and support even their absurdest conspiracy theories . 
  [ stuff like that . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/492033939142619136?lang=de ) * edit * : oh , also [ the faked image shown in russian media , source wikileaks ] ( https://i1.wp.com/www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/satellite_overlay01.jpg?ssl=1 ) . 
  i think it 's a good time to repost the [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughtrumpspam/comments/4xdlpl/imagine_if_julian_assange_put_this_much_effort/d6ewbyx ) by / u/it _ could_happen_here :  remember back in 2010 , assange [ publicly announced he had a massive bombshell about putin , medvedev , and russian oligarchs ? ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2010/1026/wikileaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-russia.-but-will-russians-get-to-read-about-it ) . 
  then he met with russian officials , dropped the story , and refused to mention it again . 
  [ now he hosts a show on rt ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/rt-assange-show-wikileaks-125/ ) ( russia today , the kremlin 's english-language propaganda arm ) , where he regularly pushes right-wing russian talking points . 
  in one [ particularly brutal piece ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/julian-assange-rafael-correa-ecuador-769/ ) , he praises ecuador 's government for crushing freedom of the press and attempting to nationalize all journalism ( render all of ecuador 's media state-controlled ) , because `` the bankers own the ecuadorian papers and they 're bad for ecuador . '', 
   additionally , he [ regularly praises bashar al-assad ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/assange-hezbollah-nasrallah-syria-263/ ) , using talking points identical to those used by the stein-baraka green party ticket . 
  icymi , jill stein has also praised putin [ and even dined with him at a dinner honoring russia today ] ( https://twitter.com/zatchry/status/762055852991713280 ) . 
  at the same table as stein and putin , was michael flynn , donald trump 's military advisor . 
  now assange publishes article after article warning that `` imperialist media '' will try to `` smear '' jill stein . 
  ca n't tell if sarcasm or not . 
  just like they showed evidence of ukraine downing mh17 . 
   but it does explain the motivation . 
  nope . 
  during the 2008 nato summit in bucharest where georgia and ukraine applied for nato membership , putin ( yes , he was there ) spoke about those two countries having `` a lot of russian citizens '' and that regions such as crimea or abkhasia could break away should those countries join nato . 
  everyone with a little bit of knowledge back then interepreted it as an open threat . 
  germany , france and great britain vote 'd their application ** out of concerns about russia 's interests ** . 
  the fact that russia still attacked them is proof that a _ not _ expanding nato is the reason for russia 's brutal treatment of georgia and ukraine . 
  ok , putinists told me that nato is now allowed to do a 100.000 soldier manoeuvre and deploy offensive long range weapons . 
  this is what happens when you do n't ban russia from swift . 
  there was just a democratic election if i won our debate , it resulted in a 85,2 \u2105 win for me . 
   officially elected government in syria lol, 
  and if you 'd inform yourself you 'd know that western forced bombing a hospital are unique instances , while russia does this and targeting refugee camps actively , with cluster bombs ands what not . 
  then this piece of shit country single handedly prevented the ban of barrell bombs and allows assad to use chemicals weapons . 
  i 'd rather have the guys that do one mistake instead of the guys that chose to work like the nazis . 
  also , since syria has a dictators and russia is backing him , russia equals nazi germany . 
  my point ? 
  when it comes to treating people like human beings , there are no prizes for trying . 
  if you want to convince me that russia is just like any other country , then try to make it miraculously go a decade without making its border bigger , the ones of its neighbors smaller , opposing politicians and journalists dying like flies and human rights watch warning of being gay and going there . 
  until then i will treat it like the shithole it is . 
   as i tried to explain above i 'm not comparing the refugees with the casualties of your genocide . 
  dude , that 's harsh . 
   lso since when all of them are actual refugees ? 
  how many are just from pakistan , afghanistan etc. 
  how many a fit young males which are economic immigrants ? 
  please get you head out of your ass for a minute . 
  it 's up to _ our _ border guards and officials to decide , not up to you . 
  because they have the necessary information to decide about that , you do n't . 
   also if you remember history not only jews died there however your masters thought you well who to b\u043ew to first . 
   after the war you see your mothers and fathers were forced to visit the camps and witness the horrors . 
  go on ...  most were unaware of that camps existed , most of your population did n't question the policies and followed them blindly . 
  _ everyone _ knew . 
   today it 's quite similar ... your country is risking the whole continent by the policies and it seems most germans failed to care about the implications and the extent of the damage in \u0430 long term . 
  you cared only not to be called racist which is so deeply embedded in your minds that yes it 's a german complex . 
  lol , that 's probably the worst interpretation of german politics i 've ever read . 
  damn , you live up to your username 100 % . 
  how about you read a book . 
  no seriously , _ read a history book _ . 
  and then some diaries of the 30 's and 40 's . 
  you have a lot of stuff to read up to , because you know less than someone who has all his history education from history channel . 
  [ is of terrific , comrade . 
  no problems chere .
