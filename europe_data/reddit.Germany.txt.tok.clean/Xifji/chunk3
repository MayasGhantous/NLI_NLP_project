  gee , i wonder why english has words like village , pork , beef , blonde or theatre ... 
  surely because they were never conquered by the french !, 
  invade france , the russians are up to something !, 
  democracy is like a train , you get off when you are where you want to be . 
  this . 
  clearly the french have to be stupid and/or evil not to leave the eu , if the eu is such a bad thing . 
  feet do n't plough unless you drag them . 
  what is that , why should one want to have it and is it only produced in turkey ? 
  are you polish ? 
  russian roulette, 
  i have stopped buying stuff from turkey in the supermarket . 
  relevant username, 
  pun intended ? 
  do n't worry , we 're nice now ,

  where do the women go ? 
  he does n't propose banning all mosques . 
  dear anglosphere : please note the absence of scat porn in germany . 
  even when trying to fix a leak ? 
  feels  reals, 
  for things like creating a map like the one we talk about , i 'm more in favour of interpreting languages as dialect continuums with more or less variation , regardless of how the dialects have come to be historically . 
  it is ridiculous to say that thuringian , bavarian and swabian are different languages spoken in germany and even in norway , where there is more dialectal variety : having a three gender system and a two gender system in two dialects do n't make them two separate languages . 
  he also has about a dozen more bones than other people , because his brain still works mechanically . 
  what do you think the uncensored description was ? 
  yeah , i do n't agree with this tendency to classify every dialect as a new language entirely . 
  do i speak a different language from you , if you say semmel and i say br\u00f6tchen ? 
  i 'd argue not . 
  not to mention he even erased the faroe islands from the map entirely . 
  i 've heard and said heil hitler in germany . 
  you 're just not allowed to use symbols of the nsdap in public , and this greeting is one of them . 
  you do n't have to carry an id card in germany . 
  you just have to have one . 
  far right : when the holocaust never happened but you kind of want it to happen again . 
  meine arme mutter !, 
  :'d what does that even mean ? 
  nobody attacks their own money . 
  to be fair : he delivered the speech to a hand-picked audience and made the connection total war = shortest war , at a time at which most people already noticed that being at war is a bad thing . 
  a friend told me a story about how he met two guys looking for bombs in a field that was going to be made into a park . 
  they would go around with a metal detector , guess the weight of the object and depth it was at and then just start to dig it up with a pickaxe . 
  he asked them if they were sure about the depth and if they were n't afraid of hitting something much closer to the surface than they thought . 
  they simply shrugged and said : `` we are n't sure . 
  but we get paid a lot extra for the risk . '', 
  the austrians are at it again !, 
  my grandma was in a firebombed city in wwii and had to flee the bunker she was in , because it caught fire . 
  she says there were streams of burning phosphorus running down the streets as she was looking for shelter . 
  other relatives of mine said , they could see the city burning , even though they were 60km away . 
  it can not have been a pleasant thing for anyone involved . 
  a couple of years ago they found a big bomb that had n't gone off under the train station of this city when they redid the tracks . 
  interesting information when you 've taken the train dozens of times there . 
  last year , they tore up a street my dad drives over daily , because the british secret service released some aerial photographs that let investigators to believe , there were still undetonated bombs under it . 
  ironically , the main tank factory in the city was never hit , and a friend of mine works there today . 
  would work even better for germany . 
  well , it 's an ancient tradition in the saarland , that if you have a sibling of the opposite sex , you try to seduce them . 
  kastenkopf / kanistersch\u00e4del are the ones i 've heard, 
  to be fair , you 're still more likely to die in a regular accident in these cities . 
  :'( just keep the saarland , but leave the rest, 
  you should receive german citizenship immediately , judging from your username . 
  not that i 'm aware of , sorry . 
  but i 'm sure we can arrange something . 
  would be only fair for you to use it , because we use `` boxhead '' for russians or eastern europeans sometimes, 
  i like that better than `` the mute ones '' actually :d, 
  ... settled by mountain-germans , it all makes sense !, 
  should be 1994 for germany https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paragraph_175, 
  i wonder why ... maybe because every time it is used , someone comes along `` hurr durr holocaust !!!! 11 !! einself ! '', 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i 'm sure all the 18,2 million people who served in the wehrmacht were hardcore nazis until the end of their life . ^ / s, 
  and that would be a good thing because ... ? 
  if that 's how you say it in polish or estonian :d, 
  some men just want to see the world burn , do n't they ? 
  who would you like to replace assad ? 
  these translations are retarded . 
  it 's like translating `` retarded '' with `` re tar dead '' or something . 
  could it possibly be h\u00e4rn-\u00f6-sand , instead of h\u00e4r-n\u00f6s-and ? 
  you 've never been to the faroe islands , no ? 
  holy shit !, 
  seriously , why does nobody question this bullshit ? 
  can we please invade the vatican , kill the last absolute monarch of europe , make the archives available to historians and the rest of it a huge museum ? 
  not throwing a shit-fit about something is now censorship . 
  more like [ 6,500 bce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doggerland ), 
  the danish basically just summarises the german ... 
  calling these people `` politicians '' is a bit of a stretch at this point . 
  they 'll probably start stealing food from ukraine . 
  do n't stay too long . 
  you 'll know the place in like two days ... 
  you got that wrong !, 
  the benevolent and secretive bankers stored the jewish gold away safely , so the nazis could n't get it . 
  that 's why it is very important never to talk to the german ministry of finance !, 
  in fact , we 're the only language that still does it . 
  the danes were the last to stop doing it . 
  german is a west-germanic language . 
  looks about right , also have a look here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_abductions i imagine the same guys also went to the faroes , but i have trouble finding english sources about that . 
  they were raided by moroccans themselves , actually ( a couple of centuries ago ) . 
  that 's exactly the issue . 
  we have very little information about continental germanic religion and a bit more about the norse religion . 
  they were very close culturally , but there also were differences . 
  well , simply speaking , ibn fadlan travelled more in slavic areas than germanic ones .
