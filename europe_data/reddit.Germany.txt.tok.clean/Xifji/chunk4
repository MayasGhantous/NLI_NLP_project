  so we get some information from him , but it is not a lot . 
  simek : religion der germanen maier : die religion der germanen, 
  well , since we have no texts about germanic religion except from norse and latin literature , it 's a bit hard to tell . 
  linking archeological finds to religion and religious practices is also a bit challenging . 
  while it 's pretty established that scandinavians also worshipped indoors , what we know about the continental germanic religion seems to suggest that they mainly worshipped outdoors ( forests and swamps , if i remember correctly ) . 
  i 've read some books on this topic , but they 're all in german . 
  how big will the images be in saarland-sizes ? 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66v9md/great_warriorsphilosophers_of_europe_ernst_j\u00fcnger/?st=j1t4005i&amp;sh=d125f53d ), 
  i recommend watching the documentary [ 102 years in the heart of europe : a portrait of ernst j\u00fcnger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ju5hfod20u ), 
  please read the wikipedia article i linked . 
  hitler clearly distinguishes the muslim religion and the arab race and expresses his regret , that the germans did not take up islam . 
  i guess the thought of them trying to kill you and turning your country into a soviet province helps with that . 
  i 'm not brave enough yet , but i 'd probably go for ernst j\u00fcnger . 
  [ looky here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr7d1stdnts ), 
  in case of an extremist muslim takeover of france , those high buildings could be used to throw gays to their deaths . 
  voting fn may be perceived as working against hypothetical takeover . 
  have a look here :  in speeches , hitler made apparently warm references towards muslim culture such as : `` the peoples of islam will always be closer to us than , for example , france '' ... [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relations_between_nazi_germany_and_the_arab_world#hitler.27s_views_on_islam] and also here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fo99fismoi, 
  yeah , i see where you 're coming from now . 
  americans probably see it like you as an interesting ancestry/genealogy-thing , but to many europeans the things you brought up sound like nazi-style obsession with race . 
  but ancestry is completely irrelevant to this discussion . 
  i would n't be happy if the next generation are identical clones to this one , but are , let 's say , cannibals or something . 
  then you 're making an incredibly bad argument , since europeans are genetically speaking still from pre-indo-european stock . 
  yet indo-european languages and culture have conquered the majority of europe .

  not really sure what dna has to do with civilisation, 
  the thing with sch\u00e4uble is , that he is probably one of the smartest and most capable people in our government ( or at least appears to be ) , but his positions are usually not so good . 
  any story someone might tell in order to get me to pull my wallet out is a major red flag . 
  i found an online game where you have to do this . 
  the heartland and new england were difficult for me , the rest went kinda ok . 
  ok , believe me or not , i 'll actually try this . 
  1 alabama , 2 mississippi , 3 lousiana , 4 texas , 5 oklahoma , 6 maryland , 7 kansas , 8 arkansas , 9 north carolina , 10 south carolina , 11 maine , 12 washington , 13 vermont , 14 california , 15 utah , 16 nevada , 17 new york , 18 colorado , 19 arizona , 20 iowa , 21 ohio , 22 west virginia , 23 alaska , 24 hawaii , 25 florida , 26 washington dc , 27 massachusetts , 28 missouri , 29 minnesota , 30 michigan , 31 oregon ... that was typed in like 3-5 minutes from the top of my head, 
  rabbi or not , being killed is pretty shitty . 
  these people elect a president who commands a military with bases in most of those countries . 
  scary stuff . 
  if there is no god , why should they believe in him ? 
  is n't it true that every party who later won the election offered tax cuts ? 
  indeed it comes from the same - s the latin - us ( as in amicus ) comes from, 
  [ kekkonen ^ kekkonen ^ kekkonen ^ kekkonen ^ kekkonen ^ kekkonen ^ kekkonen ^ kekkonen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjt-aejkzf0 ), 
  it does n't mean `` popular men / populous land '' . 
  `` deutsch '' describes the language the populace speaks , in contrast to latin . 
  `` deutschland '' would be the area people speak that language in . 
  in fact , avoid the word `` jude '' completely when speaking german . 
  nothing good can come out of it . 
  i only know `` franz\u00f6sische verabschiedung '' ( french farewell ) , for leaving without telling anyone . 
  i was just pretending to be offended because german has articles and cases , too . 
  ooooooh , be careful in germany , man, 
   how bizarre it is to have both cases and articles i beg your pardon ? 
  you just bought 1000 liters of milk . 
  d\u00f6ner , j\u00e4gerschnitzel , ahle wurscht and sauerkraut and for iceland : whale and horse steak, 
  the state monopoly store that sells alcohol, 
  using grammatically correct german when ordering a d\u00f6ner . 
  it is * ein d\u00f6ner mit alles * , i do n't care that you are a native speaker , murat , * mit alles * !, 
  j\u00e4gerschnitzel is best schnitzel , sorry austria . 
  i think wienerisch is the best way to speak german . 
  in recorded history , there was never a safer time for europe . 
  in germany you can ask the local forest administration for a permit or ask a farmer , if you can camp on some field . 
  everything else outside a camping ground is illegal afaik . 
  it 's a much more densely populated country than norway , so we have to protect the forest from people . 
  ne , he meant the sz thing . 
  \u00df is used, 
  i first learned swedish , then i met swedish people other than my teacher . 
  and i 'm sure my teacher is also able to give a professional opinion . 
  and , not to brag here , but as someone who speaks 4 languages fluently , 1 not so fluently , and is able to understand 9 , i think i can determine whether i am fluent in a language or not . 
  yep , corrected it . 
  thanks . 
  i passed tests , i understand everything swedish i encounter , i am understood , i know swedish people who are honest to me . 
  i ment getting by as a tourist . 
  if you live here permanently , you should , of course , learn ~ ~ english ~ ~ german . 
  [ edit : typo ] and i was able to become a fluent speaker of english and swedish , without living in the countries or having a tandem partner . 
  i also understand norwegian perfectly fine and danish to a high degree . 
  never set a foot in these countries , or had a tandem partner either . 
  it certainly helps , but it 's not necessary . 
  i go to a german university . 
  there are tons of americans with bad german skills around . 
  some programs do n't require german at all . 
  just going from the language , german would be easier for an english speaker to learn . 
  but motivation is key . 
  if you 're far more motivated to learn russian , learn russian . 
  with those two languages , you do n't have to live in the country in order to learn it . 
  there is plenty of material and speakers you can get hold of wherever you are . 
  is it necessary to learn german ? 
  if you want to get by in germany - no . 
  if you want to do business with germans - maybe , there still are a lot of people that ca n't use english productively in a business context . 
  and of course , if you are interested in german culture , literature or film , you should learn the language . 
  care to give an example ? 
  who will be the opposing parties in this civil war ? 
  if your thinking about taking a bus like most people recommend , please have a look at the travel times . 
  you might save a few euros , but also spend 3x the time . 
  same here . 
  i went to school with a lot of volga germans , they were pretty cool . 
  she was born after that . 
  but i admit , it 's kind of an asshole thing to tell someone you do n't want to learn their language . 
  the only thing i can think of is poles being angry about their country being divided into german and russian provinces so often . 
  so maybe he took it as `` hey , you 're a german satellite state , you speak german , right ? '', 
  might be , i once told a pole i would rather learn russian than polish . 
  she was extremely butthurt . 
  you have just summoned lucifer . 
  best one yet . 
  most germans would probably say the same . 
  why was he offended ?
