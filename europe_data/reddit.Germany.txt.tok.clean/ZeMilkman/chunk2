  if a child abductor is caught and they wo n't give up details on the location of their victim i would be fully in support of using violence to gather the necessary information . 
  if a terrorist is caught and tortured to gather information which are immediately relevant to the safety of innocent people i wo n't blame the people responsible for said torture . 
  the job of the government should be to protect the innocent and remove threats and when someone is corrupted to the point of murdering , raping , battering people i do n't think we should take any chances . 
  i think we should remove that threat once and for all , just like i would put down a rabid dog without harboring any anger towards it . 
  i disagree . 
  i think we should allow them back into europe and simply reintroduce the death penalty . 
  i do n't think they should suffer because i 'm not a sadist and i do n't think the government should be allowed to inflict pain without a good reason ( yes i think sometimes torture is a valid means to an end ) but i do think these people need to be removed from the face of the earth . 
  yeah but if you went to berlin you 'd realize why hamburg is actually a better city . 
  yeah , but now that germany is on your side and we kind of owe you a favor for the whole wwii thing , who 's gon na do it ? 
  here 's an idea : just let germany peacefully annex you . 
  boom russia wo n't even think about it anymore !, 
  http://www.polizeiautos.de/index_db.php?bereich=land and here are all the different police cars in use in germany sorted by state . 
  yeah ... 
  i 'm sure they are right . 
  archfoe and archfriend . 
  should work . 
   least favourite : germany not cool . 
  we love the shit out of you guys . 
  attack kills 1 , injures 15 nato soldiers . 
  1 german , 12 americans . 
  i feel like russia should sanction germany . 
  just because i wan na see them show whether they actually have balls . 
  it 's easy fucking with ukraine . 
  it 's easy fucking with poland . 
  it 's easy fucking with most of europe but you go ahead russia , pick on someone your own size . 
  go ahead , sanction germany , sanction france , sanction the uk . 
  well , that does sound like a terrible idea . 
  you know ** roman ** ia could have been a pretty good hint . 
  you know . 
  like ** roman ** s. from ** rom ** e, 
  oh god . 
  polish food . 
  delicious ham , delicious sausages , delicious everything . 
  nothing of what you said showed any understanding of what i said . 
  you are clearly an idiot . 
   if gay people have to endure all those straight sex ads on the internet and the constant straight phone sex ads on tv day in and day out , well you should then be able to tolerate their leather panties parade and just walk the other way if it disturbs you so much . 
  fuck you . 
  there are plenty of gay phone sex ads on tv and the straight sex ads are probably not much more annoying to them than they are to the average straight person ( which is fucking annoying ) . 
  gay pride parades take place in public spaces and while i think gay people should have equal rights and all that shit , i disagree with their exhibitionistic performances at parades . 
  it cheapens their whole cause . 
  except the ones dancing up there do n't have a cause . 
  they are attention whores , getting off on the idea that they are special . 
  exactly . 
  everyone loved it !, 
  i think we should get 2018 . 
  brazil can get 2022 again . 
  smart . 
  it would pay for itself in no-time . 
  well . 
  if i had a say that thing would fly a german flag and blast the ode to joy all day long . 
   sarcasm is not the rapier of wit its wielders seem to believe it to be , but merely a club : it may , by dint of brute force , occasionally raise bruises , but it never cuts or pierces . 
  that 's the problem when you give psychologist the status of academic professionals . 
  you should look up some topics of psychology dissertations . 
  most of them are inane bullshit you can figure out by watching someone for 5 minutes . 
  sometimes you have to do the right thing , whether it 'll be fun or not . 
  yeah . 
  when i found out about the setup of the bosch corporation i started factoring that into my decision-making when buying new stuff and bosch offers the kind of product i need . 
  robert bosch wants to disagree . 
  so ... is the hate of brazilians not a stereotypical portuguese trait ? 
  so many portuguese people i know hate brazilians . 
  [ nooo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshko8hqq10 ) you guys are definitely german . 
  what 's up with the hate ? 
   northern europeans are perfect and are superior in every aspect to southern and eastern people . 
  so , got any romanian chicks you want to introduce me to ? 
  i wish i 'd like wine so i could come live with you people . 
  i am pretty much for an all-or-nothing approach . 
  i do n't believe in the concept of incarceration as a method of punishment . 
  and you ca n't tell me that when you make a sentence dependent on the crime , it 's about `` rehabilitation '' . 
  it 's about punishing someone for an amount of time which correlates to how egregious you think their crime was . 
  i think it 's perfectly fine to sentence people to community service for crimes like theft , burglary , vandalism and the like . 
  i think crimes when people got hurt should give someone therapy sessions and community service , still no incarceration though as long as they show up to both . 
  i think crimes which display a malicious personal disposition should be treated in secure psychiatric facilities but in a manner which treats people as patients . 
  they should be able to do community service under supervision . 
  people who are determined to be incapable of being rehabilitated should be put to death . 
  i do n't care about deterring people . 
  i want those people to die because society should not be forced to waste resources on people who will never be able to be safely released and people should not live out their lives incarcerated . 
  i actually think incarcerating someone for the rest of their lives clashes with the very first article of the german constitution . 
   ( 1 ) human dignity shall be inviolable . 
  to respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority . 
  edit because i just completely ignored the torture aspect : no . 
  torture wo n't work on people trained to resist torture and i agree we should not use it on enemy combatants or in cases where less aggressive approaches will work better but every once in a while there is a case where you find the criminal but not the victim who may or may not be alive . 
  when there is sufficient evidence of the person in custody being the criminal and they refuse to cooperate to save the life of their victim , i think torture is a perfectly good method to save the life of an innocent person . 
  personally i do n't have an issue with either the death penalty or torture ( if it is necessary to prevent future danger , not simply to torture someone ) . 
  i think traitors should be publicly executed and thrown into a ditch somewhere in the middle of nowhere . 
  if something is `` slightly off '' that 's a well done voice-over . 
  agreed . 
   overall sorry if i came off as a dick in my first post , i just get very heated on the subject of african immigration to the 1st world and i hate this idea of `` not our continent , not our problem '' . 
  it 's in europe , america , canada and pretty much every 1st world country 's interest to help shitty places like africa get better cos it will benefit us all . 
  it 's not like we started out with `` not our continent , not our problem '' . 
  we started out with `` lets give them money and offer them education '' africa took the money , refused the education and they did that over and over and over and over and just like at some point you stop giving your crack-addicted brother money because you know he will just spend it on crack again europe needs to stop giving money to africa because there is no fucking point in trying to help africa until africa wants to accept our help . 
  and our help is not just money , not just education , our help is also a culture . 
  a culture where people have rights , where kids go to school , not work , where you do n't take community property ( generators , solar cells , water pumps and filters ) and sell it off for scraps just so you are a little more well off for a few weeks . 
  once africa , or a majority of africans change their minds and embrace human rights , democracy , education , a legal system and so on europe should go back to helping them . 
  europe should educate doctors , engineers , teachers , construction workers and all that to help africa . 
  but europe ca n't succeed in helping africa unless africa sincerely wants our help and africans are willing to stand up and fight for democracy . 
  see all those guys on the boat ? 
  i 'm sure if they wanted a better life for everyone , they could unite , they could build a community , they could work together to make their country better . 
  they could reach out to any of the thousands of big and small charities who provide education and resources instead of money . 
  they could arm themselves to defend their community against thugs . 
  there is a lot of things they could do besides running away .
