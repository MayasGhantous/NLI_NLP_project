  no you are going to explain this to them by letting them in , giving them a place to rest for a night or two , putting them on a ship and boating them back over to their place of origin . 
  exception : if they can prove they are politically prosecuted or face a greater threat than their average country man . 
  fix your own fucking home . 
  do i come to your house and tell you `` well if you want me to leave you will need to fix my house first . 
  it kind of burned down after you came by that one time and you broke my chair and then you left me money to repair that chair but i used it for crack and then i asked you for more money and you gave me enough to buy a whole set of chair but i also spent that on crack and then when i was smoking my crack i needed to put it down somewhere but you broke the chair so i set it down on a stack of gasoline-soaked newspapers an my house burned down so fix it . '', 
  like a colony ? 
  oh no , how shocking , how very unusual . 
  i am in awe . 
  was n't the premise that his cancer was considered terminal and that he wanted his family to have some money once he was gone ? 
  seems to make perfect sense to me . 
  flu shot , half a million . 
  it may not be ideal but it 's alot better than the approach most parents take these days . 
  `` is sweden [ . . ] '' that 's happening everywhere . 
  you know why ? 
  because these days you ca n't hit a kid when they deserve it . 
  not as a parent but as someone who the little shitheads annoy the fuck out of . 
  when i was a kid we did n't talk shit to older kids because we 'd get smacked if we did and it 's a good thing . 
  when a kid does something stupid , unacceptable you give em a little something so they remember not to do it next time and they 'll learn something . 
  now when older kids slap younger kids for being the little shitheads they are they are bullies and can expect to be `` disciplined '' because they are `` bullies '' . 
  fuck those little asswipes , fuck their incompetent parents and fuck society for ostracizing people when they scold kids who are n't their own . 
  just 3 weeks ago i was at a shop and one of the little fuckers kicked me in the shin . 
  not by accident either . 
  i asked him whether he would like it if someone kicked him in the shin and suddenly the mother who ignored her shithead the whole time could pay attention and says if i threaten her child again she 's calling the police . 
  what the fuck you stupid whore , if you ca n't raise your child to not be an asshole , be thankful i 'm not just kneeing him in his smug little face when he kicks me but instead making him think about why he should n't do it . 
  my mothers commentary went something like `` that guy is getting shot '' then during the wavy flag performance thingy `` that 's another guy dead '' then when the chinese athletes held up the next team by just standing there `` those snowmen are gon na get shot '' . 
  i think she said that a few more times . 
  i think the word you are looking for is apology , not excuse . 
  i 'd agree if that was 30 % of the total population but if that 's the eastern population who are and have been supportive of closer relationships with russia instead of the eu that 's a lot . 
  at least they are open about the fact that they are assholes . 
  well , at least they did n't attack police stations with the sole intent of injuring and/or killing police officers like the left wing terrorists in my city . 
  so now we have to to clean up your mess . 
  thanks obama . 
  they do that because those are the people who try to push their bullshit minority opinion on everyone by using violence . 
  hamburg here , we are still pretty close and have the advantage of living in a city . 
  it 's because he is a pathetic clown . 
  he neither knows how to time his actions to make him seem like he 's in charge nor does he actually command any respect . 
  france really fucked themselves out of public international relevance when they elected him . 
  that only works for container files , not encrypted partitions . 
  there is no test for it . 
  entirely different concept . 
  that 'd be samthandschuhe ( velvet gloves ) in german . 
  fingerspitzengef\u00fchl has several context-dependant translations . 
  in this case the context requires you to basically list all of them . 
  i 'd say `` it requires a lot of awareness , skill , sensitivit , tact and caution '', 
  military style rainbow beret . 
  soldiers of equality . 
  no offense to austria but i do n't think austrian foreign minister is really such an important position . 
  besides that most ministers are stubborn old people who think they are experts and like to ignore advice from actual experts . 
  this guy will have an opinion but considering his background and accomplishments so far i think it 's safe to assume that he 'll take into account both the facts and opinions of consulting experts even if they differ from his . 
  age will just turn you white , not wise . 
   they also claim that a paper-mache plane they made is their new super secret stealth fighter jet . 
  well that 's not neceesarily a lie . 
  i love how they pretend we could n't just make a currency which is completely interchangeable with the euro . 
  you know a war would just strengthen germanys economy considering we are the third largest arms exporter in the world . 
  there is no winning . 
  great job picking out a single point which is still invalid because when prostitution is involved 17 year olds are considered children internationally . 
  i am however not going to engage with you any further because you are clearly delusional . 
  the problem is that he is clearly a criminal with a diverse portfolio ( tax fraud , extortion , child prostitution , abuse of power to circumvent the judicial branch ) who is friends with and hires people who were charged with and found guilty of colluding with the mafia and yet here you are telling me he 's just not that evil . 
  your prime minister is a xenophobic , criminal , corrupt piece of shit , this has been known for a while , yet he gets reelected time and time again . 
  some of the cases against him were dropped because his party passed laws to shorten the statue of limitations ** while there was an ongoing trial ** . 
  how do you not see that this completely ruins any credibility the italian government may have ever had ? 
  how do you not understand that when a people reelect someone like that it gives everyone the impression that this kind of behavior is alright ? 
  you usually do n't have a `` problem '' with corruption in your daily life . 
  corruption is when you pay the policeman personally 100 $ so he does n't have your car towed . 
  corruption is when you get a public contract because you bought the decision maker a car . 
  corruption is when public officials put their own personal gain above the law and regulations , it does n't necessarily cause immediate problems for most people in their everyday life . 
  totally makes sense , especially considering 9 of the 13 datasources used to compile this list are compiled by experts and not by surveying the general population . 
  and i do n't think any northern european country has anyone even close to similar to berlusconi . 
  so how about you try to look at the situation realistically ? 
  because they are smarter than you 'd think !, 
  spaniards are afraid of germans . 
  yes but that just mean we need to educate the immigrant children better . 
  however without forcing our language or culture on them because cultural tolerance . 
   someone has little testes ftfy, 
  so you are actually telling me you believe that mixing 3-4 ingredients and turning it into one of maybe a hundred shapes is on the same level as precisely designing , manufacturing and assembling even a single car model ? 
  here is what i believe : it maybe takes a year or two to learn how to make the perfect pasta , it take multiple years to become a junior engineer , it takes even more years to gain the experience to be able to even design the engine of a car , never mind the chassis , the interior , the gearbox and all the other little parts you are not even thinking about when you look at a car as a layman . 
  and you do that everytime with every new model while pasta never changes . 
  you find a recipe you subjectively think is best ( not like you can measure the quality of pasta objectively like you can with torque , acceleration , aerodynamics ) and you just keep making your pasta that way . 
  i say  pasta lives through the sauce you say  only a german is dumb enough to eat boiled pasta on its own . 
  every pasta is made with sauce you say  ketchup is revolting i say there are thousands of different ketchups , making a blanket statement like that just displays that you are ranting against ketchup out of principle instead of having an actual opinion on different kinds of ketchups . 
  plus even if there was just one kind of ketchup , on what authority do you call it revolting ? 
  shall i go around and tell people putting any kind of fish-based sauce on their pasta is revolting because i do n't enjoy the taste of fish ? 
  and you have the audacity to call ** me ** snobbish ? 
  you say  of course your people are used to a miserable diet and you are far too unimaginative to make a nice sauce i say i 'll take you on in a sauce duel any day . 
  provided of course you do n't bring your mamas recipe book but prove your own imagination . 
   so you pour ketchup on your pasta while talking loudly about how unamerican you all are when , really , you are as culturally retarded as they are . 
  personally i prefer living in a country which still has its brightest days ahead than one which is long past its climax . 
   ever been to german restaurant abroad ? 
  oh right , there are none . 
  obviously that 's not true plus why would i go to a german restaurant when i am abroad ? 
  i can cook every german dish i enjoy to subjective perfection . 
  it really is n't . 
  pick one where a slice costs more than 2 $ if you want good pizza . 
  well italians really are anal and pretentious about pasta considering that most pasta is made following the same exact recipe and just made into different shapes . 
  there was a short report on a `` master pasta maker '' on german tv and the guy was such a laughable douche . 
  first he lets a computer controlled machine weigh and mix the two or three ingredients , so no skill there , then his boss tells him which shape they need to produce that day and he puts the correct nozzles on the machine ( like you ca n't learn that in an hour ) and then he puts the pasta in a climate controlled room at an exactly controlled humidity and temperature for a specific time . 
  then non-surprisingly the pasta comes out as it always does , he his boss and everyone else tastes it and acts like it 's the best food they ever had and a machine packages into tiny , pretentious packages , he then drives around on his vespa and delivers the stuff to high-end restaurants . 
  the best part is that they looked disgusted when the german tv show put bolognese sauce on spaghetti and acted like it was some kind of cardinal sin . 
  it 's pasta you assholes . 
  you know every pasta tastes the fucking same , you make pasta and it 's always the same recipe .
