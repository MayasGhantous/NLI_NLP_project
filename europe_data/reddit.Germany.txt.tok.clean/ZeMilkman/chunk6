   and maybe drinking liters of beer is just not their thing . 
  you know this is a pathetic argument . 
   were/are the immigrants that bad , though ? 
  they are rarely in the news over here . 
  there is a huge unwillingness to assimilate within the turkish community in germany . 
  a lot of turks want the economic advantages of germany while not adapting to the culture at all . 
  a lot of them ( even the ones who are born here ) speak very broken german . 
  a lot of them feel like they are being treated unfairly by society and they respond by ignoring unwritten and written rules and laws and secluding themselves . 
  what they fail to realize is that they are being treated the same as others who are disruptive . 
  what contributes to the problem is that german citizens and politicians especially are incredibly afraid of seeming xenophobic and therefore back down when turks play the `` is it because i am a foreigner '' card . 
  the situation has quite a few similarities with the situation of black people in the us . 
   their kids will speak it , but they wo n't . 
  often even the kids will barely speak it because many immigrant children are not going to have contact with german outside of school since their parents do n't speak german and their cousins do n't speak german and their friends do n't speak german . 
  i care about my bunker . 
  i do n't care about these bunkers . 
  by telling your isp that you like porn . 
  obviously you have no knowledge of the topic at hand . 
  a vpn is not required to unblock porn here . 
   one might even argue that the 3rd reich never really went away , but merely received a paint job . 
  one might in fact argue that if one had no interest in accepting reality . 
  so ... the british have been known to be self-posessed and arrogant for a while now ? 
  well you do n't just say tsch\u00f6 . 
  you say tsch\u00f6 mit \u00f6 !, 
  acceptable alternatives : tsch\u00fcss , tsch\u00f6 , bis dann . 
  personally i wo n't hold that against you because i have yet to meet a malicious bosnian . 
  you people are so goddamn nice that it 's almost annoying . 
  name one good alternative . 
  nono ... it 's very important to hit the us with a stick . 
  because they deserve it . 
  and you can just turn it into fustercluck when around younglings . 
  i get it though . 
  the most beautiful women are from kosovo so it 's not a surprise serbia wants to keep them .

  sugar alters your behavior and poses significant health risks as well . 
  especially when consumed in a liquid form . 
   `` the us is not a developing country so we do n't need to send teams of technical advisers into the field , '' one german diplomat said . 
  so sweet of him to say that . 
  slight difference : the carbs in soda are not registered as caloric intake by the body . 
  you can only eat so much rice , white bread , corn , nutella and what have you . 
  you can pretty much drink 4 liters of soda a day , and still go to bed feeling like you are starving . 
  so kids should be able to buy cigarettes as well ? 
   the munich court where the trial is due to start on april 17 had allocated 50 seats to all media on a first-come-first-served basis , but , in the event , none went to turkish journalists . 
   turkish newspaper sabah filed a complaint with the constitutional court in karlsruhe , saying that the munich court 's decision not to guarantee seats to turkish media had violated its right to equality . 
  seriously ? 
  cry . 
  more . 
  bitches . 
  first come . 
  first serve . 
  no there was no violation of your right to equality . 
  you were slow . 
  fuck you . 
  you do n't get special treatment because you are from turkey . 
  fuck you . 
  yes this thing has annoyed me for a while . 
  they are fucking idiots . 
  chill ... they are just doing [ exactly what their prime minister tells them to do ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/28/turkish-pm-addresses-immigrants-germany ) . 
  you can hardly blame them for that . 
  power move by merkel . 
  surprised that cameron took the invitation . 
  true . 
  but their behavior does n't help at all . 
  in my eyes every israeli is still part of an invading force and any attacks against israeli civilian or military targets are legitimate uses of defensive force . 
  they could have tried to compromise with their neighbors but they have n't and they will not . 
  the only possible outcomes with the current political climate in israel are surrender/destruction of either israel or palestine and if i personally had to decide which one had to be destroyed i would choose israel . 
  i do n't buy the `` the only ally of western democracy in the middle east '' rhetoric and i certainly do n't give a fuck about how germany `` owes '' israel . 
  if germany actually wanted to be a role model they would cut all diplomatic ties with israel until israel stops behaving like they are king shit and have the right to institute discriminatory policies and wage war against civilians and rebels alike . 
  seriously . 
  fuck israel and everyone who supports it . 
  most countries do n't piss off their neighbors enough to need such a system . 
  i like to think of our former colonies such as poland , france , austria , the netherlands and what have you as sovereign nations these days . 
  i am not outraged . 
  faux or otherwise . 
  i just think it 's silly that he ca n't see how he connected the two organizations by posting that picture along with that comment . 
  explicitly ? 
  no , but you certainly implied it . 
  and that 's an accurate comparison . 
  the eu is literally hitler . 
  in exchange for eu membership ? 
  which long run ? 
  it did n't work in the short run , that 's why it failed in the long run . 
  and it only failed in the short run because ** someone ** had to decide that he had to have everything at the same time and also commit war crimes to atrocious the international community had no choice but to intervene . 
  and then he chickened out on using poison gas . 
  the alcohol chart is very good , now i know never to accept a drinking challenge from any of the countries who are rated higher . 
  the french guy is not upset because a language is dominant , he 's just upset because it 's not ** his ** language that 's dominant . 
  if there was a french * hegemony * he would be more than happy with it . 
  this is a great idea . 
  brb setting up a prof review site . 
  edit : looked into it , too much effort for right now due to exams soon but i 'll definitely keep it in mind . 
  in germany people of any age who are sentenced to 24 months or less are generally sentenced to probation as well . 
  i think it 's a good system . 
  that was certainly true for the wehrpflichtige but as it stands now the bundeswehr is one of the most well trained and equipped armies . 
  not huge in size but still a force to be reckoned with . 
  we keep our eggs cooled after purchase and that 's okay because once we take them out of the fridge long enough for condensation to form they will be consumed before bacteria can breed . 
  and obviously we eat raw or semi-raw eggs . 
  nothing is more delicious than a perfect soft-boiled egg with a liquid yolk and firm white . 
  also how else are we going to make sauce hollandaise ? 
  and if you use it 2 days later it will still be fine . 
  after that you should seriously consider throwing it out though . 
  they do that because gema is the only significant verwertungsgesellschaft we have in germany .
