yeah that was hypothetically assumed, 
  if they and we wanted them in the eu , why not ? 
  i doubt that is the case though [ if they voted to become independent ] . 
  there you go , i did n't think of that it seems possible then . 
  what 's more , it 's up to the member states to decide who 's allowed to join . 
  if we wanted to , we could always make an exception , 
  maybe they could be considered european , since they were historically part of a european country , assumed the european countries had an interest in them joining . 
  ( edit : like cyprus ) the main question is if they even wanted to join though . 
  if they did , they maybe would have just stayed an overseas territory in the first place . . 
  ok i see , you meant independent states outside of europe that are part of the eu . 
  there are certainly none , only overseas territories . 
  i do n't think there was a case yet where such a territory went independent and wanted to join the eu . 
  that would probably be unlikely anyway , but not impossible i guess . 
  maybe they could refer to their european history , whereas countries like japan would rather not have a chance to join , 
  following that logic , territories inside europe do n't count either ... 
  if i 'm not mistaken , traditional music is played until 6pm and pop/schlager music thereafter . 
  whereas we do n't really know how many people would have bought other cars with lower emissions if they had n't cheated ( and * those * emissions were accurate  ), 
  panzer is a word in english used for german tanks , just like u-boat, 
  build and fund more tent cities in south europe/turkey / . . like the existing ones in turkey or saudi arabia ( crazy fact : they have empty tents for more than [ 3million ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ql8wfnt.jpg ) peps with air condition , plumbing , electricity , yet are not willing to take any refugees ) . 
  this will help a lot of people at once , no need to cross the sea , take routes through dozens of countries , be pushed around between different states causing uncontrolled immigration and resentments in the population . 
  this would probably have much broader support , resources could be used more efficiently and all european countries could share their contribution proportionally ( and maybe urge the usa etc. 
  as well ) . 
  it will also show that help is temporary for the time of the war . 
  they should be supplied with everything needed , but also encouraged to become more self sustaining over time . 
  ordinary german police do n't have tasers, 
  maybe he does n't actually care like in [ house of cards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp8_pqjdwje ), 
  i guess it depends on the person and sense for languages , but i found myself understanding quite a bit of written swedish , especially if you know some basic recurring words like \u00e4r , och , inte , jag , hon , han , i , till ... 
  there are certainly some keywords in the newspaper which are easy to guess , e.g. 
  the beatles , 
  do n't forget [ johannes heesters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johannes_heesters ) . 
  although i think there are generally lots of people from different countries that could be named . 
  i just had a parcel shipped from slovenia to germany with 24h express delivery included in the price . 
  it was really cool that you could track it online and see that it went via air freight from ljubljana to li\u00e8ge ( tnt euro hub ) , then to hanover and hamburg in less than a day . 
  quite impressive if you think about it  unfortunately even normal shipping is usually expensive . . 
  it 's become quite popular in many cities https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long_night_of_museums,

  or else !, 
  thanks, 
  they did combine it on tv , but in the text it says 34 % for `` same '' and 23 % `` more '' ( = 57 % ), 
  in another survey from ard ( 30.07.2015 ) , it was asked : `` how many refugees should germany receive ? '', 
  `` same as before or more '' - 57 % ( -16 compared to january ) `` fewer '' - 38 % ( +17 compared to january ) https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend/, 
  it kind of makes sense if you look at the [ currents ] ( http://www.ecomare.nl/typo3temp/gb/81d3afcec0.png ) in the north sea and german bight,

  have n't you seen that south park episode about the humencentipad ? 
  technically , the flag stands for all countries of europe , although it is used and associated with the eu  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe, 
  that 's wishful thinking , swamp german . 
  that 's interesting , i would have thought that coins are equally distributed everywhere according to their quantity by now . 
  it 's kind of sad that he 's only protected in russia . 
  it was n't his choice . 
  that 's the joke, 
  no points for germany and austria at all . . 
   shortest is any word with two letters . 
  ja , in , du , er , es , etc. 
  what about this one https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/o_%28interjektion%29, 
  you just press buttons that mostly look the same as on windows ... 
  well , they really did mess that up by changing the control concept completely ( which was basically a touchscreen design and not very intuitive ) , so they had to roll it back . 
  whereas i find most linux environments fairly easy to use . 
   [ rothenburg ob der tauber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rothenburg_ob_der_tauber#/media/file:rothenburg_bw_4.jpg ) is one i can instantly think of . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's what the tf2 map [ ` rottenburg ' ] ( http://www.teamfortress.com/twocities/rottenburg/ ) is based on . 
  just look at the [ tower ] ( http://www.tus-wa.com/maps/4379/thumbs1/15348.png ) , 
  you 're probably right about the market and the tuitions . 
  apart from that i would say that there is still a great difference in how companies and private sponsors are involved with endowment and and scholarship . 
  i think this [ article ] ( https://usaerklaert.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/zur-finanzierung-der-us-universitaten/ ) ( ger ) gives a good insight into the topic . 
  i would n't say that our universities are n't good , it just differs a lot from the us ( britain might be a special case ) . 
  there just is n't this huge symbiosis of university , students , companies , sponsors and endowments like in the us . 
  i would say that european universities are usually more geared to the broad public instead of focusing on few elitist and super-moneyed institutions . 
  that does n't mean they 're bad though , it just does n't induce those sophisticated tech clusters . 
  i would appreciate if we adopted some of these concepts but also have a high-quality education system for everyone which is free/affordable . 
  more like `` sick people 's house '', 
  imagine how much money all europe pays as licence fees to microsoft . 
  all municipalities , cities , governments , departments , administrations ... 
  imagine if we worked together and let some of our own developer teams create all the needed software for such administrative tasks for linux and support it afterwards . 
  then ship it for free to every department who needs it . 
  no need to buy new software from proprietary vendors , just because microsoft wants to sell something new . 
  there have been attempts to do this locally , but quite often they run into problems , because of lack of specialized software or incompatibilities in file formats ( which is mostly due to microsoft not wanting to properly support open document formats ) . 
  i am sure that if we worked much closer together transregionally , we could save ton of money and be completely independent . 
  how is it unusable ? 
  i think it 's most often easier to use than windows . 
  what might be an issue is that one or another software application is missing or that some exotic hardware does not work out of the box ( but both situations have improved vastly recently , not only due to steam on linux  ), 
  they did actually build [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwerer_gustav ), 
  i think it 's a great idea and i 'm totally in favor of it , however i do n't like it that much at its current state . 
  too much lobbying and democratic deficits . 
  i hope that pan-european thinking and integration continues , leading to improvements and better understanding and identification with european institutions . 
  have you heard about the concept of [ liquid democracy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg0_vhldz-8 ) [ [ de ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0g_vuwtouw ) ] ? 
  it looks a bit too colorful in my view , more like from an african country . 
  almost all other european countries have 2 colors at max , excluding black and white , 
  its history is much older though . 
  it originates from the [ teutonic black cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_cross_%28teutonic_order%29 ) , was used in [ several periods of time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichskriegsflagge ) as a war flag and is still in use by the [ bundeswehr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iron_cross ), 
  i read a study that was quite concerning : it states that ~ 45 % of european muslims are anti-semetic , ~ 45 % are fundamentalistic , ~ 65 % think that religious rules are more important than common law , ~ 55 % are homophobic , ~ 55 % think that the western world wants to destroy islam http://www.wzb.eu/sites/default/files/u252/s21-25_koopmans.pdf edit : there are some english papers i found [ here ] ( http://www.wzb.eu/en/press-release/islamic-fundamentalism-is-widely-spread ) : [ article ] ( http://www.wzb.eu/sites/default/files/u6/koopmans_englisch_ed.pdf ) | [ discussion paper ] ( http://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/2014/vi14-101.pdf ) | [ presentation ] ( http://www.wzb.eu/sites/default/files/u8/ruud_koopmans_religious_fundamentalism_and_out-group_hostility_among_muslims_and_christian.pdf ),
