  i guess one can not trust anything anymore . 
  like many other new technologies , there are good and bad parts . 
  it might be a little concerning in terms of privacy , because it basically means to be trackable all the time . 
  think of insurance companies for instance , who might be very interested in that data .

  i am really curious about whether something like this actually works in practice . 
  ubi sounds good in theory , but i think the only way to figure it out and understand all the effects is to just try it . 
  my assumption is that it will become necessary to some degree for highly developed and technlologically advanced societies in any case one day . 
  it is probably also a lot easier to implement in a country with a small population like finland at first . 
  we will see . 
  maybe if you consider traffic , 
  poland needs to mow its lawn, 
  [ probably more like this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/uzk9nda.png ) edit : still not quite . . remove the green stuff, 
  since its source is eurobarometer 2012 it 's eu countries only except uk , ireland and croatia ( which joined in 2013 ), 
  it 's just for those who fail three times at their driving test scnr , 
  you already got your tunnel should have extended it through france and belgium , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fehmarn_belt_fixed_link [ bridge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-idnd-rkdy ) vs [ tunnel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0xycapjfqo ) concept ( it was decided to build a tunnel ), 
  so what is it now ? 
  there is a note at the bottom though, 
  [ all together ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/eu_oct_and_omr_map_en.png ), 
  well , in germany you first have to prove that gema does n't own the rights . 
  there was an uproar when facebook bought whatsapp and many people wanted to move to telegram and threema , but it 's really hard to convince anyone when the vast majority of contacts still uses wa . 
  so we do n't have to change the time when we go on holiday, 
  we 'd probably have 28 captains or something, 
  apparently germany has the highest [ variety ] ( http://www.germany.info/vertretung/usa/en/04__w__t__g/04/03/02/feature__2.html ) of bread https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bread_in_europe, 
  we also still have `` heim '' from old high german `` heima '', 
  that 's what it 's called though https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monopoly_on_violence, 
  you do n't like [ werner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic1kvksgmde ) ? 
  * lietchenstien does n't actually sound too bad either , 
  i think it 's overestimated because there are a lot of children of migrants that are born in the country , but are still considered somewhat ` foreign ' . 
  we used to have * [ quite a few ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u-boats_of_germany ) * more though , 
   weird shit https://youtu.be/fbuludbhpfq ^ ^, 
  we have quite a [ notorious history ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.welt.de%2fwirtschaft%2fwebwelt%2farticle760726%2fdie-bwl-schwaeche-der-deutschen-erfinder.html&amp;edit-text= ) about it . .

  when looking at this timeline , one should bear in mind that total air traffic has increased a lot over the years, 
  marriage does not mean family though . 
  why should unmarried couples with children have a disadvantage compared to childless married couples ? 
  it 's not like there wo n't be any families any more or people would chose to be single just for the sake of being more profitable ( allegedly ), 
  i think the same way . 
  the state should n't prefer one specific way of life . 
  instead of privileging marriage , children should be promoted directly as they are the ones of interest for the future of the state . 
  we should turn back clocks more often , like every day, 
  perhaps it 's better to phrase it as ` not opposing the values and norms of a society ' . 
  multiculturalism is n't a problem as long as there is a controlled immigration of people that share the same values and norms, 
  [ deutschlandtrend ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend-405.html ) says it 's now down to 54 edit : i should have read the op where it says 70 % , but how come there is such a discrepancy ? 
   70 % aproving rate are you talking about her own party or something ? 
  id card is sufficient for europeans, 
  the blocking does n't even work if you have bildstatic.de blocked through noscript, 
  now , [ if only you could make a cross with that ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ghmt3fw.png ), 
  this decision was n't made by the eu , but the european court of justice . 
  in fact , the european commission was the one that initiated safe harbor ignoring the european parliament , which voted against it afaik . 
    favourite : sweden are n't you supposed to hate each other ? 
  there are certainly a lot of varieties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_germany, 
  i would n't call + / -1 or 2 in polls a trend . 
  it has been going up and down between 11 and 15 at most for a while . 
  where is iceland : s, 
  it actually sounds a lot better . 
  for example , artists can put parts of their work under another or a free license such as cc which was not possible with gema afaik . 
  does this mean gema gets money from the views of that video now ? 
  i wonder how they determine valid gema views and if the gema-vermutung is still applicable . 
  which is why i think this tabooing is a bad development when the actual meaning of the word is n't actually derogative . 
  i can see that speaking freely becomes more difficult when there is a growing minefield of words that disqualify you immediately , even when you do n't mean any harm . 
  i 'd rather like to see the words used so often that they lose their bad connotation . 
  as a side note and at the risk of making myself unpopular , i think it 's ridiculous how words like `` schlitzauge '' are perceived derrogative . 
  it refers to epicanthus medialis and is just something that stands out in europe . 
  i would n't mind being referred to as long-nose in asia or pale-face in africa . 
  no one takes him seriously, 
  do n't worry , we make a lot of jokes about the dutch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8mrcmwpuso, 
  that 's a weird looking map, 
  most people have a fritzbox though which is quite awesome, 
  i love the water , that 's even more than in hamburg . 
  no , we use leds, 
  they still enlarged the important part, 
  what 's your intention though ? 
  not sure if visiting a city for , say , its business district is really that interesting . 
  or if you want to live there , it 's going to be crazily expensive ... 
  that 's probably difficult to answer as most cities are pretty old in europe but many also have new modern buildings or districts . 
  what do you consider modern ? 
  skyscrapers like in [ moscow city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_international_business_center ) or [ la d\u00e9fense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_d%c3%a9fense ) ? 
  i may be locally biased , but the [ hafencity ] ( https://player.vimeo.com/video/157577359?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0 ) quarter in hamburg claims to be the biggest inner-city urban development and modernisation project . 
  maybe not as impressive , but certainly ` modern ' . 
  f81 is [ apparently the ship . . ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/santa_mar%c3%ada_ ( f-81 \\ ) ), 
  hm , not sure whether to invest in romania or eastern poland now . 
  looks a little bit like geneva though , does n't it ? 
  at least that 's where they got the idea with the fountain . 
  no but by islamic terrorists . 
  what about the 2011 frankfurt airport shooting, 
  there is this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_frankfurt_airport_shooting i think it 's ridiculous to assume that the threat is much different than in other european countries where attacks happened ( also with german victims ) just because germany was mostly lucky until now . 
  r/germany is for english speakers ( just like r/finland ) and r/de is not germany 's own subreddit , 
  that 's more than germany has . 
  oh wait , germany does n't even have its own subreddit ... 
  apparently he wo n't be a member of the afd parliament party and they are discussing an exclusion from the party, 
  using that as well . 
  it also has a [ desktop app ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk ) ( needs chrome though ), 
  the greens stayed though, 
   believe me , in a few years , when the refugee-crysis is over , nobody is going to vote for afd . 
  i do n't think it 'll be over so soon ... not least because the african population is going to explode in this century and there will be millions more refugees, 
   do n't use american-imported terms white rubbish then ?
