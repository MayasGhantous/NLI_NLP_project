  he does n't actually want to throw out the irish and hungarians . 
  to understand him , you must read between the lines - he basically just critizes the decisions of the respective governments . 
  lots of people do n't get it and translating does n't make it easier . 
  i heard the icelanders were quite happy with their capital 's mayor, 
  while i do n't support everything that he stands for ( as derived from his satirical viewpoints ) , i think he is a better contributor to democracy than most of the other representatives . 
  because he is the leader of the [ satirical party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_partei ) and was elected, 
  you can watch the video with interpretation here ( although it 's unfortunately missing some parts at least in english ) : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/plenary/video?intervention=1473843975401 if you ca n't play it in your browser ( quicktime , windows media wtf ? 
  ) , you can download and watch it with a video player and select your language . 
  edit : since it 's not actually that much , i made a quick translation which is more accurate ( i hope ) :  [ schulz  i give the floor to mep sonneborn  [ sonneborn  thank you ... boss  the eu has changed . 
  when i took my seat in parliament , i wanted to fight for a strong core europe with 27 satellite states . 
  this number has now decreased . 
  after the brexit and the pending exclusion of hungary , i want to promote to also show the irish to the door . 
  a government which refuses to accept tax payments of the apple company could convey the impression that this is about a europe of corporations and not of citizens . 
  therefore , i appeal to the irish government :  dear mr. president of ireland . 
  if you still believe that apple will create some jobs in ireland - forget it . 
  apple only ever had one jobs . 
  but he is dead . 
  he will not come back . 
  so please take my advice : take the money and run . 
  13b $ will buy you many , many iphones . 
  this will generate more tax income for ireland . 
  then you can buy even more iphones . 
  it 's a win-win-win situation . 
  think it over with a good bottle of whisky . 
  i have a suspicion that he did it on purpose, 
  hm , who says that a warning triangle must not consist of vegetables ? 
  afaik the law only says that it must be portable , stable on the ground , clearly visible and reflective . 
  maybe it 's just not reflective enough . 
  not sure what you understand by socialism , but you can have basic income and a market economy, 
  it does make sense , because you say ' * y * urop ' and do n't pronounce the first letter as a vowel . 
  the thing is that you 'd probably expect other allied countries to step in if your country was attacked , just like all other european countries that are too small to deal with big threats on their own . 
  not saying this is likely , but if we are dependent on each other in such a case one way or another , a european defence force could be much more efficient . 
  it would have to be purely defensive of course . 
  i agree with you that the question is stupid . 
  but i suppose that afd supporters think that migration \u2260 diversity ( unlike the others ) , because they understand migrants mostly as turks/arabs/muslims etc. 
  many of whom are already here and that more of them wo n't add more ` diversity ' . 
  i guess there are two ways of interpreting it , of course europe does n't receive gold as an entity itself , but if you see europe as the sum of all its members , it 's still a valid statement . 
  ( the same could actually be said about each country respectively ), 
  well , no other european country has won a medal in women 's beach volleyball before . 
  you 're right about that there is a difference between ghg and air pollutants . 
  concerning the impact of ghg to climate change , it should be noted that ch4 has a higher specific impact ( in terms of [ global warming potential ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_warming_potential ) ) , but co2 still has the larger overall impact ( in terms of [ radiative forcing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/radiative-forcings.svg ) ) and is the most important ghg because much higher amounts of co2 are released . 
  everyone i heard from so far ( a few non-europeans ) said that it was super interesting , especially all the history , sights , museums etc. 
  i do n't really know about living there to be fair , just heard that the city is pretty much broke and has chaotic administration . 
  but it 's probably still very appealing for young people due to the kiez culture etc , 
  i would rather say the opposite . .

  the [ last time ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/a/af/verteidigungsetat_deutschlands_1950-2003.png ) was actually during the cold war and it ended quite well with the reunification, 
  they are [ really huge ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/e126-prototyp-12-02-2008.jpg ) . 
  there are 2 [ in hamburg ] ( https://joergboethling.photoshelter.com/image/i0000y2nzdb3jbac ) as well, 
  i think these are [ e-126 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/enerconsizes_de.svg ) , so it 's 200m at the top . 
  why would they be retards ? 
  i think it could be particularly interesting for independent artists as the gema mostly benefits those that are already [ well off ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-mmqnaw7by&amp;feature=youtu.be ) . 
  c3s also lets its users have much better control over their licensing . 
  how do you know ? 
  there are quite a few artists that are not happy with gema policies , but have no other choice . 
  i think it 's likely that the * [ gema-vermutung ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhwahrng/__13c.html ) * will be changed once there is a competing collecting society ( although it might still take some time ), 
  nokia had its own really good os , meego , and an awesome phone , n9 , but they decided to throw everything they had developed overboard and start from 0 with windows phone ( when they got elop as their ceo ) . 
  in fact , they announced the discontinuation of all their previous developments while they did n't even have something new for deployment . 
  as anyone could have guessed , wp never really took off and they did n't even have a proven backup plan such as android . 
  i think they would have been much more successful , if they had targeted meego as an open source platform as an unique selling point . 
  the predecessor , n900 , and its os , maemo , were so popular that the community continued development voluntarily until recently . 
  how about no, 
  he looks like heino . 
  are the songs as boring as last time , or are there any crazy/funny songs like there used to be ?

  i was surprised at how many croatians speak german ... 
  that sounds stupid . 
  i guess we 're not supposed to leave then . 
  * and vinegar *, 
  what about eesti, 
  but it 's not a reason to ` accept ' it . 
  or else we would have to accept any risk that is smaller than some other risk by that logic . 
  are you comparing accidents and diseases with murder ? 
  this is way to nice . 
  but only half, 
  i do n't think we 'll ever run out of energy demand . 
  and btw . 
  wind energy plants are maybe designed for 30 years at most . 
  yet i say it too when speaking english, 
  this is ridiculous . 
  how is `` so wahr mir gott helfe '' even related to national socialism ? 
  it 's a standard and ( voluntary ) part of any oath for office . 
  my theory is that because reddit users predominantly are from us/uk and americans are not really familiar with eu issues , they are more likely to adopt the viewpoint of britons ( if at all ) , which is rather eu critical . 
  it 's a multinational company ( societas europaea ), 
  and germany , and uk , and spain ... 
  how come ? 
  i mean , passengers are usually concerned about cabin layout ( seat pitch etc ) which is mostly determined by the airline and not the aircraft manufacturer . 
  they just [ use german ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/b7hmokx ), 
  i 've heard that they will fill up from behind because they ca n't close their anus, 
  the opposite is true though . 
  the greater the freedom of choice , the greater the gap ( aka gender equality paradoxon ),

  i thought it was kind of ironic . 
  i always found that mind boggling as well . 
  i remember seeing a photo where they had to sit kind of sideways because there was n't enough space for their shoulders .
