  both are near worthless for society and both pay their taxes from spending the money they have . 
  how exactly do you distinguish not wanting from not being able to find work ? 
  i mean sure , your immigrant boy might be able to find a job in california , but if i can find you a family in say , cameron county , texas that simply does not find any jobs because there are none , how does that apply ? 
  if i remember correctly from when the topic last came up , after the us introduced it there was a push in other countries too . 
  in germany though it never stuck . 
  way too controversial for too little gain , so no one really tried to make it happen after the 70 ? 
  somewhere along that time . 
  no one in their right mind would deny that the us does a lot of technological advancements . 
  what we get salty over is when you try to take all the credit for something that was essentially a cooperation from all over the place . 
  for example , you listed solar panels . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_cell#history ) on solar cells : * effect first observed by a french guy * first cell built by a russian guy * first theoretical explanation by that one german guy * another important invention by a russian guy * first patent by an american * first practical application at bell labs as someone with comp-sci background i know that bell labs did * a lot * of basically futuristic work at the time . 
  but depending on who writes it that then turns into `` the us invented the solar cell '' or even `` the us gave the world the solar cell '' which makes us raise an eyebrow at the very least . 
  [ jakob maria mierscheid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jakob_maria_mierscheid ) obviously . 
  pfft , as if anyone cares what they do with their wheat stuff . 
  if we 're having this competition then with pils . 
  ca n't tell for the others , but in germany it 's regular news of the `` that happened '' variety . 
  tl ; dr ( dsg ) of that article : team macron say they got hacked , voting commission wants to investigate , then a lot of speculation and stuff we already knew . 
  oh and the russians are to blame . 
  my personal opinion : hacking attacks are really , really hard to prove . 
  even if you can prove it happened it 's next to impossible to prove who did it . 
  so whenever someone blurts out `` omg we 've been hacked '' it sounds to me like they 're just sore losers because ultimately unless they can prove anything it 's just meaningless attention whoring . 
  you do n't have to go that far . 
  the lightweight bag packaging had a small revival in ( northern - ) germany a few years ago . 
  not everyone can be as precise as no ' - as-big-as-medium-sized-jock-but-bigger-than-wee-jock-jock . 
  the joy of languages , is n't it ? 
  i fondly remember the ikea shower curtain by the name of wixen , which sounds like wanking in german . 
  actually i do n't mind soccer . 
  it 's unambiguous and in an international environment that 's a plus . 
  the problem is , you 'd have to come up with a better name for your version to make that stick since you wo n't accept handegg . 
  even more so as half of the film is used as quotes in daily life . 
  i can not answer this question without eating the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake . 
  force 1000 stems of vocab and most of the grammar into your head . 
  takes about half a year if you 're dedicated and is by far the hardest part . 
  go online and read stuff written by native speakers of the language . 
  read harry potter in that language . 
  read newspapers in that language . 
  watch tv . 
  does n't matter if you do n't understand every word , you 'll be able to make out the meaning anyway . 
  do that for 10 years . 
  get asked by others how you speak the language so well . 
  edit : also i want to second what / u/asyx said . 
  `` daily '' is the magic word . 
  15min a day is better than 2 hours once a week . 
  not helping . 
  that goes for the whole pop-science-activist scene really . 
  i understand that attention is a currency in these circles , but the man is a friggin linguist . 
  `` distinguished academic '' is not a title . 
  it 's charlatanry . 
  and that goes for his peers as well . 
  neil degrasse tyson , michio kaku , richard dawkins , bill nye - they all know about their own field surely but wo n't shut up about everything else to the point that they fuel anti-intellectualism more than they help combat it . 
  ha , i agree with you !, 
  this was the central point of the thread . 
  the american version of heritage when it comes to european countries is usually something like `` my great grandparents come from there '' to which we answer `` yeah , but that does n't make you irish '' . 
  apply that to a state . 
  being born and having grown up there is absolutely and without question something that shapes you , but do you ever encounter someone saying `` you know , my great grandfather came to maine from montana in 1913 , so i say pop instead of soda '' ? 
  my experience is limited to reddit of course , but i 've never seen this . 
  if i 've got time ? 
  stop and discuss it with them . 
  talking about your personal religion unprovoked is not something you do in germany so i 'd have to assume they want to talk about it or want to convert me . 
  which makes them fair game for me to question their beliefs . 
  going to church is not enough to assume someone is religious here . 
  at least in my home town the church is more of a social circle and i know plenty of people who only go there because they like the ritual , the music , are in the choir , or to play the organ . 
  is that anywhere a thing outside of reddit ? 
  only if you put the profiles on a network device . 
  ... now i feel old . 
  oook !, 
  way more . 
  i use `` jawohl '' regularly . 
  there is a slight military connotation if used like in english , but not a nazi connotation . 
  depending on how you use it , it can be perceived as a jab at someone bossing you around or simply mean acknowledgement or agreement . 
  example for the letter usage would be [ this track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvlgt4jdoc ) ( note that he also contracts `` jawohl '' to `` jawoll '' ) . 
  only for females of course , and it replaces the name :  junges fr\u00e4ulein , kommst du wohl her !, 
  do you use your `` jonge dame '' like that ? 
  not bad , just wrong and weird . 
  `` leibchen '' ( pronounced with / a\u026a\u032f / should actually be `` liebchen '' ( with / i : / ) , which is an inappropriately intimate * and * old way to address someone close to you . 
  a bit like `` honey '' in english , just even more out of place . 
  `` leibchen '' as written here instead means `` bodice '' . 
  instead of `` liebchen '' we would now say `` liebling '' which is just `` darling '' in english . 
  `` fraulein '' ( with / a\u028a\u032f / ) should be `` fr\u00e4ulein '' ( originally with / \u0254\u028f\u032f / but contracted to `` frollein '' is also ok ) which fell out of usage some time ago . 
  it 's the same as `` miss '' or `` mademoiselle '' in the sense of addressing an unmarried woman . 
  but since around the 1980s it 's barely used any more and instead we address all women with `` frau '' . 
  instead parents use it to call out misbehaving children . 
  the old version ? 
  we only read wagners version from 1876 . 
  i just checked and it seems most of our popular texts are rather recent . 
  the oldest of the ones i read in school was emilia galotti ( 1772 ) . 
  well based on the available information not a bad extrapolation , is n't it ? 
  and his website : http://www.collectivepsych.com/ you can tell he 's totes legit , because `` only highly corroborated evidences passes kroth 's litmus tests . '', 
  to be included in his book about ufos . 
  might he be the reincarnation of axel stoll ? 
  i can tell you that this trend is not universal in europe . 
  whatever those three countries are doing is not going on here , and that 's a good thing in my opinion . 
  not being able to drink a beer in public or having people binge themselves into a coma on their 21st birthday is not preferable to the current legislation . 
  my reaction every time these questions pop up in r/askeurope . 
  wikipedia says his town is nowadays in the netherlands but that the brabant region was under spanish habsburg rule at the time . 
  i did n't know any of this stuff . 
  you 've also got [ hieronymus bosch ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/el_jard%c3%adn_de_las_delicias%2c_de_el_bosco.jpg ) . 
  do n't forget the weirdo . 
  not an art person , but when thinking of d\u00fcrer i would have named [ feldhase ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/albrecht_d%c3%bcrer_-_hare%2c_1502_-_google_art_project.jpg ) before the other two in this thread .
