  no one cared , that was not the point . 
  the point was that the bundeswehr was by law a defence army and not allowed to be deployed for such a mission unless redeclared as defending the country . 
  a media reaction of the time was that with the same reasoning china or pakistan could declare their countries need to be defended at the rhine . 
  does this make sense to you ? 
   the point is to extract whether military intervention is a ) inherently wrong , or b ) often unwise vis a vis obtaining the outcome you desire . 
  i see that you do , but it sounds like you search for someone to take the * inherently wrong * bait just to say * a-ha !, 
  here is my list of reasons why you 're wrong * . 
  your definition of intervention is the central point of contention here . 
  just blowing stuff up and installing a new regime is not enough as we 've seen enough times by now . 
  the real work of intervention is how you stabilize the country afterwards , and the track record there is horrible . 
  if that mess is part of the evaluation and intervention is still an option , then it must be really bad indeed . 
  but it 's not part of the equation , at least not in public discussion . 
  remember that this line of responses was started with the `` we brought freedom , they should be thankful '' argument . 
  this is the point where we think that american exceptionalism is dangerous , because it enables people to actually think that this is true . 
  the public sentiment after 9/11 was vengeance . 
  they attacked us , someone has to pay . 
  for future reference , do you know [ the fog of war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcayzbmvf7k ) ? 
  i find this question fascinating . 
  you ask about legitimizing a military intervention but in the same breath absolve your hypothetical scenario of all the fallout the us gets criticized for all the time . 
  the intervention scenario you sketched up has by definition no civilian refugees . 
  no diplomatic consequences because the target is diplomatically isolated . 
  and no consequences for yourself because you ruled out that they might retaliate . 
  that 's not legitimizing . 
  whether or not an intervention is legitimate is completely irrelevant . 
  the only thing that counts nowadays is that enough countries agree that it should be done and no major country has a strong enough opinion against it ( and sometimes not even that as we 've seen ) . 
  if you want legitimation , go ask the un to draft a resolution based on chapter 7 of the un charter . 
  the real problem is when these `` legitimate '' interventions leave a region in shambles . 
  and with the hindsight of the last half century we 'd prefer to err on the non-intervening side . 
  do n't take the harsh reactions personally , you 're one of the main contributors of this sub and you know how we tick by now . 
  do n't know about you , but i can ignore scooter just fine . 
  but i also remember when hyper hyper was in the charts and that their best two songs were shitty dance covers of billy idol and the miss marple theme . 
  anything current they did that i should be aware of ? 
  electronic music , especially experimental or minimal . 
  we do n't own the genre ( uk is really great at it too ) , but you 'll get a lot of cool stuff here .

  i think realistically someone in the turkish administration would take whoever proposed that aside and say :  here now . 
  a bit of a diplomatic crisis with the eu is cool for securing right wing votes but outright attacking a fellow nato member ? 
  are you bloody nuts ? 
  you sound like some random redditor making up what-if scenarios . 
  now go back doing the politics stuff and cut down on hearts of iron 4 . 
  no , but i 've made it a habit to greet the driver when entering the bus . 
  i 'm neither scared about a war with russia nor about their propaganda . 
  i 'm more concerned about people telling me either of these is something i should be scared of , especially if those same people want more mass surveillance and less privacy in the same sentence . 
  large scale wars ceased to work 75 years ago . 
  there 's a reason the us and ussr quarrelled with each other in countries around the world instead . 
  and for whatever reason they should start a large scale war , i doubt mad is the preferred outcome . 
  hmm , tried to make a pun with it but you 'd have to get really creative . 
  like ... * hare * about that austrian tv station ? 
  yes , it 's lagom !, 
  ( [ spoiler1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orf_\\ ( broadcaster \\ ) ) [ spoiler2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagomorpha ) ) - i 'll show myself out . 
  uh oh ... english again luring other languages into dark alleys to mug them and rifle their pockets for vocabulary . 
  there 's not much to feel about it . 
  it 's garbage and the whole world knows it . 
  * you * know it . 
  your republicans succeed in derailing the discussion without even needing to bring any facts to the table . 
  i 've been to a doctor today . 
  asked for an appointment one day ahead , had to wait 15 minutes when i arrived on time . 
  and it 's derailing because it 's not about wait times . 
  it 's about having access to healthcare at all . 
  `` nun haben wir den salat '' or with spoken contractions `` nu hammer den salat '' is an expression of regret used when something went wrong . 
  the salad is meant to be something chaotic that 's not possible to get back into the original shape of its ingredients . 
  oh wow , i 've never heard about this . 
  this explains a lot . 
  currently only greek . 
  besides my native german and internet english i had french and latin in school and took a few semesters of japanese in uni . 
  the difficulty is in recognizing the stem when cross reading . 
  in other languages i learned you can have crazy forms , but the stem is recognizable most of the time . 
  in greek though there is this weird \u03ae and \u03ad prefixing for two-syllable forms . 
  so i see something like \u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd but do n't immediately see that it belongs to \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 . 
  and that 's not even talking about the irregular stuff like \u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 . 
  it throws a wrench into my habit of cross reading a sentence for the nouns and verbs to get a gist of what it 's about . 
  nothing that 's impossible of course , but even though you 've got some really long words like i mentioned above , a lot of everyday verbs are 2-syllable and so i constantly trip about it . 
  actually i found most of it pretty familiar . 
  i mean , genders , cases , inflected adjectives - we 've got all that too , and yours are mostly regular too . 
  we even do the same passive construct as \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 . 
  the two things i mentioned are really the outliers so far . 
  your past tense is horrible to learn . 
  and words like \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 are complete overkill . 
  we have neither of those . 
  we do n't have the localized news networks of the us , most of our relevant news agencies are on national level . 
  local journalists will simply copy reuters and then report for a page about the real local stuff that no one in the next city cares about . 
  as for talking heads , we have a few guys who will always chime in to repeat their opinion ( for example [ christian pfeiffer ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_pfeiffer ) and his hatred for video games or [ volker kauder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volker_kauder ) who always wants more law and order regardless of the occasion ) but nothing like the broad prevalence in the us . 
  and for my personal opinion : if it 's anything that reminiscent of the cold war it 's the new red scare you guys are putting up . 
  `` having ties to russia '' is suddenly a crime . 
  sure it looks odd , but it 's trump - what does n't look odd with him ? 
   filth ( drama , black comedy , 2013 ) based on a book by irvine welsh , the guy who also wrote trainspotting . 
  i do n't mind . 
  it 's a favourite pastime to `` correct '' the german of dialect speakers even though i know that it does n't really matter , so it 's only fair if someone else is pedantic to me . 
  for me the hard thing is to decide how much additional information you give . 
  simply saying `` x is wrong and should be y '' may not be helpful but saying `` x is wrong and should be y because of stupid kindergarten rule z '' is potentially condescending . 
  also : i have n't understood commas in english to this day and just use them as seasoning . 
  and i do n't want fries from you . 
  your heap of meat shreds looks suspiciously like gyros . 
  you sure you 're not a greek spy ? 
  simple !, 
  if you want to sustain a 100 % d\u00f6ner based diet , you have to include some vegetables do n't you ? 
  our long term goal is to make german style d\u00f6ner into field rations and meal replacement . 
  matrix had tastee wheat , we have d\u00f6ner . 
  guess who wins that competition .
