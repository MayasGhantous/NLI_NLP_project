  tough luck man , sauce and cabbage it is with a proper d\u00f6ner . 
  ( i agree though , no fries ) :p, 
  english also started in 5th class for me with next to no exposure outside of that . 
  no internet ( early 90s ) , no english telli , no speakers around . 
  my school offered french and latin as well and had a pretty nice deal for people like me : i had to take one language up to grade 12 and have that counted into the abitur , but it did n't matter which . 
  so i took french in grade 7 , latin in grade 9 , ditched french after grade 10 ( finishing with a 5 - , which is something like a solid f in the american system ) , ditched english after grade 11 ( with 1 point , also a solid f ) and ditched latin after grade 12 , with 9 points ( c ) , under the condition of the teacher that he would n't see us again the next year . 
  yes , he actually said that . 
  so , i managed to fail nearly every language course in my school curriculum and still somehow got to the point where i can type a sentence . 
  time and the internet is really all you need . 
  there was that other costly mistake a few decades earlier so we stocked up on good tales should this ever become a reddit question . 
  try perl . 
  for all its faults , it is designed by a linguist and you can get a away with a lot of different ways to express the same thing . 
  in perl6 you get out of the box grammars , hyper operators , sequence generators , junctions and other cool stuff you never knew you wanted a language to have . 
  the cost of course is that the language is in perpetual alpha . 
  german . 
  the logical precise language where you read everything like it 's written gets away with being neither of those . 
  for one we have the untranslatable words `` mal '' , `` ja '' and the likes which soften or alter the meaning of sentences . 
  `` mal '' for example turns a harsh imperative into a friendly suggestion and `` ja '' connotes that the speaker expects the listener to already know what 's being said . 
  both of these are regularly just omitted when translating to english which makes statements by our politicians usually completely insane . 
  well , not that they are n't in the original ... as for being a phonemic language , where you just pronounce like it 's written , that 's only mostly true . 
  it 's not as bad as english of course ( is any language ? 
  ) , but it conveniently glosses over the fact that german has a ton of different vowel sounds . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_greek_phonology#/media/file:standard_modern_greek_vowel_chart.svg ) is the vowel chart for modern greek . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_german_phonology#/media/file:german_monophthongs_chart.svg ) is the chart for only the monophthongs in standard german . 
  the diphthongs would require a few more charts and then there 's 3 pages of annotations for regional differences . 
  it 's obviously not possible to map that onto the available characters . 
  there are even pronunciation guides on youtube perpetuating this while pronouncing the same vowel character differently in different words . 
  i just checked whether i 'm in r/shitamericanssay or not, 
  wow , i never knew you could make ipa look texan . 
  i wonder where they got that number . 
  the spiegel link sources rki , which indeed puts the number at [ 4 % ] ( https://www.rki.de/de/content/service/presse/pressemitteilungen/2016/18_2016.html ) but your link sources ifd , and all i can find from them is the same [ 4 % ] ( http://www.ifd-allensbach.de/uploads/tx_studies/6184_gesundheitsorientierung.pdf ) in 2001 and a newer study from 2013 which only asks whether people would agree with a veggie day and has [ 3 % ] ( http://www.ifd-allensbach.de/uploads/tx_reportsndocs/pd_2013_06.pdf ) for the answer `` never '' to the question `` how often do you eat meat ? '' . 
  edit : found something similar : [ how many germans identify as vegetarians * or * mostly forgo eating meat ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/173636/umfrage/lebenseinstellung---anzahl-vegetarier/ ) - arrives at 5.29 m absolute for 2016 , which would be 6.4 % . 
  they do n't , as you would imagine . 
  i guess what counts for us is to reach the right number . 
  everything else is a bonus . 
  i always thought it was weird _ not _ to do this . 
  if you just hear '' ` allo '' or `` da ? '', 
  and do n't immediately recognize the voice you 're in that embarrassing silence of deciding if you got the wrong number or not . 
  you hear the name you 're expecting - problem solved . 
  i think everyone who even recognizes the name will have a rough idea . 
  i could have made the same joke about ithkuil , but who in the world knows that one ? 
  now i 'm tempted to do this topic for lojban . 
  a yes , it took us a week to figure out that / ` dam\u0254\u0303 ` nila ` ga\u0272e / should mean '' [ damon hill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/damon_hill ) has won '' . 
  apart from subjonctif ? 
  this might sound weird coming from a german ( since our phonology is an even worse clusterfuck ) but i have most trouble pronouncing the staccato of guttural sounds . 
  a lot of words like * \u00eatre * or * regarde * when spoken at sufficient speed feel like your tongue is slapping back into your throat at supersonic speeds and you are in danger of choking yourself to death at any time . 
  if it 's isolated , no problem . 
  but throw a couple of them together with / s / and / z / and it becomes a nightmare . 
  `` something something something '' ... and i 'm out . 
  yes we use it , but it 's dying nevertheless . 
  possessive is a last bastion , but genitive triggering prepositions ( au\u00dferhalb , statt , trotz , wegen ) are somewhere between 50/50 and dead as a doornail . 
  that 's roughly the standard theory according to reddit , yes , but i think it 's backwards . 
   and nobody is really american by virtue of having always been here , except for native americans quite on the contrary . 
  so the settlers brought small pox and it wiped out 90 % of the indians . 
  no hard feelings about that , well at least not from us . 
  but the deep cultural refusal to accept that living in a country for 400 years makes you by definition the people of that country is unnerving to say the least . 
  australians somehow do n't have that remorse . 
  the thing is we not only do n't remember large immigration periods ( at least meaning replacement of a large percentage of the population in short time , the other kind is going on here all the time ) , even if there had been , it pales before more recent events . 
  nations and territories fluctuated too fast over here . 
  my own grandmother would have been counted as three different nationalities depending on when your map of the region was drawn . 
  go a few generations back and if even one of your ancestors travelled outside of the village , you can claim a dozen nationalities . 
  there 's just no value in that . 
  you simply identify with the nation you grew up in and that 's that . 
  ( * ) americans on the other hand do n't have anything else than being american a thousand miles in every direction and all the way back until their family immigrated . 
  you have so much space that is all implicitly american . 
  you do n't claim utah heritage because that 's not a heritage , that 's american . 
  you 've absorbed the standard of being american so well that you forgot it exists . 
  now the internet is here and you meet people for whom this standard does n't apply . 
  it 's not the immigrant culture . 
  it 's the lack of distinction from other cultures because there 's only the one . 
  edit : ( * ) this point does n't apply to all nations , but they 've still a lot of reasons ( wars ) to not be someone else . 
  ha , our teachers made a point of using weaponized sie from grade 11 on . 
  since 11-13 are optional , they made it quite clear : we expect you little shits to act like grown ups now , and if you do n't like it you can always quit . 
  that username calling for an echo chamber ? 
  the difference is that they do n't do jack all with the original culture . 
  cultural appropriation treats culture as intellectual property , and treats some chap wearing feathers as a violation of ip rights of indians . 
  we do n't see it this way , we do n't mind if some bloke in texas likes bratwurst and lederhosen . 
  on the contrary , that 's great . 
  what we care about is that our culture is not the disney version they came up with , and we get pissed when they confuse ancestry with some magic attribute . 
  actually a lot of germans who were forced to read it in school will tell you exactly that . 
  i can to this day not understand what qualities elevate the writings of g\u00fcnter grass above other literature . 
  curse of monkey island would like to have a word with you . 
  but yeah , usually the voice acting in games is atrocious and bland . 
  both are not really political issues in germany . 
  we do n't have gay marriage but we have a legal civil union that is almost equal . 
  the only discussion is about the `` almost '' , i.e. 
  over adoption rights and pension entitlement for the widowed partner . 
  since merkels party still caters to the catholic voters they wo n't really try to change that . 
  same thing with drugs . 
  we do n't have a war on drugs , and not enough pressure for legalising it that it would be a serious political discussion . 
  if someone brought it up , she 'd most likely keep quiet about her personal opinion and use it as a bargaining chip with her coalition partners to get other things done she cares more about . 
  is it common for you to just type greek in latin ? 
  i 've only learned the words in greek and reading them like this makes my head spin . 
  dear austrian : do n't worry , we 've learned not to back you up when you have a quarrel with serbia . 
  other than that , relax . 
  the world is not ending , the refugee stream is already drying up , and if the current trend continues you 'll keep below your 37500 even if you process all the applications . 
   are you serious ? 
  he 's not alone with that opinion . 
  it was a statement when the only other accepted solution was `` hope they drown in the mediterranean when we do n't see it '' . 
  the floodgates were open well before that .
