  the sei is reported speech here , not a possibility . 
  * `` it 's been until after 1990 that we started to seriously consider the fact that there 's something outside of the western world '' - with connotation that he expects the reader to agree . 
  * `` the middle east has kept africa out of our hairs '' . 
  - the hairs idiom is `` vom hals halten '' in german , and passive/active works better . 
  * `` one thing is clear about the future '' - ready does n't really work here . 
  * `` we * will have to * invest more in iraq ... and then we * will have to * play more ... '' - big difference between should and will have to . 
  * `` sch\u00e4uble further * dismisses * one of the proposals , '' - wording is pretty clear from the get-go that he does n't want this . 
  again worded with the connotation that the reader agrees with him . 
  * `` sch\u00e4uble * is * worried ... '' - again konjunktiv is reported speech here . 
  * `` the rich countries should * turn towards * the disadvantaged regions . '', 
  - he does n't say compensate or even help . 
  clinically sterile political wording . 
  * `` the task of the globalised world will be to create * a revolution of moderation * , a fundamental * change towards no exaggeration * '' - what he said is hard to parse and can be read in both your and my interpretation , but from context i think this one is what he meant . 
  * `` he was * humored * '' - `` bel\u00e4chelt '' is way less harsh than laughed at . 
  bemused would also fit . 
  * `` it rubs some of them the wrong way when i say this '' - connotation here is , that yes , they have other opinion , but it also slightly pisses them off . 
  * sch\u00e4uble * is * worried about the condition of the american democracy . 
  - again , reported speech . 
  * sch\u00e4uble is worried about the condition of american democracy , which '' * in the eyes * of a non-western person [ ... ] is becoming * more of a plutocracy of big capital than a democracy * '' . 
  * '' * even * the americans will have to learn to look at the world from a different perspective and not only from their own . 
  for example , * why have n't they still properly succeeded in being a good partner for latin america * ? 
  the presserat in germany is not state-driven , so no , not censorship . 
  i do n't know how it 's handled in different countries , the english term would be [ ethics and standards in jounalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/journalism_ethics_and_standards ) i think . 
  and of course i only dislike what i do n't agree with . 
  that 's the whole problem !, 
  if a politician spews bullshit that i 'm inclined to believe because it confirms by biases then i need a press that is willing to call it out . 
  and not only from the opposing side , also from the media that gained my trust . 
  hmm , if you put it this way ... good point . 
  do n't get me wrong , i would n't want the rabid us press either . 
  every time i see the word `` debunked '' i mentally make a note to avoid that source in the future . 
  also i realize that being a politician means that whatever you say gets dissected in public , so you will screw up something sooner or later . 
  there has to be a middle ground somewhere , but wherever it is , it 's not where we are now . 
  wikipedia tells me that you poles have something similar to our pressekodex , the etyka dziennikarska ? 
  based on the dates most likely a template for ours . 
  how does that work out for you ? 
  the entity guarding ours will mostly send stern letters without consequences , and the worst offenders ( bild ) will generally just ignore them . 
   who is to blame here are almost exclusively politicians . 
  i blame the media almost exclusively for this . 
  they let themselves be a platform for politicians to talk shit on without any restriction or accountability . 
  the instance someone pulls numbers out of his ass , the media should collectively go * citation needed * - mode . 
  they did not , and miraculously the majority of promises turn out to be bullshit . 
  it 's become far too easy to just make up stories , and watch people agree that you confirmed their biases . 
  we 've got the same problem here in germany . 
  politicians of all parties flat out lie into a camera and no-one bats an eye , because this has been going on for decades . 
  ( and for the record , i 'm not with the afd crazies , i mean lies of historic proportions like `` die rente is sicher '' or `` niemand hat vor eine mauer zu bauen '' ), 
  do n't forget we 'd get to keep munich . 
  or are you implying those are bavarian with their spd votes ? 
  of course i am . 
  and this is the banter i 've had with friends and relatives from britain in the same vein it 's used lightheartedly around reddit all the time . 
  but i think it gets very problematic when newspapers and television are falling into this too . 
  and this is exactly that for the reasons i wrote . 
  i do n't mind being called kraut or mof or whatever here on reddit , but i expect better reasoning from the guardian or the bbc . 
  indeed he does . 
  i 'm complaining about the fact that whatever his intentions are , he still ca n't write two sentences about germany without pulling the nazi card , whether good or bad . 
  it 's hard to convey how immensely tiring this is . 
  do n't take it personally , but britons are by far the worst when it comes to this . 
  every conversation about anything german looks like this : * what do you think of angela merkel ? 
  - well , she 's not hitler . 
  * what do you think of the volkswagen scandal ? 
  - well the nazis build volkswagen . 
  * did you hear about that hurricane in hamburg the other day ? 
  - that was a blitz was n't it ? 
  * what do you think about that refugee deal with turkey ? 
  - well something , something hitler !, 
  it 's like your mind is constantly repeating this [ dylan moran scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioliu2ni66w&amp;t=1m06s ) ( hilarious btw . ) . 
  and deflecting that to some other war another century down the line does n't make it better . 
  we 're discussion economy of now . 
  refugees now . 
  borders and policies of 2016 . 
  why does he think a leading germany is not a good thing ? 
  he does n't say . 
  i 'm sure he has arguments he could bring forth when pressed , but instead he appeals to some nebulous common sense about the wars . 
  and this pisses me off , because this is no way to form an informed opinion . 
  so however you vote on brexit , please do it for better reasons than which war in the last 300 years you liked best . 
   that has to be a bad idea -- as sensible germans will attest . 
  sensible germans _ might _ agree , had he not immediately followed up with 1914 and 1939 . 
  as it stand he sounds like just another inselaffe regurgitating the same old stereotypes . 
  if his understanding of europe boils down to germans = hitler then he should not write about it . 
  drunk _ and _ southerner . 
  otherwise the conversation would of course be entire held in `` naaa ? 
  i 'm not sure what i said to deserve this comment . 
  i 'm just observing that i 've met a lot of people who do n't like wischmeyer . 
  i think he 's hilarious . 
  it should be noted that this was a half updated skit he did years ago and not just with brits but with half of europe , and even that was mild compared to what he did when he was doing radio back in the 90s . 
  one of his regular programs was called `` das land der bekloppten und bescheuerten '' , which is best put as `` the land of the batshits and brainfarts '' - of course referring to germany . 
  he 's not exactly popular with a lot of folks here either . 
  also his style does n't translate well . 
  to elaborate : he comes from lower saxony . 
  it 's the 2nd largest state in germany , and yet most foreigners would be hard pressed to name even one city from there and they know it . 
  so he usually rides on the stereotype that lower saxons are all stupid farmers who only know about pigs , shit , and exporting politicians while also packing all that into distinguished speech far removed from his piss jokes . 
  the english subtitles in that video are indeed stupid . 
  if i had to compare his style i think al murray or dylan moran would be similar , especially the latter . 
   thank ~ ~ god ~ ~ fsm user name does not check out . 
  mentally unstable username checks out . 
  in a proper landscape you can see who 's visiting next tuesday !, 
  it 's pretty solid , but it does n't really compare to doctor who , torchwood , sherlock and adam curtis . 
  and then you 've got all those things we ripped off over the years like the office or till death us do part . 
  nitpick for the casual reader who might not be familiar with this period : no you can not see the berlin wall on this map . 
  the border between blue and red could be called the iron curtain , but berlin is located about 150km inside the blue area , and the berlin wall separated the western part of the city from the eastern part . 
  so the map actually should contain a red spot in the shape of west berlin .
