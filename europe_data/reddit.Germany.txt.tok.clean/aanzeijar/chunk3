   russia is agressive and warmongering but you happily work with them . 
  you do n't ? 
  well , more for us then . 
   we can see drama in us about possible collusion of trump 's people with russia the difference being that russia is not some bogeyman here . 
  all you need to do in the us is point to someone and accuse them of russia connections to stir up shit . 
  it does n't work like this for germany . 
  and while schr\u00f6der 's immediate employment on north stream after his chancellorship was seen a bit inappropriate , i 've never heard suspicions about him acting against state interests . 
  on the contrary . 
  when he was chancellor everyone knew that access to energy would be a major goal for any state in the 21st century , and conveniently the us had just sported their adventures in the middle east `` securing '' oil . 
  one could argue that he secures gas from russia for germany . 
  now i have to guess what the dutch word for that is . 
  based on swearing in and einschw\u00f6ren ... inswern ? 
  we have a [ desert ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/lieberoser+w%c3%bcste+ ( lieberose + desert ) / @ 51.9407339,14.354785,3442 m/data = ! 3m1 ! 1e3 ! 4m5 ! 3m4 ! 1s0x4707dd8f33eb0d09 :0 xa036af8a6ea9b6f ! 8m2 ! 3d51 .9399791 ! 4d14 .3562126 ), 
  i do see the occasional jogger , but not that many . 
  i personally hate running . 
  even during my military time i 've done 3km tops and ducked out of doing all the longer ones . 
  i do n't think i 'd last even 1km nowadays . 
  i can ( and regularly do if the weather is nice ) walk several km . 
  no need to hurry . 
  [ physics check out !, 
  when i first moved out from my parents i considered my electric kettle the most important household item . 
  for everything that uses about a litre of hot water its faster and cheaper than both a microwave and a stove . 
  no , i do n't think you will find someone like that , unless you redefine being potus as bringing dystopian fiction to real life . 
  your freedom military boner does n't work abroad . 
  3 : first of all : the leader of north korea is kim jong-un , kim jong-il passed away 6 years ago . 
  so yes , you ca n't negotiate with him . 
  other than that , nk is not a threat to the us . 
  they are a threat to south korea . 
  no one thinks he `` wo n't stop until the states are destroyed '' . 
  because that would be rather short adventure . 
  4 : technically illegal here , but few care . 
  personal consumption is mostly ignored by the police . 
  we do pride ourselves on being eco friendly , but hemp never really got off . 
  instead we just recycle . 
  5 : most likely a nice place to live , but i would n't want to . 
  i like my 25 vacation days that are not used for sickness , and i do n't think having a few thousand more disposable income is worth the hassle . 
  about your shit : you 've got it together in some areas , in other its so far spread that scientists will have to trace the original fan back to the big bang . 
  as a whole you have a knack for encouraging people to risk their neck to be the first to make money of something . 
  the downside is that not everyone can be first , and your society ruthlessly drops anyone who is n't . 
  worth looking up to ? 
  is this really that important to your self esteem ? 
  because if it is , you 're in for a surprise . 
  6 : alien life exists by pure statistical argument . 
  i do n't think they have been here . 
  that pesky universal speed limit seems to get in the way quite firmly and travelling a few million years just to say hello to apes does n't seem like a good investment . 
  opened it and secretly hoped adam curtis would start talking . 
  * roughly ... `` moderate your language barky bollocks mug , otherwise i will have to insult you . '', 
  back then they did real 1h long trailers . 
  the abstract question why the government agency is allowed to do violence _ at all _ in response to criminal acts if it forbids exactly this violence in the first place is already interesting enough . 
  have you ever wondered about the fundamental justification for imprisonment for example ? 
  for fines ? 
  for felonies ? 
  from our perspective we do n't need a reason to be against death penalty , you need a shitload of good reasons to be * for * the death penalty . 
   if it can be proved without a doubt that someone killed someone in cold blood and can not be rehabilitated , is n't wrong not to kill them ? 
  okay , what is your reason for it ? 
  why should this guy be dead ? 
  this is not an easy question . 
   it is not justice , but necessity . 
  this is exactly the point . 
  the death * penalty * is a tool of the justice system . 
  if it 's not justice , it does n't belong there . 
  if you argue for a death to defend society , that is called euthanasia . 
  counter question : you know hamburg , but do you know the [ l\u00fcneburger heide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%bcneburg_heath ) directly south of it ? 
  that 's one of the places where you wo n't find many tourists . 
  you explanation is not complete without the [ axel stoll klangbrett ] ( https://sicherheit.reichsinter.net/ ), 
  how are the dynamics between officers and sergeants in the wild ? 
  when i did my 10 months , we had a lot of bickering between sergeants , officer cadets and reserve officer cadets . 
  no one took it seriously of course , but you know - military people have different standards for what counts as serious . 
  on one occasion the captain asked his ( young and overweight ) lieutenant `` how did you fare at the last pft ? '', 
  and dropped a training hand grenade at his feet . 
  meanwhile pissing off a * staff * sergeant would result in swift retribution even for ostensibly higher ranked lieutenants . 
  is this normal ? 
  mostly heavier to carry though . 
  the artificial lake in hannover for example was a giant work creation scheme . 
  the bed was already a bit lower than the surroundings and would be regularly flooded by the nearby river . 
  so having an artificial lake as flood protection had been a viable idea back in the 19th century . 
  but when the unemployment rate rose in the 30s the nazis more or less told people to bring a shovel and start digging . 
  you mean flinten-uschi ? 
  it 's a lot easier to glorify your unification war when it 's 2200 years ago instead of 70 years . 
  not without some youtube links . 
  gallons are right there with those other fantasy units from terry pratchett . 
  remember the footnote from good omens ? 
   note for young people and americans : one shilling = five pee . 
  it helps to understand the antique finances of the wichfinder army if you know the original british monetary system :  two farthings = one ha ` penny . 
  two ha ` pennies = one penny . 
  three pennies = a thrupenny bit . 
  two thrupences = a sixpence . 
  two sixpences = one shilling , or bob . 
  one florin and one sixpence = half a crown . 
  four half crowns = ten bob note . 
  two ten bob notes = one pound ( or 240 pennies ) . 
  one pound and one shilling = one guinea . 
   the british resisted decimalized currency for a long time because they thought it was too complicated . 
  see , this is what i meant . 
  if your reason is not to help brutal authoritarian regimes , then cut any trade with the saudis right now . 
  this is n't about the cuban population and never was . 
  the un even criticized the embargo [ every friggin year from 1992 on ] ( https://undocs.org/a/res/47/19 ) . 
  in the last years near unanimous . 
  on the other hand , what has it accomplished ? 
  did the castro regime crumble ?
