  i 've watched crash course world history . 
  is n't that enough ? 
  / s seriously though , i 've long given up on knowing all about history . 
  there 's just too much of it , and it 's not my special interest . 
  bill bryson 's short history of nearly everything was already chock full of names and dates , and that was only scientific history and mostly eurocentric . 
  i shudder at the thought of someone coming up to me on the street and asking `` yo !, 
  here 's a questionnaire about ancient china . 
  not qin dynasty , that would be too easy . 
  400 years before that !, 
  i hope you know your history ! '', 
  - total blank there . 
  poor americans . 
  that one is going to haunt them forever . 
  edit : if anyone does n't know the reference : it refers to [ this ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/3dpuxy/visiting_your_beautiful_country_this_weekend_want/ ) post from ages ago . 
  they do n't even know th\u00fcringer mett in the south . 
  can you imagine that ? 
  it is the jared leto film . 
  das boot as a macho remake . 
  now that is a thought . 
  elias m'barek as der alte . 
  jan b\u00f6hmermann as 2wo . 
  do you think we can get giorgio marauder to do a funky soundtrack like for metropolis ? 
  it 's a shame that one is so little known . 
  if the question would have been most influential - metropolis any time of the day . 
  but without that ? 
  both are at the pinnacle of film making . 
  an edgar wright film , an irvine welsh adaptation and a guy ritchie film you mean . 
  you can interchange all of these with other works , and still come out with a worthy line-up . 
  das boot is a close runner up though . 
  there 's not much opposite spectrum in german politics . 
  it 's either centrist/compromise or special interest groups , but i would n't call that opposite . 
  but even those centrists can have absolute crackpot ideas . 
  for example , our cdu ( merkels party ) had for some time now the grand idea that data minimization ( the principle of only saving data you absolutely need and nothing more , because then you ca n't lose that data ) is outdated and in the way of the economy . 
  so - and i 'm not making this up - every enterprise should save as much data as they can get their hands on and be free to sell that however they like . 
  needless to say , everyone even remotely interested in informational self-determination got a heart attack on hearing that . 
  * edit * oh dear , the title said * agree * . 
  i read disagree . 
  never mind . 
  never heard of it , but like others i do n't listen to radio , so i have no idea what 's popular . 
  eh , you 'll have that problem with any system . 
  having voting rights by accidentally being born on a transit flight is just a bonkers . 
  oh and btw . 
  : in germany you must have lived for 3 months in the country at age 14 or above in the last 25 years to have voting rights .

   baseballcaps especially indoors . 
  call me old fashioned , but i got taught to take of my headgear when stepping under a roof . 
  it 's not entirely wrong . 
  before that time advertising targeted `` need '' . 
  you needed shoes , toothpaste and detergent , so advertising promised that they would do the job . 
  around the great depression it was deemed that creating demand by appealing to `` want '' instead of `` need '' was a way to stabilize the economy . 
  quote from a lehman brothers banker of 1927 :  we must shift america from a needs - to a desires-culture . 
  people must be trained to desire , to want new things , even before the old have been entirely consumed . 
  [ ... ] man 's desires must overshadow his needs . 
  at least that 's what [ the century of the self ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_century_of_the_self ) taught me . 
  new conspiracy theory !, 
  global warming is caused by the inverter unit . 
  we need to ban those parts of the ac . 
  now i 'm curious . 
  if you pump 3kw of energy into this thing , how does it make things cooler instead of hotter ? 
  define heat wave . 
  here that would be everything warmer than 25 \u00b0 . 
  does trump even know what the un is ? 
  you never know with hat guy . 
  neither have i. 
  it 's called tantal in german as well , like in swedish . 
  since we 're tasked with providing eu anthems , the new one shall be [ nicole - ein bisschen frieden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnjahffo7ei ) . 
  the # 1 restriction is stupid , you obviously should get [ opus - live is life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egikhmjtszi ) . 
  is that a sneaky setup for a discussion about aluminium ? 
  i thought that was * `` you , you and you !, 
  fuck off , we 're having tiffanies . 
  while the etymology makes sense if you know it , modern german speakers would never guess that this word refers to a place in the first place . 
  it sounds like a dish ( gericht ) involving lentils ( linsen ) . 
  i needed a character name in world of warcraft , mashed a bit on the keyboard and filled in a few vowels . 
  it stuck . 
  darjeeling , earl grey , and that nameless fruit tea from my local discounter that penetrates the whole building with its scent . 
  my cat gets [ this ] ( https://www.bad-heilbrunner.de/de/intens-tee/schlaf-und-nerven-tee/ ) one . 
  contains valerian , sends cat into rave mode . 
  back in the early internet days ? 
  of course not , you just made something cool and it got bigger , usually because people you knew used it and spread the word . 
  you 'll find even lots of software from that time written in the local language . 
  i had to debug software written in french back in uni . 
  was a nightmare . 
  localizing software is n't that large of a deal ( though there are still lots of pitfalls ) , but as soon as you create actual content , doing it in more than one language is going to be bloody expensive and going full multi-lang from the get go is out of question . 
  but there 's another problem why it would n't take off even if it was written with that in mind : anglophones are sadly pretty isolated in their consuming habits . 
  you just do n't hang around in the norwegian internet the same way that norwegian kids hang around in the english internet ( that may sound ridiculous , but substitute norwegian with german , french , spanish and it 's not that small any more ) . 
  so if anything takes off , it 's most likely the domestic stuff that also reaches all other westeners with english as a second language . 
  the software i work on is in german and english for exactly the reason you describe . 
  as far as i know there 's only one non-german version in production ... and that is a custom built version in chinese for a firm with a subsidiary there . 
  that 's just how it is . 
  * shrug *, 
  should mention that `` alter '' has nothing to do with the literal translation `` age '' . 
  it 's a short form of `` alter schwede '' which goes back to the thirty years war when swedish veterans were hired as drill sergeants , and `` the old swede '' became an euphemism for badass . 
  youth language like it 's 1648 yo !, 
  too soon . 
  source ? 
  i could n't find anything of infratest dimap for this question and whatever i search the results get polluted with answers for the question of which professions are * trusted * the most . 
  clicked the ronja link , expected the mattis chant , was not disappointed . 
  a great piece of my childhood . 
  yeah , pretty much the same . 
  i work in written english half of the day , but each time i actually have to _ speak _ it the sounds that come out are n't what i want them to be , i 'm struggling to put sentences in order fast enough , and it 's exhausting as hell .
