  how do you get 99 % out of two people ? 
  i think it says more about your culture that you still commemorate that date from three quarters of a century ago . 
  i just looked around and i can find exactly 2 articles in german about it . 
  one is focus.de ( huff post style content mill ) , the other is bloomberg-voices . de . 
  too bellicose . 
  the political climate in germany does not take well to ego personalities like him . 
  his talking points are also already taken by all major parties . 
  politicians wanting to regulate the internet . 
  a success story . 
  * sigh * what do you mean you can not implement key escrow and still have the algorithm be safe ? 
  you 're technical geniuses , make it happen !, 
  do n't get too hung up on that distinct language thing . 
  it 's classified as different from high german because of the consonant shifts , but it 's not that far away . 
  certain low german dialects are easier to understand for a northern german than casual bavarian . 
  and a [ low german ] ( https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:h%c3%b6%c3%b6ftsiet ) version . 
  [ hey , it 's not my idea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gridiron_football ) . 
  as i 've said before , i have no problem at all with `` soccer '' in an international context . 
  its unambiguous and that is a good thing . 
  now if you also stop calling handegg `` football '' and use `` gridiron '' instead we can bury the whole confusion . 
  ranting about it obviously , this is the internet after all . 
  still , my personal approach would be : forget about the person . 
  look for the incentives that drive what you do n't like about it . 
  the person is almost always a symptom , not the problem . 
  hitler was an asshole ^ ( citation needed ) , but the won an election because of deeper issues . 
  and the allies thought so too when they did n't repeat the treaty of versailles after the war . 
  if you think a drug overlord is bad , the problem is most likely that the economy of the region is dependant on those drugs and monopolizing them with violence and bribes is a winning strategy . 
  so if you get rid of the drug overlord , the next one pops up . 
  understanding the problem does n't mean there 's an easy solution ( that would be nice ) , but at least you do n't go around blaring `` crooked hillary '' or `` putin influence '' or similar inane crap . 
  this question . 
  it embodies something i really hate . 
  the `` villain '' is a concept of stories and has no place in the living world . 
  even trying to make it work means breaking your brain sideways . 
  and what for ? 
  it provides a simple excuse for not having to understand why the world is how it is . 
  it enables shit like invading a country on a lie because some guy is supposed to be a villain and needs to be put down . 
  no thanks . 
  zero . 
  i think you vastly overestimate the rate of imprisoned jihadists and their modus operandi . 
  the scary terrorist attacks are almost always the first big act of the individual , and well ... you do n't need capital punishment to keep a * suicide * attacker from trying again . 
  they are much more likely to try to radicalise new ones than break the others out of prison , especially since italy seems to have a problem with radicalising in prison based in [ this ] ( https://www.ict.org.il/ictfiles/0/report_on_islamic_community_in_italy.pdf ) report . 
  from what i 've seen from you in the rest of the thread , i 'd suggest you to ask a law theoretician . 
  the disconnect between what lay persons ( me included ) think what institutional violence is for differs a lot from the accumulated corpus of ideas . 
  it is a fascinating topic , and at least for the german traditions what you wrote is simply wrong . 
  i 'm pretty sure there must be sources in italian for italy as well . 
  a valid question , and although i 'm not a law expert , i 'll try to summarize : first of all , although i quoted article 1 for the added gravitas , article 2 additionally holds : * every person shall have the right to life and physical integrity . 
  freedom of the person shall be inviolable . 
  these rights may be interfered with only pursuant to a law . 
  * and because you could still argue that pursuing the law is exactly the question here , there 's also article 102 , which in it 's entirety reads : * capital punishment is abolished . 
  * so that 's the law side , and article 102 is intentionally not included in the * ewigkeitsklausel * , the set of articles that can never be changed . 
  still , the stance that article 1 already prohibits it was expanded on in [ a ruling of our constitutional court in 1995 ] ( http://lexetius.com/1995,464 ) ( verse 29 , translation by me ) :  for humanitarian reasons there can be no right for the any state to decree by these sanctions over the life of it 's citizens . 
  rather commands the primacy of absolute protection of life that the jurisdiction substantiates the inviolability of human life as supreme value precisely by forgoing capital punishment . 
  additionally it seems immediately necessary to guard a priori against the danger of abuse of capital punishment by assuming their unanimously given prohibition . 
  misjudgements can never be ruled out . 
  the federal organization of carrying out death penalties is ultimately , as measured by the ideal of the human dignity , a by all means unacceptable and insupportable endeavour . 
   these concerns suggest the result that according to the german constitutional law every reintroduction of the death penalty , even disregarding article 102 , can have no substance in the presence of article 1 and the essential content guarantee for the basic right of life in article 2 . 
  and since the cast majority of germans agree with this stance , this is how it is . 
  article 1 of the german basic law : human dignity shall be inviolable . 
  to respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority . 
  it is deemed that capital punishment is not compatible with this article . 
  to change that would mean to literally give up who we are . 
  our climate is stabilized by the water masses around us . 
  it 's not only that the northern us get colder despite being further south , they also get warmer in summer . 
  average high in june is 29 \u00b0 c/84 \u00b0 f in nebraska , 22 \u00b0 c/72 \u00b0 f in berlin . 
  moral : always have an ocean nearby , preferably more than one . 
  i may surprise you that people need to pee even when not drunk . 
  alcohol , drugs and violence . 
  i mean , we all know it 's not like that in the real world , but sometimes i 'm astonished at the social norms that hollywood has built for itself . 
  two characters arguing ? 
  one of them is likely to flip his shit and start getting physical . 
  lone character in a quite scene ? 
  very likely to involve a glass of whiskey to show how badass they are . 
  have two teens in a film and at least one of them is black ? 
  one of them is going to have a small plastic bag with drugs at some time as if this is a cosmic constant . 
  i 'm not watching a lot of films these days , but when we actively went to sneak peeks every week i noticed that it 's far more wide spread than the usual marvel/action films that are marketed to me . 
  it 's so widespread that [ wild ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_\\ ( 2014_film \\ ) ) actually subverts it by having reese witherspoon fear for her life when she meets strangers , only for them to be nice and friendly for a change - drugs are still in it though ( and i was actually surprised how much i liked the film ) . 
  it 's regular-strength ~ ~ tylenol ~ ~ till schweiger !, 
  here 's what ` cha do : get her to open her mouth , take a handful , and throw it at her . 
  whatever sticks , that 's the correct dosage . 
   what kind of english do you speak  lists dozens of peculiarities from the us do you want to get linked to sas ? 
  edit : took the test , large red spots in tennessee and california , most blue around minnesota and dakota . 
  that 's with  50 % other and `` do n't have a word for that '', 
  depends on what you call person of colour i think . 
  technically gengis khan invaded the fringes of eastern europe . 
  and the moors conquered regions in southern europe in the 8th century . 
  how do you do that with icelandic names where the patronym/matronym is frequently dropped ? 
  ^ ( have fun typing the latter ), 
  i consider the entire english part of the internet american dominated . 
  the good thing about that is that we 've got our corners of the internet to ourselves because burgers do n't usually learn german . 
  joke 's on us though , because every good business idea will be ignored ( even if it 's in english ) until an american company does the same . 
  then it 's hot sauce . 
   it might be cheaper [ yeah , about that ... ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134657 ), 
  watch out for the small print . 
  they like to declare dental stuff non-essential . 
  oh and outlaw homoeopathy while you still can , we 're sadly stuck with it . 
  by which you mean that no german would ever try to pronounce austrian . 
  this will be the best day of your life . 
  [ social liberalism ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=73.2&amp;d=59.6&amp;g=62.3&amp;s=71.7 ) like most here . 
  but now i 'm curious what would happen if you send them the questions of our wahl-o-mat and have them incorporate that . 
  the format is a catalogue of talking points where all parties answer the questions according to their goals and it tries to find you a match based on those . 
  here are some interesting questions from a recent state election : * organizers of large sports events should carry part of the costs of police operations * private investors should be allowed to finance the development of roads in the state ( which is outlawed on federal level ) * the state should target a 30h work week at full compensation for all workers in the long term * more migrants should work in the police force,
