  yeah i hovered over that question and it took like a minute to register why that sounded so weird . 
  correct . 
  in general it 's much easier to remember the 4 weeks rule . 
  in general no , just the 10 days . 
  remember that we 're talking about the minimum days guaranteed by law , and that the ruling is designed to scale with how much you work . 
  hence the 4 weeks of 6 day weeks base and additional ruling to reduce that so that people with 1 day per week jobs do n't take half the year off . 
   in germany minimum vacation is 20 days and does not include weekend actually it 's [ 24 days ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/burlg/__3.html ) , and saturdays or other days you usually do n't work at count as work days for it . 
  so effectively you get 4 work weeks of vacation and if you only work three days a week that translates to a minimum of 12 days off . 
  it was worst in the eastern regions after reunification . 
  people from there suddenly got into contact with the french and english speaking world and adopted names that sounded chic but got the spelling horribly wrong . 
  the whole phenomenon is known as `` kevinismus '' in german . 
  it started as an article on the satire wiki [ uncyclopedia ] ( http://de.uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/kevinismus ) , and got popular enough from there to be the de facto name for it . 
  [ kein balg mit scheissnamen an bord ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=kein+balg+mit+schei%c3%9f+namen+an+bord&amp;tbm=isch ) ( no brat with shit name on board ) . 
  from the point of view of a single person in germany marriage means getting massive tax breaks for already spending less of your joint two incomes on housing . 
  and you think that will be different in esperanto ? 
  you 'll have the same stereotypical indian accents there if enough people speak it . 
  is there a context in this question ? 
  because my own job interview at mcdonalds in its entirety was `` i 'd like this job . '', 
  - `` sure . '', 
  trust is not an issue . 
  their job is to provide news but they are operated by people . 
  people make mistakes . 
  may it be unconscious bias , omitting things or simply making an error , it happens all the time . 
  it 's a fad right now to portrait the media as the lying devil , but i have not much reason to believe in malice . 
  it 's much more likely sloppiness . 
  sure there are a few exceptions like bild ( the tabloid ) which just does n't give a shit . 
  they 'll distort a story until it makes for a good headline . 
  but if that 's not the case , there will always slip something through you can make fun of ( like [ this ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/bgh--ip-adressen-101.html ) gem from a few days ago , in the text it reads roughly `` an internet without ip-addresses is becoming unthinkable '' - indeed ) . 
  for me it comes down to how curated you want your news . 
  it 's the friggin job of journalists to sort through loads of boring shit to select what goes on the front page . 
  if you do n't agree with how they do it you have to do it for yourself and i sure do n't have time for that . 
  all i can do is try to train my bullshit sensor , demand sources _ and actually read them _ , and get news from different sources to hopefully avoid the mistakes . 
  with the clarification of / u/non-rhetorical i think the best fit is nuclear waste disposal sites . 
  the endless debates about where to built them were ultimately a large factor in ditching nuclear energy . 
  i live near one of the main sites , and i can tell you the population is not happy about that . 
  it also did n't help that the french intended to built their disposal site near the german border - our collective backyard so to speak . 
  til . 
  i would have expected something like `` gog '' . 
  for using correct oxford spelling ? 
  pull yourself together man . 
  errr , what ? 
  how does that make any sense ? 
  do n't be put of by the stupid english name . 
  it tastes like normal cold cut with a vinegar flavour . 
  no acquiring needed . 
  i cling to that scene to explain people what the book is about . 
  if i told them all the rest , it would take an hour . 
  so i just tell them about the milk and the cereal . 
  hmm , yeah , now that you say it , those differences seem correct . 
  most likely they felt they had to have him act out _ something _ at least . 
  he does n't fit how i remember mr. nancy , nor how i thought he should behave . 
  it 's been ages since i read the book , but i remember him mostly for the `` tiger balls '' story he gives at the house on the rock . 
  now , here 's what i know and remember about the character : * he 's a trickster god who dispenses stories/wisdom . 
  he 's also lazy , convoluted and petty * he likes to describe himself as old , small and not strong . 
  given the options fight or outsmart he 'll always chose outsmart . 
  * he 's funny and happy , in the shrewd way of a really old geezer that sees a joke in everything that the young ones do n't see . 
  with that in mind , i think he 'd behave more like , say , rafiki from the lion king . 
  or pratchett 's lu-tze . 
  or q from star trek tng . 
  but that 's a totally different character from what he is like in the coming to america segment . 
  here he comes off as a revolutionary anachronism hell-bent on stirring up a revolt on the ship . 
  why does he do that ? 
  with his overly think african american vernecular and the way he teaches the slaves about the coming 300 years i can only see one purpose : to remind american viewers that slavery is evil , * m ` kay * . 
  interestingly enough in the book there are two children sold into slavery , and a chapter follows them through their whole life , which is much more gruelling than that scene in the serial . 
  the boy dies early ( and is heavily implied to be an earlier incarnation of shadow ) but only after having his front teeth broken out and after having his arm amputated after being bitten by a spider . 
  they never meet gods but they tell the reader about them and in this way bring them to america . 
  after they already introduced mr. jacquel with a very well made original story , i have no idea why they screwed up nancy like that . 
  how do you think i got to read neil gaiman ? 
   i 'm just not really feeling it . 
  is n't that the point though ? 
  afair shadow was described in the book as the type of person you forget despite his large physique . 
  and since most of the book is written from his point of view you get information about how he perceives the world , but little about himself . 
  translating that to the screen they tried to go for that shawshank redemption feeling , including the muted sound . 
  works pretty well for me . 
  i see you know how to properly mix cereal and milk !, 
  i 'm not convinced about mr. nancy so far . 
  czernobog though - this is * exactly * how he should be . 
  yes i did . 
  it 's great ( if you can look past the slog in the middle ) . 
  in my opinion : sandman is better . 
  not because american gods is bad , it 's great . 
  sandman is just a game changer . 
   but i personally do n't want my coverage to come from the government but to be something i worked hard for come on . 
  how does your personal hard work shield you from catching an illness that sends you a month into hospital and racks up a million dollars in health care ? 
  simple answer : it does n't . 
  so you have insurance , which is a fancy word for bet . 
  you bet a small amount of money that you do n't get sick , and if you get sick , the insurance covers your otherwise life destroying hospital bills . 
  and at this point there is absolutely no reason why this coverage should n't apply to everyone else too . 
  there is no relation between hard work and not getting sick . 
  there is no relation between the amount of money you pay into the insurance and the amount of money you get out of it over a life time . 
  if there was , you would n't need insurance and could simply save up for the case . 
  this has nothing to do with political sides . 
  it 's simply stepping away from looking at healthcare as something you have to earn because you already do n't do that . 
  terry pratchett - night watch , neil gaiman - sandman bonus points for that american novel that no american but every german knows : noah gordon - the physician, 
  [ franz schubert - der erlk\u00f6nig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js91p-vmsf0 ) ( ok , the singer is english , but still counts as ours ), 
  [ hgicht - tutenchamun ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnejfvu-rsw ) [ edeka commercial : supergeil ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxvcgdmbu94 ) [ walter moers - ich hock in meinem bonker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2ymo0imfk ) and our answer to casetteboy : [ cyber cyber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy6kkrss26m ), 
  only the ones that sound useful , like anoia , goddess of things stuck in drawers and friday , saint patron of the office worker . 
  the first is not so much an argument against vat but against all flat taxes , sales tax included . 
  the second one is tricky . 
  private usage like this counts as [ non-paid transfer of value ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/unentgeltliche_wertabgabe ) , and yes the company get back that vat _ but _ the employee has to pay full vat for private usage .
