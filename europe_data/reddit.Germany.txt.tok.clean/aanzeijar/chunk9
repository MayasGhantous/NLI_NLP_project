  so in theory no vat gets lost . 
  in practice i 'm sure they 'll still have ways to dodge taxes . 
  ( same caveats apply , i 'm not an accountant ), 
  oh , i did n't know that . 
  thanks, 
  germans , no humour , you know the deal . 
  but seriously , they struggle with the same question . 
  on one hand it appeals to their backwater voters , on the other hand they wo n't let it get in the way of appealing to irreligious voters . 
  their official [ self-concept ] ( https://www.cdu.de/artikel/selbstverstaendnis-der-cdu ) weasels around the issue with the following statement ( translation by me ) :  the basis of our politics is the christian understanding of the human being and their responsibility before god . 
  our basic values of freedom , solidarity and justice are derived from that . 
  the cdu is open for anybody who agrees with the dignity and freedom of all human beings and the resulting fundamental credo of our politics . 
  and no matter what you would * call * your parties , in practice , what are the chances you 'll elect a president who 's openly not christian ? 
  the main benefit is that it 's easier to combat tax evasion in the supply chain . 
  with sales tax you only tax the retail sale , so if someone `` accidentally '' forgets to declare that , the state loses all of the tax revenue . 
  with vat , you _ always _ pay tax for everything you buy , no matter for what , but if you are a business you can get that tax back . 
  so for each business in the supply chain it makes sense to accurately declare their taxes , or they wo n't get the tax back they paid on their raw material . 
  over the course of the production chain , each sale adds value to the product , and you effectively only tax the added value in each step - hence vat . 
  edit : and while that sounds great , it also has negative sides . 
  one example would be construction business where materials are really hard to track , so vat does n't apply there . 
  tax is simply applied on the finished construction . 
  another problem is international trade . 
  i should know this crap because i work on software doing this , but taxing international transactions is a nightmare and anything more complicated than company a in france buying from company b in germany is a minefield . 
  to be honest , it means there are americans around talking about their clusterfuck of a political system . 
  the party that could be translated as liberal is libertarian and currently recovering from being clinically dead for the better part of a decade . 
  conservatives sounds like something you advertise your food not to have ( preservatives are * konservierungsstoffe * in german ) . 
  since we have more parties you usually talk about specific talking points aligned with those parties . 
  for example no one ( politically ) cares about gay rights , anti-racism or rehabilitative justice here . 
  the first two are not political talking points but are something all politicians agree to be self-evident ( ok , except the afd ) and we already have the third one . 
  if gay rights ever come up , it 's the much more hotly debated topic of * ehegattensplitting * , the tax benefits for married couples designed to promote having children that does n't really work . 
  and surprisingly even the cdu , our centre right party with the c standing for christian , is slightly in favour of wording that to support unmarried or gay couples with children . 
  other points you hear about would be the greens wanting to shut down nuclear energy . 
  but in this case for example that point got popular after fukushima , so it was quickly adopted by all major parties . 
  another major one would be the introduction of minimum wage , which was a talking point of the socialists for years , but when it got introduced it was with the blessing of all parties ( [ source with votes by party on that ] ( https://www.bundestag.de/parlament/plenum/abstimmung/abstimmung/?id=290 ) ) . 
  thanks a lot , i could n't find anything on that . 
   honestly , this never occurred to me and i had to google it . 
  :d i know that feeling . 
  sometimes i wander into r/german and find people citing obscure rules i 've never heard about . 
  so you 're the other guy !, 
  / s whenever i look into the discussion board at duolingo it 's 99 % german , french and spanish , then a long time nothing and it feels like only 2 people take the smaller courses . 
  i do . 
  in my personal simple progression gauge of `` is able to read harry potter in that language '' i 'm still short of a lot of vocab though . 
  the worst part for me is ou -  \u03bf\u03c5 . 
  i have mistyped that so often . 
  and for some reason my brain always tries to move my finger to `` dev '' instead of `` den '' for \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd . 
  greek on duolingo . 
  [ wikipedia talk pages are cheating ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk:nazi_party/archive_5#nazi_can_not_be_far_right_by_definition ), 
  well , i know people from dresden ... 
  oh , we 've definitely got some good stuff . 
  arte , phoenix , zdfneo , zdfkultur , the official [ rock am ring ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnrx1uv6mdq ) broadcast . 
  but that 's a drop in the ocean of bovine excrement that is the rest of german tv . 
  most of our good or mediocre shows have been shamelessly stolen from the brits for decades . 
  remember 'till death do us part ? 
  there 's a german version of it . 
  and even there they managed to screw some up . 
  the german version of the it crowd was so horrible that they cancelled it after the pilot . 
  the rest is filled with vomit inducing low budget scripted reality drama , dubbed sitcoms from abroad , talk shows , or the thousandth rerun of hogan 's heroes . 
  at least that was the case when i stopped watching tv . 
  ah , so it 's about agenda2010 . 
  no idea if you should emulate that to be honest . 
  which of the german models you 're talking about here ? 
  export driven economy ? 
  engineering ? 
  agenda2010 ? 
  [ hamburger royal mit k\u00e4se ] ( https://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produkt-profil?productname=hamburger_royal_mit_kase ) , usually just called royal k\u00e4se for short , and that also only because someone thought a version with tomatoes and salad was a good idea which necessitates the clarification . 
  and yes , the scene is dubbed exactly like in the english version . 
  it 's where i learned about quarter pounder . 
   i just call all of you bavarians ( \u00b0 \u00b0 ) \u21d2 | \u0971\u0971 |, 
  remember that the current states of germany are basically arbitrarily drawn borders after the war . 
  identification is more regional than with states . 
  for example there are those people in [ upper franconia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upper_franconia ) that will get pissed when you call then bavarians . 
  ^ ( which you should do . 
  all the time . ), 
  we could open up an economy based on iron ladies . 
  they are scarce enough to retain value and can be expended for renewable public outrage , which is a known clean energy . 
  not without a completely new definition of how such a state should define itself . 
  the nation and empire models are n't really hot right now . 
  if anything , we 'll slowly get there by integrating more and more of the local governments into a higher authority of a eu federalism . 
  you decide if that counts for a country or not . 
   the crust is so hard and sharp that it rips the living shit out of your roof of your mouth and makes your gums bleed . 
  we have to compensate for not cooking spicy somehow , do n't we ? 
  nice try disguising your sandwich as a [ piece of cake ] ( https://i0.wp.com/jernrive.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/img_2439.jpg ) , it still looks like the jam is bleeding out to escape the horrible peanut butter . 
  also i 'll have you know that calling grey bread `` toast '' disqualifies you from any discussion about taste in europe . 
  easy !, 
  look at these two illustrations : [ pb sandwich ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/522/584/d7c.png ) [ nutellabrot ] ( http://www.spektrum.de/fm/912/thumbnails/nutellabrot_fotolia76478423_a_bruno.jpg.1726352.jpg ) superior bread , superior spread . 
  very clear decision . ^ ( / s should go without saying ), 
  in all honesty - how should we know ? 
  because it 's essentially fat with peanuts and there is simply no circumstance where i 'd like to eat that . 
  i already prefer hazelnuts , walnuts , pistachios and cashew over peanuts as a snack . 
  for nut/fat mixtures we have nutella which is clearly superior . 
  i hear you do n't have real nutella in the states and i 'm sad that this is possible . 
  and by real i mean the german version of course . 
  then you try to make up for it and put peanut butter on every other food item - and it just does n't work . 
  it 's like dill or caraway . 
  it invades the flavour and aroma of everything you put it on and assaults you with a sledgehammer . 
  so , for me i 'll gladly pass on that one table spoon as well thank you very much . 
  the point is , while it is possible to slack on benefits in germany the system is designed with the assumption that you ca n't really distinguish between the slacker and someone who is genuinely in need , you simply do it because letting people rot in the street is not an option . 
  that 's presumably why blitzbasic said `` regardless of the reason '' . 
  i 'm not trying to attack you for it , we know it 's a widely held attitude in the states when it comes to welfare just as the `` regardless of reason '' stance is widespread here . 
  but it 's fascinating for me that you simply brush that off with the story about the immigrant boy when the same simply does n't work in a place with a desolate economy ( like the one i picked specifically for  30 % poverty rate and a geographical position that allows little alternative nearby ) . 
  from the perspective of running a country it does n't matter if they sit at home or sit in an office stamping insurance claims .
