  it 's nothing . 
  one german company got 100 % off their fine other german company got 40 % off their fine best buddies company also got 50 % off their fine so yeah one set of rules for germany , another for everyone else . 
  eu is just a tool to serve german interests . 
  uk left because of it . 
  since germans took over the leading role , eu was crises after crises . 
  because they only care for their own interest , nothing else . 
  pretty sure that was what stalin said after removing people . 
  `` well find people that do n't support me '', 
   every european country is selling stuff to russia `` despite sanctions '' - simply because these goods are n't covered by the sanctions . 
  that 's pretty much how sanctions work . 
  turbines ? 
  already forgotten about that . 
  those were covered by sanctions . 
  well `` siemens did n't know russia will use them in crimea '' my dead grandmother could come up with a better excuse . 
  it 's not even mentioned that russia deployed two more turbines from siemens recently https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-siemens-turbine-iduskbn19x2z9  not violating any sanctions . 
   which pipeline are you talking about ? 
  south stream ? 
  sorry mate , but germany supported south stream . 
  it 's violating the spirit of it . 
  and no the germany did not support south stream . 
  nor any other eu member . 
  germany literally promised to pay bulgaria for money lost by dropping the south stream , how the fuck is that supporting it . 
   where ? 
  oh i see we 've already forgotten about the volkswagen cheating their enviroment regulations of the eu . 
  ahh it 's the germans , who cares about it . 
  they can cheat everyone will forget it . 
   so far this is only an allegation and if it proves true , they will be punished for it . 
  lmao , right . 
  like every other instance where germ companies cheated . 
  still having to print the maps without serbia in it , 
  of course a germ would say that . 
  but everytime you look for things , it 's always germany or german companies . 
  selling stuff to russia despite sanctions , making new gas lines despite the sanctions , making others shutdown their gas line project though , cheating eu regulations , making car industry cartels . 
  but somehow nothing ever comes of it or germany punished . 
  so one set of rules for you guys , one for everyone else . 
  one of the reasons i am oh so glad we 're not in the eu . 
  as always in the eu , one set of rules for germany , the other set for everyone else , 
  it says ,  days of serbian culture in istria  will be held in home of croatian defenders ( that 's how they call their soldiers who fought in the 90s ) you can imagine the combo of holding days of serbian culture in such a place, 
  i 'm a huge fan of istria since they did this https://i.imgur.com/cjybhzw.jpg they 're good lads . 
  uh-oh , where to start , this subreddit is so nice to people friendly with russia choose the most appropriate description or insult that you are going to use bulgaria is a russian : 1 . 
  spy 3 . 
  trojan horse, 
  probaj do vasingtona mozda je vasa ali je i nasa http://slobodnimediji.com/images/novembar2016/melanija-tramp-9-620x350.jpg, 
  but in what way ? 
  it still stands that their systems wo n't be able to be used against russia . 
  why is it okay to have such systems for bulgaria and romania but not for turkey ? 
  and i 'm pretty sure nato has nothing about buying things from russia in it 's rules . 
  there is really no controversy here . 
  yeah could n't teach a fly how to fly . 
  proven by your ignorance `` serbs are the only one who did ethnic cleansing '' while there 's a mile long article of who did it throughout history to today . 
  also being completely ignorant of the facts of what even happened . 
  with teachers like that ... 
   not really . 
  napoleon did n't do ethnic cleansing as far as i know ... romans conquered a vast territory and did n't kill every living people in there everytime they moved in . 
  that 's just few examples . 
  and neither did we no matter how you want to twist the facts . 
  ( killed every living thing everytime we moved in ) you know even if we take the 8000 number for srebrenica to be accurate , 26000 people were evacuated from it . 
  by serbs . 
  this is n't even propaganda , everybody agrees on that , there are even video proof of that . 
  women and children were n't touched at all , only military aged men . 
  ethnic cleansing is a made up term that was only made to polarise everything . 
  bosnians did the exact same thing when they captured the towns ? 
  the same . 
  look it up in wikipedia lasva valley ethnic cleansing . 
  you think they stood trial for that or were ever negatively portrayed because of it ? 
  nobody did anything that was n't done previously by any army . 
  romans did n't cleanse everyone ? 
  remember carthage ? 
  remember jews ( by romans , several times , not by germans ) napoleon did the same to military aged men . 
  pretend all you want , but please , do n't try to bring me into your bullshit . 
  and last i checked neither bosniaks or muslims are a race . 
  and last i checked croats did the exact same things to them as i mentioned . 
  but were never on trial for it or negatively portrayed  i wonder why . 
  same reason you do n't learn that napoleon did the same things . 
  or any other leader in any other war . 
  better to keep it forgotten . 
  i know you wo n't believe anything i say , but i 'm correct . 
  you had words for it before us even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing  an antecedent to the term is the greek word andrapodismos ( greek : \u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 ; lit . 
  `` enslavement '' ) , which was used in ancient texts to describe atrocities that accompanied alexander the great 's conquest of thebes in 335 bc . 
  [ 3 ] in the early 1900s , regional variants of the term could be found among the czechs ( o\u010dista ) , the poles ( oczyszczanie ) , the french ( \u00e9puration ) and the germans ( s\u00e4uberung ) . 
  [ 4 ] [ page needed ] a 1913 carnegie endowment report condemning the actions of all participants in the balkan wars contained various new terms to describe brutalities committed toward ethnic groups . 
  [ 5 ]  during world war ii , the euphemism \u010di\u0161\u0107enje terena ( `` cleansing the terrain '' ) was used by the croatian usta\u0161e to describe military actions in which non-croats were purposely killed or otherwise uprooted from their homes . 
  [ 6 ] viktor guti\u0107 , a senior usta\u0161e leader , was one of the first croatian nationalists on record to use the term as a euphemism for committing atrocities against serbs . 
  [ 7 ] the term was later used in the internal memorandums of serbian nationalist guerrillas in reference to a number of retaliatory massacres they committed against bosniaks and croats between 1941 and 1945 . 
  `` cleansing of borders '' ) was used in soviet documents of the early 1930s to refer to the forced resettlement of polish people from the 22-kilometre ( 14 mi ) border zone in the byelorussian and ukrainian ssrs . 
  this process was repeated on an even larger scale in 1939 -- 41 , involving many other groups suspected of disloyalty towards the soviet union . 
  [ 9 ] during the holocaust , nazi germany pursued a policy of ensuring that europe was `` cleansed of jews '' ( judenrein ) . 
  [ 10 ] according to israeli historian benny morris , the term `` cleansing '' was used in israeli military documents dating to the 1948 israeli -- arab war , referring to the expulsion of arabs from israel . 
  [ 11 ]  in the 1980s , the soviets used the term `` ethnic cleansing '' to describe the inter-ethnic violence in nagorno-karabakh . 
  [ 3 ] at around the same time , the yugoslav media used it to describe what they alleged was an albanian nationalist plot to force all serbs to leave kosovo . 
  it was widely popularized by the western media during the bosnian war ( 1992 -- 95 ) . 
  the first recorded mention of its use in the western media can be traced back to an article in the new york times dated 15 april 1992 , in a quote by an anonymous western diplomat . 
  [ 6 ] literally every single country in the world did it , even in modern times , so get off your high horse and stop acting so noble https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns also  it was widely popularized by the western media during the bosnian war ( 1992 -- 95 ) . 
  nobody cared before it , nobody cares after it . 
  you have the same things happening in syria , in iraq , in afghanistan anywhere where there is war . 
  something was just needed to bring the `` evil serbs '' to justice and promote and international campaign and response , so the the `` un '' could take over bosnia . 
  you know they still are in control of bosnia right ? 
  of course i 'm not saying they 're the only factor . 
  i 'm just saying one fucking memorandum did n't do it or was the catalyst for it , that 's fucking ridiculous . 
  what you say its my point exactly .
