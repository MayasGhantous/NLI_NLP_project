  they would , up until the 1990s in massive numbers , so it would be far from a gain of 3 million people . 
  people would still be leaving in massive numbers , and plus on top of that having abortions . 
  because romania would still be shit compared to western europe . 
  in yugoslavia over 25 % of the population during 70s , 80s , worked abroad , most did n't come back . 
   they did n't choose , they were forced , that 's why birth rates dropped so fast after communism fell . 
  what the government stood by their beds to make sure everytime you they had sex they 'd make a child ? 
   yes , they too have low birthrates , but because their economies are in a better shape , they have more people coming to their countries than leaving . 
  the issue here that people are bitching about is native population dying of . 
  not much better . 
  you 're under some kind of delusion that romania would receive the same amount of help as germany or france to rebuild after the war . 
  in reality you 'd be left pretty much alone . 
   without the totalitarian communist regime there would be no need to rebuild after the mistakes of the commie regime , because romania had such advanced infrastructure and no mistakes before the commies right ? 
  wrong , it was a shit compared to western europe way before the soviets and it was shit during the soviets . 
  no it 's not . 
   our economy would most likely be in a better shape people already had worse economy than now and they choose to have more children . 
  also western europe has the same problem . 
  discount immigration and native births are always lower than deaths . 
  soviets to blame for that too ? 
  while you 're already thinking give a nice thought to how in every western country native population also have more deaths than births . 
  are soviets to blame for that too ? 
  but that simply is n't true . 
  if you discount immigration every country in western europe has below more deaths than births in their native population . 
  are they victims of communism also ? 
  one of their `` art '' performances . 
  oh , okay sorry this was in the museum . 
  my point is they deserved to be arrested for a lot of stuff . 
  hooliganism in a church was just the latest in long streak or law breaking and stupid things they 've done https://medium.com/@zarinazabrisky/scandal-insanity-art-language-f8f497e4678a, 
  and once again , nothing to do with economy issues or people moving . 
  but simply a policy issue of todays government . 
  they can give lots of benefits to women with more kids now , but they do n't . 
  which is one the main reasons the population is declining . 
  you have it now . 
  look at it and imagine . 
  every western country also has negative growth when you discount the immigration . 
  but this does . 
  nsfw obviously . 
  so you would say it 's the fault of the policies of todays government , and not of the communist/soviet one ? 
  it has really nothing to do with economy or communism , since `` in the civilized world '' the have the exact same issue . 
  they just have immigration . 
  mate if they 're having an orgy in a church , that 's not protesting in any shape , way or form . 
   statistics show growth of lssr and free republic of lithuania , it does n't show ethnic growth . 
  you mean except at the point where it clearly divides the population by ethnicity and where you can see it increased in native lithuanians ? 
   you meant more colonists than deaths . 
   because our partisans killed soviet collaborationists and russian colonists . 
  you ca n't even agree with yourself , but sure continue to parade whatever you want , clearly facts mean nothing to you . 
  that was just in estonia and that population drop between 1934 and 1959 can easily be accounted to ww ii you know well ... germans had a plan for the baltic people https://i.imgur.com/a3prwar.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost so you can hardly blame the entire drop on the soviets . 
  it was war , people died on all sides , to soviets , to nazis , to local freedom fighters , mines ... and let 's see . 
  after 1959 the native population was always steadily increasing . 
  and going that way . 
  up until 1991 . 
  oh really ? 
  so what you 're saying is it 's not the soviets fault your birthrates are falling but the fault of your own government and it 's policies ? 
  that was my entire point . 
  just find it funny how former soviet countries blame everything on them , especially the balts . 
   what are you talking about , lithuanians were getting either brutally killed or deported to siberia , while russian colonists were brought , lithuanian population did not grow , russian population did grow in lithuania . 
  except the statistics disagrees . but okay live in your own world . 
   lithuanian population did not grow , russian population did grow in lithuania . 
  it clearly shows it did . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_lithuania#after_world_war_ii https://i.imgur.com/pwknuk2.png  population growing up until 1991 in native lithuanians to 2.9 million  2011 it `` grows '' to 2.5 million  soviet population was killing off people left and right , of course our death per birth ration will not be equal . 
  mate ... you had more births than deaths under the soviets . 
  were the soviets killing off your babies after 1991 ? 
  is that what you 're saying ? 
   so you 're denying the fact that people are travelling to western countries due to economic reasons not enough to account for the difference . 
   soviets did not kill lithuanians it does n't matter for population growth , you had positive growth with them killing you . 
  native lithuanians had positive growth . 
  which one should i look at ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_estonia#ethnic_groups estonia also shows increasing population in estonians up until 1990 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_latvia#ethnic_groups so does latvia . 
  ( an increase of latvians up until 1990 , not of estonians ) so which baltic state am i missing ? 
   do you live here ? 
  near enough . 
   those stats just show that people do n't want to have kids in a shitty country . 
  you would say that life now is better than under communism in romania ? 
  yes ? 
  so why were people having more children in an even shittier country than now ? 
   also birth rates went down after ww2 in romania because of communism so after romania stopped being a communist country the birthrates dropped because of communism ? 
  but they were fine while communism ruled because of capitalism ? 
  am i your logic here right ? 
   also birth rates went down after the revolution because so many people started leaving . 
  less women less birth rates . 
  not enough to account for the difference . 
  maybe you 're talking or thinking of some other baltic country , but that is n't the case for lithuania . 
  https://i.imgur.com/ujl1kz8.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_lithuania#after_world_war_ii it clearly is showing increase in lithuanian native population up until 1991 . 
  then a decrease since then . 
   we were still losing people , because soviet regime killed people left and right . 
  young people would self-immolate themselves to protest against soviet regime . 
  but you had positive growth so overall there was more lithuanians , since not 10000 of you each year did n't immolate themselves . 
   also the fact that due to communism our economy got set back 50 years , it 's quite obvious people will seek higher paid job in foreign countries once border was opened bullshit but okay , the main reason for the negative growth is n't anybody leaving but births that are way below deaths . 
  here https://i.imgur.com/izq2ljj.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_lithuania#after_world_war_ii_2  you can push your commie agenda as much as you want , i ai n't buying it . 
  not pushing any propaganda , just find it funny how you manage to blame everything on the soviets . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is fuck more and have more children and you wo n't have that problem . 
   it has to do with everything . 
  if it was n't for communism we would n't have had so many people fleeing the east it 's far from that , it 's mostly not to `` people fleeing east '' , but the birthrates that are terribly down and below even replecement levels . 
  since 1991 every year in romania more people die , less people are born . 
  here https://i.imgur.com/somgpvt.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_romania#after_wwii, 
  ... you know during communism each country in the eastern europe had positive annual population growth without accepting any migrants . 
  only reason the west has now is because of immigration . 
  here 's for your own country . 
  https://i.imgur.com/v9mfqex.png 1990 - +1 % growth 2010 - -2.4 % growth it was only since the fall of communism you started dying out . 
  sure i agree , but he made it sound like it 's the fault of every religion , when that is not the case . 
  it 's not really the fault of the religion itself but the people in charge of both religion and government .
