to me ? 
  less than $ 150/yr . 
  i do n't understand . 
  apparently speed limit enforcement by cameras is much more efficient than doing it with actual policemen . 
  meh , i drive 20 more all the time and get less than half a dozen tickets between $ 15 and $ 35 per year , so what . 
  i think of this expense as a `` fee for permit to drive faster . 
  i checked and it turns out i was incorrect , i should have known because parking on a disabled space is $ 70 and there appear to be plenty others over $ 20 . 
  [ long list in german ] ( https://www.bussgeldkatalog.org/halten-parken/ ) . 
  anyhow , in case the actual perpetrator can not be found the owner of the car has to pay the costs - $ 18.50 and nothing else . 
  one can not punish a person if one has no proof that this person did it . 
   and if the parking fine is higher than $ 20 they wait until the driver returns ? 
  :p there are no parking fines over $ 20 . 
   do n't know , the owner of the car is always fined . 
  if somebody else was driving , that 's the owners ' problem then . 
  can not do that in german law . 
   we fine based on the license plate , and the registered owner of the car will recieve the fine regardless of who was driving . 
  in germany that 's only possible for parking fines up to $ 20 . 
   the driver is not visible on the pictures , no matter what angle ( front or rear ) the picture was taken . 
  why not ? 
  on our tickets they even print the picture of the face ( and the plate ) so you really know it 's you . 
   yep those . 
  i 'm always in doubt when seeing those . 
  do n't worry , their data must not be used for anything else . 
  although there is one exception for searching for actual murderers . 
   and be warned on the autobahn , germans flash you from the front . 
  you do n't ? 
  if the police does n't get a picture of the drivers face they can not enforce the fine against the driver . 
   why do you guys by the way have camera 's nearly all over the autobahn , even when there 's no limit ? 
  [ those ] ( http://www.radarfalle.de/technik/ueberwachungstechnik/images/maut_1.jpg ) ? 
  these are for the automated toll control system . 
  i would hate being stopped by police every time , that 's annoying . 
  just send me the ticket in the mail . 
  really ? 
  i 'd say 160-180 seems to be most peoples comfort zone in germany . 
  trouble is the wrong word , it 's just that your own insurance will only pay half your own car in that case . . 
  finally a category in which even the americans can not claim to have more freedom . 
  there is really no reason that fast food has to be bad . 
   mcdonald 's looks nicer in europe than in the us , i ( german ) have eaten at mcdonalds in canada and the usa and can honestly say : it tasted like shit , i will never eat their again . 
  european mcds are soooo much better , italian being best . 
   it looked like they were trying to compete with places like subway , which is a definite step upward in quality in america . 
  the canadian subway i went to was very bad compared to our subways . 
  and our subways are n't even considered particulary good food . 
  i know . 
  the point was to explain to you that none of the current eu members country is outside of the eu . 
  i literally asked him to name out-of-europe possessions that are not current possessions of current eu members . 
  so , no , in-europe do not count because they are irrelevant to this discussion . 
   european union has many territories outside europe . 
  like ... ? 
  out-of-europe possessions of current eu members do n't count . 
  google says it means  well , until tomorrow and , as they say in madrid , ` with the cane it is spain ' cane apparently being the kind made of reed used to , well , cane stuff . 
  my best guess is it means `` by gavelling it will be spain '' and in context of ending a meeting i guess it refers humourously to the concept of siesta . 
  a lot of course , that 's the point . 
  but not ** everything ** besides the engine . 
  normal persons ? 
  nope . 
   tesla gets the headlines when it comes to evs in norway , but the e-golf actually sells very , very , well here . 
  we buy them as fast as vw can build them . 
  we 're a small market , but still . 
  ah , yeah , i forgot about that . 
  but of course you only buy it because of the huge incentives . 
   increased heat making equatorial africa and asia unliveable leading to huge amounts of climate refugees migrating to europe on a scale several orders of magnitude larger than currently . 
  oh that wo n't bother us , we would build a giant fence around europe . 
  they can live in egypt for all i care . 
   famine in europe due to our inability to import food from other parts of the world ( also , acidification of the ocean could destroy our ability to source sea food at all further worsening the famine ) . 
  do we really need to import food ? 
  i did n't know that my beefs is sent from australia , when did that start ? 
   sea level rises will likely sink large parts european coastal cities within our life time ( and beyond our life time we could even see non-coastal cities like berlin being sunk ) . 
  that seems hugely exaggerated . 
   additionally this will create a scramble for resources which could potentially lead to resource wars between major world powers . 
  this would significantly increase the risks of nuclear war within our lifetime , especially given that far more countries have nuclear weapons today than at the most dangerous point during the cold war ( the cuban missile crisis of 1962-3 ) . 
  war , sure . 
  but in far far away shitholes nobody cares about . 
  why ? 
  that makes perfect sense , if the hungarians have less razor-wire more syrians can leave turkey . 
  are we supposed to boycott these companies now or why is this news ? 
   in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change . 
  which are what actually ? 
  some species dying out ? 
  happened all the time over the several billion years . 
  what else ? 
  maledives sinking ? 
  they can go and live somewhere that 's not here . 
  nobody is disputing that it 's getting warmer and there is pretty good evidence suggesting it 's caused by us . 
  but to date i have n't seen something predicted that will actually make * my * life worse . 
    til an audi is totally the same as a skoda . 
   you picked the worst example possible . 
  skodas in large parts are built on audi basis - their engines are usually last generation audi engines . 
  i actually picked , by coincidence , the best example possible . 
  skoda are very different from audis . 
  but sure , switch skoda to dacia if you please . 
   actually it is n't . 
  the range of the golf isnt that good , unfortunately . 
  that 's why no one is buying it obviously . 
  but it 's still a better ** car ** than whatever tesla can come up with . 
   but to make a comparison , you will need to compare the 2017 e golf to the model 3 , not the 2014 one . 
  which will be even more in favour of the golf . 
  of course it is . 
  want a cookie ? 
   in europe , you forgot to add ... ? 
  it an overpriced gadget with mediocre interiour quality ** everywhere ** .
