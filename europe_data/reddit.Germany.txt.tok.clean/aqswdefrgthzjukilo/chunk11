  to which i was obviously forced . 
  anyway , it might be different for officers , although i met plenty , but most of them liked the idea of a paycheck during university . 
  ah , apparently that 's correct . 
  still no reason to attack afghanistan . 
  i kinda get that the usa wanted to do it because they fucked that country up in the first place and wanted to correct that mistake , but we should n't have been forced to come along . 
   you have to go to war for estonia , else you may end up having to go to war for lithuania or poland or germany or whoever in the futur yeah , that 's the thing with appeasement . 
  apparently that does n't work . 
  sure , but those feeling berufen to be a soldier out of a need to serve are very rare . 
  i 've met one or two during my time in the service , great guys , very honorable . 
  but most soldiers are just the same as in the usa : too dumb to get any other job , unlucky , born in east germany ( no jobs around there ) or love to shoot guns . 
  it 's not bad per se , but we do n't understand why anyone would care about them ? 
  they are getting paid , are they not ? 
  why would i send stuff to deployed soldiers ? 
  they already have all the stuff they need . 
   while in germany most people will think you 're either very right-leaning , a gun-nut , or too stupid to find any other line of work . 
  is n't that true for most americans who joined their military ? 
  military town ? 
  the whole of san diego is inhabitated by the military ? 
  and even if , why would that change anything ? 
   obiter dicta : my argument was , and this is crucial to understand , that the dude put himself in danger ( despite maybe having a differing political opinion himself ! ), 
  just to do what the public asked of him . 
  they asked him in the way the public agreed on . 
  whatever the justification , he did it for a paycheck . 
  he got a paycheck . 
  our debt to him was paid with money , we do n't have to be thankful . 
  you can not actually believe that . 
  neither was usa attacked * by any country or other military force * nor were there any terrorists hiding in afghanistan . 
  i pushed personnel files for ten months during my service , do i get thanks ? 
   schr\u00f6der told the us after 9/11 `` uneingeschr\u00e4nkte solidarit\u00e4t '' und they demanded troops . 
  if you tell your ally you do anything and they ask for something you do it . 
  yeah , he just should n't have said that . 
  how does the number of soldiers matter ? 
  our constitution prohibits us from invading anyone , yet still we did . 
  hence the unpopularness . 
  and yet we still are in afghanistan ... 
  the title is quite incorrect . 
  the question to which 58 % of germans answered `` no '' was : * should we help a nato country that is bordering russia if it is attacked by russia . 
  that 's just common sense , really . 
  at the same time ** 68 % ** of germans are convinced that nato ** will ** help that country , whether or not they approve of it . 
   but it was n't the alliance undertaking the aggressive wars . 
  did you miss when the usa invoked article 5 to support it 's war against terror ? 
  the * only * time article 5 was ever invoked it was used to invade a country somewhere in asia because the usa had a bad day . 
  and i 'm quite sure we already send some fighter jets to estonia . 
  do you really think the uk would go to war to free ... estonia ? 
  seriously ? 
   you are perfectly free to think so . 
  but should n't you have decided that before joining nato ? 
  which was basically founded for this sole purpose - fight russia ( ussr ) if it attacks one of the members . 
  germany joined nato much earlier than estonia . 
  letting estonia in was a political decision to weaking russia , nothing else . 
  i doubt any nato nation , including the usa , will go to war if putin would occupy estonia . 
   additional question : do you think german independence or german lives are worth the risk of a war between us and russia ? 
  obviously . 
  please stop asking loaded questions . 
  holy shit , who the fuck cares ? 
  in italy maybe . 
  do n't worry , that is obvious to anyone . 
  obviously , we only catch the dumb ones . 
   but what am i saying : back when the kiel channel was built , people were compensated generously and toll-free ferries installed . 
  they 're still free , today . 
  the kaiser treated his people better than the current government . 
  i know , i 've been on those ferries . 
  well , one of them . 
   maybe if the planners would have thought beforehand about the impact it would have on people those would n't have exercised their democratic rights , because it would not have been necessary . 
  just maybe . 
  probably both parties at fault . 
  stuttgart21 was completely planned and all was done and then people showed up and protested for absolutely no reason . 
   and much , much new infrastructure is supposed to be built . 
  most of the current track is n't even electrified . 
  and guess what the rechnungshof says [ 1 ] ( one of the two sane institutions we have on the federal level ) . 
  so that was caused by people like you . 
  good job !, 
    the east is lost . 
  everyone that could move already did so , what is left are those too old or too dumb or too ugly . 
   be that as it may , we need to repopulate it . 
  also , that way lies the baltic states where people are beautiful . 
  nah , we should turn that into our version of idaho or ohio . 
  lots of giant grain field and few people . 
  and a high speed track to berlin and from there to poland of course . 
  i 'm not opposed to rail baltica mind you , and it would probably make sense to include the tunnel to rostock in that . 
    dude , the danes will build the tunnel , its cost does not concern us . 
   the connecting infrastructure we 're going to have to pay will cost billions . 
  yes , of course . 
   fehmarn , as you might now , is a tourist island . 
  the whole area is . 
  now i do n't presume to claim that it 's impossible to lay tracks etc. 
  in a way that will not fuck up the business , but then you got ta add a couple of billions more . 
  wtf ? 
  the tunnel will connect to the existing tracks . 
  you know that ferries ferry trains over the belt , where did you think those went ? 
   more . 
  even with the a20 in place roads are meandering , and trains have to go via hamburg . 
  with rostock , both would have straight-line connections to berlin . 
  if you 're comparing it with the rostock < -  gedser ferry i 'd say at least 6 hours . 
  it 's still far more traffic that wants to go south , not east . 
   and from the german perspective : the east needs traffic and infrastructure . 
  especially brandenburg . 
  the east is lost . 
  everyone that could move already did so , what is left are those too old or too dumb or too ugly . 
   and when it comes to cargo traffic that 's not time-critical : of course it is , sometimes at least .
