  and normal eurovision friendly voting . 
  but that 's actually your own problem . 
   that kept crapping out . 
  did n't that only happen once with portugal ? 
  and how would anyone know it was microsoft ? 
  and why would microsoft even be involved , what happened to tv feeds we used for decades ? 
  i actually preferred her , but zero points ... damn . 
  that 's just unbelievable . 
  yeah , i 've been to stockholm . 
  wasteland confirmed . 
  yeah , sure , but i do n't understand how you planned for the next one to be in herning . 
  did you even participate this year ? 
  what connection ? 
  yeah , that 's not debatable . 
  if we are footing the bill we damn sure have a place in the final . 
  the swede only won because of his gimmick , no other reason . 
  german and uk songs were both perfectly okay for a 10-16th place finish . 
  i have no idea what happened . 
  [ could n't find a picture , here is a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtjjjbkilcu ) of das ass singing another song , which i actually thought would have been a better entry . 
  das ass . 
  but it was funny this time because it parodied russian voting practices . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  bullshit , nobody voted politically . 
  no , that was a really good joke . 
  nothing uncomfortable about it . 
  i 'm confused ... i 've been to herning , it 's not in sweden . 
  i 'm pretty sure of that . 
  we actually discussed that during our esc party and concluded : yes , you may host it , ** if ** it will still air live at 9pm cet . 
  i really liked your entry by the way and thought it would make the top3 . 
  i actually preferred her song , but am equally confused how it 's possible to get * zero * points . 
  i thought she would finish somewhere 12-16th . . 
    this was a public performance , they would n't have to pay for what they do in private . 
   with the consideration that anyone not part of your household makes it a public performance in their view . 
  no ... but you do n't really care about the facts , do you ? 
    you use the term `` reimbursed '' but do not know what it means , you would n't have to pay a single cent . 
   you do , you have to pay a fee when you organize an event . 
  you do n't if you only play free music . 
    and of course you have to keep records for when you sing in public . 
   even when you do n't charge people for it , which is insane . 
  obviously it does n't matter if people are charged , you are an idiot . 
  or do you really think you could show the most recent blockbuster , or any other non-public-domain movie for that matter , in public without paying for it ? 
  but you are n't charging people , are you ? 
  it should be free , right ? 
  why wo n't you people just think for a second . 
  the nsa is still to blame , after all without them the bnd would n't have done that . 
  they should be educated abotu the fact that germany does n't do invasions of foreign countries since about 70 years ago . 
  it 's literally forbidden in our constitution ... 
   the divide on britain is pretty surprising . 
  why are germans lukewarm on the u.k. ? 
  might have something to do with the fact they are spying on us and are generally ungrateful bitches who bitch about the eu ? 
   that 's not even an argument . 
  why is it fair that people have to pay tribute to some faceless overlord for hosting a child 's birthday party ? 
  it 's a fair assumption they would be making/playing music for which they would have to pay . 
  this was a ** public ** performance , they would n't have to pay for what they do in private . 
   not at all , now i have to keep records of every children 's gathering , and then i have to file a claim that has to be processed so i can be reimbursed . 
  you use the term `` reimbursed '' but do not know what it means , you would n't have to pay a single cent . 
  and of course you have to keep records for ** when you sing in public ** . 
   hoooold on , that 's different . 
  getting a residency permit and reporting your stay are two very different things . 
  a residency permit is an official document with an often lengthy procedure to obtain and has an expiration date . 
  reporting your stay just means you go to the town hall or appropriate place in your country and sign a document so the country knows you exist . 
  you can stay for as long as you want ; you just need to report your leave if you do leave . 
  some countries do give you a residency permit when you do that . 
   most importantly , you can be deported for failing to obtain a residency permit . 
  you can not be deported for failing to report your stay if you 're an eu citizen , though you can be fined . 
  in your original comment you implied eu citizens needed a residency permit which is adamantly not true . 
  i did not , but i will concede that it may have been misunderstandable . 
   i 'm just going to have to assume here that not only do you not know much about international law , that you also do n't know much about law or legal systems generally . 
  well i did study me some german law , but what do i know . 
  however i do admit that i just assumed your ratification laws would be just as sensible as ours '' \u00a7 1 treaty is herby ratified and law . '' . 
   i am more than happy for germany to have a different legal and constitutional system from the uk , it strikes me odd that you seem to be so butthurt about the british system . 
  i do n't care much about their system , but in general common law is weird and should have been replaced many years ago . 
   as a technical matter , we bound by the convention until we pull out of it . 
  however , as a matter of reality and politics , this will have no legal consequence . 
  true , but unfortunate . 
   separately , my understanding is that the uk will not be pulling out of the convention , but simply pulling out of the jurisidiction of the strasbourg court , as long as the uk is a signatory the strasbourg court will believe in it 's own jurisdiction over the uk . 
   and allowing the uk parliament to legislate in contravention of judgments of strasbourg . 
  if by `` allowing '' you mean `` in defiance of international law it agreed to and is technically bound to '' . 
  other british guys are telling the story differently . 
   the ratification of a treaty by the uk does not give that law effect in the uk . 
   [ sign or give formal consent to ( a treaty , contract , or agreement ) , making it officially valid  ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ratify?q=ratification#ratify__12 )  [ ratification is a principal 's approval of an act of its agent where the agent lacked authority to legally bind the principal . 
  [ clarification needed ] ratification defines the international act ** whereby a state indicates its consent to be bound to a treaty ** if the parties intended to show their consent by such an act . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratification ) the uk * did * ratify that treaty . 
   it might interest you to know that the uk has a ` dualist ' approach to international law . 
  the ratification of a treaty by the uk does not give that law effect in the uk . 
  it has to be legislated for specifically by the uk parliament for it to take effect . 
  ( some other countries have different systems whereby the ratification of a treaty automatically incorporates the law into domestic law . 
  these systems are known as ` monist ' systems . ), 
  well , it 's weird that british ratification is pointless and that they would bother with that because it would be much easier to just let the treaty be law on its own . 
  it 's completely superfluous to make another law for that . 
  they are still bound by the convention until they leave . 
   so , yes , the fact that the uk has signed up to a treaty does not mean that the treaty is applicable in the uk - that only happens if the parliament has passed uk legislation making it applicable . 
  without such enacting legislation you can not avail of the law/rights enshrined in the treaty in a uk court . 
  by `` signed that treaty '' i meant `` ratified it in parliament '' , which it did . 
   after all , whenever someone successfully applies to the echr , the success necessarily involves a breach of the convention by a country which is party to it , which therefore happens regularly without countries being considered no longer party to the convention . 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  when a new country signs the treaty nothing is broken anywhere . 
  [ you and your family members might be required to report your presence within a reasonable period of time after arrival . 
  this allows the public authorities of the host eu country to be fully aware of population movements in their territory . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/citizenship/docs/guide_free_movement_low.pdf ) it depends on the country you moved to , most do require it .
