  i 'll forgive because this rule is n't widely known . 
  yeah , that 's not true . 
  it 's an international treaty that is international law and once ratified is law in the uk . 
  it 's a fair assumption and easily proven . 
  how is that possible with parliaments supposedly unchecked sovereignty ? 
  nope . 
  echr is for the european convention on human rights , ecj is for the * eu charter * on human rights . 
  different treaties , different courts . 
  it 's not binding * if you are comfortable ignoring international law * . 
  that last part is important . 
  that 's not true . 
  your parliament of 1949 signed that convention , it ** is ** law in the uk and your current parliament can certainly leave the convention , but it can not have it both ways . 
  and until it does leave , the complete conevntion will stay law . 
   all public singing even when just children are gathering must me registered at the gema only when you can not prove that you are only singing songs that are in the public domain . 
  but then it 's a problem with your own courts , not with either the convention nor the european court . 
  just think about when westminster makes a law * torture is now okay whenever the police wants to . 
  your british courts could n't override that because you do n't have a constitution , without the convention and the strasbourg court your country could be torturing whomever it wanted . 
  apparently it is , as evidenced by camerons plans . 
  but i learned more about this issue . 
  the hra 1998 only requires british courts to take the convention in consideration when deciding , removal of it would only remove that requirement . 
  the convention would still stay in effect because the uk is still a signatory to the convention and the echr in strasbourg would still have the final decision . 
  technically you already have a residency permit , you have to get one of those whenever you permanently move to another eu country . 
  it 's very likely those will stay valid . 
  was that an actual decision of the strasbourg court or one from a british court ont he basis of the convention ? 
   rather than unelected judges in strasbourg . 
  you do n't know what you are talking about . 
   [ the judges are elected by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe from lists of three candidates proposed by each state . 
  they are elected for a non-renewable term of nine years . 
  although judges are elected in respect of a state , they hear cases as individuals and do not represent that state . 
  they are totally independent and can not engage in any activity that would be incompatible with their duty of independence and impartiality . 
  ] ( http://www.echr.coe.int/pages/home.aspx?p=court/judges ), 
   new zealand i do n't know , i have heard they let the fbi raid houses whenever they want to without due process . 
  of course there is . 
  if your country violates human rights it would be unlikely that your courts remedy that , especially if they are bound to your own laws . 
  [ the council of europe ( coe ; french : conseil de l'europe ) is an international organization promoting co-operation between european countries in the areas of legal standards , human rights , democratic development , the rule of law and cultural co-operation . 
  it was founded in 1949 and has 47 member states with 820 million citizens . 
  the organization is an independent body , and is not controlled by the european union , which is a separate organization it is sometimes confused with . 
  unlike european union and eurasian economic union , the council of europe can not make binding laws . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ), 
   but then nobody would be required to be a signatory of it , which the uk has to be whilst it remains in the eu . 
  actually no . 
  the * council of europe * , which is not affiliated with the eu in any way , demands that its members sign the convention on human rights , the eu does n't . 
   you ca n't uncouple them when echr membership is a pre-requisite to become ( and stay as ) an eu member state . 
  technically not true . 
   that is n't completely correct . 
  under the lisbon treaty the eu is bound to become a signatory to the echr . 
  in which case the eu signed the echr , so what ? 
  that makes the eu ** a member ** just the same as the uk . 
    that is unless you believe it 's right to criminalize homosexuality or torture detainees . 
   the job of a court is not to do `` what i believe is right '' . 
  it is to judge according to the law . 
  the european convention of human rights ** is ** law in the uk . 
  the treaty was ratified in 1949 and that 's it . 
  and that wo n't even change when the human rights act of 1998 will be repealed . 
   it would n't mean basic rights will be abolished but that rights such as th rights of prisoners to vote will be decided in britain and not brussels the uk is still technically bound to the same human rights as declared in the convention it ratified ... 
   it just allows uk courts to enforce them , rather than making people go to the echr in strasbourg . 
  ah , that makes sense . 
  so then everyone will just appeal to strasbourg for their judgements , thereby greatly increasing caseload related to the uk . 
  i do n't understand why someone would want that . 
  one can not appeal to the ecj for human rights violations , only for eu treaty violations . 
  there might be human rights not included in the eu treaties . 
  so you do n't have a constitution , gotcha . 
   but the principle argument seems to be that british courts should have the final say and not european ones . 
  that a multinational court has final say in human rights cases is kinda the entire point of that convention . 
   human rights act 1998 has nothing to do with most employment , only applies to public bodies . 
  so if you work in the private sector you are n't covered by the human rights act 1998 . 
  it appears you missed something , from the hra 1998 :  a court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a convention right must take into account any -- judgment , decision , declaration or advisory opinion of the european court of human rights , opinion of the commission given in a report adopted under article 31 of the convention , etc. 
  etc. , so this act makes the echr part of uk law apparently ? 
  did the uk never ratify the treaty ? 
   also as an eu member the government is still bound to the european court of human rights , you would have to appeal it in strasbourg and not the uk rather than both . 
  it would appear that you are confusing the european court of human rights ( created by the european convention on human rights and part of the council of europe ) with the european court of justice , a court made by the eu treaties and part of the eu . 
  if by `` has the power '' you mean `` has the power to ignore the treaty it 's bound to by international law '' , then ... yeah , sure . 
  edit : i just found out that this act of 1998 apparently makes the echr law in the uk ? 
  did uk never ratify the treaty ? 
   the main idea in repealing the human rights act is to make it so british courts have the final say and not the european court of human rights . 
  coincidently this is also the main problem with that idea . 
   i doubt this will affect eu policies like the working time directive and other employment rights of course it wo n't , as long as we are talking about eu directives . 
  what do you want to know ? 
   minus the high incidence of legal insurance . 
  that 's just logical , although it does n't pay any in case you win . 
  should the judgement then be unenforceable you are in a bit of a problem . 
  ah , i did n't know the russians like stalin , thanks . 
  i got that , yes . 
  but why would he ask that , does n't he know hitler ? 
  i do n't understand , would someone please explain ? 
  should i be surprised by stalin burning in hell ? 
  haha , yeah sure , a dane wo n't come to buy cheap beer in germany because of a $ 60/yr toll . 
  you are very funny . 
  but seriously , the autobahn toll sucks . 
  yup , that seems pretty similar . 
  why ? 
  that seems pretty sensible . 
   we do n't have any clearly defined poverty line in denmark you do n't have basic welfare for those who never worked a day in their life ? 
   always read the fine print : the graph is for single parents with 2 children . 
  it 's already a pretty rare case , and does n't even seem to account for social benefits that are available in most of those countries to single parents , especially with multiple kids . 
  it definitely includes welfare , otherwise the numbers would be much higher . 
  it has to , $ 1k a month in germany still entitles one to lots of welfare in this case . 
  base allowance for an adult is about $ 310 , childs are less , about $ 150 each i think , plus rent of about $ 530 for a grand total of $ 1,140 . 
  as an incentive to get work you do n't get all the money you worked for deducted from the $ 1,140 you are entitled to , so if the lone parent works 28 hours it 's around $ 1,350 net per month . 
  and yet you need 50 hours in the usa .
