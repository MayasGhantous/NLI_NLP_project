  in germany several ( dozens ) union contracts are made to apply universally by decree/law . 
   that 's bad because naturally they 're not representative at all . 
  but they are representatives . 
  of the constituencies that voted them in office . 
  every candidate who won his constituency ( half of the seats of the bundestag ) gets to keep his seat , even if his party only managed to win this one seat . 
  if the party manages to win at least 3 districts the 5 % rule does not apply to the party and they get all the other seats they would n't have gotten otherwise . 
  no , it does n't . 
  half of the board of directors are elected representatives of the workers , not all of which are members of the same union . 
  that 's it . 
  the board has not many functions : - ~ ~ elects ceo/fires ceo ~ ~ actually not true . 
  - checks that ceo is doing a fine job - has to sign off on contracts above a certain amount . 
   vw actually did manage to unionize in tennessee , though it is a very strange ( at least in the us ) situation as they only represent a minority of workers . 
  ( last i heard . ), 
  yeah , you can not force employees to join unions . 
   so if it was a normal situation where management did n't want to recognize the union the probably would n't have to , but since it was managements idea in the first place . . 
  i believe it was the idea of vws worldwide-workers-council president . 
  vw just could n't say no . 
   but germany-style work councils are illegal in the us , since they are effectively company-managed unions which are n't allowed . 
  this gives a false representation of actual german work-councils . 
  what vw would have had installed in the usa would have been a company-managed union , because they do n't have actual worker-councils . 
  are they ? 
  well , does your federal government spy on california ? 
  never mind , they probably do ... 
   or more realistically buy from them . 
  but they would make profit then , why waste money ? 
   so you think they wo n't record everything , just to have black box data ? 
  even if they would do that , of course only with permission of the owner , they would n't need a constant connection . 
   i like how people are fine with the idea of self driving cars which will need to always be connected to the internet they do n't need that . 
   tell that to 10s milions of people in europe who want to have means to get to their work and still have way to pay for their food on table it 's called : a bus . 
   and we are not talking about this only just year or two ago eu introduced mendatory abs and traction controll on all new cars . 
  only two years ? 
  i would have assumed those were mandatory since at least 2005ish or so ? 
  do n't you mean they made esp mandatory ? 
  shit happens . 
  recruits learn sailing and command structure on that . 
  and that they have to rely on their comrades i guess . 
  seriously ? 
  that 's such an american thing to do , arming their sailing school ship . 
  since when do you care about holstein ? 
  ah , yes , it 's a rise of $ 200m per year . 
  i mixed that up , but the point still stands . 
  do you even pay any taxes ? 
  holy shit you 're dumb . 
  that is $ 200m per year ** for the whole parliament including everything . 
  i would n't think so , those customes are a specifically spain only custom . 
   we ( until recently ) banned gmo for protectionist reasons i.e. 
  we did n't want a us seed company being a huge supplier of seeds , making our food industry vulnerable to foreign influence . 
  sure , that 's also a valid reason . 
   the safety of gm food has been established for years and the global scientific consensus is pretty clear on the matter , apparently that 's not correct . 
   if some activity like growing and selling gmos poses no harm to anyone else then state should have no right to intevene . 
  so where is your proof that gmos * do not pose harm * . 
  like actual factual proof of them being * 100 % safe * . 
  do n't have that ? 
  come back when you do . 
  the burden of proof is on * you * , not on us . 
  the americas are quite different from us europeans . 
  we like to * not allow * things that are not * proven safe * . 
  the usa waits until several people died and then , maybe , bans what killed them . 
  you need to think for a second at least , those 751 people represent us 500 million people . 
  a parliament for 500 million people for ** only $ 200m per year ** , is a bargain . 
   do you also support throwing $ 100 million at buying them booze because `` since they represent 500 million people , it 's a bargain '' ? 
  sure , why not , still a bargain . 
   it 's about a billion euros for 751 people ** over five years , so that is $ 200 million per year ** . 
  and they represent over 500 million people . 
  ** that 's a bargain ** . 
  and still they manage to be much more sane than national parliaments , probably because no one looks at them directly that much . 
  dear god , it 's $ 200 million per year for over 500 million people . 
  it 's absolutely irrelevant . 
  dear god , it 's $ 200 million per year for over 500 million people . 
  it 's absolutely irrelevant . 
   because it 's the lingua franca do you realize that this expression refers to actual french being the actual lingua france ? 
  you kinda made my point . 
  again , you are making no sense . 
  all languages of all countries are equally valid in the european parliament . 
  if you would only want one , then why english ? 
  why not german ? 
  or french ? 
  that is exactly why the treaties clearly made all languages equal . 
  you are making absolutely no sense , $ 200 million per year for a parliament of over 500 million people is a bargain . 
   my bad , i worded that badly . 
  it is indeed 5 years as spelled out in the article . 
  still , it is a billion euro increase over five years which is quite a bit all things considered . 
  no , it 's not . 
  the parliament ** costs ** one billion over five years . 
  a billion ? 
  how many meps do we have ? 
  about 1,000 ? 
  so that 's a rise of ** 18 million euros per year ** . 
  who cares ? 
  i miss the filur of my childhood . 
  sure , why not ? 
  what does it matter how they get here ? 
  actually in german law you can only ask for asylum on german ground . 
  yeah , i actually noticed that myself some time later but could n't be bothered to change it . 
  we do n't understand the point of your question , how do you think it would be different ? 
   his concept could be expanded such that asylum seekers can apply at the embassies of the country they want to go to . 
  that might be difficult in their home countries , otherwise they would n't need asylum . 
  i have no idea and do n't really care , but asylum is a human right , we can not abolish it . 
  so your solution is `` get rid of asylum right . '' ? 
  wher do you people come from ?
