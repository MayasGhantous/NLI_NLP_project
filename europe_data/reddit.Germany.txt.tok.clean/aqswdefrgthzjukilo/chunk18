  passing a b1 exam at age 18 does n't mean that those 18 year olds can actually hold a conversation , or that they remember anything at age 28 . 
   note 1 : quebec waiters can have a salary under the minimum wage legally because the system expects them to get tips , creating a circular problem where they need that tip to compensate . 
  do they ? 
  i thought canadians did n't allow that like most american states . 
  i did tip , though . 
  your credit card machines are pretty good at remembering one about that . 
  only as long as you keep receiving a swiss salary . 
  for example he `` forgot '' a public transport ticket for barcelona . 
  and the commute from barcelona takes at least three hours each direction instead of only one ... 
  is coat check free in canada ? 
  in germany they charge either $ .5 or $ 1 , so no tip . 
   previously i had traveled with a train from copenhagen to germany just via land . 
  both options still exist . 
  trains from copenhagen to hamburg either go by ferry at r\u00f6dby / puttgarden or use the bridge/tunnel to jutland and then drive south via flensborg . 
  that looks delicious , we have those too , but call them `` rouladen '' . 
  while funny i have to point out it 's the [ lusation neisse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lusatian_neisse ) , [ the border river between germany and poland . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/oder-neisse_line_between_germany_and_poland.jpg ), 
  that ambassador better cleared that with his the foreign ministry before writing the letter ... 
  not sure about that because i have n't had a chance to read the law . 
  but we do have a gender quota on our workers councils ( the ones that every company has to have ) and in that case the law is gender neutral . 
  nobody ever assumes that there just are n't enough qualified women to hire . 
  or women that actually want those jobs . 
   we do . 
  the `` problem '' is that speaking mumble-free seems posh or uppity , which has been considered super uncool for a few decades now . 
  maybe it will swing in the other direction some time in the future . 
  anyway , the point is just that it 's a stylistic choice rather than an intrinsic trait . 
  it just makes it very difficult to learn danish because even if we do , we would n't be able to understand you . 
    kamel\u00e5s\u00e5  i 'm honestly getting a little tired of that video . 
  every . 
  single . 
  thread . 
  disclaimer : too lazy for proper / o. 
  i actually do n't know if i ever heard flemish . 
  it 's actually what we say about danish , too . 
  that it 's low german with a hot potato . 
  german wikipedia tells us that he spoke english in the german dubbing . 
  oktober 1973 ) . 
  as a foreigner with a remedial understanding of danish i have to say : you guys sure mumble bad , all the time . 
  is it appropriate to link kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 again ? 
  intesting , even when one agrees with you you keep being an idiot . 
  neo-liberals are idiots , just as much as varoufakis . 
  i have no idea . 
  but it 's not . 
  poland actually did absolutely nothing . 
  ** a polish court ** decided that the extradition request from the usa was fundamentally flawed . 
  but we do n't even know if he actually is a child rapist , he plead guilty to `` unlawful sex with a minor '' because he as threatened with decades in a federal pound-me-in-the-ass-prison . 
  that does n't actually prove his guilt . 
  there was no trial . 
  there were no facts presented , no jury or judge decided on his guilt . 
  somehow he managed to not commit a similar crime for fourty years , so clearly he is no danger to society . 
  one wonders what the usa is actually trying to accomplish here . 
  i 'm quite amazed by your idiocy . 
    if anyone would actually say that then we would n't be doing it !, 
   who is `` we '' ? 
  you and an imaginary group of like-minded imbeciles ? 
  look , you ca n't even read . 
  `` we '' clearly refers to `` us germans '' . 
   seehofer is an idiot . 
  as far i know he is pretty much the only one actually wanting to close the borders , so clearly he is the only sane politian left . 
   merkel is fully aware of the frictions and issues this causes , but apparently she is willing to make this step . 
  that 's really near to treason actually . 
  we can not afford this , it 's much too expensive . 
  those people have absolutely no right to be in germany . 
  why should we take another million welfare recipients ? 
  do * you * have too much money ? 
  do you even pay any taxes ? 
  probably not , you are too busy handing out clothes and whatnot to illegal immigrants in train stations . 
  us taxpayers are just complacent until now because we can not be bothered by every shit that 's happening , but it 's really getting out of hand . 
  they are now actually housing them in containers in the middle of our cities , driving down property prices quite significantly too . 
  one really wonders why they would do that , it 's basically bait probably . 
  you can not even walk around your own town anymore without fear . 
  many poor people with too much time on their hands will obviously create more crime and who will pay for the extra policemen ? 
  this is going to cost many tens of billions . 
   you do n't clean up anything , i . . what the hell ? 
  what 's dirty ? 
  who made it dirty and why should i clean it up ? 
   the greek crisis beautifully demonstrates how all those newspapers you listed pulled in the same direction . 
  some were faux-critical of merkel , but even those never questioned the concept of austerity . 
  not fucking once . 
  even those portrayed varoufakis as a crazy , childish lunatic . 
  that 's because varoufakik objectively * is * a crazy , childish lunatic . 
  facts are facts . 
  the refugee crisis , or more accurately the illegal immigrant crisis , gets far less coverage than it should . 
  and most of it focuses on feel-good news . 
   sorry but i ca n't take you seriously if you say shit like this . 
  nobody ever claimed this situation was going to be easy . 
  sorry , but most actually do say shit like that . 
   no one , even the hardest pro asyl folks call this immigrant-crisis a problem for the next century ... 
  if anyone would actually say that then we would n't be doing it !, 
  fact of the matter is that seehofer and most mayors warn merkel for months now , but she still does n't get it and we have to clean up her mess . 
   what about all the polish girls that are now subject to having a convicted drugger and child rapist living amongst them ? 
  what about your country having you living in it ? 
  you are obviously quite crazy , maybe something should be done about that ? 
  he also did not commit any crime during the last fourty years so nothing would be achieved by imprisoning him . 
   why must some people always argue that it is ok for governments to compromise their free citizens safety over the safety of foreign nationals and criminals ? 
  dude , he ** is polish ** . 
  did you read what i just wrote ? 
  no , you did not . 
  poland is not protecting a child rapist . 
  they would n't extradite him to the usa and that 's absolutely normal .
