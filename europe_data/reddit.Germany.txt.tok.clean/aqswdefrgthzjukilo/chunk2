  and the american service network surely is much much smaller than gms . 
   the only thing that differentiates the car companies is their ice ( internal combustion engine ) . 
  til an audi is totally the same as a skoda . 
   these legacy , 100 + year technologies . 
  like electric motors and batteries ? 
   now think how popular the model 3 would be compared to the crappy prius or half-assed e-golf attempts from vw . 
  as if a golf was n't a hundred times better than some crappy car made in usa . 
  outselling ** does not equal ** `` ripping into sales '' . 
   which just happens to be ripping into sales of high end sedans . 
  bullshit , only eco-conscious types are buying teslas . 
  they would never have bought a 7-series instead . 
  everyone does . 
  mercedes makes s - and e-class hybrids and has a working hydrogen fuel cell cars that could get into production on some years notice . 
  if it were profitable . 
  bmw could built you a car that burns hydrogen in its ice if you wanted to buy it . 
  tesla is exploiting a very tiny niche market to not make a profit . 
  they do it so they can sell that company to some idiot who will buy it someday . 
   some new world-changing technology appear ~ ~ s ~ ~ ** ed over a hundred years ago ** , ftfy  `` new type of product '' this just in , breaking new product : ** the car ** . 
   their ev cars will always be considered `` second rate '' compared to tesla and other serious ev makers , as they should be , because they 're not serious about them . 
  you muskfanboys are so delusional it is n't even funny . 
  american conviction rate does n't prove that the convicted persons were actually guilty . 
  90 + % of them accepted a plea deal for fear of getting 50 years . 
  oh i 'm just some douche who studied four semesters of law before being too lazy and changing careers who found out last year that the fernuni hagen semesterbeitrag is only $ 50 and that includes beck online , juris and lots of other interesting stuff . 
  interesting case indeed , maybe she can prevail on \u00a7 574 ? 
  but i guess that would be rather hard and as we agreed she will probably settle once she has found another apartment . 
  you are lucky i have access to beck online , because i could n't find it on google . 
  anyhow , apparently it 's not as clearcut as i thought . 
  however , the verdict is from 1980 and only from bayoblg , this might very well end differently . 
  and lastly , i would argue it 's much easier or reasonable to rent an apartment for refugees and not terminate this contract than to put these public rooms into another building where they would have had no connection to the other public rooms . 
  ms hannappel apparently agrees with you in beckok bgb/sonja hannappel bgb \u00a7 573 rn . 
  damn , this is gon na be expensive and take forever . 
  the tenant will probably settle once she finds another apartment . 
  a court approved eigenbarf for a city ? 
  citation please . 
  germany prevails on common sense . 
  our munipalities also can not declare bankruptcy . 
  because that 's idiotic . 
  that 's the cities problem . 
   this is about city-owned flats and the so-called `` eigenbedarfsregelung '' , which means that , if you rent out a flat to someone , you can terminate the contract with advance notice if you need the room ( s ) for yourself . 
  the problem is that this `` eigenbedarf '' only applies to actual people , not entities , so the entire thing is a bit wonky , legally speaking . 
  it 's not a problem , it 's downright illegal . 
  this case will be thrown out immediately if it ever reaches a court . 
  however that does n't mean they used a `` defeat device '' that might just mean the test does not accurately represented how cars are used in reality . 
  noone did find out for seven years , did they ? 
  yeah , totally . 
  vw will be bankrupt next week !!!, 
  ! 1111 you guys are , well , not hilarious , i kinda pity you . 
   show me the vw tdi that costs more than $ 37,500 . 
  it 'd be hard to show you one that costs less than that in germany , but they only sell cheap shit specially engineered for the american market in the usa . 
  but it 's quite irrelevant to any of this anyway . 
   dude are you fucking serious ?!, 
  ** yes , of course ** . 
   that is the president of volkswagen america . 
  what more do you need ? 
  have n't seen that until now , have i ? 
  that 's still not proof that what they did was * actually illegal * . 
  it might be deceptive , but it might be legal . 
  we will see after the court case is through in some years time . 
  they are in damage-control-mode and apologize because of that , that 's standard practice . 
   and here 's the article i quoted if you 're too fucking daft to google that shit yourself . 
  you have to prove your own claims , that 's not my job . 
  but that article does n't actually quote anyone from vw saying they did something that was actually illegal . 
  only that they estimate it will cost them $ 6.5 b total . 
   well buy all you can then , no one is stopping you , we have a saying here `` put your money where your mouth is '' . 
  no reason to argue with me if you think i 'm wrong , especially if you 're not even going to raise interesting points . 
  oh , i will buy some . 
  and i will make a very nice profit off that . 
  and you do forget that for a transaction to take place there alwas has to be a seller ** and ** a buyer . 
  so lots of people bought at these prices . 
   uhhh no they have grounds to levy fines equal to the value of every vehicle sold on the company . 
  nope , the maximum is $ 37,500 per vehicle . 
   what is unreasonable about requesting the maximum fines when the environmental protection act has been intentionally violated for the last seven years . 
  and when volkswagen spent the last years lying to the epa and only came clean when they outright refused to allow import of their newest models into the country . 
  again : we only have the epas word for the alleged confession of vw . 
   dude i know you 're probably really bummed that your granny and grandpappy are n't going to be able to retire yet . 
  but the mother fucking ceo of the mother fucking company has admitted to what happened . 
  where did he do that ? 
  nobody linked an article with him saying that . 
   hmm well the american economy is 22 % of the world economy . 
  so i guess what i believe that in economic terms the united states market is about as important as more than 1/5th of the world economy . 
  you conflate `` the american economy '' with `` vw can sell 22 % of all its cars in america '' . 
  that 's obviously not possible . 
   that important enough for you ? 
  ** it 's not important to vw which was the entire point we are talking about ** . 
   so if that 's all it 's going to cost they 're an insane bargain right now . 
  they are . 
   they have a legal right to purse a 18 billion dollar fine , for a blatant crime that vw has already admitted to . 
  they can impose ** reasonable ** fines of upto that amount . 
  any amount will be fought in court and we only have the epas word for vws confession . 
   add to all that the fact that volkswagen is arguing from a shitty , shitty position . 
  this was n't a mistake it was a willful intent to violate environmental protection law , and to defraud customers . 
  no one presented proof of that . 
   they need the american market a lot more than the american market needs volkswagen . 
  that sentence in itself might be true , but the american market is n't nearly as important as you believe . 
   fines - in the u.s. alone , and just in regard to the epa you 're looking at potential fines of 18 billion . 
  they will ** maybe ** pay $ 2billion . 
   settlements - they 're going to get sued big time , class action lawsuits looking for a big percentage of the vehicles original values . 
  and they 're in a shitty position to defend themselves because they knew that they were defrauding the customers . 
  maybe another $ 2b , no more . 
  blame ?
