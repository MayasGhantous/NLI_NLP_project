  i meant the one from solna to sickla udde and the other one going to the vasa museum island . 
  and i actually had to leave my tram going to globen from solnda at some station and walk 50m to enter another tram that would continue in the same direction . 
   the tram routes are longer with fewer stops and fewer trains . 
  it would n't be viable to have metro to liding\u00f6 or roslagen , the population density is just too low . 
  yeah , no problem . 
  i was mainly annoyed by the long walk between metro lines at t-centralen and that other one where the metro stops that does n't stop at centralen ? 
  my memory is hazy , but i 'm sure something required me to walk quite a while outside . 
  was very cold . 
  that 's good news , for stockholmers . 
  and i believe the blue line does n't connect to the other two lines as well . 
  you have to walk like 500m between their stations . 
  it 's kinda weird , though , that your metro and your two ( * different !, 
  * ) trams do n't connect . 
  any idea why ? 
   1 ) do you think that ` being prosecuted in home country ' is a sufficient reason for not being able to work and claiming welfare ? 
  persecuted . 
  and those get asylum and therefore a speedy work permit . 
   2 ) do you think that majority of these refugees are prosecuted ? 
  of course not , but we , and you probably too , signed the treaty on war refugees . 
   but because my city has such high taxes it nets an additional 10 % to my total tax burden . 
  that would mean your hebesatz ( factor to business tax ) is at least 650 % . 
  is that possible ? 
  damn ... apparently berlins is at 810 % now . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  but still better than before 2008 when you could n't deduct 380 % of cour federal income tax . 
   the syrians , as war refugees , technically are asylum seekers -- but they have a 100 % chance of getting asylum , due to fleeing from war . 
  no , they are * not * asylum seekers and they * have absolutely no chance of getting asylum * . 
  we allow them in and feed them and allow them to work because of the treaty we signed about war refugees , but * asylum * is only for the politically persecuted . 
  syrians do n't qualify . 
  they are war refugees . 
  it 's a different thing . 
  some might argue that is precisely what trump intends to do , because he wants the democrat candidate to win . 
  being president is a lot of work , i do n't believe he actually wants to do that . 
  2-19 were changed quite a few times . 
  if that would n't be possible then article 79 would n't make any sense . 
  obviously there are limits , but this is also obviously quite moot . 
  syrians do not apply for asylum . 
  they are war refugees . 
  articles 2-19 were change quite a few times . 
  but we do n't actually need to change anything , syrians * do not get asylum * . 
  they are fleeing from war , that 's not a reason for asylum . 
  sure , a fence is perfectly legal . 
  but we can not deport people to hungary and we can not deport people that are supposed to be deported to hungary to austria instead . 
  that clause ** only ** applies to articles 1 ** and ** 20 , not to any other articles . 
  no , they are not . 
  articles 1 and 20 are protected by that clause . 
  i #d say he has a good chance because he is polarizing . 
  if half hates him and half likes him he will win . 
   this article also has a good discussion of trump and why ( hopefully imo ) he probably wo n't get the nomination . 
  he might not care if he gets nominated . 
  anyone with several billion dollars can become president . 
  give me enough money and * i * will become president in 2020 . 
  after i had enough time to pass an amendment about that natural citizen thing . 
   there can be no upper limit as the consitution prevents that . 
  that 's not true . 
  the syrians are not requesting asylum and they could n't , because they are n't fleeing for political reasons . 
  they are `` just '' fleeing from war , nothing else . 
  the constitution does n't apply to them . 
  the court actually decided that hungary is no longer safe to deport back to . 
  at least in one case . 
  that kinda started the whole problem . 
  syrians could n't even request asylum if they come by plane , they are n't here for political reasons . 
  in fact they do n't request asylum . 
  that clause only applies to articles 1 and 20 , not to any other articles . 
  that clause only applies to articles 1 and 20 , not to any other articles . 
  that only applies to articles 1 ** and ** 20 . 
  not to the articles 2 to 19 . 
   courts decided that other nations cant take any more migrants because they are full . 
  was n't there just the one decision that prevents us from deporting them to hungary ? 
  that does n't matter if they can not make it to germany in the first place . 
   so you relocate the problem to austria or more likely greece , where most refugees enter the eu for the first time ? 
  that would n't help much , countries of that size just could n't handle it . 
  it would help * us * . 
   merkel does n't prevent it , our constitution prevents it but our court never had a problem with us requiring asylum seekers to get to us first . 
  if we were to build a fence they could n't get to us anymore and thus would be unable to request asylum . 
   of course you could also argue that germany should not take any refugees because they will always come through a safe third country as is dictated by geography that 's precisely the point , if the other countries would be doing their job we would n't have to take anyone in . 
  it 's not violating the constitution to prevent asylum seekers to come to germany . 
  they do n't get to apply before they are on our ground . 
  your comment contradicts itself . 
  of course it does , the teacher does the same each and every day . 
  as does the office clerk , which people do want to be and what does n't require any higher education in sensible countries . 
  fact is : german kids do n't want to work manually . 
  nope . 
   there are other businesses besides restaurants !, 
  like what ? 
  but carpenter or electrician or teacher or hairdresser or baker is ? 
  sometimes they get to put wallpaper on before painting that . 
  i do n't get your point , what are you trying to say ? 
  every job does what it does for its whole life . 
   entrepreneurship is probably the best route for these guys doing what ? 
  they can not be painters , electricians or lots of other skilled trades . 
  that leaves what our italian , greek and turkish friends did : restaurants . 
  2 out of 3 restaurants fail and who wants to eat syrian ? 
  no , it 's true . 
  the stories really are about those poor refugees attacking each other because * we do n't treat them well enough * . 
  do n't worry , the french are far easier to conquer . 
  you should look into how fucking hard it is for a german to get an australian work visa and then reflect on that . 
  yeah , about that :  the e-3 visa is a united states visa for which only citizens of australia are eligible . 
  [ 1 ] it was created by an act of the united states congress as a result of the australia-united states free trade agreement ( ausfta ) , although it is not formally a part of the ausfta . 
  actually not true , for example germany has a serious shortage of painters at the moment .
