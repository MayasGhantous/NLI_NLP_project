  shooting bean bags at illegal immigrants ** is ** the best . 
  i really wonder why you do n't ? 
  your police has no problem gunning down black people every day , so why stop at mexicans ? 
  finally . 
  actually there was a study that found that smokers are actually cheaper because they die earlier and that saves on pensions . 
  maybe not exactly cheaper , but it 's more or less the same cost . 
   which is essentially the same . 
  but it 's not the same . 
  as i told you , it is not on the list of reasons for asylum . 
  as i told you . 
  ** war ** is not on the list of reasons for ** asylum ** . 
   `` race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion '' exactly , that is my point . 
  war is not on that list . 
  i feel like we did that already a couple of days ago , did n't we ? 
  i distinctly remember talking to an interpreter from the eu ... 
   we ( as in the countries in the eu ) do , do we really ? 
  when did that start ? 
  i 'm rather sure we only offer asylum if you are persecuted for your race or religion and such . 
  yes , exactly . 
  they do n't get to move through , they have no right to do that . 
  of course we would prefer that , but ** i ** would n't make such idiotic entitled signs . 
  i would know i have no right to be in sweden . 
   i like how you think of danger as in dangerous/not dangerous when there 's clearly different levels of dangers . 
  sure there are . 
  but at some point there is a line between `` not dangerous enough to get asylum '' and `` dangerious enough to get asylum . '' . 
  if you family can stay behind than you lived in a `` not dangerous * enough * . . '' place and therefore obviously have no right to asylum . 
  they are not allowed to flee to places that do that . 
  and there are homeless people in germany , what 's your point ? 
  not a single person in germany ** has ** to be homeless therefore all that are homeless in germany are homeless by their own choice . 
  i do n't believe it 's different in sweden . 
  it does n't make sense if that family is in * serious danger back home * . 
  but in reality that family is safe and sound in turkey and the men are economic migrants from there to sweden . 
  poor people in sweden are not struggling . 
  obviously they live in poor areas , but that 's still a lot better than living in syria or wherever they are from . 
  oh i would probably do the same as them . 
  but we should n't yell at the hungarians for keeping them out . 
  not for immigrants . 
  but they do n't have a * right * to do that . 
  they have a right to shelter and food and basic healthcare . 
  in turkey . 
  because of that and your username i 'm gon na assume you are finnish . 
   but there 's also the need to build a life where your kid can get education quickly , that 's not enough to claim asylum . 
  the obvious answer is `` yes , you do . '' . 
  you are not fleeing if your family is safing in turkey . 
  if they are fleeing from being persecuted they would have brought their women with them . 
  the fact that women stayed behing is clear proof that it is still very safe whereever the women are . 
    because these are fit young middle class looking men who are taking advantage of the situation to move to their preferred countries . 
   or fit young men that do n't risk rape and mugging as much as their wifes/daughters/sisters on a very perilous road . 
  i assumed they were fleeing from unbearable circumstances , clearly a perilous road would be much better than staying behind . 
  so obviously these young men are not refugees . 
  they do n't get to pick their country of refuge . 
  can it be solved with money ? 
  -  it 's economic . 
   we do owe them asylum from war , sure , but that can be in greece or poland or croatia . 
  there is no war there . 
  and do we really ? 
  anyone from any warzone can get asylum ? 
  that 's going to get expensive really quick . 
  i honestly never heard that we offer asylum to those living in countries at war , when did we start doing that ? 
  sure , but i kinda do understand . 
  once you started moving to europe , why stop in croatia if you can have sweden ? 
  it 's amazing how they actually believe they have a right to move to sweden . 
  and this is newsworthy ... why ? 
  they are lying . 
  or they might actually believe that * now * . 
  once they got a taste of our good live they wo n't be going back . 
    for crossing border without a visa . 
  still illegal for * asylum applicants * . 
   dna profiling takes months i thought that was only a matter of a week nowaday ? 
  i read something about that some months back . 
  but i obviously did n't expect them to be career-criminals like you describe . 
  to where they were assigned to stay . 
  actually i would at least put them in prison for a month or two ( the first time ) in their assigned country for crossing border without a visa . 
  but all our countries are better than syria , the refugees will have to be happy with whereever they get put . 
  force ? 
  how else ? 
  they will be deported everytime we catch one . 
  only ? 
  100k is very much . 
   since faymann could play big boy the last few weeks and criticise hungary in ever escalating ways , he now has the ability to show how it 's done . 
  so he will close austrias borders ? 
   bernadotte was elected partly because a large part of the swedish army , in view of future complications with russia , were in favour of electing a soldier , and partly because he was also personally popular , owing to the kindness he had shown to the swedish prisoners during the recent war with denmark . 
  [ 6 ] the matter was decided by one of the swedish courtiers , baron karl otto m\u00f6rner , who , entirely on his own initiative , offered the succession to the swedish crown to bernadotte . 
  bernadotte communicated m\u00f6rner 's offer to napoleon , who treated the whole affair as an absurdity . 
  the emperor did not support bernadotte but did not oppose him either and so bernadotte informed m\u00f6rner that he would not refuse the honour if he were elected . 
  although the swedish government , amazed at m\u00f6rner 's effrontery , at once placed him under arrest on his return to sweden , the candidature of bernadotte gradually gained favour and on 21 august 1810 [ 6 ] in \u00d6rebro , [ citation needed ] he was elected by the riksdag of the estates to be the new crown prince , [ 6 ] and was subsequently made generalissimus of the swedish armed forces by the king . 
  [ 9 ] one month later , on 26 september 1810 , he renounced the title of prince of ponte corvo .

  they are n't paved , are they ? 
  i know , that 's unfortunate . 
   anyone who comes to eu is given asylum no matter how many safe countries he went through . 
  that 's not true . 
  people from safe countries or those that came from safe countries are specifically exempt from asylum . 
   why do we allow them to chose eu we do n't ? 
   isntead of dozen of countries they had to went thought before they get to eu and then suddenly they can not chose germany ? 
  do you mean these new ones coming in right now ? 
  there are three million more of then in turkey , the turks really need a break right now . 
   they why they are allowed to come from safe countries in africa and middle east to eu ? 
  they are n't . 
   they have zero influence outside bavaria .
