  yeah , they only got 7.4 % in the last the federal election . 
  you are an idiot . 
   soon our fellow germans will also understands that these people have preferences like no other . 
  they preferences are irrelevant . 
  do n't worry , i support you . 
  yeah , this really is n't surprising . 
   ( bt plans to install g.fast dslams on the poles ) . 
  you still have poles ? 
   well we can argue semantics all day long , but to be fair , many of these circuits and headstations at least in the former west were planned and deployed many years before anyone even thought about ever using those for anything else but analog tv distribution how is that not obvious ? 
  but they already did invest many billions into upgrading them to internet , back in ye olde days there was only one head station for tens of thousands . 
  now there is maybe one for 100 or 500 customers . 
   thought about this wierd thing called the internet ( after all , we talk early eighties here ) . 
  they need to get their shit together though and fix that , yesterday . 
  that is exactly what i said . 
  well , except that `` fix it yesterday '' part , apparently they do n't * need * to do that . 
  people are buying their `` 100.000 internet ! '', 
  like crazy . 
   yeah ? 
  apart from the fact , that there are still not fiber connections available `` anywhere '' ... what the fuck are you talking about you idiot . 
  those outdoor-dslams you have seen all over town ... guess how they are connected ? 
  fiber !, 
  ** 1.2 gbps ** connection . 
  or simply order a ** 10gbps ** connection from them directly from your home to the de-cix . 
  [ vodafone also offers 1gbps ] ( https://www.vodafone.de/business/firmenkunden/telefonie-internet/internet-connect.html ) . 
  it 's a money issue , not an availability issue . 
   show me a link to a 1000mbps connection in germany !, 
  and i 'll order it !, 
  you can not afford it . 
   i do n't think anyone is doing `` sub loop unbundling '' either , where they install their own street cabinets instead of using bt 's . 
  that 's possible in germany . 
  we have a special list that decided on first-come-first-serve who gets to build vectoring into which cabinets . 
  but everyone has to rent out bitstream access to everyone else . 
   and it 's likely that they 're going to spend a lot of money on vdsl and then g.fast anyway , money that could have been spent once on ftth . 
  we need g.fast anyway , though . 
  i own apartment buildings and i wo n't be paying to install fiber into every apartment , so we still need something that gets 100 + mbps over pots wires from the fiber in the cellar . 
   oh , and in bt 's case they 've been doing ftth in areas that are not at all profitable , like 1 house per mile density . 
  it makes sense to use it instead of vdsl in that situation , but if that investment can be justified , so can ftth anywhere else . 
  ( as opposed to just telling them to get satellite , as other people have been told ) surely bt did that because they have a mandate to provide x mbps to everyone ? 
   it 's believed that the modems and cabinets can do it , they just need to turn it on when they feel like doing so , which being bt will probably be a long way away . 
  because in germany other providers can actually put their own equipment into the local exchanges ( net node once terminating aboutish 10k copper lines ) dtag is n't yet allowed to use vectoring in them , so those are stuck at 50mpbs vdsl , which is plenty of course . 
  so vectoring , as of now , is only available if you are connected to an outdoor-dslam . 
   we 've only just had impulse noise protection turned on - which did take my speed from 65 to about 75-80mbit . 
  that 's nice i guess . 
  but hopefully vectoring would allow them to offer 100 + mbit vdsl will probably be good enough , but i just think it 's stupid that they 're willing to use a much better technology when they feel like it ( even in unprofitable areas ) and give most users the cheaper , not futureproof one . 
  dtag says , and is probably correct , that ftth would cost several metric shit-tons of money . 
  and we do n't need it now , 50 or 100mbps seems quite enough , does n't it ? 
  this should be fine for several years . 
  i would n't call it a design flaw . 
  it 's only that way because kdg chose to spend less money which equals less head stations which results in more customers per cable tree . 
   1000mbps is just not available here yet . 
  even bill gates would n't get it in his private house . 
  he would have to build it on his own . 
  like i said : bullshit . 
  you can get whatever speed you want * anywhere * in germany . 
  you just have to pay the bill for the newly laid fiber . 
   if you 're close enough to the street cabinet and crosstalk and other factors are n't dragging it down . 
  we are actually now using a technology that reduces crosstalk significantly , dtag calls it `` vectoring '' . 
  thanks to that i and millions of other germans were able to get a 100/40 instead of 16/1 . 
  and 100/40 is plenty for at least a couple of years . 
  i would , but i 'd probably lose because sometimes karlsruhe goes too far . 
  well that 's very unfortunate that this was changed . 
  the police could still check a train full of syrians just because it 's a train full of syrians . 
   they do n't . 
  for fucks sake , or verdammtnochmal , i ** just ** told you that they do . 
  i have seen defendants convicted * because they did do that * . 
   police are checking for import , not export . 
  they are checking for * possession * . 
  border police ( maybe we should change the translation to treasury police , now that schengen was enacted a long ago , but it does n't change the fact ) is checking trains from hamburg to denmark all the time and there are always at least three police cars on the a7 waiting on the sides for whatever they are looking . 
   also , skin colour is a bad predictor . 
  totally , you are subscribed to the taz , are you ? 
   in bavaria , maybe , before the whole practice was abolished by federal law this january . 
  quit with your bavaria-bullshit . 
  this is n't any different in sh . 
  ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/asylvfg_1992/__56.html ) so okay , they are restricted to the state they live in and not the county , so what . 
   you 're confusing federal , or maybe bavarian , and sh police . 
  not sure what you are getting at . 
  sh police regulary checks dark-skinned people in trains travelling to denmark for drugs . 
  why they do this , you ask ? 
  because dark-skinned people in trains travelling to denmark have a higher chance of trying to smuggle drugs into denmark than fair-skinned people in trains travelling to denmark . 
   why ? 
  could be already-registered people on a field trip . 
  now if they had been wearing balaclavas ... german-registered asylum seekers are not allowed to leave their county ( kreis ) . 
  non-german-registered asylum seekers have no right to be anywhere in germany . 
   do you think the eu would be ok with herding refugees to camps by force , using riot guns and water cannons ? 
  yes , i do . 
   and the police can not use force to stop them from crossing the hungarian-austrian border . 
  of course it could . 
  they have no right to leave hungary . 
  but you are authorized to use force to register them . 
   they 're also allowed to not check ids , they are also allowed to check ids . 
   and we are not allowed to have systematic border controls ( all our land borders are on the inside , not outside , of schengen ) , we could suspend schengen for thirty days . 
   much less racial profiling . 
   checks actually have to be either a ) backed by something concrete looking syrian in a train with another two hundred syrian looking people seems pretty concrete to me . 
   i think they do not want to build refugee camps for 300000 people because that would be the second biggest city in the country the day it is finished . 
  of course they do n't ** want ** to do that , but that is what they are supposed to do . 
   hungary will not be a dumper depot for hundreds of thousands of migrants for months or years until their asylum status is determined . 
  why not ? 
  turkey has three * million * of them . 
   put into a broader context does this mean that they 're all supposed to be registered in greece and italy and not leave ? 
  yup .
