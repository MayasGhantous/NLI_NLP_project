  in germany there are no level-crossings if the track is good for more than 160kph . 
  however , that does n't mean one could n't get a truck on the track if one wanted to . 
  you will notice that i did n't say anything about if they are supposed to go home or if i have anything against them being here . 
  i merely explained to you an obvious fact : they do n't want to go home !, 
  the point is that both should be willing to go home in your mindset . 
  those syrians will be here for at least a decade , they wo n't want to go home . 
  and they did n't want to return anyway , because noone ever wants to live in syria . 
  and despite them * not * being in war , they did n't go home . 
   if you were raised in syria , listening to its music , eating its food , walking its streets , travelling its deserts , making friends there , having family there , then that place will always have a place deep inside your heart . 
  is that why the turks and greeks left ? 
  oh wait , they did n't . 
  yeah , because anyone would rather live in syria than austria . 
  yes , it means that . 
  we have to accept that . 
  nobody ever wanted to live in syria . 
  ** they do n't want to go home once the conflict ends . 
  not a single one of them * wants * to go back to syria . 
  see , that 's why you do n't get many requests . 
  [ it 's actually quite hard to immigrate into the usa . 
  of course not , how would the asylum seekers get to the usa ? 
  or do you accept asylum requests from people who are n't on your land ? 
  where do all of you people get the word `` stream '' ? 
  this is not about netflix , it 's about tv . 
  that 's the point of this article , they would have to . 
  this is exactly what would happen . 
  it would only get more expensive for poorer countries . 
   the common digital market says '' ** tv ** '' right there in the title . 
  also says `` broadcasting and cable '' in the article . 
  soooo ... 
  see , that 's why i 'm telling you that it is indeed a fact . 
   but it 's pretty damaging to write off all teenage girls who are questioning their sexuality as being attention-seekers or whatever because that happens sooo often , right ? 
  or just in about 10 % of all girls ? 
  i wonder why that may be . 
  only one can be normal . 
   yeah , default is a better way to describe it than ` normal ' . 
  using ` normal ' suggests that the opposite is ` abnormal ' and therefore weird , strange and sickly . 
  which it of course is n't . 
  it is abnormal . 
  the problem is that many people do n't understand that abnormal just means `` not normal '' . 
  it is a fact . 
  normal is really quite synonym to `` what most people are '' . 
  so , yes , there * is * normal sexuality . 
  and homosexuality * is * abnormal . 
  i guess that means that * all * female young british persons would like a threesome . 
   perhaps you should try reading it . 
  it is at odds with what you are saying . 
  it 's really not . 
  extraditions have nothing to do with trials , i never said they did . 
   not true , although it is common practice to require very high levels of proof . 
  at this point you are supposed to provide examples . 
   some nations refuse to extradite citizens and use that to claim jurisdiction over the crime . 
  but that is not the norm . 
  of course that is the norm . 
  extraditions requests exist to get ** your own ** citizens out of another country . 
  they are definitely not for getting citizens of another country out of that country , that is absolutely insane that you actually believe that . 
   it is much more difficult for a trial to take place that is based on physical evidence and witness testimony extraterritorially . 
  the difficulty is absolutely irrelevant . 
   i am not sure how many laws you 've read . 
  lots more than you . 
   not to mention that is not how jurisdiction works . 
  some countries that refuse to extradite will use that refusal to claim jurisdiction , but again that is not the norm . 
  again , the law reads `` he who murders will be punished '' . 
  simplified obviously , but you understood that already , after all you are a lawyer . 
  it 's absolutely irrelevant where that murder happened . 
   you dont have to believe me . 
  if you look through my history i was talking to other lawyers about starting their own firms a while back . 
  well then you should have an idea of how the law works . 
  or at least know that the american law you learned is * very * different from civil law . 
   your arrogance is getting in the way of facts . 
  iceland is an outlier . 
  and it certainly cant be said `` no '' countries extradite their own citizens . 
  no , iceland is absolutely the norm . 
  * you * need to provide examples for countries that do extradite their own citizens , because * i * can not prove a negative . 
  so ... when did the usa extradite those two dozen cia agents that have outstanding european arrest warrants against them ? 
   you should probably learn the material before you try teaching others . 
  you really should be thankful and try to learn a thing or two . 
   no it is not . 
  an extradition is the act of turning over an individual to the country where an alleged crime was committed . 
  yes , exactly . 
  that is what i said . 
  but * no * country extradites its own citizens . 
    the procedure by which a state or nation , upon receipt of a formal request by another state or nation , turns over to that second jurisdiction an individual charged with or convicted of a crime in that jurisdiction . 
   an extradition is not a trial . 
  i 'm glad that you learned this just now . 
    no country will extradite its own citizens  again , not true , although countries typically require fairly compelling evidence . 
  again : only the usa and uk will extradite their own citizens to each other . 
  and the eu within the eu under specific circumstances . 
  both are extreme exceptions . 
  but it 's also irrelevant , the whole purpose of a country is to protect it 's own citizens from foreign powers ( one the the very basic purposes at least ) and therefore no coutnry extradites its own citizens . 
  it kinda makes sense within the eu , but there were a great many constitutional challenges about that . 
  all of which were lost , sadly . 
  anyhow , it kinda makes sense , but for the uk to extradite its * own * citizens to the usa ? 
  that is absolutely disgusting , no matter what . 
   it is extremely relevant no . 
  the law is `` he who murders will be punished . '' . 
  it does n't matter * where * that one did murder . 
  if he murdered he will be punished . 
   you are the one who has no idea how this process works . 
  actually * i * am teaching you how it works . 
   i am a lawyer .
