  where a crime took place is extremely relevant . 
  you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  you are not a lawyer , quit trolling . 
  what the fuck is your problem ? 
  did the usa send over the two dozen cia agents or did it not ? 
  if it did n't then it obviously refused to extradite its own citizens . 
  dude , you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about . 
  if an icelandic citizens murders someone in the usa that icelandic citizen would be convicted ** in iceland ** and would be imprisoned in iceland . 
  that is ** exactly ** how all extraditions work . 
  no country will extradite its own citizens , that would be against the very basic purpose of a country . 
  with the exception of the disgusting usa-uk and eu treaties about extradition , but there are no others . 
  extraditions are always about getting ones own citizens or aliens from another country . 
   why , he did not break the law in iceland . 
  it 's absolutely irrelevant * where * that murder took place . 
   is not quite the same thing as just setting him free , is it ? 
  that sentence was for something else . 
  extradition is usually for country a wanting a citizen of * itself * extradited out of country b. 
  rarely for a citizen of any other country than country b , but countries are * never * supposed to extradite their own citizens . 
  that goes completely against what the purpose of countries , namely to protect their own citizens from foreign powers . 
  not for ones own citizens they are not . 
  i 've only ever heard of two , this one and the european one . 
  the latter one was sadly not struck down in court , it 's an abomination . 
   http://london.usembassy.gov/gb176.html[1] : wait what ? 
  usa and uk made a treaty about extraditing their own citizens to the other side ? 
  that 's insane , what the fuck is their problem ? 
    yet when other countries ask for their citizens they refuse  that 's not true . 
  since when ? 
  when did the usa send over the two dozen cia agents who have european arrest warrants outstanding ? 
   the american arguement here is that the majority of the evidence , victims , and will to prosecute exists where the crime was committed . 
  then send it over . 
  the victims can stay , they are not needed . 
   would iceland still refuse to extradite ? 
  of course . 
   seems like quite a loophole for icelandic citizens that want to commit crimes outside of iceland . 
  dear god , wo n't you people think for a second ? 
  he would be charged , tried , sentenced and imprisoned in iceland . 
  but if the usa refuses to send the evidence over to the icelandic prosecutor there is nothing iceland can do about that . 
  the european court on human rights found that to be violating the european charter on human rights . 
  the brits did n't like the result . 
   noone said anything about letting him go free , did they ? 
  the guy in question was set free , he finished his five year sentence and was n't extradited . 
  the americans wanted to try him for something , but the irish do n't want to do that . 
  it 's all in the article . 
  for unknown reasons you do n't understand that not all supermax prisons are the same . 
  learn to think , okay . 
   what would modern germany do with such individuals as that ? 
  treat them as any other prisoner obviously . 
  you are n't making much sense . . 
  and many times they do n't even get their vote back after they are released . 
   would modern germany actually try to rehabilitate the ss and nsdap obviously . 
  it actually did every time it sentenced a ss/nsdap member for any crime they commited . 
   my point is that killing is often a justified and proportional response to someone 's actions ( morally ) , you 're saying it never is but still trying to also argue that killing for self-defence is fine . 
  we are discussing inhumane solitary confinement , dude , try to keep up . 
  if someone is ** actively trying to kill me ** then it 's obviously okay for me to stop him from doing that . 
  that does n't need to be discussed , his human rights are not violated in that case . 
  what is wrong with reddit , this is so fucking annoying . 
  every time some idiot gets into threads . 
   no , i 'm not - yes , you did . 
  that jew in your example shot a hitler that would be killing more jews . 
  you should read my edited comment for an actual example , oh hell , i 'll copy it here : you phrased the question completely wrong , you should have asked : `` is it okay for a jew to break into the prison hitler is being held at ( and being no danger to anyone ) and shoot the guy ? '', 
  the answer is obviously : no , that 's not okay . 
  and neither would it be okay to hold hitler in 24/7 solitary confinement without even a radio . 
   you just said everyone is treated the same , so do hitler 's human rights not matter to you ? 
  you are not seriously arguing * against * self defense ? 
  what is wrong with you ?!, 
  you phrased the question completely wrong , you * should * have asked : `` is it okay for a jew to break into the prison hitler is being held at ( and being no danger to anyone ) and shoot the guy ? '', 
  the answer is obviously : no , that 's not okay . 
  and neither would it be okay to hold hitler in 24/7 solitary confinement without even a radio . 
   you 'll forgive me if i do n't feel a great deal of sympathy for their murderers ' living conditions right now . 
  dude , it 's not about sympathy . 
   their human rights are n't being violated , 24/7 solitary ? 
  yes , they are !, 
   how far can we push this line of thought though ? 
  there is no pushing involved . 
  noone is to be treated inhumane , case closed . 
   getting full godwin 's law here , if a jew shot hitler after escaping from a gas chamber , would you be condemning him for doing to hitler what he did to others , and bringing us down to his level ? 
  or would you say `` nah , maybe that dude deserved it '' ? 
  no inhumane treatment involved in that question of yours , you should rephrase . 
  that jew acted in self defense/defense of others . 
  try to stay on topic , okay ? 
   there are supermax prisons in europe as well , even if they are n't as extreme as florence . 
  there are no prisons that are anything like american supermax prisons . 
   really ? 
  are convicted terrorists and murderers treated the exact same as people who commit parking violations in germany ? 
  none of them are treated inhumane . 
  your question does somehow make me believe you are nuts . 
   similar levels of security exist in europe as well . 
  you can not actually believe that , why are you trolling ? 
   but i do n't really think the conditions there are really inhumane for the level of people that are incarcerated there . 
  inhumaneness does n't change based on the victim . 
  what ? 
  your comment sounded like you think it 's okay to be cruel and inhumane to the list of inmates you typed . 
   by the way , the list of inmates at florence is really `` who 's who '' of notorious terrorists and criminals oh , then it 's totally okay !, 
   the article is referring to conditions at one prison , adx florence . 
  btw : that information is in the article . 
  mh , okay , a quarter then . 
  if you phrase it like that , sure . 
  but it 's not `` and well most people '' . 
   i worded that a bit weird i guess , i meant that 's the greatest accumulation of people or the highest density density in berlin is about three times as high ...  edit : this is a list of german metropolitan areas , with ruhr having almost twice the inhabitants of nr .2 berlin sure , but 11 million is n't even close to `` most germans '' or half of 80 millions . 
   that 's what he calculated with .
