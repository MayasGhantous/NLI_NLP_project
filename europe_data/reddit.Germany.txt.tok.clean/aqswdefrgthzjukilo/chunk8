  34 $ per return flight + 6 $ & # 14 for transit . 
  maybe , but he still is n't doing that . 
   but people still want energy to be affordable , that 's a different issue . 
   and coal kills way more people than nuclear power . 
  you must have missed something . 
  most ? 
  wikipedia says it 's only 5 million in the actual ruhrgebiet . 
  maybe another five million around it in other cities associated with it , but that 's about it . 
   obviously not the germans , since they are somehow against nuclear power . 
  replacing a bad thing with another bad thing does n't really help much . 
   anyway , i figured that even if everything went to shit because of climate change it 'll be after i 'm dead , so i 'm not worried . 
  exactly my reasoning . 
   would probably still have quite a carbon footprint . 
  who the fuck cares ? 
  his commute is * 11 * hours , he is not doing that every day . 
  well , nearly half of all brits live in it . 
  his commute is 5.5 hours one-way , so ... yeah . 
  ah , okay , that makes sense . 
  that 's supposed to be a male voice singing that german theme son ? 
  did it ? 
  yeah , something was seriously weird about that voice . 
  i hate him with a fiery vengeace . 
  seriously , that fucking theme song ... now that 'll stick in my head for days . 
  thanks !, 
  to confuse even more , most bars will bring you a .3 l glas when you order `` a beer '' and either .4 l or .5 l when you order `` a large beer . '' . 
  and in cologne one glas of k\u00f6lsch is only .2 l. 
  oh mine too , i was just offering friendly advice , do n't worry about it . 
  well we do n't have a word in german for `` pint '' except maybe `` halbe '' meaning `` half '' as in `` one half liter of beer '' . 
  coincidentally that 's about as much as a pint . 
  a bottle of tuborg in a bar for only 15kr ? 
  is that possible ? 
   it rarely succeeds 3 euros for 0.5 liters . 
  you probably meant `` surpasses '' . 
  he wrote '' .5 l '' , not 1l . 
  i do n't understand what you mean ? 
  in bavaria you can order whole litre , but maybe not in bars . . 
  they are only very minor exceptions , so we really do have a minimum wage . 
  i 'd love a $ 5 coin . . 
  to them it feels like they live in somalia . 
   why should they ? 
  nobody can make them . 
  if they are forced out of the euro there are zero incentives to pay anything . 
  that will totally motivate anyone else to ever loan them a single cent again . -  uh , no it sadly is n't . 
  since you assumed that i was greek . 
  yes , it really is irrelevant if you are greek or not . 
   no there was n't . 
  all charts i 've seen say there were . 
   wtf do you mean by possibly ?!, 
  this is one of the worst recessions in history outside of war . 
  we suffered from the same recession . 
   it is extremely unlikely that any other measure than our `` rettungsprogramm '' could have had such an abysmal result . 
  all charts i 've seen prove that it worked pretty well . 
  maybe we should get some somalians in this thread to tell the romanians to quit complaning about how poor they are . 
  irrelevant . 
   so your problem is that you do n't understand either the concept of unsustainable debt or default . 
  i understand both perfectly . 
  you seem to be of the opinion that `` default '' means `` wo n't pay , ever '' , which is wrong . 
  it means `` wo n't pay ** now ** '' . 
   absolutely . 
  greece like iceland woud be in a much better situation today if they had defaulted on their private creditors in 2010 . 
  possibly . 
   help '' that reduces the gdp by 25 percent and brings unemployment up to 25 percent , while increasing the debt to gdp ration to 180 percent is actually the opposite of `` help '' . 
  it 's willful destruction . 
  they are in a worse situation today than they were five years ago . 
  there was a bit of growth last year , but now they fucked it up again . 
   how ? 
  are you going to make them ? 
  either the debt will be restructured or they will default on all of it . 
  defaulting does not make the debt go away !, 
   of course it seems extremely unlikely that a `` aufstocker '' would lose any money in that , so yeah you are most likely safe . 
  still , the rest of us will have to pay for irresponsible bankers who loaned to incompetent greek gevernments in greece . 
  there is no way around it now . 
  that will be socialized . 
  you are very funny , but they will pay . 
   `` it 's easier for the poor since they 're already poor , think of the rich !! '', 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  but there 's no need to be a dick about that . 
   but that does not mean that romanians being rather annoyed at the greeks basically demanding free money from others to remain being better off than them is somehow `` quite irrelevant '' . 
  yes , it does . 
  the romanians in / r/europe keep complaining all the time `` but we have it so much worse ! '', 
  and it 's fucking annoying . 
  probably , but besides the point . 
  i 'm not saying i do n't want our money back , i 'm just saying it 's understandable that the greeks are not happy about what 's happening . 
   the greek gdp is more than twice what we have , with half the population . 
  yet you are still complaining and believing populist politicians . 
  that 's actually quite irrelevant . 
  the point is that the greece lost what they once had , that 's very understandably very difficult for them . 
  romania never had what the greece had , so it 's much easier for them . 
   ok now i have two comments from you in my inbox 1 ) claiming '' [ t ] here will be no haircut , pay up '' and also stating '' [ u ] sually we call this `` sending money '' '' while at the same time thinking that asking for a restructuring of the debt is `` demanded even more help '' so you dimly understand that there is a difference between sending money and lending money . 
  no , not really . 
  there will definitely be no gifts , so it 's quite obvious that it 's always debt . 
    greece will pay their debt whenever they feel like it and everybody else can go on with their lifes . 
   so you hate losing some of the money but are completely fine with losing all of it ? 
  i would not lose a single cent in any case . 
  i specifally wrote `` greece ** will pay their debt ** '' . 
   right ... the bank is your friend that is why they give you loans . 
  i see , you would have preferred ... absolutely no help at all ? 
  we are not greeces bank !, 
   we did it in realitly to save german banks and the financial system as a whole it had never anything to do with greece . 
  really ?
