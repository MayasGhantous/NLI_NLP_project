someone from iran could be an atheist and they would still be assumed to be a muslim and called a muslim based on nationality alone . 
  of course that 's an extreme example , but a lot of muslims in western countries are actually cultural muslims that are barely religious and do n't practice except for meeting family on holidays and such . 
  people still act like they 're isis . 
  nationality is not a choice mate . 
  yes , i have opinions about people based on the things they say and do . 
  sue me . 
  yes , he does n't seem to understand that , either . 
  that 's probably not what you meant - but yeah , i do n't think foreign politicians wearing one of those pink pussy hats for a visit to the white house would be a great idea . 
  or a hijab , or anything else that sends a strong anti-trump message . 
  yeah , and in other places teenagers have no access to contraceptives , get abstinence only sex ed , or [ shit like this happens ] ( http://countercurrentnews.com/2015/03/two-teens-neither-could-legally/ ) . 
  because a lot of people are suddenly very very concerned about women 's rights when muslims or refugees are involved , but stick to their usual ways of slut-shaming , calling every rape accusation fake and general sexism when there are no muslims in sight . 
  and people who do n't understand that being as confrontational as possible is not always the best way to make progress . 
   that 's not really oppression ... ? 
  banning teenagers from having sex seems pretty oppressive from here . 
  the hijab proponents would argue that making women wear a hijab is just legislating decent clothing , like laws against women going topless in public , or dress codes at public schools . 
  or that it 's meant to get sexual attraction out of the way so women are objectified less . 
  they probably do n't consider it oppressive . 
  the fact that you ca n't eliminate a problem entirely does not mean that you should do nothing about it . 
  stop thinking of all the media outlets across the world as a single monolithic entity . 
  you 're literally lumping thousands of them together so you can dismiss them all at once . 
  and believe it or not , bias is not a monopoly of the left , steve bannon should have taught you that much . 
  it 's a political cartoon , they exaggerate by definition . 
  also , keep in mind that the political center in german would be solidly on the left in the usa , and germany has seen two regimes in the recent past where by any reasonable definition , freedom just did not exist . 
  they 're wary for a reason . 
  do you get this critical every time a news article implies that illegal immigrants or terrorism are an existential threat to the us , btw ? 
  i do n't see trump being called out as a sign for loss of integrity , quite the opposite . 
   the lie is that president trump is ending freedom in america . 
  he is shown as having decapitated ( an islamic tradition he is attempting to halt , mind you ) lady liberty . 
  that 's not a lie , freedom of movement is being restricted based on religion . 
  if you disagree , it 's called having an opinion , which is covered by both freedom of speech and freedom of the arts . 
  banning this would certainly result in ending freedom in america , or wherever that law applies . 
  edit : this being about ` ending freedom ' is also your interpretation . 
  the symbolism of the statue is closely tied to immigration today , which he also restricted by banning previously completely legal immigrants from returning . 
  drawings are lies now ? 
  what falsehood is that cover expressing ? 
   permanently free to spread lies - vs - temporarily forced to speak truth . 
  do you have any example of the spiegel permanently or even purposefully spreading lies ? 
  funny , it looks like post-factual denial of reality from here . 
  no , thank you for helping make fascism great again . 
  really appreciate it . 
  you 're worried about islam , but you 're not worried about the dangerous ideology hidden behind trump and modern republicans ? 
  only one of those two is holding the most powerful position in the world , and has the literal power to destroy it on a whim . 
   that the media is tamed ...  reforming the media must be at the top of the list of any new nationalist administration . 
  there goes freedom of the press . 
  and do tell , how exactly should trump reform the ** german ** media ? 
  because i am pretty sure that someone would have to occupy germany first to make that work . 
   has n't that been rescinded already ? 
  the visa/green card part of the migration ban i mean . 
  for green card holders ? 
  yes , but not thanks to trump or any part of his administration . 
  for visas ? 
  nope , 60k to 100k ( depending on who you ask ) visas were revoked and are staying revoked . 
   how would any of this be criticism of me personally ? 
  i 'm just asking questions here . 
  you 're a trump supporter and you guys on that subreddit get so pissed at criticism that you banned it . 
  99.9 % of the time someone claims to be `` just asking questions '' , they 're just pretending to be stupid . 
  like when you 're pretending that you do n't understand where the sentiment of the spiegel cover could possibly come from . 
  did you somehow miss that 60k to 100k legal visa holders were banned from entering the us with no notice period whatsoever ? 
  or the people with valid green cards ? 
  oh , nevermind , you 're not really looking for an explanation , you just ca n't deal with criticism . 
   or maybe , just maybe , those hundreds of media organizations are owned by the same few parent corporations , which all have overlapping shareholders . 
  not true in germany , try again . 
  `` america first '' is a play on the slogan , america/freedom is the first decapitation , more are to come . 
   it does n't take a genius to realize that perhaps integrity of media is compromised yeah , there is a worldwide media conspiracy . 
  of hundreds of news organizations . 
  it 's the only possible explanation . 
  or maybe , just maybe , they are writing stuff that is of interest to their readers , and there are not a lot of nice things to be said about the guy . 
   i am supporting this sexist nazi but i am not a sexist nazi , i swear !, 
  i just do n't mind !, 
  why would they allow unilateral free movement ? 
  there 's really nothing to say at this point . 
  elections in germany are n't going to change a thing btw . 
  i am pretty sure it 's reasonable to be worried about things before they personally affect me . 
  do n't get so easily triggered by people 's opinions . 
   imagine a muslim ingermany calling for the death of infidels and illegally acquiring weapons and ammo . 
  would you not deem it appropriate to lock such a person up ? 
  yes , but that is not what happened here , even according to the most pro-russian sources . 
  he owned the guns legally with a license and did not call for anyone 's death . 
  merkel is liberal by us standards because the political spectrum is shifted so far to the right in the us compared to germany and does not question things like public health insurance , entitlements and free university-level education she is conservative by german standards , though . 
  berlin is at least as gay as cologne . 
  germany was one of the first countries to introduce civil unions , but we never gomade those equal to marriage . 
  one major thing missing is adoption rights . 
  `` i can read this '' is pretty difficult to decide with binary data , since it 's not human-readable in the first place and can look completely random . 
  the only part that 's easily identified are the file headers , but you could just attach those to your encrypted data , too . 
  everyone in this thread keeps going on about steganography , but you would n't even need to do that . 
  the us never pledged $ 100 billion . 
  $ 100 billion is the goal for the entire fund , from both public ( a number of countries donating to the fund ) and private ( companies , charities , ... ) sources combined . 
  the usa under obama pledged to contribute 3 billion , not 100 billion . 
  whoever gave you that number inflated it by a factor of 33 . 
  how is that fair ? 
  wages in munich are a lot higher than in berlin . 
  [ china is n't getting any of that money , india is getting one project out of many ] ( http://www.greenclimate.fund/projects/browse-projects?p_p_id=101_instance_hreg2cakdehl&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=_118_instance_4zrnuzrwpeqo__column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_101_instance_hreg2cakdehl_delta=30&amp;_101_instance_hreg2cakdehl_keywords=&amp;_101_instance_hreg2cakdehl_advancedsearch=false&amp;_101_instance_hreg2cakdehl_andoperator=true&amp;p_r_p_564233524_resetcur=false&amp;_101_instance_hreg2cakdehl_cur=1#portlet_101_instance_hreg2cakdehl ) but what would you do without those 10 bucks , amirite . 
  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/02/climate/trump-paris-green-climate-fund.html note how none of the projects being funded are in china . 
  why do you assume that they are n't doing that ? 
  i do n't know anyone in greenpeace , but i do know other activists , and they 're living what they preach . 
  using a projector does not keep you from using a bike as your main source of transport , eating regional and seasonal food or from minimizing energy usage and consumption in general . 
  umm what ? 
  there 's more than one thing wrong with that sentence , so i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  there are bars with all kinds of target audiences in the eu , do those require scare quotes , too ? 
  have you ever considered that the purpose of `` gay bars '' ( nice scare quotes ) is not just protection from discrimination or persecution ?
