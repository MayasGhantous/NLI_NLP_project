they did that in one of munichs more exclusive nightclubs . 
  everywhere else ist was straight 1:1,92 ... 
  i lost my starter pack on new years eve in a poker round . 
  even before the currency was legal tender . 
  i 'm a florian . 
  yes . 
  never thought about it but it does annoy me a bit . 
  you are not from munich . 
  you are from hinterdupfing 70 km away from munich . 
  good and no . 
  i love the idea . 
  if you focus on local cusine from the different states like philly-cheese-steak or pie or stuff like that . 
  the rest depends on where in europe you 'd actually plan your endevour . 
  i do like it better , too . 
  it was playing everywhere when i was still living there . 
  the pvc version was made popular by the 80 's comic `` der kleene punker '' . 
  and another one comes to mind : [ pvc - berlin by night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t47zdq8hllq ) edit : it 's the original english version of the bel-ami song, 
  yes . 
  even the `` ramrod '' spaceship/robot from saber rider was originally called `` sei j\u016bshi bisumaruku '' - * starship bismarck * . 
  here 's an old punk-song about that situation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3bj-mxxung, 
  idk . 
  austrian flag , vienna , styrian alps ... 
  i think u/wurzn is probably swedish . 
  i a conversation it might have occured that someone uses hans peter as ( just a random name ) . 
  if i know the caller usually hallo or hi or i jump right in . 
  else i alsways say `` ja ? 
  hallo . 
  - just like my dad . 
  would you prefer if i wrote in my native dialect , bavarian , then ? 
  feels kinda wierd to write in dialect . 
  me to . 
  i do n't understand a word though . 
  but i like to belive it 's better that way . 
  sadly the `` lyoner '' has come to be the famously cheap sausage in germany . 
  it 's hardly the top of [ french cuisine ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/41vyzwtdqbl.jpg ) . 
  this statement has to do with my deep felt despise for all religios things . 
  it 's a personal quirk of mine and not always easy to explain . 
  lets just call it my personal `` totalopposition '' . 
  also i think that gauck being a priest had no negative effect on his presidency . 
  you seem to not have heard of the [ schulz-train ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/09/martin-schulz-meme-subreddit-bundestag-german-elections ) yet . 
  to be fair he fullfiled his role with dignety . 
  but steinmeier has a thicker skin and is no priest so yes , big improvement . 
  it 's basically our substitute for a monarch . 
  sadly without glamour and scandals . 
  also used by teens : `` chipscolaflypsy '' said by both people afterwards - the one who says it last has to be silent for a while . 
  just a question . 
  no need to downvote . 
  as the others have stated . 
  if said texan would travel to hinterdupfing ( wich is btw . 
  a fictitious place ) he would stand out like rainbow couloured dog . 
  irritating might be overstating it . 
  a bit ridiculous when a big american walking stereotype stands in front of you and proclaims in texan dialect `` you know im german too . 
  great grandfather came from hinterdupfing - we 're practically brothers '' . 
  well , if you guys keep pulling stunts like electing somebody like trump you should n't be surprised if other countrys think you 're stupid . 
  kind of ironic username you got there . 
  germans hate americans ? 
  i tell you what germans hate : if somebody puts feels over facts . 
  against ttip , yes . 
  obama hinself , [ not so much ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=obama+siegess%c3%a4ule&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1teua_ende493de493&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1215&amp;bih=541&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjyz6tui-rrahxdthqkhyzycosq_auibigb ) . 
  would be nice . 
  but instead of crowds cheering him on like obama there would be immense protests . 
  wich is something the duckman does n't like so i 'm all for it . 
  we 'll make our own nordic union . 
  with blackjack and hookers !, 
  so i went to check him out . 
  hrrr . 
  strage that you guys like that kind of humour . 
  great stuff !, 
  ** schrei nach liebe ** - this is a very important one from the mid '90s strongly voiced against neo-nazis ( arschloch ! ) . 
  but * die toten hosen * had some more iconic songs , like [ opelgang ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igm6tsuilge ) or of course [ hier kommt alex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x-yqphitr8 ) - their hommage to kubrics clockwork orange . 
  i have to agree with the k\u00e4skopp here 100 % . 
  nobody really knows . 
  but [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq97eq0rk2w ) mark hammill reading his ( trumps ) new-year-tweet . 
  interesting perception , you might be on to something here . 
  but i have to admit that i wear sandals at home and always with socks . 
  it 's too cold without . 
  it 's what i 've been using them for my whole live . 
  even right now . 
  [ hausschuhe ] ( http://www.winterleiten.at/images/herrenschuhe/birkenstock%2079%20birkenstock%20arizona%20sfb%20sandale%20brau.jpg ) ( house-shoes ) oder [ h\u00fcttenschuhe ] ( http://www.haflingerversand.de/pic/631051_72_ka.jpg ) . 
  best of both worlds . 
  i do n't get it ? 
  socks and sandals , yes yes , common stereotype . 
  but what has you beeing spanish to do with that ? 
  thing is - i do n't think the current british government lacks the skill or the will to keep london in its current status . 
  alone if inverstors and companies leave to a new hub there is not much may can do . 
  there is a natural limit of what a national governent * can * do . 
  negative . 
  thats what we need the least . 
  we need `` europism '' - or maybe just some optimism . 
   the british government will make sure of that . 
  there are forces at work now that the british government might not be able to control . 
  iow a stiff upper lip might not be enough this time . 
  do n't mind if i do . 
  a common complaint from visitors in germany is that the people all seem to be staring at the visitor ( or anyone ) . 
  this might be true but germans such as i do n't realise it . 
  but since it is a very common complaint it is * some basic info i want a foreinger to know * . 
  we 're not staring . 
  thats how we look . 
  the poem willehalm by wolfram von eschenbach ( ca . 
  1200 a.c. ) does mention an early form of the trebuchet ( dr\u00eebock ) .
