  jk - but you do suck at that sport . 
  haha . 
  good luck , my viking friend . 
  i 'd say : just go for it . 
  take your passport with you and some sort of document for your horse . 
  freedom of travel !, 
  have fun and do n't worry to much . 
  very good idea for an advendture btw . 
  i think it might be northern italy . 
  interrail is quite cheap , since you can ride as many trains as you want . 
  compared to renting a car and paying for fuel , which is like 1,5 $ per liter in germany . 
  also : driving in winter weather can suck ... 
  to not answer your question : i 'd suggest you take the train - http://www.interrail.eu/, 
  if you are in germany , try augustiner ( munich beer , but sold in all major citys ) . 
  it is , afaik , the only major brewery who does n't `` cheat '' the purity law . 
  also it tastes great . 
  he is right , but it should be mentioned that it was a close vote with especially the newer members of the union in favour of a mic-change . 
  luckily the founding states kept it traditional . 
  i love my m\u00fcnchen ( born and raised there ) . 
  but right after oktoberfest it can be a bit boring . 
  berlin is party 365/24/7 - also much closer to denmark , if you have just a weekend . 
  edit : [ x-post from another ask reddit thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hbo89/american_redditors_is_there_an_european_product/ckrdm1v ), 
  include berlin in your list of max . 
  4 cities ( great for party ) . 
  i would n't rent a car if i were you . 
  except you want to check out how fast you can get on the autobahn . 
  call customs at your destination airport . 
  ask europe probably ca n't help you since we do n't need visas , sorry . 
  i mean . 
  maybe san francisco ? 
  [ judge for yourself ] ( http://www.stop-kirchensubventionen.de/ ) . 
  32 why do you ask ? 
  one half ist largely atheist ( ex gdr ) , and the other part catholic , part protestant . 
  but even though not many , not even the baptised christians , really truly belive in god/church we keep funding it with literaly hundrets of billions of euros . 
  just so some people get to go to church at christmas eve , have weddings in those nice buildings and their funerals organised . 
  for a rational people like we germans always claim to be , that is one hell of a waste of money . 
  hopefully future generations will correct this flaw . 
  just what i had in mind . 
  february is best for h\u00fcttngaudi !, 
  lidl is a german chain . 
  lidl and aldi are amongst the cheapest . 
  but the farmers and producers pay the price , so it 's not fair . 
  better to buy your grocerys in a bioladen . 
  well . 
  i had bike training in elementary school . 
  it 's basic road rules , and you get [ this ] ( http://www.erlenweg6.de/wp-content/uploads/ehrenwimpel_mia_2014.jpg ) when finished . 
  difficult . 
  i had a pizza in g\u00f6teborg a couple of weeks ago . 
  worst pizza i have ever tried . 
  and criminally expensive . 
  and i always thought the irish were green . 
  again fooled by american television programs ... 
  german white people are much better . 
  when i lean naked against a white wall and close my eyes , nobody can see me . 
  thats how white i am !, 
  he is the prime minister of bavaria ( think gouvernor ) . 
  i do n't get the joke either . 
  one [ culture ] ( http://www.muenchenkotzt.de/ ) coming up !, 
  this sounds horrible . 
  this mistake of beeing to late is a mistake a business partner makes one time . 
  else : no more business . 
  and your brother has no self respect !, 
  it 's supposed to be an sinsult i guess ? 
  do n't ask me . 
  it 's what google has to offer in terms of `` most badass spanish insult '' ... 
  * my place *, 
  this for some reason makes me so angry . 
  spain !!!, 
  we will get you some day . 
  grrrr . 
  munich : skip the hofbr\u00e4uhaus . 
  it 's really just for tourists . 
  try any other wirtschaft . 
  also l\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukeller is awfull . 
  i would recomend augustiner br\u00e4ustubn . 
  awesome , merci beaucoup !, 
  well thank you , i look forward to it . 
  it 's hard to google ... 
  not what i hoped for , but thank you . 
  what did she say ? 
  i watched the thing in vienna , wich was funny . 
  but we were all a bit sad for france , because the song was actually nice imo . 
  but when the landy ( elodie suigo ? ), 
  came on i could n't tell if she was complaining about the other countrys or what ? 
  could n't find a translation online . 
  help me out here ... 
  hey / r/europe : in the article it also says u.n. 
  shocked u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon expressed shock and alarm at the treatment of refugees and migrants at hungary 's border with serbia . 
  the council of europe human rights body said it had asked hungary to explain its new legislation on the crisis . 
  antonio guterres , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees , urged hungarian authorities to ensure `` unimpeded access '' for people as they flee wars and persecution . 
  we send austria to , once again , kick your submissive asses . 
  that 's how . 
  misleading title . 
  if you chose the eu-flag flair i 'd like to know why ? 
  do you identfy more as a european than a citizen of your home country ? 
  do you just like the color ? 
  is your home-countrys war-flag a white rabbit on a white surface ? 
  i 'm just curious . 
   guilder / mark really ? 
  the gulden were at a fixed rate to the dm ?
