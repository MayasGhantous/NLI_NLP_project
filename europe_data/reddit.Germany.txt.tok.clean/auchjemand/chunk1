the problem is that many neighboring countries have a rather lacking high speed network ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/high_speed_railroad_map_of_europe_2015.svg ), 
  there are some runes from that time period that were found in the region : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:elder_futhark_inscriptions.png the earliest written texts in a germanic language are actually in east germanic and date from the 4th century ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/codex_argenteus ) also of course there are the roman sources about the people that lived there . 
  it seems to me that it 's a consensus that germanic tribes lived in what 's nowadays poland before the migration period . 
   `` germanic '' tribes . 
  really ? 
  that demonym was used by ancient roman historians to describe the people in northern europe sorry but that 's not right . 
  the book germania for instance describes north , west and east germanic speaking tribes and also non germanic ones https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germania_ ( book ) . 
  using the word germanic tribes is just as non-problematic as using the word slavic tribes . 
   europe was way more dynamic in terms of peoples and cultures through out it 's history . 
  total agreement . 
  this is always important to remember . 
  using times no one still alive today lived in as a reason for acting negatively is very idiotic . 
  it 's way more productive to use history to find things we have in common . 
  they do n't need visas for schengen though, 
  or like not requiring visa from persons from the people 's republic of china if they reside in hong kong/macau but require one from people from the rest of china . 
  which is what we 're actually doing . 
  the founder moved back to sweden after his wife died as far as i know . 
  we can learn from fukushima that unknown unknowns are a concern for the safety of nuclear reactors . 
  the fukushima disaster was totally unexpected and what we learned is that we should expect further disasters to unfold in ways we did n't think of . 
  the moon just be really tall in that region, 
  i was alluding to the pentagrams in the window, 
  i lived for half a year at \u00d6stra stranden . 
  the church in sn\u00f6storp was really a nice surprise to me as halmstad does n't have that much architecturally . 
  sadly i have n't seen the inside : /, 
  greece has a smaller public sector than germany and greeks retire later than germans . 
  before chernobyl chernobyl was unimaginable . 
  the 25 years after chernobyl another catastrophe was unimaginable , at least in western reactors . 
  pretend all problems are magically gone as soon as you exit the eu ? 
  hindsight is 20/20, 
  why not burn the money directly instead ? 
  [ olkiluoto 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant#unit_3 ) and [ flamanville 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flamanville_nuclear_power_plant ) are disasters in both cost and build time . 
  [ hinkley point c ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hinkley_point_c_nuclear_power_station ) will get a guaranteed fixed price for electricity that 's higher than the guaranteed feed in tariff for photovoltaics in germany -- and it will even rise with inflation . 
  just because the general attitude towards homosexuality is negative does n't mean that no homosexuals exist . 
  i think you can say that for instance the recent ban on homosexuals on television is homophobic . 
  the feelings towards homosexuality might not be as strong as in other countries but seem to be mostly negative . 
  china is pretty homophobic despite being strongly anti-religion . 
  international treaties ban sending nuclear waste to other countries . 
  fun fact : san marino is the only european country where its citizens can visit mainland china visa-free, 
  germany 's co \u2082 emissions are going down : http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/styles/800w400h/public/medien/384/bilder/2_abb_thg-emissionen_2016-01-20.png?itok=ipfujk6m&amp;c=96316b8aadd0a03f772582e65629c8b9 one reason why germany 's emissions are so high is that there 's still extremely much industry there . 
  heh , her parents also cited cultural differences as a reason why we should break up when they found out/she told them about us . 
  i think paint lasts longer in colder climates . 
  more like extreme conservative behaviour . 
  my atheist chinese ex-gf also was n't allowed contact with guys except for university purposes . 
  in the past there were refugees that came from russia into norway . 
  you can also swim from helsing\u00f8r to helsingborg btw . 
  countries that want refugees want an eu-wide/schengen-wide system , but they do n't want to have a quota . 
  countries that do n't want refugees do n't want an eu-wide regulation as that would mean more refugees for them so they block all changes . 
   permanent geological storage is n't an option why exactly ? 
  water creeping in seems to be a problem everywhere . 
  at the yucca mountain facility through fractures : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yucca_mountain_nuclear_waste_repository#geology it 's also a problem for former salt mines : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asse_ii_mine#water_inflow they already have some problems with contaminated brine there , the german wikipedia article is way more expansive on it : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schachtanlage_asse#radioaktiv_kontaminierte_salzlauge  you can provide peak load with whatever you want , the reason gas is used for load following is because its some of the most expensive generation on the market . 
  no you ca n't , shutting down coal plants or nuclear plants takes too long . 
  gas is used because it 's fast enough even though it 's expensive . 
  it would n't make sense to use it if there were cheaper alternatives . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peaking_power_plant you can do a bit of load following with nuclear or coal , but that ca n't replace gas ( or hydroelectrics ) . 
  the nuclear reactors we have today are extremely old , already ran longer than what they were originally built for and it 's not economically feasible to build new reactors in western europe . 
  also we should produce a bit less of nuclear waste , while we still ca n't deal with it safely and economically . 
  ( also you should probably strike gas off that list as it 's important for providing peak load ), 
  i was more alluding to [ dust collection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dust_collector ) , [ flue-gas desulfurization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flue-gas_desulfurization ) and flue-gas denitrification . 
  contrary to china the use of them is enforced . 
  what makes the clouds form ( and be white ) is steam . 
  sure they are still leading to air pollution ( and in the long term more important they emit tons of co2 ) and they 're the next reactors to shut down after the nuclear ones like they should be . 
  but german coal use is not the air polluter you make it out to be . 
  just take a look at an air quality index map : http://aqicn.org/map/#@g/52.2788/10.2287/6z rural germany is pretty comparable to rural france . 
  the real problem is the cities . 
  your picture is from china , in germany coal plants are a bit cleaner . 
  how common is low german ( nedersaksisch ) still in the netherlands ? 
  even in germany it seems to be quite rare today . 
  greetings from the high franconian dialect area !, 
  countries do n't offer asylum because they see a financial gain, 
  it 's more like 30 seconds and sometimes the animal is allowed to get an electro narcosis . 
  if you 're really concerned about animal welfare you probably should n't eat meat after all . 
  lol austria northern europe, 
  there are forests in denmark ? 
   germans came out clean and admitted all of the horrible things they have done in the past century . 
  that 's only true for one of the two genocides : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide, 
  and jews in germany saw themselves as germans . 
  still germans killed hundreds of thousands of jewish germans . 
  i do n't really get your argument . 
  yes sure as soon as the borders are closed , governments will take in as much refugees as before . 
  it will be very popular in the population . 
  also then suddenly all refugees will be real refugees , while now all are fake refugees . 
  certainly we should n't support refugees at the place where they currently are , because the internally displaced in syria , the people in libanon and turkey already have it so good . 
  i always wonder what the uk really wants to change . 
  it 's not like member states ca n't already do extremely much against welfare abuse from citizens of other eu countries . 
  you 're only allowed to move to another eu country if you will work there , study there or have already have enough money to support yourself . 
  otherwise you can only stay 3 months . 
  if migrants do n't fulfill these rules they can get sent back . 
  you can set how long people have to work to be able to get benefits . 
  you just need to found a newspaper and you can write whatever you want . 
  however a ) you 're probably too lazy for that , b ) nobody wants to read just ramblings . 
  did you even read what i wrote ? 
  i actually wrote that comments are there for when the article is wrong or there is more information . 
  with several topics comments get used just to voice an opinion , which is not what the comments are there for . 
  they 're not silencing anyone . 
  it 's their website with their content and they can publish whatever they want . 
  then they probably heavily moderated them and that was a lot of work for them . 
  no they just do n't want to be a platform for idiots to spew their shit . 
  they are a newspaper that wants to publish articles . 
  comments are there for when an article gets something wrong or when there 's further information that might be interesting to the reader . 
  if you want to voice your opinion write an opinion piece that is coherent and well-written enough to be run by a newspaper/magazine .
