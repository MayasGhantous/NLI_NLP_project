  did n't know merkel was supporting the collectivization of the means of production . 
  did you even read that article ? 
   the natural nuclear reactor formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater radionuclides contaminating groundwater is basically the worst case scenario for what can happen with nuclear waste storage . 
  for instance instability by the tunnels can be a problem with salt mines and water is entering salt mines way more commonly than thought . 
  this was only found out after dumping nuclear waste in a way that is hard to recover : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asse_ii_mine in sweden i think there is currently a scientific debate if the copper capsules used for nuclear waste will be subjected to acidic environments which would destroy those capsules . 
  i have n't heard about earthquakes being a problem for nuclear waste storage , can you link me to more information ? 
  coal has been stable to slightly falling while nuclear was reduced . 
  nuclear was replaced with renewables . 
  there are several other factors of safety than death : - * food safety : * to this day radioactive contamination is a problem because of chernobyl . 
  this can go as far as game meat in germany . 
  no other energy production method has this problem . 
  - * water safety : * storing nuclear waste might be a problem for water supply - * catastrophes : * individual accidents can be dealt with more easily than with catastrophes . 
  there is no such thing as a solar catastrophe . 
  - * evacuations * - * safety of land : * in the case of a nuclear disaster the land is practically lost for centuries and longer timespans . 
  - * illness : * you might not die from cancer ( we gladly are getting much better at treating it ) , but it still very much sucks . 
  ps : the death per kwh numbers for nuclear often cited [ are tweaked to be low ] ( http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/blogs/nuclear-reaction/deaths-and-energy-technologies/blog/34275/ ) . 
   there are hundreds of places that ** we think ** are geologically stable enough to hold waste fixed that for you . 
  we do n't have enough experience yet . 
  things that might seem really safe in the beginning might turn out to be bad . 
  that happened with salt mines . 
  the currently best option is to keep it around and decide later what to do with it . 
  because of the intolerant dog-lover dictator minority it 's not even legal to eat dog meat in europe . 
   medical marijuana is not weed just like medicinal whiskey was not booze during the prohibition . 
   dislike for the principle of laws emanating from a supranational body ,  rather than a problem with the actual rights in the convention . 
  you 're contradicting yourself here . 
  the econventionhr is only about the rights outlined in it . 
  it 's also important to note that the uk took a great role in drafting the convention . 
   along with legal oversight from courts that trump the uk 's own highest national courts this dislike either means the ecourthr has some problems and is not acting correctly along the rights outlined in the convention ( i do n't think so ) or the uk does n't like some human rights ( i will argue for that ) . 
  i think it can pretty well argued that the latter is the case . 
  the issue the uk has with the econventionhr is that people that it wants to extradite are humans too and have human rights . 
  this prevents the uk from extraditing some people it would rather extradite because it would mean they could get killed/tortured/etc . 
  if you look at previous cases by the ecourthr concerning the uk , it 's also easy to argue that it helped to hold up human rights that uk courts could n't : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-has-the-european-court-of-human-rights-done-for-us-a7000531.html the most terrible signal an brexit of the econventionhr would give is that countries can just select on their own which human rights apply and to which persons they apply . 
  being part of the european convention on human rights is a condition for being in the eu . 
  they can only leave it when they also leave the eu . 
  in the last years there has been a dislike for the human rights as outlined in the echr , so it 's not unlikely that the uk wants to scrap the echr applying to it when they leave the eu . 
  sweden is also the only country where men shower more than women http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/how-often-people-in-various-countries-shower/385470/,

  much more weird is btw the dutch use of the word where it can also mean sexy : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lekker#dutch, 
  i do n't know what problems people have with systembolaget , it 's a pretty nice shop except not offering beer in crates . 
  the only real problem is that alcohol and especially beer is too expensive . 
  that nurses from other countries are better because they have a better education . 
  the apprenticeships are far from tertiary education at a university , however they often fit what companies are actually needing quite well . 
  sometimes though it leads to a relatively low standard compared to other european countries like with nurses , if what i have heard is true . 
  they 're actually more likely to be derived of the western germanic version of the germanic gods than the northern germanic ones . 
  it 's s\u00f6ndag and not s\u00f6ldag after all and there 's also the case with friday : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-germanic/frijj\u014dz_dagaz#descendants, 
  this shows that we should have more ambitious goals . 
  it 's like making a deal with your mayor of your little town that you do n't have to pay any municipal taxes . 
  you both know that this is not legal ( or you 're dumb if you believe it ) , you ca n't get special tax rules just because you 're friends with the mayor . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_group  an ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on ** common language ** , ancestral , social , ** cultural ** , or national experiences . 
   most inhabitants speak swedish ( the sole official language ) as their first language : 90.2 % in 2009 ,  they may be considered either ethnic swedes or swedish-speaking finns [ = finland swedes ] so yes , you could say that the majority are ethnic ( finland ) swedes, 
  by nationality or what ? 
  certainly a lot more by ethnicity : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c5land_islands#ethnicity_and_language,

  it 's the profits they made in the whole eu . 
  west germany 's gdp was 190 billion dollar in 1948 when the marshall plan started according to the only source i could find ( which was inflation adjusted to 1990 ) . 
  germany got 1.5 billion dollar from the marshall plan during 6 years . 
  the highly positive effect is widely accepted . 
  ( which would be around 8 billion dollar in 1990 inflation adjusted ) so even while it was a smaller percentage than the eu benefits of poland , it 's highly accepted that the marshall plan helped german , and even continues to help it today : the [ kfw bank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kfw ) was formed as part of the marshall plan . 
  infrastructure is only around half of what the structural funds of the eu are used for , and they certainly lead to a benefit of the economy . 
  poland got 67 billion euro as structural funds in 2007 -- 2014 ( this does n't even include the agricultural subsidies ) . 
  as a comparison , poland had a gdp of 205 billion euro when it coined the eu in 2004 . 
  sure it took hard work from poland , but the eu also played a role in the development of poland . 
  nice to see eu money at work , 
   at least eight years before the uk is fully and totally out of europe -- if we finally leave at all . 
  did n't know the uk is a ship and not an iland . 
  that 's pretty much a myth . 
  the production capacity persisted throughout the war to produce the things needed for war . 
   if other western european countries do n't join in on the race to the bottom ftfy, 
  it 's in the occupied franconian areas , bavarians themselves are catholic . 
  way more interesting in my opinion is the development of the baltic sea . 
  it changed a few times between being a sea and a lake , the last time being around 8 000 years ago as the [ ancylus llake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancylus_lake ) . 
  yeah fuck the environment when you can make business !, 
   40 % to get what your family made are 40 % of lots of money for which you did n't do anything at all in return . 
  all the economists and politicians talk about living in a performance oriented society , but the reality is that to be wealthy is mostly about being born in the right family .

  but it 's not like we europeans do n't do the same shit to asians .

   the obama administration has made the us step back from the globe as the world police , and the eu has ignored the vacuum of instability that was created . 
  the instability was created by the us playing world police , not by stepping back from that . 
   co-ordinate between security agencies and police . 
  you mean like in good old nazi germany ?
