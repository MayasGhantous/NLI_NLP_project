  police and security agencies need to be separate to ensure rule of law . 
  only it was not caused by olive oil but by too much pesticides on tomatoes more likely : https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/aug/25/research.highereducation, 
   it already has passed the point of rehabilitation since so many tend to make the same mistakes once released from custody . 
  actually tougher sentences lead to higher recidivism rates . 
  there are many , many studies out there about it : e.g. 
   26x3 operators in reality it 's far less operators and most are held by majority by states . 
   safe country with low crime rates . 
  the traffic is relatively unsafe there though : http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/statistics/map-viewer/, 
  in some conditions being pregnant puts your life at risk . 
  if abortion is even illegal in that situation , than the country is detrimental to your safety . 
   people here also seem to think that this is preferable to dissolution of the middle eastern societies . 
  it 's not hard to argue that isis is worse than sadam was, 
   the referendum result had signalled to staff from overseas that they were so it sounds to me like he ca n't get cheap eastern european workers anymore after the brexit , so he moves production somewhere where he can get them . 
  denmark - because their language is so funny ( i learned swedish before i came to that conclusion ) - danes seem to be funny and happy people ( maybe it seems like that because of their language ) - they design nice stuff ( visit illums bolighus , when you 're in scandinavia !, 
  it 's a danish company and much of the stuff is designed by danish designers ) - copenhagen is a really cool city ( ca n't say much about the other ones ) - alcohol is n't as expensive as in sweden only thing that really sucks is nature . 
  too flat and not enough forests for me . 
  the biggest culprits in air pollution in general are n't germany and poland though : [ a table showing the air pollution per capita ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/8d/table2-emissions_of_air_pollutants_by_country_and_per_capita%2c_in_kg%2c_2013.png ) note that only nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides are heavily caused by coal power plants : [ a tables showing sources of pollution for the different pollutant groups ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/5/50/figure2-emissions_of_air_pollutants_by_source_sector%2c_eu28%2c_2013.png ) germany actually is even below eu average in nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide emission . 
  probably because of [ flue-gas desulfurization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flue-gas_desulfurization ) . 
  still replacing coal with renewables makes sense to reduce air pollution even more and co \u2082 drastically . 
  it 's important though to not forget the other big sources of air pollution like agriculture . 
  actually , it is good that the uk will leave for this regard : [ eu dilutes proposal to halve air pollution deaths after uk lobbying ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/03/eu-dilutes-proposal-halve-air-pollution-deaths-uk-lobbying ), 
  i specifically select the option to choose the notes at my atm . 
  10 $ notes are so convenient . 
  if you 'd ask settlers on the west bank if they want to stay part of israel they would probably have an even higher percentage . 
   i dont get what makes zizek special . 
  he is very good at putting his fingers into wounds and showcasing our problems of today 's society . 
  also he talks funny and so on and so on, 
  which is fairly popular in germany ( seen people playing it several times here ) . 
  after finishing with our swedish class we went to the park to play kubb , there also were some finish exchange students there and we also played m\u00f6lkky with them . 
  the eu only sets rules to give freedom of movement to eu citizens . 
  the headlines just say that america spent more totally in afghanistan than the marshall plan , not just in post war things . 
  they also had a referendum on switching from left side drive to right side drive where over 80 % voted staying on the left side . 
  there are some further options ( according to http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/how-to-leave-the-eu/ ) - a free trade deal more like the one between canada and the eu . 
  would take ages , just like a swiss like deal . 
  the eu is saying for years that the deal with switzerland was not the correct way forward , so it might be more probably than a swiss like deal . 
  - unilateral free trade . 
  basically wto rules with no import tariffs . 
  could be done immediately but would probably destroy the economy . 
  that 's sweden and you forgot to mention that the fish is so poisonous , that it 's banned for sale in the rest of the eu ( fish from the baltic sea have too high dioxin content ) . 
  done , i submitted the whole article where this is from though . 
  i do n't think they want to go through all laws and change a huge part of them just to spite the eu . 
  i guess the eu dropping special cases for the uk will have a greater impact in making eu regulations and uk law incompatible . 
  there are very few eu laws that apply directly . 
  most of the time there 's eu regulation which the member states put into local laws . 
  most of those laws will just stay in place , others will get repealed . 
  it actually needs to reform some structures first . 
  so far i met no one ( even political science students being interested into europe ) that can explain what the council of europe , the european council and the council of the european union are . 
  the reason nobody knows , is because the structures are simply too complex . 
  the difference is that the uk already follows ( almost ) all eu regulations , so there 's less adaptation needed . 
  somebody should have shown them this graphic when they talked about stopping immigration through a norway-like deal : http://2ihmoy1d3v7630ar9h2rsglp.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/open_europe_graph_151027.png, 
  yeah in southern bavaria bavarian dialects are spoken , of which austrian german also is a big part . 
  this articles has a nice overview of the differences between being in the eu and a norway-like relationship : http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/what-would-a-norway-style-relationship-with-the-eu-entail/, 
  we should start banning cars in situations where the pollution is too high . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_pollution#health_effects  causes of deaths include strokes , heart disease , copd , lung cancer , and lung infections, 
  cloudberry on finish 2 $ coin . 
  why ? 
  because they 're tasty . 
  they have easy access to the financial market of the eu through the uk though . 
  you can follow rivers . 
  they 're not only rare , jews and muslims can not marry in israel . 
  [ spain signals it would block eu air access deal unless terms exclude gibraltar airport ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/a62b292a-ef99-11e6-930f-061b01e23655 ), 
  you just need to get close to large bodies of water and the weather stays at really nice temperatures : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malcesine#climate in bigger cities like milano or rome it can get worse , but in neither of them it ever reached 40 \u00b0 c. 
  meanwhile here in franconia that already happened a few times . 
  luckily during the last big heatwave i was in sweden, 
  that does n't explain why greeks are so unhealthy then . 
  i guess it is a lot of factors . 
  weather that is neither too hot nor too cold , [ low obesity rates ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:proportion_of_women_who_were_overweight_or_obese,_2008_or_nearest_year_ ( % 25 ) _ health2015.png ) and probably others . 
  the austria thing does not make any sense . 
  their previous currency was locked to the dm 7:1 before since pretty much forever , so they effectively already had a common currency with germany . 
  also with a lot of other countries like france it also does n't make any sense to blame the euro . 
  first there were fixed rates with bretton woods , then the snake in the tunnel ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/snake_in_the_tunnel ) , then the [ ems ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_monetary_system ) including the [ erm ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_exchange_rate_mechanism ) until the euro was introduced . 
  so basically france , the benelux , germany and denmark have been pegged to a narrow band to each other since the second world war . 
  you should be concerned about people wanting to defend themselves with guns as it escalates situations needlessly and leads to more dead people from guns . 
  or rather deactivated weapons that were sold legally : [ charlie hebdo shootings : automatic rifles used in paris attacks traced to shop in slovakia ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11420946/charlie-hebdo-shootings-automatic-rifles-used-in-paris-attacks-traced-to-shop-in-slovakia.html ) which is actually what the regulation is about among other sensible things . 
  of course you go against legal owners if you outlaw something . 
  that 's totally independent of if what you 're outlawing makes sense . 
  and for the not properly deactivated weapons it certainly makes sense . 
  you can gain dual citizenship by birth . 
  with eu countries this restriction does not apply . 
  did n't they hear that the saxophone is one the way out ? 
  because belgian beers have too much alcohol . 
  you can not drink as much . 
  the 2 +1 system is so nice that it 's getting adopted in germany . 
  not even then . 
  criminals should have the opportunity to reintegrate into society . 
   lpt : if a comment is introduced with this , it 's usually a ~ ~ popular ~ ~ ** populist ** opinion . 
  there are open borders with several countries outside the eu : switzerland , norway , all those micronations . 
  there 's still bamberg with a bit of research . 
  it wo n't be cheaper for the bankers . 
  they will continue getting their food from the eu as they probably wo n't like the chlorinated chickens the plebs will have to eat . 
  there 's no research happening there . 
  they 're the periphery of bavaria . 
  seems like a populist bullshit measure : - hardly happens in europe to see people with a burqa - is actually a relatively minor issue - the ban probably wo n't change anything, 
  that 's a pretty stupid reason , the parliament is the part of the eu that is the least to blame for the failings of the eu . 
  most free imperial cities of the holy roman empire still have eagles today in their coat of arms . 
  interestingly microsoft offers hosting in their cloud in europe for a premium . 
  that only helps a bit and only temporarily . 
  if you rely too much on it you will start a [ currency war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/currency_war ), 
  oh no you found out about our plan to bring back order by getting rid of leap seconds . 
  it 's actually the other way around .
