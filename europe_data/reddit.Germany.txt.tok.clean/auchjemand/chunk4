  you need swedish citizenship to join the military , become a police officer etc. 
  even if you adjust for inflation , the amount of money bavaria spent on it is several times the amount they got out of it . 
  the reason they bring forward is that generally the sums have exploded compared to what they were the first decades of the l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich . 
  it 's not fair to compare berlin with other capitals . 
  berlin is doing economically worse than the average of germany while being in a region that is even worse economically . 
  carrying around guns and enven using them in defense escalates situations that would n't have ended deadly otherwise . 
  so you can still see some differences in western europe and that it 's not just in one colour, 
  it 's not even gun ownership that is the factor in it but gun culture . 
  for instance a gun is not seen as something you take with you as a normal person to defend yourself in europe , while in some parts of america that is accepted . 
  lol , reddit is a big nuclear circlejerk that totally ignores that newly built nuclear energy is overly expensive . 
  large part of the costs for nuclear are classical construction which have exploded throughout the decades and will further rise . 
  meanwhile costs for renewables are continuing to drop . 
  the statutory feed-in compensation for photovoltaics in germany is lower than that for larger installations and all wind is cheaper than that , including subsidies . 
  franconia as part of the czech republic ? 
  i would n't complain . 
  we share a love for beer ( more than the bavarians ) . 
  when i was in prague i felt more reminded of franconian cities like w\u00fcrzburg and bamberg than when i was in munich . 
  i agree that religions are often abused to justify despicable things . 
  for instance bush said that god told him to invade iraq in a holy crusade , which probably had worse effects than all terrorist attacks in europe combined . 
  while i 'm also pretty sceptical to religions , i think the more important factor is that those extremists work with hate . 
  we should try to get over that hate and show an alternative moral model based on humanist values . 
  fearing it and taking it serious are two different things . 
  the former does not make sense , the latter makes sense . 
  mainstream islam does n't allow for terrorism , the problem is extremist groups like isis . 
  yes , fuck people for living under oppressive regimes and in war regions , where it 's impossible for them to get papers . 
  also there were around 60 million european refugees during wwii : http://www.jstor.org/stable/142127?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents, 
  weckle and kipfle are not the same . 
  weckle are round shaped and kipfle are more long and oval . 
   more in line with truth and reality ? 
   express.co.uk are you kidding me ? 
  there 's also nature and no people in the inland of southern sweden ( except sk\u00e5ne , but that 's practically denmark ) . 
  for instance [ hylte kommun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hylte_municipality ) has 10 inhabitants/km \u00b2 . 
  greenland left the eu while being part of denmark . 
  germans abroad do n't get as drunk as scandinavians abroad . 
  when they see the alcohol prices here they start to throw around money, 
  did you read the article ? 
  the * first * sentence is :  members of the public in european states including france , belgium , germany and the uk greatly ** overestimate ** their country 's ** muslim population ** and the ** rate at which it is growing ** . 
  handled the minimum wage issue ? 
  you mean she let the spd implement the idea of die linke as part of the coalition contract ? 
  i agree that change needs to come slowly and steadily , but merkel is just pushing needed changes away from her . 
  the refugee thing and nuclear exit were the only thing she really decided . 
  everything else was just minimal changes that allow problems to be pushed away further down . 
  there : http://osm.org/go/0cujprwiv -- it 's part of the villa pariani in val di sogno i 've been there just a few weeks ago and got some help from a local locating it again . 
  nah , the risk of butter has been greatly exaggerated and overestimated . 
  coronary artery disease is twice as common in greece than in france and around as common as in germany . 
  ftfy :  - for every 300 people ( i count with 0,33 % as average ) we bring in from mena countries , there will be one of them ** accused ** of rape or sexual assault  - for every 5 000 ukranians ( 0,02 % ) we bring in , there will be one of them ** accused ** of rape or sexual assault . 
  3.7 % of asylum applicants from morocco were accepted : http://www.zeit.de/politik/2016-02/asyl-abschiebung-marokko-deutschland-fluechtlinge, 
  please read this article about the universality of human rights before you write such nonsense : http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/pages/whatarehumanrights.aspx, 
  that would be abolishing human rights . 
  a better leader tries to get other countries on board to stem the crisis together . 
   in the first safe country they enter . 
  this rule is pretty much undoable and only held up powerful countries that do n't want to take any responsibility to take care of a human crisis such as syria . 
  lebanon can not stem every syrian alone . 
  greece and italy can not stem everyone coming over to europe alone . 
  such a catastrophe that she 's upholding germany 's constitution , which enshrines the right to asylum, 
  also some people also go back again . 
  probably the comment was changed in this regard ( you can see with the star ), 
  when solving this , it 's important to remember that for e.g. 
  political refugees it might still be dangerous to go back to those countries . 
  so there are legitimate refugees from those countries . 
  czech beer is better than the beer in many parts of germany , like the north . 
  then you have good regions like franconia that have a rather similar beer culture to czechia . 
  treating germany as a whole beer-wise does not make much sense . 
  i had some meji meltykiss in china ( originally japanese , but was even produced in china ) and it was extremely nice . 
  your own freedom stops where the freedom of others is touched : if you see someone lying on the floor injured you have to do first aid . 
  it 's the same with vaccination : you 're helping people that can not get vaccinated and those where the vaccines do not work . 
  those countries might be failed states that are not able to take responsibility of the criminals correctly or countries that refuse to take them back . 
  all this disregarding that it 's just normal to have the juridical process at the place where the crime was committed . 
  is n't a good thing of states to take responsibility of criminals ? 
  one of the manchester attackers was convicted in italy but just kicked out . 
  that 's what is happening if you kick criminals out : they continue being criminal somewhere else . 
  was in a caf\u00e9 in china where they had a game that i liked . 
  my ex ordered it and it was there the next day for 2.50 $ . 
  not the shipping , but the game + shipping . 
  i was seriously impressed . 
  i count 29 countries with more than 75 % renewables : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources, 
  hydropower has a extremely high percentage in some countries . 
  nowhere in the world nuclear provides 100 % . 
  basically the whole photovoltaics industry came into the existence while olkiluoto 3 was being built ( and it 's still not done ) . 
  renewables are deployable way faster and if you look to hinkley point c even cheaper . 
  nuclear takes decades to build , so it 's not viable for urgent changes . 
  and hey we 're now joining in germany . 
  low interest rates gets people to `` invest '' by buying existing buildings . 
  this leads to an constant increase in prizes which attracts even more `` investors '' . 
  and who has to pay ? 
  people paying rent . 
  you forgot the reason that with greek lying at the periphery , far away from the [ blue banana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) . 
  most places in the periphery struggle , including eastern germany . 
  the exception are countries still catching up economically and resource-rich scandinavia ( wood , minerals and metals make up a big part of [ sweden 's exports ] ( http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/stacked/export/swe/all/show/1995.2014.2/ ) and even more so of [ finland 's exports ] ( http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/stacked/export/fin/all/show/1995.2014.2/ ) ) . 
  i think 4 companies were preselected for a bidding process that decided how much of the spectrum they get . 
  bigger countries have extremely expensive frequencies . 
  e.g 50.8 billion euro in germany for the 3g frequencies which is over 600 euros per inhabitant : https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/versteigerung_der_umts-lizenzen_in_deutschland they have to make back that money and also finance the expensive infrastructure . 
  how they are doing that is artificially limiting things like internet traffic . 
  the alternative is also not really nice : no cheap mobile plans anymore and everyone has to pay a high monthly price to have a mobile phone . 
  just deporting criminals is a problem . 
  the third terrorist was kicked out of italy because he was criminal there . 
  that 's what happens when you kick criminals out : they are committing crimes just somewhere else, 
  i had those cards slipped on the floor through the door of my hotel room daily in china . 
  i was a bit surprised when i saw such cards lying on the ground in stockholm though . 
  yes , in a thread where the ills of saudi-arabia being worse than iran 's is discussed , bringing up issues against iran that apply to almost all countries active in the middle east is whataboutism,
