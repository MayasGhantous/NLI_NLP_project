so do i. 
  as soon as the last holocaust denier is dead , i can finally shut up and rest in peace . 
  of course i do n't . 
  holocaust deniers should have their teeth kicked in before being sent to jail . 
  this has nothing to do with freedom of speech . 
  mein kampf will be published in 2017 . 
  i do n't appreciate this , but afaik it 's gon na be commented and so forth so that this crap wo n't reach the reader without the historical context . 
  this is my opinion . 
  i have never given a flying fuck about political correctness in the last years and i am not gon na start it now . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labskaus ) looks terrible , tastes awesome . 
  they 're gon na miss their macaroni ... just wait until they are introduced to ( drum roll !, 
  ) : [ labskaus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/labskaus.jpg ) !, 
  your post / comment left me flabbergasted ...  in order to solve their own demographic problem so our plan is to use the refugees as ( cheap ) workers and make them fill our pension fund . 
  [ ] laugh [ ] cry [ x ] try not to hit keyboard with head  should they be forced to compensate other countries ... good one , op . 
  make germany pay until we toss our cookies . 
  [ ] laugh hysterically [ ] cry in a fetal position [ x ] ignore  asking for merkel to be impeached yep . 
  that 's gon na solve everything . 
  refugees will find homes , kids wo n't drown in the mediterranean anymore , syria will be a paradise , and we all live in a yellow submarine . 
  [ ] consider to get piss drunk tonight , just because [ ] leave / r / for good [ x ] waste time commenting this bullshit / rant, 
  i want to point out that * bild * is not a very serious source . 
  let 's wait for other and more reliable articles . 
  next march ? 
  man , you are really planning ahead , are n't you ? 
  nobody here knows what the next weeks will be like , soo ... too soon . 
   so far , almuradi 's petition has over 250 signers . 
  cheers , folks . 
  i agree . 
  wo n't be long ... right . 
   just got ta wait and see . 
  not the best concept . 
  we better be prepared in order to avoid a complete catastrophe ... 
  [ i like it ... ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/xtitnnylhqibzkaezu/giphy.gif ), 
  we 're not . 
  the persons behind this crime do not represent my country . 
  i know this village . 
  it 's not very far away from the town where i was born . 
  everything about this dastard crime makes me sick . 
  ouch . 
  he looks so happy . 
  they just told him that the coffee is on the house ... 
  they have special offers from the bigger german cities to london etc. 
  once you 've crossed the channel , take british railways . 
  that would be my plan . 
  german article [ here ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2015/27/griechenland-zukunft-brief-referendum ) . 
  there was a typo in this article . 
  the author has corrected it ( together with the wrong date as / u/cellularized pointed out ) . 
  now that 's interactive journalism here ... 
  it 's cologne - ** bonn ** . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  but history taught me to see where fear mongering begins . 
  and the horrible outcome . 
  right . 
  i live in one of germany 's biggest cities . 
  are * muslims * trying to kill me ? 
  are they raising the isis flag over the houses they live in ? 
  of course not . 
  they are trying to raise their kids , go to work , are upset if their favorite soccer teams loses and so forth . 
  and some of them are scared that some lunatics might harass their loved ones * because they are muslims * . 
  how do i know ? 
  well , i actually talk to my neighbors . 
  no matter if they are russian , turkish , german , greek , polish , * younameit * . 
  and so it begins ... 
  muslims \u2260 terrorists . 
  these cartoons serve one purpose : fear mongering . 
  not very helpful these days . 
  i married into a german/greek family . 
  no one there cares about the awful past ; they actually despise this kind of humor . 
  among all my greek friends and relatives there is a huge lack of understanding on these distasteful cartoons . 
  comparing today 's germany / germans with nazi butchers does n't add very much to the big picture . 
   tatarinstev blamed souring swedish-russian relations on a media campaign in which `` russia is often described as an attacker who only thinks of conducting wars and threatening others '' . 
  i wonder why ... 
  well , so do i. 
  not that good , but it 's sufficient - i guess . 
  not the best example . 
  let 's call a truce , mate . 
  i 've had kidney pie when i was in your beautiful country . 
  excuse me ? 
  please let me know what * exactly * great britain adds to the big picture ... or am i misinformed about the so called brexit ? 
  sneaky ... 
  close , but not touching : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_nauseam, 
  no , i do n't throw up because someone asks for better border controls . 
  but taking a closer look at your comment history makes me chuckle ... 
  first thing i saw this morning while browsing spiegel.de - i almost had to throw up my coffee . 
  ca n't wait to see these clowns fail in the most epic way . 
  the ones opposing ttip always pointed out that shit like this is gon na happen . 
  now what ? 
  common ground will be sacrificed for shareholder 's value . 
  you 're gon na have serious fun . 
  shortest : ja . 
  plot twist : welfare office was closed that day . 
  very interesting indeed . 
  although i do n't think that us is less interested in europe . 
  ttp is on the way . 
  a healthy partnership between these powerful economies is pretty essential for both sides . 
  world wide energy problems have to be solved . 
  i wish i could stop laughing right now ... 
  let 's have a look at what we got here : ~ 2 dozen attention whores on bikes who could n't even manage to provide proper travel documents . 
  furthermore , let 's see who they are  `` for the first time we showed resistance to the global satanism , the growing savagery of western europe , the rush to consumerism that denies all spirituality , the destruction of traditional values , all this homosexual talk , this american democracy .
