  congratulations , europe , for going totally bananas . 
  this is not a russian tank battalion . 
  just a bunch of bikers with questionable ideas . 
  keep in mind what happened to hamc in germany . 
  well , i did . 
  because of kenan malik being the author . 
  his books * quest for a moral compass * and * from fatwa to jihad * are sure worth reading . 
  nevertheless , he 's writing for a us paper . 
  so there should be at least a little note on us politics . 
  refugees are a global problem . 
  [ good one , us . 
  good one indeed . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexico%e2%80%93united_states_border ), 
   nobody is demonstrating in favour of a deal . 
  guess why ? 
  distance : 100 meter . 
  wrong ammo is [ part of the problem ] ( http://www.all4shooters.com/de/inhalte/pro-zone/heckler-und-koch-g36-werksbesuch-caliber-pro-zone/ ) , yes . 
  germany : haha . 
  that 's a known issue of the g36 . 
  h&k have been denying this ever since . 
  [ tests ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-tests-bestaetigen-praezisions-maengel-an-g36-a-1026275.html ) have shown that the inaccuracy can be up to 50 cm . 
  michael mannheimer is known as a right-wing extremist blogger . 
  let 's record this as bullshit . 
   they have to think of russia as germany 's mexico bullshit . 
  he either has a sick sense of humor or is an asshole . 
  he might be completely retarded as well . 
  nevertheless , you should take a close look upon your `` facebook friends '' . 
  article about * german americans * [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_american ), 
  i wonder if somebody can help me fix that dang ikea lamp ... 
  pretty fine , thanks . 
  weekend 's ahead - just a few more hours .

  am i supposed to : [ ] laugh [ ] cringe [ ] throw up or what ? 
  less than 1 euro per hour ?? 
  dude ... 
   yet i get downvoted as crazy -4 points ... cool down . 
  could be worse . 
   i should probably state that i 'm not even european by blood , would that help ? 
  nope . 
  from the article :  a man is quoted : '' i am syrian , you must treat me kindly . 
  mrs. merkel has invited me . '', 
  thanks . 
  i 'm * much * calmer now . 
   and will take great pride in doing so . 
  what ? 
   there is a certain pressure to develop social competencies in ireland that is n't elsewhere . 
  til . 
  thanks . 
   `` i would have loved to hear your presentation in english . '', 
  nice . 
  i 've been working with an irishman when i was a croupier . 
  top-notch ... 
  your german is almost perfect . 
  how come ? 
  are you irish ? 
  some of them were identified as known petty crooks . 
  that means : these arseholes have been living here for quite a while . 
   ( as a munich resident , i think we just send them to cologne ) what ? 
  easy here . 
  police is still investigating . 
  so i 'd like to forbear from untimely assignments of guilt . 
  that includes police bashing . 
  as a cologne resident , i 'm * very * curious how the situation will be handled . 
  right . 
  can receive mail . 
  can see comments . 
  did i fix reddit ? 
  edit : i can even upvote . 
  test post . 
  please ignore, 
  not quite sure if * headache * points to right direction . 
  turkey . 
  warns . 
  now * that 's * what i call an escalation ... 
  mr erdogan [ says a lot ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18584872 ) ... 
  pragmatism . 
  that 's the word to define his work . 
  i 'll miss his comments . 
  it once was a very good idea ... 
   the heart hath no spell-check . 
  indeed . 
  just pointing out that there 's no need to go completely bananas about the whole situation . 
  i ca n't remember * protests * , but a huge solidarity . 
  and folks * helping * , not torching homes for people seeking asylum ... 
   tatjana festerling , ... suggested that the state of saxony should split from the rest of germany . 
  our country tore down the wall brick by brick . 
  now we have `` politicians '' thick as a brick . 
  oh , germany ... 
  let 's see what we got : there 's hardly any authoritative forecast . 
  each and every yokel can name the * problems * , but if one asks for * solutions * : / thread furthermore : we see increasing criminal acts towards the weakest . 
  all of a sudden , the * scared and concerned people * are able * to do something * , even it is the wrong thing . 
  it 's time to lift your ass , deutscher michel . 
  go out and help the ones who need your help . 
  do n't rely on politicians . 
  oh , by the way : some ** 3 million ** east-germans flooded into the west of our country when the borders were opened . 
  i ca n't remember any protests against them . 
  i 'm not a friend of siggy pop as well , but this form of protest is just tacky . 
  that little fuck may be able to botch some gallows , but ca n't spell the name of mr gabriel . 
  it 's * sigmar * .
