well pregnancy is 9 months . 
  this means his wife was in 4th month when they flew . 
  i was reading this and thought : i 've just read that . 
  took me a couple moments to realise this is the translated version . 
  well its really really hard to stay informed in germany nowadays . 
  the level of our media is sinking drastically, 
  its sooo sad that the npd is actually sounding more reasonable than our government right now . 
  yes i know that those claims are far away from what they would do , if they had the power to do so . 
  i just dont know enought about his domestic politic to write something about that . 
  this is why i didnt mention it . 
  thanks for telling me . 
  during the first 2 he wasnt in charge . 
  between the second and the 3rd he started wars against austria , uk , italy and so on . 
  so no , you can not blame him for starting the war , but you can blame him for provoking it . 
  the reason those other monarchs are not dictators is because dictatorship means to get a monarch-like status in something that is supposed to be a democracy . 
  the difference is that a monarch gets to be monarch because his father was monarch . 
  a dictoator climbs the `` throne '' himself , while still keeping the farce of a democracy . 
   a dictator ? 
  what do you call the monarchs he was fighting against ? 
  why dont you call him an emperor ? 
  he was a dictator if you like it or not , if you dont believe me , use google . 
  i know he is somewhat of a national hero for you guys and this might be hard to crasp , but this still doesnt change the fact . 
   so you 're telling me that he isnt the one who started the war ? 
  if my information is right , he isnt the one that started the war against the third coalition . 
  but he went to war against parts of those coalition again and again , plus at the time he prepared an army to invade the uk . 
   napoleon was a general who fought for his country [ ... ] well first , napolon was a dictator as was hitler . 
  napoleon brought about as much war over europe as did hitler . 
  when it came to war , napoleon was even worse than hitler . 
  but as far as i know napoleon didnt slaughter minorities , like hitler and stalin did . 
  but then again , thats nothing that i ever looked into . 
  the biggest thing about napoleon is , that his time is long past . 
  hitler was in recent history, 
  if you want it or not , napoleon was a dictator . 
  a dictator that started many wars and won land from wars . 
  ( for example against austria , uk , italy ) . 
  at one point napoleon raised an army to attack england . 
  before he attacked , britain , austria and i think it was russia or so , declared war on france . 
  i mean there is a reason they are called napoleonic wars . 
  napoleon can not be held responsible for all of this alone , but neither can hitler for ww2 . 
  look at those 2 links , the amount of people killed was insane for this time . 
  plus if there was a way for this to become a world war , it would have been one . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleonic_wars_casualties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_population#population_growth_by_region plus historicans really like to compare him with hilter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon#criticism, 
  napoleon was hitler in a time where worldwars were just not possible . 
  with the difference that napoleon actually had some tactical sense . 
  ( well atleast until he invaded russia ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon#criticism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleonic_wars_casualties the population in europe in 1800 was about 203million . 
  the napoleonic wars killed up to 6m thats about 3 % of europes polulation for comparison , ww2 killed about 3 % of the world polulation . 
  the difference is , there was still stalin and the china-japan war . 
  so yes . 
  its totally fine to mention napoleon along side hitler , even if he might not have been that bad !, 
  black death thirty years ' war napoleon hitler sorted by time not how bad they were, 
   you can easily produce another hitler who will kill millions of people in the name of political corectness . 
  not really . 
  if our system would ban anything that isnt political correct , extremists will flourish . 
  this is obviously bad !, 
  what we are banning are those texts that call for murdering people and burning their homes . 
  and newsflash , this isnt just a boogeyman , this actually happens . 
  now speaking about the boogeyman , as far as i know , there are no syrian immigrants that reed those texts ( in german ) before they come to germany thus this effect is completly useless . 
  some years a go , a lunatic wrote a book . 
  everyone said this is just a bogyman . 
  well turns out , ` mein kampf ' was pretty serious . 
  now the main prinziple behind hitler is this indefensible scapegoat , back then i was the jews . 
  they were bad integrated and just easy to use , plus hitler hat personal history with them . 
  their integration status was not completly their own fault , but it was bad anyway . 
  now we have one problem , how do we make people the scapegoat using only political correct statements . 
  i just dont see it . 
  you are right , this is the way those regimes start but it only works if you stir up the crowds . 
   making bodily threats , etc. 
  bodily threats as in :  i will kill you ** allowed **  i will wait at your parents house , if you ever come there again i will shoot you on the spot !, 
  ** again this is allowed **  tomorrow morning at noon i will break into your house and stap you to death using my kitchen knife now this is illigal cause i specified exactly how it will kill you and when . 
  in germany all of them are illegal but facebook just doesnt care . 
  so we created our own system to delete those comments . 
   ... but are you allergic to different opinions or something ? 
  not at all , the article just read that way and i didnt really like the way this article tried to argument . 
  as i said , as a german i have nothing against regulation of hatespeach , call it censorship if you want . 
  this article is based on the idea that any regulation/censoring of free speech must not happen . 
  i just hope they dont start to censor stuff that is not hatespeech but against their politcal attitude, 
  this seems like an rightwing , american article . 
  in germany we think alot different about free speech than americans do . 
  for us free speech does not include hate speech . 
  this means we value the censorship of hatespeech over another hitler !, 
  murica is alot stonger minded about the ristriciton of rights , for example the right to own your own weapon/aresenal . 
  with preacher men defending this right on a level soo stupid , you could easily confuse them with is preacher men . 
  the problem this article shows , is that a few of those censoring people are far-left . 
  to be fair , this is a problem as they might censor more than they should . 
  but as long as they only censor hatespeach and dont start to censor articles/comments reasoning against immigration on a logical level , i aint have no problem with this . 
  nothing melted or blowed up , they just lost accuracy as they are not designed for perma fire, 
   i mean they use the rifle under much hotter conditions than the german army . 
  von der leyen just wanted a new rifle so she needed to create reasons to abandon the g36 . 
  the tested the g36 in ways that are completly impossible in the field . 
  and are actuall completly impossible when you use the weapon without modifying it . 
  ( using drum mags ) . 
  any assault rifle i know of , would fail under this conditons . 
  i mean the g36 just misfired a bit , most would just jam, 
  yes it is , but the german minister wanted to so something in her career , so decided we need new , better weapons . 
  but convincing the parliament to buy new was impossible as g36 is still on of the best ar out there . 
  so she created artificial reasons ... 
  the setup was completly flawed . 
  in the test they did they put the weapon under conditions that are impossible in the field . 
  like perma firering with a drum mag . 
  every assault rifle i know of , missfires under those conditions .
