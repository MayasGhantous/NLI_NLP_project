  scenario 2 is absolutely horrible for the people of syria . 
  with any of the 3 possible solutions . 
  it also means that many of the refugees wo n't return as there is nothing to return to . 
  scenario 3 is still shit compared to scenario 1 but it is the best solution that is still possible . 
  if you think otherwise . 
  please take a look at the situation in libya and iraq and then take a look at the situation before the war . 
  now compare hussein and gaddafi to al-assad . 
  if you still think the war in syria was something good or reinstating al-assad is bad , please explain to my why you think so . 
  i ca n't see any logical reason . 
  there is a pretty simple solution for that . 
  ** stop starting wars in the middle east !, 
  ** use your political pressure to make sure america is n't starting wars either . 
  stop putting pressure on russia and finally reinstate al-assad . 
  just how fucking stupid are you ? 
  because it 's obviously a super serious post . 
  have you even looked at it ? 
  [ there is actually a video about turning mining operations into lakes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzxrzfcyos ) edit : spelling, 
  this map is total bullshit . 
  this was before the last glacial period . 
  most of the lakes on this map simply didnt exist back then !, 
  this is american . 
  do you really think they got most of it right ? 
  i do n't, 
  was just giving context for the information . 
  as you can see they have no information for germany . 
  at this point in time , all of europe is completely destroyed . 
  so yeah , the living situations where really shitty . 
  so this was published on dec 1 1918 , thus right after ww1 ended . 
  true . 
  as i said . 
  we show our patriotism in other ways . 
  i 'd also never vote germany the least arrogant country cause i know how fucking arrogant i am !, 
  patriotism as in `` i know my land but i see its flaws '' is completely fine . 
  the patriotism we dislike is as in : i love my land . 
  it is perfect so do n't criticize it . 
  only other people of my country are allowed to criticize but please only do it right before the elections . 
  also i need to show my love at every moment that 's why i have a huge flag hanging in front of my house . 
  so basically do n't be an american patriot . 
  i think its more of an brexit thing . 
  i mean al-assad is far more benefiting for the world and syria than trump is . 
  i 'm honestly surprised that there are so few stuid people . 
  i mean only 61 % said that there is someone better than al-assad even tho our media has been less than intelligent while reporting about him . 
  what austrians think of current leaders . 
  leader [ country ] | someone else would do a better job | i do n't know / i have no opinion | no one else could do a better job . 
  --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- christian kern [ austria ] | 28 % | 16 % | 56 % angela merkel [ germany ] | 42 % | 8 % | 50 % wladimir putin [ russia ] | 54 % | 17 % | 29 % alexis tsiprasf [ greece ] | 35 % | 37 % | 28 % viktor orb\u00e1n [ hungary ] | 48 % | 24 % | 28 % theresa may [ gb ] | 33 % | 45 % | 22 % francois hollande [ france ] | 41 % | 37 % | 22 % jean-claude juncker [ eu ] | 48 % | 31 % | 21 % donald trump [ usa ] | 76 % | 13 % | 11 % baschar al-assad [ syria ] | 61 % | 35 % | 4 % recep tayyip erdogan [ turkey ] | 89 % | 9 % | 2 %, 
  it 's interresting that putin is that high . 
  to be honest tho he often seems to make more sense than our political leaders . 
  its also very interesting that only 55 % had an opinion regarding the uk . 
  it 's like : `` i 'm pretty sure someone could do a better job , but i do n't know if the uk has that certain someone '', 
  there is no such thing as a `` holy war '' as a war can not be holy, 
   no one is allowed to kill anyone for his/her god in islam . 
  so at least we agree that suicide bombers are heretics . 
  you may kill in a war situation does n't mean you kill for your god tho . 
  i means you kill for your nation , for your values and because you get killed if you do n't kill . 
  this has nothing to do with god . 
   a martyr ( greek : \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2 , m\u00e1rtys , `` witness '' ; stem \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1 - , m\u00e1rtyr - ) is somebody who suffers persecution and death for advocating , renouncing , refusing to renounce , or refusing to advocate a belief or cause as demanded by an external party . 
  ** this refusal to comply with the presented demands results in the punishment or execution of the martyr by the oppressor . 
  ** how can the last part be true for a soldier on the frontlines . 
  it might be true for prisoners of war who rather die then work for the enemy . 
  but its certainly not true if you die on the battlefield . 
  a person who thinks he is killing for his god is a heretic . 
  this is not only islam , this is also for all the crusaders, 
  i believe in the same god as you . 
  but a martyr is someone who died for his believes . 
  they did n't attack you because you were moslem . 
  they attacked because this was a war . 
  so by the simple definition of martyrdom they cant be martyrs . 
   1915 turkish gallipoli martyrs . 
  there are no such things as battlefield martyrs gallipoli was one of the worst battlefield in history with stupid generals on both sides . 
  calling soldiers matyrs is one of the most stupid things you can do . 
  thats what i said . 
  maybe they want to improve on their own . 
  maybe what they learn in state schools isnt ( fast ) enough for them . 
  thats why i put the edit in there . 
  true , it wasnt the most intelligent answer i gave today xd, 
  ~ ~ nope in a good immigration system . 
  there are language courses for every immigrant . ~ ~ edit : i mean not only the children , but the adults aswell . 
  edit2 : i fucked up my first sentence thus i put an edit in there trying to clarify . . 
  i think i 've confused people even more . 
  well they should be learning it in state schools . 
  it might be that they want to improve on their own tho . 
  in which case  or maybe its the immigration system working for them in unexpected ways . 
  or maybe its the immigration system failing them ... or maybe its the immigration system working for them in unexpected ways . 
  drink less ... or more, 
  may be because i 'm not a native speaker . 
  i think i understood something like `` there 's nothing to talk about it '' . 
  i think it sounded like they do n't even have to try as there is no chance . 
  i know its completly wrong . 
  and after reading it 3 or 4 times i get the correct meaning . 
  it just confused me the first time . 
  the title threw me off for a second . 
  after reading it the first time , it sounded like it a scot eu membership would be hard . 
  the clip told us its extremely easy for the scots to join . 
  i hope a mod can add a tag to this to make this more clear . 
  edit : spelling, 
  yes . 
  cause he knows exactly that europe wo n't do anything . 
  you can be intelligent and fuck up from time to time . 
  there is no such thing as collective amnesia . 
  but there is control of information .
