  calling a chrome book linux is like calling android linux . 
  sure its the same core but its not like your average user will use a chromebook . 
  also i have yet to see one being used . 
  yes i know cinnamon . 
  i tried it and still decided to go back . 
  and now you can tell me all you want that i simply do n't have enough experience with linux and it is because i am soo used to windows and so forth . 
  i have used linux for over a year on my working pc . 
  things will change with games on linux . 
  yeah and then hopefully linux will evolve into a version where the ui actually does n't suck . 
  a version that your average `` joe '' can use without opening the terminal once . 
  what i am telling you is that desktop linux has many many flaws so stop trying to convince people to switch just because you dislike windows . 
  your os is not your religion and no one likes missionaries, 
   when he created linux he was a european . 
  touch\u00e9 i tried linux for quite a while . 
  its was n't working very well . 
  the windows ( and osx ) ui is just a lot better . 
  when you do everything on console then linux is better , no argument about that , if you want a usefull ui use windows or osx ( even tho it pains me to acknowledge apple here ) . 
  if you want to talk about the average joe then you got to accept that he will be unable to use linux cause linux is hell if you are not tech savvy . 
  nearly no one will switch os to play games or use other programs that simply do n't run on linux . 
   linux distros are free and can do 90 % of people 's needs . 
  and those 10 % are the reason no one is using linux on desktop . 
  whats the linux marketshare ? 
   and i am platform agnostic , i do n't care what operating system you use then why are you telling people to switch ? 
   and also , linux is objectively better for developers nope . 
  source i 'm a dev . 
  torvalds is an american by choice . 
  do n't call him european , even if he was born here . 
  why would anyone in their right mind use linux on a destop pc that makes like zero sense . 
  there are things that linux is a lot better at than windows . 
  ui is not one of those . 
  linux is best used on a server and accessed by console . 
  ( yes that server can be at home , no dont use the windows console , cause the windows console is really really bad ), 
  i hate it . 
  it makes them incredible arrogant and it will one day be their downfall . 
  most likely go the front like anyone else and then try to find a way to come home . 
  my grandpa for example became a driving instructor . 
  ^ ^ my ^ ^ other ^ ^ grandpa ^ ^ went ^ ^ to ^ ^ syberia ^ ^ for ^ ^ 7 ^ ^ years . 
  ^ ^ that ^ ^ was ^ ^ his ^ ^ way ^ ^ of ^ ^ getting ^ ^ away ^ ^ from ^ ^ the ^ ^ front ^ ^ / s, 
  im talking about those who sued to boy for pointing out a flaw in their security . 
  and it was not a joke . 
  and yes this is coming from a german guy . 
  no all the flak should be directed at bkk and t-systems . 
  they both deserve it equally, 
  god god this is retarded . 
  i hope all those assholes responsible for this loose their job and go to jail . 
  i know its not going to happen . 
  all they get is a bonus . 
  those are the `` people '' who would have willingly worked at a kz in the past . 
  well less shit is still shit . 
  as i said , apologizing would be the right thing to do and it would help the image a lot more than fixing the problem while praising yourself for it . 
  thanking them for this move would be wrong as they simply did what has to be expected . 
  honestly they should apologize for that scam . 
  true , i 'm stupid xd, 
  the problem is that it is very hard to know wether this is a one of those circumstances or not . 
   etwas anderes k\u00f6nnte dann gelten , wenn die ver\u00f6ffentlichung gerade des kfz-kennzeichens erkennbar darauf abzielte , dem antragssteller hierdurch zu sch\u00e4digen so this person is switching lanes without indicating it . 
  i know its a silly example . 
  and you are totally right normally there wont be a problem . 
  but you never know . 
  somewhere in the bgb . 
  it does n't say explicitly that you can not make pictures of the car . 
  its more about property and personal rights . 
  its not like this picture will ever get you a fine , even if the owner finds it and wants it removed . 
  that is unless the owner is some protected person . 
  they would not use a flashy numberplate like this so it is completely rhetorical . 
  you can see in the picture that this guy is chancing lanes and he does not seem to be indicating this . 
  so the owner could say that he does n't want a picture of him doing this online . 
  if there is a way to link the owner to the car then there would be a good chance of him winning in front of court . 
  it is not illegal from the beginning but it has the chance to be so . 
  and now take everything i said with a grain of salt as i am neither a lawyer nor a law student . 
  i have talked with law students about similar things so every thing i said is second hand at best . 
  i really hope this is sarcasm coming from an american . 
  source please i have seen that the map is from the washington post . 
  i would like to know where the data is from, 
  fyi it is actually illegal to post screenshots of number plates online . 
  if you are looking for girls then i would look somewhere else . 
  ( source living there ) . 
  if you are looking for guys i can not really give you information . 
  never said anything about avoiding . 
  just do n't make them your focus or you are going to hate you time in belgium . 
  i do n't think europe will be that happy if germans start driving tanks through the ardennes again . 
  duplicate pictures and wtf is picture 4 . 
  please cleanup and repost, 
  belgium is really pretty as long as you do n't count the roads . 
  yup . 
  that shows it pretty well :d you have seen a lot of belgium tho . 
  i mean its not like i have seen everything in germany , yet i have seen germany . 
  but if you have only seen the big cities than you have not seen the country :d, 
  the one we threatened to do . 
  not just saying we will talk about it . 
  `` simply '' make sure the eu stops paying them money . 
  a reisewarnung for turkey seams plasible . 
  so add turkey to [ this list ] ( http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/laenderinformationen/01-reisewarnungen-liste_node.html ) already . 
  swabia & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ good ^ ^ ^ ^ fun, 
  he is absolutely right . 
  its the time for actions , not threats . 
   `` the eu should support turkey during this difficult period in the region by understanding the reasons for the fight against terrorism , by providing visa liberalization and especially by accelerating the accession process , '' \u00c7elik said . 
  this is the essence of the talk . 
  its pretty much continue to pay us money we will not change shit tho . 
  so where is this not correct ? 
  i mean the fact that she lost her position is so obvious i did n't even think it was worth mentioning .
