  maybe you are right and you could call your parties would be coalitions in our system . 
  in your system they are unions of parties . 
  this means they are interlocked in a never chancing state . 
  if they were all separate parties , there would be coalitions of parts of the democrats and parts of the republicans as democrats and republicans have a pretty huge intersection . 
  this would already make a quite a difference as it will force many hardliners into the opposition . 
  edit : i pressed enter too early  the taliban terrorist network was founded by the pakistani intelligence service . 
  and the us did n't create isis , unless you mean the way batman created the joker . 
  [ from wikipedia taliban ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taliban#beginnings )  when muhammad zia-ul-haq became president of pakistan , he feared that the soviets were planning to invade balochistan , pakistan , so he sent akhtar abdur rahman to saudi arabia , to garner support for the afghan resistance against soviet occupation forces . 
  ** in the meantime , the united states ** and saudi arabia ** joined the struggle against the soviet union by providing all the funds ** . 
  this is what america has been doing for quite some time . 
  providing extremists with funds to fight their enemies . 
  then at some point they loose control of the monster they created . 
  [ about isis read this guardian article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq ) there is a ton of prove that america payed `` the resistance '' in syria and supplied them with weapons . 
  many of those extremist forces united with al-qaeda ( another american creation ) to form isis . 
  america did n't completely set up any terror organization , they just looked for promising extremists and payed them in money and weapons until they did n't need american money anymore and went haywire . 
  was more of a joke anyway . 
  i like the strikethrough more then simple editing as well :d, 
  fast edit it . 
  no one will notice xd, 
   we 're both shouting at the mirror . 
  take my upvote for this small sentence . 
   no doubt you believe you 're fully justified in judging yourselves culturally , politically and morally superior to us . 
  ** culturally : ** well our culture is much older but that 's about it . 
  it ai n't superior , its just different . 
  ** morally : ** humans are the same . 
  the only difference in moral comes from culture and politic . 
  i do n't think the european people are morally superior to american people . 
  ( might be different for politicians tho ) ** politically : ** yes i actually think we are politically superior to you . 
  * from now on i 'm only talking about germany as i just do n't have the knowledge for other eu countries * . 
  our politics are far away from perfect . 
  as i said before , we stand behind you in every war you wage . 
  our industry sadly has enormous influence on our politics , specially the automobile industry ( what you call diesel-gate is standard for us ) . 
  we get election gifts every 4 years that make our over-complex system even more complex . 
  we nearly never speak up against americas will . 
  our constitution has a real big problem . 
  it 's getting outdated . 
  the big problem is that a constitution is written by mortal men . 
  no man can see the future and predicting the future for more than 50 years is extremely difficult . 
  our constitution is turning 68 this year and the gaps are clearly noticeable . 
  in my opinion we need to rework our constitution every 50 years or so . 
  and now we come to the one big problem with the us . 
  your constitution is soon turning 230 and it shows . 
  the guys who wrote your constitution where geniuses as you constitution was up to date for about 100 years . 
  a change was long overdue by the end of ww2 and by now its just a disaster . 
  let 's be honest here . 
  your presidential election system is far from democratic . 
  it 's practically only possible for rich people to be elected ( or if you have a very rich backer ) . 
  most of your politicians spend half of the day begging for money which has gruesome influence on their `` opinions '' . 
  you do n't have real options in your election , you always have to choose the lesser evil of democrats or republicans . 
  a third , fifth or twentieth party just has no chance to survive . 
  political coalitions is something that could balance your politics , but it can simply not exist within your presidential system . 
  the electoral college was a good idea when there was no way to efficiently communicate with people from the other end of america , by now its just a sad reminder of what should have been changed long ago . 
  i could go on for quite some while here , but i already wrote far too much . 
  i hope you get my point tho . 
  i 'm not saying we are perfect , i 'm just saying we are less fucked than you guys are :d, 
  what we hate america for is their arrogance on their imaginary morale superiority and their idea that they somehow protect us . 
  its simple fact that america is the shadiest warmonger in the world . 
  america has been at war for  90 % of its existence . 
  their defense strategy is to wage war in the world to make sure that war does n't come close to their borders . 
  who do you think created the taliban ? 
  who do you think created al-qaeda ? 
  who do you think created isis ? 
  you create wars all over the world and yet you refuse to take the refugees you are responsible for . 
  and yet americans have the nerves to talk about moral superiority !, 
  [ shame ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utyzs46enc4 ) you ai n't protecting europe for shit . 
  lets be honest here . 
  if russia would be using atomic weapons on europe you would n't fire back . 
  yes you have army bases in europe but those are mainly for convenience reasons . 
  its just closer to the middle east . 
  it also makes sure the eu can never turn on you . 
  yes you helped us a lot with the marshall plan . 
  you helped to build us up again . 
  but let 's be honest . 
  we have repaid that debt many times by now . 
   we completly re-wrote the the handbook on international relations , [ . . ] into creating dictators and terror regimes . 
  let 's be honest here . 
  the cold war just fucked with the planes everyone . 
  no one expected atomic weapons before they existed  [ . . ] previously dominated by colonialism & imperial client states , to the point that the very idea of that is now alien & unthinkable to you . 
  we matured into democracy . 
  something you guys have still before you . 
  speaking of client states tho . 
  this is exactly what the middle east was for you . 
  america and the soviet union created dictators all around the world . 
  what else do you think they are ? 
  germany lost their colonies due to the loss of the first and second world war . 
  the uk lost their colonies because of globalization . 
  those nations grew up and became independent . 
  the wars of the past became impossible due to nuclear weapons and the cold war . 
  its not that you guys re-wrote the art of politics . 
  we just stopped to rage war for no reason . 
  you didnt ' !, 
  its pretty close tho . 
  we hate america aswell < 3, 
  true . 
  still that does n't change anything . 
  i do and thats the point im trying to make here . 
  what they do is against their self interrest !!, 
   many on the far-right actually want to adopt isolationism and leave the me the hell alone . 
  did you even read what i wrote ? 
  thats exactly the point why they are gaining votes .
