  when we `` leave the me the hell alone '' we wo n't have a fking refugee crisis and we wo n't even need isolationism . 
   unfortunately you are wrong about this . 
  quite a large number of people follow war mongers and big mouths , because they want to be part of it that is true for america no question . 
  i 'm talking about european politicians here . 
  our politicians loose from the refugee crisis and they would gain from opening their mouths and opposing war mongering . 
  but they do n't . 
  america is not paying for the consequences . 
  we are . 
  the economical pressure from america ca n't be that huge that our politicians risk loosing their power . 
  actualyl thats the only thing you can do . 
  convince your politicians . 
  i do n't talk like all of you brits choose to go to war . 
  i talk like all of our politicians . 
  not just the uk but the rest of europe as well choose to start a war in the middle east . 
  and now we suffer the consequences . 
  the far right is on the rise cause `` we '' ( as in our states ) think its a good idea to follow the us into every fking human rights violation there could possible be . 
   not a single house in the us main land has been bombed in ww1 , ww2 , and all the wars that followed since . 
  which means that they can destroy other economies and industry , grab whatever they want and walk away without consequences . 
  yes it ruins a couple of gi lives but that 's small potatoes . 
  the profits are immense . 
  i know that . 
  but why are the europeans helping them ? 
  i do n't understand that . 
  cause we are the idiots who have to suffer the consequences . 
  it 's also very bad for every political party to do so as it will loose them a ton of voters . 
  the reasons why europe is helping the us is escaping me . 
  [ for those who have no idea what cap is . 
  ( wiki-artile ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_agricultural_policy ), 
  i do n't think that 's the main problem tho ( at least for any other country than the us ) the war mongering in syria was a political decision that i do n't understand . 
  there are 2 countries taking a profit from this . 
  turkey and israel . 
  america is happy that there is another war for their arms industry and also cause this is their defensive strategy . 
  making sure there is permanently a war and as far away from their borders as possible . 
  they are also happy that there is another government gone with good connections to russia . 
  i do n't see the point for the rest of the world tho . 
  right now all we do is sucking americas cock while having what we call the refugee crisis . 
  i do n't understand what leverage america has on europe to make us go along with something this horrible . 
  it is also very bad for every government as it will make it really hard for them to be reelected . 
  so the real question is . 
  what leverage does america has on our governments . 
  ok . lets start this discussion . 
  let 's look at all scenarios i can think of and compare them . 
  syria before we payed and equipped the rebels ** al-assad would have ruled for another 30 to 40 years . 
  with the right political pressure we could have forced him to step down at 80 . 
  the next generation of government will in itself be more diplomatic than assad was . 
  with the right political pressure on al-assad this could have been an easy success story . 
  al-assad clearly was n't the most democratic leader or the best for his all people . 
  but he was quite good at eradicating religious extremists . 
  syria was a somewhat secular state with a decent living standard for the vast majority of the people . 
  it was stable country in a war torn region . 
  it had decent economical growth and was opening up to the west . 
  it had no discrimination of religions as long as they did n't force it upon other people and the religion did n't work against the state . 
  & nbsp ; ** no2 . 
  syria after we replaced al-assad with a rebel government and the process of doing so . 
  ** first we started by paying and equipping rebels . 
  the rebels who could find where those who had been suffering under al-assad . 
  in other words islamist extremists . 
  and so isis was born . 
  isis and other extremist groups plunged syria into chaos . 
  killing thousands and starting a civil war that would kill hundred thousands and displace millions ( sending millions to europe as well ) . 
  completely destroying their economy and infrastructure in the process . 
  this lead to the rise of groups like the kurds who mainly fight against isis . 
  the kurds and the syrian army are not exactly friends , but they fight their current enemy and usually do n't kill each other . 
  now lets fast forward to the end of the war . 
  the syrian army looses due to interventions by the west . 
  the syrian economy and infrastructure is now totally in ruins . 
  he west will have to back a somewhat democratic , islamist government . 
  turkey will make sure that the kurds have no influence in this government . 
  the kurds obviously wont like this and create their own government . 
  you can be certain that there will be at least one more big group fighting to control syria and there will also be a shit ton of small extremist groups . 
  we now have multiple groups fighting to rule syria . 
  this is a civil war that will last for at least another 10 years . 
  they wo n't have a chance to build up any economy or infrastructure . 
  there wo n't be any first world companies trying to invest into syria as no one will invest into a country that unstable . 
  ** solution 1 ** is that at one point a strong leader will emerge and take over the country . 
  if we are lucky he is a will be a gruel secular dictator . 
  if we are unlucky ( which is much more likely ) he will be a gruel islamist dictator/sheik . 
  it will take him at least 15 years , most likely more to build up the economy to the point where it was before the rebellion . 
  he will a much worse dictator then al-assad is or ever is going to be . 
  this is the solution that would mimic libya . 
  if you ask the people there , most will tell you they want gadaffi back , and he was a much worse dictator than al-assad . 
  ** solution 2 ** is if we put western armies in syria for the next at least 10 years . 
  but i do n't think this will work out with turkey in the neighborhood . 
  it definitely wont if erdogan wins the election . 
  this solution would mimic iraq . 
  still a shitty solution . 
  ** solution 3 ** is turkey invading syria after erdogan becomes dictator . 
  also very likely , even worse for the syrian people tho . 
  & nbsp ; ** no3 . 
  syria when we force the kurds and al-assad to build a new government together ** he will build up the economy again . 
  this will take at least a decade . 
  in the meantime he will try his best to exterminate and islamist . 
  if we reinstate him , we can also force him to step down once he is too old as we have extreme leverage on him . 
  we also do n't need to place armies in syria , but we need to pressure turkey to not invade syria . 
  this is the by far fastest way to stop the war tho . 
  it is also the fastest way to make the country stable enough to encourage many syrians in refugee camps to return . 
  if we pay al-assad money to rebuild his country we will still have to pay less than what we have to pay for for the refugees . 
  this scenario will be the closest to scenario no1 & nbsp ; ** lets compare ** scenario 1 is obviously impossible . 
  we ca n't turn back time . 
  but it also shows us what could have been and what we destroyed with our warmongering .
