yes , people are literally giving us money for free , yet our minister of finance thinks this is a great time to aim for a balanced budget ... when we should be heavily investing to fix our crumbling infrastructure instead . 
  now you 're backpedaling from the previous backpedaling and misrepresenting what i said at the same time . 
  impressive . 
  i acknowledged that reforms are needed , and i specifically did not suggest `` just pumping some borrowed money in '' , that is not the position of any serious critic of the previous ( and as it seems , also the third ) troika 's programmes . 
  i wrote __ investing __ . 
  investments that create lasting value . 
  investments that improve greece 's competitiveness and can generate positive returns . 
  and get money flowing in the greek economy again at the same time . 
  well now you 're backpedaling , that did n't read so moderate in your original post . 
  you painted greece as lazy takers who do n't want to change their ways . 
  and i was saying that a little twitter campaign is nothing compared to the constant storm of comments like yours . 
  as for myself ( and i believe most critics of the `` rescue '' packets of the institutions would agree with me here ) : i never said that reforms in greece are not necessary . 
  they are , but these reforms alone wo n't get greece on a path of growth again . 
  in any economic model , even a neoclassical , if you prefer that one , you need someone to start spending money to get the economic cycle going . 
  if , as in greece , the state , companies and individualls all have to save ( read : try to reduce their expenses ) while their income is shrinking , you get an economic death spiral . 
  someone has to start spending , investing money . 
  but to suggest that is seen as heresy and/or stupid folly . 
  ( `` give those lazy greeks money to spend ?! '' ), 
  if you feel so offended by a little twitter campaign , can you maybe imagine how hurt greeks feel reading ignorant diatribes like yours again and again , even from high-ranking politicians , after their life dreams and ambitions have been shattered by the collapse of their economy ? 
  young people with good educations jobless for years and years , dependent on the pensions of their grandparents to scrape by ? 
  people with treatable illnesses who can not get important medicines because they lost their insurance and the health care system has collapsed ? 
  and you come here and talk as if you just know that it 's their own damn fault , because they 're so lazy and refused to play along the rules , although greece did everything the troika demanded , cut spending , fired thousands and thousands of people , and on and on and on ... you 're incapable of comprehending that our approach was wrong , instead doubling down as if pure determination could make up for an unwillingness to adjust expectations to reality . 
  i only keep my flair in this sub to show people that not all germans are so self-righteous and ignorant . 
  in reality , i 'm becoming ashamed again of my home country and its people . 
  congratulations germany , we managed to initiate europe 's downfall for the third time in a hundred years . 
  germany # 1 , no one can beat us , whoo !, 
  well , the odds to me look like this : grexit : high probability of getting almost nothing paid back deal including debt restructuring : high probability of getting a good part back, 
  okay , point taken . 
  in that case i apologize too , i really did n't get that . 
  more or less the things that varoufakis ( though undiplomatic moron that he is ) has been painted as the devil for : extended hold on the debt repayments ( that is , to be honest , almost the same as another debt cut , because it reduces the present value of the debt ) , financial support for the poorest to alleviate suffering , some kind of eu investment fund to kickstart the greek economy , fighting corruption and tax evasion in greece . 
  it 's all in the proposals he had that he was scolded for . 
  it 's also more or less what the economists signing this letter advocate . 
  of course this could be made conditional with tight monitoring of reform implementations and enforcement of tax discipline . 
  as i said , these are details that would not make or break the deal . 
  but the whole idea of changing the approach to solving the crisis was apparently abhorrent to the creditor institutions . 
  you see that ireland had to reduce its spending by only half as much as greece . 
  the situations of the `` piigs '' coutries was never the same , and they did not get the same treatment . 
  specifically , only greece had in fact a problem with the productivity of its economy and its debt level before the crisis . 
  the other ones only became crisis countries because of their bank bailouts . 
  so the economies were in completely different shape , and so it is no wonder that other countries got on their feet again , while the austerity medicine just made everything worse in greece . 
  and when it did n't work at first , the response was the cut spending even more . 
  so of course greece complains the most . 
  the other countries at least are seeing light at the end of the tunnel . 
  but that is not the fault of the greeks . 
  the rest of your comment , that 's just the same toxic attitude that makes me so sad about this . 
  all these know-it all , holier-than-thou people so sure that the greeks are just bad people who deserve to suffer . 
  as i said , i do n't expect facts to change your view anyway . 
  i do n't know which economists you 're talking about , but i doubt it 's the ones signing this letter . 
  if you do , please provide your `` paper trail '' . 
  i know that at least paul krugman , whom this subreddit also loves to hate , has warned both about the problems with the setup of the eurozone and the housing bubble long before they happened . 
  of course , why not . 
  this is exactyl the sort of thing that syriza has been demanding from the beginning : direct investment in greeces infrastructure , support in going after corruption , and a breather on the debt repayments . 
  the details could be worked out if one could at least agree on such a course of action in principle . 
  but on the creditor side , such things have been branded as rude and heretical demands . 
  that 's exactly what the discussion has been looking like to me for a long time here ... ostensibly rational people , driven by their unacknowledged desire to punish the intransigent greeks for their perceived profligacy and uppity behavior . 
  it goes so far that people would rather see all their spent money lost than to even consider the arguments of the greek government . 
  what you say is true , but not applicable to the current situation . 
  ** now ** the debt has stopped rising and actually started to decline , but the measures demanded by the creditors made the economy shrink so fast that currently the debt can not be paid back . 
  it ** could ** be paid back if the economy is given room to grow again . 
  and that is also in the interest of the creditors like us . 
  well , but there 's a very [ relevant graph ] ( http://imgur.com/iuowko2 ) in it . 
  this shows perfectly how the crash in greece 's economy is the problem right now , not the absolute level of debt . 
  that has been made almost manageable by the haircut and has actually started to decrease . 
  but the ratio of the blue to red lines ( debt/gdp ratio ) has been increasing anyway because the economy is shrinking so much . 
  but here on this sub and elsewhere the rhetoric of `` the money is gone anyway , they could never repay ( and do n't even want to ) , never reformed '' dominates . 
  facts just do n't get through to people .

  three of the five signing economists are european ... 
  but whatever , at least you got to shoot off a dismissive comment without reading the article . 
  then make sure you ( do n't ) go into [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/37k4zu/want_some_noodles/ ) , it 'll make you feel loopy . 
  i just feel so onion-y today ... is it the weather , or lack of sleep ? 
  i swear , a lot of headlines in this sub give me a distinct onion-y feeling today . 
  must be the weather ... 
  it 's purple , not blue . 
  come on , that breakup thing is based purely on speculation from tabloid `` newspaper '' bild !, 
  since they printed a full-page middle finger , could they be forced to print a full-page retraction in case it turns out b\u00f6hmermann is telling the truth ? 
  that would be ** so ** delicious . 
  of course you 'd boldly call out any vagueness , seeing how high hungary scores on masculinity ( assertiveness ) and uncertainty avoidance . 
  fuckin lazy germans . 
  and no , we 're not efficient . 
  proof : am on reddit at work . 
   the october 2016 expert survey of the centre for macroeconomics ( cfm ) and cepr invited views from a panel of macroeconomists based across europe on germany 's trade surplus , its impact on the eurozone economy , and the appropriate response of german fiscal policy . 
  more than two-thirds of the respondents agree with the proposition that german current account surpluses are a threat to the eurozone economy . 
  a slightly smaller majority believe that the german government ought to increase public investment in response to the surpluses . 
  that 's how i read it too : taking the `` lightning never strikes the same tree twice '' fallacy and jokingly applying it to meteors and cities . 
  correct , but ... [ rarely has this gif been more apt ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/781/383/235.gif ), 
  the first paragraph of the article says that it is about derivatives . 
  like the credit default swaps which were central to the 2008 crisis , although i 'm sure clever people have engineered a lot of new complicated financial instruments since then whose risk profiles are basically unknown and which are not regulated . 
  so to me the article says that deutsche bank has the highest exposure to such risky assets , and if something goes wrong with them , they would quickly have huge problems . 
  some say it 's a mark of a good compromise if both sides are complaining , so ...
