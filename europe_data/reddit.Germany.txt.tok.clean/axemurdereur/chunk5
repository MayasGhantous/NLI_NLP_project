  and mind you this was an extremely peaceful event . 
  if it had only been in bild i would have brushed it off as made up but it 's in spiegel as well and it fits what unofficial channels are saying . 
  scary as fuck !, 
  honestly i do n't think `` we 'll be seen as racist '' had anything to do with the police doing what they did . 
  nye here is very chaotic with explosives going of everywhere ( and that is ok ) and tons of drunk people , people traveling etc. . 
  it would be hard to spot a group of pick-pockets even when they are a bigger group . 
  they move through the crowd , each incident probably only lasts seconds . 
  the reporting was very weak imho . 
  they reported that `` a group of 1000 males assaulted women '' which makes you think of a gang-raping horde but its just wrong . 
  there were around 1000 people on this square and within this soup of young mostly male and drunk people setting of fireworks and whatnot women were molested and robbed . 
  that only means that there was a ( likely small ) group of people doing this in a coordinated way using the crowd and groping as distraction to rob the victims . 
  it does not mean that there were 1000 gang-raping wild muslim migrants or some shit . 
  if that would have been the case the police would have stepped in . 
  in fact during the night the police reported that it was rather uneventful ( for nye ) . 
  they only learned later that these crimes took place and that there were so many incidents ( which suggests coordination and planning among the perps ) . 
  it could have been one gang , say 10 people that basically pick-pocketed in a very coordinated fashion . 
  today i learned the pretty descriptive term `` antanzen '' ( dancing/grinding ) which is police jargon for a targeted body-contact maneuver to distract the victim . 
  that tactic has been used by thieves for ages . 
   http://www.spiegel.tv/filme/silvester-berlin-neukoelln crazy and not for me but actually the guys were pretty likable . 
  when the two groups are `` attacking '' each other the guy explains that it does n't mean they have any ill-will against each other and that its just for fun and they probably all know each other . 
  just heard this news today from a friend ( was n't here until yesterday ) . 
  i read some of the reports . 
  its crazy but one thing bugs me very much . 
  everywhere it says `` witnesses described the perpetrators as north-african/arab looking '' . 
  ok i get arab looking and african as well but how the fuck would anyone describe someone as north-african looking ? 
  like whats the distinction ? 
  i would say that none of the people in my social circle would ever make such a narrow distinction . 
  can anyone explain that to me ? 
  pff darknet , bs thats way to complicated . 
  you just need to meet in person once to set up a secure communication channel . 
  well its easy to call in everyone for a singular special event . 
  like `` frankeh you have to come in this weekend , it 's really important '' . 
  but thats not sustainable . 
  that is a very different tone . 
  fucking press . 
  thank you !, 
  imho that is exactly what is missing . 
  just watched the video . 
  they are planning to seize ( seize ! ), 
  empty commercial buildings . 
  yes they say it unlikely because all state resources must be exhausted first but they are also talking about new laws to make that possible . 
  in a snippet they specifically say `` flats '' so commercial is obviously a wide term . 
  like holy fuck !, 
  and you expect me to believe that there is * net benefit * and all my fears are unfounded ? 
  some of the worst fears seem to be all too realistic . 
  greek is not responsible but look at it this way : if these people stay for a while , do you want a large uneducated population amongst you ? 
  uneducated people create problems and probably do n't benefit the society much . 
  although a proper education costs a pretty penny it will also teach some of our value and will make them them more compatible with our culture . 
  that being said , the article clearly has an agenda . 
  does your browser not render ~ ~ strikethrough ~ ~ ? 
  but here is an example : if you watched anne will on sunday it should be clear what i am talking about , maybe its still available in a mediathek or something . 
  of course your own perspective plays into the perception but i found it unbearable . 
  so much so that i turned it off after a while . 
  ah ok then it makes sense . 
  they should have mentioned it imho because it sounded like they would show all possible coalitions purely based on the numbers and thats just not the case . 
  thanks for clearing that up !, 
  why would they include the fdp then ? 
  they even mentioned that its just mathematically an option because they would n't work together . 
  also they did show options with the cdu . 
  as i understood it , the party with the most votes has to be in the coalition ? 
  same here , peoples memories are short : /, 
  i have one question ( serious ) : the state media presented mathematically possible coalitions . 
  they even showed one with the fdp !, 
  is there a prohibiting factor that would prevent the afd which has twice the votes to be part of a coalition ? 
  i googled up and down but could n't find an answer . 
  i did n't vote for the afd nor do i particularly like them * ~ ~ but i think this is a prime example of leftist state media fact skewing , they just cut them out ~ ~ edit : guess its not . 
  ^ ^ ^ * how ^ ^ ^ sad ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ add ^ ^ ^ such ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ disclaimer ? 
  sorry this has happened to you !, 
  its right prejudices run deep but i believe thats in everyone , so everyone has some prejudices about something . 
  when they leak out we are often not aware that it might be hurtful to the person we talk to . 
  for instance i used to say something like `` that gay shit '' when something really annoyed me . 
  i never held a particularly negative view of gay people . 
  so i worked in an office with a friend that is gay , he is a really cool guy . 
  of course sometimes i would just call things gay in anger but then one day it hit me that it might be offensive , so i asked him . 
  of course he knew it was n't personal or anything but indeed it did annoy him . 
  i stopped using that phrase , it was easier than i thought . 
  do n't take it personal . 
  some people are just assholes . 
  that last guy to me sound like he tried to be a tough guy and or funny , depends on the surrounding . 
  people in the workshop usually have a little rough humor . 
  they often say hurtful things on purpose , the best way is to respond equally . 
  thats what wildcard responses like `` your mom 's used to the desert '' are made for . 
  disclaimer : highly depends on the surrounding . 
  i 'll stop rambling now . 
  imho its a group vs. group thing that exists for everyone to some extend , so do n't take it too personal . 
  can the austrian government please take over ours ? 
  ca n't you just annex us ? 
  thanks austria , this idiot needs to be stopped !, 
  nine times out of ten , these tables and benches are located at a mediocre tourist trap . 
  the times i sit on one of these during a year i can count on one hand . 
  yeah , about that , ... it 's obviously not working . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  thats what i read everywhere . 
  is it really ? 
  it just does n't compute for me , maybe my non-religious brain is missing something but it just makes no sense . 
  all that effort for what ? 
  why should poland not be included ? 
  apart from that its likely that the named countries published a comment and the others did n't and whoever wrote the article unfortunately worded it like that . 
  no idea why that is not bigger news !, 
  ~ ~ its not even in german mainstream tv ~ ~ * and the only news source i found was some nigerian site : http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2015/11/germany-enters-the-war-against-isis/ they are deciding about it today but it does look like they will go for it .
