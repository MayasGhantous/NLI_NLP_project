thanks , i appreciate it !, 
  definitely agree that quality content should n't be lost through langauge barriers, 
  my goal with this submission was to give some context to the ` human rights complaints ' the un has launched against europe recently . 
  ( as quoted by / u/gneps below ) . 
  is it not legitimate and relevant to europe to show the way this organization is run , rather than just the results ( in the form of ridiculous islamophobia accusations against hungary , for example ) ? 
  ** merkel is doing europe a disservice ** * what a mistake : the germans believe in the smooth integration of the migrants . 
  they will be surprised - and put the eu in serious danger . 
  * the current mass migration is a topic of public debate across europe , but especially in germany . 
  through the use of the term `` refugee '' , rather than the more fitting term , `` economically motivated migrant '' , the debate becomes unserious and misleading , and the excessive political correctness borders on suicidal behaviour . 
  the social sciences teach us ( in this rare case , not contradicting common sense ) that internal cohesion forms the foundation of a smoothly functioning and productive society . 
  in economics , this is described as `` human and social capital '' , without which a functioning state system is impossible . 
  the current migration debate ignores these basic facts . 
  those who are blinded by the ideology of multiculturalism do not see any problems here - they believe that it 's possible to `` fill up '' the societies of europe with migrants . 
  ** migrants as a means to an end ** in this context it is not surprising that politicians refuse to face the task of stopping the migrant wave . 
  they only discuss how it can somehow be accommodated - in the form of money , welcoming them with open arms , providing housing , and especially by promising them a better life . 
  why though ? 
  i 'd like to quote my colleague jiri weigl , who believes that it is in fact the purpose of the `` welcome politics '' towards migrants is to permanently destroy the cohesion of the current societies in europe . 
  only on the ruins of the `` old societies '' can the politicians erect their `` new europe '' - obviously without those of us who are content with our current europe . 
  the migrants should become the `` first members of the desired european nation '' , according to weigl . 
  they have no attachment to any individual european country , and as a result can identify much easier with the new multicultural europe . 
  the migrants are a means to an end , forming the basis of a new europe . 
  ** fatal mistake by the germans ** there 's another reason for the behaviour of many european , and especially german politicans . 
  perhaps they believe in the naive assumption that while this mass migration may do some damage in the short-term , the long term effects will be exclusively positive . 
  this is a fatal mistake . 
  the assumption made by some politicians , such as mister gauck and mrs. merkel , that the migrants will become motivated , intelligent , educated and could replace aging germans on the labour market , is absolutely laughable . 
  it contradicts all of the experiences germany has previously had with its migrants and guest workers . 
  it is known that humans acquire their general behaviour patterns in their youth , with the family usually playing the most prominent role . 
  as such , it could also be that the advocates for mass migration believe in the power of re-education , manipulation and indoctrination . 
  they may believe in the creation of a new human shaped entirely by their ideas , in the tradition of aldous huxleys brilliant book `` brave new world '' . 
  ** the german invitation ** that is an almost childish idea . 
  wolfgang kasper , a german who 's been living in australia for half a century , says this : `` there are exceptions , but the majority of today 's migrants will have to undergo a slow process of cultural adjustment which will take multiple generations . '' kaspers also refers to the fact that the second generation of immigrants often rejects their integration into european society , often rejecting western values altogether . 
  if such tendencies become dominant , there is the threat that the `` cultural adjustment '' will occur in the opposite direction . 
  last but not least , it is important to consider why the migration wave is occuring at this moment . 
  what turn of events caused people from kosovo to come to bavaria in such large numbers that they constitute 40 percent of the migrants there ? 
  there has been no armed conflict in the region for 15 years . 
  and the other 40 percent who came to bavaria from afghanistan , where armed conflicts have been raging for decades ? 
  there has not been a dramatic change in the situation at home for the migrants . 
  they did however - sometimes implicitly , sometimes explicitly - receive the message that they can migrate to europe . 
  emboldened by the justified frustration about the conditions in their countries , they leave their home for europe , mostly germany . 
  this journey often includes exorbitant payments to smuggling gangs . 
  ** european siren calls ** the migrants are following the siren calls of the irresponsible european politicians without realizing the risks and threats they and their families and children might face - the deaths in the mediterranean are tragic evidence . 
  they all follow the promise that that they will be allowed to live in europe . 
  politicians like angela merkel and joachim gauck encourage them through their statements . 
  maybe these politicians believe , their invitation is a positive humanitarian gesture . 
  they are n't . 
  on the contrary . 
  they are a disservice for europe . 
  i am deeply concerned about the future of european civilization . 
  that 's what 's at stake here . 
  considering current events , do n't you think that it 's interesting that the same organization that [ condemns hungary for defending its borders ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3lbsm0/united_nations_high_commissioner_for_human_rights/ ) appoints a country with an atrocious human rights record to a key un human rights panel ? 
  - as some have said already , external refugee camps in turkey for syrian asylum seekers , potentially one in niger for africans - as a result , nobody should be allowed to enter europe before a successful asylum application - fixed caps on amount of asylum seekers per year , no mandatory quotas - fence around the outer border of the eu , like in hungary - increase security in mediterranean waters . 
  stop saving the ships , do not allow people to come ashore . 
  send the boats back as australia has done . 
  - instant deportation for illegal immigrants , criminals , terrorist sympathisers - restrict availability of citizenship to refugees ( europe-wide , as it affects everyone through schengen ), 
  all european states are members of the un, 
  the only thing at risk is the credibility of that pathetic organization if they continue advocating for open borders and critizing countries for defending their borders against a violent mob . . 
  but ** muh human rights ** !, 
  ** the eastern europeans are right ** is it so hard to understand ? 
  the eastern european eu member states simply do not want a migrant quota system imposed by the eu . 
  interior minister de maiziere is now considering `` finding ways to pressure '' the states opposed to quotas . 
  that is a polite euphemism for blackmail . 
  apparently , the world should embrace germany 's approach to refugees . 
  but eastern europe wo n't accept it - for good reasons . 
  in the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , poland and the baltic states , people are realizing how even a high-technology country such as germany with a huge state apparatus is no longer able to cope , and how criminality and cuts to the police are affecting germany . 
  whoever blames the eastern europeans for not wanting parallel societies developing in their major cities , as we now have in berlin or duisburg , does n't grasp the extent of the problem . 
  ** it 's about national identity and sovereignity ** \u201e the eastern europeans have no sense of shame `` , claimed * die welt * . 
  such a sweeping generalization about millions of people show the extent of the current smear campaign . 
  in fact , it 's the people that want to force their migrant policy on other countries who possess no `` sense of shame '' it is a matter of national identity . 
  while the german government has decided to take in masses of asylum seekers , budapest , prague and warsaw are taking a different approach . 
  they ask the questions : `` can we integrate these people ? 
  is it desirable to import large islamic minorities into our countries ? '' after looking at germany , the answers to those questions are found quickly : no , and no . 
  ** brussels wants a blank cheque ** while the political left was outraged about germanys alleged meddling in greek internal affairs a few months ago , they now demand the opposite : more power to brussels and less democracy . 
  the german government seems surprised by the fact that our neighbours wo n't just surrender their national interests . 
  the mandatory quota that berlin is emphatically pushing for would hand the eu a blank cheque to distribute hundreds of thousands across national borders . 
  if the german government opens the borders in another knee-jerk reaction , poland for example would suddenly receive thousands of new migrants . 
  ** eastern europe ca n't win ** and what if they do n't even want to go to poland ? 
  the example of hungary has shown , that the asylum seekers wo n't hesitate to use violence and break down police barriers to come to germany . 
  in the end , eastern europe would be condemned either way . 
  either because they do n't take in enough refugees , or because they 'll have to forcefully prevent them from coming to germany . 
  the czech republic 's left-leaning president milo\u0161 zeman summed up the feelings of his countrymen when he told the asylum seekers : \u201e nobody invited you here . ``,

  if you look at the areas in western europe with large muslim populations , it does not paint a nice picture for the future , especially considering the current migrant flood . 
  marseille , malm\u00f6 , bradford , birmingham , east london , paris suburbs ... the list goes on, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-18519395 ) makes me doubt the intentions behind these remarks, 
  not surprising from that islamic shithole of a city, 
  the one-sided leftist hatred of israel is so ridiculous . 
  what the hell are they supposed to do when islamic terrorists bomb their country ? 
  i definitely agree that it was a horrific decision by the us to support saddam against iran , and i wo n't even try to defend it , even though i think the term ` complicit ' may be exaggerated . 
  let 's also not forget that some european nations did the same : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_aid_to_combatants_in_the_iran%e2%80%93iraq_war#logistic_support_2 but to say that all of iran 's threats against israel have been in self-defense ? 
  i do n't even see how anything of the sort is suggested in the articles you linked . 
  it is reasonable for israel to go to any lengths to prevent a nation from acquiring nukes that has repeatedly announced its intent to exterminate them . 
  and iran has been funding terror groups such as hamas and hezbollah for years , who have both attacked israel somewhat recently . 
  god bless slovenia and hungary . 
  it 's hard to have a strong opinion when 15,000 pages of it have n't been released yet , and i ca n't claim to be an expert on it either . 
  right now , i 'm cautiously optimistic . 
  i 'm generally for free trade , and i think increased competition will benefit the customers and help the economy .
