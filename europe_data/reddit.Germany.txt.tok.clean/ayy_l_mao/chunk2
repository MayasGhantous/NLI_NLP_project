  what did you mean by the crackdown on internet ? 
  when i googled it , your post here was one of the first results . 
  but the fact that social-democratic governments in europe support it shows that its not the `` neo-liberal dystopia '' its described as sometimes . 
  i just feel like we are n't hearing both sides on this issue , especially here on reddit . 
  a lot of it seems like an anti-american kneejerk reaction , which is why i asked about the canadian free trade agreement , as i feel like that went by unnoticed while ttip is so controversial . 
  what do you think of the free trade agreements the eu has signed with other countries , such as canada last year ? 
  the difference is that saudi arabia is ( despite its royal terrorism ties ) allied to the us , while iran holds death to america rallies and threatens israel , an important us ally . 
  i doubt anyone really cares about domestic policy, 
  what do you mean ? 
  de maiziere does n't have a lot of autonomy . 
  and i do n't see how merkel and de maiziere differ on the migrant issue . 
  this is unbelievable . 
  she caused this flow of migrants by saying she will give up dublin procedures for certain people , and by encouraging a complete surrender of border security . 
  she literally funneled these people to germany . 
  to now spread them across europe , and even worse , threatening the respectable countries that refuse to let their country get overrun , is a disgrace . 
  she wants everyone to share the burden of her own fuck-up . 
  it worked in north africa and it works in hungary , as we can see from the new migration numbers . 
  seems like the solution is pretty clear . 
  well , considering : - nothing but a strongly worded letter was the un response when assad gassed his own people . 
  - saudi arabia is chairing the human rights council . 
  - the general anti-western and `` anti-zionist '' ( wink wink nudge nudge ) ideology that dominates un thinking - high un officials have demanded that countries ` give up their homogenity ' and embrace multiculturalism i do not think the un should be a serious consideration when we decide what is best for our country -, 
  interesting . 
  it should be taken with a grain of salt - whether it 's disastrous is debatable , but leaving the single market will undoubtedly have an effect on the uk economy , at least in the short-term ) . 
  but if the article is right , then the main credible argument from the `` yes '' side kind of falls apart . 
  i guess it depends on whether the eu will refuse free-trade agreements out of spite . 
  but seeing that most non-eu european nations have trade agreements with the eu : http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/agreements/#_europe , i just do n't see how the same should n't be applied to britain . 
  it will be interesting to see what the `` they will come here one way or the other !, 
  '' - types have to say about this . 
  either they 'll admit border security works or they will show their true agenda . 
  and for others on the right , she went from greek crisis hero to refugee crisis pariah . 
  for the sake of everyone , let 's hope hungary stands its ground . 
  that 's definitely the right thing to do at the moment . 
  and i agree , we need to find a solution together and fast . 
  seems to be like hungary are the only ones properly enforcing eu rules at the moment , but they still get shit for it from our politicians . . 
  question about the border issue : what is happening to the people who traveled through safe countries ? 
  will they be still allowed to enter ? 
  what 's your opinion , is the uk going to leave ? 
  i saw some polls recently that seemed to show a swing to the ` no ' side, 
  i think suicidal is the accurate term , when a country with one of the most generous social safety nets in the world opens its borders to the world , resulting in absolutely crazy and unsustainable migration numbers . 
  did you know that while germany received 300k asylum seekers till july 2015 , only 8k were sent back home ? 
  if we continue to have this kind of migration flow the country is in deep trouble . 
  no , angie , nobody is criticising you for ` showing a friendly face ' - people are criticising you promoting and accelerating unsustainable levels of economic migration from culturally adverse third world countries . . 
  if you 'd rather let your emotions dictate suicidal immigration policies than stand up for the sovereignity of fellow europeans , i do n't want to be in a country with you either . 
  i think hungary closing the border to serbia , and sending people back who travel through safe countries is a good start . 
  we need to change the perception that people who travel through 5 or 6 safe countries are still ` refugees ' . 
  as soon as they travel into a safe country , they are economic migrants - the german constitution is pretty clear about this with regards to the right to refugee status : http://i.imgur.com/pvmf44g.png i think we should do more to defend the border to serbia , in the mediterranean and the border to turkey ( naval and land ) . 
  australia managed to stop its migrant flow through strict border controls , and spain 's border to morocco is also secure since it 's fenced in . 
  that , and the recent development in hungary should show that the perception that `` we ca n't do anything , they will come anyway , so let 's deal with it and spread them across europe ! '', 
  is complete bs . 
  i think genuine refugees should be able to apply for asylum in the camps in turkey or jordan . 
  it should then be up to the individual eu states if , and how many refugees , they want to accept to their country . 
  if we implemented all of that europe-wide , we would never see this type of crisis occuring in the first place . 
  and we would n't be forced to sacrifice one of the big european achievements , the schengen free travel area . 
  let them starve then . 
  i realize that it 's not the first time this has happened , the boats have been going from libya to italy for years . 
  but i think it 's fair to say that merkel 's comments and `` open doors '' policy is a significant pull-factor for more people to attempt to come to europe and has definitely exacerbated the crisis . 
  it 's bad enough merkel is destroying germany with her reckless refugee policy , but forcing it on the rest of the eu is a complete disgrace . 
  these people would have never even come to europe if merkel had n't literally invited them all to come , and said that there is no limit to the amount of refugees germany will take . 
  i 'm very sad that our chancellor seemingly values muslim immigrants over the sovereignity of our eastern european friends . 
  yeah , i hope the mediterranean will be secured in a similar fashion . 
  the main thing is that the coast guard is taking the boats from the coast of libya and letting the immigrants stay in italy , which is ridiculous and encourages this behavior . 
  it 's a good start , it will hopefully decrease the migrant flow from the middle east . 
  hopefully its only the first of many measures that will strengthen the european borders and prevent illegal immigration . 
  yeah , also this swing happened within 4 weeks . 
  pretty significant change in such a short period, 
  '' [ . . ] in the beginning of september , only ** 38 percent ** of respondents said that the number of coming to germany made them fearful . 
  four weeks later every second german ** ( 51 percent ) ** voiced this opinion '' `` in early september , ** 45 percent ** believed that federal republic benefits from migration , this has dropped to one-third ( ** 35 percent ** ) . 
  in contrast , ** 44 percent ** now say that the disadvantages of immigration for germany predominate . '', 
  merkel 's approval has dropped by 9 points down to ** 54 percent ** approval within the month . 
  horst seehofer , the most prominent critic of merkel 's migration policy , has gained ** 11 percent ** approval within the month . 
  furthermore , the anti-immigration afd ( alternative f\u00fcr deutschland ) has risen to ** 6 percent ** in national election polls , up from ** 4 percent ** . 
  the previous submission was removed for editorialisation . 
  here 's a translation of a part of the article : `` a secret document of the ministry of interior on the safety concerns due to the migrant crisis is causing an uproar . 
  the austrian security authorities analyzed refugee immigration , and came to the conclusion that a continuing influx poses a threat to national security . 
  the secret document , that was also sent to the bavarian authorities , predicts a `` threat to the maintenance of public order , peace and security in connection with continued illegal entries . '', 
  what 's the public opinion in sweden like ? 
  do people support these numbers of migrants coming to your country ? 
  that 's 3 % of the swedish population a year !, 
  yeah , agreed . 
  the `` anti-globalization '' movement is pretty big in europe , especially in france and germany - ttip is naturally a prime target for them . 
  then there 's also the anti-americanism on some parts of the left , which surely plays a part in the anti-ttip hysteria . 
  i do n't remember anyone making noise about the eu-canada fta signed last year, 
  [ approximately 100,000 asylum seekers are expected to arrive in sweden in 2015 . 
  ] ( http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.522/approximately-100-000-asylum-seekers-are-expected-to-sweden-in-2015.html ) you also have to take into account the higher acceptance rate of asylum seekers in sweden ( 76 % ) compared to germany ( 41 % ) . 
  i hope sweden elects leaders that will stop this madness , it really is a beautiful country and it would be a shame to see it ruined, 
  a statement by a low-level french government official and a small minority ( 55/650 ) of british mp 's will hardly cause the negotiations to fail , imo . 
  also i think the fact that france said its keeping a cancellation of negotations ` on the table ' is more about having leverage in the negotiations rather than a real threat to the treaty . 
  it was to be expected that russias primary concern was their strategic interests in the me ( in this case , keeping their friend assad in power ) , and not defeating isis . 
  i think these people were betrayed by the state . 
  in the name of multiculturalism and political correctness , the uk ( and others in europe ) has allowed parallel societies to grow and to not conform to western values . . stories like this are the logical result . 
  there 's never been a sovereign state called ` palestine ' . 
  the region was under british control until 1948 , and was then partitioned into jewish and arab areas . 
  despite the fact that israel controlled a tiny fraction of what you call ` muslim land ' ( which it historically is n't ) , the arab states launched a war of aggression against israel after the partition . 
  then again in 1967 , and 1973 . 
  ( with the stated goal of ` exterminating israel ' ) the palestinians launched two intifadas against israel , in 1987 , and 2000 . 
  so yeah , to me it does look like israel has been defending itself against islam since it was founded , and for such a small country it has done one hell of a job . 
  hahahah i read through your comment history . . either you are the most dedicated troll i 've ever seen or just insane . 
  [ this is you ] ( https://i.warosu.org/data/jp/img/0102/08/1355437690470.jpg ), 
  i think an israeli would probably have a more authoritative view on islamism , considering israel has been defending itself against violent muslims since it was founded . 
  and dismissing his opinion based on his nationality is not cool,
