  so you probably right ... 
  we have ramstein ( not the band !, 
  ) , biggest us aire force facility outside of the us , and basf , biggest chemical company in the world . 
  so we have american drones and chemical power ( basf produced a lot lethal gas in the first world war ) .

  more context : b\u00f6hmermann said that the poem is illegal . 
  but he put it in a different context .

  the french border is only a stone 's throw from where i live . 
  the vocabularies were no problem , since i had latin i could derive many words from it . 
  it was the pronunciation and the countless of exceptions in the grammar that led me fall into despair . 
  but nevertheless i think french is a beautiful language and even though i ca n't understand a single word , i frequently listen to french music . 
  i had english , latin and french in school . 
  but i dropped the last two when i entered senior classes ( 11-13 ) . 
  as i had latin since the fifth grade i still got my latinum . 
  french was the horror i finished it with the second worst mark and was glad when i were finally able to drop it .

  willy brandt ( spd ) lost in 1961 and 1965 but eventually became chancellor after the election in 1969 . 
  helmut kohl ( cdu ) also lost an election in 1976 . 
  but he did n't became chancellor through an election . 
  he won a vote of no confidence in 1982 against helmut schmidt ( spd ) .

  just look [ how many subreddits we have ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dach/wiki/k ) . 
  some of them are relatively big and active . 
  we have for example / r/kreiswichs for our dankest memes , / r/600euro for posts of conspiracist in social media , / r/ich _ iel german me_iel , / r/fragreddit german askreddit , / r/de _ iama german iama and / r/einfach _ posten where you can talk about whatever you want . 
  in this way we get rid of tourists who ask which city they should visit or students who want to know how to find friends in germany . 
  english threads are allowed on / r/de and are mostly welcomed but most redundant questions land in / r/germany because that 's the subreddit most foreigners find first . 
  so you want a german speaking subreddit that explicitly excludes swiss and austrian redditors ? 
  / r/de is pretty germany-centric because most of the active users are german . 
  the austrians post their news mostly on / r/austria and i do n't see much swiss topics either . 
  what do you mean ? 
  there is / r/de for all german speakers and / r/germany for the expats and tourists,
