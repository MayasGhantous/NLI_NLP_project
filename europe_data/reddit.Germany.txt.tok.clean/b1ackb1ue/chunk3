  this is the best result for a spd chairman in post-war time . 
  last record was held by kurt schumacher , he was elected with 99,71 % in 1948 . 
  the former spd chairman sigmar gabriel only had 74,27 % in 2015 , second worst result for a spd chairman . 
  for comparison : angela merkel was elected as cdu chairman with 89,5 % in 2016 , her worst result since 2004 , and horst seehofer as csu chairman ( bavarian sister party of cdu ) with 87 % in 2015 , his worst result ever . 
  `` anne will '' is the biggest talk show on german tv , yesterday over 4 million viewers watched the show . 
  topic of the show was `` what is the way out of the crisis with turkey ? '' . 
  the guests were peter altmaier , federal minister for special affairs of germany and head of the chancellery , and akif \u00c7a\u011fatay k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 , minister of youth and sports of turkey . 
  after k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 jumped back and forth between german and turkish during the show - depending on which audience his statement were rather directed - altmaier amazed with a message to the dutch in their language . 
  translation : '' ( in german ) these nazi-comparisons must stop . 
  and if i may say that : many people are listening to us from the netherlands tonight , because the show can be received there . 
  ( in dutch ) i find it particularly outrageous and particularly unjust that the netherlands was compared with nazi germany . 
  the netherlands have gone through a lot under the occupation in the war . 
  i think that the netherlands has always been a proponent of parliamentarism and democracy . 
  ( thanks / u/pm _ me_ur_surrealism for corrections ! ), 
  ( in german ) now in german : i find it particularly unfortunate that the netherlands have been exposed to this comparison . 
  who knows what the netherlands have gone through in wwii and who knows how much freedom of expression and democracy is highly valued in the netherlands , knows that this comparison was certainly not appropriate . '', 
  terrorism is when it is political , religious , or ideological motivated . 
  at the moment there are no hints for any of these . 
  according to police spokesman norbert sch\u00e4tzle , there is currently no indication of a terrorist-motivated act . 
  as soon as there is a government without the cdu/csu , complete equality will be established . 
  all party are in favour of it except cdu/csu ( and afd , but who cares about this populist minor party that do n't even want to govern ), 
  cdu is the party of angela merkel . 
  the cdu forms a political alliance with the csu , which only operates in bavaria . 
  correct . 
  i wanted to underline that slovenia did n't introduce same-sex marriage that has more rights than germany . 
  we just do n't call it as something that it is n't . 
  because cdu/csu, 
   but gay couples are not allowed to adopt . 
  gay couples can `` marry '' in germany since 2001 . 
  it 's called `` registered life partnership '' and provides most but not all of the rights of marriage like adoption . 
  the election in rhineland-palatinate in march 2016 was a good example . 
  1 month before the election pollsters had the cdu at 37 % and the spd at 31 % . 
  then we had a weird situation in the tv debate between both party leaders . 
  the cdu 's leader julia kl\u00f6ckner openly opposed angela merkel refugees policy and campaigned for a `` plan b '' whereas the spd 's leader malu dreyer attacked her opponent that she is stabbing merkel in the back and she has the feeling that herself is more behind merkels policy than her own party . 
  the spd won with 36,2 % and the cdu only got 31,8 %, 
  he is using / r/de which is not geo-default like other national subreddits . 
  / r/bundesliga is geo-dafault for germans and has more than 4-times as many subscribers, 
  i guess we have talked past each other , or at least i misinterpret your post . 
  the task of a soldier is to defend the sovereignty of the state and its interests . 
  a soldier of an eu army would defend the whole of the european union . 
  if the falkland islands would be part of the eu and a eu army , a german or spanish soldier would be prepared to defend them . 
  if they are not , they would only be if its defence would be in the interest of germany or spain . 
  in the case of mali , the interests are - in the opinion of the participating states - apparently violated . 
  what 's your point ? 
  the falkland islands are not part of the european union , therefore they would n't be in the responsibility of a potential future eu army . 
  it partly is . 
  in 2022 all our nuclear plants will be shut down , the transmission lines will not be finished before 2025 . 
  so we need something to compensate the nuclear plants . 
  bavarians does n't want to see [ high-voltage transmission lines ] ( http://bilder.augsburger-allgemeine.de/img/wirtschaft/crop30282622/118721634-ctopteaser/bei-der-energiewende-und-der-geplanten-freihandelszone-zwischen-eu-und-usa-meldet-der-bauernverband-bedenken-an.jpg ) , so the necessarily needed transmission lines to transport the renewable electricity from north to south will have to be build underground . 
  this costs a lot of money and takes more time . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/epls9af.png ) - [ source ] ( https://www.energy-charts.de/energy_de.htm ) as you can see imports are shrinking and exports are rising . 
  there is no place in germany where you can store it for thousands of years . 
  germany is very densely populated . 
  we are not like the usa where there is a big desert or like sweden with a huge mountain range where nobody lives, 
  yep, 
  [ and then `` boom '' - absolute majority ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g3bcjrv.jpg ), 
  we never had a minority government on federal level , only on state level . 
  but even there they are not usual and mostly a result of quarrels in a coalition, 
  if this trend continues then spd-cdu / csu could also happen . 
  but i 'm not sure if the cdu / csu could survive such an humiliation . 
  it would be the first time that they are the junior partner in a coalition on the federal level . 
  [ poll trend over the last year ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mmmhcja.png ) . 
  but note that insa values the cdu/csu always a lot lower than [ other agencies ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm ) . 
  [ explanation by the german host @ 4:55 ] ( https://youtu.be/wch9ewbs9fw?t=296 ) ( english subtitles available ) seems like the website ca n't handle the traffic . 
  here are the videos that are already public , more will follow : [ netherlands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eld2awfn9nc ) [ germany ] ( https://youtu.be/wch9ewbs9fw?t=107 ) [ belgium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5q5wtbhgra ) [ switzerland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reuj8yvcgsm ) [ denmark ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryppmndbqjy ), 
  / u/schulzenbrothers , the uploader of the video , claims that the spd know that / r/the _ schulz is a `` benevolently satire '' . 
  he will make a statement in the next days . 
  no , the subtitles are accurate . 
  note , that this is not his official channel . 
  schulz made a speech on sunday in the headquarter of the spd in berlin . 
  the user who uploaded this video probably showed him on this day what reddit is and made then the film . 
  the user who uploaded this made a song a few days ago : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rrg3skt3po [ lyrics ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_schulz/comments/5pxrse/das_schulzzuglied_schulzenbrothers/dcuycy4/ ) :  * chancellory instrumental intro *  good luck , good luck  the schulz train is rolling  and it has got no brakes , drives full speed ahead  and it has got no brakes , drives full speed ahead  to chancellorship , to chancellorship !, 
   out of the way  the schulz train is rolling  let us build bridges and then let 's get started  let us build bridges and then let 's get started  that 's mega awesome  that 's mega awesome !, 
   good luck , good luck  god chancellor schulz  and he saves german social democracy  and he saves german social democracy  with high energy , with high energy !, 
  i would n't be so sure . 
  the greens are in a coalition with the cdu in hesse and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  in both states they poll better now than in the last election . 
  the greens could become the after-war fdp , a party that can form a coalition with both the cdu and spd . 
  because we citizens vote parties not individuals . 
  merkel was elected as chancellor candidate by delegates of her party on a political convention and martin schulz was appointed today by the party leader without even notifying the party base . 
  he will be officially elected by delegates of his party later . 
  up to this day both parties never opened the vote to the public like in the usa or in this year in france . 
  in this way the candidates fully represent their parties and are no outsiders . 
  not impossible . 
  in the 2005 election the spd reached 34,2 % even though they were at 27 % two month before the election , the cdu fell in this time period from 42-45 % to 35,2 % . 
  last year the cdu fluctuated between 31 % and 39 % ( infratest dimap ) . 
  traffic light coalition ( spd , fdp , greens ) could also happen . 
  in rhineland-palatinate they formed a government in this style even though fdp and greens hate each other , especially since the greens in rlp are way more left-wing than the greens in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  but i would guess this not really realistic on federal level yet , unless the spd get more votes than the cdu . 
  the order is from the votes of the last election in 2013 . 
  party | % -- | -- cdu/csu | 41,5 spd | 25,7 linke | 8,6 gr\u00fcne | 8,4 * fdp * | * 4,8 ** * afd * | * 4,7 ** \\* fdp and afd could n't get in the parliament because of the 5 % threshold . 
   the ebu is working on a new eurovision format moving away from the success of the song contest to the first major sport entertainment show since jeux sans fronti\u00e8res in 1999 . 
  `` eurovision super games '' would bring together eight countries to represented by four athletes each in a challenging game of physical and mental challenges . 
   the format would see the public at home in each country select two of their four participating athletes to compete in the next set of challenges , details of whether this would be via app voting or public televote has not been revealed . 
   the contest was first presented to the member broadcasters of the ebu in july . 
  furthermore according to the ebu 's vision2020 document the format will be launched in 2017 if everything goes to plan . 
  even though the number of seats is varying every year the seats are distributed proportionally . 
  that means that the cdu would get 38 % of the seats ( actually a litte bit more because 5 % of the votes in this poll are for parties that ca n't get over the threshold ),
