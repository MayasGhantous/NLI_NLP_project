she actually said `` as long as i life '' - quite an immoral offer for her opponents, 
  the thing is , that the german parliament has no right to give away the budget control - even to the democratic elected eu parliament . 
  there must be a referendum to hand over responsibility . 
  but it would actually decrease a democracy deficit , so i 'm not sure what you are talking . 
  i fully agree . 
  uncomfortable for the countries having to ask for some money and their people , but the german government and population as well . 
  if the only benefit of a deeper eu integration would be a responsible government that does its work on a day to day basis , rather than a hectic reunion of all national responsible every month , that are talking until late night just to disappoint everybody yet another time , we should definitely go for it . 
  the first name * weimar republic * is an informal name , while the second is the official name . 
  anyhow the 3rd german republic wo n't be the * european federal republic * , but a german republic , as a member state of the eu . 
  a new constitution is just an easiest way to go . 
  the current one demands full budget control by the german parliament and can not be changed by the parliament . 
  meanwhile there is a clause in the constitution ( which is actually called * basic law * and is preliminary ) that it can be replaces ( by something actually called constitution ) , when germany is reunited ( done ' 90 ) , the population votes in a free referendum , and the human rights remain untouched . 
  so far no one touched the constitution , because ... 
  i guess , never change a running system . 
  this might have changed now . 
  ok , it was misleading . 
  however , numbers are not inherently evil . 
  there were three reichs ( empires , realms ) and two republics in germany so far . 
  having a reich back , would make it a fourth . 
  the next republic would be the 3rd . 
  so i guess we have to skip that number , like some skyscrapers do n't have a 13nd floor ... 
  it 's quite racist ...  greeks can live on one euro per day . 
  africans do it . 
  asians do it . 
  south americans do it . 
  great interview . 
  he basically said , what most r/europe is saying for the last months . 
  a fiscal union is a precondition for a german `` yes '' to euro-bonds . 
    because you ca n't separate the responsibility for decisions and the liability . 
  this applies to almost all areas , but especially to money . 
  someone who has the ability to spend money at someone else 's expense will do so . 
  you do it , and so do i a fiscal union requieres a new constitution in germany , because the constitutional court wo n't allow such under the current constitution . 
  ( germans will follow the great french tradition and create a new republic once in a while . 
  the 6th republic for france and the 3rd one in germany    the europe of the future will not be a federal state based on the model of the united states of america or the federal republic of germany . 
  it will have its own structure . 
  it 's an extremely exciting venture . 
  a new european parliament has two bodies . 
  one directly elected , the other with representatives of their countries ( senat ) . 
  this brings new democratic legitimation . 
  every european country is invited to participate . 
  it might happen sooner , than some might expect . 
    at the eu summit at the end of this week , the heads of four european institutions plan to present concrete proposals for greater integration . 
  we 'll see what happens after that . 
  i think he is talking about the comments on reuters.com , not us , 
  not true in germany, 
  i 'm just guessing your sarcastic . 
  can so please post a clarifying link to the situation in the south west ? 
  exactly , furthermore the euro-zone needs the eu instituions to gain democratic legitimation . 
  will there be two parliaments ? 
  it is more likely that there will be a core eurozone parliament , that will be extended to certain circumstances to eu parliament . 
  the uk will be dragged out of the core eu institutions ( because they will be needed in a fiscal union ) , but stay a full-member on paper , with all comercial benefits . 
  you mean cesar could just cross with his soldiers and say : `` ups have n't see it '', 
  and maybe we rename the * zenne * ( river in brussels ) to * rubicon * , 
  maybe we should define * army * in a new way . 
  there is no need for millions of soldiers , but selected specialist ( seal-like forces , marine , airforce , ... ) these troops are likely not the best way to solve major deseas . 
  so why not create independently civil forces to confront natural deseases . 
  maybe some unarmed * homeland security * . 
  every country could contribute with existing structures ( thw in germany , firefighters , tracking dogs ) we do ** not ** need armed forces to solve inner-european problems . 
  why not creating a civil defence for that purpose ? 
  do such men really need a military supervisor ? 
  if they need special equipment , they just borrow it from the armed forces . 
  maybe they even borrow a specialist to operate the equipment ( e.g. 
  a jet equipped with an infra-red camera , to search a lost child in a wide area . ), 
  but everything very limited and under local , civil command . 
  i know that soldiers are patroling stations , airports !, 
  but i do n't want foreign soldiers protecting me from invisible terrorists, 
  nice try imperator , 
  about a common army : i 'm not against it , but i demand one condition . 
  this army must * never * operate insight the eu territory . 
  i just imagine a star wars like confederation vs. rebellion civil war . 
  just image the greeks ( any other country ) wo n't pay their debts . 
  will we send eu troops to stabilize the country and * support * the lawful , and democratic elected local government ? 
  no circumstance * ever * should allow an inner-european operation . 
  no terrorist attack , zombie outbreak , catastrophe ... 
  this is my personal red line in eu integration . 
  ** edit ** ok , they can operate insight the territory defending the eu against an invasion . 
  but no peace-keeping operation against inner riots or supporting police should be ever possible, 
  we need a new federal state , that is neither a copy of the us nor germany . 
  * i 'm not overall conviced , that i prefer a presidential democracy : i 'd might prefer a parliamentarian . 
  ( pro german federal state ) * i 'm not convinced , that senators should be announced by the local government , but freely elected ( pro us model ) * no bullshit , like electing for electoral votes ( against us system ), 
  but i must admit ( and this might be a reason for the several downvotes ) that the colours do not reflect a fair comparison . 
  it is ridiculous , that 0 % -54 % is a single category in a colour so bright , that it can be confused with * no data * . 
  as i understand the question people could be both british and european . 
  however i dont ' t think the uk is * that * eurosceptic , as you mentioned . 
  48 % citizens say , they feel european . 
  i think it is quite a lot . 
  considering that british often talk about * the continent * , as if they are not a part of it ... 
  [ germany disputes : is it ok to be pleased with this ?!, 
  ] ( http://www.titanic-magazin.de/uploads/pics/titanic201106komplett-1_03.jpg ) * context : assassination of osama bin laden *, 
  for a young german , this is actually funny . 
  at the time ( 2004 ) the team was looking for a good `` striker '' . 
  and the german word `` st\u00fcrmer '' is close to attack . 
  it 's just incredible incorrect and surreal , which makes it funny . 
  can other nations see the humor ? 
  btw : it is not in any context with poland . 
  not sure ... after the reunion of west and east germany 1990 franz beckenbauer said the same thing about the united german team . 
  the first generation matth\u00e4us ( west ) and sammer ( east ) was successful ( victory 90 and 96 ) , but then came a certain gap and lousy results . 
  the actual squad is successful , but exclusively west-german . 
  there is no advantage of the reunion in german football . 
  you can perfectly support different teams , drink together and have a good time .
