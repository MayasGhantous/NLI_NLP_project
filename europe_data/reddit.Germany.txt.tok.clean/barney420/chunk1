k.i.z !, 
  teenagers and kids can be brutal , i doubt it will ever change . 
  i don \u00b4 t feel think homosexuals are mocked in europe at all . 
  else he/she wouldn \u00b4 t have won . 
  i think it \u00b4 s kinda sad one can only win with being `` different '' . 
  as much as i disagree with russia atm conchita is a fkin joke ... we don \u00b4 t need ppl sending a `` political message '' like that . 
  makes me feel bad about living close to austria . 
  we just sat there with open mouths with around 10 people , we actually thought it \u00b4 s a serious contest because nobody really watched it before . 
  well i dunno the name `` eurovision song contest '' actually sounds pretty serious . 
  it was a shame to watch for me . 
  seriously every fkin country was a joke and a pain in the ears . 
  well i can \u00b4 t read polish but the title sounds pretty dumb . 
  another reason for my weird hate on brits . 
  you realize gerhardt schroeder isn \u00b4 t active anymore ? 
  he \u00b4 s just a normal person like you and me , he has no political influence at all . 
  it \u00b4 s really sad to see other countries believe we support russia . 
  dunno about other \u00b4 s but in germany netflix is not a thing . 
  eggs , obviously :d, 
  what in the hell . . 
  seriously those are really bad laws tbh , nobody can deny me alcohol at any time lol . 
  this is actually racist lol, 
  this . 
  i don \u00b4 t even care and i didn \u00b4 t even read your comment . 
  it \u00b4 s been 50 years , `` hitler '' is not a no-go word anymore . 
  butthurt . 
  ok i overreacted , no i don \u00b4 t love her . 
  cause you got ta take everything serious . 
  well i guess schr\u00f6der took atleast the time to hear his opposition . 
  why are you getting butthurt ? 
  can i not mention hitler ? 
  ok , let \u00b4 s say they are worse then stalin . 
  is that okay ? 
  no , merkel and the cdu are . 
  they are the worst shit since hitler . 
  yeah i love the point where i \u00b4 m 14 again . . but thats not the point . 
  the point is a survey doesn \u00b4 t make sence if people are misinformed, 
  i never said anyone is trying to push putin or make him look good . 
  my main point is that this survey was prolly made by spiegel , in their own magazine . 
  and if you deny the fact that they don \u00b4 t provide real facts you are simply stubborn . 
  that was never my point . 
  my point is spiegel , bild ( well no need for mentioning them actually ) and other media in germany have lied about what happens in ukraine . 
  they didn \u00b4 t push a pro-russia agenda , what they did is just giving us wrong information . 
  they don \u00b4 t want us to see what happens in ukraine , they said those were friendly protests , which is a straight lie . 
  the ukrainian ppl used force in their protest . 
  they don \u00b4 t want us to know that , cuz you know we may actually start doing smth here too . 
  yeah , spiegel must be super legit . 
  seriously open your eyes . 
  yes spiegel , which was just found out to be lieing about everything in the ukraine . 
  and yes as a german i \u00b4 m pretty much an insider about this . 
  * cough * t-online new so legit * cough * edit : do you know what \u00b4 s up with german media lately ? 
  i \u00b4 m german and i can confirm this is bullshit, 
  i mean why does germany even exist anymor ? 
  dat is definitiv ne deftige frikadelle . 
  dam it looks fkin bad ass . 
  i might be completly wrong but imo that isn \u00b4 t a amphibious assault ship . 
  i remember being in holiday like 1 year before they introduced the euro . 
  people where full of hopes , we as germans knew they would prolly get fked, 
  guess they \u00b4 d even dig a tunnel from hungary to germany , with their bare hands . 
  look in your heart hungary , your country is already shit , please let us be . 
  mutter merkel !, 
  yes . 
  why do you think i don \u00b4 t know this ? 
  what makes you think that based on my post ? 
  that \u00b4 s exactly what i am trying to say . 
  they use j&k to get closer to the youth . 
  you are ridiculous . 
  germany uses the most known youth-tv stars for propaganda . 
  they actually say everyone who says something against refugees are nazis . 
  the first time i saw the spot my jaw literally dropped . 
  nobody cares about their skin color . 
  i \u00b4 m sorry for you . 
  how is that not propaganda ? 
  kids will believe everything . 
  at this point i don \u00b4 t care at all . 
  our neighbours came from russia about 25 years ago . 
  their credit interest was 1 % . 
  ours was 5 % . 
  same bank , same street , same hard working people . 
  they should be lucky they weren \u00b4 t shot on the border like murica would do . 
  they just get more in germany . 
  so i guess you mean with military as security ? 
  prolly a better idea then to keep them all in europe . 
  people who showed resistance were killed . 
  please , go back in your shelter and fkin hang yourself . 
  are you fkin serious ? 
  what about the russian raping , stealing and killing germans who had nothing to do with the war ? 
  it \u00b4 s so ridiculous . . 
  why should they ? 
  if they can stay in europe i doubt they would ever want to go back . 
  i wonder what happens if everyone migrates . 
  what happens with africa itself ? 
  germany doesn \u00b4 t have to make up for the world wars . 
  it \u00b4 s not like there aren \u00b4 t hundredthousand of other dieinng at the same time in a different country , we can \u00b4 t help everyone but that \u00b4 s certainly what merkel plans , well i wouldn \u00b4 t care either if i earn 250k $ for the rest of my life . 
  you forget that actually getting german costs money too . 
  i don \u00b4 t get the point were we give social welfare to any but our own people . 
  ah i see , would have been ridic if they just sit there for 6 years . 
  that \u00b4 s ridiculous . 
  i won \u00b4 t pay for people living 6 fkin years for free . 
  people forget that those people cost us a shit load of money and i \u00b4 m tired of people saying we owe them . 
  we owe nobody anthing .
