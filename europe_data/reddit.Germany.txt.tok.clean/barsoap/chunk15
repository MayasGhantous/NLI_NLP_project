  that does n't make the figure for the uk wrong , though , just not ( necessarily ) accurate for its parts . 
   who now live in saxony mainly there 's no saxons in present-day state of saxony , it 's a mixture of thuringians , bavarians , etc. 
  we 're still living in the north of germany ( a good part of the netherlands is saxon , too ) , the title just drifted over the ages . 
  `` holstein '' actually means `` wood saxony '' . 
   southern jutland - the southern home of the jutes . 
  `` jutland '' is very much a geographical name , too , though . 
   and the people living in slesvig wanted to get away from germany , they wanted to be distinctly danish schleswig was never purely danish , it was [ divided according to referendum results modulo straight borders ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/abstimmung-schleswig-1920.png ) ... the referendum was n't even done in the whole of schleswig as it was clear from the outset that the very south would choose germany . 
  much of the area that voted for germany is frisian , who provably make the best red grit of the lot of us . 
  if i wanted to be bitter , i 'd say that the sjaellish devils got that area because they successfully forced the jutes to put their articles on the wrong side of their nouns , making them believe they 're northern , not western , germanic . 
  to even things out , though : the dannevirke is completely on our soil , as of course is hedeby . 
  not since you people renamed the northern part to not be schleswig , any more . 
  which actually would n't even anger me if you did n't have the gall to use the term `` southern jutland '' . 
  when the fuck did jutland start to stop at the danish border ? 
  the german one says no such thing . 
  heck it does n't even spell out the borders , or a list of states . 
  it talks about conditions for reorganising territory while in the federation , but nothing about leaving . 
  it 's actually the other way around : the states ' constitutions explicitely mention that they are part of the federation . 
  they 're also indisputedly subjects to international law , and functioning independent states under any state theory under the sun on their own right , so it stands to reason that to secede , all that 's necessary is to have a sufficient majority to change the constitution of the state in question . 
  on top of that : if a state did so , the federation would have no constitutional means to go against it . 
  if it does n't accept the seceding state as sovereign it ca n't send the military because the military ca n't be used within federal borders , if it does , it ca n't because that 'd be a war of aggression . 
  ca n't send the police , either , as police boots on the grounds is state prerogative, 
  within germany there 's regionally courts ( and authorities in general ) you can address in frisian and sorbian . 
  schleswig-holstein also considers low saxon an official language though there 's no special law for it ( just an interpretation of what `` german '' means that no other state shares ) . 
  there 's probably others . 
  our sintis do n't want those kinds of rights ( it 's * their * language , not the state 's ) , and danes do n't care ( in particular , danish is in no danger of dying out if it does n't have official status here , unlike frisian and sorbian ) . 
   while in reality they 're basically the best treated cultural minority in the whole world ( possibly bar south tyroleans ) our frisians , danes and yes even sinti would like to have a word with you . 
  outside of the championships flying the german flags is still , at the very least , borderline . 
  otoh they 're probably not out-right nazis as those would n't be seen dead flying those colours , black-red-gold being the colours of german * democracy * , after all . 
  outside of schreberg\u00e4rten , that is , though at least over here you 're much more likely to see flags of football teams . 
  the football thing is also relatively recent : it was the championship were turkey did n't suck completely and thus entered the first rounds , you saw turkish flags all over the place in germany back then . 
  when the turkish team got kicked out , our turks , without batting a single eye , switched to german flags . 
  it 's * kind * of reminiscent of the holland issue : before they won a match against us , german fans were very apprehensive , even though the dutch were as livid as they are now . 
  once they had their revenge in sports , though , it became a free for all . 
  they 're actually rotting and rusting away and most of them are grounded because of it . 
  and of course the bundeswehr is allowed to drive in berlin . 
  even with tanks , if they use rubber tracks : they 're not subject to the usual vehicle rules , even have their own licensing authority etc ( not to mention non-reflective number plates with different design and schema ) . 
  also ... * for its tonnage * , the leo actually is a very efficient vehicle . 
  it 's a nice and sturdy diesel , much unlike the abrahms . 
  russia has no real interest in any territory south of the caucasus , short of that that territory ( precisely , georgia ) not constantly running up the fortifications to the castle because that 's annoying . 
  they wo n't incorporate anything there into russia proper , the reason what ` sitcalled is friendly to russia is because georgia is scary . 
  to protect our colonies in the baleares . 
  the purpose of the bundeswehr was to stall the enemy at the border until an army arrives . 
  i 'd say georgia starting to shell russians was the tipping point : while on the one hand the us did n't back up georgia militarily ( as they had hoped ) , the whole thing was still portrayed in the west as russian aggression . 
  all the russians had been doing there militarily , before georgia started shit , was providing troops for a cis peacekeeping mandate ( that georgia agreed to , just to make that abundantly clear ) . 
  at that point it was clear that in some people 's eyes , russia was always going to be the bad guys , no matter what they did . 
  that severely impacts anyone 's capability to use soft power , and pragmatic and russian as putin is , the answer was `` well if we 're seen as the bad guys no matter what , then we can as well actually be the bad guys and profit '' . 
  heck there 's even people who considered chechen islamists rebels , not terrorists . 
  the chechen population certainly did n't !, 
  but , yes , the us being completely unwilling to turn down their hegemony definitely plays a role . 
  russians do n't want the us messing about in their backyard . 
  the eu does n't , either , btw , let 's see what comes out of all this trumpism connected with the refugee issue . 
  and so is ocb ( who , btw , contrary to german belief , have no ties to le pen ) . 
  bic started out with roller pens , then got into lighters and also produces tipp-ex as well as , of all things , surfboards . 
  iirc some spanish company holds most of the rest of the european lighter market , ca n't recall the name , though , and finding lighters in my apartment has become a much harder task ever since i gave up smoking . 
  banana republic is a generic term , more than that , it 's even germany 's * official * name : ** b ** ananen ** r ** epublik ** d ** eutschland . 
   no , they were returned to germany . 
  not * really * . 
  the bloody prussian refugees are the reason why we 're part of germany : the native population preferred secession , finally being sick and tired of being whipped by either danish or german national sentiment into various wars , and the occupying forces would 've readily allowed that . 
  we had n't been a prussian province for a long time , anyway , and it was a military conquest . 
  the prussians otoh reckoned that with germany being big and whole , it would be able to get the eastern territories back . 
  they were quite univocal in that , and there being three refugees for every four natives in the country , their side won the poll . 
  ... nowadays , btw , they 're fully assimilated , though maybe recognisable , if you know what to look for , by their family recipes . 
  oh , putin did try being nice but he was snubbed by virtually all of the west . 
  the man has no ideology at all but patriotism , so with that avenue not being available for russia 's development , internal coherence etc. 
  he turned towards more traditional means to at least get the coherence . 
  i can understand that the west liked yeltzin better ... completely incompetent as his administration was , they kept russia from asserting itself as a regional power . 
  not being that , otoh , is politically untenable in the long term : a country the size of russia falls apart without a certain nimbus of power , projecting it by merely existing . 
  had the hawks in washington and elsewhere understood that we 'd now have a yes slightly rowdy , but loyal friend in our east . 
   in 2014 , for instance , german forces made headlines when they were forced to use broomsticks instead of machine guns during a nato exercise , exposing the state of its underequipped military . 
  the command vehicle in question was equipped with every single weapon they were supposed to . 
  thing being : the crew was of the opinion that they ought to have an additional gun , so they took a broomstick and fired with it in the exercise , seeing if it 's of any use . 
  ... that works in the bundeswehr because it 's not petty insubordination but creative initiative . 
  those are the kind of shenanigans you just have to accept if you want mission command to have doctrinal status . 
  if you want to make fun about the state of german materiel , talk about e.g. 
  marine helicopters that rust when flying over salt water . 
  it makes perfect sense if you allow it to mean `` nights are colder than [ the current temperature ] outside '' . 
  it 's completely logical , and a very clear , and usually true , statement . 
  oberb\u00fcrgermeister is just a title for majors when the city is its own district , or belongs to a district but is big enough to do some district stuff on its own ( like norderstedt ) . 
  all full-time majors in sh are elected directly , and mostly tend to not be party-affiliated but career administrative civil servants . 
  unsalaried ones are n't , but those also do n't administer , their municipalities are part of an amt . 
  which is going to have an amtsdirektor which is kind of like a major in the administrative ( but not representative ) sense and elected by the majors of the attached municipalities . 
  how municipalities are organised is state law , and yes sh is kind of special in these matters . 
  not in italy and especially sicily it 's not . 
   a guid only known to the voter . 
  if the voter knows it it can be used to prove the vote , which breaks the secrecy of the vote . 
  secrecy of the vote is n't `` nobody can listen in '' , it 's `` the voter ca n't prove to the maf that they voted for the capo '' . 
  it 's also been shown to work on iranian nuclear facilities . 
  protip : if you buy siemens hardware , definitely definitely replace the software . 
  they never produced anything even remotely engineered , much less well-engineered , there . 
  their blenders are top notch , though . 
  a capable investment bank with attached household appliance factory . 
   what is even weirder is that it gets more votes than there are minority voters heresy !, 
  counting yourself to a minority is a constitutional right , no authority decides that but your own . 
  then , though , i voted for them , and that as a holstein ( works because heligoland is frisia but administratively holstein ) ... until they came out in favour of software patents . 
  i would be completely comfortable with them saying `` we do n't know what the fuck we 're talking about '' , which would 've been honest , and frankly i do n't expect them to have a position , but i can not in good conscience support a party that explicitly supports fucking me and every other programmer over . 
  wrote them , did n't get a reply . 
  maybe out of embarrassment , dunno , let 's see what their position is once they get asked officially by the fsf etc. 
  for the next election . 
  oh : and it 's es-es-we , not es-es-vau . 
  of course not , [ but do n't tell me they 're not a regional party ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/bundestag_2009_linke.svg/2000px-bundestag_2009_linke.svg.png ) .
