  what mainly happened is that the east is not impressed by bananas , any more , and thus ceased to vote en masse for the peddlers . 
  ( also , die linke did a much better job cleaning their ranks of stasi filth etc. 
  than the other east parties . 
  the block parties carried the system , too , too many people in the west forget that ) . 
  thus , in the east die linke is volkspartei , mostly fitting the same niche ( slightly further to the left ) as the spd in the west . 
  it 's particularly suited for migrating away from fptp even : you do n't have a complete system change like introducing proportional representation would , otoh you completely avoid the two-party system thing . 
  at that point , the positive sides that get quoted for fptp -- that you do n't have party lists , candidates are anchored in their constituency -- actually are worth listening to , because they apply to approval , too . 
  that is , with approval the system can be fixed to not be inherently worse than pure proportional . 
  mixed proportional ( e.g. 
  australia , germany ) is still better , of course ( but please do n't take the german implementation as a blueprint , it 's atrocious due to various factors , including inter-state politics demanding the mathematically impossible . 
  the sane choice here is for [ approval voting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/approval_voting ) . 
   under a longstanding electoral law intended to benefit regional parties aka the life line for the csu : even if they do n't get 5 % nation-wide , which can indeed become problematic if you 're only running in bavaria , they 'll probably always have three direct mandates in bavaria . 
  of course , the linke is a regional party in the east ( and saarland , the other east ) . 
  the ssw seats are n't guaranteed , they still have to get votes for their seats . 
  on the municipal level sh has no threshold at all , for the simple reason that there , we 've got a presidential system : the majors are elected directly , not by parliament , thus a fractured parliament incapable of stable coalitions is not an issue . 
  now that you mention it : back in the days where cheney lied through his teeth and fischer was not convinced , i argued that exact point with americans . 
  they said `` iraq will be a second germany ! '' ... 
  yeah , no . 
  germany had a long history of having an actual middle class and bourgeoisie capable of getting concessions out of the kaiser , with an electoral system that was , for its time , very progressive , not to mention the actually democratic years of the weimar republic . 
  hell the spd dates back to 1863 . 
  educated people left and right , germany had < 1 % analphabets in 1900 , for comparison : france and england had roughly 10 % , us 12 % and that 's only counting white folks ( blacks : 49 % ) . 
  it 's 23 % in current-day iraq . 
  you can imagine how much the americans were interested in such arguments . 
  after all , they had already made up their minds that something needed to be bombed . 
  well atat\u00fcrk actually ordered an opposition party to be formed so he * kind * of did his part . 
  at least he cared , that is , a rarity among autocrats . 
  the mistake , i think , was to not invest enough into education and development in the countryside . 
  democracy ca n't bring about the conditions it requires on its own because without those conditions already met you get a kind of clan-based oligarchy which is n't interested in deepening democracy . 
  an educated populace with sufficiently large middle class would 've been a safeguard , there ... in turkey , that class is mostly limited to the cities . 
  nah that 's the kebab part , meaning `` grilled or fried meat '' . 
  brits would call d\u00f6ner kebab `` grilly meaty turnie '' . 
   iter has been constantly delayed due to budgetary problems iter is getting delayed and delayed by its project structure which is more geared towards including as many countries , and their high-tech company , as possible than actually getting stuff done . 
  it 's just not efficient to e.g. 
  build coils in ten different countries because each of them wants to do something cool . 
  all that is a political decision . 
  well , wendelstein 7-x is purring like a baby dragon so i would n't be too pessimistic ... unless you invested heavily in tokamak stock , that is . 
  iter is still going to be necessary though because it 's supposed to test tritium breeding . 
  my bets are on demo being a stellerator , the project starting as soon as iter has delivered some usable results . 
  before gloves there were bare knuckles with virtually no knockouts -- reason being that you have to restrain your punch without gloves as not to break your own fingers . 
  fist to head is just a bad idea in general . 
  compared to mma gloves , then , boxing gloves are * way * heavier . 
  of course you can also put your own weight into a punch but that 's tactically much more difficult than having the moral equivalent of a lead weight attached to your hands . 
  and , no , a knockout is never , * ever * , better . 
  it 's not the impact of the fist that 's the problem , it 's crashing to the ground , uncontrolled , when none of your muscles can do anything to absorb the energy . 
  in any case , the injury statistics very clearly show that mma may be bloodier on screen , but definitely safer in the long run . 
  frankfurt already hosts the ecb . 
  munich would be a good idea , though , especially as that would make bavaria primary target in any nuclear conflict . 
  it 's actually borderline in germany , too , as in there 's strict consent requirements and if you actually duel each other instead of participating in a sport contest both get nailed for ( attempted ) bodily harm . 
  it * is * possible to consent to have bodily harm inflicted on you ( otherwise all hair stylists would be criminals ) , however , that still has to obey good mores . 
  a boxing or mma match qualifies , hotheads dishing it out on the streets , or hooligans consenting to a 10v10 , do n't . 
  then , allowing boxing and forbidding mma would be nuts . 
  boxing has a way worse track record ruining people 's health , mostly due to those ridiculous gloves which are designed to maximise knockouts . 
  d\u00fcsseldorf is in germany not austria you muppet . 
  thing being : during carnival season , the office of major is taken over ( symbolically ) by carnivalists . 
  it 's * always * been a time when the usual social norms got inversed . 
  [ for people not getting it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm909zgscpw ), 
  you 're free to not like the `` vogue for people who wear clothes pins jewellery '' stuff they do at all , you can rightly accuse their embedded stuff of being unbalanced ( hint : it 's supposed to -- it portrays a perspective ) , but their investigative shit is generally top notch . 
  those blasphemy laws generally do n't look like you 'd expect as they protect all religions and world-views from abuse , not something like `` saying that god does not exist is punishable '' . 
  there 's a reason e.g. 
  kreuz.net , a german paleo-conservative catholic site , was n't hosted in germany : it ran afoul of that law , trying to incite hatred against non-theists and `` wrong '' theists alike . 
  things like `` atheists ca n't be moral '' , stated in sufficiently abusing terms capable of disturbing public peace , come to mind . 
   but it 's another religious exclusivity in germany it applies to world views in general , as religions and world-views are equal before the constitution . 
  that is , you can in principle have a paleo-conservative catholic sentenced for abusing , in a manner suitable to disrupt public peace , humanism . 
  no , what the left needs to do is to * decrease * redistribution . 
  see , by virtue of private property and capital interest we have a steady movement of wealth from the non-owning to the owning classes , wages do n't even come close to fixing that . 
  in a nutshell . 
  to stop that systemic redistribution from the poor to the rich , there 's two principal approaches : abolish private property , or tax the rich ( also big inheritances and property ) , cut taxes for the poor to zero , invest in social welfare including right-out monetary transfers . 
  the result would be a vast economic upswing because poor people without money to spend ca n't spend shit on goods and services , and rich fucks do n't need a thousand times as many jeans as anyone else : they do n't consume according to their wealth . 
  for comparison , [ this is the largest village ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/henstedt-ulzburg/@53.7845147,9.9722006,6862m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b22f0c609b7081:0x18ef124e8cdb4b0c!8m2!3d53.7905005!4d9.9804997!6m1!1e1 ) , 26k inhabitants . 
  arnis has roughly 300 . 
  municipalities usually apply for and readily get the title `` stadt '' when they 're big enough . 
  historically it came with special rights but it 's only a title now . 
  you also never lose it , which explains arnis , and henstedt-ulzburg does n't want the title so that they can continue to make fun of quickborn , a city with 20k inhabitants . 
  this is vital for their banter economics as otherwise they 'd have to contest with norderstedt with 78k inhabitants : who may not have a nicer title than `` stadt '' , but are administratively much more independent from the district , and their mayor is n't called mayor but * high * mayor . 
  making fun of bad segeberg ( the district capital ) , is easy for everyone , though : 15k inhabitants . 
  otoh they have the karl may festival so we usually do n't . 
  that does n't mean he 's a seeheimer in the sch\u00f6derian sense , though : while not coming even close to being a democratic socialist , at least he 's a social democrat , which over all these years were quite rare in the top echelons of the spd . 
  the spd has more than one wing , and ruling a state is not the same as ruling the federation . 
  in fact , it 's * very * common for states and federation to be at odds with another , even if they happen to be ruled by the same party : states have state interests in mind , not federal policy . 
  well , the owner still has to pay you that amount . 
  or , better said : you can claim it , noone 's forcing you to not forego it either way . 
  basically , it 's an incentive to not go ahead and try to keep stuff for yourself . 
  [ here 's the relevant law ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p3876 ) . 
  that is , essentially , just a storage room in the police office . 
  they municipal ones might not look like it , but the ordnungsamt is technically a kind of police ... just without authority to exert direct force ( but very much with the authority to ticket the shit out of you ) . 
  the ordinary ( state ) police is just going to hand stuff over for storage to the municipal one , too . 
  they 're storing it for six months ( unless not sensible because it spoils or is too expensive to store ) , if the owner does n't claim in in that time you can have it , if you do n't claim it becomes municipal property , which generally means auction . 
  if the owner * does * claim things , they 're going to have to pay you ( yes , you ) 5 % of all value under 500 euro , 3 % for everything above ... but only if you actually hand it over to the fundb\u00fcro , or directly notify whoever lost it . 
  if you do n't do that , you also may be nailed for defalcation , that 's criminal law , then . 
  there 's no need to hand in anything with a value less than 10 euro , but afaiu the owner may still claim it for quite some time . 
  if you have no idea , going to the police would be a sensible thing . 
  or the town house , anything , they 're going to know , if not be able to deal with it directly . 
  not even hitler wanted south tyrol . 
  or , rather , it was a can of worms he did n't want to open with mussolini . 
  it 's not our fault that you people betrayed the roman empire by seceding .

   after a bit of shitstorm someone rational will point out that these countries shared common history under ottoman empire so similarities in culinary are to be expected , this answer satisfies the turks but tends to trigger greeks/bulgarians/serbians / whatevers this time . 
  that 's easy to avoid from the get-go : order turkish gyros with greek raki , and to top it all off armenian tsatsiki . 
  or was it albanian ?
