   demanding limits on free movement is n't unacceptable . 
  no need to demand those , also : no reason to exit to get them !, 
  they 're in the package . 
  you also have to implement them , though . 
  not to get into details : eu citizens * do not * have an unconditional right to stay , in particular , they have to not be a burden to the social system , unless they worked five years in the uk ( pay into the system , qualify to get something out of it ) . 
  when new member states access to the eu , older members have the option to limit * any * form of immigration for work purposes for seven years . 
  westminster , in its impenetrable wisdom , decided to not use those options and instead make it a free-for-all thing . 
  because economy , actually : they wanted access to a cheap labour force . 
  so , just maybe , your problem is that you allow etonians and other people at least resembling nobs to immigrate to westminster . 
  you know , that is easy to fix : just swear fealty to the dfb . 
  we 're actually waiting for you to do that , push come to shove there will be a surprise anschluss 2050 .

  that 's the nice thing about the two rounds : the first one is already an election , not a mere poll . 
  if mlp actually passes the first round people * are * going to take it seriously and vote in the second . 
  no but yes but no . 
  a ship entering through the locks into the canal section is making it heavier , the ship being directly above or not does n't change a thing . 
  ... and that is assuming that the locks wo n't leak any water when they let the ship in . 
  btw ... how about turning the commonwealth into an ever closer union ? 
  with all that brexit grousing i guess england deserves some poetic justice . 
  it was n't syriza who cooked the books ( they 're the ones still not taxing ship owners , though ) . 
   whereas so far all we 've seen when greece actually has a say in the matter is them saying `` later '' over and over , creating a de facto `` never . '', 
  because the slack they get is not sufficient to actually recover from their economic crisis and start paying back stuff !, 
  at the same time , nonsensical demands are made , consider e.g. 
  the troika demanding that cleaning personnel of the finance ministry is to be fired . 
  * that * surely will help things ... 
  demanding fiscal responsibility is one thing , and a thing the greeks are willing to oblige with , random dictates that hurt the country , and its fiscal situation , another . 
   kindly advise them to stay there . 
  we do . 
  we bloody do . 
  problem being : those countries have to be safe for the refugees . 
   for at least a few years nope . 
  of course , it happens , but usually it 's much quicker . 
  doing things such as burning your passport to appear stateless is also going to get you shitbinned , reasoning being that if you have an actual reason to apply for asylum / refugee status in germany you 're going to cooperate , not make things difficult . 
  because people still arrive and things take time , you ca n't just kick someone out the day they arrive . 
  you know , actually looking at the individual case , rule of law and everything . 
  afghanistan is partly safe , and people are getting sent back . 
  iran you 'd need to be politically prosecuted , eritrea is a no-brainer , that country is basically north korea . 
  there 's actually a couple of turks applying for visum right now due to the political situation : nato officers , in case you 're curious . 
  pakistan , algeria , egypt and georgia forget it . 
  and , no , germany does not accept economical refugees . 
  if you 're unlucky you 're just sent back to libya . 
  when the war is over , of course . 
  someone will have to build syria back up and btw there 's also deportations to tunisia and wherenot . 
  finland , netherlands , luxembourg . 
  some v4s , too , though there i can actually understand it because they are poor themselves ... but fiscally responsible . 
   de facto you germany is not distinguishing between refugees and migrants . 
  the same thing will happen to the current refugees that happened to the refugees from the balkan in the '90s : they 're going to be sent back . 
  alt-facts , eh ? 
   ecb-euros vs private ones ? 
  what the hell is that supposed to mean ? 
  we have a reserve banking system , that 's a basic fact . 
  actually ecb-issued are paper euros , coins ( via the national central banks ) and the accounts banks have with the ecb . 
  not the money on your bank account , those are issued by your bank . 
   ut there is a serious negative effect on life insurances , pensions and savings . 
  this means real people will really have less money to spend in the future , what means less consumption and less economic growth . 
  saved money by definition is not spurring growth . 
  * spent * money is , money needs to circulate to do its job otherwise it 's just bits and bytes . 
  the amount of interest you get nowadays is atrocious , yes , but disincentivising saving is the least of our troubles . 
  but how will you accumulate capital , then ? 
  this is communism !, 
  i did , thing is the ecb is only reacting to other people 's failures . 
  they have to work with what they 've got and sch\u00e4uble , too , is n't at all happy with their current policy , it 's just that he refuses to see that the rest of his actions are the cause for it . 
  monetary policy wise , aside from all the current troubles , the situation shows one thing very clearly : the ecb has trouble actually controlling the amount of money in circulation , which is due to the fact that nowadays most money in circulation actually is n't ecb-euros but private ones ( that is , the numbers on your bank statement , not the ecb euros partially backing them ) . 
  and as the banks currently are pretty darn conservative ( living down the terror of having civil servants breathe down their neck during the rescues ) the ecb can issue pretty much all the euros it wants for as little interest it wants , the banks are n't leveraging them . 
  without them being that conservative we also would n't need the juncker fond .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm909zgscpw { ), 
  it is in noone but bone-headed ideologists ' interest to perpetuate the situation , which is what happens right now . 
  greece actually runs a primary budget surplus by now , that is , if they did n't have to pay interest they 'd have money to spend . 
  at the same time their economy is in shambles and in urgent need of investment . 
  debt relief is n't even necessary , what 's necessary is not having to pay interest for a while so that greece can spend that surplus . 
  the alternative to that is the greek economy getting worse and worse , and finally the inevitable bankruptcy . 
  so the question becomes : do you want your money later or never ? 
  i prefer later , sch\u00e4uble with his hard-line approach seems to prefer never . 
  what the ecb is doing right now is actually only a stop-gap measure because politicians ca n't solve the issue . 
  finland ? 
  easy : as the refugee stream seems to be on the verge of switching from crossing the balkan to crossing russia , they surely will want to redistribute . 
  hungary needs a slap over the head when it comes to human rights , anyway , and poland is n't * that * far behind and their border to ukraine is going to become interesting . 
  as far as denmark is concerned ... 
  i guess the only thing left is the nuclear option : threaten to outlaw red grit eu-wide . 
  while i 'm cutting into my own flesh , here , it might be necessary . 
  left to where ? 
  other eu countries ? 
  home ? 
  in the latter case that 's all fine and well , in the former case they * should * get nothing more out of it than having sunk money in train tickets . 
  there 's definitely a case to be made for better information exchange , but such thing should be a given given any implementation of quotas . 
  unless you have family already somewhere , there should be no choice of which country you end up in . 
  ** una in diversitate **, 
   it is true , that germany is the biggest country in the eu with a lot of diplomatic pull , but it still needs to form majority coalitions with other other member countries . 
  it 's a german foreign policy axiom to never do things alone ... short of trying to see who would be on board , of course . 
  also , `` german stance '' is rather misleading . 
  the monetary policy thing is largely sch\u00e4uble , the old miser , how the whole thing is being managed is criticised quite heavily internally . 
  as to refugee quotas ... * what else * ? 
  we certainly ca n't leave the mediterranean states alone with the burden , and distributing them evenly throughout the eu seems to be a reasonable option , does n't it ? 
  erm , no . 
  maybe initially they were on board , but not after new labour / schr\u00f6derism . 
  the conservative parties tend to be more enterprise-friendly , yes , but they understand that in a completely different way than over in the us . 
  or , for that matter , the fdp . 
  the main drive behind ordoliberalism is that it worked incredibly well after wwii , it 's a tried and proven ( ideological ) compromise . 
  parties might argue about what kind of ordoliberalism is the way to go forward , but the key tenets are n't questioned .
