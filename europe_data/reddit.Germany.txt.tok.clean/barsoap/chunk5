  it , too , has various regional dialects , as enforced dachsprachen tend to have . 
  the only person in the country who speaks it habitually , and not in dialect , is probably marina weisband . 
  dutch is low franconian , thus middle german , also with lowlands influence . 
  not possible to tell due to the fact that danes speak as if they have three potatoes in their mouth , anyway . 
  ... and some germans call frisian ( and if not that , then low saxon ) a dialect of standard german . 
  meanwhile , dutch and standard german steadfastly refuse to be seen as dialects of each other . 
  how does that make sense ? 
  easy : both the netherlands and germany have their own army and navy . 
  [ map of article placement in denmark ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/denmark-gender.png ) ( also , number of articles ) . 
  if you class jutlandic as northern germanic it 'd indeed be the * only * northern language that says `` the house '' , not `` housethe '' . 
  for me , that 's pretty clear-cut . 
   these tribes were also indisputably west-germanics of the ingvaeonic branch . 
  that is : unlike the scandinavians , we put our articles on the correct side of our nouns . 
  and i still do n't get how the danes manage to call jutlandic a dialect of danish . 
  * it 's not even in the same bloody language group !, 
  * ... probably because northern jutland does n't have an army and fleet , any more , ever since the sjaellish devils invaded . 
  saturday is sonnabend in northern standard german ( because it 's s\u00fcnnavend in low saxon ) , so it should be put alongside the other `` eve of sunday '' . 
   wanting the proper application of english words does n't mean that it 's acceptable . 
  what it does mean is that you 're a prescriptivist , which means you 're fighting an uphill battle against language evolution . 
  [ not even basf 's industrial starch potato made it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amflora ) . 
  it would be a mistake to just say `` gene modified stuff is evil '' , though , the problem is the agricultural doctrine of the people creating those strains , which sometimes gets rigth-out insane . 
  clearfield rapeseed is a good example , the additional herbicide resistances ( bred in through traditional breeding ) make in nearly unkillable , which is a rather bad thing considering that rapeseed , if you do n't happen to be growing it , is a very nasty weed and brassica like to exchange their genes cross-species so native brassica would soon have those resistances , too . 
  [ this kind of thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/push%e2%80%93pull_agricultural_pest_management ) is actually modern agriculture . 
  but the big multinationals are never going to research such schemes because there 's no money to be made off it , and our farmers are in much too precarious an economic situation to even think of funding research . 
  i 'm not saying it 's * good * , i 'm saying that out of all the specific things , and in absence of a good term for the generic thing , it 's the one that 's going to be used in the generic sense : for the very reason that `` race '' is always an arbitrary category . 
  people often mean `` group-focussed enmity '' when they say `` racism '' . 
  language evolves , whether that makes sense or not , and whether you like it or not . 
  `` antisemite '' also does n't mean `` anti the palestinian people '' , even though , linguistically speaking , palestinians very clearly are a semitic people . 
  just roll with it . 
  ... and then there 's those that go on and `` counter '' such kind of usage with `` hurr durr muslim is n't a race '' . 
  as if that made the hate acceptable . 
  the problem is n't the story you tell yourself why you hate a certain group , the group-hating itself is the problem . 
  and i 'm not saying that `` it 's more racism than xenophobia '' . 
  i 'm just saying that `` racism '' is a natural catch-all term for that kind of assclownery , even if that makes things imprecise . 
   ** in this convention ** , the term [ . . ] shall mean they 're not trying to re-define anything here they 're just introducing a shorthand . 
  german sociology would use the mouthful `` gruppenbezogene menschenfeindlichkeit '' , `` group-focussed misanthropy/enmity '' . 
  and it 's not exactly stupid because race is a social construct and yes is * not * determined by skin colour , alone . 
  for one bonehead poles and irish are `` white '' , for the other they are n't . 
  they certainly are n't british , which british racists will also see as a different race than french or germans . 
  `` white people '' does n't tend to be a category in europe in the first place , simply because pretty much all are white . 
  heck , ashkenazi are white and yet the nazis defined them as a race . 
  those are breeds . 
  if you want to look at races ( i.e. 
  subspecies , race is n't even a biological term ) among canines , that 'd be wolves vs. dogs : they can interbreed and also have fertile offspring , but generally do n't . 
  a non-example would be polar bears vs. brown bears : as soon as their habitats happen to overlap , they fuck . 
  might have been a different subspecies , we ca n't really know for sure because it 's kind of hard to observe their breeding behaviour today . 
  the question is whether we 're talking about homo neanderthalensis , or homo sapiens neanderthalensis . 
  homo sapiens sapiens ( us ) , otoh , interbreed readily with any other homo sapiens sapiens . 
  the pheromone system even makes genetic distance enticing , which also is a good idea since we are one of the most genetically uniform species on earth and need the diversity . 
  lastly , as to `` social construct '' : did you know that irish were classed as `` non-white '' in the us for quite some while ? 
  how does that figure ? 
  tl ; dr : we either fucked or killed away all other human `` races '' , and are the only one left of our species . 
  race does n't exist but as a social construct in the first place , it has no biological basis . 
  as such it 's not surprising that the term is up for grabs for generalisation . 
  it 's called australia . 
  the french are actually also very avid vapers . 
  they also make most excellent aromas . 
  of course , the uk is notable simple because it 's the one european country who has actually made vapes policy when it comes to smoking cessation . 
  there 's only two situations in which germans do n't do this : 1 . 
  you 're driving a car 2 . 
  kids can see ... police count as kids , too , in this context . 
  because `` innere f\u00fchrung '' can not be translated . 
  in your mind , perhaps . 
  i know . 
  saying something does n't make it true , though . 
  so have christians . 
  so have * humans * . 
  so , in fact , have living beings . 
  see how less and less sense this makes the more general a group you use ? 
  how about : taliban should n't serve . 
  405 is cake flour , though . 
  have n't bought a package in ages . 
  then the ash content only tells you how much of the grain is still in the flour , it does n't tell you things like gluten makeup . 
  also , unlike wikipedia claims 1600 is n't whole-meal . 
  whole-meal does n't get its ash content listed . 
  baking bread does take a lot of time , at least when you do it properly , which you need to do when you want proper bread , yes . 
  however , very little of that time is actual work time . 
  also , i 'd be completely lost in about any other country but germany when it comes to flour . 
  properties of flour vary , and what 's considered a standard flour differs from country to country . 
  one of the two does n't have a history of building up paramilitaries , taking over countries and waging war ( including on the country 's own population ) . 
  which is a rather immediate issue when it comes to the police force . 
  in education the equation is different , in forestry administration ... meh . 
  [ as long as they 're not doing this kind of thing ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tdguorv.jpg ) i do n't give a fuck . 
  also , are n't those people internally reassigned to glue post stamps . 
  civil servants in european countries are very often close to unfireable , does n't mean that they ca n't get shitbinned . 
  well maybe you folks are just too coy to say it in that many words , yes . 
   however , that is down to him being a staunch federalist rather than a vehement anti-british . 
  brits think that there 's ( short of the respective nation 's equivalents of the edl ) anti-british people in europe ? 
  this really * does * sound just like yanks seeing an `` antiamerican circlejerk '' everywhere . 
  well , journals do n't * have * to edit , their primary and most important function is organising peer review to provide information on what papers those peers consider vetted . 
  everything else can be outsourced . 
  just give it to your students or colleague to read before you suffer the embarrassment of the peers coming back with critiques such as `` acquire an orthography auditor '' or `` prose is inscrutably confusing '' . 
  though i might be biased , here . 
  in cs , `` let 's set up a web page and mailing list '' is something people actually * just do * . 
  having an easy to use platform where peers can easily set up their own reviewing group would be a definitive asset . 
  of course , journal impact very much is still an issue . 
  otoh there 's ample of high-pedigree researchers invested in open access , it should be possible to launch high-impact journals with the names on the board of the journal alone . 
  another thing is conferences . 
  conferences invariably involve money , that 's not as easy . 
  the right to housing ( not to own it ) and the right to education ( secondary and tertiary iff the country has the necessary funds to do so ) are recognised by the [ icescr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_covenant_on_economic,_social_and_cultural_rights ) which the us steadfastly refuses to ratify .
