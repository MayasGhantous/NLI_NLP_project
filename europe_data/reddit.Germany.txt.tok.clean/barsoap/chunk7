  has it ever been * not * a lie ? 
  and on top of that you do n't even have the decency to say `` it 's not you , it 's me '' ... you 're doing the exact opposite . 
  fuck that attitude , and fuck those island apes who told you other island apes that the eu would start to beg and plead once britain started to pack its things . 
  that 's always been a lie , too , generated by olde imperialistic self-importance . 
  i 'll open my arms again , but first : collectively eat some bloody humble pie . 
   we voted to leave a political union that we 've always been pretty detached from . 
  does that really warrant the hate being spewed on here ? 
  then why did you join in the first place ? 
  `` ever closer union '' has been the language in the very first treaty you signed . 
  what you people may not get is that * you betrayed the rest of us * . 
  unfaithful buggers , the lot of you . 
  because there 's some people who somehow go ballistic over hijabs , too . 
  it 's not that burkas would be the * only * garment germany ever had a discussion about . 
  i made no such implication , the comment before already talked about hijabs . 
  i did no such thing in fact i did n't even start the hijab topic . 
  so it 's haram to discuss related topics now ? 
  who the fuck made you mod ? 
  [ we are indeed talking about hijabs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4znmsy/survey_germans_want_a_burqa_ban/d6xc56t ) as those , unlike niqabs , are actually worn in germany . 
  which is a thing hijabs do n't do . 
  it 's a hair cover , though even that is up to debate . 
  well , given that you do n't publicly display any symbols of forbidden organisations ( say , ss , nsdap ) you can actually do that . 
  what you again can not do is do an assembly in uniform , and that 's because we want no brown-shirt parades . 
  that , btw , extends also to demonstrations say the police union might do . 
  for some reason , paramedics and nurses get away with it , though : strictly speaking it 's a uniform , otoh they 're quite hard to confuse for paramilitaries . 
  yeah my grandma , for example . 
  she actually * does * have an immigrant background : emden . 
  deep , deep east frisia , the kind of east frisia where you ca n't tell whether you 're in germany or the netherlands . 
  the point of the russian self-sanctions , at least as far as i can see , is to push their own agriculture . 
  which on the one hand is a very good idea : russia not being able to supply its own demand properly is a bad thing . 
  on the other hand , fixing that by making food more expensive for the consumers -- at least in the short term -- is a decidedly russian approach . 
  not even bloody neo-liberals are * that * dark-hearted , you actually need to be a tsar to think like that . 
  frequency schmequency what we get from the sun is practically full-spectrum anyway . 
  the problem is * intensity * . 
  believe it or not , clouds block out a lot . 
  ever looked at the sun obscured by a cloud , and directly at the sun ? 
  that 's the difference we 're talking about here . 
  can you still produce solar electricity ? 
  for sure , you can even do that with moonlight . 
  however , it 's just not economical . 
  better throw those resources at windmills , the network , etc. 
  not only is the latitude non-optimal , the climate itself is also a factor : russia 's continental climate has overcast skies throughout the whole winter . 
  otoh the summers are brutal , too , at least for a coastal guy like me . 
  if we just blindly transpose american terminology , it should be `` native russian '' , 
  it 's more like the comanches are a nation of their own . 
  russian and russlandian . 
  while we 're at it , change the short name of `` russian federation '' to `` russland '' . 
  not that that 's ever going to happen , though . 
  ... and , yes , there 's russians who measure skulls , at least figuratively so . 
  no country is completely immune against assclownery . 
  sure . 
  because there 's a comparatively effective and well-staffed police force and the population relies on the criminal system to enforce justice . 
  you 're day-dreaming , the balkans are largely miles away from western standards , there . 
   what dark figures ? 
  do you even know that term ? 
  if no , what are you talking about criminological matters . 
  if yes , wtf are you asking that question . 
   balkan countries have a very low crime rate in the past decade , yet their prison conditions are horrid . 
  sure , if you ignore the dark figures . 
  and noone 's bloody talking about * luxury * ... there 's a negative value judgement right in there , and apparently `` luxury for prisoners '' already means food that does n't taste like cardboard for some people . 
  we 're talking about minimising recidivism which is a matter of learning , and viability of learning is influenced by psychological state . 
  first and foremost , think about the absence of various types of fears as those only distract . 
  otoh , late-roman decadence in prison surely would n't be conductive of a learning state , either , so stop using the term `` luxury '' . 
  but they 're * the * place to bear a child if you want your kid 's passport to say `` forestry office < location  '' under `` place of birth '' . 
  ... depending on state laws , that is . 
  afaik that 's at least how it works in sh , the local forestry office is responsible for local administrative acts . 
  avoid settled areas within the sachsenwald , though , those are [ exclaves of aum\u00fchle ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/21521+aum%c3%bchle/@53.521042,10.3185959,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b1f11304dcea11:0x4248963c6581570!8m2!3d53.5252333!4d10.3153293 ) . 
   no , there is no definitive circle within the term of `` justice '' that requires the criminal to be rehabilitated . 
  of course there is . 
  you talk about justice for the victim . 
  the people wanting to rehabilitate are talking about justice * for potential victims * : you 're completely overlooking all those people who never got hurt because of our lower ( than the us , by far ) recidivism rates . 
  you could also go the other direction and say `` well , let 's have more death penalty '' , but there you get a different problem : if , say , murder and robbery now have the same penalty you get a lot more robbers murdering their victim . 
  punishment when caught is the same , so why not lower the chance to get caught ? 
  she was n't passing the buck . 
  journalists repeatedly asked her what people could do personally , she side-stepped those questions by telling them what the city authorities will do . 
  the journalists were relentless , however , so she finally gave in and said , among other things , the arm-length thing . 
  but never let the truth get in the way of a nice narrative . 
  hamburg has always been a melting pot . 
   deutschland verrecke you know what that means , do n't you ? 
  it refers to [ this piece of art ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nbzrjswhhm ) , chorus being :  germany must die so that we can live which is a riff off [ this piece of nazi war propaganda ] ( https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/soldatenabschied_%28lersch%29 ) :  germany must live , even if we must die !, 
  slime 's song turns that propaganda it into its opposite . 
  it 's a statement against blind nationalism . 
  secondly ... what , pray tell , would be wrong with getting rid of the federation ? 
  having the states is ample . 
  the us has generally been pro-eu but anti various specific things . 
  one thing , for example , would be eu military integration . 
  because that taking off in seriousness would destroy nato , at that point you could * really * rename it to `` us and gang '' . 
  more generally i very much doubt the us would like to deal with a eu that has an actual common foreign policy , and the reason is hegemony :  a strong eu does not weaken the us . 
  at least not really , no . 
  but it definitely does threaten us positions nontheless . 
  and you fucking think that 's in any way a realistic scenario . 
  i mean it 's not hard for russia to `` leak '' something like that . 
  it 's the perfect spot to place disinformation . 
  that 's what we 're doing . 
  well , the train imams part , not the outlaw foreign ones thing . 
  if anything , it 'd be only foreign financing , anyway ( see freedom of religion ) , but the time is n't ripe yet : the first islamic theology students barely left university , by now , and the first ones are n't going to have it easy . 
  questions such as whether turkish-sponsored mosques will ever hire imams that do n't have training aside , those people still have to prove their chops . 
  theologically that should be not much of a problem because those university courses are * thorough * , and encompass the whole of islam not just some faction , but then there 's still the question of pastoral work ( university does n't teach that kind of stuff ) as well , last but not least , reputation as a group . 
  the majority of mosques in germany are n't buildings , they 're communities . 
  that is , the location that they 're in is some generic commercial space , or maybe they got some space where before there was a rabbit breeder 's association , but actual buildings designed to be mosques are quite rare . 
  the only thing you have to do to make liechtenstein diplomats happy is to not ignore and dismiss them outright .
