exactly . 
  long distance power supply in germany and austria , as well as the rest of europe , is primarily through overhead power lines . 
  yet i also can barely remember the last power failure . 
  clickbait-headlines on paper . 
  a general fad in the newspaper business . 
  `` m\u00fcnchner merkur '' ( the other non-tabloid newspaper in munich ) had the exact same headline . 
  that said , while both m\u00fcnchner merkur and augsburger allgemeine focus on local and regional issues , they are unexpectedly solid in their coverage of national/international issues . 
  italy has a quite fascinating number of local languages . 
  some , like [ ladin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ladin_language ) , apparently seem to fare somewhat better , but are nonetheless limited to a small geographically clustered group . 
  germany 's polizei is mostly organized on state level . 
  there is a federal police force , the bundespolizei , whose main task is border control , and a federal criminal investigation office ( bundeskriminalamt ) . 
  most police tasks ( by far ) are coverd by the landespolizei ( state police ) , though . 
  on municipal level , local public order forces are usually not called `` police '' in germany , but rather `` ordnungsamt '' , `` gewerbeaufsichtsamt '' , etc. 
  - with exceptions in hessen and nordrhein-westfalen states , where some cities have `` kommunalpolizei '' or `` stadtpolizei '' ( municipal police ) . 
  i am pretty sure that sleeper tickets within croatia can not be bought online . 
  their operator has recently introduced an [ online ticket shop on their website ] ( http://www.hzpp.hr/en ) , but it only sells seating tickets ( including * seats * on the overnight trains to split , incidentally , but not the beds/berths ) . 
  you * will * get all tickets including sleeper portions at the counters in prague main station ( or any other bigger station , for that matter ) . 
  since there is little to no yield managment pricing on sleeper trains , booking in advance has no benefit budget-wise anyway . 
  however , if you want to be sure of having your preferred seats and beds on these trains - which might be an issue especially if you are traveling on weekends - and/or spend the time in prague otherwise , try using an agency . 
  travel agencies have access to the railways ' booking systems . 
  http://bahnagentur-schoeneberg.de/ and https://www.gleisnost.de/ are two german agencies specialized on train tickets , and at least the former is definitely capable of handling transactions in english ( via email ) . 
   we have that as well . 
  it is called the schufa [ ... and more similar/smaller agencies ] ( https://selbstauskunft.net/unternehmen/auskunfteien ), 
   pretty cheap esp . 
  in comparison to nordic countries . 
  not wrong when comparing absolute price levels , but considering the higher income in nordic countries , food is also rather inexpensive there . 
  according to germany 's statistisches bundesamt ( federal german statistics department ) , [ germans on average spent 13,9 % of their income for `` food , drinks and tobacco '' in 2015 ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesellschaftstaat/einkommenkonsumlebensbedingungen/konsumausgaben/tabellen/gebietsstaende.html ) . 
  [ this map based on who-data ( which i could n't find quickly ) ] ( http://wsm.wsu.edu/researcher/wsmaug11_billions.pdf ) has german food expenditures relative to income at a lower level , at 11,4 % . 
  one can board/leave eurostar trains at intermediate stations as well . 
  only a few eurostar trains to/from london stop at calais , though - three per day , usually . 
  note that eurostar sells tickets bound to specific trains ( seats , even ) on specific days . 
  hence , you 'll need to book separate tickets for the london-to-calais and calais-to-brussels parts , respectively . 
  [ check eurostar.com for times and booking ] ( http://www.eurostar.com/ ) . 
   the quality of air was of course terrible even for a country focused on heavy industry . 
  this was , btw , one of the few topics in which ( then ) czechoslovakia was present in west german ( bavarian ) public discourse in the 1980ies . 
  north-eastern bavaria suffered from the unfortunate combination of polluting local industry ( especially two lignite/brown coal power plants ) , heavily industrialized areas to north ( gdr 's buna/leuna-areas ) and east ( cssr 's lignite/chemical industry centers around sokolov , chomutov and usti ) and month-long inversion weather ( restricting atmospheric mixing ) in winter . 
  [ article from german spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13509130.html ) magazine from 1984 . 
  the post-socialism legislation ( and , assuming this happened in the czech republic the same way it did in the former gdr , the outright closure of some industries ) did quickly change this for the better in the 1990ies . 
   i think it 's important to know why environmental regulations came about usually a combination of increased use of natural ressources , strains on people 's environments and the beginning of an awareness for `` nature '' in the broadest sense . 
  in germany , some conservation legislation did exist locally since the middle ages , usually prohibitting deforestation . 
  [ alexander von humboldt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_von_humboldt ) did raise awareness for `` natural monuments '' ( and is said to have coined the term ) in the early 19th century , and both schiller and goethe did alude to the worth of `` pristine nature '' several times in their writings , although broader recognition of a need for conservation came only towards the end of the century . 
  among the first legislation on the topic is a law to protect birds which was passed in prussia in 1888 . 
  prussia also created a regulatory body for `` natural heritage conservation '' in 1906 and appointed [ hugo conwentz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hugo_conwentz ) as state commissioner . 
  conwentz had been actively campaigning for the protection of natural habitats since the late 19th century , and is said to have been a big influence in the creation of the first general swedish environmental protection law in 1904 . 
  state bodies for environmental protection were also created elsewhere in germany around the same time , e. g. in bavaria in 1906 . 
  1919 's constitution of the german weimar republic did , for the first time in germany , state the protection of nature on constitutional level . 
  however , almost no general federal legislation based on this goal was passed during the 14 years of the republic , since proposed laws got stuck in jurisdiction questions on the relation between federal and state rights . 
  on state level , legislation got passed easier , which did for example allow prussia to define `` natural reserves '' - beginning with a part of [ neandertal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neandertal ) in 1921 . 
  one of the proposals on federal level was a broad `` reichsnaturschutzgesetz '' regulating the conservation of natural habitats , wildlife and natural landmarks . 
  among its main authors was [ benno wolf ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/benno_wolf ) , a key figure in the creation of prussian environmental legislation in the 1920ies . 
  while wolf was forced from his post in 1933 due to his jewish heritage - and eventually killed in theresienstadt ten years later - his drafts for the `` reichsnaturschutzgesetz '' were the main source for the legislation submitted under the direction of [ hans klose ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_klose ) in 1935 . 
  klose had been active in prussia 's natural conservation scene since the early 1920ies as well , and was appointed head of prussia 's `` zentrales referat f\u00fcr naturschutz '' ( central body for nature conservation ) earlier in 1935 . 
  the `` reichsnaturschutzgesetz '' was not enforced broadly ; especially not after the late 1930ies . 
  the law as such , however , was the foundation for legislation in the post-war german states and austria . 
  both the federal german republic ( west germany ) and austria did , for the most part , delegate nature conservation to the state legislation initially . 
  a new german general federal law ( `` bundesnaturschutzgesetz '' ) was passed only in 1977 ; its current version was passed in 2010 . 
  a federal ministry for the environment and nature conservation exists since 1986 . 
  `` as cheap as '' , based on price per liter . 
  that non-alcoholic offer additionally has to be a `` dem \u00fcblichen nachfrageverhalten in der jeweiligen gastst\u00e4tte [ ... ] angepasste [ s ] getr\u00e4nk '' ( `` a beverage suited to the usual demand in the restaurant/pub in question '' ) . 
   how did west/east germans view the presence of allied soldiers ? 
  east germans were faced with a much higher proporation of foreign forces , with about as much ( or even more ) soviet soldiers in east germany as allied soldiers in the ( geographically much bigger ) rest of germany combined . 
  yet the soviet forces were , at least after the immediate post-war years , in little direct contact with the local population . 
  unlike the western allied soldiers , soviet soldiers on leave off their bases were fairly uncommon . 
  another key difference between west and east was the public discourse about foreign troops : in the gdr , there was no public discussion about the topic at all , including fairly obvious aspects like maneuver damage ( and potential compensation thereof ) . 
  it was a sure sign of changing relations between the gdr and the ussr when the [ forst-zinna rail accident ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/eisenbahnunfall_von_forst_zinna ) , where a train hit a soviet tank , was * not * concealed in the usual way . 
  by contrast , discussions in the west were heated at times , both on smaller scales ( like noise grievances and complaints about the behaviour of allied soldiers on leave ) and in `` big picture '' - discussions about the need for the presence . 
  an especially disputed topic was the presence of certain weapon types , e. g. nuclear-capable [ pershing ii missiles ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1983/10/23/more-than-a-million-protest-missiles-in-western-europe/9d703245-36fa-40ce-8714-e281f796a472/?utm_term=.0af8738484ea ) . 
  also , quoting from [ a study by the hamburg institute for social reasearch ] ( http://www.his-online.de/en/research/211/ ) :  the image of the hegemonic powers and their armed forces was quite ambivalent . 
  among the older generation of germans who had been adults during world war ii , a feeling of cultural superiority towards `` materialistic '' americans or `` uncivilized '' russians was widespread . 
  nonetheless , each hegemonic power was portrayed as a role model for the respective german society . 
  in the east , the discourse of sovietization was imposed from above ; in west german society , the impact of `` self-americanization '' was at least as significant as educational and cultural policies implemented by the government . 
  in the 1940s and 1950s , `` amerika '' became a model linked to ideas like affluence , democracy , and technological progress , especially for youths and young adults . 
  the soviet model was by far less attractive , a fact that had its effect on perceptions of foreign troops . 
  gis , as ambassadors of the `` american way of life '' and representatives of an acknowledged , democratically legitimated political system , enjoyed considerable social appeal among west german youths , at least until the late 1960s . 
  the same can hardly be said for soviet soldiers , who lived under spartan conditions in the east . 
  the east german political system headed by the socialist unity party of germany ( sed ) and installed by the soviet union remained , in the eyes of a large part of the population , a heteronomous regime and , consequently , the soviet troops were perceived as `` occupiers '' rather than friends and allies . 
  older adults in the west harbored the same sentiments towards u.s. soldiers , who were regularly accused of exhibiting an `` occupier mentality '' [ besatzermentalit\u00e4t ] in newspaper articles or complaint letters written when incidents occurred . 
  & nbsp ; & nbsp ; btw , there still are allied soldiers in germany : the soviets ( and , from 1991 onwards , russians ) did move their forces from eastern germany until 1994 , the belgians moved until 2004 , the dutch by 2006 ( both retain some personell on german bases ) and the french left until 2014 ( with the exception of the [ franco-german-brigade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-german_brigade ) ) . 
  there still are a couple of thousand british soldiers in several locations , but their premanent deployment in germany should end by 2020 . 
  us forces ( and , to a much smaller degree , canadians ) make up the majority of foreign miltary forces in germany . 
  there are about 35 ' 000 americans in germany according to the us administration 's `` defense manpower data center '' , which is a lot less than during the `` high times '' of the cold war . 
  a lot of us-bases have been closed , and a couple will be until 2020 , but there is certainly no plan for complete detachment . 
  current views on the presence seem to be mostly something like `` out of view , out of mind '' . 
  czech ? 
  there sure are worse things to read twice . 
   i was always under the impression that the majority of kindergartens are operated by the church [ current data on kindergarten-operators in germany ] ( http://www.laendermonitor.de/fileadmin/contents/indikatoren/datenblaetter_2016/tab80_lm16.jpg ) ( upper table has numbers of children ; lower table percentages ; data from 2015 extrapolated for 2016 ) shows that about 38,7 % of kindergarten-children attend kindergartens of the two churches , i. e. protestant/ekd and the catholic church . 
  as shown , numbers do vary quite a lot between regions . 
  on local level , operators tend to cooperate rather close anyway . 
  & nbsp ;  that this also applied to things like charities too . 
  well , how to define that , especially in a context of `` church vs state '' ? 
  there is no exact definition of a charity in germany , and no ranking as such . 
  if one goes by the amount of received donations ( as far as known ) , there are a couple of church organizations in the `` top ten '' , but they are not exactly the majority . 
  [ here is a detailled list from 2007 ] ( http://fundraisingverband.de/assets/verband/zahlen%20und%20fakten/wer%20sind%20die%20organisationen%20in%20deutschland%20mit%20dem%20h%c3%b6chsten%20spendenaufkommen.pdf ) ; some newer ones which only focus on the first ten or so are around as well ( with no fundamental changes since ) . 
  & nbsp ;  i like to use the `` church tax '' thing as a way to separate out the right vs left dichotomy that grips western politics ;  is that why the cdu is so moderate ? 
  cdu is moderate because they ( with csu in bavaria ) and spd pretty much divided the middle ground of politics between them , i. e. they are moderate because the constituency mainly is . 
  german church tax pre-dates cdu by far . 
  it was created in today 's fashion in most individual german states ( e. g. , prussia , bavaria , etc ) in the 19th century or in the first years of the 20th century , and `` inherited '' by the weimar republic , nazi germany and today 's federal republic of germany . 
  ( the gdr/ddr initially also collected church tax for the churches , but stopped the practice in 1956 . ), 
  & nbsp ;  a lot of americans have never heard of a `` church tax '' . 
  sure , but that may be an issue of wording .
