  want me to post the numbers from our immigration office ? 
  nvm here there are https://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/pressemitteilungen/de/2016/01/asylantraege-dezember-2015.html, 
  2015 was 1,1 mil, 
  how many millions exactly ? 
  no one has ever thought about that solution !, 
  who knew it could be so easy . 
  afaik this law does n't only involve a specific group or a specific amount of migrants . 
  so you are right this would be `` a lot of migrants '' . 
  basically they confirmed dublin , ** migrants and refugees have to apply for asylum in the first country they enter ** . 
  in one of many cases croatia put migrants in a bus and drove them to austria to apply for asylum in austria . 
  austria wanted to send them back to croatia , people did n't want to go back so they went to court . 
  court now says austria is right . 
  however : it is lawful to help another country on humanitarian grounds . 
  so if a country says `` look i 'll take 100.000 of your migrants '' that is ok ( that was also what todays verdict was about btw , merkel 's reaction to the refugee crisis in hungary in 2015 ) . 
  our whole economic model since ww2 rests on ordoliberalism . 
  damn honey , you always post quality content . 
  i too remember the time were luther singlehandedly beat up everyone during the 30 years war . 
  terrible stuff !, 
  because ss and \u00df are not always pronounced the same , also it looks great ( and totally not like a b , how dare you !, 
  hush you it totally has a purpose . 
  ( it can depend on your keyboard layout though , i 've also seen alt + shift + s around ) there 's no shortcut for mac yet . 
  but i built myself a shortcut that turns !, 
  ! s into \u1e9e subscribe for more almighty hauptstadt wombat facts . 
  without it * in massen ( en masse ) * and * in ma\u00dfen ( in moderation ) * would look the same . 
  ca n't have that . 
  crazy swiss . 
  wonderful . 
  it was about time !, 
  glorious capital esszett !, 
  it 's for capitalised titles and names . 
  now you can finally write stra\u1e9ee , properly . 
  nah it 's ok , same suffering as with the umlaut , but manageable . 
  people like to play genocide olympics . 
  i see you have not been searching ... 
  and [ berolina ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/berlin_alexanderplatz_berolina.jpg/250px-berlin_alexanderplatz_berolina.jpg ), 
  those guys were members of the nsdap . 
  they just kept working as teachers , clerks , even in the government . 
  are you telling me because there was no nsdap after ww2 there were no nazis around ? 
  god , you are dense . 
  damn , i ca n't believe that . 
  there is so much still water to be bought everywhere . 
  evian , volvic , you name it . 
  just like in other countries . 
  all local brands also have still water . 
  right . 
  [ just vanished into thin air now did they ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurt_auschwitz_trials ), 
  yes , neonazis are known for their [ fashionable and grim uniforms ] ( http://www.handelsblatt.com/images/a-german-neo-nazi-shouts-out-on-berlins-kurfuerstendamm-during-a-neo-nazi-march/6865804/2-format2010.jpg ) . 
  1min this is the most confusing one of your comments . 
  you have many nationalities looking at your changing flair choices , 
  love how he takes a different flag every time he posts . 
  they can have all of saxony though . 
  i wo n't mind that . 
  you get more for the same price . 
  it 's a good deal poland , you should take it . 
  what a pretty round dog . 
  lovely .

  well if you put it like that . 
  i was about to start with the whole movement in the 90s and the court cases and the law that had been around for years but was n't voted on etc etc. 
  but who has time for that . 
  will probably make it to youtube in the coming days . 
  i 'll save your comment so i can post the link when i find it . 
  edit : it 's already up . 
  posted the link above . 
  it 's a long story . 
  had to admit i teared up a little sitting on my couch watching as the results were displayed . 
  i am so glad this final step was finally made . 
  reporter is my hero . 
  guess gon na watch it this weekend to depress myself . 
  we may disagree on the lesser evil ( i am not a spd voter though ) but damn that 's depressing , not surprising at all though . 
  yeah i remember the murder in duisburg . 
  was huge back then . 
  sadly a lot of people here rather like their money and as long as they pay taxes and do n't go on killing sprees the topic will not be discussed in the bundestag . 
  definitely not by the cdu/csu and i have my doubts about the spd . 
  hmmmmmmm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8srodqvqe the cdu/csu are n't better than the spd . 
  the csu is worse when it comes to corruption in bavaria especially ... 
  i remember various scandals . 
  and i do n't say that to justify the schr\u00f6der gazprom debacle . 
  i just think they are at least equally bad when it comes to fighting corruption, 
  `` most '' was for `` most comments '' are depressing . 
  which they are to me . 
  not `` most comments are victim blaming '' . 
  better said : `` damn , most of the comments int his thread are depressing . 
  you can find victim blaming and whataboutism '' . 
  damn , most of the comments in this thread are depressing . 
  victim blaming and whataboutism . 
  the majority of germans agree . 
  oh , yes definitely . 
  but that 's not that hard is it . 
  what can the eu expect from the german federal election ? 
  boredom, 
  it 's not the same . 
  just imagine a single homosexuell man trying to adopt a child . 
  it 's almost impossible . 
  so if it 's not necessary why is it still there if it would be a small thing to correct ? 
  it could have been corrected 47 times already , that 's the amount of instances the cdu/csu postponed voting on the right of lesbian and gays . 
  47 times . 
  i wo n't even comment on that `` high priority '' nonsense . 
  the law will be changed ?
