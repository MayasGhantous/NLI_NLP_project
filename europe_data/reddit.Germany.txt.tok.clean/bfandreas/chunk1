that 's about the only game i prefered to play in german . 
  and i actually liked the locations and the realistic depiction of the munich werewolf boh\u00e8me . 
  that 's the one that turns people into werewolves . 
  i learned that from gabriel knight !, 
  public transport can be fun to ride if you do it conciously . 
  i can absolutely understand , why your wife and you did that . 
  it is a very good way to explore without the hassle . 
  my tram connects 4 cities , crosses two major rivers , goes past vineyards , industrial estates , at least two major chateaus , through the center of 3 old cities with the architecture to boot , passes valleys and hills and major shifts in landscape . 
  ... and i mostly use it on my daily commute ( which only passes one chateau ) . 
  the end of each line would place me into various shades of holiday destinations . 
  it 's not a story the frankfurters would tell you . 
  it 's a mannheim legend . 
  the salonwagen was an ornate tram of mannheim , so powerful and so wise it could use beer to influence the libido to create life ... it had such a knowledge of the booze , it could even keep the ones it cared about from sobering up . 
  edit : yep , that 's the one . 
  sounds expensive to rent , tho . 
  can confirm . 
  am continental and cosmopolitan and eurocrat . 
  i will get drunk as per eu regulation later this evening . 
  what 's even worse is that we stopped paying attention . 
  in my mind all those past incidents somehow fused together . 
  they are that common . 
  edit : wow , domodedowo was in 2011 . 
  has it already been that long ? 
  do n't worry . 
  they wo n't use it to run you over . 
  they will be busy chasing me . 
  basel is a great city . 
  it is up there when it comes to art and architecture . 
  it has all the appeal zurich lacks . 
  right ? 
  at times i feel you lot keep gibraltar around so the newspapers can have their little outrage every once in a while . 
  sometimes it makes front-page . 
  it definitely makes the front-page of the sun if it has nice tits . 
  this one is an outrage of samantha fox proportions . 
  it might even start a singing career . 
  could n't you just put it on really high tracks like the s-bahn in berlin or any other place on the world ? 
  it would be as high ... 
  how about `` feuerrettungsgasse '' ? 
  awww , come on . 
  stuff like that happens every week or so . 
  sometimes it gets noticed , sometimes it does n't . 
  last time i was paying attention was when they squabbled about some sea barriers or something . 
   oh my god fuck trams i would n't know about that . 
  but a couple of years ago there was a pic on the internet of a guy who did that with his car . 
  in every other case i would have assumed they wanted to drive a stake through his heart . 
  but given we are talking pis , it probably was a steak . 
  it 's in fact part of the road laws in germany . 
  if you hear emergency responders on the autobahn you have to do what most of the people did there . 
  it 's called a ` feuergasse ' . 
  ... and do n't even think of abusing that one . 
  i believe they have increased the penalty for that to twenty lashings on the exposed glans/clit . 
  unwritten rules of germany rule # 4711 : do n't be ` that guy ' . 
  i just noticed it would also go to the [ palatinate ] ( https://youtu.be/nfylcvu4j1w?t=1h17m26s ) . 
  in fact you could ride it from heidelberg to bad d\u00fcrkheim . 
  or simply get a bottle of wine and some food and ride the regular tram from heidelberg to bad d\u00fcrkheim . 
  you would only have to change trains once . 
  that 's 3 hours of the most beautiful bits of germany for 7 $ . 
  edit : yes , frenchies , the green stuff to the left and the right of the tracks is wine . 
  and it is good . 
  it 's only for hire . 
  so mostly for companies . 
  or weddings/anniversaries . 
  to answer your question : not at all . 
  the total cost would go into the thousands . 
  ... and i would very much love to ride it myself . 
  the whole heidelberg/weinheim/mannheim / heidelberg [ route ] ( https://www.rnv-online.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/plaene/liniennetzplaene/liniennetzplan_eventfahrzeuge.pdf ) which would be over [ two hours of this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/0pv6wh9iyde ), 
  the one in monnem is classier and nicer . 
  edit : but i think it is not open to the public . 
  you can watch it drive through the heidelberg/mannheim/weinheim area once every blue moon .

  well , i have the agnostics benefit here and find the question what is or is n't permitted by some religion a bit irrelevant . 
  to be honest , last time i read the bible ( and the quran two years later ) was 30 years ago . 
  what impressed me with both were they were both undoubtedly hugely influential on humanism ( do n't ask , i had a weird upbringing ) . 
  personally i find both books as relevant to modern society as the lord of the rings . 
  it took me years to feel comfortable with patriotism , but the grundgesetz is a good foundation and it 's something i like . 
  this is my country . 
  there are many like it but this is mine . 
  i feel for the surviving twin . 
  it 's hard to accept that shit happens . 
  the potato brothers weren ' my favorite people but i really understand him . 
  it 's a misuse of official non-power , though . 
  well , the tracks also get slippery with pollen in the spring . 
  is n't that just tree cum ? 
  deutsche bahn : we fail in all seasons . 
  i do n't think the eu has changed the way how it that much over the last 3 months . 
  why this sudden change of hearts ? 
  did somebody give him a blue pacifier with yellow stars on it ? 
  here we go again ... iirc they tried to land in fog when they should n't have . 
  was n't that ages ago ? 
  that 's actually a very clever solution to freight . 
  [ heidelberg/mannheim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pv6wh9iyde ) [ this is the old one you can rent for mobile keggers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt68bqjvxde ), 
  the motto of deutsche bahn : winter is coming !, 
  summer is coming !, 
  you get various weather-related failures and are either freezing cold or scalding hot but always miserable . 
  were the kids old enough to be asked where they wanted to live ? 
  when my parents separated i wanted to stay with my mum . 
  then again , my dad was constantly in the us and i only got to see him twice a year . 
  divorce is always hard . 
  which is why i do n't have kids .
