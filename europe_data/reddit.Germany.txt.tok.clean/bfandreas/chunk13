  have you ever seen an old australian ? 
  they are always young people with backpacks , asking you if they can sleep on your couch . 
   italian ... introverts ... 
  mind = blown !, 
  how do you survive in those harsh and noisy lands ? 
  last time i ate spanish food they brought me cold soup . 
  i told the spanish waiter to heat it up and bring it to me . 
  he returned with tears in his face since i asserted dominance !, 
  i do n't get the deal . 
  what 's it with gazpacho ? 
  do you get older waiting for it to heat up ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ totally ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ stolen ^ ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ ^ red ^ ^ ^ ^ dwarf . 
   cachopos is that heart-attack on a plate ? 
  making pizza at home is hard . 
  you need ultra-hot ovens for that . 
  those limp german ones only go to 220 \u00b0 c. 
  nah , it 's that nice italian veg wot dun it . 
  does n't seem to look like the world is buying . 
  mexico declined to buy that wall . 
  politely . 
  the us has already refunded that muslim ban . 
  twice . 
  said , it 's not what they ordered . 
  allergies , you know . 
  absolutely . 
  seems to be already happening on a bilateral level . 
  smart spending instead of heavy spending . 
  https://warontherocks.com/2017/03/germanys-new-defense-pragmatism-is-not-measured-in-euros/ seems like is germany needs to spend more , it could put golden ts on their tanks and give trump royalties for it . 
  alright . 
  this is becoming confusing . 
  has anybody been keeping tabs ? 
  who is owing money to whom atm ? 
  i know that britain owes money to germany for crimes against sausagekind . 
  and france owes belgium for all that beer . 
  sweden still owes denmark for this rather unfortunate lutefisk incident . 
  italy owes everybody else an explanation . 
  yep , for increased military spending even making sense , you need to build structures first . 
  otherwise it 's just throwing money at a fan , hoping to turn it into an ac . 
  what ? 
  you mean turning the us into a presidential republic ? 
  he would n't know how to pull that off successfully . 
  with supreme coincidence , vox has just covered those possible scenarios . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrtjxnsuybc td ; dw : president needs to be successfully tried for his own personal criminal misconduct . 
  too many people need to agree to remove him . 
  it takes forever . 
  term over . 
  you need to troll him for that ? 
  i read a german op-ed which said that the best way to get his heckles up would to unfollow and unfriend him . 
  imagine he wakes up one morning and has 0 twitter followers ... 
  none of the houses wants to seriously impeach the potus whoever they may be . 
  it 's better to have him half impeached and have a sitting lame duck than going through the whole shit-show again without ample preparation . 
  it 's even less likely since both houses are a bit in bed with trump and also royally fucked . 
  just the other day i read a headline about potus issuing a stupid statement and i was baffled . 
  then i remembered it was trump . 
  i had a fever due to martian flu from hell . 
  but i will never really get to the point where the words potus and trump in close proximity do n't give me the creeps . 
  which is fitting given who the potus is . 
  i think the only way to keep him around in an inert fashion would be to get rid of this brain parasite infesting his head . 
  wilders , johnson and karashit had those too , you know ? 
  berlin is like a black hole , slurping in all of those delicious surrounding bundesl\u00e4nder . 
  edit : wtf ? 
  ireland ? 
  use condoms !, 
  this is one example : http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/news/politik/nrw/fast-37-prozent-der-f%c3%b6rdermittel-nicht-abgerufen-article1587952.html http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/koalition-will-alleinerziehende-staerker-entlasten-a-1028983.html the interesting bit here is that there is significant leftover from the betreuungsgeld . 
  http://fraktion.cdu-bw.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/artikel/pm-1082016-nicht-abgerufenen-bundesmittel-fuer-den-strassenbau.html http://www.n-tv.de/politik/kommunen-rufen-kaum-bundesmittel-ab-article18599706.html the most often cited reasons are administrative shortages and planning problems . 
  the above link mentions administrators tied up with refugees . 
  the only problem is , this has been an ongoing thing for a couple of years before that . 
  i 'm not sure if a complete picture on this has yet been reported on . 
  fuck me if i understand enough of that . 
  i am not a socio-economist . 
  just a computer scientist with a phd in paying fucking attention to things repeatedly being reported on . 
  edit : sorry for that little outburst . 
  i 'm to old for meme-based politics . 
  that 's quite possible . 
  we shall see . 
  germany is not the us . 
  our party spectrum is n't one-dimensional . 
  there 's a lot more to it than left or right . 
  you need to look at specific positions and choose accordingly . 
  this left/right classification has n't been useful for over 100 years . 
  we might as well choose two colors and start shouting nika !, 
  nika !, 
  it would be a riot . 
   he doesn \u00b4 t ** flip-flop ** positions every two weeks . 
  thats a big difference politically . 
  do n't use that word . 
  it became one of those killer phrases during the bush/kerry campaign , nobody thinks about it any further and frankly , makes you look a bit like a berk . 
  if you want to say that somebody changed positions in a troublesome manner , then state the said position and say why you find that changing an opinion is in your opinion a problem . 
  if you have an opinion , then argue it . 
  if you ca n't then sit down and think about it . 
  until then , an opinion is one of two things everybody has . 
  if you can come up with ways to combat this and get people to read the actual fucking manifestos instead of regurgitating tweet-sized vomit then i do owe you a beer . 
  well , you can start with julius streicher . 
  there are an awful lot of parallels . 
  including fake rape stories and plastering memes all over the place . 
  memes are n't only lazy image macros . 
  they are ideas that spread like a virus . 
  sometimes they die out and it takes you a couple of minutes to recognize them again . 
  here 's one : https://youtu.be/rbnmt9iuwi0?t=24m28s this one is a meme you might not be familiar with : https://youtu.be/cftuidsr_t8?t=1m12s that one never was a thing in germany . 
  we watched that as a kind and thought , yummm , roast chicken and watermelon would be nice right now .
