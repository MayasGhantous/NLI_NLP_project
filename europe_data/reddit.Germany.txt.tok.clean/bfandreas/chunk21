  dunno how wilders fan-base would react to that . 
  all i know about him is that he hates muslims and has fantastic hair . 
  like that other guy . 
  random american who has never been to europe feels compelled to comment on europe . 
  cute . 
  that 's new . 
  they have the highest wine consumption per capita in germany and the worst wine . 
  that 's a shit combination , i feel . 
  must be all that inbreeding in those valleys . 
   the tradition has been kept for decades ah !, 
  just because something is tradition and has always been done that way does n't necessarily mean that it is a good thing . 
  tradition is a non-argument . 
  militia keeping guns at home and this not causing a massive problem and that being a huge part of the swiss defense concept otoh is . 
  calling something tradition translates to me that the original purpose has been lost and it has n't been examined for ages whether the practice still fulfills the purpose . 
  my consulting fees are quite high for that reason :p, 
  yep . 
  it 's always best not to follow news like that just when the first headline appears . 
  it can always be boiled down to : * people injured . 
  we do n't know anything yet . 
  stay tuned !, 
  * ummm , no . 
  how about , let 's forget about the whole thing until there is something to know , let the police do their thing and pay attention when there is actual news . 
  i once bought a beer at the reithalle and drank it behind the bundeshaus . 
  looked plenty shady to me . 
  do n't tell me , basel can be worse . 
  the militia keeping guns at home has been an ongoing debate in switzerland for the last couple of decades . 
  every now and then there 's an incident . 
  mostly domestic . 
  mostly suicide . 
  problem is , this is news emphasis . 
  which does n't do anything to describe how big of a problem it is and if something has to be/can be done about it . 
  basing policies on news reports alone is populism . 
  basing policies on ideology alone is extremism . 
  basing it on statistics alone is realpolitik . 
  best way to do it is probably a mixture of all three . 
  coming from a country with practically invisible guns i sure got a shock when i was on a train from bienne to olten on a friday evening . 
  you guys really should warn stupid germans about that , tho . 
  `` progressive '' is a us thing . 
  i would n't be able to define it in an euro context since in the us it stands for `` healthcare '' , `` affordable education '' and `` abortion '' . 
  so us `` progressive '' is mostly europe 1990ies . 
  hang on !, 
  those are genuinely irish ? 
  i always thought they were some jackasses from d\u00fcsseldorf showing off ... 
  saaaay , are those ice-cubes you are hiding behind your back ? 
  yep . 
  and we all know , where the best wine comes from . 
  jezza is at times an odd one . 
  otoh he really , really likes to wave the union jack and comes over as a bit of a berk . 
  but otoh he says and does heartwarming stuff . 
  one could raise the suspicion that he may actually be human . 
  but please do n't quote me on that . 
  usually i would feel compelled to pull a double-jeopardy ( american-italian as in dual citizenship and not american who thinks they are italian ) bit of banter on you but in the general spirit of goodwill i shall join the group-hug . 
  have a nice one , 
  i do n't get it ? 
  what 's the purpose of this ? 
  is it some kind of 3d effect ? 
  what am i supposed to see there ? 
  why else does one montage exactly the same picture next to each other ? 
  you may be right . 
  he actually does n't resemble a walrus that much . 
  maybe more of a seal ? 
  the way it is hard to tell were his neck begins and his head starts . 
  some people actually have a chin for that . 
   i 'll hope for interesting , rather than awkward  i find most of the time both may be applicable at the same time :d, 
  are we really arguing over who 's junk-food is worse ? 
  less retarded is the new progressive . 
  i 'm afraid the bar got lowered in 2016 by quite a bit . 
  we may also need air drops again . 
  police just seized 30kg of weed and 30g of testosterone . 
  yep , we 're also confused by that combination . 
  is n't he dead ? 
  that would explain his silence ... 
  i am so going to hell for that . 
  nononono , that 's what you have opium wars for . 
  bish-bash-bosh , international drug trade open again . 
  huzzah for the royal maritime drug trade !, 
  ** edit : wait , did they bring cash and buy shit ? 
  or did they bring guns and british travel arrangements . 
  i feel there 's a distinction to make . 
  oh , and make sure they do n't smuggle in mel gibson . 
  again . 
  edit2 : do n't you just hate it when hollywood actors try to fake an aussie accent ? 
  that 88 puts you on a list . 
  or it makes posting on / r/europe a bit awkward . 
  or interesting . 
  whatever pickles your pork . 
  take your pick . 
  ooops . 
  wrong guy . 
  the number 88 is n't very popular in europe . 
  it 's a sign of bad luck . 
  like the number 4 in china , the 88 stands for death . 
  you might want to try to fake your age while you are on / r/europe to avoid further confusion . 
  we need to resurrect atat\u00fcrk who may or may not have views on the akp . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ akp ^ ^ ^ ^ would ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ him ^ ^ ^ ^ react ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ some ^ ^ ^ ^ anzacs ^ ^ ^ ^ vacationing ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ gallipoli . 
  well , do they even have time to vote between the care for the akp-mandated 3 children , her husband and the prophet ? 
  mr walrusgan is becoming more ridiculous by the minute . 
  remember , how that jackass reacted to soma ? 
  ... which have been systematically eroded over the past 10 years . 
  darth erdogan manages to control major media outlets and imprisons whoever he ca n't control .
