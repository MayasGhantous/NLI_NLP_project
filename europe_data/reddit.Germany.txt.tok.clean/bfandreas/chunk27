  nazi war criminals and that guy seem to live forever . 
  i will stay away from that sub forever . 
  i 've got my fill from talking to refugees in my city . 
  a lot of those tales involve turkish border police . 
  and mostly assad due to where the majority comes from . 
  i get so mad every time the orange utan opens his mouth and all he has to say is isis . 
  well , the spelling offended me something savage !, 
  nope . 
  in basel it is a crap-shot who you get connected to . 
  and on the way there you may even get connected to french providers . 
  it is oh so confusing . 
  bonn was n't german at that time . 
  black forest cherry cake . 
  i feel like i need to shoot a yank . 
  i know a shop in munich which sells only those . 
  do n't ask me . 
  it is confusing . 
  one possible explanation would be : munich . 
  but he was a right pissant !, 
  he was a problemb\u00e4r . 
  he was so problematic we even invented a new word for him . 
  jaywalking is not a laughing matter !, 
  mine eyes !, 
  the goggles do nothing !, 
  honestly . 
  i cringed hard . 
  that has already been worked out and the answer was a hard ** nein ** , ** non * , ** nope ** . 
  but they 'd be invited to apply . 
  the latest news was that brexit has to pass parliament , first . 
  scotland already voted against . 
  these next few weeks are going to be interesting . 
  bacause the schulz-train ca n't be stopped . 
  honestly , that poor man must be completely confused . 
  who ever opened that sub was either a genius , a moron or both . 
  hang on !, 
  you still got those cats wot got no tails !, 
  it 's all fun and games until you have to fill body-bags . 
  the tantrums and weasels were fun . 
  the results were not . 
  syria already has russia/iran in it ( on the side of assad ) . 
  turkey on the side of `` moderate '' islamists but definitely against kurds and not very keen on assad ( they may drop bombs on isis for pr purposes , too ) . 
  saudi arabian money surely is floating around isis coffers . 
  at this point i would n't even know whom to bomb . 
  the worst seems to be assad . 
  isis is on its last leg ( wonder how many more legs they 've got , we 've been told they were goners for over a year now ) . 
  so i guess , let 's bomb isis . 
  it 's the best pr and we 'd not step on russia 's / iran 's toes . 
  and with the syria problem not solved we could pat our backs and call ourselves good boys . 
  do n't ask me . 
  i got nothing . 
  oh i am so very sorry . 
  that is ... confusing . 
  eta thought about it for a bit longer and it became even more confusing . 
  is it a clever ploy to sell the sun to scousers ? 
  while being ~ ~ australian ~ ~ yank ? 
  or is it some kind of joke my over-engineered german brain ca n't grasp ? 
  you are taking the piss , are n't you ? 
  they renamed french fries into freedom fries to piss you off . 
  belgium is still confused about it . 
  i was in the uk in '04 and it was all over the bloody news . 
  in germany ... not so much . 
  there the yanks had bogarted that whole ** our nation is heroically at war while you do nothing ( o noes ) ** freedom-fried nonesense . 
  if the were covered coffins , they had the right colours , but the wrong pattern on it . 
  if it were n't for top gear and jezza promoting his help for heroes engagement , i 'd guess germany would have been even less aware in general . 
  more than one is needed to make a couple of kn\u00f6del . 
  not too many of those in the palatinate . 
  potatoes already come in the proper shape . 
  make the karashit hairdo great again !, 
  he did n't do statistics . 
  he did analysis and visualization and interpretation of statistics . 
  he used this to spread optimism and that , my friend , is in dreadfully short supply as of late . 
  he was such an optimist and had the stats to back it up . 
  he really opened my eyes to how much better we are off than we ever had been before . 
  ca n't say i miss that asshole . 
  what 's it with all terrorists either being white-supremacy weirdos or petty criminals who found allah ? 
  i once tried being in mainz . 
  barely made it out of there before it permanently put me to sleep  i 'm a little bit further south and we 've got just about everything in the 3 cities i can easily reach . 
  bavaria is a wasteland covered with agriculture and munich . 
  bavaria is actually a very diverse place . 
  you 've got lower and upper bavaria , frankonia and suabia . 
  all these are not alike . 
  no two cities in bavaria are alike . 
  augsburg for instance is an interesting baroque/renaissance/roman mix . 
  w\u00fcrzburg is underrated . 
  bavaria is in fact amazing . 
  munich can be safely skipped . 
  ... and weissw\u00fcrste do n't infest all of it . 
  he seems to be a bit bolder than they were 20 years ago . 
  he 'd pick a side . 
  especially in serbia . 
   sadly only one country in the world can turn in a decent profit by exporting freedom and democracy . 
  and it ai n't us !, 
   sweden ? 
  i was n't aware they were selling . 
  that 's a pity . 
  if you ever have the tremendous luck of spending time in the palatinate you will get really good food and wine . 
  the landscape is not unlike tuscany and the average temperature is always higher than in the rest of germany . 
  sausages are proper sausages . 
  meat is proper meat . 
  wine is proper wine .
