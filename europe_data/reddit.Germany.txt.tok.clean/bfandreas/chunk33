  is there anything we can help you with ? 
  you sound unreasonably upset . 
  then do n't state an opinion on the internet in the first place . 
  i do n't get that argument . 
  either they are biased or they are factual . 
  there is no such thing as a biased fact . 
  there are biased opinions . 
  but those are opinion pieces and easily avoided . 
  looks legit at first glance . 
  headlines match teasers which match the text . 
  no distortion detectable ... 
  when did they spring up . 
  never heard of them before ? 
  that still does n't make their reporting incorrect . 
  as in : not factual . 
  unless you are referring to op-eds . 
  yes . 
  and no . 
  the g\u00fclen movement is a religious one . 
  mr erdolf had allied with them until a few years ago . 
  g\u00fclen and the rhino had allied up and g\u00fclen got institutions closer to erdonoballs by converting and intruducing his own members . 
  which was especially important with the turkish army since those were the greatest threat to anybody trying to seize power . 
  erdogan had used the gulenist movement in the past as his 5th column . 
  that does n't mean that everybody he accuses of being a gulenist is one or even if they were have done anything wrong . 
  that 's true !, 
  we arrange the peeled bananas next to two balls of vanilla ice cream , get scared of the result and obscure the obscenity with chocolate sauce . 
  they also had those wicked sharp slices of mango . 
  i bet the us army is n't trained in how to react when attacked with a banana . 
  i 'm sure the german one is n't . 
  we 'd be doomed if they tried . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ ^ laying ^ ^ ^ ^ off ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ blackadder ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ monty ^ ^ ^ ^ python ^ ^ ^ ^ references . 
  there 's an easy check for that : is it owned by murdoch ? 
  but we also have a flag !, 
  this is not how this is supposed to work !, 
  wow !, 
  they 'd be home before christmas , then . 
  with time for shopping to spare . 
  what ? 
  again ? 
  it 's a forward defensive stroke . 
  i believe that was a popular military tactic of the british empire . 
  especially if the assailants ( who were a couple of oceans over and had yet to hear of britain ) were armed with terribly dangerous fruit-based weaponry . 
  i believe erdogan feels this also applies here . 
  should n't you be starting the fire in the grill ? 
  is everything ok ? 
  do you need sausage donations ? 
  we do n't want a repeat of the great cervelat drought of 2006 . 
  you will now have to grillier the ceremonial cervelat . 
  also , the swiss do it right . 
  they have their national holiday on a sensible date . 
  not early october like certain morons . 
  i do n't want to have a bbq in october !, 
  what where they thinking ? 
  alain de botton is a little bit late on it . 
  but he points things out the remain campaign should have . 
  or should have done better . 
  i must have had a stroke mid-sentence . 
  the edelstoff is the one with the golden label . 
  the other one i was thinking of was the one with the green label . 
  i know that beck 's is pils . 
  but i feel the augustiner is equally inoffensive . 
  well , the green label one . 
  the best beer you will get is always the one you can have . 
  and right now i wish i could have the one they sell at the hirschgarten . 
  i ca n't , so i will drink the zlatopramen i currently have in my fridge . 
  you can get that imported if you ask for it at enough gert\u00e4nkem\u00e4rkte . 
  you wo n't get it at a supermarket . 
  there is something else wrong with it . 
  when it comes to mild , inoffensive beers i feel that the augustiner export is on top . 
  yet beck 's also falls into that category . 
  i know , i know , they are n't comparable in any other respect . 
  but i wonder why the one feels good and the other does n't . 
  is there a beer sommelier in the house ? 
  we may need one !, 
  otherwise this could mean civil war in germany !, 
  wow , people still remember that ? 
  i find the assumption a bit unfair . 
  lack of oxygen and extreme conditions are n't conducive to rational actions . 
  i doubt even himself even know , what exactly happened to his brother . 
   pa ' gente de lujo try czech beer when you get a chance . 
  zlatopramen for instance is a non-posh surprisingly good and honest beer . 
  erdofred is only a * halbes h\u00e4ndl * . 
  he only has 50 % support back in turkey . 
  so `` completely untenable '' may be too strong a phrase . 
  for the time being there is little sense to continue the talks . 
  must have been the heat or global warming . 
  ** i 'm not going to mop that up !, 
  really ? 
  i like the idea that they did a slap-dash job of getting rid of it . 
  and then shoddily put a burger king into it . 
  subversive in its irreverence . 
  alright . 
  you owe me dry cleaning for my shirt and a new monitor . 
  i 'll take care of the rest of the spillage myself . 
  they are all members of one huge death metal band . 
  their mascot is a corpse nailed to a tree . 
  seems plausible for finland . 
  granted all of those . 
  but the thing with physics and the nature sciences in general is that they try to build simplifying models so they can make predictions according to these models and compare that to the real world . 
  if you applied the newtonean model while building a house on planet earth , you could be reasonable sure it will not fall over .
