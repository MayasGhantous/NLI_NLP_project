  probably wrong . 
  reality is a lot more complex . 
  poles are ... ** beep ** generalizations . 
  probably wrong . 
  reality is probably a lot more complex . 
  simply saying that spitting on teenagers is not what poland should look like does n't need a deeper analysis of either poland , teenagers or muslims . 
  here , deeper rational thought is not needed . 
  your gut feeling is intact . 
  be patriotic and point out the obvious . 
  whether this incident happened or not is not even relevant . 
  spitting on kids is not ok . not even hypothetical . 
  i feel that if you phrase it like that you do n't have to argue a lot with your patriotic compatriots and can feel patriotic yourself . 
  edit : do n't argue philosophy with a german or you will be overwhelmed with a wall of text . 
  ** beep ** generalization . 
  probably wrong . 
  i 'd say because it at times feels good to be part of something . 
  patriotism also includes pointing out things which are not good or could be improved . 
  there will be nay-sayers who will go the easier route and either say the bad thing is good or that it did n't happen . 
  you can also leave the country if you feel that it is a lost cause . 
  but i do n't think poland is anywhere near that . 
  it 's got a bad phase . 
  but that too shall pass . 
  the incident is bad . 
  watch , if there is a discussion about it . 
  if there is n't one , you 're boned and need to get out . 
  but since the discussion has already been started , you 're going to be fine . 
  i 've started watching foreigner 's vlogs on youtube just for that reason . 
  that 's where you need an outsider 's view . 
  the vloggers are astonished that the majority of their views come from germany . 
  navel-gazing also seems to be part of the german psyche . 
  here 's my explanation for the red light obedience bit . 
  we respect rules which make sense mostly unconditionally . 
  and ignore others and smoke weed like anybody else . 
  but that 's not my point . 
  we respect useful rules even if nobody is watching . 
  and we expect others to do so as well . 
  while we at times do not do so , we still trespass with a guilty conscience . 
  part of being german is striving for integrity . 
  has it ever crossed your mind to jump over those barriers at public toilets to avoid paying your 50 cents ? 
  mind . 
  blown . 
  paying those 50 cents makes sense because that 's what pays for the staff and the upkeep . 
  so it is a useful rule and so we follow it . 
  even if nobody is looking . 
  integration in germany is easy . 
  learn the language . 
  follow the useful rules even if nobody is looking . 
  german . 
  awww . 
  come on . 
  people who ate pizza have done horrible things . 
  so why would i even want to eat pizza . 
  do n't be a dick . 
  problem solved . 
   sadly for many patriotism means superiority . 
  because chauvinism used to mean exactly that . 
  i 've been living outside of germany a lot . 
  and it took me this kind of travel to discover , how german i actually am . 
  and i embraced those bits and i am proud of those that make sense . 
  i do n't know if you tried something similar ( probably ) . 
  but coming home really feels like coming home . 
  enjoying the things that are done right at home . 
  i think , that 's what patriotism is about . 
  and waving a lot of flags if there is a football match on , of course . 
  ... which of course means that i will avoid crossing the street at a red light . 
  unless there are severe efficiency reasons to do so . 
  in germany , patriotism was a no-no for decades . 
  then along comes a football championship in 2006 and the young folks showed how patriotism could work . 
  do n't worry about that . 
  poland only is in trouble if this does n't cause some discussion . 
  there will be people who will say this never happened . 
  there will be people who rightfully point out that not all poles are like that . 
  there will be people who will point out that this is a tendency that gains traction and is aided by the unfortunately named ruling party . 
  as long as that discussion keeps going , you all will be alright . 
  stuff like that also happens in germany . 
  but not as systematically and police would try to be helpful . 
  so yeah , this incident is cause for concern but not cause to declare poland lost . 
  be patriotic . 
  care . 
  you 've got nothing to be ashamed of and a lot to be proud of . 
  from a german point of view : polish intellectuals were a major party at the hambacher fest and we share a lot of history and culture which we can be proud of . 
  and of course a lot of history we should n't repeat . 
  but the good stuff is truly fantastic . 
  i 'm proud of that . 
  and so can you . 
  just do n't be too nationalistic and declare yourself better by default . 
  that 's a bit idiotic . 
  well , the cops will look for the spitter and not laugh in your face . 
  i feel that makes a major difference . 
  it 's ok to be a patriot . 
  it 's not ok to give oneself airs of superiority by default . 
  that guy was caught by the coppers . 
  the coppers refused to help the kids . 
  to be fair , most police forces would n't have been able to do a whole lot about it for practical reasons , but these did n't want to do their job, 
  to be fair , hamburg also has pretty violent people on the other side as well . 
  violence comes in circles . 
  whenever i am at demonstrations i will immediately leg it the first moment some asshat covers their face . 
  there is no reason for that . 
  relatively speaking , yes . 
  was there last year .
