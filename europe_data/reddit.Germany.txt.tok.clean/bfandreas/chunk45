  within 10 years luzern was transformed . 
  it always had tourism . 
  but the chinese tourism is absolutely disruptive . 
  and it pains me to say that most stereotypes of chinese abroad are accurate . 
  if you know loz\u00e4rn a bit and know the chinese ant trails you can avoid them . 
  for instance ? 
  they manage to get unruly and aggressive drunks into the drunk tank without bashing their teeth in and rarely have to fire shot . 
  german police has been training deescalation for quite some time . 
  vocational training takes 3 years . 
  and they are vetted . 
  and basic psychology is part of their training . 
  and sun glasses ( the hallmark of every bad cop ) are verboten unless necessary . 
  it took me decades to understand the * police academy * series . 
  i always wondered what they were training for ? 
  within a couple of weeks of training you 'd not even be allowed to issue parking tickets . 
  well a couple of weeks prior they were marauding through a city . 
  then they came to my neck of the woods and wanted to march through just one street over from where i live . 
  the cops looked mostly bored . 
  and they probably were a little bit pissed off that they got pulled in on a sunday . 
  but i for one was eternally grateful they barricaded those idiots off . 
  never saw one of the '' ** ho ** oligans ** ge ** gen ** sa ** lafisten '' . 
  they are exactly what 's printed on the package : nazi football hooligans hunting brown people . 
  well , there 's erdogan . 
  so he will probably attract kurds . 
  that 's going to be fun . 
  then there is the imf . 
  those will attract a left-wing crowd . 
  which is funny since the imf is currently moving away from this idiotic austerity \u00fcber alles ideology . 
  then there is donald trump . 
  for some reasons , us presidents get assassinated a lot . 
  then there probably is theresa may . 
  who simply is just plain punchable . 
  and then there is the largest group of them all : hamburg inhabitants who would rather simply have their city to themselves without all those world leaders gallivanting through the city and making a nuisance . 
  why do n't they simply have a field of cloth of gold somewhere in the sticks ? 
  i do n't understand why they always do this in population centers . 
  it 's not as if they invited the general public to the buffet . 
  edit : i have to go to hamburg for a business trip earlier next week and i 'm not looking forward to the hassle . 
  also , hamburg is its own type of ugly . 
  not a fan . 
  there will be violent groups there . 
  no doubt . 
  but lately i 'd much more worry about the right wing . 
  i still remember the hogesa riots and when it comes to lone gunmen , those tend to be right-wing . 
  there will probably also be protesters due to ethnic tensions and the inabilty to protest back home . 
  imf will undoubtedly also pull a possibly violent left-wing crowd . 
  you need to step away from the notion that the majority of violence is left-wing . 
  sell watches to both the chinese and the germans . 
  it 's luzerne all over again . 
   british and german though , they worked together in spite of the colonial competition toward a goal : make booze in china . 
  always on the same side when it really , really matters . 
  they issued a statement that will beat up everybody indiscriminately if there 's trouble . 
  german riot police is intimidating . 
  all they need is horns on their helmets and start banging their batons on their shields . 
  i 've once seen a riot police shield wall from afar . 
  if they do n't want you to get through , you ai n't gon na . 
  400 cops contained 50 or so hogesa nazis . 
  turkey has n't yet applied for that permit . 
  the imf ( of all people ) already has . 
   those security guards are all each hand picked . 
  of course they need to be . 
  not many bodyguards are skilled at protecting against dick-trampling horses . 
  i really hope he will be protected by german police riding horses with huge hooves . 
  he that comment was a reference to his supporters in germany . 
  his little erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz got 300k votes from turks living in germany . 
  to be fair , they were absolutely surprised by the situation . 
  the brazenness of those goons probably had not been a situation they were prepared for . 
  europe has had dealings with erdolfs little sa for quite some time . 
  the netherlands even marches out turkish ministers at gun-point . 
  erdolfs is a bully . 
  his sa are bullies . 
  yet if people stand up to them the cry nazi . 
  honestly , the balls this guy had until that horse trampled them off . 
  [ slow-mo for your enjoyment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbahxjupphw ), 
  it 's becoming unbearable !, 
  my man-cave has heated up from 25 \u00b0 to 26 \u00b0 . 
  i 'm just about to start my ceiling-fan ... 
  moutier was in the bern canton ? 
  that is absolutely new to me . 
  hang on , bienne as well ? 
  those are worlds apart !, 
  switzerland is that odd little country that simply works and nobody knows why . 
  in 1850 or so they had an encore to an old civil war and managed to sort that out by head-count instead of , you know , killing each other . 
  as a country , they absolutely have their shit together and are worth of emulation in some aspects . 
  of course !, 
  i 've never seen a female one . 
  or a male one . 
  or a pot of gold now that i think of it . 
  but i have seen rainbows . 
  so leprechaun confirmed . 
  so homophobe leprechauns will have to resort to rainbow swastikas if they want to avoid this ? 
  could be pricey , if they have to bury a pot of gold under each end . 
  they might want to ask for subsidies . 
  pity you did so . 
  that was part of the punchline . 
  you really should open it again . 
  patrick stewart looked so ... natural in this role . 
  just saying . 
  please do n't see this as a suggestion or anything . 
  i do n't want to leave the impression i were keen on meddling in the political affairs of a sovereign nation .
