  your voice has less weight when in a mass of 380 million.but on a local level , the numbers are a lot lower . 
  the most unamerica thing i can think of is sitting there in quiet desperation hoping somebody else somewhere fixes things . 
  back in the 90ies i watched a jim jarmusch movie . 
  in it some guy in brooklyn got fed up with plastic bags being carried into the trees by the wind . 
  so he built a contraption to get them down.he sure did n't change the world , but he made his neighborhood better and that 's something . 
  do something like that and you will feel better about yourself . 
  and if enough people do that , that 's what makes the world better . 
  pittsburg alone will not stop climate change . 
  california wo n't either . 
  but in their small ways they can help reduce the problem . 
  american desperation is a sad sight the world is n't quite ready to experience just yet . 
  forget the orange utan . 
  he does n't matter . 
  ... and those are not his policies . 
  they are 100 % gop . 
  from healthcare to climate change to lgbt issues to cannabis regulation . 
  the gop had this guy housebroken in no time while leaving him and us the illusion of control . 
  he is the fool they needed , not the fool we deserved . 
  the us is still ok . 
  they are doing their usual stuff : subverting stupidity with style . 
  have you seen the us reaction to the latest climate shenanigans ? 
  you guys are doing allright and this too shall pass . 
  optimism , inventiveness and snark are the primary us virtues . 
  i will start worrying when you lot lose that . 
  from what i can tell , that ai n't happening anytime soon . 
  shit !, 
  has my moustache again fallen into my glass , splashing wine all over my sexy french maid costume ? 
  i was in perfect disguise !, 
  now i am a damp boche in a dubious outfit . 
  i fully expect to be geoblocked . 
  it 's time to break out my sexy frenchman costume again , parbleu !, 
  loooz\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4rn is just about the same speed . 
  true that . 
  then mix it with regional or tribal dialects . 
  who knows ? 
  maybe one day / r/de will have defined the german language . 
  or we will all have to slow down mentally because we are all speaking b\u00e4rnd\u00fc\u00fctsch . 
  i really ca n't recall the context of when i last heard the phrase . 
  could have been the uk . 
  top gear maybe ? 
  phrases creep across languages all the time . 
  the german phrase is not `` das macht sinn '' . 
  it is `` das ergibt sinn '' . 
  the former is a sneaky anglicism and by now it is part of the language . 
  i would like to use this occasion to make a donation to you in purely neighborly spirit : \u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df\u00df use it wisely !, 
  austerity is not a valid answer to everything . 
  you guys will be fine . 
  ... and totally disregard , if those goods and services were actually produced in the usa . 
  i mean , how does one boycott goods from a country ? 
  even facebook is basically irish when viewed from europe . 
  and trump wants to boycott cars built in the us by a us subsidiary of a german country . 
  that shit ai n't gon na do nothing . 
  nope . 
  just not easily buying into bs . 
   lol at the ghost xd . 
  i forgot how weird some idioms sound when translated literally . 
  i 've already heard anglophones use that phrase . 
  so either it 's just uncommon or they also have hohe energie . 
  nusskati ? 
  never heard of her ? 
  is she schwarzbraun ? 
  because that 's how my m\u00e4del should be , since i 'm also schwarzbraun ? 
  actually - annoying useless preaching schooling incoming - actually it has been shown that nutella contains more nut than nusspli . 
  so the nuttier choice is nutella . 
  but you are of course free to stick to nusspli , filthy heathen pervert . 
  the guy with the holes in his hands and feet also died for you . 
  contemplate your life choices . 
  go with the cirklejerk . 
  ok , do i need to pretend * to get my gun ? 
  you did put butter an nutmeg into that ? 
  * am german , got no gun, 
  are you sure ? 
  you have to follow the instructions to a tee . 
  the cheaper ones suggest you use some milk . 
  that 's a suggestion like a gun pointed at your temple is an implication . 
  and you will have to use nutmeg . 
  and there will be butter . 
  well , back then they were unknown . 
  people jumped at aldi-pc . 
  not medion-pc . 
  it was a combination of price and brand . 
  the brand in that case having been `` aldi '' . 
  going off on a tangent . 
  i 've lived through the time when pcs stopped being a luxury and became a commodity . 
  you bought some high-end rig and 6 months later it was surpassed by something at the same price point . 
  my last pc lasted 8 years and i only replaced the video card once due to it giving up the ghost . 
  there 's a stall at my local farmer 's market . 
  they sell fresh , hand-made pasta . 
  those are great . 
  they do n't keep as well as the store-bought ones , tho . 
  but if i make something elaborate that calls for pasta , i buy fresh . 
  my grandmother used to make noodles herself . 
  paying twice as much for barilla than for no-name ? 
  fuck that !, 
  same goes for coffee . 
  i know that if i buy coffee in a supermarket , i will get mostly roasted twigs and shells and proper coffee will cost thrice as much as the most expensive brand in the whole shop . 
  so if i go cheap then i will go proper cheap . 
  same goes for tea of which i know a little bit . 
  no matter what the supermarket brand is , if i open a tea bag i fully expect twigs and rocks . 
  that wo n't be .
