   or countries of lazy and incompetent people who their own economic mistakes and not guarding the borders want to pass on to others . 
  i 'm not even sure if that was ironic . 
  that 's what killed the german pirate party . 
  they were n't able to find a common platform . 
  they simply were a bunch of dissenters , not unified in their dissent . 
  which is a pity . 
  they had a chance to fill the social-liberal gap in the german political spectrum that has been open since the 1980ies . 
  you are really , really subscribed to that fear mongering without offering solutions . 
  i think that is this deer-in-the-headlights attitude that prevents the eu from even agreeing on the necessity of combined efforts . 
  even such a simple thing as proportional distribution was impossible . 
  you are forgetting that the majority of displaced people tend to be locally displaced . 
  you simply assume that the projected growth of population ( and i 'm careful with those since i do n't know , how these projections work ) will move to europe . 
  also i do smell a whiff of malthus in your argumentation . 
  nobody disputes that a lot of people want to move to europe . 
  we could argue about the magnitude of the problem for ages . 
  which is fucking useless if people do n't offer solutions or even at least agreeing on the necessity of sustainable , long-term solutions . 
  and that 's the main problem i have with people who follow your argumentation . 
  all gloom , not willing to do anything . 
  well , anything that is more complex than building a wall . 
  which is a solution that did n't work for byzantium , china , hadrian , offa , ussr and all the other wall-builders . 
  you want to slow down perceived population growth ? 
  vote for a party that puts education in 3rd world countries as an eu effort on their agenda . 
  and kick the wall-builders to the curb . 
  well , it 's all nice and hunky-dory , when you distance yourself from it one week after the fact . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ktoje6wqa and he did n't do anything about it since he was `` ostracized by the leave campaign '' . 
  well , i wo n't dig out this interview but he was specifically asked about that fucking bus . 
  he said , that was n't his claim . 
  when asked , why he did n't speak up before the referendum , he did n't say that he did but squirmed instead . 
  yay !, 
  we 're barbarians !, 
  first , i will have to get my synthetic fur from the dry-cleaners . 
  then i 'm due for a pedicure at that fabulous place over at the next tribe . 
  then we will plan our next vacation in northern italy and then ... ... oh shit , outsiders listening in ... 
  drink their blood from their skulls !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ vegan ^ ^ ^ ^ option ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ethical ^ ^ ^ ^ reasons ? 
  not until you lot give the eagle of the 9th legion back !, 
  you fuckers certainly deep-fried and ate that !, 
  admit it !, 
   ... uncalled for . 
  you are correct . 
  on behalf of / r/europe i want to formally apologize to the mexicans . 
  i would do so in french but unfortunately i suck at that . 
  they do live in bubbles , do n't they ? 
  generally it is a good idea to spend some time in a foreign country . 
  but if you stay in a bubble you will learn nothing and waste your time . 
  invite them on a cup of coffee :d ^ ^ ^ ^ which ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ dick ^ ^ ^ ^ move ^ ^ ^ ^ since ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ ^ drink ^ ^ ^ ^ that . 
  what 's their platform in cz ? 
  in germany they ran on a liberal-left platform but unfortunately imploded due to not being able to get their shit together . 
  yeah . 
  but in 2015 there was a choice between letting millions perish or open the borders . 
  that was n't a long-term solution then and it is n't , now . 
  where the eu fails is speaking with one voice and acting , where the problem originates from . 
  people who only offer doom and gloom predictions but no solutions are not helping , either . 
  and speaking as somebody who lives in a city which has taken in a lot of refugees : they had little impact after the first confusion was resolved . 
  on the contrary . 
  that was what finally convinced the city to invest a lot into social housing and will drive down rent over the next couple of years . 
  should have happened 10 years ago , but , oh well , i 'll take it . 
  if done right , you can turn a lemon into lemonade . 
  i would n't call greece or italy as ee . 
  at least not in respect to the current migration paths . 
  in respect to certain madmen , then , yeah , that 's a border that ca n't be wide enough . 
  never know what kind of shit those apes fling over the fence . 
  that was the worst . 
  not only did sch\u00e4uble correct the german yellow press when they acted as if the first greek bailout was n't a european banking bailout . 
  not only that . 
  the tone was way , way off , too . 
  and all this fucking privatization . 
  i mean , what year is this ? 
  when has this ever worked in the long term ? 
  `` die welt '' is the `` bild '' for people who are n't afraid of grammar . 
  both are axel springer . 
  `` focus '' is babbies first `` der spiegel '' . 
  yellow press is never a good indicator . 
  otherwise we would be comparing , which bit of printed toilet paper had the worst titles . 
  it seems to be popular to montage ss uniforms into everything . 
  by now most germans know that the first bailout of greece was n't a bailout of greece but of european banks . 
  at this point a lot of people think that greece got royally fucked over . 
  also , the first link is about something that happened in 1827 , threatening a treaty in 1815 . 
  you are reaching quite a bit . 
  i 'm also wondering about that . 
  was germany issued a magical wand to make those people go away ? 
  ee did n't show any gratitude for what she did , tho . 
  i feel that the established treaties are unfair to countries with unfortunate borders . 
  most of which would be greece and italy . 
  it was mainly ee which did n't want proportional distribution of refugees since that would mean they would have to take any . 
  i feel she knows that and would very much like to change it . 
  or i may be reading too much into it . 
  and then there is the greengrocer 's contraction . 
  since you are bored anyways , could you please also look this one up for us ? 
  to me it seems she is so patient that she waits until public opinion swings her way and does what she wanted to do all along . 
  or i may be just reading too much into it . 
   the word for `` debt '' in german is the same as the word for `` guilt '' . 
  triggered !, 
  the german language is a lot more precise than that . 
  yes , that 's the one . 
  iirc he was asked why he did n't speak up against that claim since he knew it was wrong . 
  what followed was a bit of squirming peppered with some cringe . 
  what an immensely punchable man . 
  aw , come on !,
