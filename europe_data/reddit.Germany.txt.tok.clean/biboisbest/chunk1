porsche wanted to buy vw . 
  failed . 
  then vw bought porsche . 
  never saw that video yet . 
  you transport tanks on lorries in the uk ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4myxdtcucs ), 
  [ here is the prize . 
  your map looks like a leaking czech republic . 
  :p you did n't colour hamburg by the way , just saying . 
  how was your stay in the ijsselmeer ? 
  what did you do between weser and elbe ? 
  l\u00fcneburger heide ? 
   [ like this ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxj0h-scpc0 ), 
  if you drive through you see the autobahn , that 's it . 
  at least here in germany . 
  i 've seen less if you exclude the driving through part .

  [ guess where i 'm from ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/19c8n9l.png ) :  ** edit : ** [ map of regions where i stayed for 2 hours or longer . 
  no , you got me wrong . 
  it 's not illegal . 
  ( as long as the person is above the age of consent/none of the exceptions apply ) das habe ich noch nie geh\u00f6rt , und auch nach etwas recherche rein gar nichts dazu gefunden . 
   yet , it is still illegal to have homosexual sex between adult males and non-adults . 
  errm , no ? 
  since 1994 the laws make no difference by sexuality . 
  the age of consent rules are exactly the same for hetero - and homosexual people . 
  / u/thornfal did n't read the op . 
  he just read `` postcards '' and started a rant . 
  as always , if people would have some reading comprehension ( or at least would read the op ) , many ` problems ' would n't exist . 
  mate , did you even read the op ? 
  her story is covered by the dutch public broadcasting . 
  i heard mayotte is quite expensive ( not 100 % sure if true ) . 
  but if i had the money , mayotte seems really nice . 
  for the continent itself , i could imagine living on iceland , as well as on cyprus . 
  same with finland or portugal . 
  it really only depends on your attitude/mindset , imho . 
  personally , though , i would prefer a more moderate/colder climate . 
  but i always had a weak spot for portugal . 
  what is the coldest/greyest/most rainy part of portugal ? 
  willemspoort . 
  y u do zis ? 
   are there sentiments against the german minority ? 
  get the broomsticks ready !, 
  if you looked at the straight facts from the start and excluded all the propaganda and planned disinformation campaigns , you knew it since day 1 . 
  this is n't news at all . 
  the ` funny ' thing is , it 's not surprising what happened in the end . 
  i made a topic about this in the german subreddit ( / r/de ) ~ 40-60 minutes after the plane was shot down . 
  i tried to write down the known facts * before * the media massively jumped on the incident . 
  the result was , that it 's 99,99 % likely that the ` serparatists ' ( or irregular russian forces ) were responsible for this . 
  i also said that russian media/kremlin will start a massive disinformation campaign soon and make up several theories and stories to blur the facts . 
  that 's exactly what happened shortly after . 
  and no , i 'm not particularly intelligent or whatever . 
  * everyone * could have known this if he/she ignored all the media stuff who blurred the incident , and instead , looked only at the facts . 
  rolf kahn ( former bundesliga player and the father of oliver kahn ) . 
  [ kurt schumacher ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurt_schumacher ) was also from culm . 
  he 's ( at least in germany ) more famous than guderian . 
  according to a local newspaper , there were german exchange students from nrw on the plane . 
  coming back from a exchange . 
  :( seems true . 
  not even surprised . 
  seems to be gone again ... 
  it feels like the mods of this sub have a agenda . 
  same here . 
   and the debates they hosted nationwide tv ? 
  maybe that 's the problem . 
  they have to make a program for the whole netherlands , while the issues are only provincial . 
  in germany , no one knows what issues are going on in other states , let alone on a district/municipality level . 
  ( unless it 's a huge scandal ) this is the job of the local media , not the nationwide ones . 
  but yes , i agree the media failed then . 
  do n't you have local public broadcasting channels ? 
  is n't this stuff their job ? 
   all in all , i ca n't fathom why people wo n't use their right to vote . 
  agree . 
   vote blanko i 'm personally not a fan of this in a multi-party political system . 
  this is understandable in a political system like in the usa , but in countries like the netherlands there 's always one lesser evil you could vote for . 
  you ca n't tell me that 10 + parties are all the same level of shit . 
  you might not agree 100 % with anyone , which is normal , but somewhere out there , there 's a party you at least agree 40-50 % with . 
  but people are too lazy , they do n't read party programs , especially not of * all * parties participating in the elections . 
  the ones to blame are the lazy and naive people . 
  this . 
  i kind of agree , but then again , i kind of do n't . 
  not going to vote is a statement as well , means : i do n't fucking care . 
  so if people do n't care , it 's their fault . 
  they 're are ok with every result then . 
  if people do n't fucking care what happens with them , it 's their right too . 
  in a real democracy , there 's always the choice not to vote , as well . 
  and in a more self-centred view  the less people are going to vote , all the more my vote counts . 
  comeback of the upstalsboom ? 
  would n't mind . 
  at least it was the best marketing coup for a satire show in history . 
  i sure hope not , but if it 's a `` fake-fake '' , that 's what could happen . 
  no matter if the finger is fake or not , the coverage ( especially by the tabloids ) of the incident was disgusting . 
  greece is a european bielefeld ? 
   but then again it 's possible that he simply did n't remember making that gesture two years ago either way , that 's the most likely the case . 
  the problem is his handling of it , after the jauch interview he should just have been silent about it and try to verify if it 's real or not . 
  and when he 's 100 % sure , he could comment again . 
  but he did try to get his head out of there from the start , without knowing if it was fake or not . 
  it sure was out of context , so the jauch editors are to be blamed anyway . 
  but with varoufakis reactions , you could see he was n't sure himself if he gave the finger or not . 
  so , if real or not , * the editors of the jauch show are to be blamed for putting it out of context .
