i can \u00b4 t help but notice that ( a ) the author obviously wants to make no waves . 
  he basically sees no problem and only finds reason for this leak in vote-hunting ( b ) this article is buried underneath a pile of articles deep in the economics section ( while an article on airbus \u00b4 problems with some wings is front page material ), 
  with all those news about troika and the list of biggest issues , i \u00b4 d like to add that on monday the first bitcoin bank opened its doors in cyprus . 
  here are pictures from the grand opening : http://imgur.com/a/irzck#0 and more information : http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/1z18fh/update_from_neobee_on_the_grand_opening_of_neo/ this should be very interesting to follow how this plays out in cyprus , as it is quite the match for a movement away from traditional banking . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  this was an event that got a lot of media attention from around the world , but more importantly in cyprus . 
  the feedback was huge and the company , neobee , is ambitious to do something for the people . 
  i \u00b4 d like to know what makes people downvote this information . 
   in other words , german trade with the ezone is balanced . 
  i \u00b4 m citing your source : german exports to ezone : 1097 billion * 0.375 = 411 billion german imports from ezone : 909 billion * 0.376 = 341 billion 411b-341b = 70 billion germany has a deficit of 70 billion , no ? 
  in the ezone alone . 
  edit : format, 
  fair enough . 
  no i \u00b4 m not . 
  western germany . 
   is that why you want to defend russia 's actions ? 
  what makes you think i want to defend russia 's actions ? 
   and is it true that many people in former east germany want to leave nato and reform the a warsaw pact style alliance with russia ? 
  well the only party that openly wants to leave nato is `` die linke '' and they are a party that kind of evolved out of the ddr and still has a lot of voters in the east , although that doesn \u00b4 t mean they want to reform the a warsaw pact style alliance with russia . 
   the ship is reported to be carrying as many as 200 soldiers and has joined four additional ship carrying an unknown amount of special forces troops . 
  ( ... ) however , it is believed that russia 's sevastapol base cotnains as many as 26,000 troops ( ... ) . 
  since we had this topic yesterday ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1yj5ia/the_hypocrisy_of_this_subreddit/ ) although with '' ? '', 
  instead of '' !, 
  '' , i thought this would be a good exhibit . 
  it \u00b4 s a screenshot from the thread about `` madrid blocks catalan vote on independence '' http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1yivsr/madrid_blocks_catalan_vote_on_independence/ do people here actually deny that there is an increasing desire for independence ? 
  there are parties gaining more attention in pretty much every eu member state , also or especially true for the `` core members '' . 
  so we \u00b4 re just going to ignore that here on r/europe ? 
  how about adressing the issue instead of downvoting and thus ignoring . 
  according to the 2013 eurobarometer , most respondents in greece ( 89 % ) , italy ( 78 % ) and spain ( 77 % ) believe that their voice does not count in the eu . 
  this has allowed the spread of new anti-establishment movements , which unlike smaller eurosceptic parties in northern europe , do not base their platforms on nationalism and sovereignty . 
  1 . that \u00b4 s not at all what i said 2 . you can \u00b4 t really deny that in a lot of eu countries a desire for independence is rising . 
  that \u00b4 s just stating a fact . 
   and here we go ... 
  denying a democratic vote will only fuel the desire for independence just like with the eu, 
  upvote for you !, 
  1 . use proxtube or something 2 . this is not political censorship for this particular video , but the result of a conflict between gema and youtube . 
  youtube basically blocks anything that * might * infringe copyright just to make double sure . 
  obviously gema sucks for putting them in this position , but i wouldn \u00b4 t call it political censorship . 
   furthermore , the gema takes action against the arbitrary switching of the barrier panels on youtube . 
  these suggest falsely that gema would be responsible for the blocking of the videos on youtube . 
  therefore , the gema requested youtube in january 2013 to refrain from the use of locking plates . 
  because youtube did not comply with this request , gema followed the legally prescribed way and handed an injunction suit in district court of munich .

  i agree and would say that what s.w. 
  meant ( and what i basically agree with ) doesn \u00b4 t mean we can \u00b4 t all be right . 
  the coziness has created/is responsible for circumstances that allowed what you describe to happen . 
  economic injustice leads to more extreme voters kind of thing . 
  if people have work and make a good living they won \u00b4 t be looking for a scapegoat of their misery . 
   thats an insane statement , far-right parties gained momentum because of anger over immigration . 
  the far-right do n't even care about banks . 
  are you sure ? 
  it was what s. wagenknecht described as  brussels is too cozy with banks and corporations < what caused a lot of suffering in greece , spain , portugal etc. 
  and in those countries the people start getting sick of the eu . 
  so banks/corporations/politicians being cozy definitely contributed to the rise of momentum in for the right wing . 
  on top people who don \u00b4 t like the coziness probably don \u00b4 t like the $ too much and that is common ground with nationalist movement which makes it in general fairly hard to critisize the $ without having to deal with a lot of prejudice . 
  s. wagenknecht knows this very well and we had an incident here in germany last month where she was in a talk show and the host very aggressively tried to ridicule her and not let her make a point . 
  ( can \u00b4 t really put s.w. 
  in the right corner like the others ... ) it was pretty bad and resulted in a shitstorm and an online petition to get rid of the guy ( markus lanz ) with close to 250k signatures . 
  anyway , i think the coziness is more than part of why right wing parties gain momentum and i don \u00b4 t like what i have to see . 
  it \u00b4 s dangerous , but no end in sight really . 
  come on ... the guy asked what that has to do with anything and i ( briefly ) explained u/flailing _ junk ` s comment to him . 
  i am not recommending anything . 
  the first thing anyone will tell you on r/bitcoin is not to invest money that you can \u00b4 t afford to lose and that \u00b4 s for a reason . 
  second thing would be to do your research to know what you \u00b4 re dealing with . 
  that is a pretty reasonable approach and if someone sees benefit in bitcoin he or she might start using it . 
  if not then not . 
  but believe me , a lot of people all over the world see benefits in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general . 
  remittances might be the most obvious one . 
  once the infrastructure is there people working all over the world can send money home for 1 % fees instead of 11 % ( around this is what westerunion etc. 
  charge on average is of the $ 550 billion dollar market - $ 414 billion of which go to developing countries . ), 
  this is going to put more money direcltly into the hands of those who most need it . 
  this is the most obvious benefitious usecase scenario , but there are many more . 
  i agree bitcoin is not in a stage where you can seriously rely on it with your fortune or even at all for most people . 
  at the same time it \u00b4 s not getting all this attention for no reason and the technological innovation behind it will proof quite disruptive in a lot of ways . 
  edit : this is a pretty good presentation on how bitcoin can change the remittance market https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=j8jutmfuxuu#t=767, 
  this could not happen to you if you use bitcoin . 
  no one said they \u00b4 d be using the boats against people exposing corruption etc. 
  however , selling weapons to people who make laws that treat exposing corruption as terrorism is something i \u00b4 d rather see my government not explicitly supporting !, 
  this was published on the same day as the nyt article on  saudi arabia put into effect a sweeping new counterterrorism law sunday that human rights activists say allows the kingdom to prosecute as a terrorist anyone who demands reform , exposes corruption or otherwise engages in dissent . 
   we had a far right demonstration in paris . 
  it did regroup many revendication but it was mostly racists and nutjobs do you mean [ this one ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lefigaro.fr%2factualite-france%2f2014%2f02%2f02%2f01016-20140202artfig00212-la-mobilisation-contre-la-familiphobie-ne-faiblit-pas.php&amp;sandbox=1 ) or another one ?

  youtube is a private company and if gema wants youtube to follow a set of rules that threaten their business model , they simply block those videos in germany and the german cosumer is the one who suffers .
