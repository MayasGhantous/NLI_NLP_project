  it was all along ( the link i posted ) . 
  use proxmate, 
  i think you got that right :  in the long term and after treaty changes , an ** emu-wide fiscal capacity with a shock absorption function ** could complement existing policy coordination instruments .

  here \u00b4 s a german perspective you \u00b4 re not going to find in msm : http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rationalgalerie.de%2fhome%2fkrieg-in-mali.html&amp;sandbox=1, 
  the german public really doens \u00b4 t want to get into wars so as usual the germans will only be `` helping in different non-combat ways '' to make sure our politicians can keep saying that germany is not attacking anyone . 
  they just provide intelligence , weapons , maybe a littele peacekeeping . 
  are you in kiev ? 
  do you mean to say the laws that allow using real bullets are being printed right now ? 
  so are those rubber bullets ? 
  i can recommend proxtube for firefox . 
  still annoying though . 
  this is the best example ... i want to follow the events in kiev and gema is stopping me from watching a live stream that has no copyrighted audio or video . 
  wtf ? 
  yup . 
  blocking what feels like half of youtube , it \u00b4 s fairly annoying . 
  `` let me finish ! '', 
  i would have lost it ... 
  this would be the real reason and it makes sense that he sticks with protocol . 
  it would still be pretty awesome to see him simply ask away and not care about any consequences though . 
  and honestly , the whole world would applaud . 
  freedom of speech !, 
  i agree with you and that is why i don \u00b4 t get what the author is trying to say ...  and it is absolutely clear that issues such as the financial crisis can be solved * without * enormous integration to the european union i don \u00b4 t even see these issues being solved * with * enormous integration . 
  so how is it clear that they can be solved * without * integration ? 
  i \u00b4 m on a horse . 
   and it is absolutely clear that issues such as the financial crisis can be solved without enormous integration to the european union please elaborate . 
   ( not saying that the crisis can be easily solved * with * integration . 
  it \u00b4 s not so clear either way i \u00b4 d say . ), 
  i didn \u00b4 t mean to express any judgement on the process of getting in this situation in either direction . 
  i was commenting this part especially :  it probably will happen in other countries if they behave like greece it doesn \u00b4 t matter if they behave like greece or not . 
  since we all share one currency and our economies and the whole banking system are very connected and so on , these problems don \u00b4 t just stay in greece . 
  you realize greece also has the $ and a lot of debt , right ? 
  the economies of all eurozone countries are well connected and problems might very well spread from greece ( even more than they already have ) . 
  for a more elaborate outview have a look at this http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41173.0 the imf has been openly suggesting all sorts of interesting actions that probably will be taken sooner or later . 
  interestingly enough there are quite a few german doctors who moved to uk . 
  maybe some british doctors come to romania to go full circle :d, 
   ... it is clear that governments should be careful in their assumption that growth alone will be able to end the crisis . 
  instead , today 's advanced country governments may have to look increasingly to the approaches that have long been associated with emerging markets , and that advanced countries themselves once practiced not so long ago . 
  full paper can be found here : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41173.0 i linked the article , because most people probably wouldn \u00b4 t want to read so much . 
  yeah it \u00b4 s not as simple as that and there are many things influencing one another . 
  a vicious circle . 
  i \u00b4 d imagine the youth unemployment would be even higher ( in % ) if 1mio ( i pulled this number out of a hat ) young spaniards had not left the country . 
  reading through the other comments supports that view - and after all that \u00b4 s why many of them left . 
  same goes for berlin with spanish , greek , french , italian ... quite amazing to think how many young people have left already and still more than 50 % can \u00b4 t find a job : /, 
  haha , wtf ? 
  they actually did that ? 
  stockholm has to be one of the nicest cities in europe ( on earth ? ), 
  to arrive at by sea though !, 
  you know what ... it might actually be the better move for lithuania , i don \u00b4 t know enough about lithuania to come to a conclusion here . 
  however , the guy is basing his hope on false presumptions . 
  what it comes down to is this statement that he bases his argument on :  euro-zone has proven its strength , because all the problems that appeared so far have been solved look around my friend ... also un-pegging is a lot easier than leaving the euro-zone, 
  i wonder if he actually believes all that ... 
  thanks for clearing that up !, 
   seems to only benefit germany * seems * is the important word here . 
  average hans is not benefiting from this . 
  the low unemployment rate is numbers game - wage stagnation and all sorts of creative accounting to get a number that makes things look not so bad . 
  and this is not even mentioning all the liabilities/debt coming towards us with this mess . 
  i can recommend it and it doesn \u00b4 t go against what you \u00b4 re saying . 
  he was wondering about those reserves as well and puts it all in context with greece becoming part of the euro-zone . 
  he actually went to greece and did quite a bit of research because it was odd that while greece in debt over their head and at the same time they didn \u00b4 t accept a pretty good deal that they were offered about those resources ( something along 50 % profits , 90 % of jobs created going to greeks and so on ) . 
  i found this ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eqnzpzi9rw check it out , but also read the book !, 
  sorry i don \u00b4 t understand . 
  what about africa ? 
  and why do you have a hard time believing him ? 
  from your posts i take it you \u00b4 re german or at least speak german . 
  have you read `` showdown '' by dirk m\u00fcller ? 
  it \u00b4 s a pretty great book that also deals with greece \u00b4 s resources and your question . 
  hate to say it , but trying to find answers you \u00b4 ll probably end up in r/conspiracy . 
  he did anyway . 
  ridiculed or ignored by msm . 
  source : common sense . 
  simple common sense . 
  holy shit . 
  what a retarded point of view you have . 
  i wonder what makes you think this way . 
  1st paragraph : do you realize they also won \u00b4 t let ngos and journalists sit in ? 
  why should anyone trust big business with these secrets but not partys that have a far more unbiased view on things ? 
  2nd paragraph : we all know how that works out ... like anyone of the parliament has time to actually read thousands of pages . 
  and even if , they would probably only understand parts of it . 
  they probably get the documents the night before the voting , just like they did in germany with the esm 3rd paragraph : bs !, 
  can \u00b4 t really take my time right now , but in the eu votes are not equal so no more needs to be said . 
  ok i realize the term inflation can be meant in different ways ( money supply/consumer prices ) . 
  while i agree that banks don \u00b4 t loan money to small businesses thus keeping the money supply form inflating ( while accumulating huge amounts of cash !, 
  ) , there \u00b4 s definitely inflation in consumer prices : energy , rent , goods & services . 
  i \u00b4 m in germany btw . 
  and that \u00b4 s where it hits average joe/hans , so it \u00b4 s the bad inflation . 
  and this is also where the `` neutral basket of goods and services '' is no good indicator for inflation because it \u00b4 s intransparent and rigged to make it look better . 
   he does . 
  mortgages are cheaper . 
  people over here rent , and rent is up insanely in all major cities . 
   any sensible form of retirement or social security features indexation . 
  i \u00b4 m not sure what you mean here . 
  i \u00b4 m sure that it \u00b4 s some mechanism to make these funds less vulnerable to inflation ? 
  i don \u00b4 t see it playing out . 
  also keep in mind all those government bonds they \u00b4 re * safely * holding . 
  greece , ...  so they 're not experiencing direct disadvantages from inflation ( rising prices ) . 
  like hell they do . 
  if you spend 75 % of your income on rent , energy and food it \u00b4 s gon na hurt big time when prices for those things go up . 
  if you \u00b4 re rich and you spend 1 % on those things while 90 % of your income derives form renting/investing in financial products that appreciate like hell you \u00b4 re loving this scenario .
