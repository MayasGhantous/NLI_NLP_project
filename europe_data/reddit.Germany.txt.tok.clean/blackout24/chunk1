most visible difference is the lack of d\u00f6nerbuden . 
  i for one welcome our new low oil prices . 
  who would want to have a bunch of vertically challenged politicians with cancer ? 
  well even as a southern german you 'll be noticed in austria , when you order an apfelsaftschorle . 
  birth place of the creator of the republican elephant , democratic donkey , unlce sam and santa clause : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_nast carriages that almost every queen , king or emporer in europe drove around with : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landau_ ( carriage ) also a car design : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landau_ ( automobile ) grand-father of anne frank lived here . 
  biggest wine growing communtiy in germany remains of a french fortress from the 30 years war : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/festung_landau biggest reptile zoo in germany . 
  those are also not a product of the recent ukraine crisis . 
  they started early 2013 as far as i know . 
  france is also not too bad . 
  just as much as germany while being a smaller country . 
  we should give more !, 
  there are esa members and they fund it but some of it comes from the eu directly . 
  the budget is tiny btw . 
  our national broadcasting alone collects 8 bn $ every year through a fee that everyone has to pay if he is able to receive public broadcasting ( this includes internet streams so if you have a smartphone you must pay ) . 
  it 's 18 $ / month per household . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_space_agency#member_states_and_budget 4 billion $ buys you a train station in stuttgart . 
  nasa budget is 3 times that , but still very small . 
  it 's just a hobby of industrialized states . 
  did we bring a flag ? 
  buy a gripen ! '', 
  uhm and why did n't they build a denis ritchie monument ? 
  you know . . c and unix ? 
  good luck finding anything that does n't use c or is n't a unix-like os like android , mac os or all the other applications of embedded linux in all parts of life . 
  if steve jobs made modern computers mass popular , why are they all running windows ? 
  i know `` omg bill gates stole everything !! '' . 
  fact is computers did n't become mass popular , because apple was selling overpriced hardware . 
  personal pcs became mass popular , because microsoft let manufactures have their hardware price race to the bottom and they only had to license window to sell it as a complete pc . 
  actually all dutch people i have met here ( i live in a popular holiday destination ) all speak good german . 
  german was good . 
  not astonishing but it had more of a finnish tone to it than french and english . 
  by tone i mean which syllables he pronounced more and the overall rhythm . 
  why the fuck would you even build a memorial for steve jobs in russia ? 
  jobs did nothing more than to to sell shiny stuff . 
  i think i 'd prefer adopting the gay pride flag over the second one . 
  count me in . 
  the flag of europe wikipedia page is quite interesting . 
  glad we did n't end up with this one : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:former_flag_of_the_international_paneuropean_union.svg or this one : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe#mediaviewer/file:union-europea_segun_rem-koolhaas.svg, 
  well they can look ( observe ) but do n't touch !, 
  looks fugly imho . 
  a bit like a prison somehow . 
  gypsiephobia ? 
   ok , so what 's the politically correct word of the month now ? 
  i think it is `` maximum pigmented '' . 
  cut russia of from swift already . 
  and this might actually happen : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyd9xu92zsg, 
  i hope their tourism industry sees a nice boost from this as a payoff . 
  would be a good sign for other north african countries , too . 
  i had a good laugh . 
  [ relevant simpsons clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyd9xu92zsg&amp;feature=youtu.be ), 
  dude is kind of digging it . 
  she not so much ... 
  i wonder what their thought process was to come up with wanting to go to serbia on vacation . 
  nothing against serbia , but thats not your typical trip to europe for someone from the u.s. 
  german : together with wind of change by the scorpions probably the anthem of german unification : [ marius m\u00fcller-westernhagen - freiheit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbk6kwfj_x4 ), 
  you forgot [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdl-k9egswe ) . 
   `` the first man who , having fenced in a piece of land , said `` this is mine , '' and found people na\u00efve enough to believe him , that man was the true founder of civil society . 
  from how many crimes , wars , and murders , from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind , by pulling up the stakes , or filling up the ditch , and crying to his fellows : beware of listening to this impostor ; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all , and the earth itself to nobody . ''  - jean-jacques rousseau, 
  low . 
  exactly east asian immigrants are probably the most respected here in germany . 
  they send their kids to school . 
  they learn our language . 
  they respect our laws and do n't demand special treatment . 
  they are n't lazy . 
  they keep their religion private . 
  same ca n't be said about all immigrants from middle eastern countries . 
  yeah , because russia would start a full on war they ca n't win over this . 
  they 'd cry and shake fists and never do it again . 
  how about some new sanctions to help their economy back on its feet ? 
  you know according to russians the sanctions will make their economy stronger . 
  what else ? 
  seriously just tell them that the next one will be shot down . 
  see what they 'll do . 
  even if they attempt it again and get blasted out of the sky they ca n't do anything . 
  they could down one of russias planes and russia could n't do anything about it other than to shake its fist . 
  is there really a 2 % minimum spending requirement ? 
  quite a lot spend less of their gdp than that . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/d%c3%b6ner_kebab.jpg that 's the typical image of d\u00f6ner in germany and france . 
  never found something like that in turkey . 
  kadir nurman found out that germans do n't have time to eat a platter of d\u00f6ner kebap so he put it into a bun and adjusted it to german taste . 
  the modern form ( which is the object of hate for french far-right ) was invented by [ kadir nurman ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kadir_nurman ) . 
  he died not to long ago . 
  the d\u00f6ner kebap sold in europe has nothing to do with what you 'd get in turkey anyway , since it was invented by a guy in berlin . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsbv3fge4eu martin sonneborn from the satire party `` die partei '' asked g\u00fcnther \u00d6ttinger if he wants to support the `` right to forget '' as as commissioner for digital economy and society . 
  he then asked how he will make sure that the following things wo n't be deleted accidentally . 
  he then list a couple of pretty embarrasing statements and facts about him . 
  to top it all off he added `` please answer this question in english . 
  '' , since he is known for his [ denglish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88ogxlfpemw ) .

  shhh this thread is about eu countries ... ;-), 
  ** luxembourg : ** probably the most european place on earth . 
  you can speak pretty much any language and people will understand you . 
  it 's like a french , german , belgian melting pot with a bunch of brits and portuguese thrown in . 
  i love your clean streets . 
  you can practically eat off of them . 
  we had a russian couple spying in germany a couple of years ago . 
  they went by the family name `` anschlag '' like `` terroranschlag '' ( terrorist attack ) . 
  i shit you not . 
  written finnish always looks like someone facerolled his keyboard . 
  1 % political activism 99 % attentionwhoring .
