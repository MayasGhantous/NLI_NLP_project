  if switzerland has a high number of millionaire household you got ta wonder how the rest are doing , [ when 50 % of swiss adults have 95.000 usd ** or less ** after debt . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult ) anyway it became pretty clear that you ran out of arguments rather quick , when you had to bring up `` omg you just jealous !!!! '' . 
  funny if anything germans should be jealous of people from luxembourg . 
   how do you end up with this conclusion ? 
  they have the highest purchasing power in europe . 
  they can buy more than anyone else in europe . 
  as the link you posted said . 
  purchasing power seems to a mere 15 % higher compared to luxembourg when you compare the big cities . 
  sometimes it even comes down to 0 % . 
   why are germans so jealous of the swiss ? 
  says who ? 
   getting millionaires to spend money in your country definately helps the average joe . 
  how ? 
  average joes still has to be able to buy all the stuff to live and most average jobs simply do n't create enough wealth to pay for that . 
  the average joes is n't a business consultant . 
  you see the same thing in luxembourg where a lot of regular people drive to neighbouring countries just to be able to afford the stuff they need to live . 
  swiss are n't even trying to be rich as it looks like :  http://www.statista.com/statistics/299394/billionaires-per-capita-top-countries/, 
  who cares about absolute wages if you ca n't buy anything with them ? 
  great a lot of millionairs move to switzerland to save taxes like michael schumacher that really helps the average joe . 
  well no they are n't . 
  wages are one thing . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult if you account for debt and remove all the michael schumachers who live in switzerland , but are n't actually swiss and just want to save taxes the median swiss person is n't actually that well off . 
   if you look at the last link you will see that wages more than make up for it . 
  yeah by a mere 30 % or 15 % if you compare luxembourg to z\u00fcrich . 
  so much for :  wages in switzerland ** are actually nearly double that of those in luxembourg . 
  and cost of living is 50 % higher ... 
  for me it 's [ eguisheim ] ( https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=eguisheim ) . 
  but i 'm geographically biased . 
  ehh no . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28nominal%29_per_capita people earn a fuck ton in luxembourg and in addition to that most things are not that expensive . 
  it 's not like switzerland where you have to sell your kidney to get a coffee . 
  things like gasoline , coffee are even cheaper than in germany . 
  we had a vietnamese-german vice chancellor for quite a while . 
  he was popular as a rockstar in vietnam . 
  actually luxembourg is a counter example to that . 
  they 're just as rich but i found people from luxembourg to be pretty chill and friendly people . 
  and they have like 40 % immigrants . 
  looks like snowden has a point here : http://www.thelocal.ch/20130627/snowden-trashes-racist-swiss-on-chat-site  `` i have never ever seen a people more racist than the swiss jesus god they look down on everyone , '' he wrote , according to arstechnica . 
  `` even each other . '', 
  maybe you guys should invent snow football that has to be played on skis . 
  while listing to rock music . 
  you can say about the drone program what you want but al-qaida absolutely fucking hated it according to the intel they gathered after they killed bin laden . 
  pretty sure that d\u00f6ner outsell currywurst in germany . 
  not to be confused with fhritp voting . 
  i know who gets a visit from the police soon . 
  their facebook page got pulled today . 
  you might find it in some google cache ... yes they had a facebook page with 300 fans . 
  so it 's ok now if we spy on the french , because the nsa told us to ? 
  hitler himself . 
  ~ ~ finnish ~ ~ conscription in a nutshell . 
   rally in moscow organized by zaldostanov , popular slogans included `` we do n't need western ideology and gay parades ! '', 
  `` death to us cultural imperialism !!, 
  '' ... unless it 's biker subculture which started in the united states !, 
  i wonder if they even ride russian made motorcycles . 
  interesting that you have bikers in russia . 
  everyone know that [ bikers are fags ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gx1q-hqxqa ) . 
  it thought russia was pretty homophobe . 
  and the inefficiency of tax collection . 
  maybe they subtracted the amount of money they spend just to maintain their nuclear arsenal which is 10 % of the budget iirc . 
  only ~ ~ players ~ ~ pc gamers !, 
  looks like they adopted that stupid holi festival hype . 
  `` hey lets throw some paint around without understanding the history of this festival . '', 
  if the data is accurate i would have expected us to score higher compared to others . 
  there are many popular linux projects/events that originate from germany ( kde , suse , knoppix , linuxtag etc. ), 
  might be a belarusian submarine ? 
  looks like you need a visa to enter the eu ... huh ... who would have thought . 
  if you had the iq of a bowl of borscht that logic would make sense to you . 
   of course if they do n't visas they should n't be allowed entry in the eu well they do n't . 
  they tried to scam some but they have been canceled . 
  why should we let people enter without visas ? 
  good , lock them up and sell them back to russia . 
  nope . 
  i saw the whole film . 
  people simply create their own understanding of things based on knowledge constructs they already have and derived from everyday observations . 
  a kid for example knows that when he/she puts something on a table it stays there . 
  if they put something on the bottom side of a soccer ball it falls of . 
  so the earth must be more like a table . 
  that 's because they lack the construct of gravity , which they than integrate into their understanding of the world . 
  guess how the understanding of the world evolved in the last 500 years ? 
  you 'd be surprised how many misconceptions you have ? 
  the world is full with them `` metal is colder than plastic '' , `` trees suck the water out of the ground with their roots '' `` water evaporates in the tree leaves which causes water to be sucked up through the tree '' etc. 
  this is exactly right . 
  nope these are physics graduates : https://youtu.be/trxaqu_qgeo?t=1m53s i watched the full version a few years ago . 
  they even asked the professors and they got it wrong . 
  nothing special . 
  most harvard physics graduates think the seasons are created by the sun being closer to the earth during summer than during winter . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trxaqu_qgeo this has nothing to do with people being stupid or that they did n't learn it in school . 
  people have all kind of misconceptions which they bring into the classroom . 
  these are never addressed in class so instead of accepting the scientific model they integrate the new information into their old misconceptions . 
  more misconception on how trees get their mass : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njwxyz4grya, 
  more like 60 % . 
  til i live in some kind of underwater rugby mecca . 
  you are right . 
  had to take a closer look . 
  yes maybe a hint more european than russia considering all the french , irish , british and german influence . 
  how about south and central america ? 
  how strong would you rate the spanish and portuguese influence ? 
  basically the whole world ( minus china , india , japan , africa , middle east ) is european . 
  the district of trier and the saarland are light blue wich means over 45 % . 
  highly doubt that the western part of rhineland-palatinate and the saarland has over 45 % youth unemployment .
