  edit : yup , that 's bullshit . 
  i 'd say about as much as the united states . 
  reminds me of `` pulver-kurt '' ( gunpowder kurt ) a few years ago . 
  if they want to do that they should fly some nato flags just for fun . 
   the reality is they 're unlikely to be granted asylum , they will be sleeping crammed into a tiny flat with tens of migrants doing illegal jobs for far less than minimum wage , i think they know this and the problem is that this is still better than living in somalia . 
  obvious kremlin shill with his one day old account is obvious . 
  you are n't even trying to do a good job . 
  you 're an embarrassment for all the honest hardworking shills out there . 
  what would putin think of you ? 
  good job wasting your precious time on earth . 
  how are seats allocated in the parliament ? 
  is there some kind of minimum amount of votes a party has to get ? 
  it looks like there are 9 parties in the parliament , right ? 
  how low can you go ? 
  build some bridges from north africa into russia and the united states and drain some refugees there . 
  alll refugees of the world could probably fit into russia easily . 
  unhcr says over 50 million people are fleeing their countries worldwide . 
  there 's only one real austrian rapper : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcfm-vwuqrk, 
  maybe if they all line up on the the shore and paddle towards the united states . 
  that blonde could occupy me any day . 
  this is not that unlikely . 
  guess who worked for valve software once ? 
  it just tries to blend in . 
  yes , but i would argue that a large portion of germans use these to interchangeably . 
  i first thought it was this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presidential_state_car_%28united_states%29, 
  yes , krankenwagen is more regularly used . 
  it 's a the colloquial version of rettungswagen . 
  1 % political activist 99 % attention whore, 
  and the end result is that gas prices will be lower . 
  that gazprom retard has no clue how bargaining power works . 
  :d good lucking trying to force higher prices if the eu is a single customer , which means russia loses over 70 % of their income if the price is simply rejected . 
  looks like cgi . 
  i hope they do n't ban the vatnik meme . 
  tsipras should give putin some flowers for starting a war in ukraine that lead to the death of over 250 dutch citizens and thousands of ukrainians . 
  would n't even surprise me . 
  no they simply got lost . 
  i know i just wanted to rub it in . 
  dutch successful national soccer team, 
  you only have to look at how it crated a shitstorm when it was proposed that french kids should maybe also go to school on a wednesday . 
   russia still produces a lot of excellent music , cinema and tv . 
  i could n't even mention a single one of them . 
  the only russian music i know are the gays and lesbians they sent to eurovision contest ( dima something and tatu ) . 
  i for one would welcome our [ 20-30 usd oil barrels .

  i read them this way : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh, 
  interesting that russia up until 5 years ago still denied this massacre . 
   in november 2010 , after the crash or shootdown of plf 101 the russian state duma approved a declaration blaming stalin and other soviet officials for having personally ordered the massacre . 
  too bad nato has enough stand-off weapons in its arsenal to take care of them . 
  an a-10 would turn a tank full of russians into borscht real quick . 
  no i mean we can stop the russians only for so long with our broomsticks . 
  [ right .

  maybe the army of mali can teach us a thing or two . 
  we are their neighbors . 
   it certainly was n't made to fire that many shots in a short time . 
  what time span are we actually talking about ? 
  basically 3 magazines spray and prayed on full auto one after another ? 
  hk 416 's for everyone !, 
  unless they have that issue , too . 
  might have to ask the norwegians . 
  streukreis makes it sound likes diameter . 
  the guy who gave us obamacare in 1883 . 
   that diversifying domestic economy really comes in handy when the times get rough . 
  which will take decades . 
  sure is better than being deployed to afghanistan . 
  ehh i thought you should never cross streams ...

  and kartoffelsalat is male of course . 
  how can i make my 18 $ / month public broadcasting fees go directly to stuff like this . 
  :d unfortunately probably only half as funny if you do n't understand german . 
  even a hamster would have learned by now . 
  and your average taliban/isis fighter is not going to walk away from a center mass hit from a 5.56 anyway . 
  russia has a lots of empty space . 
  whats up with russia coming up with silly ideas every day these days ? 
  just like their supersonic , hybrid , 200 ton transport aircraft . 
  http://rt.com/news/242097-pak-ta-russian-army/ some one should educate them about the concept of drag . 
  something that 's counterproductive when you want to go supersonic . 
  lol all those butthurt russians in the comments . 
  someone should calculate , when spain and france will have swapped places . 
  rt news : russia intercepts swedish plane over baltic, 
  russians blindly follow anyone who is in charge . 
  critical thought has been brainwashed away many decades ago by constant propaganda . 
  split personality . 
  putin is a lot more retarded than i thought . 
  east germany dragging us down ... 
  there is no plural in german . 
  raktenwissenschaftler raketwetenschappers no exactly same length .

   but the people who support them are , and they will be more than happy to jerk off to the idea of russia invading another country . 
  this tells you how much their lives have to suck in russia . 
   except :  barely no russian minority ... yet . 
   what matters more is the content of a tank - the electronics , optics , the guiding system , `` smart ammo '' etc. 
  you forgot `` an experienced crew '' . 
  here is another person claiming it is a double fake . 
  https://jonnykrueger.de/47/varoufake-luegt-jan-boehmermann the red frames are actually in the youtube video if you look at it with rowvideo . 
  he played an equally epic prank on our most successful entertainer stefan raab , too . 
  haha japanese are awesome .
