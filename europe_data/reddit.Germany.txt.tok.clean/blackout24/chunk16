  they did surprisingly good at the geography and history part . 
  now someone make a list of the trailing main battle tanks of the world . 
  socialism is like a reverse midas . 
  everything it touches turns to shit . 
   that other countries not forced to partake in the sanctions sell them to russia now as a middle man did n't work for belarus and a lot of the sanctioned on the financial sector ca n't be middlemaned . 
  in germany you can fuck whoever you want ( unless it 's a child ) , but fuck you if you do n't pay for your own coffee as president !, 
  new sanctions would not be necessary . 
  it would be enough to keep the current ones in place and they would squeeze the life out of the russian economy in the mid - / long-run . 
  probably varoufakis 's own money . 
  our leos run on canola oil . 
  actually our ministry of defence is n't in berlin for example . 
  it 's in bonn . 
  same goes for our ministry of science and education . 
  we clean up after ourselves and recycle all the waste properly . 
  ww3 will be the tidiest war ever . 
  does the uk have enough prison cells for all of them ? 
  that 's a bit over 2 % of the entire country , btw . 
  longest coup in history . 
  would he be mummified like lenin ? 
  for me that sounds a lot more reasonable . 
  putin is pretty good at damaging russia , why should they replace him with some hardliner to do it better ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swan_lake apparently this was often played on tv when leaders died to calm the population . 
  how do you say l'\u00c9tat , c'est moi !, 
  in russian ? 
  probably shoygu like in every good military coup . 
  maybe we know more about their cows than the swiss do ... 
  haha that crab ... :d, 
  pretty l33t . 
  have fun being downvoted by truckloads of americans . 
  putin will finally have his coming out . 
  [ russian media released this photo today proving that putin is alive and healty . 
  ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2008/11/02/08putin_wideweb__470x385,0.jpg ), 
  how come other countries do n't like to party ? 
  i 'd like to know that , too . 
  does something make salento special ? 
  any major influx of people from outside in the past ? 
  we can discuss after 900 ok ? 
   latvian food is potato . 
  pretty much bild zeitung in germany . 
  i 'd say if they arrest 1000 more traffickers we let them into the eu . 
  i 'd go for the alien baby story . 
  he dead yet ? 
  you mean the pakistani and indian food you get in london ? 
   besides , russia would n't work as a democracy . 
  it 's simply too big . 
  russia is tiny compared to democracies like the united states or india , lol . 
  india is at the same time way more diverse than russia . 
  maybe putin joined isis ? 
   why is support for eu membership growing ? 
  i always thought icelanders did n't want to have much to do with the eu besides a free trade agreement . 
  i thought so too . 
  especially , because they would probably have to accept eu fishing quotas etc. 
  iirc that 's one of the main problems for iceland . 
  we should be a little bit more efficient when it comes to football semi-finals and finals . 
  we come in second or third too often . 
  yes in 2012 . http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/vladimir-putin-limp-health-rumours, 
  lenin died on january 21st , though . 
  i think we should just transfer our defence spendings directly to the us . 
  we will once we got our money from the french for napoleon and from the swedes for the 30 years wars . 
   if i were president i 'd be careful about appointing you as a foreign policy advisor i think that 's about the last thing i care about , random person on the internet hypothesizing being a president and appointing imaginary advisors . 
  well that concept of power did n't really play out for russia . 
  :d the worst is yet to come for the russian economy . 
  ohh too bad ukraine is a sovereign country and does n't have to ask for permission from another country if it wants to do something . 
  you think putin asked ukraine everytime he did something ? 
  ehh ukraine was about to sign an agreement with the eu . 
  the same agreement we have with countries like chile . 
  why is n't russia invading chile ? 
  zomg expansion !, 
  yes but we always have enough brooms with us . 
  that 's because you 're doing it wrong : http://youtu.be/sbbbwuk5yne?t=29s, 
  this actually has a name : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_disease, 
   except putin is greatly improved russia 's economy since he first took leadership . 
  everyone could have done that . 
  overlay the price of oil over this and see what you get . 
  a trade agreement is much worse than war for russia . 
  the wealthier everyone around russia gets the more russias middle class will realize how incompetent putin is . 
  putin does n't fear nato invading russia one day he fears his own people rattling on his throne . 
   if putin diversified the economy , so that it did n't rely hardly on natural resources , he would be in a much better position than he currently is in . 
  putin ca n't create companies and jobs . 
  that takes entrepreneurs to do it . 
  diversifying the russian economy would be a task that would take many many decades before showing any effects . 
  or do you think russia could build competitive cars or consumer electronics over night ? 
   also it 's a chance for young people to get out of their comfort zone/bubble and get some real life experience be it in military or civilian service . 
  i would be all for it if it would n't discriminate against men . 
  back in my day guys had to either wipe asses or crawl through the mud while girls went on vacation to australia and new zealand after finishing high school . 
  good at least one part of the west still has some sort of spine . 
  the english stole one from us so it balances out . 
  should be `` five times football world champion '' really . 
  four times football world champion . 
  military power would be diffused . 
  if there is only one army for country a and b , b ca n't invade a anymore . 
  yeah especially luxembourg . 
  luxembourg city which is 20 % of the population is basically a bank . 
  you get the impression that everyone there drives a porsche .

  written finnish looks like someone rolled his face on his keyboard . 
  so many double characters . 
  they are necessary . 
  why is russia so desperate ? 
  i do n't know i only remember rebels deleting their twitter post where they proudly announced that they have a buk system .
