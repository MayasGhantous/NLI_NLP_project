  after mh-17 they deleted it ( but it was still google cached ) and claimed they are n't even able to shoot down a plane at that alltitude with their manpads . 
  pretty much what everyone was expecting just 2 hours after this tragedy happened and russian separatists deleted evidence of having a buk system . 
  good luck . 
  our mod would spend that on childcare places for soldiers and stuff . 
  we had to cut the hours that we fly our typhoons because of faulty british parts ... http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-02/eurofighter-deliveries-put-on-hold-following-bae-fuselage-fault, 
  which is funny , because in the west putin is being compared to hitler . 
  so everyone who opposes putin is literally putin . 
  you can still see the results of the 30 years war today . 
  there are large parts of germany that are mainly catholic or protestant , while in the palatinate it changes from village to village . 
  what has the eu ever done for use ... / s, 
  how do you become a terror expert ? 
  do you need job experience as a terrorist ? 
  that will teach the turks !, 
   but they did give a % per household to that chart , which makes it clear that germany ( 3.5 % ) pales in comparison to luxembourg ( 22.7 % ) , switzerland ( 13 % ) , netherlands ( 9.1 % ) and belgium ( 8.5 ) for the muslim population chart they however left out the per capita perspective , which would put france first . 
  and who would have guessed that the largest country by population also has the most millionaires in absolute terms . 
  yes they sometimes have videos entirely in english with professional speakers like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpdbjgrkolm ) . 
  they should do that more often when it 's about multinational collaboration . 
  doubt any foreigner is that interested about childcare services in the german army . 
  the german armed forces youtube channel has some good videos about the collaboration with the dutch navy and army .

  ~ ~ germany ~ ~ bavaria, 
  yes today you would use the word `` wunderlich '' . 
  fucking westerners pressured putins cronies into laundering money in off-shore firms in panama . 
  which is why even today germany is more decentralized than for example france . 
  nw germany is also pretty empty . 
  there is only bremen . 
  northern germany is pretty empty . 
   such a coward . 
  recurring theme with islamist terrorists . 
  good job belgian police !, 
  the harpoons that failed to fire and were supposed to anker phiale to the comet were also swiss-made . 
  now open an umbrella . 
  nope . 
   which it is nope . 
  because no law would allow that . 
  yeah lol it 's not like right wing politics is n't at all defined and it does n't match the afd perfectly . 
  :d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right-wing_politics edit : ahh just let the butt hurt flow through you . 
   can anyone tell me why afd is far-right ? 
  i understand that you may dislike afd , as i do because of their sentimental vision of russia , but why call them far-right ? 
  maybe because their leaders are openly racist as fuck ? 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/opinion/the-new-face-of-racism-in-germany.html because they think it would be a great idea to open fire at women who are trying to cross the border ? 
  because they congratulate other far-right parties like the french front national for their success in the elections ? 
  maybe just produce less milk then ? 
  yep that 's bullshit that the afd is n't that far right , lol . 
  you just have to listen to bernd h\u00f6cke ( who is clearly [ racist as fuck ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/opinion/the-new-face-of-racism-in-germany.html?referer=https:/www.google.com/&amp;_r=0 ) ) and beatrix von storch ( thinks that it would be ok to shoot at women at the border ) for a little while . 
  so at what point would a bridge get closed off for traffic in russia ? 
  after it has collapsed ? 
   if you get your view of germany exclusively through this subreddit it is likely to be skewed . 
  yeah who would have thought that reddit is n't representative of anything other than reddit itself . 
  education is a matter of the individual states . 
  it was never forbidden . 
   at least germans can buy this crap now , because for decades this wasn \u00b4 t possible , because of laws and german phobia even now in 2016 nazi theme is taboo . 
  mein kampf was never banned in germany . 
  there is and was no law against it . 
  yes i think converts somehow think they have to prove themselves and want to be more muslim than real muslims . 
  hence , they are more radical . 
  why not just use google maps ? 
  usually cards are tailored to the specific market so that makes sense . 
  for americans acceleration matters more for german top speed matters more . 
  i think for china they change the suspension to match the road conditions . 
  well just buy more stuff from us . 
  we ca n't just ship stuff to you if it was n't ordered . 
   are we supposed to dump it at the border ? 
  yeah because projections 70 years into the future ever worked out . 
  but they 're not made from potato . 
  would sp\u00e4tzle count as pasta . 
  how is past ~ ~ e ~ ~ a defined ? 
  skyrim belongs to the nords !, 
  ironically homosexuality is n't uncommon even among taliban . 
  http://www.utne.com/media/photographs-of-taliban-groomed-affectionate-guntzel.aspx also they have this disgusting boy sex thing going on in afghanistan ( bacha bazi ) . 
  yes just throwing money at problems has worked in the past . 
  everyone loves mutti . 
   only the federal agencies are allowed to use it . 
  unfortunately , because it looks more badass imho . 
  maybe he needs to defrag his brain once . 
  you can see the plasma here : http://www.ipp.mpg.de/de/aktuelles/presse/pi/2016/02_16, 
  a medical disseration is basically the same as a master 's thesis in terms of length . 
  but you get to call yourself dr. 
  i think you misread my comment . 
  unfortunately working with people is n't paid well even in western countries . 
  sounds like someone wants to lose another jet . 
  yeah putting facts straight makes you sound bitter , lol . 
  said the guy who could n't make a single valid argument . 
  :d i hope you do n't start to cry now . 
  it 's pretty entertaining to see how you continue to embarrass yourself . 
  no it does n't happen . 
  :d yeah i know basic statistics and know that the margin of sampling error is n't independent of the individual percentages . 
  ahh best saturday morning entertainment i had for a long time . 
  http://www.langerresearch.com/moe/ the margin of error around a 1 % poll result is only 0.6 percentage points at 95 % confidence . 
  you you simply do n't seem to understand the difference between percent and percentage points lol . 
  so according to your logic 3 percentage points is within the margin of error irregardless of the actual base . 
  a party that is forecasted to get 1 % of the votes might aswell get 4 % . 
  yeahhhhh right . 
  no percentage points differences are n't written as x % in the polls in the polls i posted . 
  no 3 percentage points . 
  again math is hard . 
  http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/ are you blind ? 
  sure if the afd has 10 % ( 10 out of 100 ) in most polls and 13 % ( 13 out of 100 ) in another that 's 30 % more ( ( 13-10 ) / 10 ) * 100 . 
  learn to calculate . 
   a 3 % discrepancy from other polls is usually margin-of-error stuff .
