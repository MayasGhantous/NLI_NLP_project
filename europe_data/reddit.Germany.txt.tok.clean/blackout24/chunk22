  why are should 27 smaller armies with 27 mods and 27 military procurement plans and 27 budgets be better ? 
  the us would be more than happy with a unified eu army . 
  they can think of better thinks than having to protect europe with its military . 
  they could focus on the pacific instead . 
  the thing is that it 's an assault rifle not a light machine gun . 
  it 's not built to fire 600 rounds in one go to suppress the enemy . 
  if you use it as an assault rifle it 's an excellent rifle . 
  it 's a bit like buying a ferrari and complaining that it 's not good for shopping and when you have 3 kids . 
  france already offered sharing nuclear weapons with germany . 
  probably hoping that germany would help pay for the cost , which is 10 % of the french defense budget , iirc . 
  someone should organize a burkini flashmob in this city . 
   but right now ? 
  not really source ? 
  also sanctions were enforced before the plane was shot down . 
  she went against public opinion with that one , and it will hurt cdu in 2017 . 
  majority of the population supported sanctions against russia according to infratest . 
  you mean the privately held company deutsche bank ? 
  good . 
  no longer true . 
  which cool castle is it referring to ? 
  i have been to echternach but did n't see the jumping procession . 
  nice little town . 
  i parked on the `` kack '' ( shit/shitty in german ) parking lot which was pretty funny . 
  they actually know that he got it from the darkweb . 
  the gun is from slowakia . 
  he was german . 
   but it still provides further that diversity and multiculturalism do n't work in favor for western societies . 
  how so ? 
  german kids also went on a rampage , because of school bullying in the past . 
  someone did a good transcription of the video on / r/de . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4u3jnq/offenbar_sch%c3%bcsse_im_oez_m%c3%bcnchen/d5mvrsg it 's pretty accurate . 
  the gunmen says he 's from the `` the hartz iv ( welfare money ) region . 
  the turkregion in hasenbergl ( poor part of m\u00fcnchen ) '' . 
  he also says that he was `` bullied for 7 years '' and was `` in inpatient treatment . '', 
  definitely not an immigrant he speaks perfect high german . 
  he says `` because of people like you i was bullied for 7 years . '', 
  maybe you mean `` selbstgerichtet '' ( self is english ) . 
  the term is uncommon you 'd more likely say `` er hat sich selbst gerichtet . '', 
  is n't that what bfe + was created for ? 
  on average less than 5 people die per year from terrorist attacks , while 3500 die in traffic every year . 
  do you shit your pants every time you sit in a car or bus ? 
  yeah lets just tell the gunmen everything about the police operation . 
  brilliant idea !, 
  apparently all injured are from a hong kong family . 
  hope they get well soon . 
  holy shit his teeth man on the thumbnail when the video ends . 
  i 'm from a small town ( around 45k population ) with 45 uk citizens living here . 
  a week ago the local newspaper said that the first one already became a german citizen after the brexit vote and that around a dozen requested the necessary documents to start the naturalisation process . 
  with khedira , gomez , hummels and a healthy boateng maybe . 
  was rooting for france until ronaldo had to go with his busted knee . 
  congrats portugal !, 
  would have happend anyway ... 
  their chance are rather good considering many of the top german players are injured . 
  gomez wo n't play . 
  khedira and schweinsteiger is questionable . 
  hummels misses this match , too . 
  `` hey waiter please bring me some pizza ! '', 
  `` here is your pizza sir ! '', 
  `` you moron i actually wanted pasta i only ordered pizza out of protest ! '', 
   but why ? 
  if we said tomorrow , `` hey we are staying '' - what is wrong with just carrying on as if nothing happened ? 
  you ca n't force us to sign away our privileges can you ... 
  considering that the uk is too scared to actually leave the eu for real and is deeply divided ... yeah not the best negotiation position to be in . 
  it 's not like the people of the uk just gambled away all the extra deals that cameron negotiated just before the referendum . 
  they can kiss their special snowflake status good bye . 
   especially if uk push their luck too far . 
  considering their whole referendum gamble blew up in their face i would n't be counting on luck if i were the uk government . 
  yeah which would be started by invoking article 50 . 
  they could start next week . 
  jokes aside i think dublin is in the best position . 
  well then lets see how the uks gdp develops if scotland and maybe northern irland decide to leave . 
  is n't she commander in chief ? 
   europe 's second largest economy third largest . 
  france surpassed you yesterday . 
  because the queen was elected by god ... duh !, 
  i think direct democracy can be fine , but on a much smaller level ( local community ) . 
  on a national level the issues are so complex that the average joe simple does n't really have a clue what he 's really voting for . 
  you could let people have a referendum about ttip and you 'll get some result , but personally i would need to look into the details for a month daily before i could comfortably form a real opinion . 
  but . . but . . the immigrants !, 
   just because it is a democratic decision , does not make it a smart decision . 
  this . 
  people get hung up on the whole `` wisdom of the crowd '' thing way too much . 
  there is also `` stupidity of the crowd '' . 
  mentally ill person . 
  nothing that unusual . 
  yes the ministry of the interior of the state of hesse confirmed it . 
  he did n't surrender he 's dead . 
  gunman is already dead . 
   we 'd only shoot ourselves in the ~ ~ foot ~ ~ head . 
  should have been written in comic sans . 
  we always had quite a number of russians seeking asylum in germany . 
  nothing really new . 
  https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationfile in 2013 they even accounted for the most asylum applications out of all top 10 countries that people came from . 
  jack wolfskin jacket and backpack ( or the north face ) , sandals and white socks . 
  probably a moshpit . 
  at the end of the video i still do n't know why i should buy one . 
  called it btw . 
  just saw our song for the first time ... fuck !, 
  last place here we come . 
  nothing ever stopped anyone from providing an installer that just puts some statically linked files into / opt with all their dependencies .
