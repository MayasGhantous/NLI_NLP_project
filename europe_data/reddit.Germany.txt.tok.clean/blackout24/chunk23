  there are only only around 6-8 % muslims . 
  of course many people never had contact with a muslim . 
  that 's just math doing it 's thing . 
  there is also a shitton of infighting going on in the afd . 
  still more people than at trumps inauguration . 
  it 's the sweetener that can give you the shits if you eat large quantities . 
  also applies to a lot of bubblegum . 
  one of the better ones if you ask me . 
  he was asked about eurobonds a week ago on ard or zdf . 
  he first paused for a second and then said something like `` eurobonds are a thing of the past . '', 
  did n't sound that convincing when he said it . 
  i studied together with a croatian girl she filled every stereotype . 
  she was an ultra catholic meat devouring beauty . 
  great idea to attack a place which is guarded by soldiers . 
  dumbest terrorist ever . 
  probably never heard about never bringing a knife to a gunfight ... 
  tum was also the only pod that actually traveled the entire distance . 
  http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/ insa hilariously overrates the afd and underrates the cdu . 
  what a coincidence that the ceo of insa is very close to the afd . 
  die linke + solutions = does not compute, 
  you do know that the uk is still part of the eu and its single market ? 
  we germans would have the best nuclear weapons . 
  more people than at trumps inauguration . 
  so why did n't she trigger article 50 ? 
  every part of germany is older than germany ... 
   how are you going to identify whether a claim is bogus before you have processed it ? 
  kind of like the halting problem . 
  :d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halting_problem, 
  insa ceo hermann binkert is pretty close to the afd . 
  we do n't elect the chancellor . 
  we vote for the party and a local representative . 
  the party with the most votes then has to form a coalition unless it has an absolute majority ( highly unlikely even for the two main parties ) and gets to propose the chancellor . 
  the parliarment then votes for the chancellor . 
  title reminded me of slingshot channel videos on youtube . 
  `` this is my refugee launcher 3000 . 
  let me show you its features ! '', 
  expats are immigrants with money . 
  the line between derangement and religious fanaticism is very blurry . 
  they do n't even have to speak german their local dialect is close enough so that they can communicate with people with allemanic dialects in germany . 
  why not \u00d6sterland ? 
  i do n't get it why we do n't strongarm the shit out of north african countries who deliberately refuse to take back their own people . 
  just threatening to issue a travel warning which would fuck up their only industry big time would be enough or to cut some of the 200 m $ they get in foreign aide . 
  do n't forget nordzucker and s\u00fcdzucker . 
  i wonder if there is an aldi s\u00fcd where you can buy nordzucker and an aldi nord where you can buy s\u00fcdzucker . 
  ehhh yes ... because he 's just that ... a suspect . 
  really strange you 're right . 
  they always said that they are investigating into every direction . 
  you really think they are that stupid ? 
  nobody thought that this has to be the guy . 
  people just seem to absolutely suck at reading news articles . 
  http://i.imgur.com/3qtx00z.jpg verd\u00e4chtiger ( suspect ) ! = t\u00e4ter ( attacker ) every sentence starts with `` soll '' ( allegedly ) . 
  he is described as `` mutma\u00dflicher t\u00e4ter '' . 
  nobody ever said `` hey we caught him !, 
  i want some of whatever he is smoking . 
  must be good shit . 
  yeah totally realistic that the afd gains +350 % more voters so that it can rule alone without having to go into a coalition , which is impossible because none of the other parties is willing to form a coalition with them . 
  as long as the cdu is the strongest party ( which it is by a long shot ) merkel will get another term . 
  trump had a 30 % chance according to prediction market and polls that 's not insignificant . 
  lol good luck . 
  i hope the whole carrier does n't sink and create an oil spill . 
  why should we want to live anywhere else ? 
  around 400 people drown in lakes and public baths every year in germany . 
  so in 10 years it cost around 4000 times as many lives as islamic terrorism . 
  damn bathing it is getting out of hand !, 
  count the number of people killed by islamists in the last 10 years in germany , please . 
  in 2015 some from the spd even questioned if they should put up a chancellor candidate at all . 
  pretty sure that the support in germany is higher than reported . 
  and the least favorable is spd/linke/greens , which is the only other possible coalition apart from another grand coalition . 
  schmidt and brandt also where spd chancellors . 
  yes life in germany is absolutely terrible . 
  good luck , lol . 
   ` defecation in the vehicle will incur an extra charge ' how much is it ? 
  wait you would n't rather have clowns like trump , berlusconi , boris johnson & co. run your country ? 
  i dislike how she handled the controversy around the g36 , which turned out a lot of fabricated bullshit like everyone expected . 
  i also never understand why people compare the amount of material that russia shelved and mothballed against the number of active tanks etc. 
  in european armies . 
  well we also have mothballed leos . 
  isis : `` we did that ! '', 
  no way steinmeier would want to lose against merkel , again !, 
  he already lost against her in 2009 . 
   major trading partner russia is n't really a major trading partner . 
  we even trade more with switzerland . 
  around 8 % . 
  til 5.5 million guns = 0 guns, 
  sounds like the setup for a `` your mom ... '' joke . 
  i have never seen a voting computer in germany . 
  i 'd say it 's very unlikely that the cdu will be able to form a government alone . 
  most likely coalition is another grand coalition cdu/spd . 
  after that maybe cdu/fdp . 
  less likely cdu/fdp/greens . 
  people found out that martin schulz is just yet another boring spd candidate after all and nobody knows what he really stands for . 
  they paid for her of course they want some kind of return on investment ... 
  but ... but ... but ... the refugees !, 
  crooked marine !, 
  i know i 'm just mocking people who are bad at statistics . 
  but . . but ... brexit and trump ... 
  he should have invest in some crypto currencies instead . 
  it also sounds like he took a loan to buy the options . 
  inspried by [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zzn4o/the_last_supper_finland_edition/cpo4ppn ) about characteristic facial features of finnish people i thought this thread could be fun . 
  i always found that some footballers look very sterotypical , just like wayne rooney has `` england '' written all over his face .
