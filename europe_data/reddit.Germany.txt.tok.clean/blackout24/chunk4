  a youtube video that is available in germany but not in other countries ? 
  that 's a first . 
  we are n't even allowed to watch livestreams here on youtube . 
  100 % english cotton . 
  all of them do n't cost you any money since they do n't air on ard/zdf & co. 
  i do n't care what rtl & co. do . 
  they do n't steal from me . 
  there 's more with this came from , putin !, 
  our crime shit mostly comes from denmark , england and sweden together with countless polizirufs and tatorts and sokos . 
  i counted 20 individual crime thriller series on ard/zdf . 
  i have seen the 16 mbps 4k stream . 
  beats the pants off zdf/ard 720p . 
  no i prefer 1080p and 2160p which i will get with netflix . 
  1080i is basically as bad as 720p . 
  well the thing is that nobody has to care what the private channels do , since they do n't rip you off 18 $ / month . 
  nobody wants interlaced crap anyway . 
  to make it even worse you still have to watch tons of ads on ard/zdf since gez obviously is n't enough . 
  the ads are either `` if you poop too much take this product '' or `` if you do n't poop enough take this other product '' . 
  if you like to watch crime thrillers all day monday through sunday or cooking shows german tv is great . 
  german tv is also great if you have an ancient tv which is n't even able to display 1080p let alone 2160p so you do n't mind that all channels only broadcast 720p . 
  guess they ca n't afford proper equipment from the 8 billion $ s they earn every year through state legalized theft . 
  got ta spend all that money on swedish crime thrillers and quiz show prizes . 
  do n't know why someone downvoted you . 
  really torrenting is the dumbest way to get copyrighted content . 
  the are dozens of companies that simply join the network and log the ip of everyone who connects to them for upload or download . 
  after that these ips get handed over to the respective lawyer who is able to get the address from the isp and send you a nasty letter . 
  a friend of mine torrented something on the 1st of the month and had a letter in his inbox 4 days later . 
  it 's about 30 % and we have large reserves which would last for months even if they 'd cut it 100 % which they wo n't . 
  well you can never get out more energy than you put in if you make the energy storage yourself ( like jet fuel ) . 
  the only reason you can more energy out of burning coal than you put in is , because the energy inside the coal was put in by the sun ( like all energy forms on earth ) . 
  a few hundred million years ago plant matter harnessed the sun to grow and was turned into coal by pressure and thermal energy from the earth . 
  by burning it you get some of that energy back , but not more . 
  you make a profit when you can produce something at lower cost than what people are willing to pay for it . 
  if you have a process that creates fuel at 3 $ / l you do n't make a profit no matter what when the market price is lower . 
  you have to be as cheap or cheaper than the current best method ( which is just drilling holes ) to make a profit . 
  it 's boils down to that as with everything the efficiency is n't 100 % . 
  you have to input energy to convert your input into output . 
  it 's simply cheaper to drill a hole into the ground and suck some oil/gas out rather than to make it yourself it . 
   the estimated cost of the fuel is projected to be between us$ 3.00 and $ 6.00 per gallon ( us$ 0.79 - $ 1.58 per liter ) and that may be something of a problem because the current price of jet fuel is about $ 3.30 per gallon ( $ 0.87 per liter ) , which makes the nrl product potentially almost twice as expensive . 
  there is a lot that is technically possible but economically infeasible and that 's what matters in the end . 
  so you need to develop methods to make it more efficient , but there is still a theoretical upper bound to how efficient it can become . 
  this requires research which requires money which nobody wants to spend when you can just drill holes . 
  or you need drastically cheaper power available to reduce the cost of producing fuel this way . 
  you can even make fuel out of sun light ( energy ) and air ( mostly water vapor , co2 etc ) , but with horrible efficiency . 
  assad should be more than happy if the us bombs isis in syria . 
  isis is fucking his army and conquering his airfields . 
  looks like we have to bust out the fischer-tropsch synthesis once again like in ww2 . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fischer%e2%80%93tropsch_process if only we had a super cheap energy source like nuclear fusion we could make all our hydrocarbons from seawater ( h2o + co2 [ dissolved ] ) and be competitive with regular extracted and refined gas and oil . 
  that northern german shale gas ... 
  it feels very much like a german/french meltingpot just like my [ home region ] ( http://www.eurodistrict-regio-pamina.eu/pamina/spip.php?article1488&amp;lang=en ) . 
  we have a separatist group in baden w\u00fcrttemberg ? 
  maybe he wants to date merkel ? 
  did n't he have a divorce not to long ago ? 
  poor guy probably only wants to be loved . 
   in a 2007 news story , abc news reported , `` in a country that lost more people defeating the nazis than any other country , there are now an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 neo-nazis , half of the world 's total . 
  http://abcnews.go.com/nightline/story?id=3718255&amp;page=1#.ucdbiaa4sui http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-nazism#russia now you could argue about the validity of the abc news numbers , but no matter how you put it there is a pretty sizable neo-nazi scene in russia . 
  i guess the russian line of thinking is that nazis are only bad if they 're from a different country . 
  i was more referring to the people that will handle our milans and panzerfaust 3s . 
  will look like this : http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e30_1409334144, 
  you guys do n't need rifles you need [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdxamet14iq&amp;list=pldhiiuisxwxzlvifhpt5orgeo1ewz6p7y&amp;index=2 ) fucks up 40 russian tanks in one go . 
  simply impose real sanctions , which would lead to a total economic collapse in the short term . 
  putin would bail the fuck out of ukraine faster than the average russian downs a shot of vodka . 
   and what 's worse is the majority of russians actually believe it . 
  says a lot about a country when the only thing holding it together seems to be propaganda and lies . 
  the data for germany is misleading . 
  the yellow spot should be the upper rhine valley not the black forest . 
  i 'd love to see the next world cup in britain . 
  germany vs. england final . 
  the world would be a a lot better if russians would simply realize that their country is just one out of 250 on the planet . 
  you do n't see the portuguese and dutch crying every day about how big their empire was in the 15th century . 
  no , but after east ukraine it 's enough !, 
  really !, 
  just like hitler was satisfied after taking austria and after that the sudetenland . 
  no we 'll let russian have their try this time . 
   26 years after wwi was lost wwii was started to rectify wwi . 
  looks like 26 years after the cold war was lost wwiii will be started to rectify the cold war . 
  sadly it will probably require another war before europe realizes that it has to unite into one country . 
  can we now start sanctioning russia back into the bronze age ? 
  you can only counter boldness with boldness . 
  freeze putlers personal assets and cut russia of from the financial markets . 
  jup pretty sure the cia paid every person on the maidan 1000 usd to be there . 
  maybe we should send them some polish apple baskets ? 
  i 'd welcome a new round of sanctions . 
  maybe just freezes putins assets this time . 
  i 'd prefer canada over kazakhstan . 
  at least their 're more aligned with our culture and values . 
  well if they 'd act like deserve to be a member of it ... at little less annexing a little more human rights , a few less journalists in prison and we can talk , 
  should have a boat full of drowning refugees in the mediterranean sea for accuracy . 
  well but russia always claims they do n't have a hand in this ... 
  personally in that case ( getting involved in combat indirectly ) i 'd prefer just bombing them with jets and attack helicopters . 
  at least all the weapons you brought to the region would be back at home , once you return . 
  good luck getting any of these weapons back ever . 
  especially small arms where getting ammo is n't as hard as for anti tank missiles , which might be supplied to the the kurds . 
  small arms will just end up everywhere . 
  there are quite a lot of german desserts . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_german_desserts this one is the biggest one : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lieberoser_w%c3%bcste, 
  [ our biggest desert ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/76624793.jpg ), 
  10/10 would build . 
  imagine if all countries considered as `` the west '' like the eu , usa , canada , australia , new zealand would merge into one mega country . 
  the best thing is how people believe we use words like weltschmerz or wanderlust .
