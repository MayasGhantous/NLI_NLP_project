  :d that 's like digging out some ancient word out of a shakespeare novel . 
  i actually want more . 
  pretty sad when the only thing holding a country like russia together is lies and propaganda . 
  kremlin bots are at it again . 
  :d http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/2dfkwp/russischer_appell_an_die_deutschen/cjp0rez, 
   undemocratic ? 
   at he risk of getting down votes ... not really ... erdogan won with a majority of votes ... 
  yes , because democarcy is all about voting right ? 
  freedom of speech , freedom of press , freedom of ( from ) religion . 
  pff who needs that ... 
  so will the rebels rename it to `` peoples republic of whatever city is left '' ? 
  well just join then ... , 
  well switzerland has a high rate of gun-related violence compared to the rest of europe . 
  best : all but switzerland worst : switzerland we like them all but the swiss are a bit wired . 
  very close-minded . 
  http://www.thelocal.ch/20130627/snowden-trashes-racist-swiss-on-chat-site they should take some lessons from luxemburg . 
  they are even more rich than the swiss and very cool and relaxed people and 10x less xenophobic , quite the opposite actually . 
  http://www.mixmarkt.eu/de/ i have one see one in my entire life , though . 
  not everything will be from russia , i think you can also find eastern european products there . 
  stop !, 
  you can get 1 gbps in any country if you pay enough money . 
  ftth is the magic word . 
  in germany internet via cable is usually 100-150 mbps . 
  vdsl is 50 mbps , but they want to do some vectoring magic to enable 100 mbps over telephone lines . 
  if you live in the middle of nowhere it 's better to get cable , since you mostly get what you ordered no matter how small your town is . 
  dsl drops of significantly the farther away you are from the nearest node . 
  why ? 
  germany : ** do n't ** just walk into someones house/appartment with your shoes on . 
  take them off after you entered through the door . 
  the owner of the house will tell you if it 's ok to leave them on . 
  finally . 
  yeah and to add to that they 're wasting their time . 
  like anyone would give a shit about their stupid comments . 
  they are so blatantly obvious . 
  i like italy . 
  easily the best sounding language , best food ( i do n't mean pizza ) , nice climate and full of great culture . 
  there is n't something called the [ florence syndrom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stendhal_syndrome ) for no reason . 
  nothing better than walking through some medieval fishing village and eating gelato at the harbor while looking at the sea . 
  just hold the next wc in brazil aswell . 
  at least they would get their moneys worth from their investments into stadiums etc. 
  this way . 
  well not even them . 
  no one thinks that it just crashed on its own . 
  it was hit by some missile from someone . 
  who actually still doubts that it was shot down ? 
  after the recent revelations i 'd just send a messenger ( a person ) to deliver such confidential messages . 
  why are n't the rebels using secure communications channels ? 
  exactly he invaded crimea , becuse he knew he 'll get away with it . 
  so he simply made a bold move surpring the rest of the world . 
  nato/eu could do exactly the same and send troops to his borded , because of this incident and he would n't be able to do anything . 
  at least we have a reason to send troops he just wanted to grab land . 
  so what 's the magic number then ? 
  how would you feel about knowing that your girlfriend , mother or father is lying somewhere in a conflict zone being mistreated by terrorists ? 
  would n't you want to be able to burry them in your hometown ? 
  well there are two common interpretations of this . 
  another one is `` if you have bad luck , be prepared for more '' . 
  * `` der teufel ist manchmal ein eichh\u00f6rnchen '' [ the devil is sometimes a squirrel ] the reason why something does n't work is sometimes in the detail . 
  [ holla the forest fairy ] in english you 'd say `` holy moly ! '', 
  it 's an expression of surprise . 
  * `` alles hat ein ende nur die wurst hat zwei '' [ everything has an end only a sausage has two ] everything comes to an end eventually . 
  you 'd call the outer parts of a sausage `` wurstenden '' in german . 
  * `` der teufel scheisst immer auf den gr\u00f6\u00dften haufen '' [ the devil always shits on the biggest pile ] something bad happens always to those who deserve it the most . 
  * `` gelegenheit macht diebe '' [ opportunity makes thieves ] you can say this to someone when he leaves his stuff unattended in public . 
  we could sanction them back into the stoneage . 
  yes our economy would suffer , too . 
  if that 's the price to pay it should be paid . 
  the longer we wait the more likely it is that it will be paid with the life of soldiers later . 
  it was a medium range aa missile , which takes a trained crew to operate . 
  it 's not like some stinger manpad you could give some goat herder in afghanistan to shoot down russian helicopters like the cia did .

  seriously . 
  even if that would mean my income declines by 30 % . 
  who gives a shit . 
  i 'll just not go on vacation next year . 
  there are more important things than my financial well being . 
  you 'll either send soliders to die or $ 's to die . 
  i 'd vote for the later . 
  pathetic pieces of shit ... 
  i have shown this video to a russian-german friend of mine without even asking for a translation and he told me that they 're celebrating . 
  i think cia and nsa live so much in their james bond spy games fantasy world , that they do n't realize that they 're not really helping the us . 
  `` omg everyone wants to destroy us and undermine our interests ! '', 
  really ? 
  brazil was never a good team during this world cup . 
  i really ca n't grasp how so many people thought that this is going to be a close match . 
  no neymar would have helped them . 
  cr7 did n't save portugal either . 
  they are simply not good . 
  they 're not western enough . 
  we should build more gigantic physics experiments . 
   the new nuclear power plants barely have any nuclear waste . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  even they 'd produce half the waste it would still have to be dealt with . 
   or i do n't know . . 
  built a rocket , fill it up with nuclear waste and shoot it in the direction of the sun . 
  that sounds cheap and safe . 
  not . 
  where would you put the nuclear waste ? 
  maybe putin should just think about why countries rather associate themselve with the eu rather than russia and then just work on that . 
  crank that thing up to eleven !,
