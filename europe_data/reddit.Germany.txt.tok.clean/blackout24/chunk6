  you mean fags ? 
  learned something new . 
  thanks !, 
  germany is ranked 33rd between rwanda and sudan when it comes to prosperity and equality . 
  makes sense . 
  of course every country has to maintain its culture and identity . 
  i was talking about welfare , fiscal , justice and labour market integration . 
  some things would still be handled by local governments , which have more knowledge about the local circumstances than a central european government . 
  rough idea . 
  nordic countries , germany + austria + benelux countries , united kingdom + france ( just joking :d ) , portugal + italy + spain . 
  i just think it would be easier to have smaller incremental changes for countries over time , which ulitmately lead to convergence between all countries than one huge integration . 
  i love it . 
  it would be a long process though . 
  we should first have more integration , between countries that are very similar to have just 3-4 blocks instead of 28 countries . 
  well not in south-west germany where i live . 
  northern german cusine is quite different from ours . 
  we make better potato salad for example with bacon , onions , broth etc. 
  in the north they make it with mayonnaise , eggs , pickeled cucumbers . 
  [ bismarkhering ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pickled_herring ) is a northern german dish . 
  northern germans also do n't have any asparagus which is huge part of the local cusine in southern germany . 
  no we do n't use linseed oil . 
  just potatoes with quark ( sometimes mixed with spring onions ) or just salt . 
  ohh boy grumbeere mit wei\u00dfem k\u00e4s ' we call it here . 
  so simple and so good !, 
  i 'd perfer it over every mcdonalds crap . 
  [ dampfnudel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dampfnudel ) in my part of germany they 're usually fried in a oil/salt water mix to give them a nice salty crust at the bottom . 
  served with either vanilla or wine sauce . 
  [ himmel und erde ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himmel_und_erde ) the wikipedia description and picture is n't very good . 
  often you have black pudding and liver susage slightly fried to bring out the spicy aroma . 
  goes well together with the sweet apples and onions . 
  literally heaven and earth . 
  [ kirschmichel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kirschenmichel ) the dessert consists of white bread buns that are a few days old which are kneaded into a dough with butter , vanilla milk , egg and sugar . 
  sour cherries are folded into the dough and the mixture is baked in a casserole dish . 
  served with vanilla sauce luke warm . 
  [ zwiebelkuchen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwiebelkuchen ) pie made with bacon and onions . 
  nothing more has to be said . 
  shit is really good with some new wine . 
  ** grummbeersupp unn quetschekuche ** potato soup with carrots , leek , bacon , celery [ the real one where you use the rootpart ] ( http://www.lecker.de/media/redaktionell/leckerde/warenkunde/hbv_20/knollensellerie_img_308x0.jpg ) , onions . 
  usually eaten together with [ zweschgen ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwetschge ) kuchen . 
  zweschgen are like better plums and english wikipedia does n't seem to know about them . 
  they have a sweet/sour taste and are put on a yeast , water , flour dough and you sprinkel some cinnamon on top . 
  while it is still warm you put some whipped cream mixed with suguar ontop of it , which then starts to melt . 
  this dish is literally sex . 
  [ zweschgenkuchen looks something like this ] ( http://www.backspielhaus.de/uploads/pics/dummy2_02.jpg ) . 
  [ saumagen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saumagen ) pig stomach filled with potatoes , spices , pork , sometimes chestnuts . 
  boiled and sliced and fried . 
  you usually do n't eat the stomach which is only the casing . 
  goes good togehter with some sauerkraut and white wine . 
  [ flammkuchen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flammkuchen ) think of it like a french/german pizza with very crispy dough , sour cream , bacon and onions . 
  nothing can go wrong with these ingredients . 
  obviously spain was n't the best team . 
  i heared that they 'll open a new mega brothel in saarbr\u00fccken soon . 
  did they hand out a stamp card , where the 10th blowjob is free ? 
  at least `` the west '' is n't undermining the sovereignty of ukraine . 
  in germany this kind of food is collected by `` die tafel '' and then sold for next to nothing to the less fortunate people in our society . 
  at least they did n't put it where the japan vs. cote d'ivoire game is . 
  yup , it 's all about the evil us as always ... let 's ignore the fact that there are n't any gas pipelines connecting the eu and the united states . 
  it 's strange , yesterday i cheered for the netherlands today i will cheer for england . 
   my guess is italy-england 1:2 . 
  and how is nato threatening russia ? 
  have n't heard of any recent plans of invading russia . 
  i 'm for the referee . 
  i 'd say the spanish can feel lucky it only ended 1-5 . 
  i cheered for every of your goals !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_caucasian_emirate that flag made me smile . 
  i appreciate you !, 
  i think it simply depends on what you are trying to dub . 
  i love watching south park in english , but the german version is really well done , too . 
  there are basically no puns that would not translate in to german , like with family guy which sucks balls in german for that reason . 
  it depends i 'd say . 
  nobody wants movies where the same guy does the voice of the male and female protagonist . 
  even if you prefer polish over russian vodka , you 're a russophobe who wants to destroy russia and start ww3 . 
  it 's like d-day in italy . 
  being 9 years old she 'll probably spend it all on candy and die from diabetes soon . 
  so it will not be that costly for the spanish taxpayer . 
  you have to graduate from princess college first . 
  you mean just like russia let people in chechnya dicide wheter or not they want to be part of russia or independent chechyna ? 
  oh no wait they simply bombed the place for years ... 
  i like how the guy behind obama thinks he has to treat obama the same way obama treats an 88 year old woman . 
  do n't know . 
  maybe ask putin . 
  nice . 
  gon na spend some days in lithuania next year i guess . 
  95 % of all statistics are made up on the fly anyway . 
  like this one . 
  it is n't in place anymore . 
  it was abolished a few years ago . 
  my physical examination was awesome . 
  i stayed up until 4 at night the day before ate some coffein pills in the morning , got on the train , first i had to pee into a cup ( filled it up to the brim ) and after that they tested my hearing . 
  i put on some headphones and had some pen like trigger in my hand and had to press it as soon as i started to hear a sound which got louder with time . 
  the woman was sitting in front of me so i asked `` well i 'll see when you push some buttons on your console ... '' `` you 'll see nothing '' so she pushed a button and i often waited a full second until i pressed my trigger . 
  i even missed some tones entirely . 
  :d after that i went to the doctor and pretended to be gay and afraid of spiders . 
  the last test was infront of a computer where you had to do some logical thinking , grammar and math tests . 
  i just pushed buttons and managed to get a c in the end still . 
  ended up t5 . 
  avoiding it was super easy . 
  you only had to get a certifacte from a doctor that you have an allergy or your knee is messed up . 
  in this case you were classified t5 ( tauglichkeitsgrad 5 , which is like capability level ) this meant you did not have to do anything . 
  in my school we had about 60 guys and only 1 guy did his service in the army because he wanted a few did zivildienst ( civilservice ) a lot ( like me ) just did nothing .
