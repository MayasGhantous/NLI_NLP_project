  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures here you can find purchasing power parity adjusted numbers . 
  i am . 
  there are things more important than my financial well being . 
  surstr\u00f6mming from sweden . 
  i learned dutch from this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmid7v3tejs, 
  berlin has way bigger internet start up scene , though . 
  yes the uk likes jews more than jews like themselves . 
  gun runs can be quite useful . 
   and last time i checked europe supported usa in every illegal or at least questionable action it took you mean like when france and germany did n't invade iraq with the united sates ? 
  so how many people got stoned in israel lately ? 
  how many anti-western terrorists got funded by israel ? 
  also why should the usa doing something should be an excuse to do the same ? 
  last time i checked the us was n't part of europe . 
  from what i heared in the news spain still needs an `` ok '' from germany in order to sell those licensed tanks . 
  our news actually made it sound like spain would produce these tanks anyway not germany . 
   `` more needs to be done since saudi arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-qaida , the taliban , let and other terrorist groups , http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/05/wikileaks-cables-saudi-terrorist-funding i 'd say al-qaida and the taliban are pretty anti-west . 
  you think we should supply tanks to countries that stone people to death and sponsor terrorism ? 
  this . 
  starting conflicts was always a popular way to overshadow domestic problems . 
  which would be ? 
  i first thought of the us state georgia ... 
   15 attentionwhores gathering and as many journalists taking pictures . 
  fixed that for you . 
  so what is putin doing to stabalize it ? 
  caricature in todays issue of our local newspaper `` die rheinpfalz '' : http://i.imgur.com/jx8aklg.jpg, 
  i think the use of the word racism is misplaced here . 
  maybe . 
  but racsim ? 
  you should look up what that actually means . 
  emphasis on `` keeping '' . 
  russian news sources are about as credible as the ones from iran or north korea . 
  germany simply is a big enough market where dubbing everything makes sense to maximize market share . 
  i think our public tv networks simply have to much money . 
  in germany you pay 18 $ / month per household for public broadcasting no matter if you watch tv or not . 
  if you can potentially watch some of it ( having a internet capable pc is enough ) you have to pay . 
  this way they raise close to [ 8 billion $ every year ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beitragsservice_von_ard,_zdf_und_deutschlandradio ) . 
  would n't be surprised if we show more swedish tv series than swedish television itself . 
  maria wern , stieg larsson , wallander , gsi g\u00f6teborg , camilla l\u00e4ckberg , arne dahl you name it we got it . 
  tons of danish crime thrillers , too . 
  we import craploads of crime thrillers from sweden for some reason . 
  it 's not like we do n't already have about 30 crime thrillers that are produced here ( about one for every major city . 
  i 'm not kidding ) . 
  i guess our biggest succes in terms of tv series export was : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derrick_ ( tv_series ), 
  kind of . 
  they start off saying that they agree that russian outside of russia have to be protected , but crimean russians where already way better of than the average russian in tver . 
  tver is a russian city . 
  people are upset that boatloads of money gets spend on crimea just for foreign policy and in the meantime your regular russian city is falling apart . 
  you might want to watch the youtube video the guy posted on his blog where the tram derails . 
  have you been to east germany ? 
  about a trillion euros ( solidarit\u00e4tszuschlag + l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich ) were poured into east germany post 1990 . 
  their roads are better than in a lot of west german cities . 
  i wish our media would report about something like this in the news . 
  in the 90s it might have been more common to say it instead of `` at '' , but people back then did n't need to use it that much . 
  personal internet usage was n't as widespread as today . 
  and do n't do it after the olympics . 
  wait , that would be was to easy . 
  they are propbably interested in the whiskey distilleries . 
  the us is also way more isolated from all the trouble spots . 
  we have direct borders with northern africa ( ceuta , melila etc. ), 
  and people from afghanistan , syria , iraq try to reach europe over the mediterranean sea or via turkey into greece . 
  so the overall situation is different . 
  to bad germany did not adopt this flag which was proposed as flag of west germany : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:german_resistance_flag_proposal_1944.svg we would have fit in quite well at least visually . 
  blame putins small penis . 
  no wonder his wife left him . 
  i think russia suffers from an inferiority complex after they lost the last cold war . 
  maybe he just wants to get hugged every once in a while ? 
  i think the whole surrender monkey bullshit started 2003 , when the french ( rightfully so ) did n't follow the us into iraq . 
  remember `` freedom fries '' ? 
  the real question is : which team would we send to the football world championship ? 
  yes i wonder why everyone is making such a big fuss out of it . 
  looks like they are just to much of a pussy to admit it . 
  citizen self defence force also has their own helicopters . 
  they built them out of old lawn mowers . 
  to blow shit up . 
  ** germany ** people got drunk this week in order to celebrate carnival . 
  luckly global warming is helping us :d i have not seen a single snowflake here this winter . 
  there 's something about olympics that makes dictators want to invade countries that once had ties with your country it seems . 
  you know after 4-5 shots of vodka you see double , 
  if it leads to a second space race i 'm fine with a second cold war . 
  we have some game devs , but no amd , intel , facebook , yahoo , google , apple , nvidia & co. 
  it comes down to spill over effects and depth of the labour market . 
  in an area like silicon valley you will find other specialized industries that are built around it ( it patent lawyers , venture capital firms etc. ) . 
  if someone quits his job at google he does n't have to move across the country to work at your tech company . 
  this way you also get information spill-over effects , since these workers still have some of that knowledge they acquired at their former employer . 
  universities also tend to be closely connected to the industry so there is a fresh stream of new talent . 
  would not call that fighting . 
  black friday in the us is more brutal . 
   russia simply has no diversification in their economy i do n't think they ever will . 
  even if they would lay all the ground work something like that will take way over 30 years . 
  you do n't become a global player in some industry over night . 
  they ca n't adopt the chinese model , since they do n't have a shit ton of people which are willing to work for 10 cents an hour and the european/american/japanese model is very knowledge intensive . 
  even europe ca n't create its own silicon valley and be competitive in that regard . 
  these are simply natural aggregation processes . 
  new it companies are created where there are already it companies . 
  and lets not forget about corruption and infrastructure ... 
  you 're quite good with the skiing i give you that . 
   yet people are still complaining ( and i 'd wager this is true for germany as well ) . 
  of course we do . 
  we 're germans . 
  i actually liked that mustache song from last year .
