he was ethnically iranian this is n't necessarily 100 % correct . 
  it is being reported that he is german-iranian which seems to suggest that one of his parents is german and the other is persian , making him as much ethnically german as ethnically persian . 
  the parallel stereotype in germany is usually polish people stealing cars . 
  100 % agreed !, 
  your original comment is incorrect regardless :  it 's forbidden to appear without such clothing in ** iran ** , and it is ** not forbidden in saudi arabia ** . 
  clearly it is forbidden in the ksa as well . 
  well touch\u00e9 , but that 's just semantics in practice ... 
  quote my misinformation please !, 
  i ca n't seem to find what you are referring to in my original comment . 
  i never stated such and such is fact , i wrote what the article stated and also made it abundantly clear that that is what the article states , not my personal knowledge or opinion . 
  mate , it 's not like the persian criminal code will state `` if some chick from germany visits on an official state visit it 's cool '' . 
  what are they going to do if a female minister does n't wear a hijab ? 
  if it 's e.g. 
  merkel ? 
  they wo n't throw her into prison ... 
  it 's kind of implied in the part that i translated in [ this comment of mine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5trpf9/walk_of_shame_swedens_first_feminist_government/ddones4 ) - though the implication might not have come across well in my translation . 
  i mean , i might be wrong ... 
  i 'm just translating what i read in the article . 
  i ca n't find an example either of a foreign woman not wearing a head scarf on a state visit in iran . 
  i 'd imagine that the persian officials put immense pressure - even more so than the saudi officials - on their visitors to wear hijabs , which would also be an explanation for why ann agreed to wear a hijab in iran . 
  i 'm just speculating though !, 
  i do n't know - who is ? 
  i did n't say that . 
  as i said , the law does n't count for foreign envoys in the ksa , as it does n't in iran . 
  it is forbidden for locals according to the article . 
  as i said , the article specifies that foreign envoys have a right to decide themselves what they wear in both iran and the ksa . 
   darum akzeptierte sie es , in dem islamischen land ihr haar zu verh\u00fcllen - sagte aber zugleich : \u201e mit dem kopftuch wird die frau entw\u00fcrdigt , verliert ihr menschliches antlitz und wird zu einem phantom . `` * the bavarian minister for economic affairs ilse aigner also made use of this right [ for foreign envoys to decide themselves what they wear ] when she visited iran . 
  the csu-politician decided , however , to wear a head scarf . 
  even though she would have preferred not to , as she admitted afterwards . 
  she * does * expect people coming to germany to respect their customs too , though . 
  * * that is why she accepted covering her hair in an islamic country - though simultaneously making the following statement : `` a woman loses her self-worth when she is forced to wear a head scarf , she loses her humanity and turns into a ghost . 
  it literally says it 's forbidden in the ksa in the article ** and ** that the law is n't compulsory for foreign female government officials ** both ** in iran ** and ** the ksa . 
  i know you probably did n't read the article since it 's in german , but making blatantly false statements with a seeming sense of absolute security makes no sense to me . 
  i have tried something similar in austria oddly enough . 
  it was delicious . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  til istanbul is in germany . 
  amri was n't a newcomer , neither were seven of the nine paris attackers . 
  do you support the second amendment ? 
  just curious . 
  ca n't tell if this is genuine or supposed to mock r/t _ d. 
  remind me again , what trends ? 
  one terrorist attack a year ? 
  i 'm sorry ; i seem to have understood you wrong . 
  i thought you meant the internal reddit search function above . 
   also , is there a reason turkish news are still in / r/europe ? 
  because part of turkey is part of europe ? 
  this is like asking why there are russian news in / r/europe . 
  use google and add `` site : reddit.com '' at the end . 
  you can also add / r / ... if you want to search a specific subreddit . 
  no free speech for genocidal maniacs, 
  how is making a sign with your hand a thought ? 
  golly jee , hitler breathed air !!, 
  breathing air must be inherently bad just because [ big evil man ] did it !, 
   doing something moronic that does n't hurt anyone debatable, 
  meten would be messen in german i assume, 
  what 's this `` abroad '' you speak of ? 
  what does one have to do with the other ? 
  everyone can do better when it comes to the planet . 
  you ca n't use `` but they are worse '' as an argument to deflect from your own weaknesses . 
  loving the tu quoque logical fallacies, 
  literally all millenials i know talk with anglicisms in real life , must be an age and/or location thing . 
  where do you live ? 
   too bad humans are n't purely rational actors . 
  what an interesting way to say you agree that terrorist attacks are no big deal !, 
   terrorism is already changing our society . 
  which cartoonist is still willing to draw certain caricatures for instance ? 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  i do n't get why you are trying to argue with me if you agree that any fear of terrorism is a phobia , because that 's really all i was trying to say . 
  which bridge is this ? 
  i 've only heard of the attacks on westminster and london bridge , one each ( ? ), 
  the likelihood of getting stabbed while crossing a bridge is far lower than that you die of a heart attack caused in part by fearing for your life every time you cross a bridge . 
   without fearing for my life london bridge is 269 metres long . 
  the average walking pace is 1.4 m/s , meaning it takes the average person a bit more than three minutes to cross the bridge . 
  there are 1440 minutes in a day , divided by three equals ~ 500 . 
  judging by the current satellite image on google maps there are roughly 60 people on the bridge at any given time . 
  500 * 60 people = 30,000 people crossing the bridge a day . 
  even if there was an attack like this one every single day , your chance of being injured in a terrorist attack by crossing the bridge at any single time would be 20/30000 = 0.07 % but these attacks do n't happen every day , we have had two in the past half year . 
  let 's say that trend continues , meaning 4 attacks a year . 
  4 * 20 injuries = 80 injuries per year if we assume an average of 30,000 pedestrians per day per each of london 's 33 bridges , you would have a million total pedestrians crossing the thames in london each year . 
  of these , we said 80 get injured . 
  80/1000000 = 0.008 % chance of getting injured by crossing a bridge at any given time . 
  would you say this is a rational fear ? 
  should i ask the same for the fear of getting injured at a concert ? 
  hey !, 
  i assume you meant to reply [ to me ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6c99vk/the_shortest_international_bridge_in_the_world/dhub1yh )  ahhh 1 million refugees that 's fine ... 1 million predominantly muslim refugees to add to the millions of turks already there . 
  i do n't see the problem ... is the fact that they are muslims enough for them to be inherently bad ? 
  afaik the refugees have had a lower homicide rate than natives and they input more into the economy than they take out . 
  i agree that the sexual attacks were absolutely horrible and preventable , but i have n't heard of any for quite a few months so it seems like the refugees are assimilating ( at least in that respect ) and if that 's the case i really do n't see any other disadvantage to them being here . 
  not to discredit the severity of the sexual attacks , of course ...  merkels got you twisted mate , she 'll be in a burka and you 'll be an islamic caliphate before you know it . 
  i know you 're hyperbolizing , but i would love to know what makes you think that fundamental muslims will have the majority and/or any political traction in germany . 
  even countries with a vast majority of muslims like oman , kuwait , morocco , tunisia , bosnia ... have liberal societies . 
  why exactly would germany , with a 5.5 % muslim population , be the candidate for an islamic takeover in the foreseeable future ? 
  i mean i 'm not excluding the possibility that you 're seeing something i 'm missing but , like , no millennial germans of turkish origin i know even go to the mosque regularly so it 's really hard for me to be afraid of something like what you 're suggesting happening . 
   what part of deutschland are you from if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  i 'm from frankfurt !, 
  you 're from australia , right ? 
   seriously ? 
  armed border guards is not some weird new idea : they 're there as a deterrent , to enforce the border , to prevent illegal immigration , smuggling , terrorism , etc. , ... all kinds of things . 
  you * just said * that you would n't have anyone shoot immigrants on sight .
