  there 's plenty at the southern border . 
  great for cycling . 
  so ... limburg ? 
  yes , international calls were expensive . 
  but national calls to the mailbox ? 
  that site is horrible on mobile . 
  ca n't remember a time when i ever had to pay to call my mailbox . 
  tomorrow when i can access my hdd i 'll upload a picture of the sea i took from the tower . 
  in the film you can actually jump down . 
  in real life there is a mesh in every opening . 
  and you can see all the way to the sea . 
  you can also watch the giant drum that rings all the different bells . 
  really worth the climb . 
  and sort of the only great thing in that city apart from the pub serving 300 different beers . 
  did you climb the tower ? 
  that was actually quite nice . 
  when you speak real slow it still sounds like you 're clearing your throat . 
  it 's like `` gif '' versus `` jif '' but you guys would say `` chrif '' . 
  just say `` the coast '' . 
  because those are everywhere in the north-east too . 
  question : where is that `` the usa is illegitimate '' coming from ? 
  did you hear it somewhere ? 
  did you read it somewhere ? 
  if so then where ? 
  without context that 's pretty useless here . 
  the rest is pretty weird too . 
  ask them and wait . 
  end of story . 
  they do this for free . 
  you demanding a flair is pathetic . 
  what i find on google tells me it 's actually both . 
  what i find on google tells me it 's actually both . 
  that explains the g. 
  this is done heavily in germany . 
  but it 's 20 + c+m+b +17 this year . 
  20 and 17 should be obvious . 
  c , m and b stand for caspar , melchior and balthazar , the three kings that visited jesus when he was born . 
  the three kings that visited jesus when he was born . 
  little bits of this and little bits of that . 
  then i guess we use the bad tourist trains . 
  are we still talking about the netherlands ? 
  because i ca n't remember a single train i took in hungary that had wifi . 
  the highlight was the czech train to bratislava ... that did n't have wifi . 
  celebrating christmas on the 25th but receiving christmas eve boxes ? 
  so just do n't call them presents before the 25th ? 
  the free in-train wifi is great too . 
  something like every two weeks . 
  shopping in the netherlands on sundays is the main reason . 
  but we live so close to the border of the netherlands and belgium that it just has to happen so often . 
  i passed the spot where it should be recently . 
  i did n't see anything . 
  it was night though . 
  hannover is the city with no dialect . 
  what has always confused you ? 
  that there are german dialects ? 
  and you should look into dutch . 
  they often `` just '' use alternate or old words and phrases sprinkled with a bit of `` let 's say ` chr ' instead of ` g ' '' . 
  the dutch `` please '' for instance is dialected german for `` as you like '' . 
  yes . 
  that 's exactly my point . 
  i went to elementary school until 1994 . 
  in that time we had like 4 weeks of very basic english education . 
  mostly `` count to 10 '' level stuff . 
  for most pupils of that time learning english began with 5th grade . 
  did you read my last sentence ? 
   does n't matter if it makes sense or not . 
  you did n't because you 're explaining again how it does n't make sense . 
  and yet it 's not . 
  one out of four classes at my school started with latin , the other three started with english . 
  of course there is another option . 
  does n't matter if it makes sense or not . 
  yes . 
  `` they chose to be jews and deserve to die for that choice . '', 
  conscription is a thing of the past in germany . 
  also it 's called `` bundeswehr '' because it 's really there to defend the federation 's territory . 
  that 's why it 's not used that often in other countries . 
  if we 're asked to help by the official government because their police wo n't be able to keep the peace then we 'll do it ( i think that 's what happened in the kosovo ) . 
  because it 's got sort of a double meaning to it . 
  `` jedem das seine '' in the end simply means `` to everyone what he chooses '' . 
  we use it as a `` it 's okay if you like pop music or heavy metal '' or `` if you want to be gay then be gay '' . 
  but without judgement . 
  what the nazis made out of it was `` to everyone what he chooses . 
  and if you choose something i do n't like then you 'll be killed for it . '', 
  the channel or the tunnel ? 
  i wanted to add www.immobilienscout24.de , but apparently www.immoscout24.de redirects there . 
  i 've needlessly been typing 6 extra characters all my life !, 
  i remebered seeing a documentary about it years ago . 
  but neither of your two possibilities hinders the point i made so i did n't look into it again . 
  i do n't want to repeat myself , but i think i have to : no , it 's not . 
  i 'm starting to doubt that you know what a club actually is . 
  no , it 's not the same just with different names . 
  so what do a local ** p ** ub and a local ** cl ** ub have in common ? 
  what do you think ? 
  you are still talking about a very different world here . 
  i think `` firemens fest in a neighboring town '' and `` local club '' are things from completely separate worlds . 
  ah , yes . 
  leaving out the answer that makes it perfectly clear that i 'm not serious . 
  it would not . 
  a friend of mine was in warsaw during the winter and apparently they burn everything there to stay warm . 
  i loled .
