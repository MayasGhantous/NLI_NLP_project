  i hope so . 
  going there next summer between vienna and budapest . 
  probably a small village in comparison . 
  are you talking about some village with more cows than people ? 
  because i know of no town or city in the netherlands where there is n't an albert heijn supplying me with vla on a sunday . 
  i totally forgot about how this works in austria : supermarkets can be open on sundays , no problem : http://i.imgur.com/uosvxss.png ( https://www.spar.at/de_at/index/standorte.html ) depends on if the local country leaders/heads ( in german it 's `` landershauptleute '' ) deem the region a tourist region . 
  but from what i 've seen in vienna they ca n't sell certain products . 
  food and drinks ( even alcohol ) can be sold , but do n't dare and try buying shower gel or cremes and all that stuff . 
  in some supermarkets they even made two out of one by erecting fences in the isles so both parts only sell specific groups of products . 
  thus making the `` impossible '' on your map wrong . 
  even if those are tourism areas it means that `` impossible '' is the wrong word . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  i know for a fact that supermarkets on both usedom and r\u00fcgen are open every sunday for half the year . 
  if there are exceptions for a very limited number of sundays then that very limited number is 26 : http://www.svz.de/regionales/mecklenburg-vorpommern/diese-supermaerkte-haben-auch-sonntags-geoeffnet-id14215301.html and it 's not like i made stuff up : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shopping_hours#germany, 
  the one for germany is wrong . 
  there used to be a federal law that forbade supermarkets and shops to be open on sundays . 
  but that has been replaced by state laws in 2006 and is only still active in bavaria and saarland because those never created their own state laws . 
  i was on usedom and r\u00fcgen recently and on both the supermarkets are open on sundays . 
  mostly because there are tourists . 
  the federal law also forbade stores from being open past 8 pm . 
  but again i know plenty of supermarkets that are open until midnight now . 
  tl ; dr : depending on which state you are in shops can be open without a problem or have to be closed on sunday . 
  but `` impossible '' is definitely the wrong word . 
  why would you read the subs at all ? 
  we watch all movies in dutch cinemas and tbh do n't really notice the dutch subs anymore . 
  we 'll remind you about that instantaneous decline right after the uk actually leaves . 
  if it even does . 
  because that is what everybody predicted . 
   in the three months after the referendum on 23 june , the number of firms in significant financial distress fell 6 % to 248,916 from the preceding quarter , according to the insolvency company begbies traynor . 
  the number of distressed companies fell 2 % from a year earlier . 
  so is that `` fell ** by ** 6 % '' , which would n't be all that special , or is it `` fell 6 % from something like 12 % to 6 % '' , which would be astounding . 
  but nobody thought the uk would fall into chaos after that vote . 
  although a lot of idiots voted `` leave '' to `` teach a lesson and make it close '' , i doubt that a lot of business owners are similarly stupid and will wait until the brexit actually happens before they start preparing for it . 
  i 'll end up on / r/shitamericanssay , but why not let the eu negotiator speak american ? 
  problem solved . 
  i 'm not sure there even are less than 16mbit options any more in germany . 
  it 's like buying less mobile data . 
  it just does n't really get cheaper because there is a base fee you ca n't circumvent . 
  for most people i know money is the sole reason they carpool . 
  other reasons would be that you can use carpooling lanes , but to my knowledge these do n't exist in germany . 
  and yet carpooling now has the same effect as carpooling with what op 's link is about . 
  i do n't hear you doing it now though . 
  which has still nothing to do with op 's link . 
  you can always carpool and save money . 
  maybe i 'm misunderstanding what you wrote , but do n't you sort of have a fixed working place at your client 's office ? 
  or is that client changing every day or every few days ? 
  if not then this does n't apply to you . 
  if it does then i find it hard to believe that you and your colleagues could manage any meaningful time frame in which to drive to all 5 clients of that day with a single car . 
  but carpooling does n't lower the travel time for any of the passengers . 
  if any it adds to the time because they have to meet up at a p+r first . 
  okay maybe i need to rephrase my question : why would people ** without a fixed office ** carpool ? 
  and how would they even accomplish that ? 
  does contractor a drop contractor b off at costumer 1 and then drive to costumer 2 ? 
  is contractor b going to have all his tools in his trusty messenger 's bag ? 
  and why exactly would it do that ? 
  misleading title . 
   the ecj ruled that ** workers without a fixed office ** should be able to charge for the time such journeys last, 
  dutch bicycle lanes are either much more full of bicycles ( try crossing the road in amsterdam without getting ringed at ) or they are their own lanes often accommodating 2 people riding their bicycles side by side and with a curb separating that lane from the lanes for the cars . 
  so it 's not really surprising that bicycle lanes wedged between the parking and offloading cars are more dangerous . 
  why ? 
  because they do n't live off of your taxes ? 
  but what about the poles ? 
  is it that you do n't like pole-dancing ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/53yib9/hungarian_ad_in_new_african_magazine/d7xqg2u what does this say ? 
  so i did n't tell myself what i was thinking ? 
  okay . 
  and did you also assume that i do n't like poles ? 
  this clearly shows that you have no clue about what a hypocrite is . 
  it seems that initial comment was made by someone else . 
  i still never wrote anything about not liking poles . 
  and you do n't seem to know what a hypocrite is . 
  and where did i write that i do n't like poles ? 
  because i never did . 
  seems like you are full of shit . 
  why would i be okay with traffickers ? 
  can you read ? 
  and why do you not like poles ? 
  if you want to live in a make-believe world then why not ? 
  fact is that you are okay with traffickers and do n't like muslims . 
  and what does that have to do with the topic of our little `` discussion '' here ? 
  if it was that easy then there would be no traffickers because they would all be in prison . 
  the criminals that traffic girls and sell guns and drugs . 
  that 's sooo much better , right ? 
  why ? 
  i wonder how many people in the netherlands are refugees . 
  less ? 
  there are 45000 or less : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_seekers_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states , _ 2014_and_2015 _ ( thousands_of_first_time_applicants ) _ yb16.png and there 's a population of 17000000 in the netherlands : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands that 's 0.26 % of the population in the netherlands . 
  aboard ship !, 
  every second man in the netherlands is a refugee !, 
  nobody is save anymore !, 
  why ? 
  pastafarian is a mock religion . 
  and why are you writing comments in a removed post ? 
  some of those have really changed . 
  and some just added a few trees and called it a day . 
  was in bratislava recently and it pretty much looks like in the picture just with a bunch of trees added . 
  not really . 
  a guy balancing a plate of spaghetti on his head is simply crazy . 
  just poorly worded for a sarcastic comment . 
  i was thinking about something like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_force,
