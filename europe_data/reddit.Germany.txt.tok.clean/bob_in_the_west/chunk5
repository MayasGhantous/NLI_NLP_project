  in german it 's \u00d6sterreich and australien . 
  hard to mix those up . 
  and bratislava is on the way . 
  worth visiting for a day . 
  i do n't see the point . 
  yes , i thought that you 'd mean that . 
  but how reliable are their sources for baden in germany where this happened ? 
  what region ? 
  baden in germany ? 
  one would imagine that the planers would have thought about that before building a giant solar cooker . 
  interesting . 
  i 'm thinking that this is a building that could need a face lift . 
  could be encased in a mirror facade and would look like any other skyscraper while bringing more light down to the streets . 
  what 's that building for ? 
  til that there are many italians with the surname `` german '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tedesco_ ( surname ) the word comes from latin : https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/theodiscus#latin but i 'm not sure what `` of or pertaining to the language of the people '' actually means . 
  but is n't that the same as with the romance languages ? 
  the region of the saxons used to be closest to the northern countries . 
  i presume that this is from germany not really existing as a country back in the day . 
  while all around german territory big countries had been established , germany itself consisted of a high number of different autonomous countries . 
  and this is why romance languages call it `` allemagne '' or `` alemania '' : https://www.reddit.com/r/french/comments/2dcql8/why_is_germany_called_allemagne_in_french_but/?st=iqm02a8i&amp;sh=317d138c  the romance languages like portuguese , spanish and french seem to have taken the name for germany from the name of a tribe that inhabited a large part of what is now germany . 
  these people were called the alemanni . 
  so allemagne is something like ` land of the alemanni ' just like france gets its name from a germanic tribe , the franks . 
  english took germany from the latin word for the region , germania . 
  so `` kingdom '' is n't an english word ? 
  who knew ? 
  there is no question . 
  not mutilating babies is n't anti-semitic . 
  maaaaybe i 'll let `` anatolia romana '' through as not being english . 
  but what rest is n't in english ? 
  give an example . 
  interesting that the one for germany is in german while the rest is in english . 
  and what is its purpose ? 
  whoever believes in what those `` newspapers '' write should n't be allowed to vote . 
  thank you for the insight . 
  i would have never found that `` employer pays half '' part on the internets . 
  i ca n't afford a house . 
  maybe in 10 years and even then i 'd have to get a loan . 
  that 70 euro per month ticket is for zones 1-5 . 
  if you do n't need that then the ticket is cheaper . 
  but since you are talking about your situation in lisbon : tell us more . 
  how far away is your workplace and how do you get there ? 
  how much do you spend on fuel per month ? 
  of course you can get a car for 700 euros . 
  that 's not hard . 
  what 's the cost for the ( probably ) bi-yearly service and the insurance ? 
  the costs for fuel i already asked about . 
  and the car does n't cost anything ? 
  i pay around 120 euros on fuel alone per month for driving 60km per workday . 
  that 's only fuel . 
  the car costs too . 
  so do the required inspections . 
  and you do n't win cars in lotteries , they normally cost money too . 
  i 'm pretty sure that you will have to at least pay 200 euros per month for a car . 
  a monthly ticket for the metro is 70 euros : http://parisbytrain.com/navigo-pass-prices/ car rentals start at a bit above 100 euros per day . 
  but living in paris itself means not needing a car most of the time . 
  this is more of a `` if you really really need a car and ca n't go by train '' . 
  but even then you 'd have 200 euros per month for a monthly metro ticket and 24 hours with a car . 
  that 's still less expensive than owning a car . 
  why ? 
  it 's probably cheaper to use the metro anyway . 
  and if you need to get outside the city then you can always rent a car . 
  the same you do in other countries . 
  go to one of the cities and check out all the sightseeing stuff . 
  there are also quite a lot of other things to do like visiting one of the hundreds of castles like neuschwanstein , maybe visit one of the many breweries or something ( a lot ) more serious like a concentration camp . 
  if you want more nature then there are a lot of hiking opportunities . 
  the [ bastei bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bastei ) for instance is one of the desktop backgrounds included with windows 7 . 
  ( although it 's just a tiny part of the great malerweg . ), 
  tl ; dr : a country has a lot more to offer than its capital . 
  west germany and east germany are lovely too . 
  have n't been to north germany yet . 
  so are all the other languages . 
  why english ? 
  wo n't be an official eu language soon if they go through with the brexit . 
  i updated my initial post to include the correct languages . 
  do i ? 
  did the dutch suddenly invade belgium ? 
  keep your weird shit to yourself , eh ? 
  we are talking about the language spoken in official eu meeting . 
  pretty hard to miss . 
  but to learn which language ? 
  maybe ~ ~ french ~ ~ walloon or ~ ~ dutch ~ ~ flemish because the eu resides in brussels . 
  or german because germany has the biggest gdp of all european countries ? 
  or how about we change it every three years ? 
  that would be fun !, 
  okay , so imagine being an ordinary greek person and you 're being told that in one of the other eu member states countless people got government jobs to receive money without having to work for it . 
  how would you react to that ? 
  because it 's not solely that other eu member states ' problem . 
  your taxes also paid for these `` jobs '' . 
  yes , this is n't the europe i signed up for either . 
  talking big without any counter arguments . 
  those `` ordinary people '' probably received money for government jobs they never actually did . 
  one should n't throw with stones while sitting in a glass house even if the rich guy down the street decides to move out of the neighborhood . 
  i would n't be surprised if most people who get everything shoved up their asses are most likely to bite the hand that feeds them . 
  are n't there a few islands in it as well ? 
  til . 
  did n't think about that one either . 
  for everyone interested : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silvester, 
  just the german word for new year 's eve . 
  did n't think about that one . 
  i bring my own and i do n't know what you 're talking about .
