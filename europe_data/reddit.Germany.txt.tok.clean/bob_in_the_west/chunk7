  did n't i just saw a photo of a turkish hotel banning dutch and german citizens ? 
  do n't worry , they are already doing the economy thing on their own . 
  edit : yes , i used a saw . 
  would n't you if a country joined the eu ? 
  probably because norway belongs to the shengen area . 
  different countries can have different structures . 
  someone else commented with that english speakers also learn it in school . 
  but i 'm pretty sure that the focus is less on the technical parts of the language and more on things like analyzing stories and poems . 
  of course . 
  but you do a lot more stuff that is n't grammar related . 
  yeah ... no ... not exactly . 
  i had this stuff right until my last year . 
  meanwhile in german i was analyzing poems and stories . 
  which i bet is the same for native english speakers . 
  the difference being that english speakers actually write `` could of '' , but no german would write what you just wrote . 
  as with the english speakers who use `` would of '' : we learn german verbally , so we know when to use each word , just not how to spell it . 
  but i guess that 's the same for every language in the world . 
  well , my single downvote certainly does n't affect it as much as i 'd like . 
   but they are n't common words which makes it kind of okay for me . 
  `` would have '' and `` your/you 're '' are a lot more common . 
  try asking a german when to write `` das '' and when to write `` dass '' . 
  it 's interesting to see how a lot of people fail to explain when to use which . 
  and yes , i do n't understand `` affect '' and `` effect '' either . 
  those two are even pronounced differently . 
  but are n't `` fianc\u00e9 '' and `` fianc\u00e9e '' pronounced the same ? 
  it could of been even worse . 
  it really depends . 
  if you do n't know the english version then you wo n't notice . 
  look at spaceballs . 
  half is better in english , half is better in german . 
  or look at all disney movies ever made . 
  all songs are translated in a lot of different languages and always fit and make sense . 
  truth be told : a lot of germans understand english but are n't as proficient because they do n't really need it ( tv is completely in german for example ) . 
  i like it when a foreigner speaks german to me so i do n't have to find the right words in english . 
  also the `` i 'll speak german and you 'll speak english '' compromise is always great . 
  i also like to correct people on reddit for not knowing the difference between `` your '' and `` you 're '' or `` effect '' and `` affect '' . 
  i had to learn this the hard way . 
  in school . 
  with grades involved . 
  next time write a `` to expand on that : '' in front of your comment . 
  i wrote something . 
  you wrote something . 
  what you wrote is not ** about ** what i wrote . 
  but you make it seem that way because of ** how ** you wrote it . 
  how you wrote your comment makes it sound like what i wrote is said narrative your comment is talking about . 
  which is not the case . 
  replying with `` that 's the narrative ... '' certainly makes it look like that , do n't you think ? 
   it 's not that people are against their ideas , it 's that they voted thinking it 's just a protest . 
  i did n't write that at all . 
  please change your comment so that it reflects that you replied to the wrong comment or actually read what i wrote . 
  yes . 
  i remember the day after brexit . 
   before i thought they were not ` serious ' and this , ladys and gentlemen , is why trump was elected and the afd is as big as it is . 
  if you thought they were n't serious then why even considering voting for them ? 
  because they were serious with the things you agreed with but not with the things you did n't ? 
  well , it 's not like the chancellor is elected by the people . 
  the party with the most seats will do that . 
  and i do hope that people are n't just going to vote because they like schulz 's face more than they like merkel 's . 
  uber is n't a word . 
  german is n't overcomplicated dutch . 
  we just use different words that mean the same thing but are n't used in the same context like in dutch . 
  i 'm going to dutch cinemas to watch movies in ov quite regularly and i 'm not really having a problem with understanding the subtitles without ever having learned dutch . 
  the dutch `` please '' for instance is directly translated `` als du beliebst '' when in german one would say `` wie du beliebst '' . 
  of course nobody in germany would actually say that these days , but it sounds like something people would have said 500 years ago . 
  and it is more complicated than simply saying `` bitte '' . 
  twitter is n't blocked in turkey ? 
  are those 8bn the amount britain is currently giving the eu or is it the amount that is left after what britain receives back is subtracted ? 
  the point here is that they do n't see the bigger picture . 
  they only see that a foreigner is making more money than a local . 
  so we are both agreeing with each other . 
   it 's absolute lunacy , and the pathetic thing is that many brits would love this idea . 
  that is the point here . 
  blue collar workers see that highly skilled immigrants are paid in a month what they make in a year and want them out . 
  but who is employing those people ? 
  apple ? 
  there are plenty more international organisations like those . 
  and they ( hopefully ) pay taxes for the international work they let those immigrants do . 
  and the immigrants pay taxes because they moved to britain . 
  they even push money into the economy because they need food so in the end people want immigrants out that essentially brought their jobs with them . 
  make it unattractive for them to be there and they will go away . 
  but they will also take those jobs to wherever they are going to move . 
  what 's a `` best passport '' ? 
  do they mean `` most powerful '' ? 
  yours has exactly one , but even belgium has three . 
  but which `` dreil\u00e4ndereck '' is it ? 
  ( your flair ), 
  of course i can . 
  but i 'm not giving you personal information on reddit . 
  i 'm not a refugee . 
  and your logic is not logic at all . 
  if the rate is low then it 's easy for everybody including locals and refugees to find a job . 
  that you 're full of shit when you 're talking about `` refugees getting all the jobs '' . 
  i ca n't hear this `` foreigners are taking * our * jobs '' bullshit anymore . 
  if you do n't want to or ca n't do the job then it 's not yours to begin with . 
  seriously ? 
  if those jobs are low level and the unemployed germans do n't want to do them then what 's your point ? 
  and if those jobs need qualified personell and the unemployed germans are n't smart enough to do them then what 's your point ? 
  but that 's how the french see england !, 
  true . 
  looking at the rates the usa are pretty homogeneous .
