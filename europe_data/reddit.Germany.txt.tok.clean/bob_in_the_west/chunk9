  edit : changed `` correct answers '' to `` correct answers to be decided on '' . 
  nobody decides what correct answers are . 
  the test is about facts everyone should know before voting . 
  okay so lets say we let everybody vote about how much led is allowed to be in your drinking water . 
  do you know the maximum levels for led for the drinking water to still be save ? 
  then why should you be able to vote about that ? 
  but you are allowed to read up about it . 
  and once you know how much led can be in drinking water before it becomes toxic then you are allowed to vote . 
  a test about the things the people vote about . 
  you go into the booth , you take the test , if it 's like above 80 % or 90 % correct then you are allowed to vote . 
  letting ill-informed people decide on important things , wcgw ? 
  they do kick you out at 5 . 
  also they do n't have anything good left at 4 . 
  but they miraculously reopen at 6 for the after party and are fully stocked . 
  and then they close again at noon . 
  seems like the rabbids moved to skandinavia . 
  i ca n't really make out the percentages , but i 'm in the light brown area in germany and i have to say that i see redheads astonishingly often . 
  and i 'm not counting looking into the mirror in the morning . 
   `` no no , it 's not ` on those trays ' , it 's ` unos , does , tres ' '' it 's ` ones , two , three ' ? 
  so for polish people the ukranians are what polish are for germans ? 
  i have lived in the western-most city of germany until recently and even there you have your fair share of polish workers . 
  seems like there is a trend to the west in europe . 
  people just do n't want to move to poland , it seems . 
  with a throat clearing in front . 
  you just need to tell a german to clear his throat every time he uses a `` g '' in a word and voila : perfect dutch . 
  because nobody will expect how you pronounce `` groente '' . 
  the capability depends on the type of satellite . 
  you can have one beam that covers the area visible by the satellite . 
  or you can have multiple beams covering only parts each . 
  the latter is called `` spot beam '' and can provide more bandwidth to more people over the same frequencies because the frequencies can be reused per spot . 
  has already been asked there , it seems . 
  op of that post has not answered any questions so far . 
  why is germany the only one labelled in german and the rest in english ? 
  we had a nice 28 here today . 
  did n't even need the ceiling fan . 
  is that a direct reply to my comment or to the article ? 
  so they are going back to a being the most efficient and probably will confuse costumer who will either buy older a + + + products they think are more efficient or even buy super old a products because `` a is the most efficient , right ? '', 
  microsoft had this number to represent the power of the computer that could only grow as hardware got better . 
  that should be used instead . 
  but did you have to activate data roaming in your phone 's options ? 
  my provider ( alditalk in germany ) sent me an sms stating `` you do n't have to do anything '' , but i 'm wondering if that means that i just do n't have to buy their eu package anymore . 
  the difference is probably the humidity . 
  we recently had a very dry 30 \u00b0 c day here in west germany and did n't even need a ventilator . 
  but the past week ( today included ) i 've been sweaty the whole time . 
  even a difference of 0.1 % can mean a lot in absolute numbers . 
  and that 's where you 're wrong . 
  both times i might add . 
  why ? 
  you 're the one who started with the unwarranted insults . 
  i 'm simply here to ensure that you get it right for once . 
  that 's still wrong . 
  it 's a terror attack in the uk . 
  no it 's not . 
  i just had that conversation over `` polish camps '' when those obviously had to be `` german camps in poland '' . 
  a british terror attack is a terror attack executed by brits or maybe executed in a british style . 
  and it 's not even something that occurs in the uk . 
  northern ireland is n't in britain but part of the uk . 
  seems like you need some fresh air , hm ? 
  and again : the whole of europe . 
  why does that need to fit your specific terror attack ? 
  the title is n't even worded to specifically mean britain . 
  also what is a * british * terror attack ? 
  idiots like you not getting that this is n't / r/unitedkingdom but / r/europe is the reason why i come here for laughs . 
  that 's pretty obviously not the case . 
   everyone, 
  i did the same thing . 
  i explicitly stated the context : `` an american saying [ ... ] '' . 
  let 's repeat the last analogy : an american saying `` those are ** our ** german airbases '' and `` those are german airbases '' is not the same thing . 
  do you agree ? 
  it still should have said `` lager in polen '' . 
  does n't matter if it 's a german textbook used in german schools . 
  also how do you know that everyone knows what happened in ww2 and who 's at fault ? 
  you do n't . 
  you think it to be the case because you have n't met someone who does n't know about it . 
  but how many people have you met so far ? 
  all 7 billion ? 
  all in your country ? 
  all in your state ? 
  in your city ? 
  i do n't even know all my neighbors . 
  you could also say that everybody knows the basic laws of physics . 
  but there are plenty of people who do n't and have a totally skewed view on the whole subject . 
  yes , the context is important . 
  they said '' ** our ** german airbases '' . 
  so it 's a part of the whole '' ** our ** airbases '' . 
  that context is missing in op 's picture . 
  does that make my point any less valid ? 
  if there was no poland at the time then `` polish camp '' is incorrect and `` german camp in poland '' is incorrect too . 
  the only right way in that case is `` german camp in germany '' and that is even further away from `` polish camp '' . 
  it 's clear to you , but not to someone who does n't already know about it . 
  it 's not even sort of true . 
  you are mixing `` polish '' with `` in poland '' . 
  if you went to poland , would you be polish ? 
  or would you still be finnish while in poland ? 
  you 're still wrong in assuming that `` polish camp '' is right . 
  what you are thinking about is `` camp in poland '' which means something very different . 
  that guys like you live in the same state as i do is truly unsettling for me . 
  it should have been `` lager in polen '' and not `` polnische lager '' . 
  because `` in polen '' is a geographic term . 
  `` polnisch '' means they were run and owned by poles and that simply is n't the case .
