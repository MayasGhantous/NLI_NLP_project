  right after i swore my oath as a soldier and drove home the first time in uniform , a man approached me in the train . 
  he asked me some dubious questions , if i approaved of our constitution and stuff . 
  he then proceeded to introduce himself as a worker at the reichsfinanzministerium and showed me some of his paperwork he had on him . 
  just a few days prior i watched a documentary about these guys and i could n't believe someone would actually be that stupid . 
  and then i got proven wrong , it was very irritating . 
  the hre under austrian rule ? 
  happy cake day btw, 
  of those i heard , but they are more a continuation of the political movement between 1918 and 1938 , rather then real crazy people as the reichb\u00fcrger are . 
  or do austrians regard them the same ? 
  do they claim to live in austria-hungary or what ? 
  distrust ? 
  against the former warsaw pact states i guess , at least against some . 
  neither poland , czechia nor hungary are very well liked , at least as political entities these days . 
  but against the people ? 
  not so much . 
  i think western europe would stay stable . 
  eastern europe is another thing . 
  could go both ways . 
  but there we have much more nationalism , one far more agressive power ( russia ) and less time of friendship as the west has experienced it . 
  just look at france and germany . 
  why should we fight again ? 
  we tried that approach and it failed . 
  it actually brought misery tohuge parts of europe . 
  but if hungary and romania e.g. 
  duke it out , who would really care ? 
  there is still a iron curtain in europe even though it got softer . 
  d\u00f6ner , haxe and bratwurst i 'd say . 
  even though d\u00f6ner is the most common thing to eat . 
  chinese people do barely integrate at all . 
  they even walk through western cities and call the natives foreigners . 
  strange people these chinese . 
  turks well integrated ? 
  i would say a huge chunk , most likely the majority is but there are more then enough turks who are n't integrated a bit and not very well regarded . 
  low education , wanky german after being the second and sometimes third generation in germany and very rude , lately being erdogan supporters who did take their anti g\u00fclen campaign to the streets of germany . 
  best integrated : eastern europeans as a whole . 
  does n't matter if they are polish , russian , czech or from any other country in the baltic or the balkans , even though neither albanians , macedonians and kosovarians are that well perceived . 
  actually besides the car theft thing poland is usually not that much looked down upon . 
  even though we have the phrase '' [ ... ] dann ist polen offen '' , which most times means if someone does something specific the reaction will be harsh . 
  if you can afford that you unlocked the `` never need to worry about money again '' achievement . 
  well , every time germany made to many divisions it became west , middle , east and south europe . 
  have n't had one in years ( always thought they are disgusting ) so i might not be up to date . 
  i just remember the time they were relabeled and it was just `` mann , ist der dick , man - dickmann 's '' . 
  but since you can be their best friend while i think about having sex with them , does n't that exlude me from being a true best friend and therefore being heterosexual would be the real sexist thing ? 
  germany had the same ` negerkuss ' even though neger means negro , not nigger . 
  today it 's called either dickmanns ( after the producer ) or eierschaumspeise . 
  because we tend to overthink everything until it 's racist . 
  believe me , i know what i am speaking of since there was a commity , that acutally wanted a memorial for homosexual men killed in the third reich remade so it covers women * who never have been targeted by the nazis for being gay * . 
  if you think hard enough everything is racist or sexist . 
  for me it 's either a 2/10 or a 8/10 . 
  ask me anything beyond ` germany is nazicountry ' stuff and i am glad do answer . 
  visited norway once , found a german bunker . 
  solid 5/7 , would visit again . 
  i 'd really visit again your nature is amazing . 
  we europeans have to remember that there is another america , one that voted obama into office who wanted to regulate guns more , the ones that are educated , the ones that can be polite and do not push the ` murica furst agenda . 
  i hope that some day that america becomes the face of the us again ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ canada ^ ^ ^ invades ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ becomes ^ ^ ^ king ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ north, 
  it 's kinda the same with hungarians . 
  a big part of their history was ` swallowed ' by austria and today they are just one country of the old eastern block . 
  i think that 's the reason why many ` younger ' countries are actually so patriotic , because they feel like they have to catch up . 
  ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ the ^ ^ reason ^ ^ why ^ ^ austrians ^ ^ are ^ ^ triggered ^ ^ when ^ ^ being ^ ^ called ^ ^ germans, 
  that 's kinda nice . 
  most times someone talks about the war ( s ) i have to say `` very likely one of my relatives was there and shot at your countrymen '' . 
  would you mind sharing it ? 
  well i would n't say ww1 was the real tragedy . 
  it was bad but how it ended made all the difference . 
  there was failure from so many parties involved , in hindsight it hurts . 
   insisting czechs are all in fact somehow involved in pornography are you telling me the documentaries i saw on the internet are n't real ? 
  i really think that everyone would 've been better of if instead rebuilding berlin after the war we had just build a huge park area for recreation . 
  it depends . 
  are they hardliners , extremists ? 
  no way we will be friends . 
  do they hold another view than mine . 
  well , we can discuss it , but in the end agree to disagree . 
  flair checks out, 
  and mayonnaise, 
  is n't vienna full of buildings with the habsburger coat of arms ? 
  do you have a recent example ? 
  never saw a two headed eagle in modern germany , in the past there were some noble families who had one iirc , but germany as a state either had the prussian eagle ( one head ) or the reichsadler or the most recent bundesadler . 
  edit : the double headed eagle would be the symbol of the imperium romanum sanctum and austria-hungary . 
  but the former stoped existing 1806 , so we germans do n't use it anymore . 
  i think you can see the austrian eagle still prominent in cities like vienna , but that should be confirmed by an austrian , since i am only speculating . 
  i guess we had to learn to stick together . 
  having the french as an ally really proves it worth , especially if russia some day decides that we should cut poland ... 
  i mean the cake together to become friends once again . 
  i actually like our eagle . 
  it represents our country like no other animal , if you see its depiction in the reichstag you 'll see a fat creature that would be unable to kill anything in the wild . 
  good representation of germany !, 
  i 'd like to add that many people think we 're rude because we 're rather direct and ( in the north ) dislike being talked to by strangers as if we were best buds . 
  * staring intensifies *, 
  you might be right . 
  calais was english before france decided that the english should fuck off the continent and dwell on their island made of bad weather and fish and chips . 
  thing is , there is n't just one america in the minds of people . 
  it 's a country of science and at the same of creationists , the country of liberal values mashed together with regressive nationalists , the country of nice people who ca n't drink more than a few beers vs the rednecks who ca n't stop drinking , a superpower that wants a foot in every door , but the same time wants to isolate itself etc. 
  basicly there are amercians and there are muricans . 
  i do like the former and despise the latter . 
  `` german '' - your dialect is closer to bayrisch then to german and the only way to understand that is if they speak hochdeutsch . 
  but i think nobody claims him or do dutch and belgians actually disagree on that ? 
  well , it 's all fun and games until it 's anschluss time !, 
  back then , yes , i agree . 
  but some of them somehow stayed on or at least near that level and that to a far bigger degree than our european religious people . 
  i think our ` christian ' conservative party ( cdu ) has muslims runing for office .
