  but compairing the us and europe in that regard is a bit unfair . 
  the us was ( partialy ) founded by our religious nutjobs , no offense . 
  as i wrote in the title i am a former officer of the german armed forces ( bundeswehr ) who retired last year after 6 years of service due to medical reasons . 
  i will answer questions regarding my time in the army , studing and living in germany . 
  tell me more about these ss-steel helmets that lie around in every baracks . 
  please , you seem very , very informed . 
  because in my 6 years in the forces i saw 2 ( ! ), 
  without any coat of arms . 
  what i saw more often were old weapons as the luger or the k98 ( k ) . 
  sometimes memorials of specific regiments . 
  but ss stuff ? 
  not even once . 
  not if the axis simply sealed of the mountain regions and bombed switzerland from time to time . 
  no need to invade , there is barely enough food to sustain the whole populous without any imports . 
  nah , that 's no problem . 
  but never stand next to a window in prague that has a pile of filth below while a german stands next to you . 
  that might end in an unpleasent experiance if you are a catholic . 
  for real ? 
  ok , it seems the balkans are still doing balkan things . 
  shame . 
  i bet finns would like to have a word with you . 
  yes , but after 20 years there are some new generations to pick up a new approach to that mess , or at least i hope so . 
  just look at the situation 1940 . 
  germany swept through poland with ease , the u.k. and france proceeded to sit behind the maginot line . 
  the soviet union and germany were partners , the usa was n't seen anywhere . 
  and now think about swedens perspective . 
  yes , they might lose their freedom in the long way if germany wins . 
  but if it does n't , then sweden will remain free . 
  no , it is pretty simple . 
  neither sweden nor switzerland would 've gained anything by going to war with germany . 
  sweden would 've been defeated within days and switzerland would 've been starved to death . 
  so i do n't think you can blame them for remaining neutral . 
  thing is the problems of the balkans and former yugoslavia seem to be mostly a hint of the past while brexit and trump are creating new , uncalled problems and divisions . 
  so while your region is good to go into a better future we westerners have a problem with people who want to go in the exact opposite direction . 
  what should they have done differently ? 
  fighting germany and getting smashed as well ? 
  nice that you are here , even though i hate you being here . 
  as a dutch he should feel comfy as long as there is some swap around . 
  ` peace , peace , peace for everyone ' ... really ? 
  videos like this make me call for a gerxit . 
  as a ** partner , friend and ally ** the us was , is and will always be welcome to europe . 
  as a power that wants directly influence us through political force , no thank you . 
  europe has suffered from internal powerplay on that level long enough and we 're finally starting to head in a better direction , at least for parts of europe . 
  him and his team meddling with the russian during the election is what makes the relations so bad in the first place . 
  but these new sanctions are dumb because they now do as well drive a wedge between europe and the us - again . 
  they are clearly designed to hurt russia and grant the us controll or at least a bigger foothold on the european energy market . 
  and here i as a european have to say : fuck off , america . 
  if you elect presidents like trump i do n't want you sitting in our backyard , we have our own neighbours with autocratic tendencies . 
  well , here you are , talking about said banner : ^ ), 
  you may be close geographically , but you brits always were outside of the europe in your hearts . 
  go rule the waves , we 'll take australia into europe , they at least have cool animals ( go away you can welsh scum ! ), 
  we shall reclaim it , deus vult !, 
   sigismund iii ** vasa ** has there ever been a more swedish king ? 
  i thought it would be vodka ... / s, 
  be careful with the word anschluss . 
  if you say 3 times in front of a mirror ad midnight austria disappears . 
  you could put petain on your posters . 
  he actually would be a good poster boy since he combines the good and the tragic side of your nation ( to a certain extend ) . 
   eendracht maakt macht sounds like a drunk german . 
  i like it . 
  we do realize you exist , but why would we invade belgium to get some french fries ? 
  that are people being tricked by the name . 
  they actually wanted to visit greenland to see some eskimos . 
  you forgot to add `` belgian soldiers as well crossed the border , they joined the occupation forces even though the only thing they brought was beer '' . 
  mkay , i am getting the dicke berta , time for some aiming practice on those dykes . 
  well then you would be an island of the northern border of europe and would nlexit . 
  that would be hillarious . 
  on the other hand our supply of vla and hagelslag would dry out . 
  give me a second , i 'll get my shovel and some bags , we need higer dykes !, 
  shhh , it will be over soon . 
  carefull what you say or else i 'll invest in coal energy so global warming gives us a new coastline at cologne . 
  dude , as someone who has served 6 years in the bundeswehr himself : it is shit . 
  not because its soldiers suck or are worse then other armed forces . 
  it 's a mixture of bad policy , corruption , the constant reforms , the hostile enviroment you face back home and and and . 
  you should n't feel personally attacked ( i did feel the same in the past ) , you should see it as criticism towards what was made out of the bw . 
  below 180.000 soldiers and well funded is relative . 
  germany left its armed forces out in the rain to rot for nearly 3 decades now . 
  equipment is breaking down , motivation is low , the general populus is at best on a neutral stance towards the bundeswehr and it suffers from 3 decades of reform that were only half done and droped as soon as the government changed . 
  people like to talk shit about the bundeswehr , but it is the military in one of the worst positions in the western world . 
  simply allowing negotiations would 've done the job . 
  yes , germany lost but the treatment it received was way too arrogant for powers who claimed to end imperialism but somehow managed to expand their colonial empires through the war . 
  but this peace combined with a weak constitution , a state without a loyal army or even local officials torn between revanchists and communists was n't meant to last . 
  well , it was harsh towards germany , the power affected the most by the treaty , that was n't even allowed to negotiate . 
  the treaty in the way it was did so much damage to the new republic that some sort of catastrophe was unavoidable . 
  not necessarily the nazi scale of shit , but still a huge pile of it . 
  forgot to add the / s i guess . 
  how come that france let 's itself be limited by a constitution ? 
  you had more republics than the average redneck has shorts . 
  yes so a centralized state , not states in general , that does nothing to maintain dialects ( that change and disappear all the time ) is at high risk to lose certain dialects . 
  this is specific and does neither support your claim of states in general doing harm to dialects nor the idea that some sort of militarization has any influence on that matter . 
  france is the worst example for being a centralized state that does n't uphold the agreement to protect dialects , that many european countries signed . 
  germany e.g. 
  still has groups of people who speak the prussian dialects of today 's polish territories . 
  they are less common , but that was to be expected . 
  that would be one of the dumbest equations i 've seen in a while . 
  countries with national schools do preserve languages . 
  britain is like a turd to europe . 
  it somewhat is a part of you but once it leaves it 's kinda disgusting and stinks . 
  could n't agree more . 
  i think the phrase `` never again '' is the ultimate justification to let hell loose to stop atrocities like those that happened .
