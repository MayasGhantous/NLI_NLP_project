  but we do n't build those anymore , so what is it in photovoltaics ? 
  about 1000 km ^ 2 + storage ( 10 ^ 3 km ^ 2 would be 2x the world pv production capacity ) . 
  or up to 10000 large ( off-shore ) wind turbines a year . 
  again , plus storage . 
  these numbers can be reduced by combining the technologies , but not by orders of magnitude . 
  ( the numbers for renewables appear larger because one has to compensate for weather effects by building more capacity . 
  pv in germany , for example , only produces electricity for ~ 32 days straight every year . ), 
  as you can imagine , we are not building up to 1000 km ^ 2 of pv every year , nor 10000 wind turbines . 
  of course , we can hope for significant power savings and increases in efficiency ... but they would have to be * substantial * . 
  and the rest of the world must not try the same , because we might not be able to satisfy everyone . 
  i 'm long-term betting europe , * including * germany , will , in fact , be building new nuclear power plants in the year 2050 . 
  there are many bugs in europe that can threaten the ecosystem . 
  the only reason they do n't is because winter kills them in time . 
  until now , at least . 
  global warming might change that , possibly changing vegetation drastically . 
  they want to combine some of these positions into one and make him elected by parliament . 
  so it 'd save money and be more democratic than it is now ... did you even bother reading the article ? 
  right is north , you can see london and the channel . 
  paris is at the centre between the two `` wings '' of the station . 
  the lord mayor of the city of london and the mayor of london are two very different things , just fyi . 
  i 'm sure germany is happy to have a pretence to subsidise its ailing shipyards ... 
  germany agreed to compensate israel after the attacks , we ca n't just walk away from the contracts . 
  the submarines give israel a second-strike capability should their bases in israel proper be destroyed . 
  germany subsidises the submarines since iraq attacked israel in the gulf war with scuds that were upgraded with german technology . 
  do we really want our union to border the resource rich regions around the caspian sea and extend its liberal-democratic influence directly into the important area between russia , india and china ( which is inhabited by , exactly , turkic people , like those in turkey ) ? 
   wholly german empire :-), 
  sorry , i got mixed up with another discussion . 
  it should say something like `` same nationality '' . 
  judging individuals based on the actions of people who look similar to them is not proper and fair judgement . 
  it 's appropriate to call it what it is . 
  racism is a word that has evolved beyond its original meaning . 
  that said , it 's rather weird to think that having the second largest national group in the ep would give you much power . 
  these meps are divided among political factions , it 's not like they would dominate . 
  the reason why germany is currently so powerful is because its size allowed it to become very rich in absolute terms and , in intergovernmental systems , the powerful ones tend to make the rules . 
  the schengen agreement was incorporated into eu law : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:12008m/pro/19:en:html i should have been more precise , `` some eu regulations '' . 
  a federal government is not a centralised government . 
  it 's pretty much the opposite . 
  power remains divided and problems are handled at the appropriate level . 
  so you would not * add * bureacracy , you 'd transfer it from one layer to another one where we 'd get more out of it . 
  for instance , the combined military budget of the eu is * about * 1/3 -1 / 2 of america 's . 
  i 'm not judging that fact , i 'm just pointing out that we get way less than 1/2 of what america gets out of its expenditure . 
  they have about a dozen super-carriers with fleets patrolling the world , bases scattered over every continent , and fantastic research programmes that have lots of civilian by-products like self-driving cars or better prosthetics . 
  obviously we europeans do n't get 1/2 of that for our expenditures , do we ? 
  well , i think we could if we got our shit together . 
   you do n't need a continental quasi-socialism just to have a common market and free migration . 
  we could have those without that . 
  quasi-socialism ? 
  what ? 
  please leave that to the republicans , will you ? 
  who is supposed to make the rules that govern the free trade and travel area ? 
  yes , and they have to implement eu regulations for that reason . 
  that 's why there would be second chamber to give smaller states a louder voice . 
  laws would need to get both a majority of the states and of the population . 
  that said , being sovereign next to a giant is an illusion . 
  ask the norwegians or the swiss how they like their sovereignty every time they get to implement the latest eu regulation . 
  av would n't have been that much of an improvement anyway , no ? 
  is there any chance [ mmp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mixed-member_proportional_representation ) might spread in the uk ? 
  maybe like in [ new zealand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_system_of_new_zealand ) ? 
  edit : apparently it 's already in use in some parts : [ ams ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/additional_member_system ), 
  my humble opinion : no . 
  you inherit the country , you inherit its debts and responsibilities that come with it . 
  even if individuals did not profit from taking on certain debts , the nation as a whole did ( wealth flowed into it ) . 
  the debtor nation is free to deal with its corrupt elite however it wants , for example taking the embezzled monies back . 
  but the creditors ca n't be obliged to deal with them themselves if they lent money to the whole nation . 
  usually not , but this time he appears to be very nervous . 
  fair enough . 
  if you want to push for equality you do n't count as a righty according to the aforementioned definition . 
  if we follow [ this definition of right-wing politics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right-wing_politics ) ,  in politics , the right , right-wing and rightist has been defined as the support or acceptance of social hierarchy . 
  inequality is viewed by the right as inevitable , natural , normal , or desirable , whether it arises though traditional social differences , or from competition in market economies . 
  then yes , there is something inherently bad about it . 
  that 's because [ inequality is harmful to society ] ( http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html ) as a whole . 
  the thing about physics is that in many areas there are no more breakthroughs to be expected without substantial funding . 
  no matter how much we 'd like to go smaller , something like iter will -- as a first of its kind -- never be cheaper than a few billions . 
  it does n't appear smart to me to abandon a discipline only because of its inherent grandeur . 
  we do n't have to choose between the two extremes , though . 
  there are funding bodies , but they also reserve funding for large projects with doubtful results . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  far from it . 
  you ca n't make a substantiated cost-benefit analysis if you ca n't foresee the benefits . 
  that 's exactly the case with ( not only ) large physics projects . 
  if we always disregard these potential benefits we 'll never invest in any longshots . 
  that our science budgets are too small is a reason to increase them , not pit one discipline against the other . 
  especially since we never know what we might find when we fund something that does not promise any concrete results . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  his claim of an israeli nuclear first strike wiping out iran is just nonsense . 
  edit : seriously , downvotes ? 
  israeli nukes on submarines are there to give the ability to retaliate even if continental bases are destroyed . 
  really , military strategy 101 . 
  http://maxwellsci.com/print/crjss/v2-255-261.pdf conclusion given the prerequisites and limitations of the model , it allows the following conclusions : * democratic elections result in merely mediocre political leaders . 
  * the improvements that can be achieved by subsequent election steps are limited . 
  * the main advantage of democratic elections is that they effectively prevent lower-than-average candidates from becoming leaders . 
  * substantial and lasting improvements in leadership can be achieved only by improving the average cq of the entire compound . 
  * democratic rules , such as the freedom of the press , have to guarantee that ruling leaders are not allowed to hinder the growth of average capabilities . 
  that 's actually a reason for federation , is n't it : corrupt state officials in america are dealt with by federal law enforcement . 
  here we can just ask greece nicely to do something about it . 
   also , what 's with prop8 and the minaret law always coming up when direct democracy is discussed ? 
  it 's not like one ca n't find more examples of failure for representative democracy or any other form of governance . 
  because especially switzerland is always brought up as a paradise where direct democracy works . 
  so bringing up some pretty bad decisions that have not been made in representative democracies is a nice way to show that dd is n't all sunshine .
