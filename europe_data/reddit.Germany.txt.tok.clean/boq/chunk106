  the commission president is usually someone related to the largest group in the ep . 
  for the next european elections , some of the individual parties have announced that they will nominate their candidates for commission president so we can kind of vote for the commission . 
  though technically , it will still be the council that nominates him or her . 
  i refuse to believe someone was stupid enough to sign this off . 
  it must be a draft that was n't supposed to be published . 
  they are . 
  but the government sits idly by instead of using its own freedom of speech to counter these vicious attacks . 
  it 's not every single thing , it 's something done by the party supporting the minority government . 
  it 's 22 +34 = 56 % in favour , 14 +12 = 26 % against , 16 % undecided . 
  that 's more than a 2:1 super-majority . 
  we recently had a census ... http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/q72s9/reurope_10000_subscribers_milestone_census_the/ here 's the result about a european superstate : http://i.imgur.com/utkr6.png, 
  good for him . 
  in 2011 , the 17.3 gw of installed photovoltaics produced 11.7 twh of electrical energy . 
  they were only operational for about * 1 month of the year * [ [ 1 ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/solarstrom#bruttostromerzeugung_aus_solarenergie_in_deutschland ) ] . 
  the only way to offset this inefficiency is by sending the rest of us the bill , i.e. 
  through the eeg . 
  i 'd love to get in on that action , but i live in an apartment and have no roof to put them on . 
  no one subsidizes me or my neighbours for living in a high density urban area where i save heat by having other apartments directly adjacent to mine , even though my total power consumption is most likely lower than your dad 's . 
  there have been two ines 7 accidents , i.e. 
  `` supergaus '' . 
  the other ones are quite irrelevant as they did not lead to widespread contamination beyond the plant 's compound . 
  to an outside observer , they were not any different from other industrial accidents . 
  as for your last question . 
  for two reasons . 
  the world 's current challenge is n't how to deal with nuclear * anything * . 
  it 's climate change . 
  nuclear power can produce huge amounts of power without any noteworthy emission , if done correctly . 
  seeing as the bulk of the consequences of global warming will hit developing nations and not those responsible for them -- once again -- i can not with good conscience go down any path that will increase emissions . 
  for the time being , that means coal and other fossil plants should have to be shut down before we abandon nuclear power . 
  the cost . 
  not only are renewable plants themselves incredibly expensive , they also require huge investments in related infrastructure . 
  investments that could instead go into education , health , research , development aid and whatnot . 
  instead we subsidies already well-off home owners so they can get inefficient photovoltaics on their roofs . 
  sorry , not interested in videos . 
  unreliable . 
  i 'll read if you have something worthwhile . 
  that said , the point stands . 
  nuclear plants are insured . 
  beyond the insurance sum the company is liable with its assets . 
  for a company like e.on , that 's somewhere in the range of at least eur 30bn , judging from e.on 's market capitalisation . 
  either way , that 's a useless discussion as there is absolutely no reason to assume one of our plants will suffer such an accident . 
  there have so far only been two of that kind , one was caused by improper operation of an already defective reactor design , the other one by a horrible natural disaster that killed around 20,000 people -- and as of now still not even one through radiation . 
  nuclear plants are [ insured up to eur 2.5 bn ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/atdeckv_1977/bjnr002200977.html ) . 
  apparently you are not as knowledgeable as you thought . 
  who 'd have thunk . 
   anyone who does n't share my opinion is brain-washed . 
  we are pooling sovereignty in areas where the nation state is close to or already unable to get things done . 
  different interests are actually a reason in favour of democratic organisation , are n't they . 
  the only way to balance out different interests in a civilised way . 
  else the big ones just bully the small ones . 
  yeah . 
  living in germany the thought of adding another layer of federation on top really is n't frightening . 
  i already have so many layers of government , local council , regional government , state government , federal government , what 's a continental government on top of that ? 
  is there someone very nice here who would compile a list of torrents for all the movies in this thread ? 
  pretty please . 
  why are you doubting this ? 
  a pdf behind a shortened url . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  my life became sadder when i realised that tabloids exist because there are people who like to read what they write , not the other way around . 
  not just that , when france joined the eec , most of its territory was in africa ( algeria ) . 
  is n't that what the troika is doing through internal devaluation ? 
  making the price reductions through real cuts instead of currency devaluation ? 
  at this point i 'd speak german with them back home in romania , too :-) but yeah , some information is probably missing . 
  i speak german at home with my romanian parents . 
  yep . 
  edit : well , actually it says country of origin . 
  unless you were born on a border , i think that 's pretty clear . 
  citizenship is n't the subject of the question ( s ) . 
  good . 
  do n't get infected by our radiophobia . 
  yes , i meant the pause . 
  you can hear it in the background very faintly ... not enough to make it out . 
  not without some sort of sound enhancement ;-), 
  i was hoping for what ukip said in the op 's video . 
  im pro eu but  i 'm in favour of this ruling so the eu is great is a poor argument . 
  what did ukip say ? 
  i could n't find a second source . 
  is that verified ? 
  romance language ? 
  or those who can read the original can click `` original '' on the google translate page ? 
  nu-uh , the real number is on the sidebar !, 
  we are the 10,000 / 731m = 0.00137 % !, 
  as external devaluation is not possible while in the ez : internal devaluation . 
  i submitted it to [ / r/bestof ] ( / r/bestof ) because i was that impressed : http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/po4z3/redditor_explains_why_greece_europe_are_stuck/, 
  did you read the article ? 
  it says `` not yet ( if ever ) '' . 
  does esa even have any spacecraft able to send someone to the moon ? 
  apology accepted . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; i have that lower-case b for a reason , because it makes the name point symmetric . 
  that clock tower looks absolutely dystopian to me , i do n't know why . 
  cartoonishly evil . 
  and replace it with what ? 
  well , do you speak greek and read greek media ? 
  i do n't , but i 'm assuming they are just as diverse as we are and so they probably do debate that . 
  it 's natural for greeks here to become a little defensive when they see all finger pointed at them . 
   eu is run for the benefit of the banks , not the people , yes , obviously , because a widespread banking crash will not affect the people in * any * way , right ? 
  here 's the problem , food is language-agnostic . 
  comedy is n't . 
  aside from a lot of anglophone comedians i like a few german ones , for example [ dieter nuhr ] ( http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=dieter+nuhr#q=dieter+nuhr&amp;hl=de&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvnso&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=vid&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=wzo2t9eqgy3esgal-tceda&amp;ved=0ckubekse&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.cf.osb&amp;fp=d076eaae789ed56d&amp;biw=1156&amp;bih=1025 ) . 
  and now ?
