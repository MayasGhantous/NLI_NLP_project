  i mean , they could have made it and still laid claim to the land of israel but no , they did n't . 
  * germany , as a country , is the successor state of the third reich . 
  thus , modern germany as a collective is still responsible , even if individuals who were born much later on are not . 
  whining wo n't change that . 
  you inherit a house , you pay the mortgage . 
  * it 's an unfounded accusation against a large part of an ethnic/religious group that fuels resentment against said group . 
  it would count as discrimination when applied to other groups . 
  * what israel does is * not at all * what the nazis did . 
  either the respondents do n't know what they were talking about and simply made a mistake or they do know it and just apply a double standard . 
  a double standard that discriminates against israel , the * jewish * state . 
  thus , ** latent ** anti-semitism . 
  not `` hunting-down-jews '' - anti-semitism , just latent one . 
  or , in all three cases , simply ignorance or stupidity ( that might still manifest itself as anti-semitism ) . 
  i guess you ca n't really discriminate between those two possiblities . 
  unless you evaluate more questions and try to find a coherent picture in some way . 
  have n't read the study , maybe they address that in more detail . 
  it 's not the same * at all * . 
  a democratic and tolerant state that protects * its * minorities while being in a state of war with not just one neighbouring country defending itself is not the same as the attempted industrial destruction of entire peoples . 
  not even if you count the crazy settlers who are able to take israel 's government hostage in some regards . 
  you may not be an anti-semite , but you certainly do n't really know what you are talking about . 
  you ca n't be underqualified to give someone a chunk of your land . 
  belgium does n't run the eu . 
  yes . 
  therefore , only buy danish tvs . 
  in fact , that would take out money of your personal economy . 
  therefore , buy only tvs you built yourself , from the ground up . 
  they earned their money by * working * in `` your '' economy and apparently adding value to it ( else they would n't have been hired ) . 
  they paid their taxes to `` your '' coffers . 
  `` you '' got everything `` you '' deserved , the rest belongs to them . 
  i 'm sure you wo n't , however , mind when someone in `` their '' economy buys something from `` your '' economy , taking money out of `` theirs '' and sending it to `` yours '' , eh ? 
  tl ; dr : the economy , both in europe and the world is not a zero-sum game . 
   leech like judgemental much ? 
  the eu is in the process of capping data prices as well . 
  see [ here ] ( http://christianengstrom.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/data-roaming-dear-former-state-monopolies/ ) for example for some information . 
  jill who , what party ? 
  people do n't run around and scream it from the rooftops . 
  talk to them about this topic , things might change . 
  though that rarely happens , at least where i am . 
  this map is `` per inhabitant '' , so population density dependence has been removed . 
  there is another map in [ / r/mapporn ] ( / r/mapporn ) that is purchasing power per area : http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/orgkm/theres_this_as_well_purchasing_power_density_in/, 
   not in germany ( you should know that ) . 
  thank you , i did not know that . 
   the ruk will be denoted as the successor state and will inherit all the treaty obligations of the uk . 
  will it ? 
  that would mean scotland also would n't take its share of the national debt and so on . 
  i 've made short animation together with previous year 's data : [ gif ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mkqvh.gif ) i would have made a differential picture but i was n't quite sure how to make a meaningful difference image in photoshop : - /, 
  your assumptions are wrong . 
  the system does n't need regular self-tests the same way air bags do n't . 
  besides , testing whether there is a persistent connection or not and making it public is a trivial task . 
  equally , the standard version of the system wo n't need a sim card , just as phones do n't need a sim card for emergency calls . 
  that changes only if you want more services in your car . 
  i do n't deny that there are forces in government pushing in that direction . 
  but the public is neither that weak nor is government that powerful that we would need to put on such a defeatist attitude . 
  using eurosceptics as political pawns ? 
  now that 's some realpolitik i can get behind !, 
  from your name i assume you are in the uk . 
  you could try contacting [ your local pirate party ] ( http://www.pirateparty.org.uk/ ) , i guess they can either organise something or know others who can . 
  thank you . 
  the german page also says that the system only starts up after a crash , for privacy reasons . 
  as long as that is * guaranteed * , i can live with it . 
  can you give a link to the second claim . 
  that sounds ... `` interesting '' . 
  but ( un ) fortunately i could n't anything . 
  regarding your first claim , that 's a little stretch . 
  according to a number of polls , the irish rejected lisbon for things that were n't in the treaty . 
  after they were re-assured `` yes , we really wo n't touch your tax rate or force you to abort all your babies '' , they voted again and * overwhelmingly * ( like almost 2:1 ) agreed to it . 
  the last two ones are true , however :-( unfortunately i still believe it 's easier to stop such things in the european parliament , where there is no government coalition obeying every command from a chancellor or prime minister , than back home . 
   the only solution to this quagmire of problems is to either translate everything equally into all languages , or better , agree on a common language . 
  then translate everything . 
  a common language leads to a loss of culture . 
   businessmen and entrepreneurs will most likely disagree with you on that . 
  only businesses selling physical goods . 
  luckily , politics is n't a physical good . 
   guess why . 
  because hardly anyone communicates with their country 's meps at all . 
  at least that 's my interpretation . 
  could be . 
  after all , most issues are already handled at lower levels . 
   i do n't think you realize it , but with that statement you 've just disqualified everything you 've written so far . 
  the core question of democracy is : how do we prevent that someone installs a tyranny ? 
  the most common method is to install checks and balances in the form of separation of powers . 
  the intention is that everyone controls everyone else so that no one can take over the system . 
  that 's why the principle of division of labor does not work here : how are you supposed to assess whether the politicians you elect and the interest groups you donate to do their job properly ? 
  you have to replicate their work to a certain degree to make that assessment , and this can not be outsourced . 
  when people neglect that for whatever reasons , the end result will be italy under berlusconi : post-democracy in which the members of a political caste do what they want while the people bask in frustration over their powerlessness . 
  `` to a certain degree '' , that 's the point . 
   i like your cynicism . 
  i 'm do n't think of myself as cynical , but thanks . 
   usually when someone pulls the conspiracy theory card on me , i immediately end the discussion . 
  what makes you think that this is a conspiracy theory ? 
  parliamentarism was not unanimously popular back then , and if you look at the eu today you see that it is largely shaped by eu officials you have never heard off . 
  my guess is that over the years the eu became much more powerful than it was originally intended , so the democracy deficits are making themselves felt more painfully than envisioned back then . 
  this is also why i think the uk will withdraw completely from eu : they simply fear a too powerful european union because they fear a too powerful germany . 
  because there is no coherent plan for technocracy going from the league of nations to the treaty of lisbon . 
  the comparison to the league of nations is superficial at best . 
  and , despite what columnists on that page repeat every now and then , neither italy 's nor greece 's new prime minister got their new job in an unconstitutional way . 
   how about that on which your own country 's system is built ? 
  germany 's political system is one of the most robust of the world because it was shaped by the winners of wwii to ensure that something like hitler would not happen again . 
  they not only included many lessons learned from the weimar republic , but also their own democracies . 
  it would n't have been the worst approach to simply take the german constitution and model the eu from it .
