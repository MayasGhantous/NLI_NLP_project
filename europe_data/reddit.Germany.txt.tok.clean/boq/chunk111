  some democracies even prohibit that completely , when they take separation of powers more seriously . 
  what an odd criterion for democracy . 
  did you elect hague as foreign secretary ? 
  did we elect westerwelle ? 
  did the french elect jupp\u00e9 ? 
  the answer is no , thrice . 
  voting for individual positions in government , aside from the president in ( semi - ) presidential systems happens nowhere , as far as i know . 
  how about the parliament still ca n't initiate legislation . 
  read `` born and raised '' , expected to be bel-aired , was disappointed instead . 
  i do n't understand , unattractive ? 
  edit : no seriously , i did n't understand what that meant in this context . 
   he ran a members only site where he made profit and controlled the content . 
  yeah , so ? 
  he did n't offer copyrighted material for download . 
  `` the germans '' get it perfectly . 
  `` they '' just want to make sure this does n't happen again before `` they '' eventually take out the chequebook . 
  impending financial doom is a good way to get certain lazy governments to do their job . 
   he likely broke british law what law did he break ? 
  linking to torrent sites is akin to pointing over there and saying `` you can buy drugs there '' . 
  is that illegal , too ? 
   he should be extradited why ? 
  the uef was founded in 1946 in switzerland . 
  here 's more information : http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/how_to_act_against_acta, 
  star trek replicators did n't store their products as energy , there was a storage material that they converted from and to . 
  / nerd either way , it may sound like scifi today , but all you need for your steak is molecular resolution for the printer . 
  work in progress . 
   or imagine if we should ever invent replicators . 
  ahem : http://blog.zdf.de/dermarker/archives/7741, 
   so 16 % of the eu population can set the economic policy for the other 84 % . 
   i do not think the scotsman will like that or think it fair . 
  and they should n't . 
  but that 's what you get when you have a quasi-federal/confederal system with unequal members . 
  the powerful ones dictate . 
  a true federation has one citizen , one vote . 
  do n't worry , you have already been taken care of : http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/roaming/regulation/index_en.htm, 
  oh yes , our secret moon colony . 
  there will be a '' [ documentary ] ( http://www.ironsky.net/ ) '' on it in april . 
  i hope this gets better . 
  so far the comments on the right hand side are better than the opening remarks ... 
   merkel will be called on her bluff . 
  germany will suffer more than anyone else if the euro disappears . 
  this time , do n't even try to pull your imperialist fetish , germany . 
  this time , you 've got thousands of american and nato troops permanently stationed in your country . 
  careful , germany . 
  use your marks wisely . 
  [ on a continent filled with former empires , this is just golden .

  i 'm not sure if you just have a * very * dry humour or are really serious . 
  turns out we did all meet up and say '' [ zis time ve do it wiz currency manipulation !,

  more importantly , why did no one tell us we could do this 100 years ago ? 
  things could have been so much easier and more civilised , really . 
  not sure if that 's what they meant when they said we need more of a common european culture .

  [ the shard ] ( http://mirrorsedge.wikia.com/wiki/the_shard ) ? 
   as far as i know , efta members , i.e. 
  switzerland , do n't have to implement regulations based on eu treaties . 
  that would make no sense at all . 
  they are just a part of free market . 
  of course they do . 
  the market needs common rules , else it would n't be fair . 
   minimum taxes , common fisheries policy and everything else that drives eu to a pure socialism . 
  can we leave the `` socialism !!, 
  ! 11 '' to the american republicans ? 
  this has absolutely nothing to do with socialism . 
   n. farage explains well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aftvk_3qs8  also daniel hannan http://euroseptik.cz/dan-hannan-radeji-efta-nez-eu/ please . 
   i think every country is better of outside the eu . 
  even germany and france , who might be the biggest contributors ( combined with the most political influence , where sarkozy and merkel actually decide ) , because their citizens would n't have to sponsor/give money to other countries . 
  how does that make sense ? 
  obviously at least the receiving countries are better off because of the aid . 
  that 's commendable . 
  however , you should n't think reading such a document once is enough to think it through completely . 
  if i wanted to cement my power in a country i 'd make sure to have some plausible deniability by making critical legislation less obvious . 
  edit : for example the article about the media mentions another , more detailed law . 
  unless we read that one , too , how can we assess the state of press freedom correctly ? 
  judges use lawgivers . 
  reads like a german dialect to me . 
  blocked in germany . 
  unbelievable . 
  i agree mostly with the content but i do n't know why he calls it `` centralized '' and mentions subsidiarity only with one meagre sentence . 
  it 's an important , maybe the most important aspect . 
   the czech penal code also applies to endorsing movements that oppress human rights and freedoms . 
  can anyone with more knowledge tell me what defines such a movement ? 
   that 's the reason why the eu does n't work . 
  maybe we have a different sense of liberty but anyone trying to `` keep us in line '' will get their hand bitten off . 
  that 's why every neighbourhood in the uk gets to do whatever it wants . 
  because nobody keeps them in line !, 
  anarchy in the uk !, 
  seriously . 
  here * he * lost a good opportunity to shut up . 
  [ this ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fehmarnbelt-querung#die_feste_fehmarnbelt-querung ) makes it look like there are quite a few reasons for building it . 
  you just say the locals do n't like it ( sure , nimby knows no borders ) and traffic wo n't be so big anyway but do n't provide any citations . 
  i hope that 's not the way you intend to do politics up there . 
  do you have a link to a more substantiated reason ? 
  i 'm sure someone dumped something somewhere in the wiki , right ? 
  why ? 
  i guess i 'm part of a growing minority ( hopefully growing , unfortunately minority ) that does n't ( want to ) consider the rest of europe as abroad . 
  and why did the uk/nl have to pay deposit guarantees to customers of an icelandic bank ? 
  so it 's ok for iceland to reap benefits from their banking laws but not pay back the dues that come from the same banking laws when the whole thing comes down ? 
   ( ... ) by failing to ensure payment of the minimum amount of compensation to icesave depositors in the netherlands and in the uk ( ... ) within the time limits ( ... ) , iceland has failed to comply with [ its ] obligations ( ... ) so , iceland promised to guarantee deposits and did not do so .
