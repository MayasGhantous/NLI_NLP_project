  at least not as of two weeks ago . 
  does that not back * me * up ? 
  were the deposit guarantees not a result of * democratically * adopted laws ? 
  that they paid what they guaranteed to all depositors without any kind of discrimination . 
  do you have a citation at hand ? 
  thank you . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but as far as i know , iceland got a lot of people to put money in its banks by making promises it did n't keep in the end ( deposit guarantees ) . 
  what kind of utopia is that supposed to be ? 
  they could already do that , absentee ballots and so on . 
  special mps for those abroad , only electable by those abroad will focus on their voters interests , i.e. 
  those living abroad , wherever they may be . 
  we could have that by allowing them to vote in national elections wherever they are : i 'm sure some politician will recognize the voting potential and campaign on issues relevant to french expats or whoever is living there . 
  after a few years , yes . 
  until then ? 
  do they really feel a strong connection or do they just want their interests represented ? 
  i have a feeling it 's more the latter . 
  at least within the eu , this is a waste of money . 
  ca n't we just exchange voting rights ? 
  let the french in germany vote for the bundestag and the germans in france for l\u2019assembl\u00e9e nationale . 
  done . 
  what do you mean by `` level on which people engage culturally with each other needs to match with the level on which political decisions are made '' ? 
  i 'm know those words but i 'm too dense to make out their combined meaning . 
  what is the level of cultural engagement and how does it relate to political decisions ? 
  do you have an example , perhaps ? 
  how would you measure diversity ? 
  number of languages , dishes , musical styles ? 
  are all cultural traits considered worthy of conservation ? 
  i do n't think i can answer your question . 
  you asked : `` do you think it will survive literacy and modern communications ? '', 
  i assumed `` it '' referred to india as a country . 
  i said yes , because india 's middle class ( that overcame illiteracy and uses modern communication ) seems not to wish breaking up india . 
  i 'm more of a geographical determinist so i do n't think culture will be harmed noticeably , that is beyond the usual changes that cultures always go through over time . 
  true . 
  but the most important/decisive point ? 
  i 'm not convinced . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/world/asia/24iht-letter24.html?_r=1 ) :  but , despite all the tensions , the idea of nationhood is stronger than ever , ** especially among the middle class ** . 
  a united india is a cherished ideal of almost every indian . 
   the moral of the indian story for the european union is that what holds a nation together is not the virtues of its people , but very simply time and habit . 
  as most indians would testify from the lives of their parents , an arranged marriage grows stronger in time , especially when divorce is unthinkable . 
  thanks for the link , really interesting . 
  if we vote for sellouts , we deserve it . 
  ( hence , * strong * civil society . ), 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not really arguing for a federal world because that is still a rather distant idea . 
  let 's stick to europe for now , please . 
   india fits the narrative perfectly . 
   it has more than 80 million people outcasted from society into abject poverty and misery . 
   let me ask you then why you left this fact out of your post ( which is probably a textbook example of bullshit and propaganda ) ? 
   india fits the narrative perfectly indeed . 
  not at all . 
  you argue for imperialistic tendencies that will stamp out minority cultures , but said 80 million are no evidence for that . 
  after all , india is still a developing country . 
  the country still has widely supported laws that protect minority languages and cultures . 
  it has dominant regions that do n't destabilise the entire country . 
  this goes completely against what you wrote , especially since europe practices that kind of protection even more vigorously . 
  who ? 
  this post is probably a textbook example of [ fud ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt ) . 
  the entire argument is based on the imaginary prospect of cultural imperialism that * no one * is going at . 
  and why are you , for example , leaving out india in your list of past mistakes ? 
  it has 29 languages with over 1 million speakers , laws in place to protect said languages and various minorities . 
  but it does n't fit the narrative , does it ? 
  look at my flag . 
  now back to my country 's flag . 
  luckily , it 's not the same . 
  and we are the 2nd largest bundesland by population ( 15 % ) and gdp ( 17 % ) . 
  so far our `` attempts '' to take over the republic have failed miserably . 
  strong civil society beats corporations . 
  those who tell us that corporate power is overwhelming only benefit from our cynicism . 
  that 's why federal systems have two chambers . 
  one represents the people , one the member states . 
  please read the response i linked to .

  but , truth be told , i eat b\u00e4rentatzen all year round ... that 's how wonferful they are . 
  that claim of british irrelevancy is bollocks . 
  in the council , the uk has the same number of votes as italy , france or germany . 
  in the parliament , the uk has the same number as france or italy . 
  only germany has more , 99 instead of 72 . 
  those 99 , however , are spread over 5 , not 4 blocs . 
  thanks for the link . 
  anyway , to me it looks like it 's understood that france wo n't be outvoted but has no legal instrument to stop it from happening . 
  it will , of course , cost the others a lot of political capital . 
  europe is a little bigger than sweden or madeira . 
  the experiences ca n't just be scaled up . 
  at some point this becomes organised crime . 
  i do n't understand . 
  why would cameron be told the transaction tax would not be an option ? 
  would n't he tell them that ? 
  apparently they were unreasonable . 
  more in [ my other response to you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/nf2u8/more_problems_than_answers_the_pitfalls_of_the/c38ngaj?context=1 ) . 
  apparently cameron asked to move back certain types of regulations into the domain of unanimity . 
  at the moment they are subject to qualified majority voting . 
  he was turned down . 
  that 's how i understood it [ from the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2011/12/britain-and-eu-1 ) :  what they asked for was a protocol imposing decision-making by unanimity on a number of areas of regulation currently decided by majority voting . 
  ( if you want to be really technical , the choice is voting by unanimity or the special qualified majority voting ( qmv ) used in the eu , which is a sort of super-majority system taking into account a certain number of countries and also their populations ) . 
    as my source puts it , this amounted to a big winding-back of the clock for many eu leaders , setting a `` horrendous precedent '' that could unravel the single market . 
  as they see it , common rules for the common market have been adopted ( with few exceptions , such as tax ) by qmv ever since the single european act approved by margaret thatcher in 1986 . crsp now claims french farmers , spanish fishermen , german car manufacturers have some kind of protection and wants that protection extended to britain 's financial industry . 
  i 'd like to know through what clauses in the treaties or its protocols there is any kind of unanimity-based protection for said french , spanish or german industries . 
  your linked pdf continues as following :  it suggests that france ( or at least mr. chirac ) believed that france should not be outvoted on matters of supreme importance . 
  the european council would have been the better institutional setting for chirac , since unanimity is the decision-making rule and there were better opportunities for issue linkage . 
  a french attempt to veto a qualified majority vote in the coam would , politically , be much more controversial than lack of unanimity in the european council . 
  it appears like this was just empty rhetoric by chirac .
