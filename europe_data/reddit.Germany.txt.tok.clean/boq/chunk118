  a tokamak , like any magnetically confined device , has confining fields on all sides , too . 
  it has to : as soon as the plasma touches the wall , it 's pretty much done . 
  the fields consist of two main parts : a ) the toroidal field . 
  it is created by the toroidal field coils that enclose the torus . 
  b ) the poloidal field . 
  it is created by the electrical current driven toroidally through the plasma by the oh coils ( ohmic heating ) -- like a transformator . 
  together these fields create a toroidally closed screw-pinch . 
  if it 's any consolation , i 've seen some members of the german media use gips as an acronym recently . 
   `` if we increase the plasma volume drastically , the heat losses decrease automatically , '' explains hasinger . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-63216700.html -- hasinger was the director of germany 's max-planck-institut for plasma physics until last year polywells are a very obscure part of plasma physics , i personally would n't bet any money on it . 
  here 's an \u00fc for you . 
  and some \u00c4\u00e4\u00d6\u00f6\u00dc\u00fc . 
  you get an umlaut !, 
  you get an umlaut !, 
  technically van rompuy was `` elected '' by the council . 
  but that 's really not that important , his only power is scheduling council meetings ... 
  all federal countries i know of have such a system in place and * it * does n't bankrupt them . 
  my browser just crashed after i wrote a lengthy answer , so this will be shorter and cruder . 
  a game is fair if a ) the players are of similar influence or b ) there is a superior authority that makes sure there is no abuse of power . 
  in the past no such thing existed in europe and it led to tensions . 
  we can also observe similar imbalances on a global scale . 
  they will get larger in the future as developing nations become heavy-weights . 
  in the foreseeable future no global superior authority will exist to address that . 
  at the same time europe can address both its internal imbalances and its global relative decline by communalising two key policy areas : economic and foreign policy . 
  that has been tried so far through intergovernmentalism with varying success , to put it lightly . 
  i do n't see how we could resolve these problems without democratically federalising those areas of policy . 
  what 's your idea ? 
  i 'm at work , i 'll try to get you an answer when i 'm home . 
  well , how would you like to address the inequalities within europe and beyond ? 
  i 'm afraid we only agree superficially . 
  lumping unequal countries together will result in power imbalances . 
  everyone knew that but failed to create an adequate and fully democratic political framework to deal with it . 
  create a loose union with strong nation states complain that there are strong nation states, 
  i 'm probably not bright enough to understand the causal link . 
  how * exactly * did the eu oust him ? 
  there is an entire spectrum between `` nothing '' and `` use '' . 
  at what point has it gone so far that it is a federal state ? 
  these details are exactly what is important . 
  all right then . 
  federal is word that is bugging you ? 
  i was arguing in favour of the word state in `` federal state '' , nothing else . 
  `` federal '' just describes one way of organising it while preserving the different cultures more easily . 
  i still do n't see how you can say that `` perfect '' is any more clear . 
  the phrase complete union would not describe some kind of natural state of completeness that is inherent in some kind of unions . 
  it is still up for interpretation . 
  today americans still have supreme court cases interpreting what the federal government can and ca n't do , so it can not be that unambiguous . 
  `` ever closer union among the peoples of europe '' is not just `` closer '' . 
  it describes an asymptotic movement limited by the preservation of the individual european peoples . 
  as for my language skills : a ) i actually have a certificate from a very well known british university that says otherwise and b ) i linked to the dictionary and did take into account the meaning `` complete '' . 
  you just cut that off in your quotation . 
  well done there . 
  again , it does n't say what complete means , even in the historical context , which i am well aware of , thank you . 
  so yeah , as your answer was again nothing more but `` nuh-uh '' with an insulting undertone , i 'm done here . 
  i have laid out why federalism was and remains the original goal of the project . 
  the closest union does not have place for numerous countries -- if it did , it would n't be the * closest * union yet -- but it can not preserve the peoples unless it is federally , as opposed to centrally , organised . 
  claiming that `` perfect union '' would be any more unambiguous than `` ever closer '' is ridiculous . 
  '' [ perfect ] ( http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/perfect ) '' can be interpreted in any way , it simply depends on what someone considers perfect . 
  even using the interpretation of `` absolute '' or `` complete '' does n't say what is considered absolute or complete . 
  '' [ close ] ( http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/close ) '' is far less ambiguous , it describes the reduction of some distance . 
  that , of course , means that certain things that existed in that distance , borders for example , will have to be abolished to move closer . 
  that process is completed once everything that can be removed has been removed : the closest union . 
  your previous , vague answer of `` closer co-operation '' does n't suggest a similar or comparable process that results in a closest union . 
   if germans do n't like the british veto , or voting how they see fit , they 're free to go and form their own little club with southern europe and the statists . 
  as the article points out , britain is not leading some sort of club of the 10 outsiders :  some in britain talk of leading a block of ten `` outs '' . 
  no such block exists . 
  you are forgetting the rest of the quotation , `` an ever closer union among the peoples of europe '' and then make up the rest as you go . 
  it does n't say ever closer union of * nations * , but * peoples * . 
  an ever closer union of peoples means eventually merging all but the peoples themselves , including the sovereign nation states . 
  we want to preserve the different cultures -- which is what generally defines peoples nowadays -- so federalism instead of centralism is the way to go . 
  besides , the phrase clearly resembles `` a more perfect union '' from the american constitution . 
  that 's not by accident . 
  but if britons have changed their mind , they are free to go . 
  all right , what is your interpretation ? 
  um , the euro was a french idea . 
  and only denmark and the uk have a permanent opt-out from the euro , all other member states have agreed to adopt the euro in the future . 
  and there is , in fact , a european idea . 
  it says so in all the treaties : to form an ever closer union . 
  i 'd rather have them pay off the debt . 
  or not [ cut the rest of the science funding to fund iter ] ( http://news.google.de/news/more?hl=de&amp;q=iter&amp;um=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.cf.osb&amp;biw=1143&amp;bih=844&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;ncl=drae9-alfaglsvmnjkuzpfkvedo9m&amp;ei=vb63trgymc66hafd3lcaba&amp;sa=x&amp;oi=news_result&amp;ct=more-results&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0cc4qqgiwaa ) ( though i support fusion research ) . 
  necessary power ? 
  you sounded like you were inviting us !, 
  that 's not how parliamentary influence is determined . 
  how probable is it that a german changing his vote results in a different result in parliament compared to a greek ? 
  that 's * way * harder to calculate for isolated elections for a common parliament . 
  you do n't need hypothetical arguments . 
  california has a similar system of direct democracy as switzerland . 
  look how that works out . 
   historically , the more power a people had over its politics , the better off it was . 
  you ... just made that up . 
  before the euro , greece had 15-30 % inflation every year . 
  that means their wages went down similarly through depreciation of their currency . 
  for the last 10 years they had less than 3 % of inflation , but they did n't change their way of running greece . 
  that 's catching up with them now , including huge pay cuts . 
  it was to be expected and there is not much they can do about it . 
  it will happen in the euro , it would happen if they left and their new currency tanked . 
  why ? 
  yeah , not so [ united ] ( http://bigthink.com/ideas/21455 ) , eh ... : - /, 
  you mean buying the land from the ottoman owners ( or whoever had it back then , certainly not the british ) from the 19th century on . 
  operation gelungen , patient tot !, 
  leaving a currency that remains in use sounds like open-heart surgery .
