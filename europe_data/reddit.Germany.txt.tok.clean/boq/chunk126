  over 500 million comparatively rich europeans start tightening internal borders because of maybe 30 ' 000 or so attempted entries . 
  ridiculous scare tactics . 
  i do n't read it . 
  largest german daily newspaper for economy and finance . 
  no problem : median income eu27 in 2009 : ~ 14,600 $ ( from [ eurostat ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_di03&amp;lang=en ) , provided i understand that table correctly ) median income usa in 2009 : ~ 23,200 $ with today 's exchange rate ( from [ wa ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=median+income+usa ) ) i think even when considering errors the us should come out on top . 
  quite frankly , i 'm outraged . 
  chipping away another european achievement . 
  i 'm not emotional . 
  i just pointed out that there is no inherent or obvious geographical border between europa and asia . 
  someone just decided that certain regions should be considered as such . 
  your link even confirms that :  yet the borders for europe -- a concept dating back to classical antiquity -- are somewhat arbitrary , as the term `` continent '' can refer to a cultural and political distinction or a physiographic one . 
   the geographical border is ( ... ) ... [ absolutely arbitrary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_plate ) . 
  huh , american income is higher than ours : http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=average+income+usa+eu, 
  do we have to take * all * of them back ? 
  you call it strength when half of us follow the us into iraq ? 
  a unified foreign and defence policy would have had a different outcome . 
  ( as an example ), 
   but it was voted on and ( so far ) found to be legitimate within the contextual controls set for the democratic process ; you do n't have to like it . 
  the question of this post was which country in europe has the best political system . 
  the swiss system allows these decisions , hence i do n't consider it the best . 
  that 's all . 
  i have no desire to convince anyone in switzerland to change it . 
  maybe i should rephrase that . 
  i care about results first . 
  that 's how i measure the quality of a democracy . 
  if the outcome is n't necessarily better , what good is voting often ? 
  in that regard , i do n't see switzerland as a model . 
  now you 're probably going to say that which decision is good or bad is an opinion . 
  at least that 's what i get out of the implication you concluded . 
  i disagree with that notion . 
  correct me if i got that wrong . 
  anyway , that assumes that all opinions are equally valid , which they are not . 
  some decisions are ( objectively ) better than others . 
  if more direct voting produces more of them , awesome , where do i sign up ? 
  if not , meh , whatever . 
  ( the footnotes were n't context-free . 
  you claimed your voters tended to be informed and engaged . 
  i gave two examples where that assessment might be doubted . ), 
  what you are listing is much more than just `` more voting = more democracy '' . 
  it does work for you most of the time , and like you i do n't think it would work for many others . 
  that being said , i think there are some decisions that cast a damning light like no women 's right to vote till 1971/1990 or banning of certain religious buildings . 
  ( two things that together i find ironic , seeing that afaik women were mostly in favour of the ban despite them having been able to vote decades earlier in iran or turkey than in switzerland . ), 
  really , retroactive ? 
  awesome , 
  the belief that more direct voting equals more democracy . 
  ( edit : which i do n't share . ), 
  eastern europeans do n't need jobs ? 
  compared to what european economy are germany 's and austria 's economies struggling ? 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  french or romanian would be ok , too . 
  really , the only ones ? 
  the overwhelming majority of cctv is private . 
  speech is regulated already . 
  slippery slope is n't that convincing here , imho . 
  who can deny that the bbc ( for example ) is a wonderful and relatively unbiased source of information that is envied around the world ? 
  not necessarily . 
  you can have something like a right of reply where the misrepresented party has a right to respond on the same medium . 
  for example . 
  * un mandate * agreement by the arab league, 
  lemonade ? 
  the country of troy and constantinople is n't european ? 
  well , that 's kind of odd , imho . 
  the laws are passed by qualified majority voting . 
  at least 50 % of the countries with at least 74 % of the votes have to agree together with parliament . 
  hypothetically , at the moment turkey would be 1 country out of 28 with 29 votes out of 374 in the council . 
  they 'd get about as many seats as germany in parliament ( a bit over 10 % ) . 
  so they 'd only need 14 other countries with 159 council votes and almost half of parliament on their side to get something done . 
  let 's be realistic , they could n't force their will on anyone . 
  not without substantial support from other members . 
  there are legitimate concern about turkey 's accession , but * this * ist just right wing fud . 
  here 's one : [ age pyramid eu ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php?title=file:age_pyramid,_eu-27,_2007%28%25_of_total_population%29.png&amp;filetimestamp=20090430100031 ) vs [ age pyramid turkey ] ( http://tfw.cachefly.net/snm/images/nm/pyramids/tu-2010.png ) . 
  here 's another one : [ nabucco pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucco_pipeline ) . 
  ( personally , i think * this * is why romania and bulgaria are already eu members today . ), 
  [ wikipedia says # 003399 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe#colours ) and that 's [ exactly what it is ] ( http://i.imgur.com/etrmo.png ) . 
  fun fact : when france joined the eec , the majority of its territory was in africa ( algeria ) . 
  another one : when denmark joined , the majority of its territory was in north america ( greenland ) . 
  one of the rare cases where the poorer part of the country encourages the rich part to secede . 
  ok , it 's settled then . 
  man the ships , we 're invad ... inviting canada !, 
  i hope everyone likes it . 
  as a last suggestion , i would add margin-top :7 px ; to the css so it says / * banner * / . side { margin-top :7 px ; padding : 135px 1px 0px 0px ; background-image : url ( http://thumbs.reddit.com/t5_2qh4j_2.png?v=l714kxd7i02998k9my72eyfpsn5mtdhtg42j ) ; background-repeat : no-repeat } else the / r/europe is so close to the top that it highlights the light blue border in an odd way . 
  see here the difference : [ without 7px margin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4xknw.png ) [ with 7px margin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hgpwz.png ) let 's see how many people there will be in the channel ... 
  i 'm already spending way too much time on reddit as it is ;-), 
  the euro logo is n't mine . 
  i just photoshopped it into [ this submission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/f419j/logo_wanted/ ) . 
  it is the flag of europe . 
  the eu adopted it but it was commissioned by the [ coe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_of_europe ) . 
  i do n't see how voting for the commission is more democratic than approving it en bloc ( it 's not like national parliaments vote on every minister ) , but okay , whatever . 
  since it 's a union of countries i 'm okay with that but i can see why some might not be . 
  and also the thing is all politics are back room deals . 
  everywhere . 
  even in city councils . 
  that will never change , nowhere . 
  naturally , i ca n't prove that to you . 
  about the water ... 
  i 'm not aware of any directives . 
  do you have a link ? 
  either way , there are modern aqueducts that transport water over hundreds of km . 
  i do n't see why the eu ca n't transport water for agriculture or industry to the south . 
  that does n't even need to be drinking water quality .
