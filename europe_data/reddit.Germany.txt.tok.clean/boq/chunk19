  do you not understand what a `` prospect '' is ? 
  kosovo is decades from membership away . 
  comment is free is a glorified blog . 
  ok , then divide the uk in 6-7 districts or states and apply the solutions there . 
  not sure if a corruption * perception * index comparison to the us really says much . 
  many americans also think they 're number one in science and maths while in reality they 're somewhere after place 20 . 
  so , perhaps america also perceives itself as less corrupt than it really is . 
  regardless , even if the index is an accurate measure of corruption , evidently the scandinavian/nordic model shows better results than the anglo-saxon one so i do n't see why we should follow the latter rather than the former . 
  umm ? 
  you can do that , too . 
  can someone tell us what that is exactly ? 
  a faux news report pretending to be from 1944 ? 
  two , if anything . 
  why would they need to do that ? 
  ca n't they just be like , say , bulgaria instead and do nothing ? 
  run off please . 
  although a directly elected president kind of defies most of our democratic traditions , most states having a chancellor or prime minister . 
  what 's different in the cypriot kind ? 
  no , i like gyros more , too . 
  do you make it the same way they do in greece/chalkidiki ? 
  heh , we have that in munich too : studentenstadt . 
  many countries in europe feel the need to be under america 's security umbrella against russia . 
  considering how western europe has reacted so far , i ca n't blame them . 
   the proper speed limit ( hint : none ) \\* schn\u00fcff * freiheit !, 
  i was commenting on the surveillance . 
  enough hypotheticals . 
  this has been going on for years . 
  it 's time we see some hard evidence that these government transgressions had some positive effect . 
   who puts milk into their hot leaf juice ? 
  silence , philistine . 
  you know nothing !, 
  the milk 's fat helps transport the flavour . 
  it 's fantastic !, 
  tea without milk ? 
  never !, 
  but i am le tired . 
  by that reasoning , people could only choose a doctor for themselves if they were smart enough to heal themselves . 
  evidently that is n't the case . 
  it was not the same and no government was punished by the voters for ratifying it . 
  that 's all we can really say . 
  perhaps they really had a problem with the symbolism only , perhaps , as some exit polls suggest , they did n't give a damn about the treaty and just wanted to punish their own government . 
  either way , whether there is a referendum or not falls under national jurisdiction , so if someone should be blamed , it 's the national governments who did n't hold another referendum . 
  money is just a coordinate system for describing economic activity , but it itself is not wealth . 
  if the activities of banks do n't lead to real growth , i.e. 
  new jobs , new tangible wealth , stuff like that , then they only shuffled money around . 
  we can inflate our gdp just fine by just moving money around , but no one will be better off , except perhaps the bankers who take home their commission . 
  the french did n't vote on the lisbon treaty and the irish said yes once their wishes were respected . 
  this is not voting until it 's the right way , no matter how often you repeat it . 
  western republics are all democratic republics . 
  the two terms are not mutually exclusive . 
  how exactly can you say that ? 
  did you read [ the entire report ] ( http://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/asc/reports_asc_4_1406.pdf?4fa1ede5965b4df5613605d6bab04a6b ) ? 
  this is n't some politician banging on about immigrants , you know . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  it says banks are already big enough to accommodate the economy and further growth in that sector would not yield any more growth in the real economy . 
  the magic word is `` marginal . '', 
  i would really like to get to the bottom of this , but unless we find some numbers we can probably postpone this discussion . 
  they have more capital at their disposal , i.e. 
  they can invest into riskier things without risking everything they have . 
  bonds are considered fairly safe , something for life insurances or pensions to be based on . 
  it would be good if we had an idea of who holds most of our bonds . 
  unfortunately i do n't have numbers at hand , but what i recall says that it 's not the rich people who hold most of them . 
  do you have some numbers perhaps ? 
  for completeness , i do n't really oppose quantitative easing . 
  but i think we must understand that it 's not a silver bullet and it will hurt some people that do n't deserve it . 
  no , rich people do n't sit on mountains of cash . 
  they invest in the right things , and then they stop caring about inflation -- physical objects do n't devalue when you print money . 
  the people who get screwed are the ones who rely on the stability of the money , those who wo n't easily get their wages raised , pensioners , savers , and so on . 
  that 's consistent with your article : the us has been using quantitative easing for a while now , exactly for the benefit of the rich , not the poor . 
  devaluation can be anything , but it has * openly not * been an option in the eurozone for more than a decade -- and everyone agreed to that . 
  that can be good or bad , but at the end of the day everyone knew that other instruments must be used to guide the economy and should have done just that . 
  that 's interesting . 
  has this always been like that in scotland or was there ever a phase when the english custom prevailed ? 
  [ people ] ( http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/when-will-europes-real-estate-bubble-burst/ ) recognised it . 
  but openly taking money out of someone 's pocket with a tax is unpopular . 
  better to do it clandestinely through the central bank -- that difference is what i meant with `` real . '', 
  well , i guess then my alleged comment falls under the reddit statute of limitations :-), 
  you do n't * need * devaluation . 
  all it does can be accomplished using real policy as well , they just have to be in place in time . 
  for instance , a housing bubble can be prevented by discouraging investments into real estate with appropriate policies , e.g. 
  tax hikes on real estate . 
  just adopting a different currency and continuing like nothing has changed will lead and has lead to problems . 
  that was the mistake : adopting a very stable currency and continuing as if the currency could just be devalued in case of problems . 
  a ) you 're not helping your case about the present by citing dead philosophers . 
  5 years after voltaire died , the french did n't just limit the power of kings , they cut off their heads . 
  equally , what montesquieu may have remarked centuries ago has long been incorporated into continental legal tradition -- that 's why the concept of negative liberty is also taught over here . 
  in this day and age , claiming it as some sort of british exclusive is nothing less than absurd . 
  b ) i really doubt i ever called you a racist , but if you can show me where i did that , i will apologise . 
  though i 'm not sure why you brought up ethopia or japan . 
  the reasons that including them into a * contemporary european * federation would probably be a bad idea are purely practical and do n't even have to get to the point where we 'd have to cite alleged cultural incompatibilities . 
  but i was always a trekkie , so who knows what the future brings :-), 
  the reason things in your country are the way they are is because of the people in your country . 
  it 's no longer because of a foreign-sponsored dictatorship . 
  hungary 's fate is in hungarians ' hands . 
  but , nafta is just that , a ** f ** ree ** t ** rade ** a ** greement . 
  it 's not a common market . 
  the economic integration is laughable in comparison to ours . 
  both legal systems have been converging to a point where the differences are perhaps relevant for scholars and lawyers perhaps , but not the general population . 
  you can get a fair trial everywhere in the west . 
   i do n't think calling people chauvinists helps .
