  i do hope that several assistants to one mep do the majority of the work compared to that one mep . 
  you mean , you * could * emigrate as opposed to before when everyone was imprisoned . 
  ok , assuming that 's true , just pick another city in the us . 
  still better than $ randomplace in the former east . 
  the point is , these are parts of one city that was known for its shitty situation back then . 
  most places looked better . 
  but you can pick a random place from the eastern bloc before 1990 and it 's going to be fairly similar . 
  do n't know what family you had , but neither the parts of my family in the city nor in the countryside lived better than now . 
  to be fair , people * abandoned * these places . 
   meanwhile , in ** the bronx and harlem ** . 
  ftfy, 
  i do n't know much about your second bullet point , but the rest is precisely because the member states did n't give the common institutions the necessary powers . 
  the union has almost no powers by itself , it 's utterly dependent on the member states . 
  if their representatives in the ecb or at the efsf/esm say no , it 's really no . 
  if they do n't give the common institutions a way to enforce coordinated economic policy , well , you know what happened . 
  politicians making 180s is n't exactly new . 
  what she dismisses before the election might not be dismissed afterwards . 
  i think that 's because they do n't subsidise them like us and contrary to what some claim , they are not that cheap , yet . 
  gas is necessary as a backup for renewables . 
  how would it undermine the push ? 
  anyway , i heard the same thing re environment in a talk given by the head of the german office for geology and resources . 
  that germany already did fracking since the 60s is probably more evidence for this statement . 
  merkel always says there wo n't be a `` befreiungsschlag '' or coup de liberation . 
  so , i guess there might be small steps , starting perhaps with eurobonds for the first 60 % or so of national debt . 
  taxation i 'm not sure . 
  imho the eu could get a base portion of the vat . 
  perhaps that would suffice as justification to install a european tax collecting agency that will crack down on certain parts of the eu . 
  i have no idea about time frames though . 
  perhaps the first steps will come in june . 
  germany has no elections for 3 + years , so it 's probably enough time to implement unpopular policy . 
  i agree . 
  without the euro , there wo n't be cross-border supply chains because exchange rate risk remains . 
  the economies will not grow together properly , there will remain national boundaries . 
  these can be exploited , undermining the political project . 
  ( free state is the german term for republic . 
  it has nothing to do with freedom from germany or anything comparable . 
  it 's freedom from the monarch . 
  same goes for saxony or thuringia . ), 
  i mean ... bayern !, 
  yes !, 
  were many people against it ? 
  did someone claim the change would threaten the swedish way of life ? 
  do n't know yet . 
  it all depends on the details , so i guess i 'll cross that bridge when we get there . 
  and you ? 
  you need to stop putting words in other people 's mouths/posts . 
  i did n't write that and what i wrote can hardly be interpreted that way . 
  i do n't care for a plan b. 
  the alternatives are all equally crappy in my view . 
  personally , i will do what i can do get europe on the right track but if it 's not going to happen , i do n't have to stay here if life 's better somewhere else . 
  i 'm not trying to piss you off , but you really need to work on your reading comprehension . 
  i really went out of my way to say that i think it 's probably ** not ** going to happen but that it better ** should ** . 
  i have no magic way . 
  perhaps you 'd have to find a bunch of politicians charismatic and daring enough to convince the people of it . 
  reason wo n't suffice . 
  i did write that i do n't think that it will happen easily . 
  i also wrote that i think the americans were lucky because in their formation the people need n't be asked . 
  the states ' congresses simply ratified a new constitution and that was that . 
  i also wrote that this wo n't work for us . 
  my central message is that while this will be , in the long term , not good for europe , today 's europeans might all just be too self-absorbed to consider all implications . 
  you are basically making up numbers . 
  i 'm not going to debate your fantasy . 
  decolonisation has taken place . 
  those still belonging to their european colonisers are * willingly * part of a european country . 
  the plan is easy . 
  the wealthy parts need to open their coffers , the poorer parts need to give up some competencies to fix the issues ( and vice versa , technically ) . 
  will it happen ? 
  probably not so easily . 
  should it happen ? 
  yes . 
  everyone needs to take a step back or this will unnecessarily drag on and be more painful than it has to be . 
  we 'll pay either way . 
  either openly through a transfer system , or through limits on our trade and our self-determination - which i value enough to shell out money to keep . 
  i also notice that you did n't dispute american hegemony . 
  i 'd prefer them as partners , not as hegemons around here , too . 
  edit : also , the forever is questionable . 
  bavaria used to be a net receiver of money till the 90s , now it 's one of the biggest contributors to the intra-german transfer . 
  you might not . 
  lucky for the americans , their institutional setup was established at a time when other methods were acceptable . 
  but these methods are thankfully no longer open to us . 
  so either the individual european nations realise they each have to take a step back for the whole to be successful , or they can choose whose vassal they want to be . 
  the current choices are washington or moscow , but i hear beijing is coming up fast , too . 
  no , that part of the family has no special connection to germany . 
  the russian joke is now `` to protect russian speakers '' and america 's is `` to spread democracy '' . 
  heh , that 's just 30km from my cousin 's farm . 
   it especially pisses me off , when guys like cgp grey ( / u/mindofmetalandwheels ) advocate to stop teaching/learning foreign languages for english speaking countries . 
  - this means everyone else still has to learn english to some degree ... 
  this annoys me too , but not for your reason . 
  it deprives native english speakers of a lot of things . 
  there just are experiences that you ca n't have with english only . 
  you 'll never get a real understanding of the hierarchies in japanes society , for example , if you do n't try to learn their language a bit . 
  cultures and languages are intertwined to a certain degree , and the self-imposed language barrier is a detriment to them , not us . 
  i 'm always reminded of a way of thinking a friend introduced me to , which he called the four phases of enlightenment ( turns out it 's based on [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_stages_of_competence ) ) . 
  unconscious incompetence : you 've never driven a car and ca n't even imagine what could be hard about driving one . 
  conscious incompetence : you 're in the car , first driving lesson , you ca n't even move 5m without trouble . 
  turns out there are challenges !, 
  conscious competence : you 've been driving a few times and can now do it if you concentrate . 
  but become inattentive , and you 're back at 2 . 
  unconscious competence : after 10 years the car has become an extension of your body . 
  you fly over the autobahn as if you had been born there .
