  no , seriously , they are de facto subject to most eu regulations and have to pay for that privilege , without a say in them . 
  the de jure situation is really secondary , considering that 25 % of switzerland 's economy rely on eu trade while in reverse it 's only 0.8 % \\* . 
  but yeah , fine , if you are okay with implementing most of the eu 's rules and also paying into its coffers for the ability to sign free trade agreements with someone else ( perhaps a few years earlier but probably with worse conditions than a bigger bloc could achieve ) , then it probably looks good to you . 
  \\* the same numbers for the uk are ~ 10 % vs. ~ 1.5 %, 
  not really . 
  total rejection of a regulation is a purely theoretical option as it would trigger retaliation by the eu through the [ guillotine clause ] ( http://www.isn.ethz.ch/digital-library/articles/detail/?lng=en&amp;id=96267 ) . 
  what they can do is re-formulate the implementation in swiss law , but eu members can do the same . 
  except , members can also use the eu institutions to change or scrap existing regulations . 
  switzerland can only call the european court of justice . 
  no , actually they do n't : http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/switzerland_falls_into_line_with_eu_laws.html?cid=7639686 same goes for the norwegians : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20830201, 
  are there people who study euro coin diffusion ? 
  i admit that there were some mistakes made during the accession of bulgaria and romania ( my old country ) . 
  yet , at least in romania , substantial progress has already been made . 
  i think you have no idea how staggering the different levels of corruption really are . 
  yes , well , to be honest , i 've only seen one gyros booth in munich . 
  and it closed after a while because its location was bad . 
  but i 've seen many in greece and they are delicious . 
  not only do they use pork , but they also prepare everything more or less differently than doener . 
  ca n't we get the exact same mcdonald 's burger here , too ? 
  btw my vote goes to gyros rather than doener . 
  there , i said it . 
  ha , pickpockets should put up these signs themselves . 
  just go to dover and start throwing rocks into the channel . 
  before you know it , no more channel . 
  additional flags are like minorities ' rights . 
  they do n't take away your own . 
  when i 'm travelling through europe , the flag always makes me feel more at home . 
  unfortunate that mr pickles sees things differently . 
  ukraine is n't ready for membership , but association is the first step . 
  the path to membership will give ukrainians a concrete reason to fight corruption -- europe has learned from the 2007 members to be more careful in that regard . 
  other than that , yes , all departments of the eu are tasked with olive oil distribution and produce classification ... & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  ja instead of yah and you would have fooled me . 
  well , almost no one today works on iter directly aside from construction workers , so i 'm doing something related , yes . 
  i hope the same thing you do . 
  though i think if other nations successfully and safely make use of this new source , germany & co. will follow suit . 
  the problem is that you are judging this technology to be unfit even though its budget shortfalls and delays are a purely political matter . 
  iter was thought of in the 1980s , but the political agreement was not reached until 20 years later . 
  the delays in construction come from the fact that contributions to iter are not in the form of cash , but in kind . 
  every party contributes certain components , which obviously is challenging because of diverging construction standards in every country . 
  internally the eu estimates it could have already built iter by itself for 60 % of the cost ( instead of the 45 % share it pays now ) if it would just go at it alone . 
  again , you are making this choice up . 
  there are national science budgets continuing to fund other projects . 
  it might just not be the eu . 
  as for your remark about total cumulative investments in renewables vs. fusion : that is simply not correct . 
  the world wide budgets of fusion research averaged over the last decades are around a billion usd a year , amounting to perhaps 50 billion usd since its inception . 
  it 's hard to find numbers for this for the entire world , but generally one can take the us expenditure and double them , i.e. 
  numbers from [ here ] ( http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles_2010/winter_2009/who_killed_fusion.pdf ) , page 17 . 
  in the meantime , renewable energy sources were already subsidised by [ more than that ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-09/renewable-energy-subsidies-worldwide-reached-57-billion-in-2009-iea-says.html ) every year in 2009 . 
  there is simply no to show that nuclear fusion has received as much funding as any other energy source . 
  finally , the performance of fusion research is [ developing exponentially ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zq3pyn6.jpeg ) , faster than even dynamic sectors like it . 
  below expectations is out of the question , unless you want to measure up to unfounded dreams of the 1950s , which originated in the media , not science . 
  i can use it all year long , obviously . 
  i do n't think germans have much of an opinion of him because he went right into the european parliament and never appeared on germany 's national stage . 
  ... but that 's the point . 
  no choice has to be made , unless you make one up . 
  fusion expenditure is a drop in the bucket , even when compared to contemporary renewable budgets . 
  even slashing it altogether for their benefit would not increase renewable support by any useful amount . 
  as i pointed out to you in another thread , even when only taking german numbers , the entire iter budget would only amount to an increase of renewable subsidies by 4 % ( 800m/20bn ) . 
  and for those measly 4 % * in germany alone * , you 'd have to scrap fusion research altogether . 
  it 's already running at a bare minimum ; iter was supposed to be thrice as large and was cut till scientists told politicians that any smaller will be useless . 
  so , anyone who `` induces '' such a choice does it wilfully to sabotage this specific technological branch , not to help any other branch . 
  all while especially in asia people are heavily investing in fusion because they do n't want just 20 % in 2100 as the european roadmap suggests . 
  perhaps there will be another sputnik moment . 
  i have a freezer on my balcony . 
  the graph you posted only includes r&d expenditure . 
  since renewables are already commercially exploitable , it is only natural that the state will not foot the ( entire ) bill . 
  except , he does through subsidies for installed renewables . 
  in 2007 , germany alone subsidised them with over 4 billion , i.e. 
  about twice the total * eu * r&d expenditure for that year , pushing total subsidies to [ over 100 billion euros ] ( http://www.shz.de/nachrichten/deutschland-welt/wirtschaft/buerger-muessen-fuer-energiewende-mehr-bezahlen-id3831596.html ) . 
  so , total fusion funding ( r&d ) has long been surpassed by total renewable funding ( r&d + operational subsidies ) , even just using german numbers for renewables . 
  fusion has taken into account the experiences from fission and can with quite some certainty say that its promises are not empty -- especially because , thanks to fission , people no longer believe everything easily and want to see evidence . 
  the fuel ( hydrogen isotopes ) is abundant ( hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe ) , the exhaust is a harmless noble gas ( helium , the second most abundant thing ) , the vessel materials have been optimised to resist activation so they can cool down within a few decades until ready for recycling , the process does n't involve a chain reaction that could get out of control , but the exact opposite . 
  so , fusion is , when we get down to it , quite literally the opposite of fission . 
  it should n't be lumped together . 
  so , once fusion is do-able , we control the ultimate power source , barring something like perhaps singularities . 
  its potential is basically limitless -- and this time this is not an empty promise but a rather clear goal . 
  renewables , on the other hand , suffer from their own drawbacks . 
  the unavoidable truth is that they are , at the moment , [ not able to power today 's dense populations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5bvbfwuq-q ) unless we are willing to remain dependent on rather unstable countries . 
  that truth will not go away for quite some time . 
  research into renewables will not easily ameliorate this situation ; renewable power generation , both solar and wind , are close to their theoretical optima . 
  big advances can only be expected for storage facilities , but that wo n't solve their power density issues . 
  that was perhaps what reagan and gorbachev had in mind when they agreed to the idea . 
  if you google the submission title , you will be able to read it . 
  be that as it may , you are lumping together fission and fusion , which really should n't be done . 
  um , that 's not correct . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/snidhd7.png ) , for example , you can see renewable subsidies in green . 
  in 2013 , germany subsidised them with over 19bn euros . 
  that 's all of iter 's costs , construction and operation in less than 2 years . 
  except iter is funded by basically the whole world . 
  you were doing fairly well , why did you have to put the last line in ? 
  jet is the european reactor , but there are several national ones . 
  europe really is ahead for now . 
  you 're probably thinking of ifmif . 
  recent results suggest that keeping the casing at around 400 degrees should allow indefinite operation because the material self-heals . 
  do n't look for a conspiracy when economics is good enough . 
  if fusion ca n't give us electricity below coal , oil or gas prices , people will continue using coal , oil or gas until it becomes more expensive than fusion . 
  that 's why one of the major goals of contemporary fusion research is to become more efficient and thus cheaper . 
  or else , we might get fusion working and still destroy the climate because it was simply too expensive to compete . 
  iter construction costs are eur16bn and about eur300m operation costs per year , i.e. 
  for 30 years of construction and operation ( 2010-2040 ) this amounts to eur830m per year .
