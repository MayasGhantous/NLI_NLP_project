  do we * really * have to look for money for other energy projects in these 830 millions when our combined economies have a gdp of 38 ' 000 ' 000 millions ? 
  it is , see for example [ numbers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sjh5r.jpg ) from america . 
  still , fusion is approaching its goal [ faster than for example computer chips ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zq3pyn6.jpeg ) . 
  unfortunately , a slow chip is already useful -- but fusion is only useful once its mastered . 
  i doubt his and * mine * are aligned , so i would n't hold my breath if i were you . 
  still , i like the direction . 
  it 's definitely a smart move to come forward with such a suggestion at this moment . 
  so , as i said , no one :d on a more serious note , if anything , alde will form something like a coalition with either the conservatives or labour to choose the new ec president . 
  they 'll never get their own candidate through . 
  i think the socialists really did themselves a great favour by choosing a lead candidate so early . 
  there 's no one there to oppose him . 
  fair enough . 
  parliament can ultimately dismiss the commission if they are really unhappy with their reaction . 
  um , i guess because that 's how it 's usually done , at least in europe . 
  parliaments can dismiss the prime minister/chancellor they elect ( i.e. 
  by extension his or her entire government ) , not his or her `` employees '' . 
  it permanently creates up-to-date evidence of how bad this `` newspaper '' is , which can then be used to convince people to disregard it . 
   however , the fact that the council and the european parliament can legislate `` only on the basis of a commission proposal '' [ 11 ] changes everything . 
  in other words , this provision makes it clear that the legislature is absolutely dependant on the executive and has no power to initiate legislation . 
  footnote 11 refers to art . 
  17 tfeu only , but art . 
  225 specifies that parliament can demand an initiative from the comission . 
  some meps that i 've talked to actually prefer it this way , because it means parliament does n't have to waste much time on proposals that wo n't even get a simple majority as a rough idea . 
  as for the rest , it 's unfortunate that the author subscribes to libertarian philosophy with a lax relationship to facts . 
  the alleged choice between federation and freedom is a false dichotomy ( corporations and foreign nations can infringe on an individual 's freedom as well and stopping that requires an own state of certain strength ) and the intention to ever closer union ( which is the european variant of `` more perfect union '' ) can also be found in the treaties and documents of european integration since its start . 
  ok , i see your point . 
  i think ultimately the blame in this scenario lays mostly with the people with the chequebooks , i.e. 
  who pay or do n't pay depending on whether they are satisfied with the debtor 's intentions . 
  the other parties are just middle-men . 
  the commission ca n't raise funds , the ecb is n't allowed to ( even though one could argue that they could have launched omt earlier ) , so that leaves the imf and the creditor nations . 
  at least the imf has been criticised in the past for the terms it imposes on needy countries . 
  as for the incomplete currency union : yes , you could blame that . 
  but what is such criticism good for ? 
  none of the people who came with it are in charge any more . 
  we have to deal with the consequences . 
  not sure how constructive it would be to point into the past . 
  umm , what decision ? 
  i 'm repeating myself , but energy and electricity are not the same thing . 
  well , i think this [ recent press release ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140110ipr32420/html/meps-anticipate-end-of-the-troika ) says it all . 
   there may therefore have been no alternative to the troika at that time , but `` we now have the funds and systems to control national budgets so we must get the system within the normal eu process '' he said . 
  the crisis handling was not part of regular eu procedures , i.e. 
  pretty much outside of parliament 's reach . 
  this will hopefully change in the future . 
  although , perhaps i am wrong . 
  if you can point me to something showing how parliament could have done something differently , i 'd happily concede . 
  how i wish i could show evidence without gaps of how strong governments coerced weaker ones . 
  but i ca n't . 
  intergovernmentalism happens behind closed doors , so i 'll have to rely on circumstantial evidence . 
  ( that alone is enough for me personally to be convinced that we should better move away from that system . ), 
  but there 's plenty of circumstantial evidence . 
  for example terrible cuts to essential public services like health or education . 
  all done with the tacit approval of the creditor governments/the troika . 
  now , one might counter by saying that the debtor governments did n't have to agree to such austerity -- cut some other things , hunt down the tax evaders , or any other thing that makes more sense but probably takes longer , or just not take the money at all and do whatever they want -- but that 's not really true . 
  without receiving the loans on time , they would have defaulted , with unforeseeable but very likely catastrophic consequences . 
  in the end , i see misery in the periphery while my own country and the likes of it loan out money to them making a nice profit due to low interest rates on their own bonds . 
  either way , schulz and his parliament had no place in any of this so , to stay on topic , they should n't be blamed for any of this . 
   if the commissioners could be dismissed by parliament then maybe they would think twice before enacting harsh measures that cripple member states . 
  [ they can be dismissed ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00b9de8689/oversight-and-control-functions.html ) . 
  wo n't really help , though : the community institutions , aside from the ecb , which has a very narrow mandate , are all but toothless . 
  strong governments make the rules at the expense of weaker ones . 
  intergovernmentalism is the problem . 
  is n't this exactly what schulz decried , especially about the uk ? 
  his institution , parliament , has all but been ignored during the past years . 
  it 's unfair to count him as part of the system when he and his institution are part of said system in name only . 
  do [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vd0vk/bulgaria_freaks_poisoned_the_cat_of_a_blind_lady/cerbe0w ) , dude . 
  we do n't speak bulgarian , so it 's in your hands . 
  if i have to choose , let 's got with euromillions . 
  currently at $ 32m , i could live with that . 
  no , why would i care ? 
  can i have the lottery numbers for next week , please ?

   it is never going to join the euro . 
  can you look something up for me in that crystal ball of yours ? 
  the reason why perhaps no business has moved away from britain because it 's not in the euro is because being outside of the euro as a country by itself does n't necessarily put you at a formal disadvantage , aside from exchange rate risk when trying to establish cross-border supply chains . 
  so far britain has successfully prevented the eurozone from putting non-eurozone countries at such a formal disadvantage . 
  for instance , euro denominated business does n't have to take place in the eurozone -- so far . 
  there are no guarantees that reu wo n't do just that without the uk 's weight to stop it . 
  the same goes for the other perks of membership . 
  it 's very well possible that a ( protectionist leaning ) country like for example france might prevent easy access to the common market for britain . 
  perhaps even out of spite . 
  it does n't even have to be done openly ... just delay the negotiations after the referendum long enough . 
  \\* shrugs \\* he can propose stuff all day long . 
  he ca n't decide what makes it past the proposal stage . 
  not sure how this constitutes power . 
  perhaps you can explain more ? 
   i 'm wondering , what are your thoughts on this statement ? 
  europe will either work on its cohesion , or it will lose whatever sovereignty it has left to the existing and emerging superpowers . 
  it will suffer exactly the same fate that pre-unification germany suffered . 
  we already see this today with certain nations quite firmly under america 's hegemony and others under russia 's . 
  at the same time we see [ china claiming its part of the continent ] ( http://ecfr.eu/content/entry/commentary_why_europe_cant_leave_asia_to_the_us237 ) . 
  this trajectory can hardly be disputed . 
  sure , the severity can be debated , but in general there is no strong argument to refute it altogether . 
  as long as the european elites do not convince their peoples of this , they might really not be in favour of a kind of federal europe . 
  that said , going [ from these poll numbers ] ( http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1153-is-there-a-path-to-political-union/ ) , many of them are also do n't appear to be in favour of their own existing countries . 
  so , they 're probably indifferent , but it might still cost the politicians who are in office during federalisation very dearly . 
  the first obstacle is probably that we 're all using phrases like `` united states of europe '' or `` federal europe '' without actually talking about what we mean with them . 
  opponents might see an ultra-centralised state , federal in name only . 
  proponents might see a truly federal construct with strong states that retain their national cultures and sovereignty over many policy areas . 
  unless we agree on one idea , we 'll never have a useful debate .
