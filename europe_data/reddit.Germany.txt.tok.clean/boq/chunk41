  ---------------------------- this is also why i dislike how farage displays the situation . 
  for instance , greece had two choices : default and leave the euro and then be ultimately constrained by the markets or keep the euro and make concessions to their european partners . 
  either way , greece could n't exercise full sovereignty . 
  that 's what happens when you end up in too much debt . 
  at the end of the day , why that happened is really not that important . 
  i 'd wager external devaluation would not have been much more pleasant than internal devaluation . 
  or his enumeration of `` big business , big banks and in the shape of mr barroso , big bureaucrats . '', 
  what power does barroso have , exactly ? 
  [ almost none ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:eu_competences ) , at least none that is relevant to the current situation . 
  big business , big banks , that 's a whole new ball game . 
  but what does it have to do with europe ? 
  farage is a demagogue , spewing inflammatory speeches with little amounts of substance behind them . 
  it 's unfortunate that so many fall for his lines . 
  seriously . 
  this is among the worst bro-maths i ever saw . 
  kudos for confronting djmedic , i started writing a response but [ gave up half-way through ] ( http://gifatron.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/seinfeld_no_thanks.gif ) . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  interesting . 
  is labour the same with regard to rebellion ? 
  traditionally i associate left-of-centre parties more with in-fighting than right-of-centre ones . 
  well , yes and no . 
  it 's hard to quickly ramp nuclear up and down with current power plant designs . 
  thus , to accommodate a growing number of renewables without sufficient and appropriate storage and/or a powerful grid , you need gas as a backup . 
  that said , i 'm betting the long term energy mix in europe will be nuclear and renewables ( mostly wind because of its comparably short correlation length ) connected through a powerful continental grid to move renwable power from producers to consumers , regardless of time and location . 
  while i 'm no big fan of fracking , gas is currently our best bet . 
  it is waaaaay cleaner than coal or oil . 
  but it is also not intermittent like renewables and well within our technological grasp . 
  if we could replace all of our dirty power plants with gas , we 'd be quite a bit closer to totally clean . 
  there is no better alternative at the moment than gas aside from perhaps nuclear . 
  that said , if we want to go this way , i think it is not fair to unload the environmental damage of gas extraction on other countries , so i 'd be open for it in europe if we ca n't agree on better clean alternative . 
  or as a german saying goes : you have to die one death . 
  we 're talking about asylum seekers , coming from a country that is suffering from a civil war . 
  you 'd want someone to extend a helping hand when you were in such a position , would n't you . 
   immigrant children of low socioeconomic status lead the crime statistics pretty much everywhere in europe yes , but the primary keywords are `` low socioeconomic status '' , not `` immigrant '' . 
  we need to improve the conditions for people of low socioeconomic status , native or not . 
  then we 'll tackle these issues . 
  you misunderstand . 
  * i * want to buy french electricity ... at french * prices * ;-), 
  i support complete liberalisation of the european electricity market . 
  let me buy from edf . 
  [ i want in on that sweet french nuke electricity ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gafzale.gif ) . 
  you 're right . 
  i can barely walk home without being harassed , beaten and robbed by sunni women with small children . 
  there have been some remarks from german conservative politicians in the last weeks , but i do n't think the dominant narrative is on their side -- provided that i gauge the media accurately . 
  i wish . 
  germans do the same and then pat themselves on the back how they beat the evil energy corporations . 
  why are you writing `` energy '' when the article writes `` electricity '' ? 
  they are not interchangeable and it gives a false sense of accomplishment . 
  since only about 16 % of denmark 's total primary energy consumption end up in electrical form , 57.4 % quickly turn into ~ 9 % :-(, 
  without a reference to national approval similar to [ this ] ( http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1153-is-there-a-path-to-political-union/ ) , this poll is not very useful . 
  israel already knows the world does n't agree with the settlements , it will show them nothing new . 
  however , the settlements employ a lot of palestinians that would suffer from losing their jobs . 
  this will hurt exactly those that we want and should help . 
  stop looking for a conspirator . 
  it was simply market failure to price all eurozone bonds the same way and at some point actors on the market realised their mistake and the subsequent correction was snowballing and thus abrupt . 
  the market should n't have offered such cheap loans and the governments in question should not have taken them . 
  facts are n't subject to cultural differences . 
  sir , we ca n't penetrate a reality distortion field of that magnitude !, 
  but reddit comes from `` i have * read it * . '', 
  no re-editing or anything . 
  i know that amelia andersdotter always tries to talk other meps into her viewpoint so contacting your other meps and talking to them will definitely make her job easier . 
  i 'm very sad that pp.se did not nominate her for # 1 in the upcoming election :-(, 
  it 's up to you whether you want to contact * your * m ( e ) p or hope that they do what you want by themselves . 
  but you can be sure that lobbies ** will ** contact them to get them to do their bidding . 
  really ? 
  what errors ? 
  i thought i was an expert on the netherlands now :-|, 
  same day as gibraltar 's chief minister 's election . 
  my story is similar , but without the classroom , i doubt we would have had the necessary basis to watch or read anything in english . 
  there is no technicality . 
  the treaty is solely about sovereign debt , i.e. 
  public debt . 
  [ read it yourself if you do n't believe me ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/consolidated_version_of_the_treaty_on_the_functioning_of_the_european_union/title_viii:_economic_and_monetary_policy#article_125 ) . 
  target2 simply reflects capital flow within the eurozone . 
  the treaties only concern lending to states , not internal balances of the central banks within the european system of central banks . 
  while i do n't like that part of dublin ii and would like it changed , italy had no right to give the asylum seekers visas . 
  they were n't `` legal migrants . '', 
  target2 simply reflects capital movements within the eurozone , not lending . 
  and , since the euro is not an optimal currency area , countries should work to improve it . 
  there is no issue with target2 . 
  the balances are of a completely academic nature as long as no one leaves the euro . 
   not to mention that germany had a hard time under the early euro years which led to painful social reforms among other things . 
  germany had a hard time for years before that already . 
  it 's only that the schr\u00f6der government was the one to address it . 
  the coinciding euro introduction is just that , a coincidence . 
  inflation is * literally * the prices rising because when your money loses value , you need more of it to pay for stuff . 
  germans are afraid of many things , inflation is just one of them . 
  https://www.comviq.se/eu-eng ... but i doubt it 's just 10 % . 
  well , it takes two to tango . 
  any chance you could send a foi request to someone else to obtain a copy ? 
  perhaps by asking the independent ( the newspaper behind that link ) ? 
  may i ask what your age is ? 
  it gets the poles who work in britain for nice wages while paying taxes without having to pay for an entire family 's education , healthcare and so on . 
  ( because that was an italian colony maybe ? ), 
  is this a thing anywhere in europe or just in america ? 
  thanks , these are very nice . 
  but still significantly more expensive than what the eu is already enforcing or will be enforcing in the near future . 
  therefore not really useful for europeans who just pop over the border casually , because it ca n't replace regular phone carriers . 
  yes , except if you are european/swiss , then no questions asked . 
  be that as it may , the german nationality law states that eu ( and swiss ) citizens do n't have to renounce their old citizenship .
