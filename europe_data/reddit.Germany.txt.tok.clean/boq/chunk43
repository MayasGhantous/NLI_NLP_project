  there , see all the u 's ? ), 
  well , it 's not just germany and britain though . 
  most countries have a system of checks and balances in place that limits parliament 's power ( every branch 's power actually ) with regard to a written constitution . 
  britain and a few other places do n't parliament could , for example , slowly cut away privacy rights and no one would be there to stop it . 
  civil society has been famously unable to do so , everywhere . 
  but this is not about who do i trust more . 
  abuses of power happen when government/parliament * do * something . 
  the courts limit the ability of government/parliament to do something ; but they themselves can not do anything except interpret existing legislation . 
  if my trust in the courts is misplaced , what will happen is simply that parliament wo n't have any formal limits . 
  i do n't see how this is equivalent to the british status quo , it goes beyond that . 
  so yeah , what you described as `` evolved gradually '' feels a bit like `` democracy beta . '', 
  perhaps it [ does need an update in the form of a written constitution ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/david-allen-green/2013/11/12/does-the-united-kingdom-need-a-written-constitution/ ) . 
  but , that 's not my beer , as we say in german . 
  considering that many other countries have all the `` checks '' you mentioned as well , and yet regularly laws are struck down by courts there , this explanation just makes me uncomfortable . 
  did n't call anyone a liar or asshole . 
  0/10 would not upvote, 
  are you parodying another user with a swedish flag , my balkan friend ? 
  the right wing has no objections towards the hra ? 
  is n't this statement completely academic when parliament can do whatever it wants without any checks ? 
  centrists and left wingers do that ? 
  what does the right wing do then ? 
  i 'd eat a wei\u00dfwurst if it was n't after noon . 
  ... are n't you , in reality , portuguese or something ? 
  because that makes your comment fairly confusing . 
  obviously your advice about fresh ones applies to mine as well . 
  i 'd send you some but i think that 'd violate a number of health codes and probably poison you once you get them . 
  except flags can be misleading ... 
  i 'm originally romanian and i know my mititei and chiftele and sarmale and what have you . 
  i 'll try that when i have the chance , even though i doubt it can compete with the grilled deliciousness of mititei . 
  the fat in the milk carries the flavour , not dilute it . 
  i put milk in my tea whenever i can . 
  i know , but chiftele are boring . 
  once you 've tried explaining christmas to some asians you start appreciating europe 's cultural heterogeneity , which culminates somewhere around the different ways of preparing meatballs . 
  obviously the right way is the [ romanian way ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mititei ) . 
  itt : germans complaining about a german-language post while being opposed by non-germans who do n't mind some non-english content . 
  dogs and cats , living together !, 
  what you should decry is the culture of instant gratification . 
  so you protested , big deal . 
  that took a day of your life or what ? 
  if you really care about something that no one else stands for , get in the democratic ring : run for office , for example . 
  the way things are is ingrained in the system and its stakeholders . 
  as long as you 're just outside looking in , you wo n't be very influential in altering the system 's course . 
  a protest is just a minor inconvenience for those inside , unless it becomes big enough to topple the state -- but do you really think we need that ? 
  we 're complaining on a pretty high level . 
  interesting . 
  how did they justify that ? 
  i can assure you , the average german ca n't even tell what slavic language he 's hearing . 
   economic activity per capita vs  only there because it has a small population, 
  do n't you do that in the uk , too ? 
  in germany , if you break out of prison without causing any damage to anything or anyone , there wo n't be an extra charge either . 
  why are you not showing me what i asked ? 
  are you afraid there are regions in sweden continuously receiving money and never becoming net payers ? 
  which would undermine your argument ? 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i said ** i ** ca n't explain it and that 's * all * i said . 
  the eu budget website already gives a passable overview over the entire budget , with hundreds of pages of [ publications ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/biblio/publications/publications_en.cfm ) available . 
  for more detail about cohesion policy you can try starting with a book like [ this ] ( http://books.google.de/books?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;id=yzmcaqaaqbaj&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=pa229&amp;dq=cohesion+policy+benefits&amp;ots=r5z8pik4nk&amp;sig=_nxgrgw1i-cbnflmgfw_qxs8hpg#v=onepage&amp;q=cohesion%20policy%20benefits&amp;f=false ) or go ask your meps for further information . 
  i agree that it would be better if such information was publicly available and easy to be found but intergovernmental circles like the council are not known for their transparency . 
  that 's why more power should rest with the parliament and not behind the closed doors of the council . 
  last but not least i would like to ask you another time to point me to the financial data for the swedish counties . 
  will you please help me find them ? 
  the point is , it is a very complex matter to explain why certain regions do well economically and others do n't . 
  this goes beyond what i can do in a reddit comment . 
  that does n't mean it ca n't be done , just that i ca n't do it here and now . 
  one could certainly write dissertations about such a topic . 
  i can , however , show that the same circumstances exist everywhere : there are regions constantly receiving more than they pay back in any country , including mine or yours . 
  [ here ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a4nderfinanzausgleich#finanzvolumen ) , for example , is the data for germany . 
  you can see how states like lower saxony ( niedersachsen ) receive more than they give continuously . 
  it 's really a mathematical constraint ; perfect equilibrium between different places can not be achieved and sometimes it 's not worth trying to achieve it or even possible at all . 
  if you would please take a look and find the appropriate data for sweden , you 'll see definitely similar stats . 
  and yet , you/we do n't cut up our countries to kick out the alleged unproductive parts and only keep the rich ones . 
  there is a value in preserving the whole , even if parts are continuously at a deficit . 
  i think blanket limits on duration are not appropriate . 
  one has to take into account the specific situation of every country . 
  all you write is that it 's been long enough . 
  this is not a proper analysis . 
  but again , could you please point me to some statistics about finances within sweden and its counties ? 
  i 'll do fine once i have them in front of me , just finding them seems to be beyond me . 
  can you maybe help me ? 
  my swedish is n't good enough . 
  can you show me a graph of net paying/receiving regions in sweden over time ? 
  just to understand your viewpoint . 
  sigh . 
  greece 's [ time as a net recipient is coming to an end ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/countrychart.ashx?country=el&amp;method=gdp ) , you know . 
  where have i lied ? 
  point me to one instance and i will concede . 
  i did n't mean to dismiss the process . 
  my point was that public opinion is not some naturally correct opinion that is formed within individual and isolated citizens . 
  it is , at least with more complex issues like monetary policy , in large parts crafted by politicians and the media . 
  so when someone argues that population xyz does n't want something , it is n't necessarily because that would be bad for xyz ( , or even that xyz has an * informed * opinion about the issue ) , but simply because xyz 's elite has convinced them of that . 
  it is fundamentally only an argumentum ad populum , i.e. 
  in the context of a discussion an argument of fairly low quality , regardless of the fact that our system of government builds on it . 
  and in every country 's case , there are a lot of unelected bureaucrats behind it . 
  after all , as any public servant will tell you , politicians come and go , but they stay . 
  if anything , brussels ' bureaucrats are more under scrutiny because 28 governments perceive it/them as a foreign threat . 
  so , who has the interests of the british people at heart ? 
  no one . 
  just like no one has the interests of the german or french people at heart . 
  they are far too diverse to have one set of interests . 
  i 'd wager class is much more a divider than nationality and the same classes across europe are closer to each other than the differing passports might suggest .
