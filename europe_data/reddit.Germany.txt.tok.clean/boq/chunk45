  euro crisis ; that 's a wholly intergovernmental affair ) . 
  and , of course , they make up things altogether as well . 
  both politicians and [ media hand in hand ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/ ) . 
  they shape public opinion to be the way it is . 
  * that 's * why it is how it is . 
  you 'll lie in the bed you make . 
  from what i can tell , the uk 's elites , however , do n't really seem to have the british people 's interests at heart , so i 'd wager it wo n't be as comfortable as some suggest . 
  as for denmark and sweden : pressure to opt-in will obviously mount with the biggest opt-out ` er out of the union . 
  exceptions create more overhead . 
  it gets harder to justify it for fewer people . 
  will they cave , will the exceptions continue , will they leave ? 
  i do n't know . 
  \\* just to be clear : other countries ' politicians do the same , even if they might not be quite as successful with it . 
  will you bet with me , for a beer , that the uk will not leave the union ? 
  `` britain . '', 
  i can see how average britons will prosper once things like the working time directive are abolished or produce is classified according to national instead of community standards . 
  no , not a threat . 
  a simple assertion . 
  the council has already made it clear that switzerland will not get any more bilateral treaties for single market issues like it has in the past . 
  so i 'd say the uk wo n't either . 
  the arrangement will be , if anything , like the eea . 
  this is ridiculous , how the fuck are you getting upvoted ? 
  this is a textbook example of straw-man reasoning . 
  first , you insinuate i deemed these things irrelevant , then you reiterate how relevant these things are . 
  but , ok , let me humour you . 
   how can it not be relevant that the uk is one of the best at implementing laws et al , and greece is n't ? 
  let 's [ take a look ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/docs/docs_infringements/annual_report_30/com_2013_726_en.pdf ) . 
  there were 13 late transposition infringements open as of last december for greece , and 25 for the uk . 
  uh , not quite what you wrote , is it ? 
  but yes , greece has more total open infringement cases ; they 're on place 5 . 
  the uk , much better , is on place 8 . 
  not quite one of the best , eh ? 
   how can it not be relevant that instead of arguing against permanent bet recipients that are draining the recourses , you are ranting against one of the few triple a members still left ? 
  the uk 's ppp-gdp/capita is 10 % lower than the dutch one , but their contribution to the eu budgets is 30 % lower . 
  they are not pulling their weight . 
  besides , being triple a has no tangible meaning for the european project itself , it just means you wo n't default on your debts . 
  ( you 'll just cheat your way out of debts with qe and inflation , which is a-ok . ) that said , i 'm also arguing for reforms in the net recipients . 
  at the moment , we not only make profits off the loans we gave them but also can observe how painful the reforms are for them . 
  you know , for someone from the supposed home of social democracy you sound decidedly un-social . 
   how can it not be relevant that the eurozone are arguing with the uk about stuff that is far outside the treaties and has to be implemented just because the eurozone , not the uk fucked up , like the bank union and ftt ? 
  that 's a good question . 
  why * are * we arguing with the uk ? 
  oh right , because the uk government wants to stick its nose in eurozone business , afraid that deepened integration will erode what little influence they have left after dragging their feet as much as they have . 
   why is the eurozone the blueprint of success . 
  should n't you be a success then ? 
  some eurozone countries are doing well , some are n't . 
  just like the situation outside the eurozone . 
   why are n't you concerned about permanent drainage , not working cohesion funds etc. ? 
  they are not `` not working . '', 
  some things just need time . 
  however , i like to keep things in perspective . 
  for every tax euro , less than a cent goes into the eu 's coffers and of that cent a substantial part returns to the contributor states anyway . 
  so , because i like to spend my concern in relation to the cause for concern , wasted eu funds will certainly not get more than a fraction of a per cent of my concern . 
  the uk is not switzerland , it wo n't magically become switzerland , and it will definitely not be treated like switzerland . 
  it tried to be like switzerland before it joined , but it could n't . 
  it 's more toxic for you than for us . 
  i think continued integration is a core tenet of the union ( `` ever closer union '' ) . 
  its rejection amounts to a rejection of the whole in my eyes . 
  this is not supposed to just be a free trade area . 
  as for the return of powers to the member states , perhaps some countries would do good to review their own legislation instead of blaming the union . 
  the eu has [ very few exclusive powers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:eu_competences ) . 
  what 's with all the drivel ? 
  i never mentioned the things you are arguing against . 
  how about asking what i mean before going on a pointless rant ? 
  look at [ this table ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#table ) and tell me the uk government is n't trying to cherrypick membership . 
  the only other country with as much red is denmark , though they probably would n't get away with it if it were n't for the uk . 
  the `` unofficial '' but constant blaming of many problems on the eu and the repeated misrepresentation of facts is more toxic . 
  britain questions european integration as such . 
  it 's a whole different kind of disagreement than the other ones you listed . 
  britain seem to reject the whole system , not just fight for some details within the system . 
   i do n't see why galileo does n't just have two frequencies of equal accuracy , one that can be blocked off ( global access ) and one that could be used only by a theoretical future eu military . 
  [ maybe it has ? 
  ] ( http://www.thegloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/steve-urkel-side-eye-umm-no.gif ), 
   do n't give a shit about you when the hard times come i think that really is n't true . 
  but , how exactly would you like the rest ` to give a shit ? ',

   conversely i always ask my `` ethnic romanian '' friends what makes a gypsy a gypsy ? 
  if a gypsy moves to the city , wears a suit , works 9-5 and abides the law , is he still a gypsy ? 
  please continue doing this . 
  i like seeing my romanian family squirm when they try to talk their way out of it . 
  the word you are looking for is `` polemic . '', 
  you 're right . 
  but , like everyone else , we sometimes like being outraged . 
  do n't take it personally . 
  sovereign nations classifying their produce according to their national cultures is the pinnacle of democracy !, 
  i 'm aware of that , but i was thinking of [ * contemporary * usage of this phrase across the pond ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/states%27_rights ) . 
  if you really believe that i was likening rejection of eu food aid to slavery , you are out of your mind . 
  i did n't make a comparison . 
  you 're projecting things . 
  many people do n't understand the concept of averaging ? 
  no idea . 
  `` states ' rights !! '', 
  i remember that from somewhere . 
  :-) no , but seriously . 
  at the moment , europe combines both somewhat adequate funding and know-how . 
  every other places seems to either lack the money or the know-how . 
  that 's why we ca n't rest on our laurels . 
  not really . 
  he3 fusion is even harder than d-t fusion . 
  we are .
