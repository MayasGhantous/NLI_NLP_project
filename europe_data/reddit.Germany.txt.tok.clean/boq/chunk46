   panzer ** k ** orps ( also not very useful in that scenario . ), 
  i do n't know . 
  i think the spanish and italians have some . 
  the conflict is a major source for instability in the mena area , constantly putting grist on muslim extremists ' mills , further driving people to flee their home countries . 
  yes , but that 's because right-wingers are people , not because people generally behave like right-wingers . 
  tabloids have huge readerships . 
  if we do n't confront them , they 'll reign unhindered . 
  iskander is the arab/persian version of ` alexander . ', 
  if the network was simply reporting on him , neutrally , you 'd be right . 
  but they 're not . 
  they 're paying him to do this show so they can profit off it . 
  they are not neutral . 
  unless they explicitly make it clear that they are not okay with it , by continuing to pay him and let him use the infrastructure of rtl , they are giving their consent to his escapades . 
  they are not just enablers of his behaviour , they even profit from it .

  quas4r did n't say ` over your country . ', 
  allowing things like mass murder when we could prevent it * is * letting the perpetrators walk all over us and our values and interests . 
  europeans are prepared to have a ground war in their countries or close to them , so we have a larger combined army , at least when going by troop numbers . 
  no way , are you telling me right-wingers are ` enhancing ' stats to make a point ? 
  ... they 're the same pack * everywhere * . 
  no , they do n't . 
  * the state * will not come after you . 
  but if your employer does n't come after you , he implicitly condones your behaviour or at least seems not to have a problem with . 
  [ perhaps a solution ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1s2jpv/the_lies_behind_this_transatlantic_trade_deal/cdu48no?context=3 ), 
  european air forces and navies often/usually work together anyway , be it for short-lived interventions in africa or longer missions like atalanta . 
  since these missions are generally not very risky or in need of many troops ( as opposed to the army ) , collectivisation of air forces and navies is probably not unthinkable . 
  it would also be very smart since these branches are very capital intensive and , as we 've seen in libya , not exactly very effective at the moment . 
  housing bubbles do n't make a nation competitive . 
  countries where credit is too cheap can and need to redirect the credit away from unsustainable and generally useless bubbles . 
  investments in other areas will not only be more beneficial in the long run but also counteract boom and bust cycles . 
  i 've been politically active for years . 
  i 've seen teenagers that were better suited for such a position than pensioners . 
  age is a very poor indicator of capability . 
  so ... why not introduce a similar rule instead of 100 questions or questioning freedom of movement as a whole ? 
  this is all confusing . 
  cheaper and more fish for us \\ o /, 
  the entire eu plus norway and iceland happens to be ... [ the eea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area ) . 
  so i 'd wager it has something to do with that . 
  just leech benefits like all the foreigners . 
  55 $ is [ a comparable german all-net flat ] ( http://www.congstar.de/allnet-flat-l/ ) +15 $ . 
  both libya and yugoslavia are on our doorsteps . 
  when we decide to act there , we should n't have to depend on uncle sam to do so . 
  why america got involved or why we got involved is secondary . 
  the point is that is was right next to us , so we did n't need any force projection capability , and yet we sucked at it . 
  i mean , european planes faces ammunition shortages against libya . 
  * ammunition shortages !, 
  * and you are right . 
  america does n't do us favours . 
  we paid or will pay for that support . 
  [ eu military expenditure is pretty much exactly 1/2 of us military expenditure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_of_the_european_union#european_military_expenditure ) . 
  so i agree with / u/vestrati : we should combine at least our air forces and navies to either retain our current capabilities and save money or keep the same expenditure and increase capabilities . 
  you have to work in germany at least so much that you or your german employer pays into the social systems once . 
  then your work in the uk can be added on top of that to increase your entitlement . 
  in germany you first receive `` unemployment money '' ( ~ 2/3 of your last salary ) for up to 12 months if you worked for more than 24 months before you applied for it ( shorter if you worked less ) . 
  your work in the uk could count towards that if , as i said , you worked a little bit in germany before applying for benefits . 
  after your `` unemployment money '' runs out , you get `` unemployment money ii '' if you do n't have noteworthy savings . 
  average unemployment money ii for singles is around $ 700/month ( including housing benefits and other special benefits ) . 
  that 's complicated , i had to look up the current laws . 
  apparently you have to be in germany for a minimum of three months before you can get * anything * . 
  after three months you can apply for benefits . 
  if you have n't worked before you applied , germany * can * expel you . 
  if you did work and pay taxes , even just for a short time , you are entitled to all social benefits as other germans after said three months ( though benefits were cut 10 years ago for all germans , so it 's not as juicy as some people might think ) . 
  there are no language tests . 
  currently there are some court cases pending : in the state of north-rhine westphalia , the social court says people are entitled right from their arrival in germany , the social court in lower saxony said the three months have to be respected . 
  the federal social court has referred the case to the european court of justice to get an opinion on the european directive that is the basis for this legislation . 
  off the top of my head i remember that we needed american help in yugoslavia and in libya . 
  both pretty pathetic opponents , if you think about it . 
  why are you letting ireland & co. off the hook that easily ? 
  monetary policy is n't the only way to counter cheap credit . 
  why did n't the countries that joined the euro evade bubbles by , for example , raising taxes on risky sectors to slow down their growth ? 
  they knew that the only criterion for the interest rates is price stability . 
  it 's unfair to put the blame on one side alone . 
  i did n't say we need them . 
  i just pointed out that our militaries suck when you put in them in relation to their cost . 
  hm , our interior minister 's remarks were published but they did n't even make front page . 
  he regularly comes up with ideas that go nowhere . 
  but thank you for the link . 
  in the comments someone linked to [ this ] ( http://eu-rope.ideasoneurope.eu/2013/12/05/the-free-movement-of-people/ ) . 
  is that really true ? 
  did as many britons leave britain as reuropeans moved to britain ? 
  perhaps have your government levy taxes on property sales to make them less attractive ? 
  or something , i do n't know . 
  can someone more knowledgeable sum up why the uk is debating this topic now and , say , germany does n't ? 
  why is this such a big deal * now * and why apparently only * there * ? 
  you 're right . 
  we spend between 1/2 -2 / 3 of what you guys spend and look at what we get for that ... hint : we do n't have 1/2 -2 / 3 of 11 supercarriers patrolling the world 's oceans . 
  what can i say ? 
  the protocol allows it , so it 'll probably happen eventually if bitcoin does become more popular . 
  bitcoin is only pseudonymous . 
  no-one should give in to the illusions of anonymity , or they 'll have a bad day eventually . 
  next thing you 'll tell me obama is n't literally stalin . 
  as i pointed out , all this can be prevented with an appropriate infrastructure in place that allows honest nodes to stop fraudulent activity . 
  we are in the wild west phase now . 
  the infrastructure is n't there yet . 
  but it 'll be there in time . 
  money laundering is already illegal . 
  it will be enforced , i 'm sure . 
  if the cops tell me that i received a transaction from an account that was receiving hacked coins , i will reveal the identity of the amazon vendor and go on with my day . 
  police will go after him and so on till they find the original perpetrator .
