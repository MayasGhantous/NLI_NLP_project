  it 's good that they included this subject as well . 
  edit : [ this site ] ( http://action.ffii.org/acta/lisbon ) claims that agreement by the members was n't needed at all . 
  you can vote in spain . 
  do n't know if they offer absentee ballot , you 'll have to check with your local authorities . 
  you 'll be voting for a list of candidates nominated in spain . 
  currently there are only national lists , though pan-european lists are under discussion . 
  some users here believe that they will be downvoted based on their flag and thus change it to something else . 
  paranoia if you ask me . 
  this is really interesting . 
  all in all , meps tend to vote like the users of the site . 
  that 's a good sign . 
  ukip can not accomplish its goals at the ep . 
  why are you sending them there ? 
  you will have no meaningful representation . 
   absolutely no right of initiative that 's not entirely correct . 
  parliament can vote to demand a draft from the commission , which they can then modify . 
  ummm ... 
  your first link shows olive oil producers want to keep their subsidies . 
  does n't suprise me . 
  but the second link states that cap payments primarily go to northern countries ( 86 % of total payment , page 18 ) . 
  not sure what you want to show me with that with regards to southern subsidies . 
  even if you deviate from the papers definition and count ireland to the north and all of france and italy to the south , the ratio becomes about 50:50 , it certainly does n't reverse . 
  your third link shows a wide coalition of opponents against sugar quotas . 
  ( i 'm one of them  ) . 
  so i do n't know why this is a sweden vs. rest issue ? 
  the industries in question might be in other countries , but they oppose liberalisation because they are these industries , not because they are in these countries . 
  but , opposition mounts , it wo n't be for long . 
  the fourth link sounds good . 
  [ apparently ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_agricultural_policy#the_cap_today ) quite a few of his suggestions were implemented . 
  altogether the relative size of the cap budget has shrunk to almost a half of what it was 30 years ago . 
  i think it 's on the right track . 
  as for the rest of your post , as you can see in your second link , originally subsidies certainly ** did n't ** go to the south . 
  they also do n't refuse to reform , seeing as quite a bit has changed over the years . 
  you have to understand , though , that other countries ' economies are more dependent on agriculture and will thus be more conservative when it comes to making big changes to that sector . 
  as for your taxes : yes , you do pay more . 
  but you also get back much more . 
  you should move to the south for a while to experience the lower living standard/level of social services if you think they are resting on your tax kronor . 
  why ? 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sm58n/2_french_soldiers_killed_in_the_central_african/cdz1b2h  it depends where you intervene , and how . 
   in both mali and the central african republic , france intervened , or intervenes , at the request of the official government of these countries , to the cheers of most of the population , with the approval of most if not all sovereign nations , with a limited amount of soldiers and with a clear objective that the african union armies should take over in the peace process as quickly as possible once the main threats are destroyed . 
    iraq and afghanistan were a whole different deal as , for example , americans and its allies were rather perceived as conquerors invading and occupying a sovereign nation . 
  llanita 's relationship to facts is , shall we say , complicated . 
  so it 's banned in especially vulnerable areas as defined by the commission ? 
  if yes , at least something ... 
  the big questions is ... who the fuck is downvoting everything ? 
  whenever this comes up , everyone agrees that it 's not okay . 
  do we have an army of downvoting lurkers around ? 
  for real . 
  greeks suck at marketing . 
  glad to hear it 's getting better . 
  well , if you find more to read in english , i 'd be very happy . 
  i really want to know more . 
  perhaps also about the proposed reforms that the south allegedly votes down permanently ? 
  thank you , in any case . 
  actually they have to follow most of the rules . 
  anyway . 
  can you point me to some more reading ? 
  what did you have before ? 
  how are you discriminated against ? 
  ( and why do you sound so angry ? 
  44 % of the eu budget only make less than 0.4 % of total government spending in the eu . 
  that really is n't worth being so angry . 
  sorry if i 'm misinterpreting your tone ... ), 
  first of all , thank you for being so open about this . 
  being as na\u00efve as i am , i 'm hoping the commission will protect the technologies through patents but keep them generally available to everyone through licensing . 
  perhaps with a progressive licensing fee , i.e. 
  small businesses pay nothing or very little and big successful businesses contribute more . 
  that should perhaps ensure the best climate for innovation while at the same time allowing us to recoup the costs for everything . 
  do you think that would be a good idea and/or possible ? 
  this sounds interesting . 
  what does `` satellite technology intellectual property '' mean here exactly ? 
   as for gain in other areas - well , norway and switserland are surviving fairly well , and they do n't have to sponsor the idiotic cap . 
  actually , both switzerland and norway have the pleasure of paying around $ 60 per year and capita to the eu . 
  that 's 2/3 of what other net-payers cough up , but then again neither norway nor switzerland get an equal seat at the table where the rules are made . 
  wait . 
  member states would rather have our infrastructure rely on foreign satellite systems ? 
  why ? 
  why is the parliament a farce ? 
  it can dissolve the commission . 
  and the accounts are , to repeat myself once again , not signed off because some of them are under national jurisdiction . 
  [ the house of lords has found no evidence of heightened amounts of corruption ] ( http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldeucom/270/27010.htm ) . 
  and van rompuy is the president of the * council * . 
  the members of the council , our governments , made him ** their ** chief clerk . 
  now he gets to organise council meetings . 
  wow , such power . 
  not with that attitude , no . 
  unelected , undemocratic , unaccountable , all the buzzwords are there . 
  who exactly are you referring to ? 
  parliament , which we elect directly ? 
  the commission , that is appointed by our collective governments and confirmed by parliament ? 
  the council , which * is * our national governments ? 
  but the eu institutions do n't have the powers necessary for such a new deal . 
  i 'm willing to give it such powers , are you ? 
  maybe we have different definitions of the word create . 
  so let 's get this straight : do you believe that the ec can think up a bill and turn it into the law of the land all by itself ? 
  first of all , when did opinions and facts become interchangeable ? 
  oh right , never . 
  your posts are factually incorrect and thus add nothing to the discussion . 
  it is exactly what the downvote button is for . 
  yeah , but that alone imho does n't really justify european intervention .
