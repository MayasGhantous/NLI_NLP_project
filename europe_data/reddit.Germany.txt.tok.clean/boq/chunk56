  the eu employs fewer people than any larger european city , be it cologne or london . 
  its budget is around $ 120bn/yr , which is tiny in comparison to national or regional governments . 
  it is not bloated or wasteful . 
  its parliament is just as elected as any national parliament , its `` upper chamber '' , the council , consists of our national governments . 
  the commission is appointed by our governments and confirmed by parliament . 
  i do n't * really * see how that is less democratic . 
  it 's as intrusive as its mandate allows it to be so that it can do its job -- well , not intrusive enough , actually . 
  some things are n't working because they are left to the national governments and they 're stuck in a huge prisoner dilemma . 
   bearing these things in mind , why do you support it so much ? 
  why do you reject the idea of free sovereign nations that trade and cooperate with each over and can have all the benefits without being in a political union ? 
  we ca n't really trade freely if our trading rules differ . 
  with the eu 's single market i know that what i produce in portugal can be sold in germany , the uk , everywhere . 
  that requires certain political unity . 
  bilateral agreements between the 28 member states ( and the rest ) would truly be a bureaucratic nightmare , way worse than our current arrangement . 
   what gives you hope that this idea of a federal europe will succeed despite being the only continent on earth that is not growing , and where its share of world gdp has fallen from almost 40 % in the 1970 's , to a predicted 15 % in less than 7 years time . 
  what makes you think in the age of globalisation that protectionism can work ? 
  i think your argument is flawed since europe used to be way ahead of ( much of ) the rest of the world and now they are catching up . 
  it 's perfectly normal for our share to decline . 
  that said , what evidence of excessive protectionism do you have ? 
  i think the combined strength of the european economies allows us to adequately respond to protectionism by other blocs . 
   what gives you hope that there can be such thing as a federal europe , when the southern american countries , which have many similar cultures , and same languages , politely rejected all the ideas of federalism despite the wishes of the eu , and that it can work in this part of the world where there is a vast array and a massive collaboration of different linguistics and cultures . 
  it depends very much on what you think when you say `` federal . '', 
  i think of a common foreign and defence policy and an integrated economy . 
  research , too . 
  not ( lower ) education , not culture , anything else can stay with the states . 
  i do n't see why that should n't work : europeans , by virtue of geography alone , have similar foreign policy and security goals . 
  i recommend stuff like http://threema.ch/en/, 
  well . 
  if you 'd be a full member you would first pay in more and then get some back , leaving you with pretty much the same per capita contribution , perhaps even higher . 
  do n't think you 'd get a better deal in that regard . 
  also , you 'd be subject to the common fisheries and agriculture policies and you 'd be obligated to join the common currency at some point . 
  but yeah , i personally agree it 'd still be worth it to get a seat at the table . 
  you 'd strengthen the `` nordic bloc '' and maybe make said policies better for everyone . 
  as eea members you already pay pretty much what you 'd pay as a full eu member anyway . 
  http://xkcd.com/927/ :-d, 
  but the uk has an opt-out from the charter since lisbon in 2009 . 
  i really do n't want to rain on your parade , but does n't article 8 basically say `` protect privacy , unless you can make up any reason not to ? '', 
   article 8 -- right to respect for private and family life   1 . 
  everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence . 
  there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well-being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . 
  some of the things you mentioned are not even unified in some countries , for instance germany 's polics is state based , so is education . 
  the us also does n't unify these things completely . 
  seems to me like you 're projecting a little bit too much of france on everything . 
  foreign policy and the bulk of defence on the other hand ... sure . 
  [ a recent study ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-31845.pdf ) estimates possible savings of up to $ 15bn/yr . 
  nothing to sneeze at . 
  obviously they do n't give a damn about our civil liberties . 
  perhaps you could ask them about corporate espionage ? 
  fundamentally the greens and the cdu/csu are not as different as they sometimes pretend . 
  after all , they did get their first prime minister in one of the most conservative states , baden-w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  my money is on a grand coalition or black-green . 
  perhaps we were using the royal we ? 
  we will not do that . 
  / a pirate . 
  this is not a complete list . 
  that said , it 's easy to criticise from afar ; our manpower is spread pretty thin with everything there is to do . 
  perhaps you 'd like to lend a helping hand ? 
  i 'm serious , i 'm thankful for everyone who 's willing to get active . 
  sure . 
  we 're working on that . 
  agreed . 
  i would n't generalise so much . 
  perhaps if you are proud of the right things , it encourages you to keep doing them . 
  but i 'm afraid a lot of people are not proud of the right things . 
  more power to you !, 
  i mean , there is a lot of work to do and you do n't need slacktivists or idiots . 
  so do n't just vote , perhaps become a member and help them directly . 
  on http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/17/edward-snowden-nsa-files-whistleblower he says :  leaving the us was an incredible risk , as nsa employees must declare their foreign travel 30 days in advance and are monitored . 
  there was a distinct possibility i would be interdicted en route , so i had to travel with no advance booking to a country with the cultural and legal framework to allow me to work without being immediately detained . 
  hong kong provided that . 
  iceland could be pushed harder , quicker , before the public could have a chance to make their feelings known , and i would not put that past the current us administration . 
  snowden has given us no reason to doubt that . 
  he explained that . 
  as an nsa employee , he ca n't travel freely and would have been caught if he had tried to go there directly . 
  schindetnemo says they 're for friend/foe identification . 
  i do n't understand . 
  what do the keys decrypt ? 
  last i heard the dutch pirates could use some level-headed members . 
  the things is , what are keys for * exactly * ? 
  does the plane really not fly without them ? 
  or is it for gps or something ? 
  potato no stolen . 
  potato privatised . 
  immunity for mps is a part of separation of powers . 
  apparently i did n't get my point across : media success is indeed limited , but definitely not for lack of trying on our part .

  yeah , it 's a big country . 
  we got plenty of idiots . 
  everyone else has plenty of idiots themselves . 
  together , it 's just going to be another feed-back loop into idiocy . 
  let 's just not go there . 
  germany is too big for europe and too small for the world . 
  you do n't want a germany with national pride . 
  it wo n't be good for us , it wo n't be good for you . 
  perhaps some kind of pride in the local state ( see my flair ) would be more appropriate ; they 're too small for anything . 
  yes , when i was in portugal a few months ago i could buy a sim card no questions asked .
