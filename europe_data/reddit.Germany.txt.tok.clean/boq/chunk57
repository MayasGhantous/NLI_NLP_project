  i found that very odd . 
  but i also liked it very much ... 
  this just in : foreigners not happy when american president justifies surveillance with `` we only spy on foreigners . '', 
   i 'm just saying that the eu is such a huge and incredibly expensive bureaucratic monster that there must be other ways for the countries of europe to live together peacefully . 
  it really is n't . 
  total number of employees is about 50,000 , roughly as many as cologne has . 
  total budget is around $ 130bn , so about 1 % of eu gdp ( comparison to germany : remaining german government expenditure is over $ 1tn , so over 30 % of german gdp ) . 
   look at greece , look at spain . 
  is that the peace we want for europe ? 
  greek youths holding up nazi-merkel flags , for instance . 
  they do n't show you the greeks and spaniard who are not holding up such flags . 
  do n't be mislead . 
   if the eu concentrated on the important things , and not stuff like make it illegal for restaurants to serve olive oil in open containers , the allowed curve of cucumbers , the diameters of apples , the holding capacity of condoms , and stuff like that , i would be a huge supporter for it . 
  you do realise that stuff like cucumber , apple , condom regulations already exist in all countries and the eu only standardises them , yes ? 
  so you can produce one of said products in , say , portugal , and immediately be allowed to sell it in germany because the * same * rules apply throughout the entire market . 
  what * you * are suggesting , making trillions of bilateral agreements -- ** that ** would be a fucking bureaucratic nightmare . 
  crimes ? 
  to use the daily show 's words : `` nobody 's saying you broke a law . 
  we 're just saying it 's weird that you did n't have to . '', 
  a machine , any machine , is safe up to a certain point . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/design_basis_accident the natural disaster was too much for daiichi ( even though some safety systems like passive cooling exceeded their design targets by * 800 % * ) . 
  daini would have to be hit by something even worse to fail . 
  while that is true , the potential of renewables is less than what some believe . 
  here 's a good contribution to the topic : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5bvbfwuq-q, 
   most problems of nuclear reactors are unforeseen . 
  nobody thought the chernobyl accident was possible . 
  nobody thought the fukushima accident was possible , because it was n't an old soviet reactor . 
  that really is n't true . 
  western reactors at the time used another design because they knew what might happen to a 1980s rbmk . 
  similarly , the japanese knew what might be a problem in fukushima daiichi and fixed the issues in newer plants like fukushima daini , which is 10 years younger than daiichi -- i.e. 
  long before an accident happened . 
  when the same earth quake and tsunami hit fukushima daini , it shut down properly , barely making any headlines . 
  germany spends over $ 10bn per year to subsidize renewables . 
  that 's multiples of what * the world * spends on fusion . 
  yet , we germans are very far from having every roof `` solarized '' . 
  it makes me sad that people conduct this debate qualitatively and not quantitatively . 
  that 's really one of the reasons .

  same from bavaria . 
  must be the white and blue ... 
  404 humour still not found . 
  want to donate again ? 
  http://www.piratestarter.de/ ^ ( why is this for bavaria ? 
  there 's an election in bavaria 1 week before the federal election ; if the bavarian pirates do n't get at least a respectable result , the federal elections will be all but lost by default . ), 
  english is not the original language of this phrase . 
  if anything , we should look at the german , french or italian versions . 
  `` immer engeren zusammenschluss '' in german can definitely not be constructed to mean `` closer than at that point . '', 
  it indicates a continuous process of `` getting closer '' without a specified end . 
  it 's a common phrase of the form `` immer < comparative form of an adjective  . '', 
  for example , `` es wird immer w\u00e4rmer '' means it continues to get warmer . 
  or : it does n't stop to get warmer . 
  point being : the sentence in the treaty means : the peoples do n't stop getting closer to each other . 
  eventually , the closeness has to crush whatever political borders remain that can not be justified by subsidiarity . 
  else the union could still continue to get closer . 
  i do speak french , but i ca n't really say for sure . 
  `` sans cesse plus d'\u00e9troite '' can mean '' * forever * closer , '' too . 
  that is an interesting interpretation , but it does n't say `` ever closer * than now * . '', 
  so that 's simply not supported by the text . 
  if we always strive to be closer , at some point the union will be indistinguishable from any other country . 
  `` ever-closer '' to me implies a mandate to remove all obstacles between the peoples until none remain . 
  otherwise it would have been `` close '' , not `` ever-closer . '', 
  coupled with another important principle of european integration , subsidiarity , to me that only leaves something like a federation as a final goal . 
  sure , it might not be called a country in the end , but if it talks like a duck , if it walks like a duck ... 
  it 's literally on the second page of the 1957 treaty : http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/emu_history/documents/treaties/rometreaty2.pdf  determined to lay the foundations of an ** ever-closer union ** among the peoples of europe ,, 
  itt : lots of people claiming the cultural differences between european countries are `` bigger '' than those between american states . 
  how would we even measure that in an objective way ? 
  `` ever closer union '' ( sic ) has always been the goal . 
  what is that if not a euphemism for `` 1 country '' ? 
  does it really , though ? 
  in germany , abuse of welfare is between 100x and 1000x ( numbers vary according to source ) less severe than tax evasion , i.e. 
  for every euro of unjustified welfare we have hundreds of euros of evaded taxes . 
  i ca n't imagine it being so different in the uk . 
  perhaps we should direct our hatred towards that problem . 
  if that is full-on islamist , what do you call the theocracies ? 
  so , la c\u00f4te d'azur is orange county ? 
  do you think this could be mitigated if economic policy was handled properly on the european level instead of intergovernmentally as it is right now ? 
  there are plenty of workers and savers in germany and comparable eurozone countries . 
  is merkel not protecting them ? 
  can you explain a little more ? 
  how does it affect capital and financial assets more than , say , wages ? 
  and they still ca n't even print the prices on their products because they change every few miles due to different taxes . 
  i 'd call that significantly less centralisation than , for instance , germany . 
  the eu would be even less centralised , for mundane reasons like different languages . 
  but we even built you a railway to the capital ... ungrateful bunch !, 
  implying that health care would be within the competencies of a federal europe . 
  why would that be the case ? 
  everyone has freedom of panorama , that includes `` your property '' if it is publicly visible . 
  whether or not someone can profit from that is none of your business . 
  it 's public space . 
  you have no right to impede anyone 's right to take photos from public space . 
  next thing we know someone stops a journalist from taking pictures ... no thank you . 
  sometimes i hate my countrymen . 
   which just so happen to make small and medium sized businesses suffer that 's why in other eu countries smes suffer so much as well . 
  germany , for instance . 
  why should that be a joke ? 
  they have to deposit 1 % and get to work with the rest . 
  some say it goes too far already . 
  some say it does n't go far enough . 
  the eternal dilemma of * everything * . 
  yes , that 's the problem .
