  you ca n't possibly know whether they were originals or not because at best you saw some pictures . 
  be honest , you ca n't dispute it . 
  it 's impossible . 
  to be certain you have to actually put your hands on the device . 
  and the far-east is flooding the world with knock-offs that simply do n't reach us in the west due to our copyright regimes and attentive customs agents . 
  regardless : poverty does n't make a refugee , and that someone was able to carry his 150gram heavy phone with him does n't make him any less helpless or any less of a refugee . 
  oh man , have you considered that you might just have seen [ an s5 knock-off ] ( https://www.cect-shop.com/en/no-1-s7-galaxy-s5-schwarz.html?___from_store=de ) ? 
  not that it matters much that you saw one fucking s5 among thousands of people . 
  it does n't look like the resisting government 's agree with you , otherwise they could just agree to the quota and wait until the `` problem '' resolves itself . 
  what ? 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  first of all : no , a study is way more than anecdotal evidence . 
  it 's the exact opposite of anecdotal evidence . 
  and second : i ( or rather the guy i linked to ) have provided evidence . 
  now it 's up to the other guy to provide something . 
  you ca n't just say `` oh i did n't like that so it 's not evidence '' . 
  so if you find some bad behaviour among hundreds of thousands who have been through the worst for weeks and months then it 's indicative of the whole group , but if arafat is doing something good he 's an outlier . 
  you do n't see a problem ? 
  the vast majority does not make the news . 
  you ca n't form an impression based on that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/refugee-crisis-the-grim-reality-faced-by-the-syrian-refugees-stranded-in-lebanon-10490463.html ) 's the reality for those who have fled to lebanon . 
  i ca n't blame anyone who wants to get someplace else . 
  that does n't make them any less of a genuine refugee and it most certainly does n't make them islamists . 
  i mean , we have crazy muslims going from europe to syria to fight . 
  those fleeing syria are definitely not big fans of their ideas . 
  before the war , syria was a fairly secular , middle-income country . 
  its inhabitants are n't so different from us . 
  if not for the arabic script , [ these pictures ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/pm/2010/12/hugh_in_damascus.shtml ) could be from several european cities . 
   and on a related note , i do n't recall the million romanian diaspora in italy doing what syrians are doing right now in every country they grace with their presence until they reach germany . 
  could it be because romanians had visa free travel for well over a decade and could legally get to italy , spain and so on ? 
  atlassib did n't start out as human trafficking , you know . 
  still western europeans blamed romanians for crime and all kinds of bad things ( and they were talking about ethnic romanians , before you try to pull the `` roma '' card ) . 
  it was n't fair to us , it 's not fair to the syrians . 
  eu sunt n\u0103scut \u00een bucure\u0219ti , so romania is my country , too . 
  if anything i 'm talking about our country . 
   crooks and scum who want safety and benefits without working for it like i and the majority of my countrymen do . 
  tragically comedic : this is verbatim what many western europeans said about romanians . 
  syrians * want * to work and they are just as decent people as we are . 
  one would imagine that someone like raed arafat would have at least conveyed that to the average romanian . 
  freedom of movement is for eu citizens and maybe regular residents , not third-country nationals here as refugees . 
  but regardless , it does n't matter . 
  refugees assigned to another eu state will not receive benefits in germany even if they travel here . 
  \\* chuckles \\* i 'm a trained natural scientist , so you do n't have to lecture me about statistics -- i know more about it than you do . 
  but feel free to link to the `` totality '' of studies , i 'd be more than happy to take a look . 
  in gta v there is fake news story about how america is ruined to the point where immigrants are avoiding it and a republican being happy about it in the interview . 
  this is you right now , a parody from gta turned reality , happy about the misery of his home as long as it keeps foreigners away . 
  cut the nose to spite the face ... 
   they have n't integrated . 
  that 's [ not true at all ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k1yne/in_2010_merkel_denounced_german_multiculturalism/cuu7rmn ) . 
  maybe it 's time to shed your prejudices . 
  :-) `` politics is a strong and slow boring of hard boards . 
  it takes both passion and perspective . '', 
  max weber, 
  no , merkel 's government said it wo n't deport syrians back to the peripheral eu states in a belated attempt to take some pressure of those member states . 
  and no , it 's not a violation of their rights . 
  have you ever considered that perhaps it 's not necessarily the economy that makes sweden , britain or germany attractive , but rather the fact that their general populations as well as their governments have n't broadcasted an image of bigotry across the world ? 
  i mean , i doubt many syrians read / r/europe but if they did , or if they consumed other media , they 'd have to be very brave or very stupid to try to go to eastern europe . 
  hell , there are barely any foreigners in ee and we 've already seen stuff like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jgowh/immigration_center_set_on_fire_in_estonia/ ) or [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dv3jw/hungary_undergrad_girl_beaten_up_because_his/ ) -- it 's basically eastern germany minus a government and people that are believably fighting back . 
  an inhuman , inhospitable place . 
  do n't misunderstand me , i 'm not saying this to be insulting , it 's more an expression of my sadness about this situation -- especially because i 'm from ee myself . 
  in hungary quite a few decent people helped the refugees . 
  whether they were religious i ca n't say , but they sure as hell behaved more christian than their premier who talks about preserving our christian identity . 
  i 'm sure such great people exist everywhere , especially among poland 's many catholics . 
  let 's just hope their views will take over before refugees burn like they did in germany 20-something years ago . 
  please do n't give up even if you do n't enjoy it any more . 
  i 'd love to believe that and i will believe that when i hear budapest announce how many refugees they are willing to accommodate voluntarily or when they agree to a quota proposal . 
  until then it looks like orban 's people are failing on purpose so his government does n't have to commit . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:12012p/txt article 18, 
  the first part is , in a way , right : it 's only the peripheral states ' problem . 
  but is it right to leave them alone with that ? 
  the [ second part is a stretch if not outright false ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jxxox/sanctions_weighed_for_nations_that_refuse_refugees/cutal3r ) . 
  itt : `` merkel invited everyone , it 's her problem '' no . 
  what merkel and her government have done was to tell the eu 's peripheral states that syrians who reach germany will not be deported back to them , even though germany could do that under the dublin regulation . 
  that is a belated attempt to help these peripheral states cope with the numbers . 
  however , it has no impact whatsoever on the share of syrian refugees accepted in the eu : * [ total applications of syrians ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l6w1fe4.png ) * [ total accepted applications of syrians ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1bwlnhv.png ) as you can see -- even though these numbers are just about first instance decisions -- every single eu member state already grants asylum to the vast majority of syrian applicants . 
  for all intents and purposes , the whole of europe recognises that virtually every syrian is in need of protection . 
  the only difference now is that the peripheral states do n't have to host the new syrian arrivals themselves but can let them make their way to germany instead . 
  they signed up to the refugee convention and the eu treaties that explicitly call for respecting the universal human right of asylum . 
  everyone just making their way to germany is an exception that ca n't and wo n't become the rule . 
  i 'm still hopeful there will be some eu solution to handle refugees in a decentralised manner . 
  i hear the latest proposal is to beef up frontex instead of relying on the peripheral members and have it then handle the entire asylum processing stuff . 
  if we added < 18males to the 33 % in my other post , it would become even more than 33 % . 
  is that what you meant ? 
  i did n't think this would make the argument more substantial if girls and women alone already amount to 33 % without the boys . 
  i have n't looked into this enough to give an informed opinion but i imagine it would be much easier if all eu member states chipped in . 
  that 's an independent issue . 
  the authorities need the resources to enforce the result of due process and i do n't think anyone has a problem with giving them those resources . 
  also , it would be nice if you could cite your numbers . 
  for example , a lot of balkan applicants leave on their own without the need for intervention and that might change them drastically . 
  their age should n't have a bearing on the argument . 
  regardless , the statistics in the screenshots include all ( fe ) male applicants of all ages -- but you can split it into 0-13 , 14-17 , 18-34 , 35-64 , and  65 if you have too much time on your hands . 
  the dataset is stored as [ migr_asydcfstq ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asydcfstq&amp;lang=en ) , you can add the age brackets with the '' + '' next to the age dropdown . 
  which matters ... not at all , because a large share of all applications is rejected . 
  what might matter are the accepted applications . 
  * [ accepted male applications ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcjsexz.png ) * [ accepted female applications ] ( http://i.imgur.com/icyx5ko.png ) add up the numbers , the ratio becomes about 2:1 , i.e. 
  ~ 33 % women/girls . 
  so , if only 1 in 2 accepted male applicants intend to apply for family reunification afterwards , the ratio becomes already 1:1 . 
  huh , suddenly this is all much less extreme , is n't it . 
  you people need to learn how to properly work with numbers . 
  otherwise you might seemingly win an argument against other statistically uneducated redditors , but you 'd still be wrong .
