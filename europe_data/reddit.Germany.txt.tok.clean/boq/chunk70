  an uncontrolled collapse of the euro would affect the german economy extraordinarily . 
  in spite of all the difficulties that appear on the way to deeper integration , german leaders should have a big interest in consequently stabilising the architecture of the european currency union . 
   it is about a fundamental regulative course setting . 
  in the future , should europe be disciplined by `` anonymous financial markets '' or should it be shaped by democratically legitimised political processes ? 
  in the words of foucault ( 2004 ) , it is about the question whether we want the state to be under the supervision of the market or the market to be under the supervision of the state . 
  if we reject a regression to national currencies , one has the choice between the dominance of the financial markets or the transfer of certain sovereign rights to the european level . 
  and yet , the surrender of national sovereignty is smaller than it might appear at first sight . 
  those who are subject to the erratic processes of the financial markets ultimately do not enjoy any meaningful material sovereignty . 
   after the experiences of the financial crisis and the destabilising processes of the phase between 2010 and july 2012 there is little to be said in favour of entrusting oneself to the shaping processes of the financial markets -- as the majority [ of the wise men ] has suggested . 
  the way forward to more political integration in europe is difficult , but ultimately without alternative . 
  although i will not translate the summary of the majority 's opinion , i did read it and i have to say that i am somewhat glad that the german government regularly ignores the opinion of the council of economic experts . 
  berlin , paris and rome have -- more or less -- already voiced their support for bofinger 's point of view and further integration . 
  being called illogical and unreasonable is not dehumanising .

  this comes after similar comments from [ paris ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dtkbi/france_favours_establishment_of_euro_government/ ) and [ berlin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ejllm/eurozone_budget_sch%c3%a4uble_open_to_eurotax_in/ ) . 
  what does this have to do with a eurozone budget that is funded by taxes , not state contributions ? 
  dc levied taxes long before the affordable care act . 
  if you ca n't formulate a proper argument , why keep writing ? 
  whatever constraints they may face , they 're not caused by taxes to dc . 
  american states can levy all the taxes they can think of even though their federal government also levies its own taxes . 
   would this increase current taxes ? 
  too early to tell . 
   would this reduce the member states sovereignty ? 
  too early to tell . 
   who would regulate the taxes ? 
  too early to tell , but going from the proposals so far : probably some kind of eurozone parliament . 
  1 ) article 42 ( 7 ) of the treaty on european union is a mutual defence clause and 2 ) of course reducing redundancies would save money . 
  i do n't want to sound needlessly snippy but if the finnish government does n't reverse the trend of the last months/years soon it , too , will find itself on the receiving end of the hypothetical 5 % . 
  the same might happen if russia continues its behaviour and further damages its trade with finland . 
  the idea of writing down the same rules again with the biggest change being the addition of the words `` this time we 're serious ! '', 
  does n't really convince me . 
  the baltic states have only been in the euro for a few years . 
  greece 's woes were not caused by cohesion funds . 
  your description sounds very similar what we have in place now . 
  what is the big difference ? 
  how does it deal with asymmetric shocks and economic imbalances ? 
  as we have seen and as it has been forecast before the crisis , the common currency can not exist indefinitely without a political structure to support it . 
  asymmetric shocks and economic imbalances are slowly ripping it apart and the intergovernmental solutions that have been put in place so far are breeding resentment across the continent . 
  we can either fix that or give up the common currency . 
  without the common currency there will be exchange rate risk that will prevent the economies of europe from properly growing into one . 
  so , either you want sustainable european integration and then we have to make this step in one way or the other -- the details of which can be discussed , of course -- or you do n't , and we have to roll the whole thing back . 
  what third way are you suggesting ? 
  there 's little reason to continue in this incomplete , intermediate stage of integration just to appease sceptics who are never satisfied . 
  it could be better but i ca n't be bothered to invest more time : http://i.imgur.com/wi0keky.gif, 
  if you need help in a non-eu country where your country has no diplomatic mission , any embassy of another eu country will treat you like their own citizens . 
  what answer do you want ? 
  you group lebanon together with canada , norway , iceland or the us . 
  your `` arguments '' are completely outside the realm of rational discourse . 
  lebanon has human rights issues , part of it is under control of a terrorist group , it 's wedged between israel with which it is in a state of war while syria sinks into chaos and on top of it has to deal with as much as 1/4 of its population in refugees . 
  lebanon needs all the help it can get , and if that means helping them deal with the giant number of refugees that strain its infrastructure and government , then so be it . 
  if you have to selectively quote me and also go out of your way to construct absurd examples of people living in the us applying for asylum in the eu , it should tell you that your hand is not particularly strong . 
  evidently op does n't think lebanon is a `` nice '' country for him . 
   any non-eu country national or stateless person who is located outside of his/her country of origin and who is unwilling or unable to return to it owing to a fear of being persecuted can apply for refugee status . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l33176 ) ) op is ... * non-eu country national * located outside of * his * country * unwilling to return to a war zone and can thus apply for asylum in europe . 
  as the last few years show , around 99 % of syrian applications for asylum are accepted . 
  so , your opinion notwithstanding , op most definitely qualifies for asylum . 
  that you go on to ask how you can make money of his misery says a lot about you , but is irrelevant to the issue at hand . 
  i said nothing about poverty , just that the same behaviour that exists in east germany can be observed farther east , minus actual muslims . 
  there are virtually none and thus the likelihood of potential perpetrators and potential victims meeting each other is too small . 
  if the example from hungary was n't enough , here 's [ another incident from estonia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c68ye/bikers_former_mep_meet_locals_near_a_refugee_camp/ ) . 
  what do you think would happen if those friendly bikers met refugees ? 
  having said that , from my personal experience i expect romanians to be be more open-minded , but even there we had the anti-mosque thing in bucuresti a few days ago ( albeit rather small , from what i could gather ) . 
  we 'll see how it turns out ... 
  despite the fact that lebanon itself is not very rich , rather unstable ( e.g. 
  hezbollah ) and thus not really in the position to provide much care for many refugees , they do host over a million of them . 
  one in four residents is a refugee . 
  it 's an enormous burden and , personally , i would fear a collapse of the entire country if it gets much harder . 
  it would be wise to help out before it gets to that point . 
  neo-nazis beat up foreigners in east germany . 
  the reason why they 're not being beaten up farther east is not because no one would do it , but because there are n't any muslims there to beat up ( yet ) . 
  [ and sometimes not even that stops them ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dv3jw/hungary_undergrad_girl_beaten_up_because_his/ ) . 
   are there very serious issues or is it just news amplifying few negative cases the latter . 
  people need to remember that there are millions , even tens of millions of middle eastern and african origin in europe without causing a big fuss . 
  it is always the same thing : the fewer foreigners you have in an area , the more people are against having foreigners there . 
  in germany we have the most reactionaries in regions where there are virtually no immigrants . 
  in switzerland the immigration-cap referendum had the most votes in cantons with the fewest foreigners . 
  ukip campaigns against immigration and has the most success in regions with the fewest immigrants . 
  and so on and so forth . 
  however , once people meet the immigrants , interact with them , realise that it 's not a big deal and that people are pretty much the same everywhere , everything gets more relaxed . 
  i hope the few people that are going to be housed in eastern europe will start breaking that ice . 
  the most important thing is to not create marginalised ghettoes or camps but welcome them right in the middle of society . 
  modern germany 's handling of the nazi issue is a defining aspect of its self-image . 
  there is no `` enough with that '' . 
  as someone wrote in another thread , the world forgave germany because it did n't forgive itself . 
  ok , whatever makes you happy . 
  though i never heard an old person say they wished they had worked more . 
  also , when i asked about being on reddit , i meant time-wise . 
  if i seriously worked 80-100 hours a week , i would n't know where to find time to waste on reddit . 
  are you sure you 're not just half-assing work and inflating your hours ? 
  why ? 
  edit : also , how do you have time for reddit ? 
  clearly blue/white flags with orthogonally oriented vertical/horizontal features are bad for the economy . 
  this is a very good question and i 'm glad you brought it up . 
  the sub was getting a bit repetetive lately . 
  i 'm just going to rip out some of your phrases and write what i think . 
  sorry if it 's not so coherent , i 'm kind of watching chunks of data trickle through my analysis routines . 
   will to act this is ultimately the biggest advantage , the coherent will and ability to act . 
  assuming your hypothetical use is built like other real world federations , then its individual constituent states will have significantly less control over their federal government in the areas that are under its exclusive power . 
  nowadays in matters such as sanctions , europe is basically confined to the lowest common denominator .
