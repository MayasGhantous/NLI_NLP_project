  it can not force , say , the italian establishment to participate in sanctions unless they want to participate , limiting the options . 
  a federal government would be much less hamstrung by regional special interests -- and if these interests had a point , a federal government would have the ability to balance them . 
  italy might have to endure more suffering because of sanctions against moscow , but it could be compensated for it through a single , federal decision-making mechanism as opposed to two dozen ones . 
   why , exactly , is russia not going to turn off the gas on a use , if it would on the eu ? 
  that 's another point : there is no eu whose gas russia could turn off . 
  it could turn off the gas for individual countries and we know it does n't want to turn it off for others . 
  were the eu a country , russia would only have a binary choice : all or nothing . 
  it raises the stakes to a much higher level . 
  the kremlin does n't want to upset germany too much because it ca n't afford it . 
  by extension , it most definitely can not afford to upset german europeans + 430m other ones . 
   practical problems ( ... ) of a federal state with strong regional asymmetries that is another important aspect : the break-up of national voting blocs . 
  without making a judgement about the issue , let 's stick to your example of the iraq war : germany as a whole is considered a big opponent of the war . 
  if we look closer we remember how angela merkel argued in favour of participating . 
  it was a red-green government with a razor-sharp majority that kept germany out of it . 
  the idea that there are strong regional differences is strongly exaggerated . 
  germany was perhaps just a few seats away from joining the coalition . 
  those few seats made all the difference for the whole country . 
  it 's basically fptp with country-sized constituencies . 
  having said that , [ here are poll numbers ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:iraq_war_opponents.png ) from 2003 . 
  as you can see , in every single member state there were at least 50 % against the war , not that much variation there . 
  in fact , looking at these numbers , i can imagine that a federal europe might have collectively stayed out of iraq , which would have not only been the will of its citizens -- it might have also managed to convince an isolated us from going at it alone . 
  so , perhaps no civil war and instead , years later , an arab spring with less sectarian violence . 
  ( tl ; dr if you do n't want a federal europe , you are literally pro-isis ^ ^ scnr ^ ^ :-) )  europe 's defence spending is incredibly low well , let 's not sell ourselves too short . 
  the eu 's combined spending is about half of america 's . 
  that 's still about a quarter of the world 's total spending for a union with 7 % of the world 's population . 
  america has bases around the world and 11 super-carriers patrolling the oceans at any moment . 
  even if for practical reasons we might not immediately be able to field 5-6 super-carriers for our current spending , even 3-4 would be a net gain compared to what we have now . 
  note that i 'm not making a statement about the usefulness of super-carriers . 
   diverse and strong views within europe i think a federal europe would actually appropriate most views of its constituent states . 
  for example , if france has an interest in keeping the peace in western africa ( for example , to keep the uranium flowing to its power plants ) , then so will europe as a whole . 
  we all do n't need or want a collection of failed states across the med and we also do n't want the lights to go out . 
  -- another way of looking at is to hypothetically disassemble existing federations . 
  for example , is bavaria better off and/or more influential as part of germany or not ? 
  is it better to be austria rather than bavaria ? 
  ( personally , i do n't think so , most importantly because of the moderating influence of rest-germany that keeps our crazies a bit in check . 
  but do n't tell them , they 'd let it go to their heads . ), 
  i think you have that backwards . 
  is n't it more likely that the fruit is named after the country , i.e. 
  portocale being the fruit of portugal -- which has the same name in all languages , while [ only ex-ottoman territories call the fruit after the country ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ngdlzry.png ) ? 
  you are imagining things that no one has said . 
  no one said luxembourg gets 1/6 of the power or that any country gets to make policy in certain areas for everyone . 
  there can not be a discussion if you are just hallucinating things . 
  the french proposal specifically calls for a ez government with a common budget and a common parliament and considers the original founding members to be must-haves for the next step . 
  that 's all . 
  that is not the idea behind the european union and the only institution that follows that thought is the commission . 
  neither hollande nor anyone else would stop latvia , estonia , ireland et al from participating if they so desire . 
  hollande just considers the founding members to be must-haves . 
  if you want to have a say in luxembourg 's tax regime through a common ez government , you have to give luxembourg a seat at its table , too . 
  no , that 's why i gave the eurostat link . 
  take the countries of origin from the economist and the actual acceptance rates from eurostat . 
  while most applicants from gambia and senegal are not recognised as refugees , their numbers are not large enough to offset the overall share of accepted applicants , which is well over half of all applicants . 
  this is how it starts , with one mosque . 
  then , before you know it , they 're building mosques [ faster than romanians are building churches ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23420668 ) . 
  then what ? 
  huh ? 
  these people * are * refugees . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-6 ) the economist lists the countries of origin of the people crossing the med in 2014 . 
  you can see the total number of asylum applicants from each country by clicking through the various drop-down settings on the [ eurostat website ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-055298_qid_5ee20c25_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=time,c,x,0;geo,l,y,0;citizen,l,z,0;sex,l,z,1;age,l,z,2;decision,l,z,3;unit,l,z,4;indicators,c,z,5;&amp;zselection=ds-055298decision,total;ds-055298citizen,sy;ds-055298indicators,obs_flag;ds-055298sex,t;ds-055298unit,per;ds-055298age,total;&amp;rankname1=unit_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=age_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname3=decision_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=citizen_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname5=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname6=sex_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname7=time_1_0_0_0&amp;rankname8=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;ppcrk=first&amp;ppcso=asc&amp;sortc=asc_-1_first&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=none&amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23 ) . 
  as you see , the majority of applicants are not rejected , i.e. 
  qualify for some kind of protection under the law . 
  tl ; dr : the people in charge of deciding who is or is n't a refugee have concluded that most of them are refugees , the opinions of random redditors notwithstanding . 
  no , but i will try it if i get the chance . 
  well ... then ... tell me more about your favourite bangladeshi dishes that i should try ? 
  do i have to ask about your faith ? 
  i 'd rather hear more about your favourite bangladeshi dishes that i should try . 
  france is a net contributor . 
  switzerland belongs with the usa and germany in that list because federal law breaks cantonal law just like in america and germany . 
  keeping up in the sense of continuing to take part in global governance that affects everyone more and more ( e.g.climate change and other topics ) but is dominated by a minority of players . 
  for now , these are primarily western , but that will change , and there 's no guarantee the world will continue to be a place where small countries can retain as good a quality of life . 
  this is n't about some nebulous idea of success . 
  more and more important questions are beginning to transcend individual countries , whether it is climate change , the digital sphere or dealing with pandemics . 
  eventually these questions and those that will emerge in the future will be dealt with globally , but still affect everyone . 
  yeah , that 's because we 're not finishing the federation and instead leave a single member state able to pull shit like this . 
  i know , i was n't insinuating that they were . 
  it 's just that they are alternative future poles of the world . 
  they will want a seat at the table and they will be very powerful . 
  / u/barismancoismydad also mentioned today 's ranking of the hypothetical economy . 
  how is that going to help as brics+usa shape the world ? 
  i was using an extreme example to put across a point . 
  it 's not necessarily about this specific issue . 
  i have given several other potential ones in an earlier post . 
  but if you insist : the false belief of that entire arrangement being a partnership is exactly what sikorski was talking about . 
  how can you call yourself self-determined if the final decision about whether you are able to determine anything at all is made in moscow , washington and other places that are very much not in estonia ? 
  as the americans pivot away from europe , who knows how much they will continue to care about ancient european treaties . 
  i do n't know , i have the impression you are afraid of cheese regulation and tax brackets while my concern is for the very ability to not just fall in line with what bigger powers decide over our heads . 
   this is so silly , i do n't even know how to respond . 
  maybe i do n't have the eloquence necessary to convey the difference between really being in control of your fate and having that control in theory only , but if you care enough about this topic then surely you 'll eventually think through my silliness to the non-silly core of the argument . 
   how does a threat of being attacked negate our self-determination ? 
  shit can happen , but we 're still the captain of this boat . 
  being forced to follow bigger boats so a mean big boat ca n't mess with you is n't really self-determination any more than a robbery is an act of free trade . 
   we would n't just let it happen , we would fight till the last man and make it much more trouble than it 's worth . 
  that 's entirely missing the point , but sure , just like last time , i imagine . 
   estonia will not give up its sovereignty , not now and not for a very long time , short of going to war with us and winning , it just wo n't happen , you 'd have to pry it out of our cold dead hands . 
  yep , clearly i was not able to get through to you . 
  if the point of european integration in the 21st century is to keep up with the rest of the world , then a nordic union makes no sense as a replacement . 
  with 30m population it could become a much stronger and more coherent voice in europe , but hardly outside of it . 
  that 's the point . 
  european countries can fool themselves into believing they can decide everything on their own , but that does n't mean their decisions will carry weight . 
  to give you a tailored example , estonia can decide to be free of its big neighbour , but it will not be able to enforce that decision by itself . 
  for now , western powers ' promise to keep it that way , but * that * is not estonia 's decision .
