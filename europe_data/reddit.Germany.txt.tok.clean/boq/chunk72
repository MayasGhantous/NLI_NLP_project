  they could change their policy without ever asking * anyone * in estonia about their opinion . 
  is that truly estonian self-determination ? 
  hoping another power will not decide to trade estonia for something more valuable ? 
  no , it 's an illusion of self-determination . 
  [ poland 's former foreign secretary said it best ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28s9dj/new_secret_recordings_of_polish_officials/ ) . 
  every single one of our countries will slowly lose the ability to choose its own fate as more and more issues grow beyond their powers -- the digital sphere , pandemics , climate change . 
  big countries like germany or france will be able to hold off for longer , but the clock is ticking . 
  together we will have to make compromises in some areas , sure . 
  but together we have a realistic shot at turning our compromises into reality . 
  you have to do a lot of mental acrobatics to call someone who 's really far behind better off than the one ahead just because they 're going faster relative to their own place . 
   ee is developing quickly . 
  it has reasonable unemlpoyment . 
  eastern germany is stagnant , and unemployment is higher than in poland . 
  [ unemployment is basically the same , maybe a bit higher in poland ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/rsi/#?vis=nuts1.labourmarket ) . 
  1 ) ee offers potential to develop and 2 ) east germany has been declining since 1950 . 
  it had lost 15 % of its population by 1990 and has remained at that level since then . 
  there is now only a net movement from rural into urban areas . 
  1 ) is why its growth rates are larger , because the denominator is smaller . 
  that 's not a victory . 
  2 ) is happening in poland ( to stay with that example ) as well . 
  its population has been stagnating since 1990 . 
  altogether , you may feel like poland is better off , but by any metric it is just approaching east germany . 
  that in itself has nothing to do with the political set-up -- it would happen just as well ( if not faster due to increased trans-continental transfers ) if there was more integration . 
  as ee develops , so will eger as it is sandwiched between we and ee . 
  states of a federation * can * decide on their own laws . 
  they just have an additional mechanism for collective action through the federal institutions . 
  do compare them : [ as of last year , when it comes to how well people are off , not a single region in eastern europe that can compete with west * or * east germany ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2u6hav/purchasing_power_per_capita_map_of_europe_2014/ ) . 
  the idea that east germany would be better off outside of the frg is absurd . 
  it 's funny that you write that we can not agree on things as a counter-argument only to go on and state that denmark 's people ca n't agree on things either ( only `` most of the population in denmark '' allegedly agree ) . 
  i guess denmark must be dissolved because it just could n't possibly work out \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af  who would get to decide our political stance on things ? 
  we would have union-wide elections and then the winner of those elections would form a government and make decisions on matters delegated to the political union until the next election . 
  the european constitution would have been a much nicer text than what we have now , but it would not have given the eu any of the powers necessary to deal with the current situation . 
  we 'd be no closer to resolving it . 
  these arguments are n't wrong , they 're just missing the point . 
  germany was occupied . 
  the allies did n't need to trust germany , they controlled it . 
  with the latest agreement , we 'd be moving a bit closer to that situation , though . 
  not sure if it counts but i know of this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dewptfpfg0m, 
  normally i would agree with you , but the ft has a history of insider knowledge . 
  not sure how they do it , but they have good connections . 
  if you asked me , it would be rather hard for me to point to a merkel policy responsible for germany 's current relative strength . 
  it seems more like she 's riding out the consequences of the previous centre-left government . 
  not everyone can have a lethal external threat for motivation \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  warsaw must hurry with its development and help paris counter-balance berlin . 
  clearly , something about that city makes people go mad . 
  ^ ^ ( scnr ), 
  the ideas that are floating around at the moment are only for a base percentage of the last wage for the first ( up to ) 6 months of unemployment . 
  it would n't help with permanent economic woes , but soften asymmetric shocks . 
  at least on paper , romania meets the copenhagen criteria . 
  i 'm really looking forward to turkey meeting them as well . 
  a positive outcome of the current cyprus talks will hopefully reinvigorate the process . 
  if we federalists had our way , this would n't be happening . 
  let 's not forget that there are 19 national governments behind this shit show . 
  there are two different tracks of decision-making in europe : the community method with council and parliament for the regular eu legislation , e.g. 
  copyright stuff to name a recent example . 
  the other one is the intergovernmental method , where national governments meet and make the big and important deals . 
  here everything is the second method . 
  the eu summit is just national governments getting together . 
  the presidents of commission and parliament may sit in the room , but ultimately they are powerless . 
  they do n't have the money to make a deal because their institutions ca n't levy taxes . 
  and parliament was allowed a big show , again without power . 
  parliament could have a million votes on the issue and it would n't change a thing . 
  if you look closely you 'll find that the eu itself has virtually nothing to do with all of this . 
  the commission has no real power , parliament can talk but not act , the ecb just tags along trying to buy more time for national politicians to arrive at a decision for as long as it can . 
  it 's just 19 european governments whose representatives regularly meet in the buildings of the aforementioned institutions . 
  we ca n't continue in this not-quite-national-anymore-but-also-not-yet-supranational fashion for much longer . 
  i read it using a translator and yes , i suggested a new submissions with a different title . 
  if you read the article these pictures belong to , it 's not about demonising greece . 
  it 's a call to action for europe ( and denmark ) . 
  you should delete and re-submit this with a neutral title . 
  from what i 've seen of the inside of other parties , that is very likely . 
  unfortunately our idiots had their regulars ' table on twitter . 
  like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdzhpod87sw ) , i imagine . 
  of course it was n't feminism . 
  that 's an internet myth invented by self-proclaimed men 's rights activists and propagated by ignorant internet commenters . 
  honestly , the whole thing became an echo chamber . 
  like high-school . 
  when you 're in high-school , your problems look really important and life-threatening , even when they 're just non-issues to anyone with a bit of perspective . 
  [ people ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evsle28hogi ), 
  i was basically in the same position as you , except i tried to play the game , get organised and enact changes . 
  evidently we lost because too many of us abandoned the fight and handed those losers the party . 
  i know it 's unpleasant but at the end of the day , `` wenn der kl\u00fcgere nachgibt , regieren die dummen . '', 
  ah reddit , where stuff that did n't happen gets upvoted as long as it can blame feminism . 
  first of all , the pirates were not founded in germany after von der leyen 's dns blocking idea . 
  that happened in 2009 , the pirates were founded 3 years earlier in september of 2006 . 
  i know because i actively participated since then until late 2013 . 
  it was not an issue of platform that destroyed the pirates , it was a lack of formal power structures that led to a power vacuum which let any disagreement escalate into a huge struggle for power . 
  that 's what happened !, 
  as soon as the pirates grew and attracted more people and opinions , the flat hierarchy became a stumbling block and due to the ideal of transparency , everyone could watch every fight in real time . 
  and even then , it was n't feminism that lead to the biggest struggle of all , but economic and social policy ( unconditional minimum income ) and questions of internal organisation ( permanent online assembly or not ) . 
  that destroyed the poll numbers because no voter wants to be governed by a party that ca n't even agree on how it should run itself . 
  at no point did anyone bother reading the pirate 's platform in detail , which makes the in-fighting about policy even more needless and tragic . 
  on the streets , no potential voter ever went `` oh yeah , you lost my vote because of feminism/any other policy , '' just the constant fights . 
  welcome to europe : it 's been like this * forever * . 
  the last couple of decades , the eu 's era , are the first time we have been able to tone it down a bit . 
  it 'll never disappear entirely -- case in point , west germans complaining about east germans . 
  but it will continue to get better as we develop and grow closer together . 
  terminating the process because it has n't progressed as far and as fast as you would have wanted to is to draw a very short-sighted conclusion . 
  europe is using too much power . 
  by the time the world market pushes us towards more efficient appliances with higher energy prices , large parts of the world wo n't be able to afford their food any more .
