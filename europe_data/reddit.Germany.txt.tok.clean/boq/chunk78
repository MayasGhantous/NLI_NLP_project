  there was a reduction in youth unemployment in spain , greece and italy in the first couple of years of the common currency and a return to the old values ( or a moderate increase ) since the crisis began . 
  together this looks like the first years of the $ were a bubble and now that it has burst , it 's back to the old days , but not necessarily worse than before . 
  it 's unfortunate that we have not been able to channel the bubble into something more sustainable . 
  it says just that in the full report . 
  it 's just around 10 pages of text if you subtract white space and pictures . 
  just read it , people . 
  * a * version of d\u00f6ner kebap is german . 
  - ic , - ic - ic , of course . 
  well , maybe . 
  they seem to be different kinds of authoritarian so they might also stop each other from gaining more powers that the other might use against them in the future . 
  for example , if i understand correctly , mhp will not go along with the presidential reform . 
  now that it looks like akp and mhp will form a coalition , maybe a turkish / r/europe-an can tell us more about mhp 's stance regarding the eu ? 
  from what i read they seem rather sceptical , but maybe they regard the eu as one more check on another potential akp government in the future ( i.e. 
  are they more nationalist or secular ) ? 
  so , while we 're at it , how are the talks on reunification going on ? 
  schulz ( sic ) said it belongs to the eu in the sense that it 's a part of it :  you can not have a relationship with yourself . 
  the eu is and britain are one thing . 
  the uk belongs to the eu . 
  the out-crowd 's case ca n't be very convincing if it needs to take harmless facts out of context . 
  thankfully it looks like a broad majority is n't buying their stories any more . 
  i 've heard a lot of relativising from some capitals about how the opposition is more against a legally binding quota rather than the idea itself . 
  now let 's see how much voluntary assistance these governments will offer . 
  is it so unthinkable that someone might have genuinely changed his opinion after learning more information ? 
  you think europeans mostly drive like germans ? 
  the swedish state does n't suffer from the problems the greek one does . 
  not even remotely . 
  babies are n't international visitors . 
   international visitors ' numbers, 
  that 's a bit hyperbolic , do n't you think . 
  can we retreat back to `` that 's just plain wrong '' ? 
  i 'm not sure what you are referring to but if it 's ww2 : i think germany has an obligation towards poland . 
  that does n't change the broader picture that i sketched above ; most of europe 's wealth is concentrated in the former colonial powers and if we share and take part in it then we all have to remember where a lot of it came from . 
  i say this as someone who 's from eastern europe himself . 
  you do n't have to respond to this , but you should know that this is absolutely not true ; if you ca n't convince * me * , then you have n't really made your case well . 
  i have no problem with admitting i was wrong if i get to know what was right afterwards . 
  here i do n't even know * what * you are trying to convince me of . 
  the 65 were four months and two tranches later . 
  and why did you bother linking the 90 % ? 
  on that site , they cite a 207 page report for that number without giving a page number . 
  it might as well be made up . 
  anyway . 
  the point is , earlier you wrote the rest of europe 's financial institutions had unloaded their paper onto the taxpayer and that the haircut was only affecting greek institutions . 
  you have n't shown evidence to prove that and i showed that it could n't even have happened the way you described it because the bailouts did n't progress quickly enough for that . 
  that 's all . 
  look , i 'm not saying everything that went down was correct or even that i agree with how it happened . 
  however , * of course * the bailout went to the banks and pension funds and insurance companies and their customers . 
  greece had already spent * their * money before we got to the crisis . 
  that the money went back to the original owners who had lent it to greece is not scandalous in itself ( although i personally think the companies in question should have been nationalised since they were technically going broke and sold back into the market for a profit after restructuring ) . 
  normally the person making the assertion has to come up with the evidence . 
  well , ok , just this time : [ by june 2011 , only $ 44bn of the 2010 programme had been disbursed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_economic_adjustment_programme_for_greece#disbursement ) , which is not quite ~ $ 73bn . 
  even if all the money had gone just to french and german banks , it would still not have been enough to account for the entire reduction . 
  i do n't mean to play dumb , but if it 's so obvious , why do n't you show us how imf , ecb and eu have bailed them out ? 
  they could have sold them to organisations willing to take risks and bet on greek bonds . 
  i do n't know why you wrote `` you . '', 
  i 'm just a random redditor . 
  i have nothing to do with the fate of nations . 
  regardless , you misunderstand me . 
  i have not written anything about some european countries being indebted to others . 
  i just pointed out that the wealth in some countries has been achieved in less-than-legitimate ways and that even mutually beneficial relations lead to a transfer of this wealth from one side to the other . 
  you can not separate the lighter sides from the darker sides . 
  the article you refer to has a lot of links , but unfortunately none of them corroborate the statement you quoted . 
  this is a problem because by itself this site is not really reliable ( `` we are part of a global movement to break the chains of debt '' -- uh-huh ) . 
  the $ 110bn also do n't appear anywhere . 
  sorry , even if i like to believe you , you have n't been very convincing . 
  did you read the article ? 
  the neighbouring countries are already hosting millions of refugees and are reaching the limits of their means . 
  they 're all not exactly rich countries . 
  this is an interesting piece of history , but , personally , i think it 's not really necessary to counter the `` we never had colonies '' `` argument '' . 
  most , if not all currently living residents of the former colonial powers had nothing to do with the colonial injustice . 
  no one blames them personally for anything that happened back then . 
  any responsibility that exists today is not derived from individual acts of today 's britons or frenchmen or belgians or all the others . 
  instead , it comes from the simple fact that the former colonial powers exploited their colonies for their own benefit , be it the form of money , resources or political and military advantages against their competitors . 
  with the end of the colonial era , the active and direct exploitation might have ended , but the benefits derived until then were not returned . 
  the wealth that was created back then and that we still enjoy today has been , at least partially , achieved on the backs of the former colonies . 
  not only that , in many cases the actions of the colonial powers have set their colonies back and many are far away from recovering . 
  the argument that only the former colonies should be held responsible thus relies on that wealth only being beneficial to the former colonial powers . 
  but that is n't the case . 
  countries like poland or lithuania ( to stick with op 's example ) have received billions in funds over the last years from the former colonial powers . 
  their economies have grown richer through preferential trade with the former colonial powers . 
  millions of their citizens even moved to the former colonial powers to take part in their still more developed economies . 
  eastern europe benefits from the wealth of the former colonial powers in various ways . 
  maybe not as much as the powers themselves , but still quite a bit -- certainly more than the former colonies . 
  i like to think about these things like about an inheritance . 
  as a citizen of a country you inherit the whole country and its history , not just the good parts . 
  and to go on and make it really short and blunt , when someone accepts favours from a criminal 's heir , they 're not entirely innocent any more . 
  victim and deceased are used to describe completely different concepts . 
  the former refers to a person 's situation while the latter simply describes the state of their body . 
  the victim had relatives in britain . 
  if they ca n't show credibly that they are refugees , at best what they get is something my dictionary tells me is called `` exceptional leave to remain , '' where they can be kicked out any time ( ok , technically , that 's in germany , but since germany takes in so many refugees , it 's probably even harsher in the other countries ) . 
  the authorities go out of their way to not let it get to that , for example by using language experts to determine a person 's true origin . 
  for example , yesterday there was an article in a big newspaper concerning a yazidi family about to be deported to armenia because their kurdish accents do n't sound iraqi enough . 
  so , it 's simply untrue to believe that you can just lie and the state ca n't do shit about it . 
  there are many ways to establish whether someone is an actual refugee or not . 
  your conflating different issues . 
  of those that apply for asylum , the majority is accepted : [ here ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-6 ) the economist lists the countries of origin of the people crossing the med in 2014 . 
  you can see the total number of asylum applicants from each country by clicking through the various drop-down settings on the [ eurostat website ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-055298_qid_5ee20c25_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=time,c,x,0;geo,l,y,0;citizen,l,z,0;sex,l,z,1;age,l,z,2;decision,l,z,3;unit,l,z,4;indicators,c,z,5;&amp;zselection=ds-055298decision,total;ds-055298citizen,sy;ds-055298indicators,obs_flag;ds-055298sex,t;ds-055298unit,per;ds-055298age,total;&amp;rankname1=unit_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=age_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname3=decision_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=citizen_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname5=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname6=sex_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname7=time_1_0_0_0&amp;rankname8=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;ppcrk=first&amp;ppcso=asc&amp;sortc=asc_-1_first&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=none&amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23 ) . 
  as you see , the majority of applicants are not rejected , i.e. 
  qualify for some kind of protection under the law . 
  lorries at calais are just anecdotal information , they are n't an accurate representation of what is going on . 
  no , the threat is us abandoning our own ideals of solidarity , human rights and due process .
