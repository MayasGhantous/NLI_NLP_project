  there is no unlimited immigration . 
  this is about legitimate refugees , no matter how much some xenophobes want to frame it differently . 
  it 's not `` the north . '', 
  germany and sweden , for instance , host a lot of refugees . 
  in every other `` northern '' country you will find a sizeable amount of people who would n't mind doing more , even if they are not running the government at this point . 
  just stop with the us-vs-them crap . 
  it does n't help clear up issues , it 's not constructive in any way , and it 's not even accurate . 
  how was he rude to the journalist ? 
  i agree that he is very vague afterwards but during the answer he does say that they are aware of the geopolitical situation in `` that '' area and it looks to me like he is trying to not use certain words . 
  not sure . 
  unfortunately we can not heat what he 's saying to the reporter before giving the answer . 
  the answer was kind of vague , i agree , but he did n't sounds like he was n't taking it seriously and he most definitely did n't just laugh and move on as op suggested earlier . 
  that 's the point , no one proposed this specific system . 
  the newspaper die zeit just [ used it as an example ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-05/fluechtlinge-eu-quote-verteilung-schluessel/komplettansicht ) to explain why some countries might be in favour or against quotas . 
  this image is hypothetical . 
  it applies a variant of the internal german system to the whole eu . 
  i think i 've linked the relevant q&a video in another post . 
  maybe if you or someone else finds that part , we can see what he said in its entirety . 
  the few questions that i saw had answers far longer than just two sentences . 
  [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/video/player.cfm?sitelang=en&amp;ref=i103765 ) should be the entire q&a of the press conference . 
  i only skimmed it very quickly becuase i do n't have time , maybe you can look through it a bit . 
  i would be really really surprised if the answered a question with laughter only . 
  it just sounds incredibly unprofessional . 
  can i see a video of that happening ? 
  that 's a much more nuanced position that can be used as a basis for further negotiation . 
  you just repeated what you wrote before . 
  staying in the first place where no one is shooting at you directly is not a requirement for being recognised as a refugee , though e.g. 
  over 90 % of syrian refugees do stay in syria 's neighbouring countries . 
  perhaps [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/39q01n/i_29_m_escaped_from_ghouta_to_germany_on_a/cs5j6hv?context=1 ) will help you understand better . 
  as my links show , the authorities have recognised the majority as refugees , the opinions of random redditors notwithstanding . 
  eh , i 'll wait till i see new data , not just articles quoting anonymous sources . 
  good . 
  it 's time the rest of the eu pulls their weight . 
  the right to asylum is enshrined in the eu 's charter of fundamental rights as well as various un documents that all eu member states have signed up to , plus who knows how many domestic laws . 
  the vast majority of people crossing the med nowadays are refugees and are thus entitled to the protection our own laws grant them . 
  ^ [ here ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-6 ) ^ ( the economist lists the countries of origin of the people crossing the med in 2014 . 
  you can see the total number of asylum applicants from each country by clicking through the various drop-down settings on the ) ^ [ eurostat-website ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-055298_qid_5ee20c25_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=time,c,x,0;geo,l,y,0;citizen,l,z,0;sex,l,z,1;age,l,z,2;decision,l,z,3;unit,l,z,4;indicators,c,z,5;&amp;zselection=ds-055298decision,total;ds-055298citizen,sy;ds-055298indicators,obs_flag;ds-055298sex,t;ds-055298unit,per;ds-055298age,total;&amp;rankname1=unit_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=age_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname3=decision_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=citizen_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname5=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname6=sex_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname7=time_1_0_0_0&amp;rankname8=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;ppcrk=first&amp;ppcso=asc&amp;sortc=asc_-1_first&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=none&amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23 ) . 
  ^ ( as you see , the majority of applicants are not rejected , i.e. 
  qualify for some kind of protection under the law . ), 
  italy is doing the right thing . 
  eurostat numbers show that the majority of people crossing the med really are refugees that need our help . 
  the rest of the eu must live up to its own laws and provide the asylum that they are entitled to , not just leave the border countries to their own devices . 
  why did you focus on the pyramid schemes only and left out the cults ? 
  if you 're a teenager without much going on in his life who never watches the news because conspiracy theories told you it 's all lies anyway , then yeah , there might not be a difference to them at all . 
  some stupid teens become neonazis or criminals or join cults for less . 
  sometimes it 's important to look at graphs quantitatively and not just qualitatively . 
  this graph shows no vicious circle . 
  a circle is infinite as you go along . 
  but here , you can clearly see that spending cuts do not go 1:1 with revenue reduction and that revenue would exceed spending at some point . 
  maybe , but that 's not what he wrote . 
  i think a better answer would have been to reject the false premise of muslims being a `` hostile culture . '', 
  the lines on the ground mean nothing and european integration is the political acknowledgement of that fact . 
  a brit today is n't personally responsible for past colonialism just because he lives in a certain area , but he still benefits from it today . 
  so do people from non-colonial powers when their country gets subsidies from the former colonial powers or lucrative trade relations or other opportunities that might not have existed without the colonial history . 
  yes , i should have used more words for that , sorry . 
  what i meant was that the author , on the one hand , decries the eu as part of the globalisation process ( which he does n't seem to agree with ) . 
  he also has a problem with ttip , which he sees as another tool for multinationals . 
  on the other hand , a few paragraphs later , he has no problem claiming that outside the eu the uk could make more money by forging better trade relations with countries outside the eu , even though that should be just as much part of the ugly globalisation process that he is n't fond of . 
  the first part is maybe something that some lefties , who oppose globalisation and free trade , truly believe , but the second part just makes his text inconsistent . 
  no , but big capital moves around the world just fine without the eu . 
  this is a terrible article . 
  its `` arguments '' are incoherent and incomplete or outright dishonest . 
  additionally , i had a hard time identifying anything in it that would qualify as left-wing . 
  in fact , i would argue that it was not left-wing at all . 
  it spent more words praising national identities , cultures and traditions and stirring up an us-vs-them narrative between nationalities than arguing against class-divide and capital , it criticises truly open borders and uses international trade arguments . 
  it also re-heats the old corporate eu argument , as if multinational corporations would n't already cross borders as if they did n't exist whereas the eu open borders allow regular people and smaller companies to do the same within europe . 
  i 'd be happy to read a real left-wing case for leaving the eu , but this was n't it , at all . 
  everything can be a country if you have enough guns . 
  the anthem of the federal republic of germany is the third stanza of the [ deutschlandlied ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutschlandlied ) , and only the third stanza . 
   since world war ii and the fall of nazi germany , only the third stanza has been used as the national anthem . 
  the stanza 's beginning , `` einigkeit und recht und freiheit '' ( `` unity and justice and freedom '' ) is considered the unofficial national motto of germany , and is inscribed on modern german army belt buckles and the rims of some german coins . 
  the phrase `` deutschland \u00fcber alles '' in the first stanza was misused by the nazis to elevate germany above other countries . 
  its original intention was to rally germans to transcend their countless small fiefdoms and come together as one germany . 
  it happens often enough that we have a phrase for it in german that would translate as cushioning the ball or playing against the board . 
  fortunately , in more and more areas the media is calling them out . 
  personally , i do n't hold budget control in high regard either . 
  budgeting is a core job of any government and it would make things muddy again if others could meddle in it . 
  instead , i 'd prefer something like a common base unemployment insurance . 
  everyone pays into the fund and gets x % of their last pay-cheque or the first 6 months of unemployment . 
  in case of an asymmetric crisis , funds would flow automatically to where they are needed to soften it . 
  i do n't know what their income profile is and i think this exercise is not likely to yield useful numbers so i 'd rather not put in any work to find the data . 
  the greek governments have made grave mistakes , but so have the other european countries , imho . 
  they decided to take on much of the greek debt instead of letting the original private lenders take most of or even the entire hit . 
  lending money comes with a risk but for some reason we largely ignored this principle and bought most of greece 's bonds -- not for the original price , but still too much , imho . 
  after a default back then , greece could have had a fresh start with room to breathe and appropriate interest rates for fresh debt and the lender states could have acquired failing lenders for a penny , kept them solvent if necessary and sold them later ( maybe even for a profit ) once the companies had been restructured . 
  so , i broadly agree with you . 
  europeans should n't be angry about each other but about the fact that basic and * necessary * pillars of a free market were not upheld . 
  i 'm broadly in favour of some kind of transfer union but without some kind of community oversight , i would n't open my wallet either . 
  the problem is that the issue is handled intergovernmentally instead of communally . 
  as you can see , this is already happening , with leaked drafts rather than official ones . 
  i understand your frustration but clearly the established way of negotiating treaties behind closed doors is no longer suitable for the information age . 
  people just fill the gaps with their own imagination . 
  perhaps i have too much faith in the british government and its civil servants , but i like to think that they would not have pursued policies that would lead them into such a position knowing they had no free access to a printing press . 
  or maybe they would have even had such access if britain had committed to the euro . 
  it could have tipped the majority in favour of having the ecb as a regular lender of last resort , at least in extraordinary circumstances . 
  really , i think it 's incredibly hard to imagine what would have happened over the last 23 years if black wednesday had n't happened in 1992 . 
  that 's a long time . 
  if i 'm informed correctly , the quran only ever mentions wine but makes no rules whatsoever on beer or hard liquor . 
  someone more knowledgeable correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  thank you , i appreciate the response .
