  i agree that the situation is in dire need of a solution and i hope we will be able to find one that combines respect for human rights as well as for the justified reservations some in europe might have . 
  it 's nice to see that you generally support the right to asylum and due process and only have a problem with the traffickers . 
  by reforming its own rules , europe can cut them out of the whole process . 
  biometrics is enough , i just gave you the dna example as a needless over-the-top measure . 
  having said that , you ca n't just apply this court ruling to asylum applications . 
  if europe were really facing a large number of rejected asylum seekers trying to illegally enter , the court could very well rule differently . 
  again , not that it matters since biometric information is sufficient . 
  though i 'm not sure why you care so much about human rights . 
  from what i 've read , you seem not to have a problem with denying them their right to asylum and due process . 
  biometric identification uses fingerprints as well as facial structure and retinas . 
  if that were by some miracle insufficient , you could even take a dna sample from rejected asylum applicants on file . 
  that would not be very smart since we 'd have them on file . 
  i may be misunderstanding you , but if you are concerned about their safety , all that needs to change is a law so that no one has to get on a boat * at all * . 
  then they can fly in , and in case their asylum application is denied , fly back . 
  considering the paper trail of air travel , it will also be much easier to check for valid asylum applications . 
  not necessary , just a law must be changed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo0irsfrpq4 for example , by requiring airlines to charge people without a valid visa for a return ticket in advance instead of stopping them . 
  i 'm not one to subscribe to crazy conspiracy theories . 
  we 've seen calls to brigade this subreddit and others on sites like stormfront . 
  we can also see some users who are active here frequenting subreddits like r/coontown or r/european . 
  this is n't just a chaotic circlejerk , it 's organised . 
  i think it 's wrong to surrender the playing field of opinion to these bigoted brigades because it creates the impression that there is no opposition to their ideas . 
  fortunately , where i live people do n't have these attitudes so there 's not much else for me to do except fight them as a keyboard warrior online . 
  i think you missed the point . 
  regardless of whether what you write is right or wrong , we 're not calling the general populace racist . 
  we 're talking about this : there is systematic brigading of these debates on this subreddit , skewing them in a racist direction . 
  just for the other readers , / u/ewannnn is referring to table 5 of [ this page ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) . 
  unfortunately , he misread it . 
  as the title suggests , these are just final decisions , i.e. 
  the ones that were denied the first time and had at least one appeal . 
  of these , and only these , 23k are accepted . 
  that does not yet include the first round of acceptance , shown in table 4 , where another 160k are accepted . 
  160k +23 k = 183k of the original 357k are , in fact , a small majority . 
  not that it matters a lot , because this thread is specifically about boat migrants arriving from across the mediterranean . 
  the raw numbers on the table , however , include every kind of asylum seekers , including , for example , people from kosovo and serbia , that are artificially inflating the rejection numbers . 
  if we look , as i did , at the nationalities of the people crossing the sea and their asylum acceptance rates , we can see that the overwhelming majority is , in fact , accepted . 
  i sincerely believe you misread the data and are n't trying to spin this . 
  let 's hope i 'm not wrong . 
  i think that 's too prone to false positives . 
  i have a few ideas that i would rather not share publicly , but they seem to exceed automoderator 's abilities . 
  maybe if i have some time i 'll try to whip up a prototype bot myself and see if it performs as i hope . 
  no promises . 
  i think manual action is too cumbersome , there must be an automated way or it 'll be really hard to deal with it . 
  yes , it 's pretty irritating . 
  there must be some way to combat this . 
  these comments ... m ( yes , all africans will soon be in europe . 
  also , oil has run out 20 years ago . 
  japan now dominates the world . 
  new york city is uninhabitable due to huge amounts of horse manure . 
  based on data from the last three decades , i am immortal . 
  meanwhile in the real world , none of that is correct . 
  [ potential net migration to europe is at around 10 % ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/166796/potential-net-migration-index-declines-countries.aspx ) if everyone were free to move wherever they want . 
  regardless , [ most people coming across the sea are from war-torn countries and truly asylum seekers ] ( http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/the-mediterranean-migration-crisis-in-four-charts--lygcbrt1jlz ) ( syria , eritrea , afghanistan are among the top countries of origin ) . 
  as you can see on [ this chart ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_in_the_eu-28_by_outcome,_selected_citizenships,_4th_quarter_2014.png ) , last year virtually everyone from syria and eritrea managed to convince the authorities of their refugee status . 
  they are not economic migrants or they would have been rejected like about 60 % of total applicants are ( e.g. 
  serbia or to a lesser degree kosovo ) . 
  you can find more on eurostat , i 've prepared a small data set with eritrea , syria , somalia and mali [ here ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-055298_qid_-6300dd14_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=time,c,x,0;geo,l,y,0;citizen,l,z,0;sex,l,z,1;age,l,z,2;decision,l,z,3;unit,l,z,4;indicators,c,z,5;&amp;zselection=ds-055298decision,total;ds-055298citizen,er;ds-055298indicators,obs_flag;ds-055298sex,t;ds-055298unit,per;ds-055298age,total;&amp;rankname1=unit_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=age_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname3=decision_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=citizen_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname5=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname6=sex_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname7=time_1_0_0_0&amp;rankname8=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;sortc=asc_-1_first&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=none&amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23 ) . 
  on the top right you can add more `` citizens '' to see how their country of origin fares when it comes to asylum applications . 
  there is more information on eurostat 's website , for example [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) or [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_quarterly_report ) . 
  tl ; dr : most boat people are legitimate asylum seekers entitled to our protection and even if they were n't , europe is not in danger of being overwhelmed edit : yeah , sure , a comment full of valid data and a torrent of downvotes . 
  i 'm sure it deserves not be read and there is absolutely no brigading . 
  at least the waste would be their problem and not someone else 's . 
  so much for the polluter principle . 
  he 'll surely explain how a report that is n't published yet paves the way to all these things and how the euro has reduced dutch wealth even though the dutch economy was growing steadily between 2002 and the crisis . 
  ^ scnr, 
  it 's virtually impossible that you have been on this subreddit for extended periods of time and not already read a comment by someone on how the constitutional treaty is different from the lisbon treaty and how the irish actually got some concessions before the second vote , and yet you ca n't help yourself but write down the exact opposite another time . 
  fine by me . 
  though for completeness , all i 'm saying is that in a number of majority-muslim countries , the legal situation for homosexuals is literally the same as it is in most of eastern europe . 
  there is nothing wrong with that statement , at all . 
  that does n't mean the situation is okay in all majority-muslim countries , but it does mean that there is no point in generalising them . 
  i 'm sure everyone knows how sensitive this issue is so i suggest you wait for the actual proposal before saying `` no . '', 
  you showed a map about a u.n.vote that means nothing because countries vote along bloc lines and because the u.n. has no power to enforce this resolution anyway . 
  i showed you a map where the whole of eastern europe and a sizable number of muslim countries are shown to treat gays exactly the same before the law . 
  it 's not a needless generalisation when the whole of ee has the same legal situation , but it is a needless generalisation when there is a strong variation within the muslim world . 
  well . 
  okay then . 
  i still like you though . 
  that article says nothing about vacations or how many are supposedly taking them . 
  it 's a short skit , not a whole segment , and it 's completely benign . 
  culinary , historical and linguistic jokes , plus some self deprecating ones , but not a word about politics ( or bashing anyone ) . 
  i like not generalising where is neither appropriate nor necessary . 
  no , i listed specific countries where the situation is the same , but for some reason you continue to ignore them and point at those where the situation is worse in an attempt to generalise the whole bunch . 
  it will likely go much better in the uae or egypt because it 's [ normal behaviour for friends to hold hands ] ( http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9c07e4d71e31f932a35756c0a9639c8b63 ) . 
  sure , as long as gays do n't want to openly do any gay stuff , they 're also perfectly equal in all muslim countries . 
  and in some of them where * hundreds of millions * of muslims live , they have exactly the same status as in many non-muslim countries ( gray on the map ) . 
  i do n't see why we should generalise 1.6 billion muslims . 
  ok , fair enough . 
  ^ ( ( though it 's a * bit * weird that peace is just the other objective . 
  no , i mean several countries including the uk founded the efta just 3 years after the eec . 
  it had no ambitions beyond trade . 
  if what you say is true , why not go down that path ? 
  it 's ok , i just wrote the comment in one thread , but it could have been any other thread . 
  it was just funny to watch then , it 's still sort of funny now in the new context . 
  link ? 
  the problem with personal experience is that you can be in a personal bubble separated from the rest of society . 
  life in brasov is not life in voila . 
  anyway , perhaps a more accurate assesment comes from legal status : homosexuals have the same legal status in eastern europe as they have in turkey , bosnia , jordan , indonesia and more majority muslim countries : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_by_country_or_territory#/media/file:world_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg not that it matters too much , until a few decades ago , most of europe would n't have been near the blue categories either . 
  why did the netherlands found an organisation with the express purpose to be much more than a marketplace without the uk in the first place ? 
  [ called it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2e231g/english_reject_alex_salmonds_plan_to_share_the/cjvfymw ) :-)  ( ... ) as a european from the mainland witnessing all the huffy vindictiveness in this thread , i do want to express just how much i 'm looking forward to your eu referendum . 
  i can only imagine how delicious the discussions will be . 
   i better prepare some strategic popcorn reserves .
