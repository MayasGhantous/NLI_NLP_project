  lately ? 
  yeah , eastern europe is * such * a paradise for gays . 
  muslims would really fuck things up for them . 
  i ca n't stand this show . 
  it 's trying to copy the daily show but it just is n't anywhere near as good as the original . 
  stewart 's people would never bash an entire country for a whole segment . 
  political groups , corporations or even individuals , sure , but not groups like that . 
  would you consider it sensible if someone went to , say , / r/ukpolitics and formed their opinion on the uk there ? 
  according to eurobarometer 81 , the french think their country would not face a better future outside the eu ( about 65 % :25 % ) . 
  across the whole eu , the numbers are about 56 % :31 % . 
  there 's no significant change compared to eurobarometer 80 . 
  if we take the numbers for wrong answers from [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/341y0i/29_of_the_european_people_think_the_sun_revolves/cqqiua1 ) as a baseline for being completely out of touch , i think it 's safe to say that the supporters outnumber opponents by a huge margin and that the whole thing is here to stay for quite a while . 
  see more here : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_publ_en.pdf , page 85 . edit : also , much simpler ( duh ) , there 's a poll asking for the future of the eu : http://i.imgur.com/xc2zrk0.png, 
  sorry , i was unclear . 
  it 's just about clearing houses . 
  i think the problem is that the eurozone already tried to force euro-denominated business to be conducted within its jurisdiction and only the ecj protected london because there must not be discrimination between eu members . 
  outside the eu , london is not entitled to the ecj 's protection . 
  to be fair , at least ireland was basically forced to take its opt-outs or lose the common travel area . 
  you did n't really have a choice . 
  were the uk to leave the eu and ireland to stay , this would probably all be reversed because you could n't maintain the cta across an eu external border anyway . 
  de gaulle wanted europe to be its own power , separate from and independent of the ussr and the usa and he considered the uk an american trojan horse . 
  [ another vaguely related comment by me ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/37xy2v/rupert_murdoch_does_uturn_on_europe_and_says_we/crqr0eu?context=3 ) . 
  [ mfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrku4-zhhl8&amp;t=11s ) people ca n't distinguish between a famous gaul and a typographic symbol, 
  gee , be a little more understanding . 
  do you know how swamped they are over there ? 
  eastern europe is way too busy asking for more euromonies and solidarity vs russia to help out with humanitarian efforts for people who are way worse off . 
  wonder if you 'd accept a similar answer from italy when estonia feels the bear 's breath in its neck . 
  some media outlets push that idea and apparently , if you throw shit long enough , some of it will stick . 
   are you serious ? 
  that would make sense if politicians and civil servants are experts and can always be trusted to make the right descisions . 
  they are not . 
  i mean how can a former `` expert '' in familiy affairs suddenly become the minister of defense ? 
  not to defend vdl , but a minister is more of a manager and has experts for the details . 
  that 's why i wrote politicians * and * civil servants . 
  vdl has literally an army of civil servants and other consultants at her disposal . 
   so you are saying the public should be treated as dumb voting cattle ? 
  why voting at all then ? 
  this is the basis for all further descisions made . 
  i did not say that . 
  i merely acknowledged that our society is based on separation of labour . 
  a voter can judge the personal outcome of a policy , but that 's not the same as coming up with the best policy ( funnily , this probably falls under n ! = np ) . 
  the same way everyone can choose a doctor that suits him , but we still have to go to the doctor when we are sick . 
  an average person lives their life and is perhaps an expert at whatever it is they do . 
  but their day has only 24 hours , they ca n't possibly compete with someone whose job it is to govern when it comes to that . 
   all descisions should always base on the public opinion . 
  this is the very definition of democracy . 
  no , democracy is an abstract concept describing the general rule of the people . 
  it makes no statement on day to day operations or single decisions . 
  what you describe is more like ochlocracy , rule of the mob . 
  if you pick up an introductory book on democracy theory you will see immediately how many institutions exist to limit the majority 's influence . 
  parliaments to keep the mob from direct decision-making , upper chambers of parliament to further dilute that power , courts and constitutions to impose additional boundaries , and so on and so forth . 
  we have representative democracy because we acknowledge that separation of labour is the basis of our society . 
  politicians and civil servants who deal with these things all day long know more about what they are doing than an elusive public . 
  they should n't govern according to poll numbers -- the average person focusses on doing * their * jobs and living their lives and ca n't possibly be more qualified to make difficult strategic decisions . 
  it applies only to ordinary employees , not people who sort of work for themselves . 
  we 're talking about a hypothetical federal european state , not today 's eu -- so why bring up today 's eu ? 
  it 's not the point . 
  of course , today 's eu is n't there where it should be yet , that 's no surprise . 
  but if the federal government were not elected through the federal institutions , i.e. 
  its own parliament or equivalent , then the whole thing would n't * be * a federation . 
  the german government is not appointed by its states . 
  the same goes for the american government , the indian government , the australian , canadian , swiss , austrian governments . 
  a hypothetical european one would n't suddenly be different . 
  having said that , * the * top position in commission is voted nowadays , its president . 
  juncker got the job because his group came out on top after the last elections . 
  the odd thing is , other than in ordinary governments , the president ( i.e. 
  `` prime minister '' ) does n't choose his commissioners ( `` ministers '' ) but gets them assigned by the member states . 
  the whole package then must pass a confirmation vote in parliament . 
  that `` not choosing his own government '' thing is unusual , but the `` not voting for every commissioner '' is again also kind of normal -- we all never vote for individual government ministers in our home countries . 
  so let 's have no childcare , then we can have no children at all and do n't need to worry !, 
  seriously though , it 's not like the countries with childcare have terrible problems . 
  just give people the option and that 's it . 
  people can still decide not to make use of the offer . 
  ok , you 're right , sometimes she also lies and does something completely different :-), 
  i only * seem * is the important difference . 
  feel free to go through my history , you 'll see i 'm neither a single-issue poster nor gaming reddit in another way . 
  anyway . 
  there have been screenshots ( and of course the corresponding threads ) from stormfront and 4chan calling people to brigade subreddits , including this one . 
  additionally you can see new accounts whose sole comment and submisson history consists of agitation all the time , though the mods handle that very well . 
  this very thread was spawned by an account whose now-deleted comment claimed that european integration would be much further if we would n't have insane numbers of africans and muslims . 
  i responded with a gif because it was just * so * absurd . 
  i think you are completely right , i was just making it simpler to get the general point across : a ** substantial ** decrease in coherent german influence . 
  you can work on several in parallel . 
  if you look very closely , there do n't seem to be many bunnies at the northern coast of the black sea . 
  this . 
  she 's going to say nothing definitive until the very last moment and then things will go very fast , in whichever direction it is that seems more beneficial to her . 
  how many migrants are doing this ? 
  how much does it cost us ? 
  ( honest questions . ), 
  in the context of the wider discussion , i do n't think individual european countries are equal to the us . 
  if i ask you a specific question and you evade it , i 'm not going to waste more time in this thread . 
  your whole post is conjecture , generalised personal opinions and the one number you included , is false . 
  it 's 32:53 for : against according to eurobarometer 81 -- hardly out of reach for a good campaign . 
  anyway , the same eurobarometer paints a completely different picture of identity than you do , conveniently [ pictured here ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/europe-union-brexit-eurobarometer/ ) . 
  happens to the best . 
  no , it only carries that name for historical reasons . 
  i do n't know enough about reddit to dispute this but i believe it exceeds the current software 's abilities . 
  personally , i 'm okay with being an equal partner with the us , including perhaps things like ttip ( although i will withhold judgement until it 's finalised ) . 
   they share a history , a language a culture an identity . 
  we do n't .
