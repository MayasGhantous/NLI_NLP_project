  to a certain extent , we share all these things . 
  but for completeness , switzerland , canada or india are also federation with different languages and varying identities . 
  anyway , it 's still not a convincing point . 
  give me 200 years of `` european statehood '' and you 'll have your history , language , culture , identity . 
  chicken , egg . 
   there will be [ a coherent german voice ] unless we do not have proportionate representation , but every state recieves an equal amount of representation . 
  explain that please , in concrete terms . 
  explain to me how a coherent minority voice in the council and a completely fragmented share of german meps in parliament will form a coherent german voice to control everything . 
  the dutch pm is not talking about a federation , he 's talking about the real problems of not having one . 
  without it , france and/or germany can crush you precisely because they can still act in a coherent manner as national units . 
  break that coherence by moving certain powers to the federal level , and the problem disappears . 
  can you be more specific ? 
  what system could that be ? 
  this is a website with free registration . 
  `` the germans '' wo n't control shit because in a hypothetical federation there 's going to be one german representative in the council out of ~ 30-40 and ~ 100 german meps out of 700 + in parliament spread across several political groups , voting against each other . 
  there wo n't be a coherent german voice to control anything . 
  bavaria or nrw are n't controlling germany , texas or california are n't controlling the usa . 
  that 's just not how this works . 
  sure , but how else do you want to fight an organised group trying to capture the sub ? 
  look around us , there are only a couple hundred of active posters . 
  a small group can appear huge if it 's acting cleverly . 
  report button is your friend . 
  but yes , it 's really ridiculous . 
  the 2005 treaty is dead . 
  the lisbon treaty is a different one , even if it shares * some * things with the rejected one . 
  with 77 % yes , you could add no-voters all the way to 64 % turnout and still have it passed . 
  turnout did n't matter . 
   as the eu 's relative economic decline is likely to prove inexorable , even if the eurozone crisis should one day have been resolved , its capacity to arrest its declining world power will depend heavily on the extent to which it can -- in fact -- integrate more closely politically . 
  nah , i 'm sure we 'll be totally fine if we remain a divided bunch of small bickering countries . 
  everyone knows you ca n't lose self-determination except if you formally sign it away with a treaty . 
  and the spanish and luxembourger referenda resulted in a yes . 
  funny how rarely they get mentioned . 
  whatsapp told me there 'd be end to end encryption , how can they hand over anything ? 
  sounds fair . 
  almost too fair . 
  it 's as though the richer companies get no advantage at all . 
  thanks , that sucks if true . 
  maybe someone has some more reading material . 
  i 'm sure of all possible demands , a more complete market ( i.e. 
  `` more europe '' ) would be one of the easiest reform to achieve for cameron because it 's justified and fair . 
  do n't you think he just said that to keep credibility with some groups ? 
  i think it 's naive to believe politicians when they say things that can not be objectively falsified . 
  he can believe ( read : spin ) anything to be in the uk 's interest and then campaign to stay in . 
   faces too much opposition ( especially from germany ) can you explain more ? 
  there are , e.g. 
  the source is all over the picture . 
  the company 's logo is on the top right , url in the bottom left .

  probably , but i think they want money for that . 
  [ here 's an older map with numbers ] ( http://archiv.gfk-geomarketing.de/press/201112_population_density_europe_2011_2012.zip ) ( zipped !,

  young brits who lived in the uk generally satisfy the residency condition automatically , wo n't they ? 
   i just applied to a job in munich . 
  if you come here , you can pm me for a drink . 
  wonder if the variation in the former frg is a coincidence or somehow linked to the different powers . 
  those are just us monies for fusion research . 
  it 's not the same but similar around the world . 
  i do n't have a plot though , sorry . 
  yes , i 'm also hoping for some awakening once it 's up and running . 
  but perhaps there will be another kind of sputnik-moment when asian countries overtake europe . 
  they , especially the chinese , seem to take this more seriously than we or the americans do , even if they lag behind in terms of know-how . 
  that 's what i hear , too . 
  every cm ^ 2 of wall area will be precious . 
  i 'm not your buddy , pal . 
  oh , sorry if it sounded like that . 
  was n't my intention !, 
  i just wanted to clarify it for other readers . 
  you did n't hurt anything . 
  have a good evening !, 
  a better name for this position would have been chairman or speaker of the council . 
  why would he be elected in a popular vote ? 
  the position serves the council , it 's their problem , their choice . 
  no one ever complained about the president of the bundesrat not being elected by popular vote either . 
  uh , i 'm sorry , we really need the neutrons to breed new tritium . 
  well , not in iter , but in a hypothetical fusion power plant . 
  the hot cell facility apparently has [ about 130000 m ^ 3 volume ] ( https://www.iter.org/mach/hotcell ) . 
  i 'm afraid i 'm not directly involved in this work so i ca n't give you more than what they have on the site . 
  it would be a very big kickstarter . 
  here are [ some american numbers for some perspective ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sjh5r.jpg ) . 
  anyway , very very few people really work for iter directly . 
  so , no , i only work for a european lab that contributes to the general fusion effort . 
  you 're barking up the wrong tree and now it 's going to drop something on you :-)  the main problem is trying to hold the superheated plasma in such a small place at the temperatures ( ~ 100 million degrees ) that are needed for fusion to occur . 
  not that big of a problem , helical magnetic confinement fusion is an established principle . 
  conventional magnetic confinement is , however , limited to a certain maximum insulation above which all extra heating leads to stronger heat fluxes ( so-called critical gradients caused by turbulence above certain gradients ) , i.e. 
  a viable fusion reactor must exceed a minimum size . 
  that 's why iter is so big . 
  smaller devices like jt-60 in japan have shown to be able to output as much fusion power as they need in external heating ( q = 1 ) ; for values q  1 , the machines must be simply bigger . 
   the main barrier to a sustained reaction , other than the high cost of the electricity needed to heat the chamber , is finding a material that can withstand that much heat for more than a few seconds . 
  well , sort of . 
  you do n't want your fusion plasma touching anything because there is no material that would withstand it ( and because it would make your plasma dirty and reduce performance ) . 
  for that reason , [ the magnetic fields are specifically shaped to create a barrier ] ( https://www.euro-fusion.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fig05.jpg ) between the hot fusion plasma and the outer regions leading to the walls , the separatrix . 
  the most critical region is below the x-point , the so-called divertor , which is kind of an exhaust pipe for the reactor . 
  in an ignited plasma , 4/5 of the fusion power reach the walls isotropically in the form of neutrons , but 1/5 goes towards the helium ash , and that has to go down to the divertor . 
  for a 1 gw_el reactor , that 's several hundred mw of heat you need to channel through an area only a few square metres big , but materials can only survive up to maybe 15 mw/m ^ 2 over longer intervals . 
  thus , you must find a way to `` detach '' your plasma from the divertor plates and have it radiate as much power away before hitting them . 
  that 's done , for example , using neutral gas in the divertor that can be excited and sends out light in all directions . 
  anyway , you do n't want to exchange your divertor every 2 weeks , so a lot of work goes into making it more durable , either through novel divertor concepts or by mastering the plasma such that it becomes less aggressive . 
  the other big challenge is to convert every neutron out of d+t -  he + n into a new t , but that 's in the sights , too . 
   we are making progress definetly , but its still going to be a while before we have fusion reactors .
