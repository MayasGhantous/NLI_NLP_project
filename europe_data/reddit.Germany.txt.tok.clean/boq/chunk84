  900 people will overwhelm estonia ? 
  wow . 
  the accepted ( ! ), 
  refugees meet the internationally agreed criteria . 
  if they applied in the east , they would have to be granted asylum there , too . 
  these countries do n't attract that many refugees ( yet ) though , so it would be a nice sign of solidarity to take some weight of their western friends ' shoulders . 
  considering how much they have done for them through the eu , it 's really not much to ask . 
  were talking about 1 refugee for tens of thousands of local residents , so hardly an impossible amount . 
  the current discussion is about quotas to distribute them across europe , so it would likely reduce the number of people hosted in bavaria ( not that i believe this to be necessary ) . 
  uh , yes , i agree . 
  i was just pointing out that 2700:1 across europe is absolutely doable . 
  so , 1 refugee for every 2700 europeans . 
  really no big deal . 
  i 'm not following . 
  if you 're assigned to a region , that 's it . 
  that 's where you get benefits , that 's where police will bring you back to as long as you 're supposed to be there . 
  what do differences between paces have to do with it ? 
  we can not reach perfect economic equilibrium , it 's just not possible , so , yes . 
  this is what will happen eventually , some regions will be perpetual contributors , some will be perpetual recipients . 
  it 's the same in every ( ! ), 
  country , not just the us . 
  refugees in germany can be confined to individual states . 
  if germany can do that since forever , europe wo n't have trouble either . 
  the entire debate is about distributing them across europe , i.e. 
  preventing just that . 
  even if they were to cluster in certain areas , the vast vast vast majority of any country will not be affected at all . 
  it 's not a big challenge , full stop . 
  add up the numbers in the chart , it 's around half a million . 
  even if 100 % of applications were accepted , it would be only 1 asylum seeker per 1000 eu citizens per year . 
  this is not a problem by any measure . 
  at all . 
  no community of 1000 people has a problem with hosting 1 additional person per year . 
  that 's not for you to decide . 
  this is about legitimate asylum seekers , no matter how hard some try to make it about something else . 
  unfortunately i 'm on my phone ( and will be for some time ) and the page does n't load . 
  but that 's not important because i have the gist of it in my head : divide the net energy by the net profit , you 'll get a price per kwh . 
  notice how that price will be lower than renewable power generation costs per kwh , i.e. 
  germany is exporting subsidised electricity at a loss . 
  out of curiosity , have you ever bothered checking how much profit germany makes from these net exports ? 
  just because millions of eastern europeans ( like me ) emigrated to the west and their countries gladly took billions in aid from there does n't mean they have to adopt any western values or help their partners when they request it . 
  this is about local elections . 
  i 'm sure a 16year old can grasp the complexities of local elections just fine . 
  i think what you say is broadly correct but i also think you needlessly construct a false dichotomy . 
  you can choose a certain kind of immigrants , but you can also shape migration to avoid ghettoisation etc. 
  i 'm not admiring singapore , but i 'm sure we could learn a thing from them in this regard . 
  a [ legend from the region around salzburg/berchtesgaden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untersberg#legend ) : either charlemagne or frederick barbarossa sleep in a secret hall in the mountain `` untersberg '' until the realm is in dire distress and the ravens no longer fly or his beard has grown around the table thrice . 
  then , as the end of the world is nigh , he will wake up and lead the final battle between good and evil near the pear tree on the walserfeld . 
  the tree , the field and the mountain are real , i would n't bet money on the rest . 
  there is a good reason , imagination and hysteria . 
  the biggest anti-muslim/immigrant sentiments are found in areas with the lowest number of these immigrants . 
  to [ quote myself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2vy8gg/in_view_of_the_current_mass_exodus_from_kosovo/com240h?context=3 ) :  oh , it depends on what you are looking for specifically . 
  the easiest way is to compare election results with foreign population share because foreigners ca n't vote , so you automatically have them subtracted from the election result . 
   for example , the [ result of the early 2014 swiss immigration cap referendum ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/anti-einwanderungsinitiative_2014.svg/2000px-anti-einwanderungsinitiative_2014.svg.png ) vs. [ foreigner population share ] ( http://www.atlas.bfs.admin.ch/maps/13/map/mapidonly/17083_de.html ) . 
   or [ this reddit post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/scotland/comments/2nsowh/story_thank_you_scotland_youre_fantastic/cmgve98 ) compares ukip support with immigrant distribution . 
   or [ afd election results ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/btw13_afd_zweit_endgueltig.svg/2000px-btw13_afd_zweit_endgueltig.svg.png ) vs. [ immigrant population in germany ] ( http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/nachrichten/interaktive-karte-auslaender-in-deutschland/8282382.html ) . 
   there 's more actual correlation between anti-immigrant sentiment and low economic status , but i 'm too lazy to look up numbers for that now . 
   just have a look at these statistics that 's the point , statistics do n't prove any of these things . 
  the proponents of this position either do n't understand statistics or misrepresent the numbers on purpose ( see [ simpon 's paradox ] ( https://andipopp.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/statistics-youre-doing-it-wrong/#simpson ) ) . 
  is n't that one run by americans ? 
  [ most ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ), 
  it has done so in the past . 
  sociologist know that people come and go if they expect to be let in again at some point in the future . 
  the money they can earn in the tourist season or during harvest or whatever it is they do is worth much much more back home -- which * is * still their home . 
  they can build a house or start a business . 
  letting in migrant workers temporarily might be one of the best forms of development aid there is because it bypasses corrupt governments and goes directly to industrious people . 
  from one nightly to the next you get small deltas . 
  maybe for a day or two , even , i 'm not sure . 
  but beyond that , it 's only full updates . 
  personally , the 90 mb updates have n't bothered me so i never looked into it in-depth . 
  e10s is already very close to release-worthiness . 
  i have no problems with it any more , not even with multiple content processes . 
  you 'll like it . 
  ( also integrates well with firefox on android . ), 
  e10s is amazing , as far as i can tell . 
  my firefox nightly is really fast , responsive and stable , even or especially with multiple content processes . 
   `` the terrorists did not win , '' luz told les inrockuptibles . 
   `` they will have won if the whole of france continues to be scared , '' he added , accusing the far-right national front of trying to stir up fear in the wake of the attacks . 
  maybe i have been unclear . 
  no one says we should encourage human trafficking and taking risks . 
  we can open legal paths for application right there where it 's needed . 
  this will help exactly the people that ask for that help until they can return home . 
  during the balkan wars , over half a million people fled to germany . 
  most went home when the wars ended . 
  these refugees want to go home again , too . 
  we europeans not the only ones attached to our homes . 
  you know , there was an article a few days ago in a newspaper here , interview with a sociologist . 
  talked about unintended consequences . 
  how trying to make europe into a fortress actually made things worse ( with regards to regular migration ) : people used to come , work a bit in agriculture or sell stuff to tourists or whatever , and go back home again , then maybe come back next year when harvest or holidays came again . 
  took home peanuts for us but enough to build a good life back home , maybe start a business or something . 
  now that you can barely come in , everyone who makes it to europe tries his damned best to stay here , because they ca n't be sure they 'll be able to come to europe again . 
  that all leads to more of the stuff we both do n't like . 
  point is , on the overwhelming majority of people 's priority lists there is safety and home really close to the top and for some money is somewhere below the other two . 
  we can use this for everyone 's benefit , but not if we act crude and dumb . 
  it 's late for me . 
  good night . 
  oh , ok . well , obviously fixing problems at their source is preferrable to treating symptoms . 
  but both are n't mutually exclusive either . 
  economic impact , social cohesion , crime ... one might get the idea we are talking about millions and millions of people . 
  i 've used the gdp of germany and estonia to calculate how many refugees would have to be housed by estonia to have the same proportional impact : 260 .
