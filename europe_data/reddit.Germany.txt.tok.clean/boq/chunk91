  well , that 's a bit harsh . 
  the tories left the epp so juncker had no one to visit during the campaign ( if we forget the small ukepp in london for a moment ) . 
  schulz was really asked by labour not to come , and i guess he did what they told him to . 
  i would n't fault the entire country because their parties made some questionable calls . 
  i 'm not sure what we are fighting about . 
  not really , the southern-most is from rome , the northern-most from south-tyrol . 
  but i understand that there are varying opinions of what constitutes the italian `` south '' ;-), 
  well , the parent comment wrote about being relaxed with time , i.e. 
  not punctual . 
  at least my italian colleagues fit that stereotype and they also acknowledge it . 
  equally , they are more comfortable with , let 's say , bending some rules . 
  perhaps you are thinking more about being stressed or whatever , but in my experience that has more to do with where you live . 
  people in the city are stressed out everywhere , people in rural areas are more relaxed , again everywhere . 
  that 's relative ;-), 
  i will try to capture the meaning as i have understood it . 
  * inhibition of taking on a leading role caused by post-war pacifist attitudes * populism most often found in bars caused by the insecurity of the euro crisis * the odd surfacing of patriotism because of the world cup victory * the excellence of the mid-sized companies dominating niches that make them world champions in terms of exports * the excess of speed limits due to loads of slowly developing ( because of cost-cutting ) construction sites, 
  many people in this subreddit suffer from status quo bias and ca n't imagine anything moving ahead while another sizeable part has its heads in the clouds , dreaming about a mighty superpower-eu that 's just around the corner . 
  you get used to it after a while . 
  i like how you painted investors offering credit as perpetrators and the people who willingly take on that credit as their victims . 
  at the moment it really is the size that 's needed . 
  the new experiment under construction in france , iter , should be large enough to extract net energy . 
  i 'm on my phone , so i hope the statement by two directors from my institute will suffice : https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3787558/cfr, 
  i 'm in the netherlands right now , no weissw\u00fcrst in sight , i 'm afraid . 
  on my way home from a conference on fusion ( and other things ) , actually , so if anyone has questions , i 'd do my best to try to answer them . 
  slow compromise has always been the way ahead around the eu , even when some would prefer decisive leaps ahead . 
  you can simply limit the no-roaming-charge-phase to a few days at a time ( and then a few weeks and so on ) if you think you need to prevent the scenario you are describing . 
  no swede will fly to romania every few days or weeks to reset the charges , but `` legitimate `` use when traveling would still be possible . 
  countries do n't agree , or really do anything , because they are not persons . 
  persons have opinions , not countries . 
  there are danes who lean towards one policy , and danes who lean towards another . 
  the same is true for every state . 
  what you want is to force every person into the majority opinion of their country , but that 's just a cheap trick to turn this into an us-vs-them situation . 
  let all europeans decide together on the matters that affect them all , without artificial national voting blocks . 
   how media works within most of the eu democracies . 
  it 's unfortunate that you had to qualify this with `` most of '' . 
  hey can you hook me up with one of them sweet astroturfing jobs ? 
  ca n't believe i 've been doing this for free the whole time ... 
  i did n't downvote you , but op has clearly shown that whatever impression may have been created or not created is completely irrelevant . 
  this is because all actions or announcements that may have caused said impression came after the number of arrivals exploded , which both eurostat and unhcr numbers show ( the latter being linked by someone else in this thread ) . 
  the discussion is all but entirely moot . 
  why is that ? 
  are n't they taught where the terms come from ? 
  for third readers and completeness 's sake : left and right come from the french revolution and refer to republicans who believed in equality sitting in the left part of parliament and monarchists who favoured a hierarchy sitting on the right . 
  obviously someone can not be a leftist if they do n't believe in equality . 
  putting one group ahead of another is a clear hierarchy , even if socialist elements are applied to the favoured group . 
  naturally , national socialism is thus , fundamentally , a right-wing ideology , because it elevates one `` nation '' above others . 
  that 's all true in a way but as far as the un are concerned the individual us states are n't un member states whereas the individual eu member states are . 
  until something changes in that regard , the un will have no choice but to consider them as separate entities . 
  the eu is a new thing and it will inevitably cause artefacts in the traditional approaches of quantifying world affairs . 
  the original submission is an article * about * an op-ed by the french and german central bank chiefs . 
  i have given you a link to the * original * op-ed and even translated the specific part where they say that giving more power to the european level * requires * more european democracy . 
  you can also find this paragraph in a [ machine translation ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=de&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/euro-raum-europa-braucht-ein-gemeinsames-finanzministerium-1.2852586-2&amp;usg=alkjrhgz3djwjsei3649hscbwut1rjyocq ) :  to this end , the euro countries will naturally have a considerable degree of sovereignty and powers to the european level , which would require greater democratic accountability at no point does anyone say that giving more power to something will make it more democratic . 
  they are describing it as a requirement , not a consequence . 
  it 's no wonder that you ca n't follow the thought process you describe because no one had that thought process in the first place . 
  what you are decrying is not actually written in the article and what you demand , more democracy , is , in fact , mentioned in the actual [ op-ed ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/euro-raum-europa-braucht-ein-gemeinsames-finanzministerium-1.2852586 ) . 
  =  for this purpose the euro-countries would naturally have to transfer sovereignty and authorities to a substantial degree to the european level , which in turn would require greater democratic accountability . 
  their alternative is to harden the fiscal rules to ensure that every country is entirely responsible for their own finances . 
  they probably refer to the automatism recently floated by schaeuble in which a breaking of european fiscal rules would automatically trigger a haircut for a country . 
  the expected outcome is that investors will begin to price that risk into the respective country 's bonds and thus prevent any bubbles . 
  while i prefer option 1 , i do recognise that this franco-german-engine-approach may alienate the other member states and that they should reconsider it to some extent . 
   ` plenty of space in sweden for refugees ' http://www.thelocal.se/20141207/no-home-for-swe-dems-on-centre-right-reinfeldt about refugees , not general migration . 
   http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.576/former-swedish-pm-sweden-belongs-to-the-immigrants-not-the-swedes.html whether or not he even said that , he was n't a government official any more . 
   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/11992479/how-sweden-the-most-open-country-in-the-world-was-overwhelmed-by-migrants.html an editorial , again no official government release . 
   http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.1238/swedish-pm-no-limit-on-mass-immigration-to-sweden.html i could not find a second source of the pm saying this in any reputable publication so i 'm going to assume that he never said that . 
   http://www.voanews.com/content/migrant-surge-tests-sweden-open-door-policy/2976002.html again some kind of fluff piece . 
   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/angela-merkel-rejects-criticism-open-door-refugee-policy-germany again this is about refugees that have already made it to europe . 
   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nearly-half-of-germans-say-angela-merkels-refugee-policy-is-wrong-a6689966.html what do poll numbers have to do with any of this ? 
   http://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-welcoming-refugees-right-thing-to-do/ again no sign of the alleged statement . 
  instead it includes sentences like `` merkel called for the deportations of those asylum seekers whose applications in germany had been denied . '', 
   https://www.wort.lu/en/politics/zdf-german-tv-interview-jean-asselborn-ashamed-of-hungary-pm-orban-55e968910c88b46a8ce5f66a and what does a politician from luxembourg commenting on the hungarian government have to do with sweden and germany ? 
  -- summary : 8 out of 9 links contain nothing that could support the statement `` come here all immigrants and poor people of the world to europe , we can take everyone '' ( your words from before ) and the one post that suggests that the swedish pm did say something like this appears nowhere else , so it 's most certainly inaccurate . 
  i thus maintain my previous assessment . 
  -- i do n't want to antagonise you needlessly . 
  having said that , you are lying to yourself by twisting their words around to fit your preconceived ideas . 
  maybe that way you can win an argument against an ignorant opponent , but you 'll still not be in the right . 
  if you listen to these government 's actual statements , then they have always been fairly consistent : * secure the external border so we know who comes in * award asylum to genuine applicants as mandated by our laws and deport those that are n't eligible * since summer , they have been pushing for more burden sharing to relieve the first schengen countries * on top of that , acknowledging the lack of progress regarding the previous point , the german government temporarily suspended dublin deportations for syrians on aug 25th in order to relieve the first schengen countries it 's weird that i 'm defending these politicians here because i say this as someone who 's not their biggest fan and has never voted for any of them . 
  feel free to show me an official statement amounting to  come here all immigrants and poor people of the world to europe , we can take everyone while i wait here in the real world . 
  [ here are the number of arrivals in europe per month ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_time_asylum_applicants,_eu-28,_january_2014_%e2%80%93_september_2015.png ) . 
  note how the numbers begin to rise explosively in early summer of 2015 when the official position of the german government was `` not our problem , first schengen countries must enforce schengen rules '' . 
  only on the 25th of august when budapest train station looked like [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=keleti&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1379&amp;bih=1098&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3a1%2ccd_min%3a10.08.2015%2ccd_max%3a25.08.2015&amp;tbm=isch#q=keleti&amp;safe=off&amp;tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:10.08.2015,cd_max:25.08.2015&amp;tbm=isch&amp;pws=0 ) did the german government basically say `` ok , since the first schengen countries obviously ca n't cope , we will , for the time being , not deport registered syrians back to them so we can sort this all out in the meantime '' . 
  [ now , do note how the numbers flatten off in september , remain at their september value in october , and drop in november ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=migr_asyappctzm&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view ) , which is exactly the same behaviour as in 2014 and 2013 , i.e. 
  reduction in arrivals in winter . 
  in other words , what made the numbers swell already happened long before the german government said anything that someone might spin into the statement quoted above . 
  in fact , it has more to do with the un and wfp having to cut their aid to syria 's neighbours in late 2014 and early 2015 , which ultimately pushed people to move on . 
  i 'm sorry to say it but comments like this one are what churchill meant when he spoke about a chat with the average voter being the best argument against democracy . 
  literally every checkable factual statement in it is incorrect . 
  neither sweden nor germany did anything of the sort and at least the german government has even offered sending personnel to help police the external border -- an offer only greece has recently begun to accept . 
  here 's an overview over the rule of law framework ( rolf ) : http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-14-237_en.htm no , it has n't : http://www.votewatch.eu/blog/ep-criticises-the-hungarian-government-but-fails-to-reach-consensus-to-request-activation-of-rule-of-law-clause/ however , hungary has been subject to a regular infringement procedure and seems to have dialled back some of its most criticised changes : http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-13-1112_en.htm i ca n't say whether that was enough and that the rolf does n't need to be applied to hungary anymore or whether epp is protecting orban because he was smart enough to stay in it . 
  either way , even if there were evidence of misconduct with regard to the hungarian situation , that would not be a justification for letting everyone else off the hook as well . 
   as we both know , the current hungarian government has not been squeaky clean with the rule of law : but what has the eu done ? 
  it has done nothing , because it knows there is no more euphile hungarian government waiting in the wings . 
  if the eu gives the hungarian government a pass , i 'm afraid it has to do the same with poland . 
  i , too , believed that at first . 
  but no , as it turns out , it 's because the mechanism to censure ( that is used now ) was only created in 2014 * in response * to the hungarian development . 
  before that , there was only the nuclear option , suspending a country 's voting rights without any prelude . 
  that was deemed to extreme back then so member states decided to add some way to gradually escalate . 
  it 's beyond me how you could have let yourself believe the false claims that the previous governments have done the same things . 
  how come this government had to change laws if the former governments had already done the same things ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  polish redditors in this sub as well as the polish ones have blown giant holes into the pis narrative .
