  clearly what pis is doing goes beyond whatever has come before that . 
  they only had 38 % of the vote during the election and now they are below 30 % . 
  that is not a mandate to enact the changes they are enacting . 
  last but not least , even lech walesa criticised them openly and pretty harshly . 
  are you calling him a brussels-stooge , too ? 
  honestly , i think i know why you have come to this conclusion : i think * you * are letting yourself be blinded by * your * ideology and that is why i maintain my claim that it is backwards . 
  you think pis is some kind of fighter for national democracy like yourself , but they are not . 
  they are subduing polish national democracy , but because they are doing it in opposition to the boogeyman you share , you give them a pass . 
  the previous government has not been exactly eu-friendly . 
  they did n't rush into the euro . 
  they did n't offer to host refugees by themselves . 
  in fact , they did very little that would brand them as friends of the eu . 
  and yet , po did n't do what pis is doing and for that reason , the rest of the eu did n't bother them . 
  this is different and i 'm glad europe is not letting it slide . 
  finally , i have said it again and again : i do n't like the current state of european integration and i will not defend it nor accept the blame for it . 
  a deeper eu with the necessary authority to combat asymmetric economic shocks would not suffer from this malaise . 
  but let 's not get into this again . 
  this is n't about telling poland who should govern it , but about the rule of law . 
  poland is a member of the eu and that comes with certain rules . 
  if the polish government breaks them , then it should be censured according to the rules it signed up to . 
  it is telling that you consider your backwards nationalist ideology more important than the rule of law . 
  how disappointing , especially considering that i 'm sure you already knew * everything * i just wrote and still decided to write that nonsense . 
  thankfully , the uk government , as people like you have pointed out often , may not be a big fan of european integration , but it does n't simply break rules it is n't fond of . 
  once they really are the same , the parades will fizzle out . 
  it 's not like such poses are homosexual [ day-to-day behaviour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb-jzsyhwsc ) . 
  clarkson would make ridiculous arguments but not in a direction that pis would like :  i long for a time when i think of myself as a european first and an englishman second . 
  i crave a united states of europe with one currency , one army and one type of plug . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2pg7dg/top_gears_jeremy_clarkson_reveals_himself_as_an/ ) ), 
  we 're going to have quite a problem when the system blows up around us , so it would be prudent to change our ways before that happens . 
  cooperation reads nice and all but it breaks down at the first conflict of interest . 
  then you need a system to resolve conflicts . 
  with fewer parties this can certainly be done on an ad-hoc basis , but with dozens of parties this approach is n't viable . 
  then the problems just fester and the situation deteriorates and tensions rise until europe is back to being the powder-keg it once was . 
  no , thanks , i 'd rather give up the illusion that the nations of this cramped continent can act as if they each had a continent to themselves . 
  well . 
  months and centuries do sound quite off-putting for such an endeavour . 
  moment of inertia of a hollow cylinder with mass * m * and inner radius * ri * and outer radius * ra * , both of which are basically * r * as the shell is very thin : i = 1/2 * m * ( ra ^ 2 + ri ^ 2 ) = ~ m * r ^ 2 ( ra ~ = ri ~ = r ) torque from an engine at radius * r * with force * f * must equal the angular rotation * omega * times the moment of inertia * i * after a time * dt * : m = r * f = i * a = i * omega/dt -  dt = m * omega * r/f with m = v * rho ~ = 2 * pi * r * dr * width * rho ~ = 2.2 e7kg with mass density * rho * of iron and a radius of * r * = 225m , thickness * dr * = 0.1 m , * width * = 20m . 
  thus : dt = 2.2 e7kg * 4pi/min * 225m / f dt ( f = 14kn ) = 21h dt ( f = 7770kn ) = 2min i have n't double checked but the units match in the end so it ca n't be that wrong . 
  a weak ion engine should suffice to spin up such an installation in a couple of weeks or months . 
  also it does n't have to be 1g , so we do n't need to be that fast anyway . 
  i should get back to my thesis , i think . 
  the stance was acknowledged . 
  the agreement that was reached included many demands from eastern european capitals , for example tightening the external border controls to weed out illegitimate migrants as well as supporting refugees in europe 's neighbourhood to discourage them from moving further towards the eu . 
  it still requires some procedure to handle legitimate asylum seekers that end up knocking on europe 's door . 
  eastern european capitals have not presented a proper plan for that aspect of the issue beyond useless and repulsive 1930s rhetoric . 
  a member state like , say , italy is expected to hand out subsidies to the very same eastern european capitals , and to support prolonged sanctions against russia that are arguably not in its interest . 
  what does it get in return the one time it asks for their support ? 
  to paint eastern europe as some kind of victim in this whole affair is nothing short of absurd . 
  almost nothing was asked of it and even that was apparently too much . 
  being eastern european myself , i have personally profited from the eastward expansion of the eu . 
  by now , i 'm no longer sure it was an unequivocally good idea . 
  well , it looks like a banana when you look at its cross section and physicists are simple people . 
  just because i abbreviate descriptions to be more striking and faster to write does n't mean i do n't understand the complexity behind the concepts they stand for . 
  you 're not as smart as you think you are and are definitely not in a position to attempt to put down others . 
  i have n't contradicted myself . 
  the first part of my post emphasised that people were fighting for years before we arrived at this point with only little to show for . 
  so , the general argument of the person i responded to is not accurate -- syrians did n't just run out of ideas without ever trying something . 
  the second part discusses why it 's understandable that they are now cutting their losses and leaving , emphasising that the only faction that * might * be considered `` the good guys '' is now also getting pummelled by russian air strikes , i.e. 
  that the chances for victory are even slimmer than they were a while ago . 
  alas , if you do n't care , i do n't care either . 
  what i wrote is perfectly understandable . 
  i will not indulge you for long if you twist it into something else just to post something . 
  a ) there is a difference between * moderate opposition * , i.e. 
  fighting moderates , and the general population . 
  it is no surprise that , by now , most non-government fighters are not moderates . 
  moderation rarely evokes as much passion as fanatism . 
  b ) if you combine sentences from different ends of a post into one , you do n't have to be surprised if they do n't make sense any more . 
  of course , before the russians started to help out , assads own air force did the same job just fine . 
  however , at the end of the day , that is all not important , because all i need for my argument is the fact that the moderate opposition , the only group perhaps worth fighting for , are nowhere close to winning . 
  so again , fight for whom ? 
  the well-meaning losers , the dictator , or the fanatics ? 
  it 's not quite fighting for the bundeswehr . 
  i 'm from eastern europe myself , and there is no value in lying to ourselves . 
  do n't know where you see arrogance in telling it how it is/was . 
  an interesting perspective that borders on historical revisionism . 
  the a10 have never been in a position to push anything on the eu15 that the latter did n't want themselves , especially not in the chaotic early 90s when the path towards integrating eastern europe was set out . 
  not to mention the disparities between the a10 that would have made finding common interests extraordinarily hard . 
  back on topic : the commission will begin infringement procedures after a while and in the end , the court will enforce the legally passed quotas . 
  regarding your first paragraph : yes , of course , but if it 's such a wonderful deal for the net contributors , they should be happy to expand the eu as far as they possibly can . 
  there are several countries trying to get in right now , and the eu 's not in a rush to admit them to the club , especially because the net contributors are stepping on the brakes . 
  maybe it 's not as wonderful a deal for them as you are suggesting it is . 
  regarding your second paragraph : when the accession process was started , poland and the rest of ee was absolutely not in such a position and we could have chosen to foster dependence rather than equality . 
  and finally , that some italian shareholders or execs might benefit is one thing , but again , how does italy and the average italian benefit ? 
  and if they do , do they benefit to the tune of billions per year ? 
  especially , do they still come out in the black after curtailing their trade with russia on behalf of eastern europe ? 
  i mean , i 'm in favour of sanctioning russia for its actions , but i 'm also in favour of the polish government showing some solidarity , too . 
  the eu is the forum in which europe coordinates its stance against russia and member states like italy or france were not too eager to make eastern europe 's problems with russia their own problems , but they still did make them their own problems . 
  call that what you will . 
  i 'm not sure who you 're quoting when you put `` free money '' in your post , because i did n't write that . 
  having said that , if it 's such a great deal for the net contributors , why do n't they extend it to as many countries as possible , everywhere ? 
  perhaps it 's not * quite * that simple . 
  at the end of the day , everyone wins something . 
  except one side also gains hefty subsidies to help them get closer to the other side 's level . 
  that part simply can not be spun away . 
   this argument again ... it 's not `` free money '' . 
  western business have access to our market , cheaper workforce , and they have fat profits from it . 
  take a look at the world : western business can exploit countries just fine without anyone giving any special subsidies . 
  for example , americans do n't subsidise mexico , they do n't give them easy ways to migrate into america , but they do like putting factories there ( among other things ... ) . 
   fiat have their manufactury in poland on very favourable conditions ? 
  one of the biggest polish banks is owned by unicredit and what does * italy * get out of this ?
