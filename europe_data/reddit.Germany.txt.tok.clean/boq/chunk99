  i do n't consider the uk `` foreign . '', 
  they 're not your own , hence `` global . `` then europe gives weight . 
  because you get to influence europe through direct and indirect elections . 
  china , not so much . 
  australia is moving closer towards america and other friends in the area . 
  first of all , i 'm not sure how valuable arguments are that basically go like `` it 's okay today , so it 'll be okay in 40 years . '', 
  then , it 's not about an empire . 
  it 's just that more and more policy is global , be it about the environment or trade or `` intellectual property . '', 
  the emerging powers will eventually be influential enough to dominate global policy in these areas . 
  europe 's interests , however , are comparably similar , so it could rather easily create a unified bloc to amplify its own influence in said negotiations etc. 
  is it smart to not do that and just hope that future decisions will not be against europe 's interests ? 
  switzerland has blood on its wealth , so it 's okay . 
  honest question : do we already know how recapitalisation is supposed to work ? 
  how do we know it 's not going to be how you describe ? 
  i 'd like that , too . 
  actually ... no , i do n't . 
  thanks for reminding me how great it is at work :-), 
   denials right on schedule ... ransquawk : reports of finland threatening to quit the euro are false according to the finance ministry https://twitter.com/openeurope/status/221208634204504065, 
  let 's sit back and wait for 160 economists from the other side of the aisle to demand the exact opposite . 
  economics . 
  it 's not really science . 
  daniel craig is a brit . 
  this should be on the image . 
  `` genocide free for xx years . '', 
  we 'll steal the stars ' fire . 
  this time for real . 
  and no chaining one of us to a mountain !, 
   of course i do n't understand any of this , but the impression i 'm getting from having a quick glance at the concepts is that stellarators are somewhat more elegant ( for once not talking about the aesthetic value here ) . 
  is that about right , at least as a gross oversimplification and in the sense that there would be less components and possibly better stability ? 
  could you conceivably power a ship with one of those two designs ? 
  the reason why you need computational power to master stellarators is because their magnetic field geometry ( and thus the entire plasma ) can not be analytically solved . 
  it 's way more complicated than the simple tokamak equilibrium . 
  that 's why numerical solutions are needed . 
  to be clear , tokamaks also need numerical analysis , although only to solve higher-level problems . 
  basic tokamaks that can be operated in the regime that iter will have ( h-mode , for `` high confinement '' ) , have been around for almost 30 years now . 
  so the additional complexity of the stellarator magnetic field topology is also a possible source of instability . 
  unfortunately i do n't know enough about them to tell you whether there will be a problem in the future or not . 
  let 's hope it wo n't . 
  about that ship ... probably ? 
  the bigger you make it , the easier it is to confine the hot plasma . 
  i 'm not sure it will be economical or practical to put such a big reactor on a freighter in the end . 
  ( in space , eventually , on water , do n't know . ), 
   btw. , how would practical fusion reactors work out on the small scale , in terms of size , energy output and cost ? 
  i do n't expect to have one in my laptop one day , but what i understand is that you put energy in , and you get energy out , and if , say , input scales logarithmically and output linear ( or linear and exponentially ) , there must be some point where the two curves meet and somewhere beyond that it would become cost-efficient . 
  there will probably never will be a small fusion reactor unless we figure out how to produce cheap muons . 
  then we can do cold fusion ;-) we have this equation called the lawson criterion . 
  the triple product of density , temperature and confinement time must exceed a certain threshold to achieve break even , i.e. 
  external heating + fusion heating = power loss , or even ignition , i.e. 
  the plasma heating itself enough to continue the process all by itself ( although still requiring external magnetic fields ) . 
  [ these slides ( from slide 9 onwards ) ] ( https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:2gw-43dtbbkj:www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/cfsa/people/pastmembers/peeters/teaching/lecture2.ppt+&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=adgeesgpbxb7jez6mgs8qbbr9jckzab-lysjv0z39wb1ex62sbs8ci-df-tqycoz9iikr09w4reya8lbpqsksoz560wh3f1r9j1ccaaud2tcfmsnudigsivhejjhbccz95cu4egtkctl&amp;sig=ahietbts6n0qbfi9_dceytlpoacytv-tmq&amp;pli=1 ) illustrate it . 
  as you can see , fusion power scales with a square , power loss is linear . 
  on slide 16 you can see how close we are . 
  so far , the achieved triple product doubles in less than 18 months , so we can claim to be better than the chip researchers ;-)  on a side note , iter 's cost seems to be $ 15bn . 
  almost peanuts compared to the other figures we 've gotten used to on this subreddit . 
  wendelstein 7-x will come in under a billion , that 's about ten eurofighters , and 300 of those are planned . 
  tell the federal government , they are slashing the domestic fusion budget from eur 125m to 120m . 
  i 'd like to take the opportunity to link to [ this graph from mit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sjh5r.jpg ) illustrating necessary and actual funding to get a functioning machine . 
  i do n't have such numbers for germany or europe , but it 's probably very similar . 
  and people complain that we always need a little longer . 
  well ... 
  nope , sorry . 
  yes , i 'm at aug. 
  they do look cooler . 
  that 's why it took so long to get them really working : creating the magnetic field completely through external coils is very challenging . 
  the computational power necessary to calculate them just was n't there . 
  now that we have it , stellarators become a real contender . 
  their biggest advantage is that they just get turned on and keep running whereas tokamaks so far depend on pulsed operation . 
  it 's very well possible that stellarators will come out on top in the end , especially because of this . 
  demo , iter 's succesor , might be a stellarator . 
  at least they 're already working on suitable designs . 
  until then people like me will try to see if and how we might be able to run tokamaks in steady state as well . 
  that would be very nice because the community already has decades of experience with relatively developed tokamaks , something that stellarators are still missing . 
  there have been some amas already , for example [ someone from ipp greifswald ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/mpc9g/iama_nuclear_fusion_scientist_american_expat_in/ ) or [ from mit ] ( http://it.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qdbxg/askscience_ama_series_we_are_nuclear_fusion/ ) . 
  if you still have questions , i 'll try to answer them here . 
  i 'm a phd student doing some ground work for so-called advanced tokamaks , i.e. 
  tokamak reactors that can run continuously as opposed to the pulsed operation of iter . 
  have you heard the phrase `` all news is local '' ? 
  why not ? 
  we could actually put this into / r/switzerland as well , since cern is in switzerland . 
  no , seriously , no one knows farage unless your first language is english or look for him specifically . 
  cohn-bendit is pretty well known , not only in germany and france . 
  c ** e ** rn, 
  because banks are people , too . 
  you racist , you . 
  as a fusion scientist , i demand the same hype for iter in a few years . 
  it 's close to cern , too . 
  some kind of dependence day perhaps ? 
  no , legal persons are a completely normal thing . 
  except americans decided to give them free , almost completely ( ? ), 
  unregulated , speech . 
  which is standard procedure in such a case , i might add . 
  see the groups pressuring meps to vote against stuff like acta ? 
  that 's a lobby . 
  i would n't want to miss these guys . 
  how do you know how these things were back then ? 
  i might be wrong , but the things you mention seem to me to stem from the former dictatorships . 
  knew what it was before i clicked it . 
  you do n't seem to get the point . 
  the whole deal of the common market is this : everyone gets unfiltered access to everyone 's markets in exchange for common regulations . 
  i do n't know where you are from , but if your country does n't want that , it is free to leave .
