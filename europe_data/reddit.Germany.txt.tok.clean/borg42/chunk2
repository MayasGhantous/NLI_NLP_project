  to say people do n't start a business because of bureaucracy is an excuse , nothing more . 
  this is not about the money . 
  this kind of funding always comes with strings attached . 
  you could also call it a bribe . 
  the project will be build by european companies , the natural gas price for all of the gas that europe buys from algeria will magically stay low , the new regulations will be compatible to european regulations and thus favor european companies for new installations , etc. 
  merkel also brings `` christian values '' , like no official marriage for gays and criminalization of marihuana and lots of funky right of center conservative stuff like that . 
  4 years of a center left coalition could totally fix that and the cdu/csu would probably not even roll anything of this back if they get back into power . 
  your point is of course correct , but the graph is about wealth , not income . 
  a same size house can be worth $ 1mil in london while it is worth $ 100k in bucharest . 
  if you otherwise have the same income you may very well be able to to afford more in bucharest instead of being the `` millionaire in london '' . 
  the floats are usually about broad topics , not about specific events .

   its been 10 years and their simulation failed to deliver because it is a little bit worse then what they predicted 30 years ago ? 
  or what do you mean ? 
  i meant what we call `` altnazi '' in germany . 
  nazis that were alive during wwii . 
   ... and they are untouchable , covered by various `` privacy '' laws , often rehabilitated during the decades following the wwii . 
  directly after wwii , sure . 
  konrad adenauer famously said `` man sch\u00fcttet kein dreckiges wasser aus , wenn man kein reines hat '' : you do n't throw out your dirty water if you do n't have any clean water . 
  but nowadays ? 
  the ones that were convicted in the last few years are all over 90 : http://time.com/3958690/nazi-war-criminals-still-alive/ i do n't think there are that many real nazis left alive to be worried about ? 
  if that is the case we need to work on increasing efficiency instead of pouring more money in our apparently very inefficient militaries . 
  it does n't matter when the guidelines were set , if they have such a long implementation timeframe and germany abides by it there is no breach in agreement . 
  but the 2 % spending goal is for 2026 and germany already increased the budget by nearly 0.1 % in 2016 . 
  if you do the math , 2 % by 2026 seems very reasonable . 
  also merkel has said several times that germany will reach the target in time . 
  so germany does follow the agreement . 
  it does n't make any sense to double the budget in just one year , the money would totally go to waste . 
  so there is no problem in this regard . 
  i just think that the 2 percent goal is ridiculous , seeing how much money europe already pours in the military . 
  why not have a 1.5 % rule , more cooperation and put an additional 0.5 % in education ( for example ) . 
  in that case i would say we should prioritize to spend the money more efficiently instead of pouring more into it . 
  how much more money then russia do you think europe needs to spend on the military ? 
  in the cold war the ussr spend about 2x as much as europe , currently europe spends about 3.5 x as much as russia . 
  i always thought there was black culture ( music , art etc by black people ) and `` black culture '' ( everything bad that black people do ) . 
  ok , fair enough . 
  i do n't actually now what exactly that is supposed to mean  . 
  i do n't think you want to go there because connormc1eod is right on this . 
  if it were true that the majority of muslims and blacks are bad , you definitely could criticize someone for being a muslim . 
  because he has a choice and by associating himself with this bad group he gives this group credence . 
  you can however never criticize someone for being a specific skin color . 
  it is not a choice . 
  that said , if it were true that all blacks and muslims are bad , you would of course rather deal with a muslim , since you have chance to change his opinion . 
  you ca n't change skin color . 
  here is a list of all officially recognized ausbildungsberufe : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_von_ausbildungsberufen i personally would say that lots of them are harder to obtain than one of the easier bachelors . 
  but what metric do you want to use to compare the difficulty level ? 
  some of the ausbildungsberufe in germany are harder to obtain than a bachelor . 
  for example a air traffic controller has a entry wage of ~ 6000 $ / month . 
  but it is just a normal ausbildungsberuf and will not count as tertiary education . 
  it is well known how these loopholes work . 
  why on earth is it so hard to close them ? 
   equal say but little power to change anything . 
  we could bitch and moan for as long as we wanted , but all that matters to the eu is germany and benelux . 
  does n't really make sense to discuss about this anymore , but this is so not true ... 
  the uk has a very privileged status inside of the eu , a new joining member would never get all of the exceptions the uk has . 
  historically the uk was for example very much in favor of the eastern enlargement of the eu , while most eu countries ( at the time ) were not . 
  so how come that the eu expanded so much ? 
  then finally all agreed and then in 2013 ( when it was way too late ) you changed your mind and now `` you never got what you wanted '' ? 
  take a look at the whole 50 year history and not only the last 4 years ... 
   canada is tiny compared to the eu , and you two just concluded trade negotiations . 
  are they vassals of the eu ? 
  there is a good argument to be made that the deal is bad for canada and it was also very badly received in the eu . 
  it is probably fair to say that it is a bad deal all around . 
   this all sounds like brexit politics rather than geopolitics . 
  nobody called australia vassals when they signed a free trade deal with us . 
  what ? 
  there were lots of protests and experts saying that it is a bad deal . 
  since this deal is older we can even look at the data ... http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/02/08/the-costs-of-australias-free-trade-agreement-with-america/  the agreement was responsible for reducing -- or diverting -- $ 53.1 billion of trade with the rest of the world by 2012 . 
  imports to australia and the united states from the rest of the world fell by $ 37.5 billion and exports to the rest of the world from the two countries fell by $ 15.6 billion over eight years to 2012 . 
   beyond the $ 53 billion of trade that has been diverted , there is no evidence that the agreement has been associated with an increase in trade between the two countries, 
   because the uk-us trade deal wo n't be a carbon copy of ttip . 
  that is my point . 
  it wo n't be any better than ttip ( for the uk ) , otherwise trump would n't have cancelled ttip . 
  the logic is not that hard to understand . 
  in the 28-nation union the uk had equal say with the others . 
  with the us they will be a tiny partner . 
  answer me this : if trump thinks ttip was so bad for the us that he had to cancel it on the first day of his presidency : why would he give a trade deal to the uk now that is as good or better than ttip ? 
  that would n't make any sense . 
  do n't forget that there were lots and lots of protests in europe against ttip , because they thought that the deal was bad for europe and too good for the us . 
  my numbers come from vw themselfs : https://www.volkswagen-media-services.com/fr/detailpage/-/detail/volkswagen-group-delivers-993million-vehicles-in-2015/view/3055390/7a5bbec13158edd433c6630f5ac445da?p_p_auth=nsxxom2w i ca n't find the statista numbers on the vw website , but i assume they are correct . 
  so the average vw sold in the us costs ~ 8 times as much as the average vw sold in china ? 
  but i think my general point still stands : with an additional 30 % german car tax the car sales would n't go to 0 . 
  many of the luxury car buyers probably do n't care about a 30 % price increase . 
  i personally would answer this kind of tax with a tax on some market that is dominated by us companies ( internet search , social media , etc ) . 
  edit : and here the same is true : many advertisers would n't care if they would have to pay 30 % more to advertise on google.de . 
  there is n't really an alternative . 
  so the whole thing would n't change that much , realistically ... 
  the german car manufacturers already sell much more cars to china than to the us . 
  it is not like they are not already concentrating on china . 
  in 2015 the whole vokswagen group sold 3,548,600 cars in china and 607,100 cars in the usa . 
  even if the us stops to buy german cars completely , a 20 % increase in chinese sales ( which does not sound unreasonable ) would equalize that . 
  no new agreements needed . 
  so i think the people overestimate the importance of the usa for the german car manufacturers ? 
  if you want to retaliate on a 30 % german car tax , you would probably try to invent a 30 % us internet company tax for google/facebook/etc . 
  ah , yes . 
  lewandowski does have a very harsh polish accent , so nobody would think that he was born in germany . 
  with podolski you would n't now that just from the speech . 
  that is probably why many were surprised to see him in poland in the map . 
  he played for the german national team and is currently playing in turkey . 
  this is a funny statement because you can be sure that any data facebook has access to , the nsa can access too .
