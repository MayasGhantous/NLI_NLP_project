  so everything you trust facebook with , you automatically also trust the us government with . 
  to me it feels like hospitals in germany are always overfilled . 
  how can it be that england ( for example ) has half of the hospital beds per capita compared to germany ? 
  that ca n't be correct , can it ? 
  did breitbart find this `` ruhrnachrichten.de '' article and accidentally misinterpreted the german to write their own article ? 
  or did they know exactly what they were doing and just made it up and linked the `` ruhrnachrichten.de '' article to give it some legitimacy ? 
  i do fear that it is the latter one . 
  i think they know exactly what they are doing ... 
  a europe-wide finger print database for asylum seekers is already operational since 2003 . 
  they are just incapable to use it properly . 
  i found it very interesting to read the comments of the this news from 14 years ago ( german ) : https://www.heise.de/forum/heise-online/news-kommentare/eu-startet-fingerabdruck-datenbank-fuer-asylbewerber/forum-147630/comment/ the comments are at least as hostile to asylum seekers as they are nowadays . 
  i doubt that this has to do with laziness . 
  if anything i would say the work ethic in germany is actually a bit higher then the european average . 
  i think the qz article captures it quite well . 
  there is no tax incentive to build a house in germany and the regulations are very renter-friendly . 
  that is enough to explain it . 
  the median income in germany is ( a lot ) higher then in greece or even spain . 
  two persons earning 2000 $ / net per month is also enough to build/buy/own a house if you want to . 
  for some reason in germany people like to rent . 
   not really sure whether i agree here . 
  germany banned the swastika and that did n't seem to run out of control . 
  i agree but in my opinion it is a bad policy too . 
  i would rather have people show there ignorance openly for everyone to see ( compared to doing it in secret ) . 
  banning the swastika does n't change the mind of people . 
   i 'm not entirely sure about this . 
  one of the reasons for the burka ban was that it 's a symbol of oppression . 
  but if women wear a symbol of oppression , surely they 're being oppressed ? 
  and if they 're being oppressed , surely we should interfere ? 
  i am as anti-religious as it gets and i understand the sentiment , but banning is not the right approach . 
  if you ban one religious symbol you make it easier for the next more-fascist government to ban many more . 
  if you ban fake news ( even crazier then banning burkas ) , the next more-fascist government can decide what news are fake . 
  the infrastructure is already there . 
  free speech and everything around it should never be compromised . 
  history has shown that it will backfire . 
  shame the men that make the women wear it , laugh at them , spit on them , start an islamic feminist movement . 
  make sure men that make women wear a burka are fired etc. 
  empower women like ayaan hirsi ali , make sure people and muslim women hear what she has to say . 
   the data reveals that without migrants considered , crime rates in germany would have remained roughly static since 2014 . 
  but , in fact , the country recorded an extra 402,741 crimes committed by migrants . 
  from these 402,741 crimes , 386,089 are committed by entering and living in the country . 
  correct ? 
  here is the pdf i think he meant : http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2016/pks-2015.pdf?__blob=publicationfile see page 7 and 8 for most of the numbers . 
  you mean this pdf ? 
  http://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2016/pks-2015.pdf?__blob=publicationfile there seems to be a decrease from 2014 to 2015 in nearly all of the hard crimes , including rape . 
  see page 7 of the pdf . 
  the only thing that increased significantly seems to be `` unerlaubte einreise '' : unlawful entry in the country . 
  which does not seem surprising ... 
  so it seems you are actually wrong ? 
  there are lots of founders in germany currently alive that started some kind of `` mittelstand business '' which would be worth a billion if it would go public . 
  these kinds of founders are never listed in billionaire-lists since they are not easily found . 
  i bet the 7 % difference in `` company founders '' to the us could be equalized with this . 
  take a look at this : https://i.redd.it/gadsexjza6dz.png the dark orange one in the middle are immigrants living in germany . 
  about 2/3 of the dark orange ones are europeans . 
  there are 350.000 dutch/dutch-germans and 3.500.000 russions/russian-germans and 1.000.000 romanians/romanian-germans and 830.000 italians/italian-germans etc. 
  the european immigrant population makes up more than 2/3 of the immigrant population . 
  yes , the 1/3 include the syrians . 
  but they also include 113.000 brazilians and 212.00 chinese and so on . 
  is that supposed to be satire or do you really believe this ? 
  according to wikipedia 7.8 % of the rotterdam inhabitants are of turkish origin ( this includes 2nd generation `` turks '' ) . 
  how many of them do you think would go to war for erdogan ? 
  how could they possibly `` take over '' rotterdam ? 
  why would n't the government be able to intervene ? 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  the last time germany had a left-leaning majority government was in 2005 . 
  that was 12 years ago . 
  by current forecasts the next government will be even more right-leaning then the current one ( cdu-fdp instead of cdu-spd ) . 
  war crimes are enforced extra-territorially in germany . 
  sure , i guess we are discussing about semantics by now . 
  but how do you know if someone if worthy of asylum before you have heard him out ? 
  most of the refugee discussion is currently about the maghreb states and only about ~ 2 % of the asylum applications from the maghreb states have been granted in germany in the last years . 
  the rest did not get asylum . 
  but they often end up in some bureaucracy nightmare in-between status . 
  my point is that this makes this whole discussion about limits meaningless , the `` real asylum seekers '' that you are talking about are not actually coming in huge numbers . 
  the asylum process itself needs to get revised and updated . 
  not some limits or some definitions of who is asylum worthy . 
  those are fine . 
  i did n't know this case , but it seems that he did a crime in the us . 
  so he gets charged and prosecuted in the us with the corresponding us law and jail term . 
  seems pretty normal to me . 
   surely if you 're not actually in a state of being persecuted , you ca n't be seeking asylum ? 
  of course you can apply for asylum . 
  you just will just not get the asylum granted . 
  there is nobody that can stop you from filling out the asylum application forms . 
  nope , jailing for life is no problem . 
  mh , i am not sure . 
  i assume that they both would count as safe too , since they are both part of the `` dublin iii regulation '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation which is a eu-wide regulation . 
  they ca n't possibly include the us , it has the death sentence . 
  a death sentence is always a valid asylum reason in germany . 
  some countries are automatically safe countries , yes . 
  they are called `` sichere herkunftsstaaten '' . 
  they are the blue ones here : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicherer_herkunftsstaat_ ( deutschland ) # / media/file : sichere_herkunftsstaaten_deutschland . svg none of the mahgreb states are . 
  there are legitimate asylum reasons for all of them ( political refugees , persecuted gay people etc ) . 
   who can obtain asylum is defined though and a lot of people coming are not asylum seekers . 
  a lot of people are coming from non war torn countries and are crossing the mediterranean for economic reasons which doesnt fall under asylum . 
  everybody that comes and says he is an asylum seeker is one . 
  then the german state has to determine if he becomes asylum in germany or not . 
  this determination process is inefficient , often takes years and in some cases has ridiculous counter-productive bureaucracy attached to it . 
  this is what has to change . 
   to be fair , how common is it for mps to openly challenge the party leadership ? 
  at least here that 's a very easy way to be expelled from the party , so mps almost always do what their boss ( so , for the cdu , merkel ) tells them unless they really know what they are doing .
