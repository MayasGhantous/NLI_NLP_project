you know , if after all this shit ukraines oligarchs go back to pingponging between russia and the eu to milk both sides , i would be slightly mad . 
  thank you so much !, 
  russia will not let go of crimea , no matter how much sanctions you lay on them , because such a move would be indefensible internally . 
  quite to the contrary any attempt to renegotiate the status of crimea would be seen as an attack on russia 's territorial integrity and would likely strengthen advocacy for a hardline on the issue . 
  it 's a fait accompli , whether we like it or not . 
  so what economic actions do you suggest ? 
  a full blockade ? 
  congratulations , now all option except for * a war with russia * have been exhausted , brilliant . 
  if it does n't work ( and it might or might not ) , what then ? 
  all germany would have achieved were to have less options towards a resolution . 
  furthermore , literally on of the oldest stratagems in the book is to never maneuver your opponent into a corner from which he ca n't escape , or he will fight with the power of desperation . 
  if russia is left without a face saving path to resolve the conflict only impulsive urges of certain countries will be satisfied , but it would be detrimental for the situation overall . 
  and lastly there was n't one bit of game theory in your post , but it would be very interesting to see a stab at how germany can create a strong nash equilibrium with respect to russia 's further actions in ukraine that also has a positive expected value for all of europe , so if you have the muse to write that up , please do so . 
  that would likely be a strain on the russian-german relations and it would probably cost the german chemical and utility industry a dear sum , not even accounting for loss of competitiveness with respect to the global competition . 
  so the question is , what does germany get in return for this ? 
  haha , yes !, 
  finally an excuse to turn prenzlberg into a leper colony , wall , schie\u00dfbefehl and all that . 
  the way i see it the american pivot towards poland is strongly motivated by probability that they might lose their current bridgehead in the eu , the uk . 
  it looks like poland might get their visas eventually . 
  and while poland will no doubt benefit in several ways from this attention , i fear the europe as a whole will be left weaker and less cohesive . 
  / r/worldnews has these filter rules on the side panel , i think it would be great if we had that too , so that people can filter out ukraine related posts without installing res or blocking individual users , which is cumbersome . 
  thank you . 
  can somebody c & p , please ? 
  i recommend against seeing the church tax as a form of donation : https://www.ibka.org/infos/ksteuer.html http://www.kirchensteuer.de it does n't go where you might think it goes . 
  if you are interested in effective charity i would suggest to visit http://www.givewell.org, 
  i used to live near a river once . 
  it 's true , it 's like an autobahn but made of water that flows to the sea . 
  a lot of people seem to be under the impression that germany 's military is composed of a dozen guys with rifles , which is funny , but not accurate . 
  it 's ridiculous that this * question * for an example is downvoted so hard . 
  the echo chamber is more cavernous than it was when the gypsies had `` stolen '' that blonde child or when the `` riots '' in sweden happened ... 
  i can hide this submission , but what i really want is a hide button for berlusconi . 
  i was just kidding . 
  data protection laws make it too cumbersome for google to do all the roads , at least there are currently no plans to expand streetview in germany . 
   on the web , dozens of photomontages with merkel and putin in nazi uniforms have now surfaced . 
  mmh , yes very sensible move . 
  if i recall correctly similar instances of merkel depicted in nazi uniforms convinced the troika to give greece a much better deal . ^ ^ \\ / s, 
  all the csu 's plan : if you want to see the german country side you `` ll have to drive , and for that you 'll need a vignette . 
  they boasted that they have repaired it ( http://cs617616.vk.me/v617616952/1443e/amefx--rot8.jpg ) , now given occam 's razor , what 's more likely ? 
  they stole the system from the ukrainian army , repaired it , and used it . 
  or b. 
  they stole it from the ukrainian army , hid it or moved it to russia , got another system from russia and then used that ? 
  i tell you what , option b seems rather convoluted . 
  mind you - it 's one thing bring cars and trucks over the border unnoticed , and another to drive this thing around !, 
  regarding point 2 and 3 , please give sources . 
  do you have * any * proof for this ? 
  according to the loudest voices on this sub you 'd have to come to the conclusion that it was putin himself . 
  i agree that the conversation is rather vague . 
  but then how is the headline `` new intercepts released by ukraine 's security service : how a buk-m was ** sent from russia with crew , and other details ** '' justified ? 
  it is n't . 
  that is pure speculation , what 's more , we pretty much [ know ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=31f_1405616881 ) that the separatist have captured the system from the ukrainian military . 
   it crossed , it crossed the strip . 
  it does n't say anything about a border , it could be the delimiter of the separatist controlled area to the rest of ukraine . 
  and again , where is the stuff about the russian crew ? 
  the entire submission title is not supported by the recording . 
  the title is editorialized which is against the rules of this subreddit . 
  so , where does it say that the system and crew is from russia ? 
  yes , the ukrainian government denied that the separatists had a * working * system . 
  but the separatist posted pictures of it ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=31f_1405616881 ) and later claimed to have restored it to working condition , which sounds believable enough now ... 
   ukrainian police hidden cam captured terrorists moving s.a.m buk back to russia . 
  that 's a pretty sneaky editorialization of the title , which just says ** militants take the missile system `` buk '' to the border with russia ** . 
  you implying that it the system was from russia , when it was stolen from ukrainian military . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this talking point is just the excuse du jour . 
  the american intelligence community is committed to total information awareness , without any consideration for unintended consequences . 
  yes , the most influential member of the bloc , but that too will not be forever . 
  the german raison d'\u00c9tat simply does not permit to shove it 's partners around , particularly in military terms , and while i can understand how the result of that looks tediously slow , i also think that a bossy germany would do more harm than good to european cohesion . 
  first of all i do n't think germany should see herself as a shepherd , but rather as partner to her central european neighbours . 
  it 's simply silly to equate the importance poland and the baltics have to germany to that of the ukraine . 
  it 's one thing to wish to have a partnership with russia ( and it is important to remember that there will be a russia after putin , and a free russia one day ) , and another entirely to want them as a neighbour . 
  secondly , not once has poland or the baltics publicly asked for assistance from germany in the ukraine conflict . 
  i think their respective leaders should put public pressure on germany , to , for instance , form common battlegroups . 
  but that has n't happened , and it would be inappropriate for germany to suggest this for certain historical sensibilities . 
  while it 's true that the central europeans have a justified fear of russia , it is also important to remember that anti-german sentiments still linger . 
  how about europe ? 
  congratulations mondays , you have reached the final stage : acceptance !, 
  actually i think san marino did at one point . 
  it 's almost as if the usa and russia were held to different standards . 
  since anti-americanism means little more than opposition towards the usa 's foreign policy in this context , i can only hope that everyone is a little bit anti-american , even americans . 
  it 's only treason if it 's unsuccessful . 
   forever lose its primacy in the world not so fast ... 
  firstly i do n't think germans are against nato bases in the those countries because they would like them all for themselves , and secondly there is a sizable opposition towards nato forces in germany . 
  in the particular case of germany neutrolgreek may even be right concerning american spying - the nato-truppenstatut , that is the contract regulating the american and british forces in germany is suspected to legalize those activities . 
  but some aspects of the statues are not public so it 's hard to tell whether they are constitutional or not . 
  i was refering to the composition of the untersuchungsausschuss . 
  hopefully the greens and the left will bring the issue to the constitutional court , it 's one of the few institutions that 's somewhat trustworthy . 
  i named it after the place where it all happens , not by the parties involved . 
  very well put . 
  i think as long as both parties involved try to coin their own terms ( terrorism and civil war ) respectively it would be best to stick to ukrainian conflict or something . 
  looks cozy . 
  what 's that colourful art installation they have instead of a lawn ? 
   so answer for 2nd part of your question is russia . 
  it appears to me that at least one other nation with a habit of eavesdropping on people 's conversations and toppling governments would stand to profit more than russia from a kaczynski government . 
  particularly if their last bridgehead in europe is in danger of breaking off at any time . 
  but conspiracy theories as you say , lets wait and see . 
  assuming that these tapes have been leaked to topple the current government , which party is going to profit most from it ? 
  and by extension , who is going to profit most from the foreign policy of that party ? 
  it takes two to dance :3, 
  til , thank you . 
  i tried to google it , but to no avail , as you might imagine . 
  not to derail your post , but  \\ ^ \\ ^ what does it represent ? 
  what emotional state is it supposed to express ?
