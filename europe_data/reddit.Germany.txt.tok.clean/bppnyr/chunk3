  i know an anglophone surgeon who ca n't be bothered with grammatical gender either , he just uses all of them : derdiedas skalpell bitte . 
  actually one of the main detractors of france 's economic model is the economist , and the people there are by and large against austerity . 
  interesting . 
  i assume that if the uk agreed to this proposed solution ( whatever it may be ) it means that it either does n't set a precedent or sets one favourable to the uk in case of a brexit . 
  yes , in the context of [ ostpolitik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostpolitik ) . 
  i do n't have a problem with analogies or metaphors , i have problem with the roleplaying . 
  but that 's precisely the problem : you are not the only one !, 
  if you think acting as a landmass is an appropriate stylistic device for this sub , please consider the consequences . 
  do you think it adds anything valuable to the debate ? 
  oh for fucks sake , look at your comment history !, 
   [ and who the fuck am i ? 
  the world 's only remaining super power , the largest national economy in the world , the most capable military in the world ( when it comes to power projection ) and a u.n. security council member . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24bvuf/david_cameron_pledged_tonight_to_step_down_as/ch5v3l2 )  [ you are a former empire which has shrunk down to a area a little larger than oregon , with a population & economy closer to california than either germany or japan . 
  one who only keeps their unsc seat because of tradition rather than practicality . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24bvuf/david_cameron_pledged_tonight_to_step_down_as/ch5v3l2 ) this shit belongs to / r/polandball , go there !, 
  you would do well to remember that / r/europe is a place for individuals who want to share their thoughts and opinions , ** not ** a place to roleplay as countries . 
  i did not write that latvia should appeal to a non-existing military , i said that they should appeal to specific european countries ( gb fr de it sp ) . 
   if politics stops being about morality completely , then what separates us from china and russia or iran ? 
  do you actually believe that politics has ever - anywhere - been about morality ?!, 
  `` everything in the world is about sex except sex . 
  sex is about power . '', 
  -- oscar wilde ( persecuted by our very own moral politicians of yesteryear ), 
  being dependent on them gives them more influence on latvian policies and reduces the urgency for a european military , both of which make further european integration more difficult . 
  besides , why should european citizens care about latvia when they have already called team world police ^ tm ? 
  the balts and poland should put pressure on western europe . 
  copy of all images : https://imgur.com/a/nbfex#0, 
  has the latvian government publicly asked for military support from germany ? 
  what eastern europe is doing - running straight to the us - is very detrimental for all of europe , arguably even more detrimental in the long run than germany 's reluctance to jump into another cold war . 
  oh please , no more dailybeast articles , they 're just another propaganda blog . 
  i would not describe some crummy pictures as a publicity stunt either . 
  if you can explain what you ` words and actions ' are worthy of condemnation , please do so . 
  putin may be an autocrat but gerd was n't . 
  also , it 's incredibly naive to think of bilateral relationships in binary terms . 
  countries are n't mono focal , they have a range of sometimes contradictory interests , it 's important to keep back channels open . 
  perhaps , perhaps not . 
  growth is probably more contingent on newly discovered resources or innovation , the discovery of which is difficult to predict . 
  economists are mostly superstitious pigeons , they and the media vastly overestimate the efficacy of economic policies . 
  no , you can check out any time you like , but you can never leave . 
  i refer to my [ previous post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23p349/eurozone_fiscal_colonialism/cgz8j7c ) and wait for george . 
  source is : http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/sapienza/htm/cultural_biases.pdf it 's an interesting paper because it tries to figure out what influences trust , such as a common culture , military history , geographic proximity , language , etc. 
  i 'm not making an analogy . 
  yes that 's what i meant , 
  i suppose resisting the fsb 's orders is comparable to not complying with a national security letter - that is illegal , but certainly in the interest of everyone whose privacy was criminally undermined by those agencies , in other words you and me . 
  not everything that is against the laws is criminal because the laws themselves are unjust . 
  note that i am not comparing america to russia or snowden to durov . 
  there is an amazing symmetry at work here : snowden flees the us to expose the vast surveillance network of the nsa and ends up in russia that we know * does just the same * . 
  and this guy flees from russia because the government tried to pressure him into sharing user data to the us whose government * does just the same * . 
  yes , the former . 
  french father , estonian mother , grew up in the uk . 
  i meant to add information . 
  there is method in the madness : soon there will be a similar article in the economist , george soros will write an op-ed and james wolfsohn will take the same line ( perhaps in the new statesman ? ) . 
  in other words something is raggling the lse 's jumpies . 
  ah , it 's more complicated !, 
  ca n't say i 'm sad . 
  the title of the article is a bit sensationalist . 
  but the data is very interesting : * it does not include capital gains , thus the income gap between rich in poor is likely more extreme in reality ( for all countries ) * using income after taxes obscures the disposability : americans have more cash but need to spend some of that healthcare and education . 
  all in all if you 're rich you 're better of in america and if you 're poor you 're better of in europe/canada . 
  some other interesting aspect of the charts : * norway , netherlands , britain , ireland & spain catching up massively in the past 30 years . 
  * german reunification and wage restraint clearly visible . 
  * uk top percentile made huuuge gains in income . 
  actually it 's rather well studied , you can use the references here as a starting point : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deindividuation, 
  well , italy , france and germany , so the biggest spenders in that regard sans the uk , will not invest more in nato because they do n't get anything out of it . 
  and instead of turning to their european allies new europe is all to willing to run to america to ask for help , what they should be doing is pressuring the countries mention above . 
  of course that 's in part because they do n't feel that their concerns are taken seriously in berlin , paris and rome ... so it 's tricky . 
  ( btw , when i said global adventurism i meant european military interventions worldwide , so i think we actually agree that a defense pact would n't and should n't do that ), 
  the fundamental issue here is nato itself . 
  it may present itself as a defense pact but is defacto just a multiplier of american foreign interests . 
  america pays for the drinks and call the shots ; this essentially necessitates that american interests are hurt before it becomes active . 
  what we really need is a european defense pact , because only if people see europe as one entity they will see an incursion on a part thereof as an incursion against all . 
  keeping it strictly a territorial defense pact will also make it possible for currently `` neutral '' countries to get behind it and will hopefully keep global adventurism at bay . 
  that should be done with case by case alliances . 
  the only other country that 's anywhere near as obsessed as russia is about ww2 is poland . 
  [ vla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vla ) is pretty nice ... 
  hungarian is such an odd language to my ears , some times it sounds swedish to me , sometimes more like romanian . 
  rap with german lyrics , different times , different styles .

  thanks for your reply , now i have an inexplicable urge to ask you about your opinion on the second vatican council . 
  but to go on subject : his personal opinions are irrelevant as long as they can not interfere with his job , and there are lots of jobs where your opinion on other peoples family lives does not matter at all - but it does as a justice commissioner . 
  if you think not appointing a general surgeon who is in favour of homeopathy or a esa director you extols the virtues of intelligent falling is an intolerant or oppressive form of liberalism and i would have to disagree . 
   as a roman catholic , buttiglione believes that homosexuality is a sin , and that `` the family exists in order to allow women to have children and to have the protection of a male who takes care of them '' [ link ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3734572.stm ) sounds pretty homophobic to me . 
  except that 's not the case , germany has no far right/left parties that combine to 54 % - after all it 's not france , 
  it 's the [ flag of berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_berlin ) . 
  the alternate text is user editable . 
  good to know that we have reached to bottom of the barrel in this discourse : germans are actually cryptorussians . 
  care to explain ? 
   anyone who views the soviet rapist-soldiers as liberators is as deluded as the soviet citizens who viewed the nazis as liberators . 
  the only liberators were the western allies , and history would have been so much better if the west had pushed all the way to the oder . 
  i 'm at a lack of words . 
  but sure all the people in the kzs would have loved to wait for a couple of months or years longer to be liberated by the only real good guys . 
   but this is a very fancy silenced sniper rifle that one of the `` protestors '' was armed with . 
  looks like an [ ar-15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ar-15 ) to me , but hard to tell with that quality . 
  that would be a workable stratagem , but the result would be very unappealing for europe : united but with a powerful enemy as its neighbour . 
  think about how different north america would look like if canada and the u.s. or the u.s. and mexico were in permanent quarrel . 
  or perhaps the situation between india and pakistan . 
  the other thing is that we must never hurt russia so much that it destabilizes . 
  we have that issue in north africa already . 
  it would mean unsafe boarders and tons of refugees .
