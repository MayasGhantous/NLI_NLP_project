yeah , and hitler was a vegetarian . 
  you do n't get useful insights that way . 
  yes , it 's obviously very difficult to get meaningful numbers , to a large part because rape is inherently a crime that is hard to prove or disprove . 
  but there seems to be a pretty broad consensus that the percentage of false allegations is at least 2 % , probably a bit more . 
  and that 's not what i would call `` a tiny , tiny minority '' , and especially not something that should be ignored when formulating policy , though of course it also should not be the foremost concern . 
  please educate yourself . 
  the islamists could only rise * because * the population saw them as the much smaller evil compared of the shah , and he got into power in a coup against a democratically elected , very popular and progressive president . 
  so in a page listing * dozens * of studies and estimations , you choose the single one that has the lowest percentage by far . 
  and you ask * me * to stop the bullshit ? 
  * the deterrence factor of the justice system applies to immigrants just as much as natives . 
  both know that it exists . 
  * millions of crimes are committed by native europeans every year . 
  somtimes you will live next to them without even knowing . 
  * pretty much all countries have justice systems . 
  rape and murder are illegal in syria as well . 
  so immigrants have your `` historial of obeying justice '' just like you . 
  * `` infested with savages that are not expected to respect the rule of law . '', 
  is nothing but racist bullshit . 
  you meant [ `` rise of the shah '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d'%c3%a9tat ) , did n't you ? 
  and that was the handiwork of the uk first , and the usa only second . 
  the statement which is full of untruths ( and idiotic racism ) is yours , not his . 
  feel free to whine about political correctness , just be aware that it merely marks you as a racist asshole . 
  [ not all that tiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_accusation_of_rape#estimates_of_prevalence ) . 
  and it should most definitely be taken into account , because if `` always believe the victim '' actually became a reality in law enforcement , the number of false accusations would skyrocket , since it would be a guaranteed-to-work tool for unscrupulous women ( or men using them as proxies ) to ruin any man whom they dislike or from whose ruin they could profit . 
  because to get a representative picture you need a * random * sample , and individual incidents published by newspapers are not by any stretch of imagination random . 
  and no , `` different political side '' does n't mean that the biases somehow cancel each other out , even if it 's true . 
  they may in fact publish stuff specifically in order to counter allegations of being biased . 
  and if you had 10 reports every single day , that would still not be a representative picture of the situation . 
  it 's really funny how the racists keep repeating this `` waaah , waaah , evil liberal mainstream media are sweeping everything bad about migrants under the rug '' bullshit in all these threads of op links to mainstream media articles about exactly these issues . 
  that all sounds pretty good - and is the kind of thing that the eu should have done 3 years ago , especially since it takes time to coordinate and set up . 
  instead , they chose to pretty much ignore the problem and let it fester , clinging to the inadequate and unbalanced dublin iii regulation , until it turned into the current acute crisis which they could not ignore anymore . 
  and this has led to acute problems which require short term solutions . 
  unfortunately , many prefer `` solutions '' that would do nothing but allow them to go back to ignoring the problem and letting it fester as quickly as possible . 
  my point is that not ignoring or foisting off the refugee problem * is * in fact not only the noble thing to do but also better for the long-term welfare of the citizens of the eu . 
  we do * not * want turkey to descend into civil war , or the refugee camps persisting for decades to become the next palestine . 
   why not take in a reasonable amount of refugees from actual refugee camps near syria if we really want to help ? 
  in the mid-term that would indeed be a better solution ( at least if the definition of `` reasonable '' is not `` the minimum amount we can take that 's not obviously a fig leaf '' ) , but it was one that eu leaders were completely unwilling to contemplate for years while the situation escalated further and further . 
   some isis people were spotted among the immigrants . 
  nope . 
  there were a bunch of fake or completely misattributed photos that were debunked . 
  there were also reports of isis members which were investigated by authorities , but not a single one turned out to be legit . 
  it will go down . 
  economies of scale , baby !, 
  that 's a disgraceful ( and stupid ) copout . 
  huge refugee camps in the directly neighboring countries where hundreds of thousands of people stay dependant on food handouts and no hope of making a living for themselves are not only a human rights disaster that can not be ignored by developed countries that take their ideals seriously . 
  they 're also a breeding ground for extremists and can destabilize the host countries , creating even worse problems for the whole world , including the eu . 
  yeah , and fuck those countries , who cares how messed up they become or what inhumane measures they have to resort to as long as we are n't bothered !, 
  when you make it impossible for people in need to come legally , blaming them for coming illegally just shows that you care jack shut for their need and are merely grasping for reasons not to provide help . 
  sheesh , how dense can you be ? 
  you do n't hear that because it 's not an established common phrase in english . 
  i am rather certain that you * do * hear them shout things like `` oh my god '' , `` damn '' , `` thank god '' and `` hell , yeah ! '', 
  quite a lot . 
  does n't mean looking solely at them given an accurate view of what the phrase means . 
  how many muslims do ? 
  yeah , that has worked so great in afghanistan ... 
  you and the people you talk to are not necessarily a representative sample of `` the public '' . 
  a truly religious person would actually be less likely to use such phrases lightly . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord's_resistance_army for one . 
  but the funny thing is that the question has no bearing at all on the fact that `` allah hu akbar '' is used as a perfectly mundane expression of excitement many times more often than as a battle cry . 
  you really , really did n't understand anything ... 
  how many westerns have you witnessed shooting an rpg at a tank ? 
  how enemy tanks getting hit by bazookas have you witnessed among english-speaking soldiers ? 
  selective perception . 
  you only believe that because videos where people use the phrase to celebrate a birth or wedding , to calm themselves when injured in an accident , or even just to comment on a football match , are not newsworthy . 
  it 's a phrase whose literal meaning is completely disconnected to its ridiculously widespread use . 
  basically at this point all it means is `` i am excited '' . 
  the english equivalent is `` oh my god '' . 
   damn is shouting allahu akbar really a thing only terrorist do ? 
  nope . 
   westerners constantly say `` thank god '' and we do n't bat an eye . 
  yep , you got it exactly right . 
  because those people are ignorant about the usage of the phrase . 
  and you 're an obvious ignorant idiot ... 
  `` oh my god '' is the closest thing we have in english . 
  apparently you do n't know any muslims at all ( or at least have n't heard them talking in arabic ) . 
  because that is utter bullshit . 
  i 'd love to see how long you 'd be peaceful when locked into a crowded camp consisting of makeshift tents and inadequate sanitation facilities . 
  it 's not false or idiotic when applied to this single town which just happens to be completely overwhelmed due to its geographical position . 
  except they do n't , it 's a self-glorifying myth every whiny bitch on the right tells each other until they believe themselves to be the poor oppressed voice of reason . 
  nice that you have such a sensible view and are not a racist using the lowest form of wit . 
  that 's hilarious on multiple levels . 
  this one is from a local newspaper and cites police press releases . 
  thankfully , `` the west '' still has respect for the principles of human rights it claims to value , and is not governed by racist assholes like you . 
  and yes , that is what you are if you think that a crime committed by one libyan man proves that a woman or child ( or innocent man ) from syria must be a criminal too and should be dropped into a war zone , or in a desert left to starve . 
  it wo n't affect the application for asylum because that will likely be processed before the criminal case is , and it 's not ( and should not be ) the job of the asylum office to decide who is innocent or guilty in advance or in parallel to a judge . 
  however , he can not get protection if he is sentenced to prison for 3 years or more ( which this should warrant ) . 
  not sure if that means an already granted asylum will be retracted , or something else . 
  yeah , foist off the problem on someonen poorer . 
  that 's got ta work !, 
  `` without being consciously aware of '' , that 's a different thing than `` without knowing '' . 
  again , pretty much the same as `` oh my god '' ( or `` damn '' , or `` bless you '' ) - something that people just use without thinking , whether they are religious , secular or atheist . 
  * of course * they know it has a religious meaning if you point it out to them , but that is completely irrelevant to their usage of it . 
  hell , ( see what i did there ? ), 
  actually devout religious people probably use such expressions * less * than others because they do n't want to use them lightly or wrongly . 
  oh , and the pointing :  to most people saying the phrase becomes such second nature , that they often do n't think about its original meaning as they are saying the takbir . '', 
  nope : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/takbir - do read all of it . 
  `` god is great * er * '' , actually . 
  and if at all , it could only be interpreted to say something about the user 's intensity of christian belief exactly because * unlike * the arabic phrase , it is not a common saying . 
  this is n't about literal translations . 
  it 's about how a phrase is used and what people associate with it .
