  no , then it would be only a handful of people . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's just the `` stay in a 500 chf/night hotel room and spend 20,000 chf shopping for luxury clothes , bags , and watches . '', 
  crowd . 
  oh , certainly not a full scale war . 
  but some saber-rattling to shake things up , scare some people and see which way they run ? 
  i would not be surprised one bit . 
  unless putin figures he can gain something from escalating this . 
  terrorists : ` all the migrants are viktor orban \u00b4, 
  the one who 's lying off their tits is you . 
  look at the numbers from [ bamf.de ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201501-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) and you will see that for 2012-2014 the peak was always in oct-nov followed by a sharp decline to the lowest point in feb-march . 
  the german authorities have not published the information that led them to cancel the hannover game , so we do not know whether there was a bomb threat , shooting threat , or whether the information actually turned out to be completely false after the fact . 
  because that has worked so well with the taliban ? 
  poe 's law in action ... 
  if anyone does ridiculous mental gymanstics and is extremely biased , it is you . 
  the chart shows one thing which is clearly and simply delineated : total number of terror victims in western europe by year . 
  if you want to see something else , that is your problem , not the chart 's . 
  no , for 1993 it says `` n.a. '', 
  so for some reason their sources had no data for it ( as opposed to data saying `` no terrorist attacks ) . 
   it 's impossible to mistake huge passenger aircraft flying on 11km for smaller military transport aircrafts flying at 4-6km . 
  that assumes you 're competent at using your equipment and diligent about identifying targets . 
  by all accounts , mh17 was shot down by a bunch of paramilitaries who 'd been given serious military gear by russia , but insufficient training . 
  there 's a lot of friendly fire incidents which in hindisght seem `` impossible to mistake '' . 
  do n't underestimate the power of incompetence and negligence . 
  which one , dpa , the global terrorism database , or the university of maryland ? 
  unfortunately , the instinct to lash out when you feel attacked is too strong for most politicians to ignore . 
  let 's not stoop down to the same preemptive whining they do ... 
  i do n't think so , there were also a bunch of neofascist and marxist or maoist terror groups operating in various countries . 
  yeah , which is one reason why it 's not counted . 
   russian metrojet 9268 did n't happen in western europe . 
  conversely , lockerbie counts , even though it was an american airline and had mostly american victims . 
  there were citizens of various european countries in the wtc and lots of other terrorist attacks all around the world as well . 
  but the statistic is about `` terrorist attacks in western europe '' , not about `` western european victims of terrorist attacks '' . 
  which is why lockerbie counts although it was an american airline and had mostly american victims . 
  mh17 was not in western europe , and was arguably not an act of terrorism . 
  but yes , the definition of what exactly counts as terrorism is hard to nail down and leaves room for bias . 
  except no , the statistic is from the german refugee office which also lists an acceptance rate of over 90 % for syrians . 
  you do not get official refugee status for merely * telling * people that you 're from syria - there is a [ bureaucratic process ] ( http://www.bamf.de/de/migration/asylfluechtlinge/asylverfahren/verfahrensablauf/verfahrensablauf-node.html ) which involves a hearing conducted by a trained professional with considerable knowledge about your claimed country of origin . 
  fooling them would only be possible for a very talented and well-informed liar who of course also needs to speak arabic fluently . 
  hmm , did the ira get funding from the soviet union ? 
  some of the other attacks explicitly mentioned ( oktoberfest , bologna ) had a neo nazi background . 
  gez , not gema . 
  totally different thing . 
  then it 's fine , i 'll gladly pay . 
  except those are mostly lies , not facts . 
  actual statistical facts : * males 18-35 : 38 % * females : 32 % * under 16 : 25 % * syrians : 28 % * specifically the syrians have good education , over 20 % university educated , only 10 % have no school education . 
  some are , some are not . 
  they are people , everyone is different . 
  blanket solutions are not appropriate , useful or hones . 
  what if that takes 10 years and by then their kids have grown up in denmark , speak danish better than arabic and are just about to start university ? 
  `` the facts '' , huh ? 
  two problems : * the eu and un could have done that with the syrian refugee camps in jordan , turkey , etc. 
  but the situation in those was pretty disastrous and nobody really cared until people started leaving them and showing up in europe . 
  * people want to live , not be `` kept ready '' while having nothing for years , possibly decades . 
  if you set up long term refugee camps , you are knowingly creating a breeding ground for crime and terrorism . 
  that is * exactly * what happened in gaza . 
  it is indeed not ambiguous , it 's saying the exact opposite of what you want it to say , you 're just too narrowminded to realize it . 
  it is exactly the opposite . 
  they say so very clearly in the editorial of that issue . 
  the charlie hebdo authors have explicitly stated that they mean * exactly * that : our strength is in staying who we are and not giving in to to the warmongering idiocy like your comment . 
  except no , it 's not , and the one who is blind is you . 
  no , that is a misreading . 
  the estimate is 3 million for 2015-2017 total : http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/11/06/eu-projects-three-million-refugees-and-migrants-in-2016/, 
  um no , germany has done the math , that 's what the op report is about . 
  an explanation of the difference is that norway calculated lifetime cost , which is of course going to be high , but spread out over 20 , 30 or even 50 years . 
  and of course the cost of living in norway is pretty much the highest in europe . 
  and * because * many of the refugees are so young , they can learn and become productive , which is going to turn many of them into a net positive for the economy . 
  germany * most definitely * needs workers in the mid to long term . 
  ultimate , it will depend entirely on whether the refugees themselves can become productive members of society . 
  most of them want nothing more than that . 
   more realistic numbers for germany would be 3,5 million refugees a year you have a funny definition of `` realistic '' . 
  and what reason exactly do you have to believe that the norwegian estimate is more correct than the german one ? 
  because it 's higher and you want this to be a disaster so very much ? 
  the german state is prosecuting this man for breaking laws that say he must not allow his platform to publish statements that openly condone mass murder and genocide - which it has , for years , while quite efficiently censoring nipples . 
  this is the sort of behaviour you would expect in any civilized country . 
  i think the implication is that they sometimes do n't get what they want , not that they sometimes use torture . 
  no , and they do n't have to be . 
  for one thing , we 're going to need a lot of construction workers in the short run . 
  craftsmen as well ; car mechanic , plumber , electrician , cook , welder : all useful skills that are actually in demand . 
  plus , a lot of them are young and eager to learn . 
  and more specific to this subthread : germany * most definitely * needs a lot of elderly care nurses in the mid to long term ... 
  except the immigration `` burden '' can really only help wirh the lack of a young working population . 
  with the lights out , at night , once a month . 
  and they do n't enjoy it , of course . 
  because it 's not a top national priority of competing superpowers this time . 
  a lot of people here call their bigotry criticism and whine about the evil pc police ... 
  if there is correllation , then causation is at least a reasonable hypothesis . 
  can you offer an alternative hypothesis that explains the data ? 
  also , your analogies are bullshit . 
  if there 's people who stab themselves with knives all the time and think there 's no problem , then maybe theater knives are not as dangerous as you think !, 
  no , i refuted his point . 
  but if your `` foreseeable future '' consists of less than one year , that is telling in itself . 
  what is it you 're trying to say ? 
  i am indeed saying that there is a pretty strong correllation between being scared and hateful towards any group of people , and having little or no contact with that group of people . 
  with strangers you 've never met , it 's easy to believe that they 're all the same and fundamentally bad . 
  when you actually meet people , you usually notice that they 're quite nice and all individuals . 
  the east german states where pegida originated and has traction are those with the lowest amount of foreign inhabitants by far : http://www.donaukurier.de/storage/pic/afp/journal/eins/1872761_1_xio-fcmsimage-20101028085347-006056-4cc91dfb75d42.photo_1288189287487-4-hd.jpg, 
  it is no exaggeration to say that she has earned true respect and admiration from the population at whole , even her political oppostion , for her handling of this matter . 
  the part where their `` cold stares , big eyebrows '' make `` the hair on my neck stand up '' . 
  they did n't do anything , but the way they look is apparently grounds to fear for the future of the country . 
  make up your mind : has germany never experienced anything like it , or has it already experienced something similar with bad consequences ?
