  these can hardly be both true . 
  and nobody claims the intergration of turks was without problems ( especially since it happened * despite * policies that basically assumed they would all just go back to turkey , rather than deliberate efforts being planned now ) . 
  just that the problems are not even remotely as bad as predicted by the culure wars fanboys . 
  do read the article/translation . 
  it 's about logistics and , you know , the actual reality of having to deal with that many people . 
  yes , it is your head in the sand , because it is * you * who ignores the voices of the people , common sense , facs and statsitics and all around thinking straight . 
  you live in your xenophobic echo chamber and refuse to believe that it 's not an accurate representation of reality . 
  i take it you think the opinion of `` concerned citizens '' who have never actually met a refugee is more important than of people whose job it is to run a city and deal with the real-world logistical and social problems involved in taking in and integrating large numbers of refugees . 
  wrong . 
  local elections in the most populous state nordrhein-westfalen were just last month ( gains for merkel 's cdu , half-indian guy elected mayor of bonn ) , and 2 more states have them next year .

  can you show me any evidence of -25 degrees celsius in a germany city ( or really anywhere non-mountaineous ) ? 
  because i 've lived here all my life and have never experienced that . 
  -20 are possible for a handful of days each winter , and even that has n't happened in the last couple of years . 
  or maybe , just maybe , believing that `` illegal migrants '' are the source of all that 's wrong is not in fact sane . 
  i think you 're confusing germany and russia . 
  no , it 's just in line with all the other insane shit he 's saying . 
   given the high number of samples ( although they might not be entirely representative ) , i really question the official ( state tv ) numbers . 
  seriously ? 
  online polls are the most non-representative thing you can find that is n't outright faked . 
   only the below 1 % we take in while the other continue to suffer from our geopolitical wars , sold weapons and ignorance . 
  is that a reason not to take them in ? 
   we so far did n't even manage to fullfit our 0.1 % bip for aid promisse actually , the target is 0,7 % and germany is at 0,4 %, 
   it ca n't be immediate help for those on the run from the syrian civil war : the influx from the western balkans and from africa ist still greater than the number of syrians coming in ; how does that mean syrians are not or can not be helped ? 
   and even the latter had been cared for by joint international programs of the unhcr before germany started its lonely policy of open immigration . 
  except the `` help '' consisted of having them cooped up in overcrowded camps in terrible conditions with no perspective of improvement or making a living . 
  and yes , that should have been changed first - 3 years ago , but nobody cared until they started coming to europe . 
   it ca n't be compassion , either : the vast majority of these people have no knowledge of the german language , let alone marketable skills . 
  you seem to have a very strange idea of what `` compassion '' means . 
  and people can learn languages and skills , especially when they are young and motivated . 
  many of these people want nothing more than to go to school and make a living . 
   germans are therefore condemning them to a life between dependency , poverty and crime . 
  which is exactly what they had in the refugee camps in lebanon , jordan and turkey . 
  but it 's ok if it happens somewhere we ca n't see ? 
  in germany , they have a chance to do much better . 
  what she wants is for germany 's constitution and its professed principles to * mean * something rather than being conveniently forgotten as soon as it takes an effort to follow them . 
  if you want a maximum number , make a suggestion . 
  one with concrete , rational reasons behind it . 
  no we love our country so much that we 're not willing to turn it into a shit place because of some scaremongering idiots . 
  that question from an american ? 
  seriously ? 
  30 % is a * huge * minority , not a small fraction . 
  i was talking about `` from war torn countries '' . 
  between 30 % and 40 % of refugees which come to germany get official refugee status , which means they did indeed come from war-torn countries . 
  30 + % is now `` a small fraction '' ? 
  jan hus was . 
  giordano bruno was . 
  and it was not at all a given that luther would n't be when he published his theses . 
  well , as people love to point out , a lot of them are young , healthy males with limited education . 
  we 'll have no shortage of construction workers . 
  as for the low deportation rate - that 's in large part because there were n't too many to cause serious problem , so the efforts were limited . 
  that 's another thing that will most likely change : http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-09/bundestag-angela-merkel-wirtschaftsfluechtlinge-abschiebung, 
  the discussion was about `` a poor hamburgian enterpreneur '' , and there 's definitely two factors in there that are n't compatible with speculatively buying large buildings : `` poor '' ( because , no money ) and `` enterpreneur '' , which is someone owning and running a business , which means they spend money on things that * definitely * help their business * now * , not things they might need someday . 
  it 's clearly you who does not read the comments you 're replying to . 
  the `` simple circumstance '' was a bizarre hypothetical case where an entrepreneur buys a large building ( that 's what we 're tallking about , small stuff is irrelevant for the purpose ) he * might * need because it 's cheap at the moment . 
  if you have that kind of money to throw around on a whim , you are not an entrepreneur , kinda by definition . 
   what kind of a kick back does the property owner receive for this ` borrowing ' ? 
  the amount of compensation is `` determined by the responsible agency using equitable discretion and guided by local standards at the time of the claim '' . 
  i hope i got all the legalese right . 
  it 's pretty vague so that it can cover many different cases . 
  if a property owner thinks the compensation is too low , they can go to court , where the judge will have to decide based on the law . 
   and is it the govt that decides how long the property will be seized for ? 
  the law explicitly limits itself ( including all claims ) to march 2017 . 
  i forgot to mention the possibly most important point : this is temporary , the owner keeps the property and is compensated for the usage . 
  if you * still * consider it insane , then it looks like you value the principle of property rights in itself higher than people 's lives . 
  and that is something * i * consider insane , and dangerously so . 
  pretty much every country has the concept of eminent domain , where properties are seized permanently , and for less grave reasons ( infrastructure projects ) . 
  it 's getting insane because you want it to be and are not willing to look too closely when things confirm what you already are convinced of . 
  the law in question allows seizing * temporarily , with appropriate compensation * commercial property * that is currently unused * to prevent an immediate danger of people being denied shelter * if and when the city 's capacity to acquire or construct shelter sufficiently quickly is exceeded, 
   based on this fact alone , i 'm inclined to believe the outraged citizens are a very tiny minority who are n't worth pandering to . 
  and you 'd be largely right , though there is also a growing number of citizens who , while not outraged and in principle willing to help and accept refugees , are concerned whether the current policies are sustainable . 
  sure . 
  but 99 % of actual entrepreneurs do not have the kind of money it takes to speculatively buy real estate . 
  the `` poor old hamburgian entrepreneur '' mentioned upthread is simply not going to be affected by this law . 
  for those who read german : here is the actual text of the proposed law : https://www.buergerschaft-hh.de/parldok/dokument/49868/entwurf-eines-gesetzes-zur-fl%c3%bcchtlingsunterbringung-in-einrichtungen.pdf interesting detail : the law is time-limited until march 2017 - seized properties have to be released by then . 
  obviously , this could be extended , but that is not the intention . 
  that 's not entrepreneurship , that 's real estate speculation . 
  that 's rich , coming from someone whose country has [ labskaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labskaus ), 
  more like gastrointestinal cleansing ... 
  awesome piece of journalism !, 
  from what i 've heard , the typical scenario is this : * swedish dad decides that the family should have a traditional surstr\u00f6mming dinner . 
  * all the ingredients are bought , everything is prepared * the first surstr\u00f6mming can is opened , everyone takes a sniff * surstr\u00f6mming goes straight into the trash * mom cooks hamburgare , at least she can use the onions . 
  it 's still a shithole to live in but hey , now it 's * relevant * !, 
  sadly , that kind of thing works . 
  yes , that would typically be the basis on which the decision is made . 
  neither the law itself not the fact that it is worded like that makes a statement about how many youths have that ability . 
  it defines the elements of the offense , it 's up to the court to decide whether the element of `` exploiting a lacking ability of sexual self-determination '' exists for every specific case . 
  that 's pretty meaningless in this particular case . 
  for sexual relationships between 14-15 year olds and someone older than 21 , it 's basically up to the judge ( with input from e.g. 
  a psychologist ) to decide whether the youth was exploited or mature enough to decide for themselves . 
  there is . 
  stgb \u00a7 182 explicitly makes it a crime to exploit the `` missing ability of sexual self-determination '' of a 14-15 year old . 
  but it requires the court to determine whether that is what actually happened in a case , i.e. 
  it leaves open the possibility that some 14-15 year olds * do * have that ability . 
  it certainly does not mean what * you * are implying either . 
   yes , it does . 
  the state should n't pry into upbringing in family , unless it 's hurts the rights of the child . 
  that 's exactly what this is about : the refusal of the parents to let their child go on this trip hurts the right of their child to have a well-rounded education .
