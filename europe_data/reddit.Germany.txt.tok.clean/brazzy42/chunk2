  and the point is that `` allah hu akbar '' , to speakers of arabic , is a common everyday phrase that they use in a great variety of circumstances , often without being consciously aware of its religious meaning , just like `` oh my god '' is used in english . 
  it 's used by * football commentators * to express amazement . 
  essentially , it means `` i am excited '' . 
  of course the average non-muslim only knows that `` it 's what terrorists shout '' and everyone who uses it must therefore be a terrorist or at least an extremist . 
  which is complete nonsense and caused by extremely selective perception . 
  considering places where people are stoned as representative of the whole muslim world is the same kind of `` fucking non sense '' . 
  um , that 's because it basically * is * random punctuation in arabic . 
  does frequent use of `` oh my god '' mean the speaker is a fundamentalist christian ? 
  german here . 
  i think my closest experience with guns was when a friend of my uncle in sweden took me and my cousin to go hunting . 
  but we did n't spot any game and no shots were fired . 
  i do n't remember if he let us hold the rifle . 
  the 800k estimate actually * includes * families as well . 
  generally , you can assume that anything shared on facebook is fake , unless it either links to an original source or is completely boring . 
   it john cleese , man !, 
  except it 's not . 
   found it on fb http://efunnyphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/funny-albert-einstein-famous-quote.jpg, 
  yes , it 's easy and stupid and it 's what you are doing . 
  stop the victim complex whining and if you voice your concerns in a rational and decent manner , you can have a reasonable debate . 
  but not when you deliberately place yourself with the people who openly condone genocide - because * those * are the ones who get `` named and shamed '' in reality . 
  easy solution to that . 
  `` why , thank you !, 
  you build them , we 'll staff them . '', 
  here 's one in munich which i kinda like : http://cdn.foravisit.com/_munich/_/100435/i/w2000/moschee_pasing.jpg though i 'm pretty sure it 's a modified existing building . 
  apparently everything that 's not pure neo-nazi hatemongering is `` left-wing '' to you ... 
  you 're actually proving my point quite nicely . 
  no , actually i have not seen that , except for stuff that actually * is * racist , xenophobic , or whatever . 
  those words have a well defined meaning , you know ? 
  what i * have * seen is a massive amount of victim complex whining about `` political correctness '' and `` evil leftists silencing opposin opinions by calling them racist '' . 
  so basically you let yourself be brainwashed by right wing hate propaganda sites ? 
  this is a bullshit victim complex tactic that people on the right love to use . 
  nobody has to fear voicing their opinion privately or in the workplace as long as they are even remotely reasonable . 
  what people get defriended and fired for is not `` i do n't think we should take in that many refugees '' , it 's `` 71 refugees found dead in a truck ? 
  good riddance of that subhuman scum , and we should build some gas chambers again ! '', 
  they * are * war refugees , and that does n't change because you 've convinced yourself that wanting to work for a living rather than being dependant on food handouts in gigantic , cramped refugee camps is somehow reprehensible . 
  the one who is pretending is you . 
  different question . 
  this is about why people might want to go to sweden when they are already in germany , which treats them pretty well . 
  but yeah , i understand that for some people , the only explanation they will accept is `` these are ingrate criminals looking for the most exploitable welfare system and the most rapeable women '' . 
  i 'm not defending anything , i am merely pointing out that not conforming to a clich\u00e9 image of a destitute refugee or not being content because they are given * something * is not particularly horribly behaviour . 
  looks like you guys are just completely incapable of letting go of your prejudices or feeling any empathy . 
  very good question . 
  the whole damn article does n't even try to answer it by , you know , * asking * them . 
  possible explanation : these people have relatives or friends who live in sweden . 
  i wonder how long * you * would be happy `` just not being murdered today '' ... 
  how dare they not fit your self-contradicting requirements of what a poor refugee is supposed to look like ? 
  try to stop wallowing in clich\u00e9s and right-wing hate propaganda , and engage your brain for a change : * have * you * seen actual news footage ? 
  yes , there are young men . 
  so what ? 
  there are also old men . 
  and women , young and old , and children . 
  * healthy , young , educated , willing to work ? 
  great !, 
  so they 'll pay taxes and * support * the welfare system rather than just benefitting from it !, 
  that 's actually exactly what we need , especially in germany . 
  they 're welcome to send some money back after paying taxes . 
  * so being young , healthy and educated makes it impossible to be poor or terrified ? 
  if * you * had your home destroyed by bombs , killing your parents , and your brother abducted and murdered , would your age and health somehow make you not poor or terrified ? 
  * nice clothes and a phone are things that make you `` not poor '' even though you 've lost everything else ? 
  you want them to sell those for food ? 
  and then what ? 
  actually , clothes and a phone are exactly the things you 'll want to hang on to when making your way through foreign countries where you may have to sleep outside . 
  poe 's law is all to relevant in this debate . 
  in your imagination , not in reality . 
  except those `` categories '' are a cherry-picked story that you 're telling yourself . 
  you really need to learn some history . 
  greeks -  romans is basically conquerors adopting some important knowledge from the people they conquered . 
  so why not arabs -  spanish ? 
  because pretty much the same thing happened there . 
  and romans -  christianity ? 
  um , they did n't exactly invent it . 
  it came from the same place that islam came from later . 
  so they have the same root as well . 
  it is indeed you who is blinded by emotions , namely hate , judging a whole people on acts committed by a few ( and then cherry-picked and taken out of context by the right-wing echo chamber ) . 
  what someone deserves depends on the actions ( and situation ) of that specific person , not on the actions of others who look like them or have the same language or religion . 
  oh , and seriously ? 
  people can not be innocent , terrified or starving because they have smartphones ? 
  are you really that dumb ? 
  that 's a pretty lame definition of `` destroying the island '' . 
  i was thinking more of pickaxes and making it vanish into the sea !, 
  very little of europe was ruled by greece . 
  southern spain , cyprus and , oh , malta , were ruled by arab muslims at some point . 
  your concept of a `` european culture '' that is somehow clearly separate from other cultures is simply complete nonsense . 
  no , it shows what is to be expected if you were to keep them in cramped prison camps with no hope or perspective for improvement . 
  your logic : roman rule of and early christianity in syria are irrelevant and they `` are n't culturally derived from greece any more . 
  they are culturally derived from the arab peninsula . '', 
  by that same logic , germany is not `` culturally derived from greece any more . '', 
  because there have been more recent different influences . 
  it actually goes deeper : most of germany was actually never ruled by rome at all . 
  nope : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/chili, 
  oh , you poor opressed minority , you !, 
  source or it did n't happen ... 
  dude , the retarded kid who has no idea of history , that 's you . 
  you have that backwards . 
  skinheads attacking refugee shelters * was * daily news some weeks ago . 
  the current massive support of refugees and the government stance towards them is the backlash to that . 
  no , they will face a rather unrealistic task ... 
  well , they are being really , really shitty hosts . 
  this is desperation , not the kind of super-evil ingratitude that the racist assholes here are all imagining ( probably taking cues from their own personality ) . 
  25 % , which is not exactly `` quite rare '' .
