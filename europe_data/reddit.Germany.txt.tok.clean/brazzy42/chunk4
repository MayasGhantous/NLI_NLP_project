  that 's where the conflict arises . 
   this has nothing to do with disallowing a core practice of a religious community . 
  yes , it does , because unfortunately jews believe that it 's required to be performed on boys shortly after birth . 
   religions have always adapted to the world around them . 
  yes , there is a ( small , at this point ) part of the reform judaism movement which has abolished circumcision . 
  and the jewish faith is quite adaptable in principle . 
  this would be the easiest solution of the dilemma . 
   also it does n't just have to do with religious freedom but with it just being a cultural thing . 
  in america it 's mostly performed for cultural reason ( s ) if i 'm not mistaken . 
  yes , that 's kinda stupid , but can hopefully be fixed with education . 
   furthermore , i do n't see why someone 's religion should have to affect someone else 's genitals . 
  the biggest problem is that many adherents of the jewish faith consider male circumcision a * hard requirement * of being a member of the religion . 
  if a boy is not circumcised , he 's not a full jew ( and doing it later does not really erase the transgression ) . 
  so banning it comes pretty close to banning the religion itself in their eyes . 
  and of course lacking this basic requirement also harms the child in that view - a view the child is quite likely to share when he 's grown up . 
  at a point that has been determined after careful consideration of all factors , and hopefully without resorting to myopic arguments that boil down to `` i do n't like it , so you should n't be allowed to do it ! '', 
  basically yes - weigh the harm done by doing a minor surgical procedure ( with its potential for dangerous complications ) against the harm done by disallowing a core practice of a religious community ( of which the child is , after all , a member ) . 
  but it 's not a decision that should be done lightly . 
  we 're not talking about killing , though . 
  because religious freedom is also considered pretty damn important due to past experiences with societies that tried to ban some or all religions . 
  even in today 's enlightened societies , religion is very important to many ( often quite sane and intelligent ) people . 
  so if you have religions that require boys to be circumcised to be considered part of the religious community , you have a direct conflict of basic rights which you can not simply resolve by declaring that the right * you * do n't care about is less important . 
  i hear they 're prioritizing signage . 
  yeah , if they 'd just waited a little and let us pass through to france , there would n't have been any problems !, 
  you many want to inform yourself a bit more about the history . 
  no , no , we want to keep the french !, 
  at least the women . 
  and the cooks . 
  well , we were only visiting belgium as well back in 1914 , and then everyone started to make a big fuss about it !, 
   bavarians hating prussians ( often referring to the rest of germany - german `` foreigners '' ) to a true bavarian , everything outside the wei\u00dfwurst\u00e4quator is prussia . 
  well , i 'm not one of those people , but as an outside observer , it seems many of them feel a sense of community with others who are discrinimated against for similar reason , and it makes sense to have a name or label for this community . 
  and i doubt you 'll find many people who agree that sexuality and gender are completely unrelated ... 
  kinda disingenious to bring that up with a term specifically invented as a self-designation by people who suffer from * not * being considered equal in many cases . 
  except the rest-afd now has major problems with the `` no neo-nazi affiliation '' criterium . 
  plus i suspect they 're not nearly done with infighting . 
   and i do n't think the afd will go away anytime soon . 
  after the recent split , it 's dead as a doornail . 
   there are a lot of potential voters for a real national-conservative party . 
  especially with the recent mass-immigration of muslims and rising crime in many parts of the country . 
  yes , and they 'll all flock to the next `` seriously conservative , * for realz * this time ! '', 
  party that comes along in a year or two . 
  i 'm partial to quiltbag - at least it 's pronouncable and kinda cute . 
   if you 're good at something and have fun with it , become a professional in it , and even if it 's high speed stacking . 
  in times of yt you can definitely make a living out of that stuff not if there are 5000 others who do the same and are just as good . 
  that 's also the problem with art history degrees : not that * some * people do economically unproductive but intellectually stimulating stuff , but that * too many * people do it , far more than there are paying jobs in that field . 
  as a german whose parents were both born after the war , i still think that accepting * responsibility * ( not personally , but nationally ) for the crimes of nazi germany is a good thing and has served us well and earned us a lot of respect . 
  the same people who whine about being held responsible for something they did n't do are usually quick to cheer and go crazy about how `` we '' won the world cup and are `` export world champions '' . 
  looks like they 're totally ok with collective responsibility when it 's about something good ... stop raising picking !, 
  if you 're going to have a national identity , own in completely , the bad parts as well as the good !, 
  it does n't mean you have to support israel unconditionally , just be a bit more careful about criticism than anyone else would be . 
  senior software engineer in munich . 
  gross : $ 5500 taxes : $ -1369 social security : $ -596 health insurance : $ -393 net : $ 3141 rent + heating : $ -930 other fixed monthly expenses : $ -537 this leaves me with $ 1674 for food , irregular expenses , holidays and other entertainment , and retirement savings . 
  that 's enough so that i do n't really have to think about budgeting day-to-day . 
  i do consider this a valuable luxury in itself . 
  the problem : next person says `` it 's not child abuse to give the occasional slap in the face when they did something bad '' . 
  and the next says that [ paddling ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/17/school-district-ban-paddling-rural-areas-defend/12421465/ ) is obviously a sound educational technique . 
  and another [ cites scripture ] ( http://twelvetribes.org/articles/please-dont-tell-me-to-hate-my-child ) claiming that beating disobedient children with rods is morally good . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  because it 's only proper german if it 's shouted angrily !, 
  [ schmetterling !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xuidrxdmc ), 
  since you 're the third person to answer in this vein , i have to ask : what 's supposed to be particularly offensive about that , to greeks or whomever ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  well , they had [ this one guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_the_great ) , some time ago , i think he sent home a few odds and ends ... 
  only one of them was really seriously injured , but not life-threatening . 
  so she 'll probably recover fully . 
  yes , according to this : http://www.heute.at/sport/sportmix/art23665,1170832 one suffered multiple fractures , another a broken arm . 
  it does sound as if the first athlete 's injuries are not expected to be life-threatening . 
  your source shows something else , but not the national wealth fund . 
  my source for that : http://old.minfin.ru/en/nationalwealthfund/statistics/amount/index.php?id_4=5830, 
   if that truly was the case the russian government could simply invest their sovereign wealth fund selling or even shorting oil futures bull - * and * cowshit !, 
  the fund contained about $ 90billion prior to the war , while oil exports were worth $ 350billion * per year * and accounted for over 60 % of the country 's exports , with taxes related to the industry making up 50 % of the federal revenue . 
  the oil price droping really is a massive * massive * problem for russia . 
   sounds like you think what your government/media wants you to think . 
  russians do like putin . 
  the irony in someone combining these two statements at face value is delicious . 
  know what 's funny ? 
  those greek soldiers are * exactly * what i had in mind as a rebuke to that type of response ... 
  austrian demands were explicitly designed to be unacceptable and a cause for war . 
  if the warmongering * was * significantly stronger on one side , it was not the triple entente . 
  they 're a traditional local costume that 's somehow also become a caricature and ( more recently ) a fashion for specific occasions . 
  the traditionalists do n't care about caricature and will only grumble about the fashion if it 's done cheaply and unfaithfully . 
  note though that the straw is what caused most of that huge flame ( and partially burned down a few houses ) . 
  no , a wider definition will result in a constantly higher number of cases . 
  the airport means that it 's easier/cheaper to get to , and both mean that the city is simply more well-known by name than any other german city except berlin . 
  my theory is that frankfurt attracts tourists who chose their destination in germany by length/price of flight or superficial familiarity of the name . 
  - do a cruise on the rhine ( or a bike tour along it ) north of bingen/r \u00fcdesheim . 
  if you do only one thing on this list , this is it . 
  - visit w\u00fcrzburg ( nice city with a palace and a huge castle ) - wertheim ( charming small town , also with a castle above it ) - rothenburg ob der tauber ( a bith further away , but quite famous for its medieval old town and the well-preserved city wall ) - heidelberg , yet another beautiful old town - do a tour of the opel automobile plant in r\u00fcsselsheim - hiking in the taunus or spessart nature reserves, 
  not because it 's horrible , but because it seems to attract quite a lot of tourists ( probably due to its fame as a financial center and having the biggest airport ) when there are so much better alternatives . 
  that 's pretty much what is being done . 
  cute . 
  but the means to prevent the people from drowning immediately is different from integrating them as immigrants permanently . 
  also , `` they '' in the second sentence was `` italy or europe '' ( your words ) . 
  no , i 'm not proposing that . 
  a genuine fix would be wonderful . 
  there are in fact lots of ongoing attempts , and have been for a long time . 
  some have resulted in considerable improvements , others have been counterproductive . 
  but the overcrowded boats in the mediterranean are there * right now * , and a problem that needs a solution . 
  and a solution that involves letting people drown , starve or freeze is imo not acceptable .
