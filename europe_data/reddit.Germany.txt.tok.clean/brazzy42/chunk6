  training on them is also considered a great way to `` build character '' . 
  otoh , then you could have said `` well , at least i quit smoking , got that out of it '' . 
  how do you think the parents will feel when the cards keep coming 10 years after their daughter is dead and buried ? 
  if you do it near a church and loud enough , it would be a misdemeanour incurring a fine of up to $ 10k , same as holding public entertainment events . 
  * private * dancing is in fact not banned . 
  no , but maybe burning chemtrail stuff can ? 
  clearly , yes . 
  if they actually harassed people , yes . 
  from what i heard they were quite polite . 
  no , because they do n't count as `` intimidating '' , since everyone just bursts out laughing when they hear that tough comic book name . 
  if that were all there is to it , a lot of little old ladies would be in big trouble . 
  that sounds a lot like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld_conspiracy, 
  / r/germany is for discussions in english about germany . 
  / r/de is for discussions in german about anything and everything ( de is the country and language code for germany ) . 
  / r/kreiswichs is for people who never get tired of literal mistranslations of english memes . 
  this is the most fucking idiotic thing i 've read all day . 
  are you a moron ? 
  unless they 've been living in a very isolated environment , yes , they know very well that there are boys and girls and they 're supposed to look different and like different toys . 
  not yet , see my comment https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4fbzlo/how_does_prostitution_work_in_your_country/d28odsj, 
  not yet . 
  the current government is still working on the details for a new prostitution law which will most likely ban `` degrading '' business practices which would include such offers . 
  it 's scheduled to be passed next year . 
  that 's all chickenshit compared with what they did to the 2009 time 100 poll : http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/time-magazine-throws-up-its-hands-as-it-gets-pwned-by-4chan/ not just get your candidate to the top , but also spell out a message with the initials of the next 20 ? 
  that 's just kinda impossible to top . 
  that 's not a particularly unusual situation on the high seas . 
  you just ride it out . 
  as long as your engines are running and you can avoid being hit by the waves sideways , the worst that will happen to you is that you may become reacquainted with your last meal . 
  because current-day czechia is bigger than the historical bohemia and also includes moravia and parts of silesia . 
  changing the titles of posts is unfortunately not supported by reddit, 
  it 's still relevant that it was not stated on its own but as an example , and that it 's so exaggerated as to be absurd and hard to take serious - this stuff really matters juristically . 
   yes , under the same laws of insulting a private citizen . 
  no , it 's a different section of the law . 
  the criteria are the same , but the sentences are higher and it requires the german government explicitly authorizes the prosecution of the case . 
  and that is a rather silly law to have . 
   i really do n't get why this is such a huge deal - people in the us get fined for showing nipples on tv , b\u00f6hmermann is going to get fined for saying someone fucks goats and watches child pornography . 
  it 's a bit more complicated because he actually said that erdogan was wrong about a different piece of political satire being an insult , and to illustrate he would give an example of what a * real * personal insult looks like . 
  she does n't just have a chance , she is actually almost guaranteed to become chancellor again . 
   this is what he did and he is being punished , according to the same libel/slander laws the us has , in germany . 
  part of this `` scandal '' is that germany has a separate law to punish insults to foreign heads of state . 
  of course it did n't because saddam was a * bad guy * !, 
  torture , multilation and killing are perfectly fine and healthy if the victim * deserves * it !, 
  fuck , i 'm feeling old now . 
  do n't laugh , you 'll be the same one day when you see someone writing `` taylor swift ? 
  i had to look her up . '', 
  whereas in germany , it 's 50 % after 5 years . 
  what is sweden doing wrong ?

  well , that kinda depends on whether you think that not having sex with anyone else is really * the * foundation of a relationship . 
  though i suppose the phrasing `` fucking foundation '' is hilariously appropriate if you do think so . 
  no , you have to do with it that you apparently still want to have a relationship with the mother , or what else is `` even good people make mistakes '' supposed to mean ? 
  that was exactly my point : the problem is with the cheating , not the child . 
  if you still view the mother as a good person , you have no more basis for not accepting the child as if it were from a previous relationship . 
  yes . 
  and asking a real question . 
  and even a child who made no mistake at all is worthless to you because it was n't you their good mom was fucking when she got pregnant ? 
  and what exactly makes it a not-good relationship ? 
  so basically the same situation as trusting the girlfriend not to cheat for years and sudenly needing a test when she 's pregnant . 
  it has * everything * to do with the girlfriend and nothing whatsoever with the child . 
  um , pretty much every economical analysis of germany stresses how it 's dominated by small , family-owned businesse as well , you know ? 
   power in canada averages about $ 0.04 - $ 0.07 / kwh which is apparently almost 1/10th the cost of electricity in some parts of the eu . 
  i * really * do n't think so . 
  germany has very expensive electricity because it 's used to subsidize extremely ambitious renewable energy programs , and it 's still no more than $ 0.25 / kwh, 
  that 's some horrible nonsense right there . 
  yeah , you 'll be consuming less energy * at that moment * when maintaining a temperature than when changing to it from a very different temperature - but you consume * no energy at all * while the ac is switched off . 
  a long time of no consumption + a short time running at full blast = still less than a long time of low consumption . 
  there is actually no scenario at all where switching the ac off * does n't * save you energy , even for a short time , because the energy loss to the environment is proportional to the temperature difference . 
  more like ignorant and stupid . 
  anyone else remember the `` old europe '' thing ? 
  and the funniest thing about that video is that he is * actually * the son of a police officer . 
  was n't it [ over 4000 ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/555434/islamic-state-isis-smuggler-thousands-extremists-into-europe-refugees ) a few months ago ? 
  at this rate , there wo n't be any of them left in a week or two !, 
  i would n't say that . 
  targeted assassinations of people who are particularly hated by the group in question are n't unheard of . 
  the german raf group did a few of those in the 70s . 
  that 's because `` darkness a regular human mind can conjure up '' is * by definition * a human thing . 
  you 've never actually seen what animals do with each other , have you ? 
  let 's find out ... ... preferably in a cage match . 
  not necessarily , we'also had good experiences with france . 
  their food is better anyway . 
  yes , germany has same-sex civil unions , which have been incrementally getting assigned more of the same privileges as marriage by constitutional court decisions , but not yet regular marriage . 
  oh look , someone 's claiming that anything that does n't confirm their opinion must be a lie . 
  again . 
  noone takes you fucking serious . 
  the first of those accounts for about 70k as far as authorities know , and most of the rest are doing nothing illegal , they just registered in a different location than they were originally assigned to , e.g. 
  because they have distant relatives somewhere . 
  basically it 's an artifact of imperfect bookeeping for the most part . 
  the only thing the german government has lost control of is statistics . 
  there are no 140k `` vanished '' people , there are just some numbers that do n't add up . 
  people were counted when first arriving in germany , for the purpose of distributing them , but identified and registered only after the distribution . 
  if they do n't go where planned before registering , they count as `` vanished '' . 
  it 's not something you can simply do immediately to solve the current problem . 
  it would take years to get organized and have the intended effect, 
  the time for that was 3 or 4 years ago , but back then it was just too easy to ignore the problem . 
   the processing of asylum claims needs to be dramatically expedited . 
  and this is exactly what is being done , but it 's not something you can ramp up instantly . 
  the bamf has already increased the number of people processing asylum requests from 550 to 1800 , and recently they 're trying to get experienced post office workers to switch to that job temporarily : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlinge-bamf-will-300-post-beamte-als-asylentscheider-einstellen-a-1078491.html, 
  economic warfare . 
  see how long you can survive if we starve you of ski tourists and stop buying your chocolate !, 
  wrong . 
  it 's a proven medical fact that alcohol is the far worse poison , both short term and long term .
