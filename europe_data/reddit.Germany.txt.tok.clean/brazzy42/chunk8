  no crime wave . 
  not a single case of sexual harassment . 
  everything works reasonably well , thanks in part to local voulunteers . 
  in fact , it 's a bit boring . 
  know what their biggest problem is ? 
  anonymous threats from neonazis and racists , from as far away as the usa . 
  much , much lower than the percentage of angrily and loudly expressed opinion combined with a martyr complex ( `` look at me defying the evil pc police !!!, 
  on a country scale , you * never * have complete control . 
  it 's not even possible . 
  what 's apparent is that the author of that article has absolutely no interest in truth , responsible journalism , or objective debate , just in spewing his clich\u00e9-filled polemic . 
  in reality , germany has a big problem with understaffed and underfunded police forces , stretched to the breaking point * because * of political kneejerk reactions to high profile cases and `` tough on crime '' politicians pushing more work on the police while at the same time slashing their funding : http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/polizei--die-ohnmacht-der-beamten-6656352.html, 
  the herculean task of providing shelter for all these people and spreading them out across germany has been overall managed pretty damn well . 
  no people sleeping rough in crowded camps , as happened on the balkans . 
  edcuation : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/germany-recruits-8500-teachers-to-teach-german-to-196000-child-refugees http://www.hrk.de/hrk-international/refugees/#c15349, 
  except the notion of a big coordinated press coverup across europe is the real lie , a tool used by right-wingers to paint themselves as opressed heroes . 
  the press has covered every possible aspect of this . 
  not everywhere immediately and perfectly , and certainly not all in agreement , but you know that 's what `` free and independant press '' * means * , right ? 
  that they can and will decide differently about what and how to report . 
   not a single thing that has been managed right or even decently bullshit . 
  because there is absolutely no middle ground between `` in complete control '' and `` lost control '' ? 
  wrong . 
  it broke first on established local media and then very rapidly spread to all the others . 
  so edgy !, 
  neither in germany nor in sweden was there any censorship of the press . 
  all that happened in sweden was that the police failed to publish some information and in germany not even that , just a premature `` nothing big happened '' when the scale of events was not yet clear to anyone . 
  the blog i linked to has its data from the bamf , the german agency responsible for registering refugees . 
  and the numbers actually agree pretty closely - they 're just listing different subsets . 
  definitely much less than 75 % men . 
  ah , a number you just state with no source and which is probably lifted off some blow which embellished it a bit after taking it from somewhere else where the same thing was doen `` can not be argued '' , eh ? 
  a * fact * is that of the refugees registered in germany , almost a quarter are younger than 16 , almost a third are female , and only 38 % are men between 18 and 35 , and many of those are probably married . 
  the 50 % besch\u00e4ftigungsquote is from the source i linked to in my original comment several levels up ( specifically the graph on page 10 ) : http://doku.iab.de/aktuell/2015/aktueller_bericht_1514.pdf, 
  main points of the article : * german authorities received multiple warnings from different sources , such as a us , french and iraqi intelligence agencies , and kurdish informers . 
  * some of these were specific in time , place and came with a list of names of potential perpetrators . 
  one received from france caused the decision to have munich 's two main stations evacuated over new year 's eve * it turns out that most of these warnings lead back to a single source , an iraqi ex-intelligence officer . 
  * this man is considered a dependable informer by the fbi , but they stopped working with him because he demanded too much money . 
  * police in munich have not found anything to corroborate the warnings , neither explosives or guns , nor any of the named suspects . 
  * an analysis from the german federal police now calls the warnings `` rather unlikely '' . 
  they 're considering the possibility that it was deliberate disinformation spread by isis . 
  exactly , nor should they be expected to be . 
  but that 's what people are saying when they compare a 50 % employment rate of refugees to a 4.5 % unemployment rate of germans . 
  * edit : the 50 % number for refugees does not include all refugees , only those of working age . 
  the comparable number for german citizens is 71 % as of 2010 [ source ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/9789264125476-de/07/01/01/index.html?contenttype=&amp;itemid=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2f9789264125469-58-de&amp;mimetype=text%2fhtml&amp;containeritemid=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f23073764&amp;accessitemids= ) *, 
  see my replies to the 3 or 4 identical replies . 
  not really , see my replies to the 3 or 4 identical replies . 
  because children , students , the elderly , disabled people and housewives are not counted towards unemployment . 
  no , it is not . 
  nor are other comparisons that are not thusly adjusted . 
  and the sub-18 segment is almost one third , source : http://www.bildblog.de/73416/wie-falsche-bilder-von-fluechtlingen-entstehen/, 
  a whole lot more than 1 out of 8 , is it not ? 
  and actually not much worse than the natives . 
  where does it say so ? 
  not having a job is not the same thing as unemployed . 
  the general german population does only a little better ( 53 % ) .

   what percent are n't receiving government aid at that point ? 
  the paper contains no information on that . 
   in germany can you have a job but still need welfare ? 
  yes , if the job pays less than the welfare rate , but the paper does give an average income which is considerably above that . 
  sure , and the same is true for refugees . 
  population of germany : 80.6 million , source : everywhere number of people in gainful employment in germany : 43.4 million , source : https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesamtwirtschaftumwelt/arbeitsmarkt/erwerbstaetigkeit/erwerbstaetigkeit.html * edit : the 50 % number for refugees does not include all refugees , only those of working age .

  well , the keyword is * employable population * - not every refugee is employable , just like not every swede is . 
  can you give a source for that `` break even point '' thing ? 
  because 75 % is a really high percentage , given that you 'll have housewives and old people . 
  i suspect that you 're thinking of utilization figures for employees , but that is a * completely different thing * . 
  pretty good , given that the figure is about 53 % for the entirety of the german population .

  downvoters : you * really * hate to see facts that do n't fit your preconceptions , eh ? 
  or maybe , just maybe the german people have a better idea what actually goes on in their country than some random dude from bumbelch , nebrahoma who choose the news he watches primarily by what gives him a hate boner . 
  can someone please point out where the goddamn fuck there 's supposed to be a cover-up ? 
  because this has been the number one hot topic pretty much everywhere , for days . 
  as far as i am concerned , anyone claiming a coverup instantly proves themselves a delusional racist idiot who ca n't let go of their goddamn victim complex . 
  that 's the most absurd bullshit claim ever . 
  unless by your standards anything that 's not explicit calls for lynch justice and genocide cunts as `` feel-good happy '' . 
  literally : `` europe must get together and close its borders to all '', 
  effectively , it is you who pays it because it 's part of what your employers pays to have you as an employee , and assuming that the total amount is what drives their position in salary negotiations , it would be paid to you if it were n't earmarked for insurance . 
  you consider turkey part of europe then ? 
  work on your reading comprehension . 
  the statement i replied to was `` we could lose the ` returning jihadis ' from the end of that sentence . 
  '' , which means `` europe must get together and close its borders to all '' . 
  your `` proposal '' would destroy europe 's culture , identity and future far , far worse than any migrants . 
  and we ware competent enough to run our nations and deal with migrants as well , as we have done constantly throughout the centuries . 
  please read the comment i replied to and think about what it is actually saying . 
  this is the most short-sighted and idiotic thing i 've read all day . 
  ah , so you do n't like having any kind of functioning economy and the freedom to travel the world ? 
  [ no , he did n't . 
  ] ( http://study.com/academy/lesson/history-of-the-belgian-congo-imperialism-genocide-atrocities.html ), 
  please learn some actual history . 
  for the comedy value ? 
  cool story , bro . 
  an important thing that people from europe tend not to understand about police in the usa is that you can not make * any * meaningful statements about all of them , because there are police forces at every level , from the federal fbi down to the county - or city-level sheriff departments . 
  and all of them can be organized differently , have different procedures , different traditions , different leadership . 
   the only people in the us who fear the police are criminals you are adorably naive , and breathtakingly wrong . 
  which , even if true , has absolutely nothing to do with current day issues . 
  so , according to several german newspapers , this is what is currently known : * there had been warnings of planned terror attacks in the preceding days , but too vague to warrant concrete measures . 
  * then there was a concrete warning , which came from a french intelligence agency . 
  * it included an exact time , place , and a list of names and nationalities of the perpetrators .
