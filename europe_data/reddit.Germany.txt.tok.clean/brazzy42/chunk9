  * so far it has not been verified whether this plan ( or even the people on the list ) actually existed . 
  yes , it 's actual logic based on reality and facts rather than ignorance , hate and magical thinking . 
  what i am saying is that terrorists have killed only a tiny fraction of the number of people that despotic rulers have killed . 
  true that . 
  a few months ago , i was waiting for the subway at marienplatz and heard a woman scream `` help , police '' - could n't see what was actually happening , but within less than 30 seconds , a 6-pack of police in riot gear came running , with 2 more squads arriving a minute or two later . 
  i think it means `` i do n't understand democracy '' . 
   deregulate our banks even harder and now i 'm stuck with the mental image of a guy in a three piece suit bent over a huge stack of money and begging a politician holding a rolled-up manila folder , `` yes , baby , deregulate me , yes !, 
  deregulate me * harder !, 
  * ** harder !!, 
  ** '' f. . . deregulate you !, 
   one of those wants to kill me for my hedonistic lifestyle and the other does n't except you 're wrong - nationalists have a long history of killing people they deem `` denegerate '' for whatever reason . 
  try being gay in russia these days ... 
  hmmm ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aum_shinrikyo, 
  yes , they are a * much * bigger problem . 
  what can those terrorists really do ? 
  kill a few people . 
  they can not destroy a whole country . 
  a government that systematically dismantles constitutional rights and checks most definitely can . 
  you have a much , much worse problem in the shape of nationalist fundamentalists . 
  germany played trendsetter for that already in 2000 , with an adorable little right wing nutjob party in hamburg : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_for_a_rule_of_law_offensive, 
  actually , a condom vending machone outside , exposed to heat and freezing temperatures is a great way to get condoms that break ... 
   speculation is minimal are you making a joke or talking about something you do not have the tiniest bit of knowledg of ? 
  see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bielefeld_conspiracy, 
  we like our french front porch . 
  you 're welcome to the beer , we love the d\u00f6ner !, 
  you mean the comment i was replying to , right ? 
  because mine is founded strictly on the german laws underlying this issue . 
  they are very specific , and yes , they also have a clause to cover holocaust denial , for historical reasons . 
  but stating that it 's about anything `` politically incorrect '' is just simply wrong ( and a strawman ) . 
   multiculturalism ( see the judge who said an indian father was okay to beat his child due to his origins ) brings another blow against english law . 
  you do n't have to be indian to legally beat your child in the uk : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporal_punishment_in_the_home#united_kingdom_2, 
  given the history of germany , yes . 
  free speech has limits , and has them everywhere including the usa . 
  in germany it has a few very specific additional limits due to history . 
  nope , the laws are quite clear and do not apply to that unless the criticism takes the form of incitement to violence or racial hatred . 
  besides , it is absolutely not true that the majority of the population is opposed . 
  only in the sense of `` politically incorrect = condoning mass murder and genocide '' . 
  you have no fucking idea what you 're talking about . 
  free speech is alive and healthy in germany . 
  `` persepolis '' has a hilarious scene where the iranian protagonist 's secular family is followed home by the `` morality police '' . 
  the father whispers to the mother `` i 'll delay them , you go up to the flat and get rid of the booze ! '' . 
  he comes in just as they 've finished pouring the last bottle down the sink and exclaims `` we got lucky , they just wanted a bribe ... 
  wait , you 've already dumped it all ?? 
  well , * shit * ! '', 
  that 's not how the `` rule of law '' thing works ... 
  the best possible proof that you 're making up shit out of thin air based on nothing but racism and xenophobia : some guy says his `` gut feelings '' tell him that `` as many as two percent '' could be , and you know for a fact that `` at least 1 in 50 '' is . 
  meanwhile the * fact * is that the actual proven cases can be counted on half the fingers of one hand . 
  closest thing i could find is this : http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/deutscher-aufschwung-am-arbeitsmarkt-geht-an-auslaendern-vorbei-a-921489.html 13.9 % unemployment among foreigners , 6.6 % among natives , as of 2012 . 
  who are you talking about ? 
  the people from the balkans ( who are largely not muslims ) or the syrians ( the majority of which are * not * analphabets ) ? 
   no , what i am saying is that the muslim religion is not compatible with the west . 
  full stop . 
  then you are shortsighted and wrong . 
  full stop . 
   we do n't want 7th century death cults in europe . 
  that is a gross and toxic misrepresentation that says more about you than about islam . 
  which is not to say that there are not deeply problematic attributes in islam as it is currently often practiced , but that is no different than christianity ( more so in the past , but in some instances still today ) . 
   either that religion gets reformed by themselves that is absolutely something that must happen . 
  and something that * is * happening - and should be supported rather than denigrated . 
   either they abandon it or they will have to leave . 
  you are aware that freedom of religion is one of those fundamental human rights `` the west '' considers itself superior for adhering to ? 
   they need to go through their reformation just like christianity did . 
  i think you have a very wrong idea about what the reformation in christianity was . 
  it had nothing to do with human rights or pacifism . 
  in fact , it led to * copious * amounts of fanaticism and religious wars . 
  the with hunts peaked right in the middle of reformation and ocurred in protestant areas as well as catholic ones . 
  i think it went hilariously right . 
  about as detached as the average trump fan ( not personally though , i suspect ) . 
  putin 's attempts to annex parts of the ukraine seems to be the closest fit . 
   `` patrolling '' is not clearly explained , but it seems to imply some sort of intimidation or subtle harrassment or stalking from what i heard , all they did was hand out pamphlets and politely remind people who looked muslim ( and yeah , there 's some fine irony there ) of what the koran says about alcohol . 
  so , about as much intimidation and harassment as the jehova 's witnesses , the wwf or the local paper peddling free trial subscriptions . 
   if london is anything like some major cities in germany ~ ~ or sweden ~ ~ , he 's ~ ~ right ~ ~ wrong . 
  ftfy, 
  i 'm not aware of anyone proposing to `` throw out all nazis , including those who 've never * done * anything '' . 
  that depends entirely on the specific actions . 
  it 's a proxy for ethnicity/race , because the people from the middle east are overwhelmingly muslims . 
  the racist mindset is `` group x is inferior and dangerous '' , and when race is not a socially acceptable way to identify group x , a strongly coinciding religion is a useful backup . 
  but a white convert to islam who practices his religion in private will not be insulted on the street and considered a probable rapist , while a brown person ( who may well be a christian ) will be . 
  so the solution to islamists possibly using salami tactics to subjugate moderate muslims living in europe is to throw out the moderate muslims ? 
  because that 's what you 're apparently saying if you disagree with my statement . 
  why are you so intolerant ? 
  which is exactly why we should not tolerate racists who want to throw out all muslims because of the behaviour of some of them . 
   germans spend an average of 18,17 years in education according to the oecd . 
  the only way that 's possible is if they count vocational training time ( azubi ) fully as `` in education '' , but two thirds of that is spent working regularly . 
  that they 're willing to be a producting member of society rather than life off charity ? 
  ok , you 've lost , how will you give it to me ? 
  translation `` in the current month more than half of the first applicants ( 28,214 first applicants , 53,5 % ) were registered from syria '' source : https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201510-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile, 
   because it 's not as if germany is already struggling with its 5 % muslim population ( oops , that should be 6.2 % now , right ? 
  and 7.4 % next year ? ), 
  as well as other immigrants , right ? 
  indeed we are doing reasonably well with those , and that without even having made an effort for the longest time . 
   may or may not have affiliations with the islamic state that they are fleeing is pretty much the best possible proof that they do n't have such affiliations . 
  wrong . 
  in those parts of the world , people * can * make a living for themselves and improve their lot . 
  if their conditions are particularly bad , they can at least move to other parts of their country . 
   children do n't go to school from 4 years on in germany ? 
  no , usually you start school at 6 . 
   realistic is the word you 're looking for nope , in fact your view is rather unrealistic . 
  motivation counts for a lot . 
   moreover , what 's way worse is that they did not come to germany for safety ( which is obvious , as they could have stopped anywhere between turkey and munchen ) , but for its ' wealth .
