that seems terribly inefficient . 
  there was an interesting article about that in / r/europe recently : [ linking to the thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wcios/no_right_turn_for_spanish_politics_why_spanish/de8zocy/?st=iztx61ij&amp;sh=4a9be7fb ) rather than the original article because of paywall c & p. 
  do they mean the actual mountains or the spirit i am guessing lives in there ? 
  i 'm asking because dofri crops up all over old norse literature so i know he exists as a personification of the mountain range . 
  i 'm just not sure how that is received in modern norwegian culture ... 
  it 's jingle jan b\u00f6hmermann ( the comedian who was sued by erdogan ) uses [ everytime he speaks about trump . 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bz8ap46ew-w ), 
  the most corrupt president the us has ever had both morally and literally . 
  alright , you heard them . 
  tear down the column !, 
  that was my first thought as well . 
  i guess in a similar vein one could add prague , salzburg and stra\u00dfburg . 
  i 'd say [ correctiv ] ( https://correctiv.org ) for germany . 
  they 're an independent investigative journalism outfit . 
  i believe that do accept donations from anyone , though , do no idea whether that falls under your no corporate sponsors rule ... 
  interestingly enough all evidence [ seems to point towards it being real ] ( https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/this-edl-member-repeatedly-failing-to-set-fire-to-a-european-flag-can-teach-us-a-lot-about-ourselves-909 ) . 
   i can vouch for this , despite having the largest diaspora of any single country ( germany is second iirc ) they are n't really seen as a diaspora . 
  interestingly enough it 's the exact same for germans . 
  tbf , almost all of the dresses linked in this thread received their final form in the 19th century . 
  there 's almost nothing `` authentically european '' that was n't invented in its current form in the 19th century , from kilts to ( non-ruined ) medieval castles to alemannischen fastnacht . 
  we have that in germany : kaffeklatsch, 
  i think your judgment might have been clouded a bit by having to concentrate extra on driving on the other side of the road . 
  personally i find the uk system needlessly complicated and the german system a lot better . 
  not saying that it is , just that for me , too , familiarity clouds judgement . 
  so your `` question '' is really just an opportunity to preach at us * ex cathedra * ? 
  i am honestly kinda shocked that there are apparently at least some americans that think that . 
  that the reason american troops are in , say , germany is because otherwise we would attack poland again . 
  not for example because rammstein afb is a major support hub for the afghanistan and iraq wars or africom in stuttgart is the coordination centre for drone attacks in africa but because europeans ca n't be trusted with their own nations . 
   for that matter the german word for someone from the us is amerikanisch , no ? 
  on the news they would actually say us-amerikanisch . 
  amerikanisch is a colloquialism . 
  about 70 % of the people i regularly text live in a different country . 
  even if i had free texts i doubt that would apply to international texts . 
  i presume those europeans that ask you about whatsapp in the us will also leave again at some point and will still want to be able to contact you for free ? 
   but with a federalized eu they would disappear . 
  why ? 
  we do n't need holocaust deniers here . 
  it does seem a bit like one of those artificial constructs colonial powers imposed on africa and the middle east , does n't it ? 
  no respect for tribal areas . 
  i do n't know whether you read the same ama i read but yeah , it 's chilling . 
  not under sigmar `` i try to legalise supermarket mergers although my ministry has decided against it '' gabriel . 
  not under siggi `` climate change goals do n't really belong into a climate change proposal '' gabriel . 
  oh come on !, 
  nobody uses it in the sense you mean . 
  tbf people do n't read the afd 's election manifesto , though . 
  there will be at least one person who votes afd in the next election because they see this article and see that once again the government is doing what nobody in the population wants . 
  meanwhile ( as i said in another comment ) afd would probably privatise the highways and sell the railways to a russian state company . 
  social democratic , not socialist . 
  maybe not in american english but in [ uk usage it is n't ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_the_united_kingdom ) . 
  not at the age most the_donald users are since they simply have n't had time yet to learn more than one or two in school . 
  i only spoke english and rudimentary french when i was 14 . 
   mainly weird because the uk is n't as war-mongering as you seem to think . 
  huh , i must have imagined the chilcot report . 
  14-year old meme kids on the_donald are . 
  / r/the _ donald are n't `` the working man '' . 
  far from it . 
  your flag game is n't exactly on point is it ? 
  that 's a stupid romanticised view , though . 
  this is n't the 40s anymore . 
  i 'm pretty sure the person agreeing with @fascistcow would n't see a comparison with the npd as a negative ... 
  [ and this will be our navy . 
  ] ( http://cinapse.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/petticoat5.png ), 
  i 'm not going to rise to this bait . 
  i 'm sorry you feel that way but i wo n't be able to convince you of the opposite anyway . 
  have a nice day . 
  oh my sweet summer child . 
  you know nothing about modern germany . 
  nothing . 
  luckily almost all of them are monolingual idiots . 
  i hope so at least . 
  why would you say that ? 
  are you implying germany will dominate this alliance ? 
  are you implying there will be genocide ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
  the german electorate would definitely be more happy to pay into an eu army rather than a domestic one . 
  germany was always going to be sacrificed as the battleground . 
  the whole fulda gap strategy hinged on that . 
  where i live they 've only recently filled in the shafts for the atomic mines that would blow up strategic valley roads in the face of an advancing soviet army . 
  this was all common knowledge back then . 
  there is a lot you could level at the eu . 
  but spinelessness in the face of opposition to their values is not among that . 
  oh putin will definitely stress test a trump administration in the first few days in office . 
  just to see what happens . 
   do you think winning the election somehow makes him a dictator no  and he wo n't listen to any of his staff ? 
  yes, 
  actually , the 2 % are only advisory . 
  just like a certain referendum ... 
   were you not around the last time the republicans held both wings of congress and the presidency ... ? 
  tbf they probably were n't . 
  or at least not politically concious . 
  so is yours . 
  i 've always loved the colour scheme on that . 
  yes but it also keeps them from being represented in parliament at all which builds up the pressure that was then released in a vote on an unconnected entity because that vote happened to not be fptp . 
  while it 's true that it was populism i feel the need to point out that german public opinion was against nuclear energy ever since the eighties and the nuclear phaseout was already well on its way when fukushima happened . 
  the only difference was that merkel realised she could make a quick political buck off the situation and eased off the brakes she had put on a process that was already underway and massively popular before . 
  these are actual human lives and livelihoods you 're talking about here , not some numbers in a war game where you look at spreadsheets and maps of eastern europe and decide it 's not worth the money to protect them . 
   pink elephant army we 'll have such cool logos on our airplanes and tanks . 
   also america just elected a president of german descent . 
  hey , do n't pin this on us . 
  because of institutional inertia .
