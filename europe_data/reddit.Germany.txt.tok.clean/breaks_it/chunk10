  though the more likely outcome is a system akin to other european countries where a private system is intertwined with a publicivate one and everyone is required by law to purchase health insurance . 
  i mean jeremy hunt wrote a book on how a private system is better in his opinion . 
  what do you think this is the precursor of ? 
  it 's the old strategy of privatise a bit , wait till service is shit , say `` see it does n't work , we need to privatise '' , privatise , profit ( for your mates ) . 
  [ yeah , about that ... ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-health-service-healthcare-privatisation-a7160771.html ), 
  no but they have massive problems with social cohesion and unbridled capitalism . 
  you 're saying that as if the only benefit you get from the eu as a country is the money they distribute through various schemes . 
  however that 's not the case as being in the single market alone brings the uk much more money than anything they pay . 
  ( i 've read estimates from something like 20 # in business that they gain for any 1 # they spend on the eu . ), 
  it 's like paying for a premium location on the high street if you have a retail shop . 
  yes , you pay high rents but the amount of business results in more earnings than in another location where you pay less rent . 
  yet national governments in those countries refused to accept the loan of customs officers from other countries and frontex is toothless because nobody wants an eu agency patrol their national borders . 
  this is very much a member state problem . 
  i hope that means it stays on their permanent record , right ? 
  they 're vorbestraft ? 
  well i hope they learned it . 
  because without it what are we ? 
  look at china , where cultural heritage is either being destroyed or disneyfied into superficial tourist attractions . 
  when cultural heritage becomes a commodity society loses its moorings . 
  dogs will wait until they 're almost starved to death , though . 
  i bet it does !, 
   express their unique identity every second one is roses or poppies ... 
  yup , checks out . 
  actually all beaches were nude beaches . 
  you noob . 
  come off it , yeah it 's infantile but it 's not like the rest of reddit does n't run memes into the ground . 
  i do n't see it as failed . 
  our turkish and italian citizens are much better integrated than maghrebis in france or indians and pakistanis in the uk ( in general . 
  obviously many are integrated there as well and some are not here ), 
  guest workers were never supposed to be deported , thiugh . 
  it was naively expected that many of them would leave but it was never the law that they had to . 
  refugees and asylum rejects have to . 
  because we 've deported refugees with families before , after the end of the yugoslavian civil war . 
  not an affiliation , just that you read it . 
  and it 's not paranoia , i just find it fascinating how these things spread in this age of new populism . 
  if you have an overactive imagination , maybe . 
  it 's rather cloudy at the moment . 
  if it were a proper summer at least !, 
  and you know exactly what i was saying : it 's easy to criticise the actions of others from far away , be that the faroes or cambodia . 
  while i live close to ansbach and i have a detailed understanding of german politics from having lived here for almost 30 years . 
  inventing a catchphrase like that is insulting , to be honest . 
  meh , a faroese person not mentioning sheep once in their comment . 
  how extraordinary . 
  are we really going to resort to lazy stereotypes ? 
  btw , your `` dunno '' was n't humour . 
  it was an attempt at deflection . 
  on another note : am i the only one who thinks that based on the pictures their breaching attempt was a bit of a shambles ? 
  looks like they could n't even break the lock with that improvised battering ram . 
  you were a leadsome supporter , were n't you ? 
  `` if '' being the operative word here . 
  you do n't know but you have a nuanced understanding of german security policy ? 
  might be . 
  i 'm not 100 % certain the others are gsg 9 either , but i remember it being reported as such at the time ( including a very similar picture in my local newspaper that identified them as such ) ... 
  but then havng been at the receiving end of `` professionalism '' and `` accuracy '' in newspaper journalism i 'm not sure anyway . 
  they were operating in munich and caught on film , though . 
  but not `` in charge '' of course . 
  you could also see an [ interesting difference to local sek ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/video_previews/n/p/npctb3nde6vsqy1x0afmkvfv6dahvwx-medium.jpg ), 
  how many attacks were there in the faroes again ? 
  little englanders , please . 
  scots and the norn irish were prudent . 
  yup , this image problem is in large part what let to brexit . 
  national politicians and companies claiming the good stuff for themselves and blaming the eu for all the bad stuff . 
  unfortunately if the eu started an image campaign now all the eurosceptics would scream `` propaganda !, 
  and soon the uk ( if they do n't go the eea route , which is increasingly unlikely ) . 
   ( or dubbed if you 're french ) or german :(, 
  [ a lot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/november_9_in_german_history ) . 
  it 's also called germany 's fateful day . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uzgql/chinese_tourists_shun_western_europe_in_wake_of/d5u76u7?st=ir6b4hcj&amp;sh=c162e74f ), 
  i 'm here to point out your adherence to a pattern others have [ noticed as well ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4ux7lw/some_brexitwashing_examples_from_the_daily_express/d5u68oq?st=ir6arhwm&amp;sh=843dea20 ) . 
  i 'm asking because your pattern of writing matches the express exactly . 
  including the capitalised boom and random capitalisation in general . 
  are you a reader of the daily express by any chance ? 
  wow . 
  if that is true that 's indeed catastrophic . 
  all of the may be correct ( except maybe the hypothesis of islamist double agents in french intelligence ) but what i was saying , and what you have not touched upon , is that if / u/spin0 insists that you are not a right-wing extremist of you were n't involved in an official organisation before than i would argue that by the same token the ansbach attacker was not is . 
  it 's not so much a comment on is tactics and more on double standards in media/this sub . 
  we could just set the threshold to six degrees of separation and arrest everyone !, 
  way ahead of you . 
  it 's called / r/worldnews . 
  each one of those will only make the eu desire a strong response to britain to keep itself together . 
  and can we please stay with the facts ? 
  mass sexual-assault . 
  if you wait till next august next year you 'll anatagonise the eu to such a degree that there will not be any goodwill left . 
  then most recent attacks were n't committed by is either . 
  one specific instance that was n't even a terror attack but a crime of passion . 
  not if they started claiming it , though . 
  nationalism is some kind of reverse self-fulfilling prophecy ... 
  not germany . 
  hamburg is pretty cosmopolitan , but so are other cities . 
  and the rural areas are the same coast or no coast . 
  because that money flows back into the ni economy . 
  and when the eu offers hbo 20 cents in grants for every dollar they spend in ni it 's a win-win for both . 
  all the locations in lotr are miniatures or landscape shots , so yeah , i could imagine it . 
  and parts of got are shot in iceland and northern africa . 
  somehow they manage to communicate with the natives . 
  you really overestimate the language barrier . 
  the bbc produce a lot of their series in the czech republic . 
  stuff like the musketeers . 
  most of the sound stages for the hunger games : mockingjay were in germany . 
  most extras do n't have speaking roles anyway ( for financial reasons ) so what you 're saying goes both against logic and current practice .
