  i get irrationally angry sometimes when people from the anglosphere ca n't even imagine that stuff could n't possibly get done if not everyone involved is a native speaker . 
  well if you 're lucky you might still have freedom of movement when you finish your bachelors . 
  then you can decide whether you 'll do your ma on the continent and be grandfathered in . 
  complete an ma degree and do your doctorate with us ? 
   more difficult doing this stuff in the eu as they do n't always speak english bullshit . 
  do you really believe movie companies around europe do n't employ english-speaking staff ? 
  how has prague become the go to location for hollywood `` old world '' scenes then ? 
  or the czech republic in general for tv productions ? 
  or studio babelsberg for hollywood ? 
   we 're not leaving europe we 're leaving the eu apples and oranges but get impression some think this was a direct fuck you to anyone who lives in europe . 
  it kinda was . 
  maybe not from you but from many of your fellow leave voters . 
  i have told so many brexiters just that . 
  it was genuinely shocking how many people who decided on this did n't know the difference between schengen , freedom of movement and visa waiver programmes . 
  how can you make an informed decision on immigration if you do n't even know the very basics ? 
   the uk leaving the eu would make no difference to the legal obligations of france to uphold the international law of asylum , it 's the bilateral le touquet agreement that 's responsible for the calais situation , not asylum law . 
  the french are n't obligated to have the british border on their side of the channel . 
  ironically your username is the only entirely correct thing you posted in this thread . 
  it is indeed the uk media 's fault . 
   germany , bavaria hah hah hah hah hah !, 
  the bavarian independence movement is almost exclusively satirical my friend . 
  it 's not a real thing for more than maybe .01 % of the bavarian population . 
  well yeah , obviously . 
  did i say anywhere that you have to be pro-refugee to be left ? 
  single issues do n't position anyone on the political spectrum . 
  well for one parts of the cdu are . 
  you are n't seriously saying someone on the political right ca n't support refugees ? 
  that would be very unfair to the right . 
  never left , though . 
   remainers now need to embrace brexit no , they need to accept it and work to mitigate its effects , they do n't need to embrace it . 
  you would n't have embraced a remain vote either . 
   if the european project was succeeding , people surely would n't want this deal because they would be happy with the status quo , right ? 
  if not , which is clearly the case , it 's not a zero sum game , though . 
  yes , individual nations would profit ( in a scenario where the uk has profited before ) but many would n't when the eu collapses as a result . 
  hence the eu countries as a whole are better off if nobody leaves . 
  and unlike the uk ( and please do n't take that as an insult ) many voters in continental countries would actually like to see their neighbours succeed . 
  or in other words : while individual countries might benefit from leaving the eu others would be severely damaged by its dissolution . 
  and the eu is supposed to be beneficial to all of us . 
  oh , i believe if you only watch fox news or read the sun you actually can change your ideology and worldview accordingly regardless of your original intentions . 
  i agree that there are underlying issues that should not have been left to the tabloids as the only ones addressing them but that does n't change the fact that they are responsible for this . 
  i ca n't think of a single left-wing tabloid , though ( remember newspaper = / = tabloid ) . 
  of course there are blogs espousing any kind of loony and extremist ideology and packaging it as news . 
  but widely available commercial products ? 
  take that you miserly old crones , mildred and patty hill !, 
  i see no contradiction there . 
  but should n't they be able to take these factors into account ? 
  i 'm certainly no expert but i guess you would invest in something that benefits from a sudden drop of the pound ? 
  yeah , i do n't understand how financial analysts of all people can be so blind to this . 
  this thing is on rails now , article 50 will be triggered at some point as much as i 'd like it not to . 
  you should totally go to that butcher 's and ask for one square-shaftment of bacon and half a gunter 's chain of sausage links . 
  the bavarian with swiss flair ? 
  i wonder whether that would also be the case if copenhagen were on jylland ... 
  freiburg also has [ this ] ( http://tram-bilder.de/resources/fr121-2010-08-27-2-g$c3$bcnterstahlstra$c3$9fe.jpg ) . 
  a tram with a bar that you can rent for rolling private parties with a view . 
   piigs . 
   why are you getting pissy ? 
  seriously ? 
  i like your point about the flags . 
  it 's something i have remarked upon before as well . 
  it 's clear that you have lived on the continent because that is something even most remainers can not wrap their heads around : that we actually do identify with the eu , that we do see ourselves as european citizens . 
  and that this does n't diminish our national self-image at all . 
  that it 's a complementary identity . 
  i used to walk daily past a building that housed both the german and the uk embassy in that country and it struck me every time that the german embassy had two flag pole while the british one had only one . 
  lexit is the left argument for brexit , is n't it ? 
  how about metropoleave ? 
  but what about my red pill !! 1 !, 
   just because no , you 're insane because you do n't consider this a big deal apparently . 
  i genuinely do n't understand how you 're struggling with this and i 'm not being smug . 
  seriously , show me where on [ this ] ( http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/56a77a8f58c32386008b5205-909-695/screen%20shot%202016-01-26%20at%2013.48.09.png ) it mentions freedom of movement or the word `` hard brexit '' !, 
  it was n't on the ballot paper . 
  that 's a demonstrable fact . 
  how can you argue otherwise ? 
  you could have left the eu and stayed in the eea though . 
  that 's brexit . 
  hard brexit was n't on there . 
  add br alpha and zdfneo to that ( and no , i wo n't call it ard alpha , it 's a shame it was taken away from the br ) . 
   vileness is ... kinda inherently german , it seems . 
  nice try but i 'm not that easily baited . 
  yes ? 
  well the us first ( see my original post ) but the second one would not be the uk . 
  you realise that we 're talking about what the world thinks are shining lights of democracy , not whatever the reality might be , right ? 
  yeah , the eu wo n't go for that . 
  and rightly so . 
  but we 're talking about following the rules here , not what the electorate would accept . 
  and it would be totally legal to go for an eea relationship even if one somehow accepted the referendum as legally binding ( which it is n't ) . 
   france ? 
  why ? 
  french revolution and all that . 
   plenty do and rightly so . 
  give me some examples then . 
   you ca n't just move here and get money . 
  but if you can that 's ** entirely ** the uk government 's fault , not the eu 's . 
  but i was talking about what the op of this sub-thread [ was talking about !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62ke7t/eu_tells_uk_we_will_not_punish_you_brexit_is/dfnf76p/ ), 
  the only thing that comes close to that is renegotiating the fact that child benefits for migrants could be paid at the rates of the country the child resides in rather than british rates . 
  but that 's a minor thing . 
  what i was talking about above is the fact that ( like germany and many other eu countries ) at any point the uk could have decided to deport eu migrants if they have n't held a job for three months . 
  that has always been perfectly legal for any eu country , since it 's freedom of movement of ** workers ** that the eu provides . 
  waht exactly are you talking about here ? 
  but that 's he thing : these are n't concessions from the eu : the uk has always had the right to do that .
