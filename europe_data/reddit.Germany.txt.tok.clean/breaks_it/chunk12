  without any renogotiation or anything . 
  maybe i misunderstood your point but i have read a lot of arguments from brexters that said `` the uk is a beacon of democracy . 
  when people around the world think democracy they think of us first . 
  we 're the oldest democracy in the world . '', 
  ( as if the magna carta was n't simply a way for aristocrats to control the kingship but rather some magic document of equality for all ) . 
  and that 's just not true . 
  mate , nobody thinks of the uk as a shining example of democracy . 
  that 's something only brits think is a thing . 
  when you say democracy people think of france or even the us first . 
   benefits are ** statutory rights in the uk ** . 
  you 're entitled to them if you live under the jurisdiction . 
  as i recall , we managed either in cameron 's negotiations or something slightly before that , ** we got concessions from the eu ** that we were allowed to restrict that to uk citizens only , do you not see the contradiction there ? 
  as you said it 's a uk decision to give benefits to everyone , the eu has no influence over this . 
  the uk government could have at any point stopped providing benefits to immigrants who are out of work and even deported them ** without breaching eu regulations ** . 
  however they did n't for several reasons : - the number of `` benefit scroungers '' among eu migrants is vanishingly small . 
  - the current levels of immigration are good for the uk economy and the government knew that but would n't admit it publicly . 
  - an effective policy would need a registration scheme for all residents so it could be tracked who 's in the country and for how long . 
  however the uk public is deathly afraid of address registration and id cards for some reason . 
  ( while at the same time being ok with the much more intrusive cctv and snoopers charter ) . 
  i do n't think most brits realise how far-reaching and hard-won cameron 's renegotiation was and that he was stabbed in the back by the british press and their dodgy deal myth . 
  that would be a preferred outcome for the eu but one that ca n't be sold to the uk electorate . 
  i 'm sure that had nothing to do with having vast amounts of natural resources and being very close to asia . 
  nothing at all . 
  a higher standard than greece ? 
  the inventors of the concept ? 
  o. . k. . . 
   hell , greek crisis-level thinking . 
  that was n't punitive . 
  why would you derail a valid point like that ? 
  norway also has free movement , the absolute anathema for any brexiter . 
  how is that surprising ? 
  i do n't recall hard brexit being on there either . 
  the antonine wall is closer to the scottish border , though ... 
  you said `` not a whole lot of people '' , not `` not a whole lot of americans '' , did n't you ? 
  which is exactly why i am so passionately against brexit . 
  tja so it das . 
  i do n't disrespect or hate her either . 
  but i also would n't call her likeable . 
  she 's certainly become a bit more suave and states ( wo ) manlike in the last few years but she has never had charisma . 
  which is a big part of why she was elected in the first place imo . 
  we were tired of schr\u00f6der 's grandstanding . 
  maybe it has to do with having grown up before she became chancellor but i really do n't see her as likeable . 
   merkel is very likeable she is ? 
  what ? 
  it 's literally the most iconic classic aircraft in germany . 
  i 'd even say it 's the only ww2 airplane most germans would be able to identify correctly . 
  ( and yes i 'm including planes like the bf 109 in that and all allied planes ), 
  angie herself is n't exactly charismatic . 
  nor was any president since weizs\u00e4cker . 
  depends on how he eats a bacon sandwich ... 
  yeah , but they could still join the celtic union ( and the eu with it ) . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  he expected remain to win comfortably , to crush ukip and to cement his legacy as the great unifier in two referenda . 
  obviously cameron took a gamble and lost , ending his career . 
  but the vultures who took over are taking another gamble and it looks like they 're going to get away with it , too . 
  but ignoring the non-binding referendum would be entirely within the bounds of democracy !, 
  what about the isle of man ? 
  the rules were about a non-binding referendum and a noreay-type eea solution is within the rules even if you accept the result . 
  do n't kid yourself that this is about anything else but keeping the tories in power . 
  but should n't a politician put their country over their career ? 
  is n't that the whole idea of government ? 
  to have representatives that do what 's best for the country to the best of their abilities ? 
  you should really add new south wales to that . 
  just for consistency 's sake ... 
  touch\u00e9 !, 
  ah , the famous but islam is not a race !!! 11 !, 
  defense . 
  it 's not , yet somehow you 're still a racist . 
  yeah but that 's a stupid turn of phrase . 
  especially since it 's the brexiters that always repeat that `` they 're leaving the eu and not europe '' . 
  the problem is that all his interviews are in french and german and the anglosphere ca n't stand that . 
  so they make a cartoon villain out of him from snippets of translations . 
  like in this case where an obviously humourous simile makes him a scheming secessionist . 
  or beowulf . 
  the problem is that they 're foreigners that have sovereignty , you see ? 
   but on the other hand , juncker is a anti-american bitch who 's wanted to trade our alliance in for stronger ties with russia what ? 
  juncker is n't really known as a pro-russian . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  since trotz means `` spite '' it would be the spite-dems . 
  so yeah , checks out ... 
  as an archaeologist i ca n't stand that show . 
   10 times more quality tv than the whole of europe combined that 's mathematically impossible since the uk is part of europe . 
  because a ) it 's necessary for a truly free market and b ) it 's fucking amazing and it 's not in the spirit of europe if there 's a list of exceptions to personal freedoms . 
  it 's a bit different with more intergovernmental stuff like the cap or the euro where exceptions for countries make sense . 
  but when it comes to personal freedoms there must absolutely not be any difference between individual eu citizens no matter where they come from . 
  that 's why we have the visa spat with the us at the moment . 
  anything else would go against the spirit of the eu . 
  at least for know . 
  who knows what 's going to happen with the two-speed thing ... 
  well the `` taxes '' in this analogy was n't just monetary contributions but all obligations , like free movement . 
  ( though why the uk public sees free movement as an obligation and not a privilege i 'll never understand . 
  it 's one of my favourite things about the eu , and my country gets more immigrants than the uk ), 
  there 's no such thing as comedy articles . 
  this was shaping the narrative about the eu . 
  it 's those communist genes !, 
  you should see denmark . 
  they 're flag crazy . 
  and around here people often fly their regional flag ( bavaria and/or franconia ) when they have a celebration with lots of attendants . 
  not as much as may but yeah i 'm sure future history books will have a picture like this as [ a staple ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/03c7/production/_90376900_cam_may.jpg ) when talking about the alt-right crisis of the mid-tens . 
  i think maybe the best way to explain it is that the eu makes us feel about other eu countries the same way that americans feel about canada ?
