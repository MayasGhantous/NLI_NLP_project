  but again : it 's not about the individual and it 's not about whether they even know that the empire existed . 
  it 's about ** how history has shaped the society and values of post-war britain ** . 
  even someone who has somehow never gone to school and has never heard about the empire will have grown up in a society that is profoundly shaped by its own history ** like literally any society on earth is ** . 
   i assume that you 're inferring that only people who voted leave have imperial nostalgia , but there 's no way of knowing that . 
  actually i 'm not . 
  i mentioned the thread in/r/uk above ( which definitely is n't a hotbed of leave voters ) and how even there people were unwilling to acknowledge that there was any influence of this history in their modern thinking . 
  maybe it 's because i 'm german but that thought is utterly alien to me . 
  of course your country 's history shapes your society and its values . 
  not you , your society as a whole . 
  i think you 'll agree that german society has deep wounds from nazism yet i as an individual citizen do n't need therapy . 
  which makes it all the more impressive that he later became pope himself . 
  well you 're wrong there . 
  but as i said above , you 're just not able to see what literally anyone on the outside sees clear as day . 
  not having dealt with the trauma of losing the status as a superpower basically overnight . 
  there is this weird attitude many english people have on the international stage of expecting everything to go their way and compromise being something for other countries ( of course what adds to that is the antagonistic political and judicial systems of fptp and common law respectively ) . 
  this is the attitude of a superpower , not of a medium sized country on the level of germany or france . 
  i find [ this article ] ( http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/the_problem_with_the_english_england_doesn_t_want_to_be_just_another_member_of_a_team_1_4851882 ) explains it well but i already know that you are going to dismiss it . 
  the thing is that it 's very hard to get this point across to someone who grew up in that bubble . 
  even the recent thread on the article in / r/uk was mostly staunch remainers refusing to acknowledge the deeper truth in it . 
  it only seems that way because everybody who 's not english realises that there is a deep psychological wound there that english society has n't dealt with . 
  and as long as it has n't the superiority complex will remain . 
  ( and i say english because the scots for example can see it very well ), 
  yeah but paul nuttall founded california in the first place . 
  so is he going to take the credit for the san andreas rift ? 
  easy . 
  efta membership , stay in the single market , tell trump to fuck off . 
  yes , and ? 
  the most this would prove is equal economic competence , not higher ? 
  yeah you 're right . 
  uhm , you realise our current economic stability is based on schr\u00f6der 's reforms ? 
  regardless of what you think of those saying the cdu is more economically competent and less nanny-state oriented is just foolish . 
  you 're the elephant in the room . 
  the elephant that shot itself in the head for no reason . 
  would be weird to ignore the rotting carcass in the middle of our living room . 
  is n't that an equivalent of the mail , not an opposite ? 
  i know by it 's so unsatisfying to always be the grown-up . 
  i 'd like him to comprehend what damage he does and how the world sees him . 
  is cultural jihad you people 's new cultural marxism ? 
  some pretty bitchin ' castles, 
  what ? 
  14 is under 30 and graduate school is just a misspelling of grade school !, 
   i am no trump supporter per say , then why do you spell like one ? 
  a one-week no flight zone around rammstein . 
  and a two-week one after the inevitable next gaffe . 
  he 's a child , it 's time we used preschool pedagogy on him . 
   all he 'll just send billions of invoices then !, 
  made germany pay for it !, 
  no , there are jokers to the right !, 
   the uk wanted control over its borders , the eu refused and now the uk is leaving . 
  it seems to me like the eu scrrewed you guys over . 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  but that is completely self-inflicted . 
  they could say tomorrow , yeah that trump guy ... i do n't know ... you know what , let 's put a pin in that brexit business ... 
  but if it 's a racist disease then surely it should be fought even harder ? 
  [ here she is ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/statue_of_europa_%28vienna%29.jpg ) . 
  he 'll slow it down . 
  merkel 's will have a hard time not looking like the lapdog of an imbecile next time the budget is up for debate.she might have to stop the raise so she does n't look like she is kowtowing to a person literally 90 % of germans despise . 
  what a fucking circus clown . 
  eat it slowly while never breaking eye contact . 
  but germany does n't respect trump . 
  indeed . 
  it has to . 
  but it has just become so much harder to sell it to the electorate thanks to the real estate salesman and part-time president . 
  and it 's been rising yearly for a few years now . 
  it 's almost as if op is either ignorant or lying ... 
  we just do n't want to and the orange utan is n't helping . 
  and we already pledged to meet the 2 % by 2024 anyway ... under obama . 
  the thing is : the tories want an excuse to privatise healthcare . 
  they 're chomping at the bit . 
  it.doesn ` t.matter !, 
  as they said , the man does n't deserve 5 % of the vote . 
  if gw bush had been the other choice again he should have won . 
  literally anyone who has ever been in politics in the us would have been better than trump . 
  an hillary would have been basically obama without the charisma . 
  so still pretty good . 
  charlemagne would have worked . 
  though i still do n't understand why an american flag would be the example . 
  surely the german equivalent to the italians ' eu flag would be ... an eu flag ? 
  that 's like saying mps should n't give interviews about their positions because the competence to decide on them lies with the parliament as a whole . 
  who is kleistnes ? 
  wednesday in two years you mean . 
  afaik this one was commissioned by mussolini so it 's still a historical artifact that should n't be messed with too much but i do n't think placing a flag on it should hurt a massive bronze statue . 
  if the much older duke of wellington in your very own glasgow survives his daily climbing and traffic cone this one should be fine , too . 
  why ? 
  it 's a bronze copy of the augustus of prima porta . 
  the original is in the vatican museums and made from marble . 
  `` our own rules '' not `` your '', 
   in keinem anderen land war die einf\u00fchrung der neuen w\u00e4hrung so umstritten wie in der bundesrepublik of course there was a vote in parliament . 
  9 years after the general question of whether to go ahead with the euro was decided on an eec level . 
  my point is that the euro was not a german idea to dominate and enslave the rest of the continent economically . 
  because what is the narrative that the europhobes push . 
  what fucking vote ? 
  [ unless you were a member of the ausw\u00e4rtiges amt in 1989 you ca n't really remember the relevant events ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-73989788.html ) . 
  germany did n't want the euro . 
  why is it always us you europhobes hate ? 
  twice ? 
  literally hundreds !, 
  we 're gon na have to pay the toll as well you fool . 
  you do n't really believe the tax rebate is legal , do you ? 
  it 's a bait and switch .
