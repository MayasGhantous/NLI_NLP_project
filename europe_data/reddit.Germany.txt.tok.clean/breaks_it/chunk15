  plus we have also benefitted massively from `` paying for years '' for the eu . 
  `` ableist '' is the correct insult i believe . 
  why ? 
  still , if you say ( in english ) `` the bundestag is the german senate '' eight out of ten people will think of the us , one of rome and maybe one of france . 
  i 'm sure it 's different if you say it in french or italian but the conversation we 're having was started in english . 
  yeah maybe i should have said people will think of america when they hear senate but in the end that 's all the same , really . 
  the fact that one head was amputated does n't mean it was n't born with two !, 
  and senate is american . 
  i find upper house more descriptive personally . 
  it 's not like we call it the house of lords . 
  the bundesrat . 
  i see nothing wrong with that translation ? 
  do they get media attention ? 
  i was speaking from personal experience . 
  having lived in freiburg you ca n't help but become aware of them . 
  the only media stories about them i have ever seen is the one that was on / r/de a few weeks ago ... 
  i think if you ask people on the street how they see the eu they 'll either say it 's a roughly equal union or an expanded franco-german alliance ( or of course an unelected buerocracy , we have the contingent of crazy europhobes as well , albeit in much smaller numbers than others ) . 
  but no-one on either side of the political spectrum is going to say it 's a method for us bullying other nations . 
  edit : well come think it maybe the anti-german extreme left would . 
  and yes , we have a political movement that thinks germans are inherently evil and the country should have been broken up after the war . 
  so when i say anti-german it 's not a slur like `` unamerican '' . 
  they call themselves that . 
  yeah but the comic makes it look like germans want to be the leaders of the eu or see themselves as that which is decidedly not true either for our government nor the people on the streets . 
  the day the bbc and the nhs are gone britain has lost its post-war soul . 
  analogies , what are they ? 
  i 'm getting tired of the whole eu as german crypto-union thing . 
  maybe an argument could be made that others see germany like that but it 's definitely not true that germany sees the eu like that . 
  i would love some art nouveau government logos , though . 
  i 'm sure that 's more of an example of your inner german showing ? 
  good thing they 're all using the flag colours then . 
  it 's a freak of nature . 
  or , on a more low-brow level the famous [ `` hol mir mal ne flasche bier '' ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1fg-j1ngric ), 
  are you saying reichsb\u00fcrger logic is less than consistent ? 
  say it ai n't so !, 
  it 's not the decision * per se * that makes them stupid but the way they arrived at it . 
   later on it was said that remain were spending too much time debunking lies , which ignorant did n't listen . 
  it was more important to connect with them on `` emotional level '' , apparently ... 
  it 's a sad state of affairs but it 's true . 
  as do we , although we had no chance to influence the shit show that was the referendum buildup . 
  when are your next general elections and how likely is it that a saner party will be in power afterwards ? 
  not after the vote afaik . 
  oh yeah , that 's a big one . 
  and so baffling . 
  context . 
  it 's not just the actual document you have to consider but also facts like [ trump literally asking how to make a muslim ban not sound like one ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/trump-asked-for-a-muslim-ban-giuliani-says-and-ordered-a-commission-to-do-it-legally/ ) . 
   for that matter , though , has trump been out of the us at all since november ? 
  i do n't think so , actually . 
  waffles and beer . 
  what more do you want ? 
  you call someone trying to exclude the members of one religion from his country a civic nationalist and not an ethnic one ? 
  that is either intellectually dishonest or simply deluded . 
  and yeah `` islam is not a race !!! 11 ! '' . 
  it 's still racism , mate . 
  i 'd not feel guilty in the least . 
   who see all of international politics as a zero sum game i 'd even say they see everything as a zero sum game . 
  healthcare , jobs , welfare ... 
  if someone gets something for free that must mean i get less . 
  that 's their thinking . 
  the rhetoric around the referendum is the same as that used by trump supporters and far-right parties around europe . 
  trump and leave used the same resources , such as cambridge analytica . 
  it 's a stated goal of both trump and some of his appointees to destroy the eu . 
  trump literally [ called himself mr. brexit ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/18/politics/donald-trump-mr-brexit-2016-election/ ) . 
  and then there 's [ this ] ( http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5827ac1d1800002a0030daaf.jpeg ) . 
  well they literally said they wanted just that , so yeah it is . 
  throw in david davis and we can talk . 
  of course it is . 
  it 's very [ much ] ( http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/churchill-war-rooms ) a [ thing ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/11/best-film-set-ever-designed-dr-strangelove-s-war-room ) . 
  that said it 's the telegraph that calls it a war room in this case , not the eu . 
  i think they heard about brexit and ( rightly ) thought of it as part of the alt-right surge so they feel they have to be against the eu as well . 
  so many town walls razed by swedish troops . 
  that impacts our tourism , you know ? 
  still , we do n't know whether bletchley park would have even attempted to break it if they did n't know it was possible . 
  iirc they were n't exactly well funded in the beginning and might well have turned their attention elsewhere . 
  do you not know what the word `` arguably '' means ? 
  yeah but i 'm saying we 'll never know whether turing would have been able to do that if the poles had n't found that first chink in the armour . 
  why ? 
  you do n't need a guide to that . 
  just repeat after me : `` you 're european '' . 
  arguably enigma would not have been broken without the polish . 
  who knows what that would have meant . 
  but we 'll never know . 
  it 's fucking belgium . 
  they live and breathe bds . 
  but of course you would n't have any idea about the cultures of the rest of europe . 
  i do n't have an answer for the rest of that ridiculous comment since i do n't think even you believe what you 're saying there . 
  i 'm sure there 's a document which lists it all that the uk is going to receive after the triggering . 
   so it 's kind of confusing what we 're even meant to be paying this # 50bn because you owe them ? 
  we 're not going to pay for british civil servants ' pensions . 
  that would be preposterous . 
  my point was more that he is trump 's brain parasite ... 
   although i 'm in no position to judge , voting to leave does n't mean they do n't love you . 
  maybe not in isolation . 
  but in the context of the leave campaign , the tabloids and the post-referendum government rethoric it means exactly that . 
  you have an opinion about an institution about which you do n't even know the very basics ? 
   wilders , johnson and karashit had those too , you know ? 
  they also have a case of the bannons ? 
  then he 'll run as an independent and would be the first one ever to have a chance , too . 
  providing he 's not impeached soon of course . 
   m no expert but i cant vote for anyone in brussels as far as im aware so i feel powerless to do anything wtf ? 
   the eu does n't love scotland , the eu hates the uk .
