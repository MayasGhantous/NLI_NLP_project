  no , we love england , scotland , wales and northern ireland . 
  england and wales do n't love us back but that does n't change our feelings towards the other two . 
  well yeah . 
  betrayals are always an emotional topic . 
  you know that every post on immigration in this sub is regularly being brigaded by the far right , right ? 
  what you 're reading in those is n't `` the opinion of the sub '' . 
  like the irish you mean ? 
  well obviously there will be a new one this time around . 
  my point was they had a plan , the tories still run around like headless chicken because of brexit . 
  yeah , or maybe you should read a bit more before commenting . 
  [ no plan for the currency ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/sturgeon-scotland-will-keep-the-pound-and-apply-for-full-eu-membership-10807681 ) ? 
  and tell me again : how many pages did the snp whitepaper have that was published ** before ** the indyref ? 
  and how many pages did the tory , sorry `` government '' white paper have that was published months ** after ** the brexit referendum and only after a lawsuit and parliamentary pressure ? 
  no plan indeed . 
  proving the fucking point . 
  do you think the daily mail readers will agree with your assessment ? 
  and what do you mean by scottish ? 
  scots or scottish gaelic ? 
  even those of us that are scottish ? 
  the point is scotland and the rest of the uk are european whether you like it or not . 
  so we are going to continue to talk about it just as we were talking about the dutch election and the romanian protests . 
  scotland is part of europe , so we 're talking about an internal matter here . 
  the same is not the case when t_d talks about europe . 
  it 's the contrast with may that makes her stand out even more . 
  hearing someone who actually has a vision for her country but also a plan on how to get there and someone whose plan is not based on hate is so refreshing . 
  or someone who is n't impressed by him and quite obviously looks down on him as pathetic . 
  must be infuriating for someone with his bloated ego . 
  [ really ? 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/behold/2015/04/churches/one.jpg.crop.original-original.jpg ), 
  i tried to answer in a jokey way by highlighting a small part of the comment that is right and acting like that was the poster 's intention but it 's literally all wrong . 
  neither is he sticking to his principles nor is he democratically elected ( if we go by popular votes ) nor is merkel a criminal nor should she be tried nor did she bring ruin to southern or northern europe . 
  it 's almost impressive how thoroughly wrong they are . 
  he 's literally behaving like a toddler there . 
  every non-voter is just as much to blame as any trump voter . 
  it 's st. patrick 's day . 
  germany is irish now . 
  and the rest of the world , too . 
  even if the irish do n't like it . . 
  care to illuminate us how merkel was being rude ? 
  better than whatever the populists had planned ( which was nothing other than a vague notion of white pride ), 
  i 'm not even fucking surprised . 
  how about you name all these proxy wars and i tell you which ones were going on in europe at the same time ? 
  what ? 
  that 's objectively not true . 
  maybe for a small part of the late 19th century . 
  and they lose their staging grounds for the iraq war . 
  the closest fully equipped military hospital that treats almost all iraq casualties . 
  the drone command centre for all of northern africa . 
  the biggest internet listening post in europe . 
  and that 's just germany . 
  i did n't . 
  i quoted a comedian . 
  but whatever . 
  you can direct any criticism to @janboehm on twitter . 
  what i actually forgot is the [ link ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=bz8ap46ew-w ), 
  only to those that are already blinded by europhobia in the first place . 
  how can you be against schengen ? 
  or join, 
  do n't forget : the president of the us is an orange psychopath who is being controlled by an alcoholic nazi . 
  no , it was a damned if you do , a short amount of time in purgatory if you do n't kind of scenario . 
  and you chose eternal damnation . 
  and not getting enough votes in the election means you ca n't be in the government !, 
  how undemocratic !, 
  actually as long as it is through voting and not the mods it 's the very definition of democratic , is n't it ? 
  and vote out of the eu because `` we 're full '' * . 
  * actual brexiter talking point, 
   david davis is a good man . 
  maybe he 's in his private life . 
  in his professional life he 's an incompetent ideologue who 's in way over his head . 
  oh hey , i think you could pack in a bit more condescension towards germans if you try hard enough . 
  go on , then . 
  incidentally the german word for plaster of paris . 
  just use another fucking order . 
  sgips , igps , whatever . 
  why the fuck would anyone call someone else 's countries pigs ? 
  it 's so incredibly disrespectful . 
  idiots did n't even think to translate their propaganda into a language the followers of the accounts would understand . 
   saxon police ignores right-extremists ? 
  who would have thought . 
  i 'm shocked , shocked i tell you !, 
   reactivating deactivated weapons is one of europe 's main sources of illegal guns . 
  so why are we selling them to the public ? 
   bespoke ftas no offense , i know you 're just explaining you countrymen 's thinking but i really hate that phrase . 
  ** every ** trade agreement is bespoke . 
  there is no standard form that you just have to enter your details in and sign . 
  i 'm afraid you 're taking on brexiters ' terminology when you use terms like that . 
  ( others : * eurosceptic * instead of * europhobe * , * independent britain * instead of * post-brexit britain * , * red tape * instead of * regulations * , etc. 
  you get the idea ), 
  we 'd like to but we need to get rid of the csu first !, 
  doggerland being an untouched mesolithic landscape , is there going to be a requirement for an archaeological assessment , too ? 
  beautiful, 
  did you mean 19th ? 
  but yeah , i agree . 
  this would n't look out of place anywhere north of the alps and west of warsaw . 
   the latter , anyway ... oh , fuck off, 
  i 'm sure they already did as a response to gaggenau a few days ago . 
  there kinda was some sort of vote recently that i should n't be allowed to move there easily ? 
  one where a lot of the rhetoric was about how people like me are destroying the country ? 
  i like london , yes . 
  i also love the rural parts of england .
