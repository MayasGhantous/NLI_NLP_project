  it 's just that they do n't like me . 
   anyway , cue the hardline european continentals acting like they 've always given a shit about scotland and not that they want to use it as a stick to beat the uk with why do you think we do n't care about scotland ? 
  scotland is like the uk only they do n't hate us . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  before the referendum we thought all of the uk was like that . 
  which is admirable . 
  but not when you 're the official opposition in a time of huge change . 
  and completely botched the remain campaigning by not being willing to acknowledge that the policies blamed on the eu were actually the tories ' fault ( and the blairites ' of course ) . 
  the lib-dems dems are still being villified because the electorate do n't understand the role of a junior coalition partner . 
  i would n't say coalitions are n't quite understood there yet, 
  as is every single other kind of society . 
  why ? 
  you 're not in schengen . 
  this literally has no bearing on you whatsoever . 
  but hey , some eu bashing is always warranted , right ? 
  what do you mean by suddenly ? 
  of course there 's a munich-sylt connection ... 
  [ one main one they 're worried about ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence ) . 
  case in point : we 've been `` shitting '' a lot on the pis party these last two days , but not on the polish . 
  are you saying we need a caucasus caucus ? 
  [ pretty sure he 's not entirely human ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmuo-8s_0wg ) . 
  yeah but i doubt the piss party will be happier with pro-european schulz . 
  especially since they already started their character asassination in the very tv piece we 're talking about ... 
  eh , it 's ok . 
  i do n't mind my country being the big baddie for a party of lunatics . 
  i just fear that this anti-german sentiment spreads among their supporters and sets back german-polish relations even after pis are gone . 
  that would be a real shame , it was going so well between our countries a few year ago . 
  how are we the bad guys in that when every single other country also wanted tusk ? 
  i 'm impressed . 
  oh , i 'm sure it was tasty but at that price it must have been raised in horrible conditions . 
  i 'd rather buy a chicken less often but pay 7 or 8 $ per bird for a `` raised fairly '' one . 
  i realise that that probably also does n't guarantee a nice life for the bird but organic chicken is really too expensive for me . 
  it 's often something like 20 $ per bird . 
  and yes , i realise that makes me hypocritical . 
  basically : ----------------------------------------------- do you want a dictatorship ? 
  ### \u2611 yes ^ ^ ^ \u2610 ^ ^ ^ no ------------------------------------------, 
  uhm , it 's the same person . 
  please do n't think all germans are so arrogant !, 
   i just bought a whole chicken for 2.99 . 
  all i had to do was put it in the oven . 
  it came in its own tin . 
  ( imho this price is criminal ) sorry , but i would n't eat that . 
  like with the us , uk , hungary , turkey and others i am pretty sure that almost no one here hates the actual people , just the government ( and maybe their more hardcore voters ) . 
  yeah , i 've lived in reykjav\u00edk for about three years all in all . 
  once at the beginning of the boom in 2010 and then recently . 
  the differences were huge and i have a feeling it 's only accelerating ... 
  my understanding is that iceland was saved by the fluke that it was discovered as a major tourist destination shortly after the crash ( probably because it got cheaper to go there and because icelandair massively pushed their three-day stopover policy on us-europe runs . 
  that major influx of cash is propping up the economy but it 's also unsustainable without a lot of investment ( such as a keflav\u00edk-reykjav\u00edk link ( whether by rail as suggested or through a more convenient bus link ( getting rid of bs\u00cd ) is irrelevant ) , or actually asking for money for sar ) and without controlling the reykjav\u00edk rental market . 
  and all for the small price of selling your soul to tourism !, 
  ( not that i blame you ), 
  i hate to burst any bubbles but it 's [ quite likely ] ( https://www.thefreelibrary.com/were+the+caves+a+victorian+invention%3f-a0278313623 ) that it 's a victorian folly . 
  sometimes i really hate the fact that as an archaeologist it 's part of my job to take the romance out of the past . 
  edit : should read the article next time instead of assuming it 's the same one i 've seen on facebook over and over again over the last week . 
  this one acknowledges the dating . 
  at this point it 's more likely the us wo n't . 
  yeah but the problem is n't hillary it 's that they somehow managed to get the narrative out there that she 's basically the antichrist when she 's just your run-of-the-mill washington career politician . 
  i think you 'll find very few europeans called romney or mccain evil , or even cared a lot . 
  if you had at least chosen bush or palin ... 
  do n't forget \u00d3rban !, 
  you 're presuming they called him a racist and a misogynist as an election strategy and not because he 's , well , a racist and a misogynist . 
  not a building as in there are no roofs . 
  then why has france repeatedly offered to share its nuclear arsenal with germany ? 
  it 's not that it 's on the internet . 
  i just would n't want a government official to read my chat logs ( or text messages or letters ) . 
  even if i 'm allowed to choose wat they see ( and it will thus not be intimate or confidential information ) it still feels incredibly wrong for them to see my inane conversations . 
  also , what possible use could it have for the government to read my messages of `` should i buy flour on the way home ? 
  i think we 're out of flour '' ? 
   i do n't remember the name of those sweet biscuit balls , but they were def prettier than tastie [ schneeballen ] ( http://www.bayern.by/data/mediadb/cms_pictures/%7b49eff619-0818-f6e6-af70-32ecac6059e3%7d.jpg ) . 
  a specialty of our region . 
  rothenburg was besieged and taken by tilly in 1631 . 
  it was only spared pillaging because the mayor managed to drink 3.25 l of wine in one draught . 
  if anything it proves walls do n't work and drinking copious amounts of booze does . 
  maybe try that instead of supporting trump ? 
  but skype logs ? 
  that 's a huge invasion of privacy !, 
  ( and also ridiculously easy to forge ) . 
   the new chevy cruze is basically a ~ ~ cheaper ~ ~ uglier version of opel astra . 
  ftfy, 
  he 's paying for so much these days that he 's spread a bit thin . 
  running the global liberal elite is expensive . 
  how about you get out of germany ? 
  half-measures only hurt the uk . 
  why would eea membership hurt the uk ? 
  if that were the see she 'd go for a softer brexit . 
  in reality she was probably never really remain , just kept quiet and stuck to the boss 's line . 
  and now she sees brexit as an opportunity to live out her dreams of authoritarianism . 
  she tried as home secretary after all and came up against the echr . 
  an institution she also wants to leave although it 's not an eu one . 
  another one that comes to mind is the [ weimaraner ] ( https://grosse-hunderassen.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/weimaraner-zuechter-640x381.jpg ) . 
  i did not know karst was a region !, 
  i only know it as the geological phenomenon but it makes total sense it would be named after a place !, 
  well i for one stayed out of that thread * because * all the comments there were from mras and i did n't have the energy to do the same spiel over and over . 
  it 's sellf-reinforcing and only really depends on who discovers a thread first . 
  unfortunately that woman 's day thread was discovered by assholes . 
  [ well that 's no fun !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/3952cpyi6j4?t=31 ), 
  i know you 're joking but i was genuinely surprised how strong the reactions were to that off-handed joke of mine ... 
  anyone who complains about the `` mainstream media '' so much they need an abbreviation for it is not worth listening to . 
  since when has this turned into a news sub ? 
   if he was smart i see a flaw in the plan ...
