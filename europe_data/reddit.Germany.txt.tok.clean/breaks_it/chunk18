   visa rejection rate lower than 3 % ( none of the countries meet this requirement what the hell ? 
  only the us has control over that , not the countries of origin !, 
  unless the man-baby hears about it on fox news, 
  do n't you think you 're comparing greek home cooking with turkish restaurant food ? 
  i 'm sure turkish mothers also mainly make simple dishes ... 
   well coffee is n't restricted only in greece . 
  first google image result for [ greek coffee ] ( https://search.chow.com/thumbnail/1280/800/www.chowstatic.com/assets/recipe_photos/28232_greek_coffee.jpg ) [ turkish coffee ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/t%c3%bcrk_kahvesi_-_bakir_cezve.jpg/220px-t%c3%bcrk_kahvesi_-_bakir_cezve.jpg ) [ french coffee ] ( http://www.cognacfans.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/french-coffee.jpg ) [ american coffee ] ( http://donkeybakery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/screen-shot-2015-02-27-at-10.50.44-am.png ), 
   you said that they 're essentially the same yet you brought only 3 examples . 
  well , there are not so many remaining examples that you can bring tbh . 
  there are : greek coffee/turkish coffee , baklava , moussakka/patl \u0131can musakka , spanakopita/ispanakl \u0131 tepsi b\u00f6re\u011fi , kefthedes/k \u00f6fte ... 
  i could go on and on . 
  interestingly enough this is [ the second discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wrbm6/alsace_like_germany_but_cuter/ded41fp/?st=izu07ipp&amp;sh=43a66bb4 ) on how food relates to national borders i 've had in 3 days . 
  i maintain here what i said then : i think food is very much a continuum and not affected by national borders as much as we think . 
  as such turkish and greek cuisine are very similar in the border regions and different in the regions further apart . 
  and that 's why i was only half-joking above . 
  seriously ? 
  obviously there are differences ( pork being the most obvious one ) but they are part of the same continuum and not as unique as many on both sides say . 
  that makes his views all the worse then !, 
  do n't tell the greeks or the turks that their two cuisines are essentially the same !, 
  oh , i can recycle my other comment in this thread :  of course we would have an mra in this thread defending the literal holocaust-denier and antisemite . 
  huh , when i read that i thought `` hey , that 's actually kinda clever '' . 
  glad to see he did n't come up with it himself . 
  why do you think we `` invited '' all those syrians ? 
  when the d\u00f6ner exodus starts the shwarma army ( shwarmy ? ), 
  is ready . 
  thanks , merkel !, 
   if some random dude said it at his office , he 'd probably be shunned by all the ~ ~ female ~ ~ employees in that office ftfy . 
  or at least i hope so . 
  pretty much what your mep said . 
  that was great . 
  she was awesome . 
  nuh , that was very much calculated to imply the parliament is at fault . 
  it is the telegraph after all . 
  more subtle than its tabloid brethren but all the more insidious as a result . 
  i think thanks to the internet everybody knows about that one . 
  that 's the curse of the english language , i guess . 
  or blessing , rather . 
  i see it thus : the european values the commission represents are the values of the eu : solidarity , deeper integration , regionalism over nationalism , these kinds of things . 
  the council is the counterweight representing national interests of the member states which are often ( mildly ) at odds with the commission . 
  and the parliament represents individuals who according to the political situation in their country and their personal ethics are often leaning one of the two ways . 
  thus the parliament acts as a decider in the balance of nationalism vs internationalism . 
  yeah diesel is another name for it . 
  because it 's explicitly limited until there 's reciprocity . 
  but i 'm pretty sure under trump they wo n't back down . 
  so that 's 4 years of restricted travel to the us for me . 
  i can live with that . 
  yeah i know , i 'm being rather idealistic there . 
  it would n't play well in the media . 
  though tbh here in germany i do n't think it would make much difference . 
  if it goes against trump it 'll play well and the few europhobes are already against the concept anyway . 
   the eu commission ** is legally obliged ** to take measures temporarily reintroducing visa requirements for us citizens , given that washington still does not grant visa-free access to nationals of five eu countries . 
  as a german i 'm fine with that . 
   enjoy your culture being invaded and changed . 
  huh ? 
  i thought the euparl just voted against the invasion ? 
  it 's what the whole thread is about !, 
  they were talking about being treated as an equal . 
  if we all go down we 'll go down together at least . 
   these institutions all have specific roles . 
  the commission is the european body that needs to represent european values and interests . 
  the parliament represents the european citizens . 
  the council represents the member states and the court makes sure there is an objective , neutral procedure available for disagreements . 
  this is the best explanation i 've read yet why there are all these different institutions . 
  well done !, 
  most german shandys ( `` radler '' ) are with clear lemonade as well . 
  it 's really only wheat beer that 's mixed with coke and then only for day drinking as a refresher or for teenagers . 
  [ oh , and then there 's this abomination ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/76/6d/f5/766df558f0e748e64413c01f532fc409.jpg ) . 
  but that 's berlin , they 're weird . 
  no , they 're saying `` if the us requires visas for poles , ** the schengen zone ** must all require visas for americans . 
   i can go wherever i please thank you except most of the eu soon . 
  if a random old woman from romania can potentially visit her grandkids in the us for the first time in return ? 
  why not ? 
   money . 
  many european nations gdp is tied to ~ ~ us ~ ~ chinese and japanese tourism . 
  ftfy, 
   can you imagine how that would effect ireland ? 
  not at all , since ireland is not in schengen . 
  they 'd actually probably profit from being the only eu country americans can travel to visa-free once the uk leaves . 
  yeah , i do n't quite see the problem . 
  you can travel freely in and out of the schengen zone now as well after all . 
  security theatre, 
  with much gnashing of teeth . 
  those are popular these days . 
  i 'm for blocking anyone from connecticut , new hampshire , maine , massachusetts , rhode island or vermont until the copyright infringement of the term * new england * is resolved . 
  you have shandys as well , do n't you ? 
  ( you as in your country , not necessarily you personally ), 
  well i 'm sorry that happened . 
  yeah , my guess would either be security theatre or that they knew a person of interest was on the flight and they wanted to make it look like it was a random control of everybody . 
  no , those are great . 
  going by this user 's post they 're not really a great dane . 
  did you ever learn why that was ? 
   i was in favor of poland requiring americans to have visas but if the eu wants to get involved , fine by me . 
  and that 's the beauty of the eu system : a single country threatening that has no chance to convince the us . 
  28 countries , including some of the leading economies or the world threatening the same is a different matter . 
  before the referendum i would have said that that can be easily resolved by the uk graciously stepping aside in decisions that do n't affect them but now of course i realise that there is nothing gracious about may and the merry brexiteers and they will block anything they can if they think they can use it as leverage or just out of spite . 
   the difference between a german sauerkraut and an alsatian one . 
  it 's not the same shit . 
  are you saying that if i get a plate of choucroute in neuf-brisach and a plate of sauerkraut in breisach there is a substantial difference ? 
  is n't it more that difference in food traditions is a function of geographical distance ? 
  so the sauerkraut i have here in franconia ( which is probably more like what you think of when you think `` german sauerkraut '' ) is different from that in alsace , but also from that in baden , yet closer to that in bohemia ; although that 's also in a different country ?
