  because they stabbed us in the back . 
  of course the reaction is going to be different to what it would be towards a country that has never been in the eu . 
  exactly the same tactic leave used with the # 350mil bus . 
  it just works which is probably why it 's so popular these days . 
  [ let 's be realistic here ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/01/21/erdogan.jpg ), 
  you know as well as i do that the rhetoric was against the people , not the institution before the referendum . 
  and more importantly so do the electorates that eu politicians ultimately have to answer to . 
  i 'm repulsed by his populism and the utter lack of morals he demonstrated by lying about his qualifications . 
  and even more so by the fact that the electorate was ready to forgive him simply because he had a pretty face ( for a politician ) , slimy hair and a title . 
  then we get ministerpr\u00e4sident s\u00f6der or \\* shudder * the lying baron himself . 
   conniving ( or just really gullible ? ), 
  both at the same time . 
  the two reinforce each other . 
  and please call them * europhobes * , not * eurosceptics * . 
  scepticism is healthy and everybody should exercise it but these people are against the eu on principle , no matter how much good it does . 
  they hate it , they are n't simply sceptical . 
  unfortunately they could publicly execute someone and bavaria would still vote for them . 
   and will puncture the * amicability of our future relationship too late . 
  months of a very public campaign telling us we 're unwanted has already done that . 
  that has been answered thoroughly by cameron calling a referendum in the first place , by boris switching sides , by may going full hardline . 
  it 's their careers first , the party second , their business friends third , the country fourth . 
  or if there is a `` anti-independence '' guide you just copy-paste . 
  i 'm sure there is . 
  it goes something like this : - spain !, 
  - but budget deficit !, 
  - the oil price has crashed , they have no money !, 
  - evil , evil euro !, 
  - scots hate the english , i 'll be glad to see them go !, 
  - something about sturgeon or the snp daring to be social democrats rather than tories , and surprise that the scots ( like the rest of europe ) like that . 
  a combination of the above is every single anti-indyref post i see here at least . 
  i did n't but there 's no way to prove that to you anyway . 
  `` just a prank bro ! '', 
  `` they only say that because i 'm on the right ! '', 
  and `` totally did n't mean that but i mean , we 'll see what happens '' . 
  all the classics of right-wing apologia . 
  not very convincing . 
  american police are being trained by scottish police on how to deescalate crime without guns . 
  so what is the context ? 
  positive ? 
   also , one direction came from the uk . 
  every country hates their rich people , except the americans . 
  why the hell are beef wellington and toad in the hole on the negatives list ? 
  bl\u00fccher was irish ? 
  got is partly shot in norn iron but is an american production otherwise ( hbo ) . 
  apparently nazis are the core constituency of the spd ? 
  idk . 
   , they reminds me of sturmabteilung the sa you absolute numpty . 
  in a thread about the white rose ? 
  have some fucking respect , man !, 
  hey , he 's not pretending !, 
  i 'm sure he 's 1/32nd scottish and thus entitled to that flair !, 
  a hot dog is not a sandwich !, 
  nothing at all . 
  you must lead a strange life if gaston is your role model ... 
   `` chocolate . . thingy in this case i 'd translate `` schokoteilchen '' as `` chocolate danish '' . 
  that 's so weird . 
  in every bakery i 've been to ( mostly in bavaria and baw\u00fc ) [ this ] ( https://images.gutefrage.net/media/fragen/bilder/schokobroetchen-vs-schokocroissant/0_original.jpg?v=1367064679000 ) is a schokocroissant and the above is labeled a pain au chocolat . 
  pain au chocolat edit : no idea why this is being downvoted but that 's what they 're called in ( southern ) germany . 
  east obviously . 
  they 're on the eastern front . 
  coasts vs mainland . 
  the ultimate two front war . 
   let 's get something straight : the minimum 2 % of the gdp of every nato member for defense purposes was ~ ~ an obligation ~ ~ a non-binding goal every member agreed ~ ~ upon ~ ~ to reach by 2024 . 
  ftfy . 
  nobody says that 's a bad thing . 
  but trump wants it by the end of the year . 
  that 's not only impossible but also would be interpreted at bowing to that asshole so i 'm with juncker here : by all means reach the 2 % , but not on an accelerated schedule , and use european integration to build a strong army rather than many weak but large ones . 
  you know that uncle sam wants you poster ? 
  imagine that but with sparkles and more leather . 
   `` i am wondering ... does it really matter what i say ? 
  or what you write ? 
  noone cares a shit about it , because people have already made up their minds . 
  they believe what they read . 
  and what they want to believe . 
  it makes me angry as a bull . 
  do n't you accuse me of lying about which people are coming into our church . 
  i know that better than the people sitting in macedonia . 
  or in the usa . 
   the priest leans forward looking straight at me . 
   her eyes are filled with tears of rage . 
  perfectly describes the absolute helplessness i feel against these narratives . 
  if you can tell people that smething is made up and even show them sources and they turn around and continue to share the story what can you do ? 
  i do n't at all agree with the other person 's rhetoric but they have a point that while you should absolutely still have the right to participate the gentlemanly thing would be to step aside . 
   finally , farmers and agriculture plays an important role in managing the landscape and the ecology of a nation . 
  with subsidies , a state can control which types of pesticides or farming techniques are preferably used . 
  that way , soil and water bodies can be kept intact , without getting flooded with pesticides . 
  that part i 've been telling to brexiters who have a hard-on for complete deregualtion and `` competition '' with the likes of argentina and the us : say goodbye to hedgerows and biodiversity then . 
  yeah , maybe i should have said `` demagogues '' , though we 'll see whether schulz turns out to be a populist or not . 
  words have meanings , you know . 
   the liberals seem to be completely unfazed by the prospect that , according to their ( hyperbolic or not ) world view , half of americans are mentally ill racists . 
  i find this deeply troubling . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  they 're not unfazed at all , they 're completely appalled . 
  fuck off with your red-pill alt-right bullshit . 
  occam 's razor says he 's a clueless , spoiled narcissist who happens to be good at one thing and one thing only : convincing people that he is n't . 
  pretty sure he has n't drawn a firm line in the sand , just hinted at it . 
  but that would be good i guess . 
   anyone aware of political history in the us should understand the reference . 
  tbf that excludes trump . 
   also , using the phrase vollst\u00e4ndiger sieg ( = absolute victory ) is very close to goebbels ' totaler krieg ( = total war ) .
