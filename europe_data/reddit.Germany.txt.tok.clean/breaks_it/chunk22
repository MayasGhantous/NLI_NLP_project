  i 'm disappointed . 
   actually i think that no cities , streets , rivers etc. 
  should be ever renamed . 
  and what communists did was wrong . 
  but we should n't make the same errors now , we should stop . 
  if anything was already renamed - keep it , but no more renamings . 
  oh god . 
  we would have so many adolf hitler squares . 
  you seem to be under a misapprehension about what we mean by flatbottomed in early shipbuilding research . 
  see the difference ? 
  afaik the copies of the deutschlandlied that contain all stanzas have not been burned . 
  nothing was destroyed . 
  [ does this look flat-bottomed to you ? 
  i see nothing sad in that . 
  it 's a noble goal to make sure that something like that does not happen again . 
  of course they do . 
  as they should . 
  and our national anthem is the third stanza of the deutschlandlied , not the whole thing . 
  see how i made you angry with just two words above ? 
  why ca n't you accept that this is an equally emotional topic for us ? 
  for now . 
  they tried to sing against it but ultimately failed . 
   this a bit shitty for me -- a leftist nerd who likes nordic history ... 
  try being a viking age scholar !, 
  it 's infuriating . 
  what ? 
  in this context it absolutely is . 
  the other one being the first cogs which appeared in the north-sea region in the 10th century or so . 
  unlike nordic ships they were flat-bottomed but ( as you say ) still clinker-built in the beginning . 
  actually you will see that the anglo-saxon are using exactly the same design ( the only difference being that they are missing part of the top strake ) . 
  these are n't so much `` viking-style longships '' as they are the dominant ( well technically one of the two dominant ) styles of shipbuilding in northern europe at the time . 
  they 're seeing ( i.e. 
  perceiving ) the bet , not asking to see the cards . 
  was ? 
  well once you 've done it for 500 years you can still call yourself a brewery even if it 's a two-man-bathtub operation . 
  any bigger city ? 
  of course . 
  not so much if you move to a smaller village . 
  of course it helps if you do but especially if you 're highly qualified and highly paid you can just hire people to do your paperwork . 
  no , but you 're one of the more prominent brexit supporters here . 
  i come across your posts a lot and ca n't remember something like that . 
  feel free to link to an example though . 
  really ? 
  a large country like germany will have a national team for pretty much any sport you can imagine . 
  probably including quidditch , aussie rules football , hurling or mongolian wrestling ... 
  why the fuck would they need to speak german ? 
  i still do n't understand how freedom of movement , the greatest achievement of the eu is seen as a fucking negative , a burden , in the uk . 
  it boggles my mind . 
  let 's hope so . 
  my biggest gripe with brexit is free movement and switzerland has that . 
   i 'm very bored of people simplifying brexit down to a personal relationship between a man and a wife . . 
  does that also apply to the hundreds of brexiters i 've seen that liken brexit to a woman getting out of an abusive relationship ? 
  because i have n't seen you rebuke them . 
  you do n't know what liberalism is , apparently . 
  `` oppressed by liberalism '' is an oxymoron , moron . 
  yeah , so the answer is to scapegoat us instead of your government ? 
  oh shit , i was joking . 
  well i guess it 's good to see that these immature opinions are often held by actually immature people . 
  it 's easy to forget on the inetrnet sometimes . 
  probably not old enough to vote . 
  i 'm not sure whether you mean mutually assured destruction or milit\u00e4rischer abschirmdienst there . 
  both work . 
  well mostly it says that you can be proud of czechia , if we compare it with its eastern neighbours there 's a marked difference . 
   the uk will not/is not breaking apart due to the brexit . 
  jury 's still out on that . 
   as of 2013 , the largest group of modern polonia can be found in the united kingdom ( 550,000 ) , [ 17 ] followed by that in germany ( 425,608 ) . , [ 5 ] [ 17 ] in france ( 350,000 as of 2012 ) , [ 17 ] significant polish presence can also be found in ireland ( 115 , 000 as of 2013 ) , in italy ( 94,000 as of 2011 ) , in the netherlands ( 103,000 as of 2013 ) yeah , no . 
  [ ^ ^ source ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/migrations_from_poland_since_eu_accession ), 
   also , are the greens taken seriously anywhere in the world ? 
  the german greens are currently in government in 11 of the 16 states . 
  not just in parliament , mind you , but in government . 
  this [ map shows the current situation . 
  dark green is the green party as a major coalition partner , medium green as a minor coalition partner and light green means they are in parliament but not in government . ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/b\u00fcndnis_90/die_gr\u00fcnen#/media/datei%3agr%c3%bcne_landtage.svg ) . 
  so yeah , they 're taken very seriously . 
  they were also the minor coalition partner in government before merkel was elected . 
  that said currently they 're in a bit of a slump . 
  and i 'll take any bet that proficiency in japanese is higher in the anime fan community than among the general population . 
  tbf , when you 're famous they let you do it . 
  they 're not incompetent , they 'd just like to do anything else rather than work . 
   no longer any kind of `` schnapsideen '' i just hope they somehow do n't manage to implement dobrindt 's autobahnmaut until then ... 
  he gave it to gazprom as a gift and completely unrelated to that received a personal gift of money . 
  the spd got nothing out of it . 
  considering i live just about north of the border ( literally a few km , i can almost see the limes from here ) i really do n't want to be counted as northern german , though !, 
  yeah but that does n't protect an outer eu border , although part of the danubian limes go through serbia , a non-eu country . 
  but then again , the danubian limes is n't technically a wall ... 
  afaik that wall is entirely within england . 
  there is one [ in scotland as well , though ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/roman_vallum_of_the_antonine_wall%2c_scotland.jpg/1024px-roman_vallum_of_the_antonine_wall%2c_scotland.jpg ) . 
   all i am saying is war is never clear cut . 
  the falklands were an invasion , and it took considerable cajoling and effort to get some sanctions in place to protect the sacrosanct principle of self determination . 
  it would have been impossible to convince other members to put in soldiers or money . 
  not if it were part of he military treaties that european teritories and dependencies are sacrosanct . 
  then the eu military would have needed to react . 
  and that 's discounting the fact of course that argentina probably would n't even have invaded had they known such a rule existed . 
  uhm , what ? 
  you know i 'm talking about germany when i say `` we '' , right ? 
  there goes food security and the cultural landscape that agriculture has shaped over millennia . 
  that 's because in general these countries do n't think they are more important than they are in the grand scheme of things . 
  though i 'm sure there are aspects of these countries ' collective psyches that can and have been explained like that . 
  have you seen ( large parts of ) [ the uk agricultural landscape ] ( http://www.whatcomcd.org/sites/default/files/hedgerows/hrs%20in%20the%20english%20countryside%20aerial%20view.bmp ) ? 
  good luck mechanising that further . 
  ah , the clearly defined metric of `` greatness '' .
