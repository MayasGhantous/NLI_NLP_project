  yeah , no , thanks . 
  we tried that twice . 
  i really think that maybe you 're just missing the outside perspective on your culture . 
  maybe the rest of the world sees something in your actions that you ca n't see because you 're caught up in your national myths and media ( as we all are when it comes to our cultures ) the way a therapist can see the motivations behind a patient 's behaviour even if they ca n't . 
  just think about whether that may be true , i 'm just asking for an open mind . 
  remember that anything that impacts farming also impacts the cultural landscape around you . 
  for example ( though that applies more to the south and the midlands than scotland ) if there 's unsubsidised free-market farming and a reduction in environmental legislation say goodbye to hedgerows and biodiversity . 
  new zealand is also mostly farmland/grazing area . 
  they can compete on a different level than farmers in densely populated europe can . 
   if the americans have such data on pro-russian people they are more than welcome to publish it . 
  with their resources it should n't be difficult . 
  these days the americans do n't have any interest in preventing a pro-russian candidate anymore . 
  well there 's rt fran\u00e7ais among the outlets in the op . 
  though no idea how many are reading that in france ... 
  he certainly is ( or was when i grew up ) in germany . 
  i was actually more thinking of her obsession with the snoopers charter and leaving the echr that she seems to have carried over from her tenure as home secretary . 
  choosing the hardliners ' view on brexit is more of an afterthought compared to this . 
  but yeah , whatever , mate . 
  they 're all part of the resurgence of the right that this is a reaction to . 
  it 's a continuum of course . 
  yeah , you 're right !, 
  i forgot putin !, 
  and then there 's [ gladstone ] ( http://www.hmtreasurycareers.co.uk/insights/2016/07/gladstone/ ) working in the treasury , [ palmerston ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/palmerston_%2826341788971%29.jpg/800px-palmerston_%2826341788971%29.jpg ) in the foreign office and [ evie and ossie in the cabinet office ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/09/new-cat-evie-joins-westminster-moggies-cabinet-office-mouser ) of course . 
  someone should write a shitty talking cat movie about them , really . 
  every action has an equal and opposite reaction . 
  i guess we should thank trump and may , \u00d3rban , erdogan and kaczy\u0144ski . 
  mmmhmm , i love intensive porpoise soup ... 
  a complete asshole of an ambassador might be a good thing in terms of uniting europeans . 
  yeah , if he is rejected it sends a strong signal to europeans that the eu listens to them and is a strong entity with self-respect . 
  if it accepts him however it looks weak and out of touch . 
  so yes , he might unite us but only if the eu rejects him . 
  interesting theory . 
  but would n't announcing a contingency plan ( the uk becoming a tax haven ) undermine that strategy because you now have an out ? 
  are you . . are you celebrating your own ignorance of geography and world affairs ? 
  maybe if the campaign against us had been run maturely and pragmatially we would respond in kind . 
   ~ ~ that 'll be ~ ~ i bet that was fun . 
  happy ? 
  that he is . 
  he still has a truckload more integrity than tillerson . 
  and considering his occasional lapses of judgement i hope [ this ] ( http://bilder1.n-tv.de/img/incoming/crop18433336/8761323857-cimg_16_9-w1200/gabriel-mittelfinger.jpg ) is how they parted . 
   foreign minister sigmar gabriel is expected to meet his newly appointed u.s. counterpart rex tillerson for talks in washington later on thursday ~ ~ that 'll be ~ ~ i bet that was fun . 
  former exxon executive meets former union worker and minister for the environment . 
  both probably . 
  i sense a trend . 
  he did n't go back on it , trump did . 
  looks a bit like a wes anderson tableau . 
  if only it were shot a bit more head-on instead of at an angle . 
  well mostly he speaks for bannon . 
   the people did n't vote him in . 
  where have i heard that before ? 
  someone who switched from bernie to trump is almost worse than someone who mindlessly voted for the latter . 
  you walked into this with open eyes you fool . 
  `` i have black friends ! '', 
  yeah , but not because focus has gotten any better . 
  it 's just that more and more people get abitur . 
   all trump is showing me is the importance that the media is tamed before or while an anti-globalist leader takes power . 
  reforming the media must be at the top of the list of any new nationalist administration . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  you just seem to support that for some reason . 
  someone once argued that for a time in the 19th century the first giant statue they would see was not lady liberty but the [ giant elephant ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/elephantine_colossus ) on coney island . 
   fucked the eu up ? 
  good . 
  that 's why . 
  abstaining in the face of a candidate like that is only marginally better than voting for him though . 
   if the world can take anything away from the calamity that is happening currently in the us , it 's that their systems can be susceptible to the same mechanisms that brought about the current situation in our country . 
  science and education are the best tools to fight these outside influences on rational thought and ideology . 
  indeed . 
  the famously ghostwritten book ? 
   donald trump and the insanity he supports is not reflective of most americans actually , it kinda is : you elected him . 
  and yes it 's not a majority but still it 's worrying that slightly less than half of americans wanted real estate salesman and part-time president donald trump to do anything more than entertain them with his shitty reality tv show . 
  edit : just to make this clear , i 'm not saying i hate americans now . 
  i have friends there after all . 
  i just find it hard to even understand the mindset of half your country . 
   i pay very little attention to his posturing , and just watch what he actually does . 
  yeah that 's a mistake since he 's pretty much trying to do everything he promised on the campaign trail . 
  that sounds good in theory but in practice countries where academisation is rampant do n't fare much better in elections ( * cough * uk * cough * us * cough * ), 
  i could n't have said it better . 
  i think the influence of [ gerd ruge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerd_ruge ) and his series of documentaries on life in russia should also not be underestimated when it comes to shaping germans ' picture of russia . 
  i for one still get chills when i hear [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf9_9mzyqgo ) . 
  it conjures up images of a wild untamed east full of opportunity and adventure . 
  we still do despite the brexit thing . 
  it 's a bit irrational . 
  yeah but we do n't want to tear down europe just to please one member . 
  what 's the point of the whole.project at that point ? 
  fucking finally . 
  although  rather than go through the process of publicly refusing him after the fact , it would be better for the commission to hint to washington early on that malloch is an unacceptable choice . 
  yeah , no . 
  this iteration of washington does n't understand hints or any form of the subtelty that is so common in international diplomacy . 
   yeah right , but the descendents of the refugees , some of them ** might ** be future attackers . 
  ** if ** they do n't integrate . 
  not much , yeah right . 
  solid ground you 're on there , pal . 
  are you american ? 
  you ca n't just label anything socialist that 's not 100 % free-market free-for-all . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  who likes getting no interest on their saved money ? 
  it just occurred to me that if that comes to trump 's attention he 'll be flattered , not offended . 
  because idiot that he is he 'd take it at face value and actually believe these countries were petitioning him to stay relevant . 
  and yet no one is calling for electoral reform . 
  for one mep ?
