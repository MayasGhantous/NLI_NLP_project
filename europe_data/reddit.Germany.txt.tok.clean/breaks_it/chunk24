  no way that calculation is correct . 
  if you mean for all of them then yes , it 's good value for money . 
  i do n't think such planes exist ( outside of the us at least ? ) . 
  think about it : when do you really need to move a planeload of prisoners all at once ? 
  in reality they either use a bus or an officer is escorting the prisoner on a commercial flight . 
  yeah , same here . 
  then again considering they would reduce the number of cars i guess existing parking lots could be repurposed . 
  not really viable if you live right in a historic city centre of course , but then again it 's not easy having a normal car there either . 
  happens to the best of us . 
  let 's see : ** - corrupt : ** in the sense that he 's taking money from the institution he 's morally against , but ** no ** i do n't think he 's taken monetary compensation in return for enacting a certain policy - mostly because he does n't attend enough that he could influence policy ** - scambag : ** that 's a new one . 
  ** yes ** , he has scammed the british public into voting agaist their interests with pictures of migrants that ca n't even get to the uk and other dirty tricks . 
  or did you mean : ** - scumbag : ** oh hell , ** yes ** . 
  he 's a hypocrite of the highest order ( see above , taking eu money , not attending , having an eu citizen wife and children , etc. . . ) ** - charlatan : ** is there any question ? 
  ** yes ** ** - pot calling the kettle [ black ] : ** ** yes , ** see above under hypocrite . 
  their concept art certainly seems to suggest that . 
  the relevance is that i agree that there 's a qualitative difference between the two examples . 
  i disagree however that what he did was the less reprehensible thing . 
  it 's only a few cents off my paycheck . 
  yeah , spending it on yourself is simple corruption , spending it on dismantling the entity that gives you the money would be treason if it were a nation state instead of an international union . 
  one is indeed worse than the other . 
  so , misusing , then ... 
   electric, 
  let 's hope so . 
  she 's stubborn , though , and would do almost anything to not appear weak on europe to her voters . 
  it was before he announced his candidacy so most people would only have known him as parliamentary president or not at all i guess ... 
  well i guess you 're conditioned from birth to like slightly weird local soft drinks from mountainous regions . 
  have you ever tried [ rivella ] ( http://www.darido.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rivella.jpg ) , the swiss soft drink based on milk serum of all things ? 
  a scot who knows almdudler ? 
   scandinavia due to the proximity of the uk has chosen a bilingual approach of education have . . have you seen the channel ? 
  the country closest to britain is ... france . 
  it 's not about proximity , it 's about being too small a linguistic community to make it economically viable to dub movies . 
  that 's literally all that 's behind the famous nordic proficiency in english . 
  oh the fucking irony . 
  do we want to ? 
   in just his first week he triggered diplomatic crises with nieto , abe and merkel do n't forget turnbull today ...  . 
  most likely after a couple of months putin will be trump 's only ally worldwide . 
  and his little lapdog theresa may . 
  that would lead to a new financial crisis . 
  as horrible as president pence would be , for the rest of the world he would be better than a collapse of the us . 
  ironically she would probably still be better than * real estate salesman and part-time president donald trump * . 
  she 's vocally anti-trump at least , so must be better . 
  at least for 90 days until extreme vetting of their drinking habits can occur . 
   celebrate nazi germany sattellite ww2 slovak state and yet are welcoming night wolves when they passed through to celebrate victory of red army in ww2 wtf ? 
  how does that make any sense to even the thickest of their members ? 
  that does n't change the fact that kohl did n't want the euro and mitterrand blackmailed him to give up the dm in exchange for agreeing to reunification . 
  that is a well-known historical fact at this point . 
  he 's an alt-righter . 
  they have famously thin skin and especially if you attack anything regarding their nation . 
  i have n't written an sms in literally years . 
  i use fb messenger and whatsapp daily , however . 
  the odds are pretty low actually . 
  and there are signs the even le pen would n't take france out of the eu . 
  and i pointed out some examples where that took a while . 
   as any other union did throughout the history . 
  no , you did . 
  oh yeah , the old nazi thing . 
  have n't ever heard that before . 
  check mate , you win thanks to your superior argument and extremely original allusion . 
  yeah , took the roman empire 500 years and the holy roman empire 1000 . 
  so enjoy your wait i guess . 
  wait , you think grovelling may was the hero in all this ? 
  fyi merkel also got such a statement out of him ... while openly criticising his policies . 
  i wonder what they would say if austria invaded alto adige ... 
  your oompa loompa president and his designated ambassador to the eu have both said they want to break up the eu . 
  that 's why they 're called a threat . 
  because they said they are . 
  closer political union : yes , absolutely . 
  complete federalism : there is no appetite for that in the electorate of any eu country . 
  tge thing about the daily mail and it 's ilk is that you do n't have to read them to be influenced by them . 
  there is no media in the uk that is not coloured by internalised europhobia . 
  and yes , i do include the guardian and the indy in this.so no wonder you would think federalism i 'd on the table . 
  it 's discussed in certain circles of the parliament but the real heavy hitters in the eu are the member states and none of them want it . 
  saying the eu is headed for federalism i 'd like saying the uk is headed for socialism because corbyn has uttered support for it at one point in his life . 
  despite what the daily mail is telling you it 's still not heading towards a federalist state . 
   britain saw the ( then ) eec as an economic project . 
  only later did it turn into a political union , which the british simply never wanted . 
  can this myth please fucking die already ? 
  [ here , this is a guardian article from 1962 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/eu-european-union-political-union-in-out-eec ) . 
  notice how they speak of political union and whether the uk should join that project . 
  including discussions of sovereignty . 
  the eu and its predecessors were never ever ever intended to be an economic union only and the uk was very aware of that from the very fucking beginning !, 
  i 'd argue that it might be possible right now . 
  with all the anger at the orange utan there might be enough critical mass to switch to a social network that 's specifically advertised as european but open to all . 
  unfortunately it would need to be available right now , if we started developing one now the moment would be gone by the time it was ready . 
  and it would need a huge marketing budget to get people to switch . 
  indeed . 
  and that is why brexit was an utterly stupid idea . 
  do you have an idea for an alternative moniker then ? 
  because i really do think that `` eurosceptic '' is the wrong word . 
  there is a material difference between someone who is sceptical of something and someone who will never accept it on ideological grounds . 
  so you 're actually saying that representative democracy is illegitimate ? 
  i regret this whole conversation now . 
  it 's always a waste of time to try to discuss with an extremist . 
  but i can vote for a representative for parliament . 
  you 're using a completely made up definition that only recognises direct democracy as legitimate . 
  so you 're saying states where federal referenda are illegal but that do have democratic elections do not have a demos ? 
  that 's insane . 
  but i can vote on europe-wide referenda , or could if they existed . 
  how do you not see that ? 
  you can also not vote on referenda in yorkshire and are still part of the uk demos and can vote on uk wide referenda .
