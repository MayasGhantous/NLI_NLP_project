  i remember reading that latvia has the most negative attitude towards refugees in all of europe . 
  is that not the case ? 
  estonia ( and latvia ) are in schengen . 
  if they wanted french or german terrorists could drive there now . 
  no need for home-grown minorities . 
  it 's simply about media perception . 
  they do n't want any attacks in countries oppressive to muslims because they want other countries to think it works and adopt the same policies so more people are radicalised by being excluded from society . 
   one could claim that our discussions and our '' fear agenda '' has led to the fact that there are no muslim or right wing terror acts in our country . 
  oh come on . 
  the only reason there are n't any attacks in eastern european countries is because they are n't seen as big and public enough targets . 
  yeah retaliation totally worked after 9/11 . 
  did n't make everything worse at all ... 
  technically the anthem has n't got any lyrics but the original song does and this is an accurate translation . 
  they are beautiful lyrics but i think they work a bit better in german . 
  there 's something archaic and titanic about them in that language . 
  well that did n't work out , did it ? 
  a knock-off founded 22 years before the real thing ? 
  both of those sound like awesome mvies . 
  fucking great observation . 
  it really does . 
  just need to flip up florida to cover england and wales and cut off a bit of new england to cover benelux and the rhineland . 
  well , since you can drive more directly and do n't have to follow the mediterranean coast i 'd argue it 's not quite comparable in terms of driving time . 
  let 's fucking hope so . 
  the southern parts of scandinavia ( denmark , southern and middle sweden , southern norway ) are n't really that different from continental european temperatures ( or northern east coast/new england i guess ? ) . 
  it 's really only northern sweden and northern norway where you 'll get the clich\u00e9 metres of snow and moose and reindeer . 
  they 'll just build a dome over the whole island with all the aluminium they refine and then heat it with geothermic heat . 
  why are they even talking about this ? 
  i 'm so sick of these american kids suddenly interested in inner-european news . 
  but only if they think they can push their agenda . 
  it is inevitable though . 
  last time it took 6 years of war and the death of millions but democracy came back strengthened . 
  well lucky this sub does n't dictate german interior policy then . 
  or maybe they 're just the most beautiful . 
  but you 're perfectly allowed to promote islam in germany ? 
  just not islamism . 
  a huge chemical company that has its main facility there . 
  they have a bit of an explosion problem . 
  prove what ? 
  here are two recent examples of using the same method of emphasis from my recent comment history . 
  do you really want to argue that i thought all these words were acronyms ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/5h6m4g/hello_one_quick_word_for_people_from_the_uk_who/daxzkgt/?st=iwtuqgw7&amp;sh=a7f02736 https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5egbip/brexit_minister_david_davis_accused_of_having_no/dace24m/?st=iwtuuxhm&amp;sh=1672c713, 
  do you mean my and ? 
  that 's called emphasis . 
  and misspelling shakespeare . 
  i 'll leave it here , i think every reader can come to their own conclusions . 
   good chap  good sir you 're not helping your cause here . 
  no brit i know would speak like that even as a joke . 
  oh come on . 
  the lack of definite articles in your texts is a typical sign of a native speaker of a slavic language . 
   argument makes zero sense . 
  as does your english . 
  unlike yours their english is pitch perfect . 
  wow , you actually believe you have the upper hand , do n't you . 
  amazing . 
  btw , nigel standing awkwardly in an elevator with trump are not `` talks underway '' . 
  i would be genuinely surprised if trump even remembered farage 's name . 
  i meant that the area is on reddit quite regularly thanks to that . . 
  are the yearly basf explosions not enough ?

  it never claimed to provide stability for non-members after all . 
  something the uk will find out soon . 
  i 've also annotated those incidents that were merely fishing conflicts with a little fish emoji . 
  do you really expect the answer to a populist vote to not be populist ? 
  i do n't know . 
  i 've lived in freiburg for almost 10 years and all my female friends would walk home alone from parties all the time . 
  the only time i ever heard of something happening ( except for loads of stolen bicycles ) was a male friend of a friend being mugged . 
  that 's one incident in 10 years . 
  of course it 's now probably still as safe or unsafe as it ever was but i blame nobody if their individual perception means they do n't do that anymore . 
   it kind of sends a mixed message why ? 
  the rhetoric against us europeans was very clear . 
  make no mistake , the message has been received loud and clear and it will influence the negotiations because those politicians have electorates to consider , too . 
  so as an early medieval archaeologist i 'd love to here what your definition of this `` shorter period '' is and why it still deserves the name `` dark ages . '', 
  wow , that comment section !, 
   technically the roman empire stole half of the eu at some point . 
  ftfy, 
  so , war . 
  so you have no problem with a foreign power interferring in your country 's elections ? 
  really ? 
   ultimately the electorate decided the ability to work abroad was n't worth the other terms of eu membership only they did n't because , as i said in my original comment , this was n't about eu membership . 
  it was about deprived communities being desperate to be heard by westminster . 
  that the referendum was the first chance they had where their voices were n't being stifled by the fptp system is almost a coincidence . 
  that guy is me and no , if you reread what i said i did n't expect you to think of me . 
  what i did say is that it 's a shame that i 'm collateral damage in a vote that at heart was n't even about the eu but about decades of westminster ignoring the country outside london . 
  i 'm not even too put out by all of this . 
  i 'm much more angry on behalf of my british friends who have lost 26/28ths of the amount of countries they can work visa free . 
  for me it 's only 1/28th , albeit a major player in my field , which is where my 15-20 % number comes from . 
  we 'll see about that . 
  and i 'm sure you know many hardworking viking age archaeologists whose jobs i would have stolen . 
  were you also pleasantly surprised by his claim that it 's all a jewish conspiracy ? 
  well for one it would open up your horizon and not make you accuse others of `` narcicism '' for living in the modern , international world . 
  i take it you 've never lived abroad then . 
  yeah i 'm aware of that but it 's hard not to feel bitter when i lost about 15-20 % of my worldwide employment opportunities because of a vote that was n't even about what it was supposedly about and that i had no influence over whatsoever . 
  [ we 're working on it ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/f1b3e52e-99b0-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae ), 
   i know it does n't make sense , like most of the things on this map . 
  shhh , do n't think too hard about it and it 'll be ok ... yeah it is confusing but the christkind ( i.e. 
  `` christ child '' = baby jesus ) is simultaneously a baby and a ( female ) angel depending on the situation . 
  an exercise in cognitive dissonance a bit like the holy trinity that is simultaneously one and three entities . 
  so what struck me most here ( and i 'm sure it 's the same for many non-brit europeans here ) is that almost all the complaints were about things that had nothing to do with us but with westminster . 
  and yet we 're the boogeymen that need to be punished . 
  under corbyn they do .
