  but they also only have a chance at getting elected under a leader who does n't give a fuck about the poor . 
  so it 's a bit of a moot question . 
  postfactual much ? 
    it ca n't get any worse for us     something that remainers on / r/unitedkingdom do n't seem to understand . 
  we do understand that that 's their reasoning . 
  would be hard no to when all the media has n't talked about anthing else for the last half year . 
  what we do n't understand is why they make us other europeans the scapegoat and are n't angry at their own government instead . 
  on the contrary , the tories , those responsible for their plight , are being voted in with higher and higher margins . 
  how many people are there even with an eu migrant background that are allowed to vote ? 
  thanks to fom we do n't need to take citizenship after all so i bet the amount is vanishingly small . 
  try taking on the 13 yule lads , their witch mother gr\u00fdla and their child-eating monster cat . 
  good luck . 
   and globalization taught you rightly that babies are incapable of such things . 
  well [ this is the german baby jesus ] ( http://bilder.augsburger-allgemeine.de/img/incoming/crop27922912/2377218199-ctopteaser/nuernberger-christkind.jpg ) that brings the gifts . 
  she is quite capable of carying presents i 'm sure . 
  i know it does n't make sense , like most of the things on this map . 
  someone who grew up in a socialist country was in a socialist organisation ? 
  colour me shocked !, 
  btw , both the leaders of the parties you admire so much in poland and hungary got their political starts in socialist parties . 
  are kaczynski and orban socialists , too ? 
  * only for definitions of leftism that would classify almost all european conservative parties as `` leftist '', 
  why ? 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  it has . 
  there 's a reason there 's basically no leftist governments in europe anymore . 
  that was reciprocal . 
  uhm , yeah . 
  could be , could be svalbard . 
  i 'm just very careful with medieval geography because it 's almost never straightforward . 
  we would have brought beer !, 
  did n't we mention that ? 
  and there 's the u-turn . 
   . . just wanted to let you guys know , if you know people and want to get in , you should use them . 
  i do n't have anyone so i 'll pass . 
   so i live in brussels , and hangout with some young people who have parents or other relatives in the eu admin . 
  checks out, 
   celtic monks may have seasonally inhabited iceland up to the time when norse settlement began . 
  there 's no archaelogical evidence for it , but the literary evidence is quite compelling . 
  i would n't say compelling . 
  a small passage in \u00cdslendingab\u00f3k and a copy of that in landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k is n't that much . 
  personally i do believe it 's likely but i 'm not 100 % convinced . 
  i 'm not really convinced by kristj\u00e1n ahronson 's cave excavations either . 
  and just in time , too . 
  think tony blair . 
  edit : so apparently the downvoters disagree that the direction the spd has taken since schr\u00f6der is very similar to that of labour under the blairites ? 
  care to elaborate why ? 
   mate , i happen to reside in eu . 
  in the actual eu or the uk ? 
  because you certainly sound like you get all your information from the british press ... 
  which is why we send back those that do not have a right to stay . 
  if the captain has steered your ship into a storm unnecessarily you do n't mutiny while he 's trying to keep the ship afloat . 
  you throw him in the brig after the storm has calmed . 
  not that i agree with the rise of the populist right but that 's the thinking i bet . 
  well i guess that 's denmark 's problem . 
  germany has sent back 95 % . 
  so do n't project you government 's policies on us . 
  we 're already sending back planeloads of afghans every day . 
  total peace will not be needed in syria , just comparable levels to afghanistan . 
  we 're not interested in immigration either . 
  we just have a legal obligation to hold up human rights that almost every other western country seems to have forgotten . 
  considering he has probably come straight out of a sauna it probably takes a while for his body to cool down to dangerous levels . 
  have you never taken a dip in the snow after a sauna session ? 
  you do n't feel cold at all for quite a while . 
  huh ? 
  pforzheim has an spd mayor and the previous one was fdp ? 
  so what is it with vorarlberg ? 
  that the cities would vote vdb and the rural areas poor man 's trump was clear ( it was the same with the real orange utan and with brexit ) but why this outlier ? 
  well the water is n't frozen below the surface which by default makes it a comfortable 0 \u00b0 or warmer ... 
  it 's really napoleon iii who we have to thank for things like the al\u00e9sia excavations , though . 
  i did n't know ol' bonaparte had an interest as well . 
  seriously ? 
  edit : why is this being downvoted ? 
  napoleon made my native franconia part of the kingdom of bavaria to which it did n't belong , which resulted in a loss of movable heritage that has n't been recovered to this day ( such as diverse pieces by d\u00fcrer and the bamberg cathedral treasure ) . 
  the napoleonic reforms in many parts of germany also resulted in the dissolution of many monasteries and the selling-off of their art and libraries , a blow to our knowledge of medieval culture we will never recover from . 
  at least i do n't use such language . 
  whether i should tell you i 'll never reference xkcd again and then break that promise or not . 
  does n't matter , though , i was just seeing how far i could take this conversation while saying nothing really . 
  i guess it 's not the comment itself but the fact it 's coming from a well-known jingoistic nationalist on this sub . 
  someone who has posted things like :  [ europe of nations is not what the eussr want to achieve . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5fdqaw/fillons_eu_vision_france_leading_a_europe_of/dajgzm1/?context=3&amp;st=iwca91s1&amp;sh=7eef3b9d ) or  [ if there 's one things continentals never learn about britian , it 's never underestimate us when we seem to be on our knees . 
  napoleon did it , hitler did it , juncker is attempting to do it . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5etui3/boris_johnson_is_a_clown_who_has_united_the_eu/daf4j1q/?st=iwcab02v&amp;sh=ee39d79f ) or  [ on the eu  [ does n't creating an army and hoping to expand their borders and influence throughout europe sound very nazi/soviet to you ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5cpzi6/marine_le_pen_trump_win_boosts_my_chances/d9yqds1/?st=iwcaj6su&amp;sh=00152184 ) i think you 'll agree that puts the comment into another context . . 
  fair point . 
  i do n't know . 
  what does game theory say how i should act ? 
  are you going to follow me around to check ? 
  i probably do n't !, 
  care to make me one of today 's lucky 10,000 ? 
  indeed . 
  and i 'd argue that that makes it prone to exploitation as any holes can only be patched after the fact . 
  the thing about the law we have here is that it is n't strict at all , though . 
  whenever i see american rulings it seems like people can go throuh loopholes and get deals much easier . 
  in germany the judge has a mandate to respect the spirit of the law and not necessarily its letter . 
  so the childish `` i 'm not technically touching you '' defense does n't work as well . 
  why ? 
  is there something that makes it objectively better ? 
  it 's about the origin of the law currently in effect . 
  not about the origins of previously-used systems . 
  those were 15 years ago .
