  while your hate for eastern europeans and that other chap 's hate for the french seemed to be the real deal . 
  why ? 
  are we known to hate our neighbours ? 
  mostly column american business interests , though, 
  what is it with nrw people hating our neighbours ? 
  only recently i had a discussion with someone [ adamant that germans do n't like the french ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/6giuea/american_here_why_do_europeans_hate_the_french/diqzoee/?st=j414bv41&amp;sh=185bbac4 ) . 
  seldom have i heard anything more absurd . 
  is your state really that insular ? 
  `` there are tons of countries that have just as many opt-outs as we have '' . 
  any brexiter ever . 
  yeah , right, 
  they must have brought in loads more money in tourism by now than they cost . 
  just shows that the kini was thinking of his subjects ' long-term future . 
  just make it a four-day feast and bank holidays from the 5th to the 9th already . 
  now that would be european . 
   the new generation were raised with a totally different mind how do you not see that the basic law and holocaust denial laws foster that democratic mindset ? 
  it boggles the mind . 
  * wehret den anf\u00e4ngen * ( beware of the first signs/beginnings [ of fascism ] ) has been our unofficial motto for a long time . 
  and who are pastors ' daughters, 
  i mean the story is absolutely the one i heard as well . 
  just not set in the netherlands, 
  because president for life donald the first has decreed that an annexation by russia is what will make america great again ? 
  tbf 2016 was not a good year for making a positive argument for progressivism . 
  thanks to trump and the right-wing populists on the continent there were lots of cries of * political correctness is killing us !, 
  * and people genuinely and unironically calling themselves * anti-progressivists * ( for some reason they did n't want to use the more accurate term * regressives * ? ) . 
  not saying that a more positive remain campaign was n't sorely needed , i 'm just not quite sure whether it would have been enough in that year 's peculiar social climate . 
  there were definitely those that said `` the eu is a sinking ship we are tied to '' . 
  strangely enough those people do n't pipe up as much anymore . 
  everybody wore wooden clogs as a work shoe in the middle ages and early modern era from ireland to russia and from scandinavia to italy . 
  in the 18th century that would still be the case over large parts or europe . 
  yeah , i 'm so happy that it 's the sun wot did n't win it . 
  still there is dire need for a leveson 2 or at least follow-through on the first one 's recommendations . 
  considering john cleese is a brexiter i do n't begrudge them the loss of income . 
  i 'm sure it 'll do enemies a load of good to know how many shots the rifle they 're being shot at with has shot over its lifetime . 
  i thought you were joking but the hk 433 has a shot counter that will be readable via bluetooth or similar ... 
  [ now it does ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ax5en1.jpg ), 
  for those of you lucky enough to live in the arte region ( or who speak french or german ) there is an episode of that channel 's * les villages de france * / * frankreichs mythische orte * [ about kaysersberg ] ( http://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/044992-024-a/villages-de-france ), 
  you people ca n't leave alone a single fucking thread !, 
  no offense but i 've always thought that this is one of the ugliest buildings around . 
  like someone took a giant blowtorch to a perfectly good oversized gothic cathedral and partially melted it like a psychopathic little brother does with his sister 's barbie doll . 
  oh god , i love him for that . 
  you 'll notice that i highlighted `` working conditions '' and not `` pay '' . 
   working conditions you ( and they ) might not have followed the news on the state of the nhs recently . 
  britain is open for business , eh ? 
  i think [ this kind of thing ] ( https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/76850000/jpg/_76850113_tv023449241.jpg ) explains that as well . 
  metaphors , what are they ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they * want * one . 
  i 'm equally sure they wo n't * pursue * one . 
  except corbyn of course , he does n't want soft brexit . 
   there motivation is nationalism . 
  that does n't mean fascism . 
  british politics used to be able policies that aimed to improve the wealth of the nation for everyone who lived there . 
  in the last 20 years so much of the narrative has been dominated by issues of multiculturalism , meanwhile the economy has mostly been good but none of the spoils have been push down to those communities that were previous dependent on nationalised industry . 
  largest wealth divide of any european nation . 
  and what of that is our fault ? 
  it 's incredibly unfair that i lose my right to live and work in your country just because you ca n't reign in your runaway tabloid press . 
  not to mention that even g20 meetings with popular leaders are protested heavily with riots breaking out at every single one . 
  this time it will be mayhem . 
   yeah but the german govt is vw 's second largest shareholder no it is n't . 
  a state is . 
  is it about them having stolen your flag and trying to disguise it by sticking a sticker on it ? 
  honestly i expect it more to go [ like this ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ecwx7dl0c ), 
  yup , and that same fptp system is also responsible for the low turnout and high partisanship and division in the uk . 
  fptp is an obsolete and dangerous concept and it needs to die . 
  a car crash where the driver also experiences it in slow motion and thus has plenty of time to steer the car away from the wall , yet she does n't for fear of appearing weak and losing her job as a driver . 
  sometimes it just feels good to see these people lose , even if it does n't mean you gain anything from it . 
  especially after 2016 it 's very cathartic to see may humiliated . 
  one can only hope . 
  their education does n't extend to recognising national flags either it seems ... 
  general electric election . 
  every tory voter gets a ge appliances from may . 
  i do n't think the eu can stipulate how member countries decide on internal matters . 
  but i 'm sure other aspects of article 50 will be reformed and clarified when all this is over . 
  nz had the good sense to get rid of fptp . 
  no idea why canada is not succumbing to the system 's huge flaws , though . 
  newcastle was basically 50/50 . 
  this indicates that although nobody was talking about brexit in the campaigns it 's still the deciding factor . 
  actually sunderland is a swing towards the tories , while newcastle is a smaller swing towards labour than expected . 
  well shit . 
  newcastle and sunderland results , while obvs going to labour showed less of a swing towards labour as the exit polls . 
  if this is a nationwide trend exit polls might underestimate the tories and they might get their majority ... 
  really , you mention bl\u00fcmchen and do n't go for her most famous and annoying song ? 
  [ bl\u00fcmchen - boomerang ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=r5qjvumarlc ), 
   if she has even an ounce of honor well there 's your problem . 
  the atrocious german accent did n't tip you off ? 
  i take it you 're from there then ? 
  do n't get me wrong , colchester is a fascinating place not only the early roman period but also before , when it is by far the most continental of english iron age sites.even compared to hillforts such as maiden castle it looks more like a gaulish * oppidum * than an english hillfort . 
  well it says * major * roman roads and while colchester was very important especially in the early empire , i guess stane street was n't considered major . 
  you do have a point , though , the choice of roads and stops in britannia seems arbitrary ( as it does elsewhere as well ) . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/roman_roads_in_britannia.svg/2000px-roman_roads_in_britannia.svg.png ) the orange line basically follows part of watling street , ermine street and only a small part of dere street before veering away to carlisle , hardly one of the three most important towns in britain , while ignoring such important places as caerleon or chester ( both legionary fortresses ) . 
  we can go on if necessary : [ captain jack - captain jack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8fgyxizmau ) [ scooter - how much is the fish ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbb3igrhtqa ) [ scooter - hyper hyper ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7twnmhe948a ), 
  it 's all about what you heard around you in your formative years i guess . 
  so you would n't consider [ dragostea din tei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4xc3dxde5i ) eurodance just because it came out in 2004 ? 
  it 's a transparent ploy to privatise the autobahn system 2 . 
  it will probably cost more to implement than the revenue it will bring in 3 . 
  i refuse on principle to pay to use roads in my own country . 
  they 've been built and maintained with my taxes and now i should pay to use them ? 
  this is a populist political maneuvre by the csu to demonstrate to their bavarian voters that they 're relevant on a federal level . 
  nobody wants it , including the cdu but dobrindt stubbornly goes ahead .
