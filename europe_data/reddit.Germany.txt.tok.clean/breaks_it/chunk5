  my hope is that whatever happens ( and i do n't think it 'll be as bad as wwii ) will strengthen democracy again , not destroy it permanently . 
  funnily enough we have access to your media but you do n't have access to most of ours ( unless you speak ca . 
  20 languages ) . 
  which means that we have the inside and tr outside perspective . 
  you however ... 
  or at least a cataclysmic event out of which democracy will emerge with new safeguards . 
  that 's how it was last time . 
  i do n't doubt they exist or that they 're buried at that airport even . 
  but that article has n't convinced me that they 've found them . 
  yeah but the burmese spitfires did n't turn out to be real either ... 
  they 're not unearthed yet . 
  ( or indeed , i 'd argue , confirmed found ) . 
  yeah , i 'm still sceptical  official efforts to find the missing 72 warplanes started in 2015 and tests were conducted with metal detectors . 
  the machines determined the whereabouts of the warplanes , but bureaucracy hindered officials from unearthing the planes . 
  so all they have so far is that they know that there is a large amount of metal in the ground . 
  since i guess it 's all concreted over and resistivity is therefore out i 'd like to see some sort of georadar or geomagnetics survey before i agree that it 's anything significant . 
  ( it 's funny this is downvoted . 
  i guess some people are with fox mulder 's office poster on that one . 
  it was the same when i gave my opinion as an archaeologist on that ridiculous nazi gold train in poland ), 
  pretty sure they 're not into fraternit\u00e9 either ... 
  if you want the tesla fan boy pespective go to / r/technology  would n't want to give tesla an advantage over german brands , would we ... not saying autopilot is perfect , it still needs a lot of work , especially for individual countries with different road markings and signs . 
   but , how could you not advertise such a revolutionary system ? 
   it 's like asking audi not to advertise 4 wheel drive because it might make people abuse it and drive their sedans off road ... 
  ironically [ this ] ( https://next-geebee.ft.com/image/v1/images/raw/http%3a%2f%2fcom.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2ff6f7bf1c-8edc-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78?source=next&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;width=700 ) is the only affected tenant mentioned in the article . 
  pamela schobess is obviously from a minority population !, 
   the prime minister 's demand that britain controls its borders i hate this newspeak so much . 
  britain has always had control over its borders . 
  border control and immigration are two totally different things . 
  hear hear !, 
  rather, 
  indeed . 
  that 's why i specifically said `` the last big one '' ... 
  curiously enough germany buys almost no military equipment from the us . 
  i struggle to think what the last big one was : starfighter ? 
  the m113 ? 
  probably the world 's sixth-largest arms exporter : germany ? 
  you ca n't be serious ? 
   someone smart enough to become a professor could easily make 2 to 5 times that in private r&d ( at least in stem ) . 
  is n't that the case in every country ? 
  he was dutch after all . 
  if any country needs to look bigger than it is ... 
  but it qualifies them for being called deluded !, 
  the obvious joke is that he is deluded and probably thinks finns are inferior for not speaking a scandinavian language . 
  ( sorry but i really hate varg . 
  fantoft , never forget ) . 
  yeah , calling the literal homicidal maniac and arsonist `` deluded '' is a `` nice ad hominem , mate '' , mate !, 
  and cameron never said ww iii . 
  he only said that the eu was founded to prevent war and that the probability of conflict rises should it fail . 
  that 's it . 
  of course the british press being what it is immediately made ww iii out of it . 
  without the press ' constant exaggerations ( `` dodgy deal '' anyone ? ), 
  this could have been a fact-based debate that would have led to some sensible eu reforms . 
   `` not fucking our economy then we 'll try and appease the headbangers '' please tell me he used these exact words !, 
  ( i know he has n't of course , otherwise the dm and express would have exploded already ), 
  oh come on . 
  and they say us germans are pedants !, 
  indeed they are n't . 
  [ we 're paying for them after all ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimer-krieg-deutschland-zahlt-millionen-fuer-us-militaer-1.1820318 ) . 
  about 1 billion $ of german taxpayer money between 2003 and 2012 . 
  yes ? 
  what exactly are you arguing against ? 
  all / u/23powerz was saying is that if he was guilty ( and let 's be honest , he almost certainly was ) , then him killing himself could be rationalised in his mind . 
  well considering they found a kg of explosives at his place and he subsequently ran away it 's a pretty open-and-shut case . 
  ( unless you really hate niedersachsen ), 
  pretty sure they 're the kind of person that does n't bother voting in eu elections and then cries on the internet that it 's undemocratic . 
   now how long gone do i have to wait on the paid shills of the eu to get in here ? 
  i wonder what usernames will pop up ... 
  but this is so deliciously deluded i kinda want to answer something that reinforces their delusions ... 
  so when did the `` far left '' attack a police station and try to free a detainee ? 
  this only says that the uk has n't left yet and that consequently nothing has changed . 
  it says literally nothing about what rights eu nationals will have in the uk in the future . 
  that 's why i made sure to write my country 's name into my flair as well . 
  when it comes to those of my identities that are tied to geography i 'm a franconian first , southern german second , german third , bavarian fourth . 
  ( european is outside this spectrum ), 
  so how in your mind did they get a job without a visa ? 
  your right to work has to be proven in the application process . 
  illegal immigrants work illegally and they wo n't show up in those figures . 
   these are people who will be dealing with materials that disclose negotiation tactics they 're academic advisers , not negotiators and they have advised to government on brexit-related matters before . 
  they wo n't have access to sensitive materials . 
   so the government knows where to start to crack down on people working illegally in the country . 
  banning foreign academics and how would that work given that the people represented by thesr figures are by definition working legally ? 
  then i hope that after brexit they bring each and every tabloid and leave campaigner to court . 
  the two complemented each other quite well . 
  [ this one ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515068/why-the-government-believes-that-voting-to-remain-in-the-european-union-is-the-best-decision-for-the-uk.pdf ) [ pdf warning ] as you can see it was sent by the government in support of their position , not the remain campaign . 
  it also does n't contain any untruths so the person above is simply a sore winner . 
  i doubt it since i 'm pretty sure that only works for individual people not organisations . 
  but if it was possible the comission 's [ own list of lies in the british press ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) would probably be enough to sue murdoch into bankruptcy . 
  yes, 
  actually , since german unification was always about the german-speaking areas and the lost territories do n't have a majority german-speaking population anymore they kinda do n't count anyway ... 
  or just more lighthearted pan-european content in general . 
  [ that native language tower of babel thread a few days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54jrk3/today_is_the_european_day_of_languages_lets_make/?st=itu01u8r&amp;sh=ee0a5cba ) was the most fun i 've had on reddit in a long time . 
  ( thanks / u/badblueboy146 for starting it ) . 
  and can i just say : i 'm all for mexico joining the eu but did you have to stick them in the north atlantic ? 
  you obliterated the faroes !, 
  i think they 'd prefer the climate in the mediterranean , too . 
   the 'em ergency brake ' that eea members get is almost good enough i think , but she needs just a little more if the press had n't stabbed cameron in the back with the `` dodgy deal '' myth his renogotiation would have been enough . 
  i 'm just afraid that this will happen again with whatever emergency brakes may will achieve . 
  and so is she , probably . 
   i do n't worry that we 'll leave the single market . 
  not even the tories are stupid enough to invite a 2008-level , uk-localised recession when their entire political platform is built on economic growth and stability .
