  probably not most but i would n't be surprised if a large percentage had . 
  if they 're anything like the leaders of their campaigns leave voters are not above massive hypocrisy . 
  well saying it 's bizarre at least implies that you do n't think they are legitimate feeling . 
  which i guess is fair enough ( though it 's only 52 % + x of you ) . 
  but why do you deny us the legitimacy of those feelings ? 
  europe is more than a political union . 
  it 's a symbol of hope that we can overcome the wars and the animosity that has plagued our continent for so long, 
  i can kinda understand how it will upset someone if they 're being told `` fuck you , we do n't want to be in a union with you . 
  oh , but i 'll take a passport , thank you very much . '', 
  if they supported remain : good for them . 
  they have a right to reduce the personal impact of a decision they do n't agree with . 
  if they supported leave : fucking hypocrites . 
  taking away rights from others while keeping them yourself . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ( via / u/marktplatz ), 
   when germany said it would take all refugees or so about a year ag that never happened and you know it . 
  hmm , let me see : [ nigel farage a month ago ? 
  ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/703541/nigel-farage-ukip-immigration-brexit-vote-donald-trump-jackson-mississippi-us-president ), 
  51.9 % of you . 
   dear uk , please read the treaty of lisbon . 
  sch\u00e4uble can even explain it in english if need be . 
  same in germany . 
  i would love for the institutions of an eventual eu army to be named after and modelled on the roman army !, 
  would n't that be paris ? 
  you have our ( germany 's ) axe , too . 
  i doubt any party here ( except afd ) are against it . 
  wow , do you actually believe this is a significant factor in todays world ? 
  then why is the uk replacing its workforce with polish people who do n't speak english according to your tabloids ? 
  depends on your definition . 
  \u00f6 here , you dropped that . 
  at the point that islam came about the difference between germans and italians was somewhat blurred ... edit : whoever is downvoting me does not seem to realise that [ the ostrogothic kingdom ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrogothic_kingdom ) had only ended less than 20 years before muhammad was born . 
  you 're not wrong in a way . 
  they thought it was an invitation but it was n't . 
  i 'd expect a political comment piece to make that distinction . 
  vowels , not l 's !, 
   merkel 's unqualified invitation to syrian refugees to come to germany last year it ca n't be good political analysis if they fall for that meme . 
  talk about unelectable . 
  a csu candidate will never be able to win chancellorship . 
  baron ~ ~ dr. ~ ~ lying mclieface might have had a chance but fortunately he fell over his plagiarism just in time . 
  it wo n't come to this because seehofer is not going to be a candidate . 
   i 'm not sure how merkel got a reputation as a paragon of principle well she has n't . 
  that 's only outside of germany , where all they see is the refugee thing . 
  in the country she is mostly known for doing nothing and then deciding at the last moment what her principles are depending on what it seems the electorate want . 
  but is this about the freedom of other eu citizens moving to france and vice versa ? 
  is lepen crying about `` the polish taking our jobs '' like the uk does ? 
  or is it rather about non-eu migration ? 
   the eu system is terrible for our fishermen . 
  you say that but where 's the evidence ? 
  what have we established so far ? 
  under the cfp national governments can give out quotas as they see fit . 
  in the uk the government has either given them out to other european fishermen or to british fishermen who then sold them on . 
  how is any of that the eu 's fault ? 
  [ this might be an enlightening read . 
  ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/griffin-carpenter/eu-common-fisheries-policy-has-helped-not-harmed-uk-fisheries-0 )  the uk industry 's gross profit margin has increased from a healthy 15 % in 2008 to 35 % in 2014 and now stands at $ 367 million , the highest in the eu, 
  seriously , is there even another eu country where fom is a big deal in daily politics ? 
  or even talked about at all ? 
  wow this thread is hilarious . 
  paranoid right wingers panicking about an article in the apotheken umschau . 
  the fucking apotheken umschau !, 
  ex ... act . . ly . 
  so once again we see a uk government failure blamed on the eu . 
  in order for other european companies to buy them british fishermen have to sell them . 
  if sovereignty over money were such an important goal they should n't have done that , i guess ? 
  transformers <  art does not compute . 
  [ he is n't anyway at the moment ] ( https://twitter.com/marabales/status/746281001177997313 ), 
  then why did n't your government sell more permits to british fishermen ? 
  an actual german ( i.e. 
  born and bred in germany , with a horrible geran accent , not just of german descent ) was one of the most influential foreign secretaries of the us , too . 
  hey , just like berlin !, 
  but would n't that mean germany is profiting once again from the southern european countries ? 
  with our society slowly dying of old age it woud be the young of southern europe that would pay into that ... 
   no one in their right mind yeah , that 's exactly the probem with trump . 
   fortunately we now have a prime minister who has an understanding of diplomacy . 
  who appointed a foreign secretary who once said `` the only reason i would n't visit some parts of new york is the real risk of meeting donald trump . '', 
  so ... yeah ... there 's that ... 
  that will be the motto of the eu negotiation team ... 
   has more history in it 's little pinky than most of the eu countries put together what ? 
  but now that bake-off has been ruined even baking wo n't help you anymore . 
  they said that about this spring as well ... 
  the anglosphere mostly uses exclusively english-speaking media as a source . 
  so they have the uk and the us perspective but only a very basic insight into the german one . 
  because that 's the stereotyical german accent and he 's intentionally speaking in that . 
  ex-mayor . 
  but yeah , in general j\u00f3n gnarr 's mayorship worked out really well . 
   what lies did the remain ** campaign ** say ? 
  highlighted that for you . 
  just to make this clear : i am not in any way rooting for one , the person above me is as it would confirm their worldview . 
  but you do n't have much to worry about . 
  munich police are good at what they do and security is heightened this year . 
  have fun . 
  going to quote myself :  it makes money to sustain itself and continue to provide it 's service , not to pay out to shareholders . 
  how long do you think we can keep this up before we get banned ? 
  it makes money to sustain itself and continue to provide it 's service , not to pay out to shareholders . 
  [ yeah , about that  ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_guardian )  the scott trust became a limited company in 2008 , with a constitution to maintain the same protections for the guardian . 
  profits are reinvested in journalism rather than to the benefit of an owner or shareholders, 
  yeah , because napoleon , bl\u00fccher , tilly , wallenstein , caesar were so bad at it . 
  oh fuck you . 
  gleefully rooting for a terror attack . 
  yes . 
  there are exceptions though , such as for other eu countries ( sorry ! ), 
  or if renouncing your other citizenship constituted undue hardship ( which is true for the us for example because you have to pay thousands of dollars to renounce it ) .
