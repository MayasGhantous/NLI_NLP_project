it 's at least as ample as it is unambiguous , let me tell you that !, 
  fight to the death ? 
  i have unambiguous evidence that kaspar42 is a ferret . 
  could you eli5 why spain is nervous about scottish independence ? 
  good point , cheers . 
  that 's odd . 
  it was my understanding that over the past * [ 10 years income inequalities have been rising in germany . 
  while the living standards of the poorest households have stagnated , those of the richest have strongly increased . 
  the income inequalities are sharply increasing in germany since the turn of the millennium ] ( http://inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article114 ) * . 
  why does this index show social justice rising in germany ? 
  i fully agree . 
  that 's why i said they 're shit * compared to the original version * . 
   and what would you achieve with this , if i may ask ? 
  i experience the original actors ' performance . 
  their emotion , their nuance , their inflection , their timing and a million subtleties that inform a character but get lost in dubbing . 
  i also really like getting a feeling of another culture 's language and way of speaking . 
  watching a chinese film in chinese opens you up to a very different experience compared to watching it dubbed . 
  language is not only about information transfer through words you understand , it also communicates culture , character and emotion - much of which can be understood even if you do n't understand the language . 
  with subtitles to fill the gap in understanding i think one is far better off than with watching a dub . 
  and i disagree with you here - to me subtitles do n't distract me from the imagery nearly as much as you claim . 
  maybe it 's a matter of practice . 
  i know too well what you mean . 
  so much so actually that over the course of the last five years i 've come to a state where 95 % of my friends are non-germans ( i live in berlin where there 's a lot of international people ) . 
  i just ended up spending more and more time with them over the long haul . 
  they would n't need dubbing if they 'd been watching undubbed movies their entire lives . 
   i do n't know what the best way to transition * out * of dubbing would be so that your grandparents would n't be negatively affected but we 'd still have the benefits of a media landscape without dubbing but i think it would be worth exploring . 
  i 'd say just stop feeling like a pretentious fuck . 
   there 's no need to . 
  i think it 's perfectly legitimate to avoid watching a dubbed film if you do n't enjoy it . 
  just think about it . 
  instead of watching the ** actual movie ** as it was intended to be viewed by the filmmakers ; with the real actors and their performances in it - you 're watching some frankenstein-mash up between the real actor 's performance on the visual side and some other guy in a booth talking over his performance . 
  that other guy is not on set , has never talked to the director , is n't interacting with anyone who 's really in the film and is attached to the entire film for usually only a day or a few days of recording sessions . 
  i 'm not saying voice actors are doing a bad job , i 'm saying there 's simply no chance to come as close to the authenticity , emotion and impact of the original actors ' performance in a dub . 
  it 's like going to the louvre and looking at the mona lisa through an instagram filter - it 's a gross distortion of the original piece . 
  there 's no * option * , movies on tv and in 95 % of all cinemas are dubbed , period . 
  that 's no * option * , it 's ** imposing ** a version of lower quality on people . 
  ideally of course you 'd have the option to choose audio and subtitle tracks wherever you watch media but unfortunately that 's not the case . 
  * `` once you stop learning , you start dying . 
  '' * - albert einstein, 
  if they watched english movies with subtitles long enough they 'd learn quite a bit of english fairly quickly . 
  there is but they 're still shit compared to the original version . 
  i only go to original version screenings . 
  if a movie is n't shown in the original language in a theatre nearby i 'm waiting for the blu-ray release - no matter how badly i want to see the film . 
  i 'm german and since i started watching original language versions around ten years ago i 've become more and more intolerant of dubs to the point where i 'd now rather not see a movie at all than watch it dubbed . 
  germany 's are among the highest quality dubs in the world ** and they 're shit ** compared to the original version !, 
  even if a film is in a language i do n't understand a single word of , i 'll take subtitles instead of a dub any day !,

  :(  but retailers are having trouble shifting the huge amount of minke meat in supermarkets , as norwegians show little appetite for whale . 
   some is exported to japan , which was ordered to end its own whale hunts in the antarctic by the un earlier this year . 
  oh come on ... 
  i 'm german myself and yes , that 's kind of what i feel like . 
  what if not the population size of a country should in your opinion define the influence a country should have in a democratic parliament like the eu ?

  i voted for the ** [ 100 % tempelhof ] ( http://www.thf100.de/start.html ) ** initiative and against the abgeordnetenhaus plans .

  the bundesregierung is the german federal government . 
  the bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische bildung ( bpb ) is :  the federal agency for civic education , face ( german : bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische bildung , bpb ) is a german federal government agency responsible for promoting civic education . 
  it is subordinated to the federal ministry of the interior . 
   ( ... )  its task is now to promote understanding of political issues , strengthen awareness for democracy and willingness to participate in political processes amongst the citizen .

  * nobody 's perfect * is a common english saying that people also use just like that in germany . 
  nobody says * niemand ist perfekt * but it 's not unusual at all for a german to simply say * nobody 's perfect . 
  * in english in the middle of a german conversation if it 's appropriate to the context .

  i read youtube comments . 
  this was the first one :  this is what all european western nations should do instead of importing millions of muslims to breed like rats and take over the nation , like brussels , malmoe , amsterdam , london ( 40 % white british ) where the ethnic white natives are less than 50 % ... immigration of third world muslims is genocide !, 
  france has 15 million non-whites and is a complete shithole ... make more european children to save white western civilization !,
