i am willing to give up 10 % of my standard if that means that these people do n't have to suffer anymore i think 10 % is not even close to enough , 
  so , as i suspected , i would be wasting my time trying to teach you anything . 
  i 'm glad i did n't bother typing out a big long post . 
  have a nice say . 
   no , it 's a `` living within your means '' problem so like i said , some people still have n't bothered to try to learn what is actually going on here . 
  you are picking a narrative which obviously appeals to you , but is incongruent with the economics . 
   either the economy increases its productivity towards german levels , or the wages and welfare decreases towards albanian levels . 
  well , actually , those are not the only two possible outcomes here . 
  i 'm not sure if it is really worth my time going into detail though , since you seem to think you have figured everything out already . 
  man , i must keep my eyes open more next time . 
  maybe i was also not really * looking * for it though . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's actually mind-bending that this has n't happened yet . 
   v-man 's clown show happened , wild plans to cheat the rest of the euro area . 
  makes it difficult to believe anything will change in greece , no matter how many bailouts they get . 
  i see some people still have n't bothered to try to learn what is actually going on here and still believe this is some kind of ` us versus them ' problem which can only be solved by forcing greece to be more like germany . 
  i want a galette now ;(, 
  i had some d\u00f6ner kebab like two days ago - in 2015 this is the stereotypical national dish, 
  is galette from a certain region in france ? 
  i think i saw them more when i was in bretagne and i do n't think i saw them anywhere else, 
  that is beautiful, 
  what 's the difference between extending the funding as debt or equity here really ? 
  honest question . 
  lovely quote , thanks !, 
  the german politicians have painted themselves into a bit of a corner domestically . 
  it is their own fault of course , but that is why they are trying to resist imf/us/uk / ecb/france/italy pressure here . 
  of course , they are going to lose . 
   what if , in 2010 , ez decided that the way to deal with the crisis , would be eurobonds and printing money ? 
  i have a limited knowledge but , considering they could do it in a way that dropped the conversion rate to 1:1 with dollar , i think it would be us 's worst nightmare . 
  it is an interesting ` what if ' . 
  i personally believe we would have seen a less diverse range of responses to the eurozone crisis than we see now , where some suffer quite a lot more than others . 
  of course , if we are talking about a total response to the crisis , i do n't think anyone - eu , uk and us - got it 100 % right . 
  many conservatives were worried about hyperinflation in a period where we are actually more like the 1930s i.e. 
  depression . 
  since then , us has left the austerity idea , the uk has ` sort of ' left it , but europe is still doubling-down for it ; even this week !, 
   of course , the structural reforms should have been applied in greece in order to become a `` healthy '' state . 
  i think as outsiders , we can look at how greeks do x or y and think it is sub-optimal . 
  but really i think the effect of these things is second-order compared to the choice to take austerity over * actual macroeconomics * . 
  well , i mean , did n't we all * know * hyperinflation was coming in 2008 ? 
  more likely will be a legislated change than a judicial ruling , or am i wrong ? 
  to be honest , the right way to do this would be how the americans and the british did it : the central bank just prints the money from thin air and bails everyone out . 
  of course , can you guess which country complained the most when this was suggested for the ecb to act like , you know , an actual central bank ? 
   the ecb 's website suggests this is not possible well , there is really no two ways about it . 
  two of the institutions are now calling for it . 
  it will happen . 
  somehow the ecb can decide to drop the greek banks in 1 second , even though they passed the stress tests , but you think somehow we ca n't negotiate a debt relief ? 
  just remember , no matter how he tries to act like some kind of moral guardian , he was implicated in a scandal around political contributions which ended his hopes of being chancellor . 
  he is no different . 
  i do n't know why , but this reminded me of this british show [ phoneshop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasybvwlxgu ), 
  do you listen to yourself ? 
   greece is already the largest borrower , and ** has n't even tried to introduce reforms ** into it 's economy and  which a ) is proof that the ** measures imposed on them are working ** and should be continued i get the distinct impression that i am wasting my time discussing this with you , sorry . 
  the twilight zone of 20th century macroeconomics ? 
  if you really did study economics in germany , your strange views are at least explained to the observer . 
  i suppose you think jm keynes was a communist ? 
  another point i just learned catching up today 's news : * mario draghi said it is ` uncontroversial ' that greece needs debt relief . 
  so this means of the troika , both the imf and the ecb are now saying debt relief is required . 
   it comes down to the fact that tsipras vastly overestimated his bargaining powers and position and underestimated germany 's and other nations willingness to let things get this bad . 
  i think this i agree with . 
  i 'm sure tsipras and varoufakis learned * very quickly * how little leverage they had , though . 
  they probably did go into the first meetings thinking they could negotiate in good faith and from an economic point of view . 
  then they meet someone like ws , who is happy to pretend that the rules matter more than the outcomes ( unless it is about accepting political donations ! ), 
   you seem to have a really shaking understanding of both economics and democracy . 
  i have the same opinion about you . 
  is n't the world funny ? 
  personally i think it went more like this : * they knew or suspected that the imf was going to insist on debt relief - a report leaked the week before the referendum was suggesting just this , and the greek government may have had allies within the imf giving them this information earlier than that . 
  * they knew the eurogroup would insist on including the imf , and thus made a big show about how they did n't want the imf included , only to concede on this point later and agree to ask for imf help - this is a critical concession which helps secure a deal from the creditors . 
  * the imf , lo and behold , comes out with the demands for debt relief ; the programme can not work without the imf and hence we will more than likely see debt relief . 
  if this puts the viability of the deal at risk , this is now not greece 's problem given how they have ` submitted ' , and the other creditors will be forced to find a solution . 
  in other words : they will have to follow through with some debt relief . 
  ehhhh the imf is actually now admitting that its programme has not produced the intended effects and that debt relief is required . 
  as for ` greece did n't do reforms ' , i 'm so tired of this trope i can barely bring myself to respond to it any more , but you should check out a few things . 
  first of all , greek has had * the largest * change in structural balance in the entire eurozone ; second , they now have * the largest * cyclically adjusted primary surplus in europe ; third , although it is difficult to ` aggregate ' how much reform has ` been done ' , the oecd did attempt to do just that and concluded that greece had ` done the most ' . 
  you can check out their report for the methodology . 
  sorry about him . 
  not all germans think like that . 
   ask yourself where all the other big states are and why we do n't hear anything from them like france that currently wants to destroy the euro and europe on their own through reckless spending , too . 
  then there is italy which is its own shitshow . 
  where did you study economics ? 
  what a silly point of view . 
   greece tried to outplay the whole eu with brinkmanship and game theory and lost . 
  i think that is a naive reading . 
  since the eurogroup ` crucified ' tsipras on sunday night , what have we learned ? 
  * the eurogroup itself is deeply divided over the approach to the crisis , with only france , italy and cyprus backing a deal . 
  all the other little sheep lined up behind germany . 
  the franco-german special relationship has been extremely strained by this . 
  * tempers reached such a point during the finmin meeting on saturday night that sch\u00e4uble apparently felt he needed to shout at mario draghi that ' i am not stupid ' - makes you wonder what mit economics phd draghi felt he needed to explain to sch\u00e4uble ? 
  * merkel and sch\u00e4uble have publicly disagreed over the course to take , and sch\u00e4uble has recommended that mps vote against the deal . 
  this is big for domestic politics in germany because it is not * 100 % * clear that the bundestag is going to vote in favour of this on the first try - which will be devastating to merkel 's international stature . 
  * the imf has come down firmly on several issues , including that it will not be part of another deal for greece which does not include debt relief . 
  in case you forgot , this is one of the main things varoufakis was hoping to achieve * the imf has also made it public that they think germany is benefitting from the weaker euro in an unsustainable way . 
  this is the same imf that the greeks * apparently * objected strongly to having included in the new deal , which probably only resulted in germany insisting even more on their inclusion . 
  in hindsight , do you think the greeks really opposed including the imf or have they played the germans like a fiddle ? 
  the referendum was a masterstroke , i still believe , because it forced some more disturbing behaviour from the eurogroup : the ecb was forced to do what no economist expected them to do and withhold liquidity from the bank of greece and thus all private banks in greece . 
  in other words , they held the greek economy to ransom . 
  it also meant that the eurogroup had to consciously trample over the democratic wishes of an emu member state in the name of ` technocracy ' - this is instructive for all of us who believed that the union was all about solidarity ; clearly this is * still * all about protecting national interests the outcome of all the above is not clear yet , but i think it is pretty certain that we will see debt relief being introduced to the deal ( making it even harder for merkel to pass through the bundestag ; a fate she completely deserves for letting this ridiculous nationalistic anti-greek narrative fester in the first place ) . 
  anyway , just my opinions , but i do n't think you could say the greeks got ` outplayed ' so certainly . 
  if you read varoufakis ' interview in the new statesman , it sounds like they were aware pretty early on in the negotiations that the eurogroup was ` not going to renegotiate the programme ' . 
  so that did give them five months to come up with something . 
   krugman is also not the be-all end-all economist . 
  of course not , but i do n't think people like your or me have much right to think we know better .
