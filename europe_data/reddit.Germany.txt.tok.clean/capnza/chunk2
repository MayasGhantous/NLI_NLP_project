  besides , what he is doing there is pretty transparent analysis which you can do for yourself if you want to . 
  if the bundestag votes down a plan which is sanctioned by the imf and the ec , we are going to have a total shitstorm . 
  merkel can not allow such a thing to happen , it will severely impact her international stature if it becomes clear that she is not in control of her own party . 
   but any economist knew that `` the banks will open within 24 hours '' is a blatant lie . 
  i have an economics degree ( i do n't think i would go so far to say i work professionally as * an economist * ) ; i did n't * know * that . 
  you are just making things up and pretending they are obvious facts . 
  would you like to try again ? 
   how is it a speculation ? 
  the banks can not open properly without funding from the eu and it was clear that a deal can not be reached within 24 ( or 48 according to tsipras ) hours . 
  [ i am not even talking about withdrawing capital controls ] . 
  more like , it is common sense . 
  reality : very few people expected the ecb to act like a mafia enforcer for the troika . 
  it will be interesting in the coming years to hear memoirs of draghi and see who was really behind this and what was the legal basis they used . 
   greece was the fastest growing economy in the eurozone last year before syriza started winning each and every one of the polls i guess you do n't really keep up with the economics blogosphere . 
  see krugman on this trope [ here ] ( http://nyti.ms/1k6ar1r ) . 
  i do n't think your grasp of english is as good as you think it is . 
  you are both very angry and very wrong . 
  that must be sad for you . 
  it is not possible now . 
  france and italy ( and cyprus ) have made it clear they will not accept that . 
  so now what will happen is simple , i think . 
  the imf will require debt relief , and debt relief will be included in the plan . 
  luckily for us , we are not bound by the limits of your imagination here . 
   so , varoufakis is either a liar or an idiot . 
  in your world , only idiots get things wrong ? 
  that must be nice for you . 
   i doubt it is the second one because , simply put , everyone knew that the banks would not open within 24 hours . 
  no , i do n't think they everyone did * know * that . 
  you are just speculating and you expect me to agree ? 
   if varoufakis ' gambit wins , the eurozone would have to deal with another `` rebellion '' from spain and podemos . 
  the fact that you think this is a ` rebellion ' is a problem itself . 
  i mean , you think austerity is working or what ? 
  last i saw , annual gdp growth in germany is around 0.1 % - what an economic miracle !, 
  nice post !, 
  thanks . 
  made me chuckle a few times, 
   my family and friends for example were pretty upset about `` the brazen greek behaviour , the insults against ( sch\u00e4uble / merkel/germans ) , etc , etc.pp . '', 
  but hopefully you can see this means they actually do n't really understand what is going on here ? 
  anyone who discusses this situation by talking about morals or national stereotypes is just totally missing the point . 
   but if we ( the eu ) should allocate and transfer money like a federal union , greece must accept greater federal oversight . 
  inspectors , vetos , demands , reforms , the work . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure how tsuch a system should work in the details , all i know is that we * need * it for the euro to live . 
  i am personally in favour of total european integration so hopefully this will be a huge driving factor in that, 
  you do n't have to believe me that debt relief is the proper solution here . 
  the [ imf ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15186.pdf ) also says so . 
  there is plenty of detail in there for you . 
  i 'm going to bed now , but i will reply tomorrow if you have more questions after you finish the imf thing, 
  well at this point , who is playing chicken ? 
  germany has basically just forced the worst deal imaginable on greece , so how could american ` meddling ' make it worse ? 
  the imf is a multi-faceted organisation and i believe there are economists working there who have been opposed to the ` official stance ' on the entire eurozone crisis response for a long time . 
  so yes , it is nice to see one of the troika members finally bringing some economic reality into these talks . 
  although , if you asked me to bet beforehand which of the troika would be the one to do it , i would have bet everything on the imf . 
  time to submit a request to the ministry of silly ~ ~ walks ~ ~ words, 
  there are many people who are incentivised to ` not understand ' the need for a fiscal union . 
  i did n't see germany admit the reforms wo n't work etc ? 
  there are good reasons that the imf does not do this : they are supposed to be the only party who will lend to you when your reputation is totally gone . 
  so if you can not pay back this lender , the one who will literally loan to you in the deepest pit , then you will probably never have credibility to borrow again . 
  maybe this is not * so * applicable in this case to greece ; i think this is more a lesson for the eurogroup creditors to say , why the fuck is the imf having to get involved with developed countries in the first place ? 
   it 's ** both ** legal ** ( 1 ) ** , political ** ( 2 ) ** and financial ** ( 3 ) ** . 
  i coulnd ' t resist , sorry !, 
  :d so for the english speakers here , is there a word in english equivalent to ` both ' but for three things ? 
  now i am interested  politically , i 'm speculating , but the americans want this sorted , which means debt relief , so they will want to put pressure on the germans . 
  this is also my opinion . 
  america waited to see what europe will come up with , saw the fucking retarded plan they crapped out , and decided it is time to get involved more directly . 
  nah , everyday germans wo n't care if their arrogant politicans get outplayed ; in the end there is a strong sense of solidarity with the * people * of greece , i think . 
  not everyone reads bild , 
  i hope i do n't meet this farmer , i always put a drop of water in my whisky !, 
  that is sort of what i am saying ; i do n't think a deal can happen * without * the imf , so by the imf saying they will only be involved with a deal including debt relief this does n't leave much room for the other creditors to move . 
  they already committed to a deal with greece , so now they have to make it happen . 
  so if the imf says debt relief , i think we will see debt relief in the plan . 
  and i think this is the kind of deal the american * expected * ( hoped ? ), 
  the eurogroup to reach on their own . 
  now that it is clear the eurogroup is a totally impotent decision-making joke , the americans are pressing the issue by making the imf issue this ultimatum . 
  still just my theory ;p, 
   seriously , how am i supposed to take someone serious on this topic who refers to the hard won agreements of the last week as a `` ritual humiliation '' ? 
  no , that is precisely correct . 
  no one should believe the ` deal ' reached this week was worth the paper it was written on . 
  all it showed us is that there is no political will in the eurogroup to * really * solve the problem . 
  all they want to do is ` kick the can ' and then maybe someone else will have to deal with it in 3 years time, 
  fighting words !, 
  i do n't think that is feasible now , because of the way the eurogroup totally domineered greece . 
  this is now not greece 's problem at all , this is the problem of the creditors . 
  they ca n't * possibly * go back to greece now , after forcing that shitty deal , and say `` oh well , you can just get fucked after all '' . 
  no ; the more realistic path forward here is debt relief will be included in the deal . 
  i suggest you read it again . 
  i think it is a powerful way to introduce several unintuitive macroeconomic topics . 
  every time i 've seen him invoke it , he does usually go on to explain the implications for a wider economy, 
  nah ; the only way forward from here is debt relief . 
  there is no way the eurogroup will try to solve this without the imf . 
  this must be american impetus , i think . 
  i doubt that the americans would consider the ` deal ' which the eurogroup barely managed to cobble together is particularly impressive . 
  they have waited to let the eurogroup reach the best solution they could and now are putting pressure on for a better approach ? 
  just a theory, 
  good question - must come down to politics within the imf itself, 
  well of course , but it seems to have paid off if that is the case, 
  are you referring to the baby-sitting syndicate with the coupons ? 
  just a heads-up , this guy is either trolling or just braindead . 
  either way , save yourself the time, 
  hah , also a nice dynamic !, 
  maybe i am just convincing myself of a theory i like , but i 'm starting to think more and more that the eurogroup got played in a way they have n't fully realised yet,
