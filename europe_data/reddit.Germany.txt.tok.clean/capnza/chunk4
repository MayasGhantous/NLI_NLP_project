  to suggest that the common greek people are somehow complicit in the abject failure of these elites to institute reforms which would have reduced their ability to use the state as their piggybanks is just unrealistic . 
  those people are effectively disenfranchised . 
  to be honest , we do n't need to cite yv on this . 
  anyone who has an economics degree from a university * outside * the german twilight zone of economics will conclude the same , as will any banker . 
  is this not the same leaked report from the week of the referendum ? 
  you need to identify the difference between * telling a lie * and * being wrong * . 
  instead we should listen to you , the guy from the internet ? 
   the adage is normally about not yelling fire if there is n't an actual fire . 
  the point is that the only examples you could come up with are cases where he was clearly trying to assuage public opinion and mitigate the chances of some kind of self-fulfilling frenzy of people withdrawing their money . 
  further to which , it is possible he did believe the banks would open . 
  he is not a prophet . 
  if i make an assertion based on my sincere beliefs and it turns out to be incorrect , is that a * lie * ? 
  i think partly this is driven by the fact that the eurogroup at the moment is not convened by any treaty ; it is * ad hoc * and there are no rules guiding what it can and can not do . 
  it would be better to codify how the interactions between the eurozone countries * must * take places in a parliamentary framework . 
  for those of us who are not in-touch with french politics , is hollande going to lose to a more left-wing or right-wing candidate , in your view ? 
  i have heard him criticised as having ` capitulated ' to germany demands on many things which his ` left ' base is not happy . 
  can you try to ask some specific questions ? 
  that post is impossible to engage with , in my opinion . 
  i think his position is that - although greece should not have gone into it - once you are in , you are in for good . 
  so the best examples you can conjure up are similar to the old adage about not shouting fire in a packed theater ? 
  forgive me for not being convinced of your thesis . 
  i 'm basically english-fluent and my interpretation of yv in that section you reference is not that he is hedging himself , but that he is making a differentiation between something * reported * and something * paraphrased * . 
  ymmv . 
  op , you have done an amazing job . 
  in case yuo wish to use this elsewhere , just a few amendments from me which i picked up on my listen through : * a look at greece where there may ** not ** be much ~ ~ [ inaudible ] ~ ~ ** to eat ** of any sort . 
  * denounced the terms and ~ ~ [ inaudible ] ~ ~ ** reported ** that the conditions are so tough * that it poses a perhaps impossible political ~ ~ pass ~ ~ ** task ** for the [ greek ] prime minister * i entered the prime ministerial office ~ ~ late ~ ~ ** elated ** * a minimum requirement for retaining ~ ~ this ~ ~ ** its ** hope for the future * to have to struggle against them in order to come ~ ~ up ~ ~ ** back ** with something that is palatable . 
  * there was a public display of discord between us when he ~ ~ [ inaudible ] ~ ~ ** leant into ** into my office * the decision to enter politics was a ~ ~ different ~ ~ ** difficult ** one * well , this will make it all the harder for him to push this through to ~ ~ a vote to stay ~ ~ ** avert the state ** bankruptcy * humiliation is ~ ~ [ inaudible ] ~ ~ ** piled ** on humiliation * so , imagine that the greek ~ ~ government had ~ ~ ** government 's head ** , submerged in water , cia-like * all sorts of bills that ~ ~ are ~ ~ ** run ** completely against our mandate * it 's an outrageous defeat -- not ~ ~ of ~ ~ ** for ** greece -- but for the european project * saying the figures the greeks submitted were not ~ ~ the legal [ inaudible ] ~ ~ ** believable ** * who for many years has been a commentator on matters grecian and this is ~ ~ [ inaudible ] ~ ~ ** lnl on rn ** ( ** l ** ate ** n ** ight ** l ** ive ; but could probably cut this whole section from the transcript ? ), 
  * well , ~ ~ i will ~ ~ ** let me ** be open and clear on this * we never ~ ~ had failed to have ~ ~ ** felt we had ** a mandate to do this * and it takes incredible folly to think that you can control ~ ~ [ it ] ~ ~ ** them ** .

  haha , i saw that . 
  it seemed so informal . 
  why do n't they all just send proxy voters and stay at home ? 
  haha , yes it looks like a lot of constructive debate took place and the document evolved as the considerations of all the eurogroup members were taken into account . 
  i 'm a bit confused with the tory flirtation with austerity to be honest . 
  i think they cimply are using it as an excuse to cut welfare spending and corresponding taxes on the rich tory backers . 
  here in europe i think there is actually belief that these policies * will work * . 
   the eu lacks credible institutions to resolve a crisis . 
  that is n't germany 's fault , it 's the whole system . 
  the fact that the government of germany ( as opposed to any eu representative , even germany 's ) has such an important leadership role is part of the problem . 
  hmm i do n't know . 
  we can fix this very quickly if the political will exists . 
  yet it does n't , which suggests that national governments prefer this current broken system . 
  since germany benefits a lot from it , i think we * can * say that the continued broken structure is ( partially ) germany 's fault, 
   the anglo-american tradition is by far the most developed , tested , and learned economic orthodoxy in the world . 
  it 's foolish to ignore the advice of others -- especially friends -- for the sake of pride . 
  we can all stand to learn something from one other . 
  that is a nice way to summarise it , i think . 
  it is n't going to happen anyway :p, 
  there 's no need for you to be a cunt . 
   did you read the reforms ? 
  they 're mainly about deregulation , privatisation , reducing the public sector , taking power away from the unions and shifting the tax base to more regressive taxes . 
  these are all right-wing free market ideas . 
  i wo n't disagree with you if you call these ideas ** right wing ** but i do n't think you can simply co-opt the term ` free market ' to mean anything that fucks working people over in the favour of the rich . 
   austerity is just a derogatory term used by the left to create fear about conservative policies . 
  austerity in this context is the alesina expansionary austerity theory . 
  have you even read any of his papers on the topic ? 
   keynesianism is a leftist ideology snore . 
  what decade are you getting this stuff from , the 60s ? 
  let me make this easy for both of us : summarise the key differences between the real business cycle and new keynesian macroeconomic models . 
  if you ca n't do this , then it just proves beyond a doubt you do n't actually * know * anything about keynesian economics - you just read somewhere it is ` leftist ' and never thought to check for yourself . 
   i do n't want to get into semantics about the exact definitions of these terms . 
  that makes sense , since you seem to have no idea * at all * what they mean . 
  i think that would be great frmo a politics point of view , to be honest . 
  germany has not demonstrated inspiring leadership in this whole crisis . 
  oh well , we can imagine !, 
  oh yes , i do remember him actualy . 
  will google a bit, 
  thanks, 
  do n't you think it would be fun to get to exert some more influence in the eurozone , even if it is just to piss of merkel ? 
   i wonder how long it will take the finns to realise that they would have revived by now if they were n't in the euro ? 
  this is now something i am becoming very interested in too ; since finland is a poster boy for austerity and good governance . 
  what bullshit programme of reforms will ws suggest for them i wonder ? 
   the policy measures they 're being forced to implement are all free-market ideas , it 's like the sensible countries of europe had to sit them down and explain to the socialists how economics works . 
  i do n't know where you studied economics , but at my university we didn ; t consider austerity to be ` free market economics ' and we did n't consider keynesianism to be socialism . 
  ymmv, 
  thanks , will check it out . 
  these last days have really taken a toll . 
  i stayed up all night saturday and sunday to keep up with developments, 
  link to ft article ? 
  that paywall is easy to circumvent, 
  you know , at this point i have so little trust for the german politicians that i think including the brits could only improve the situation . 
  not that this will ever happen , of course . 
  edit : i think i just realised something : if this is a legitimate request then doesn ; ' t this just signal that germany is admitting it is totally inept when it comes to managing these kinds of crises and they feel they need the brits to do it instead ? 
  makes you wonder why they bother spending all our fucking money on these meetings anyway . 
   apparently to spite rajoy because he ~ ~ is a cunt ~ ~ ~ ~ supported samaras ~ ~ is a cunt, 
  sounds a bit like fifa voting or something, 
  hah really ? 
  ii didnt hear this, 
  thanks ; interesting reply, 
  i do n't disagree with any of that . 
  but still , i think my sympathies lie with yv on this . 
  he seemed to truly want to find a better solution for both sides , but he was met with pure politics . 
  obviously he was n't prepared for it , but i think that should reflect badly on the eurogroup too . 
  it is sad that the body which we think is going to solve these kind of problems is too rigid and dogmatic to do anything of the sort, 
  i 'm not really in the mood to get into some huge argument ; you seem very angry and i 'm too tired to bother finding sources for anything i want to say . 
   are you serious ? 
  gdp wise internet is becoming a bigger sector then agriculture in some countries so how do you measure his assertion ? 
  i 'm not trying to be difficult , i 'm interested because you made it sound like what he said is obviously wrong, 
  well , what do you mean by ` back then ' ?
