  he is n't close to a legend and just popular in certain circle but not the population as a hole . 
  stefan raab , g\u00fcnther jauch or thomas gottschalk those are universally known `` legends '' . 
  not this guy, 
   is this guy well known ? 
  if we make the song famous in turkey , is he in danger ? 
  i did not know him , so i would say that * today * he is not famous anymore . 
  but he is older , so maybe he used to be more famous . 
  it is the typical [ streisand effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) to the song itself . 
  it is not good nor intelligent . 
  it is more in direction cringe and the only somewhat sophistication is the rhyme . 
  but it is not as insulting as the b\u00f6mernman poem and closer to typical satire . 
  looks very good . 
  but i would prefer if there would be a collection of header images , which change randomly every time you visit the site . 
  source : i am the source, 
  it does not matter what the population thinks only politicians matter , cause they decide the use of military . 
  i do not see the relevance of this poll, 
  i think that you get used to the look of something you use everyday , thus it appears boring and mundane, 
  in general bills are overloaded with stylistic elements i wish they would design ones that are more minimalistic and reduced, 
  well it is * implied * that he is a muslem . 
  op should have clarified it , else it is too ambigous, 
  second setence . 
  but complaining about `` america '' instead of `` united states of america '' . 
  / r/asablackman he is muslim , so he can speak for ** all ** other muslims in his country, 
  some stuff comes from 4chan , but the effect or influence is well exaggerated . 
  3  0 so yes, 
  and lower the smoking age to 16 again ? 
  not as bad as - gate . 
  dafuq there is a wiki article for them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_scandals_with_%22-gate%22_suffix, 
  yeah putin is billionair, 
  politicians are n't that rich . 
  just compare them to bosses or ceos in big corps or bankers . 
  what was the hijackers goal ? 
  wishful , utopic thinking about extreme advances in technology ! = making decisions based on facts and reality, 
  but why are you a musk fanboy only thing worse than hyperloop is the `` emdrive '', 
  hyperloop is the most stupid thing i have ever heard . 
  high speed trains are already too expensive and the time saving does not justify the increased cost, 
  oil was a reason plus geopolitics, 
   elements likely to join the enemy 's side . 
  you can not jail anyone on suspicion . 
  what do you propose ; jail all muslims in belgium , cause they are potentially isis sympathizers . 
  thought crimes are a thing now, 
   nazism do you blame the everyday normal population who voted for the nazis or dou blame hitler and the few elites for the crimes and deaths . 
  every time people talk about nazi germany people protect the general population saying that they did n't know or did n't wanted it . 
  all germany are therefore war criminals , according your analogy . 
  same with muslims i would say . 
  but the date of this site ends in 2014, 
  do you think the the gov is lying or that they will waste money on useless projects ? 
  what do you think about stuttgart 21 ? 
  but since they now have heard all the superior french music , this change of law should n't effect the percentage of french music played in radio . 
  thanks to reeducating people to the right taste , they will from now on demand more french music in the future by themselves . 
  yes i am . 
  apparently ppl prefere to hear non french stuff , so forcing them to hear something they do not like will make them dislike it even more . 
  probably just american stuff . 
  protectionism is really stupid, 
  unfortunately not and more current number for asylum . 
  in feb 2016 66 % got asylum status . 
  here in germany it is much lower and germany has most asylum seekers ( in absolute numbers ) , so eu wide i think it might be 60-65 % . 
  keep in mind that about only 50 % are granted asylum, 
  i am pretty tired of the myth that germany is so green and eco . 
  we are investing , but currently it is still pretty bad , due to coal and the shut down of nuclear plants . 
  how is the debate concerning refugees in turkey ? 
  is it similar compared to those in european countries ? 
  crystal meth, 
  populism wont do what it promised . 
  people think/claim that obama was a socialist . 
  political branding in the us is kinda bonkers or people intentionally mislabel, 
  populism needs to die asap . 
  always blame on the elits and not care about facts/reality, 
  the polls were right in terms of popular vote, 
  what did he do ? 
   let 's constantly call the opposition stupid it is the consequence of that voting not the cause . 
  it dos not make a differecne wheter you call them out or not , since they do not give a damn about those elites/experts etc. 
  hope that people notice how stupid the anti establishment/elite hype is, 
  the afd is not even anti establishment , which was donalds main selling point, 
  it is crazy how every new president tries something . 
  so much variation and so little consistency, 
  space is usually prestige ( except for satelites ) or scientific knowledge gain without irl advantage, 
  because the resource sun is local but co2 global, 
   you 've got any source for this ? 
   the current administration introduced a minimum wage , a minimum rent and is about to increase rent overall - that is not economically conservative . 
  they only did so cause they had to do it , since they were in coalition with spd . 
  also merkel is a strong supporter of agenda 2010 aka reducing social benefits and deregulate the market . 
   afd afd is not conservative . 
  they are reactionary . 
  cdu is still economically conservative and in terms of gay marriage, 
  cdu ( merkel 's party ) is center-right/conservative . 
  china with 2 percent is surprisingly high, 
  if there is no law against it , private research institutes could do the polls, 
  at the beginning there were many more moderate groups . 
  but those mostly gave up and fled to the west o neighboring countries, 
  he is so smug and arrogant telling his one sided narrative . 
   i do n't know about confusion , but anyone who gets information from msm is so badly misinformed about syria that talking with them about syria is recipe for good laugh . 
  mainstream media aka 2 minute slot in the tv news . 
  online msm has reported extensively about the civil war and also about the issues of the rebels . 
  you understand that moderate rebels are several different groups . 
  people would be confused if the media would differentiate between too many names and factions . 
  using scientific notation instead of mil, 
  minimum wage in romania is 1,65 $ / hour, 
  budget surplus,
