  you can see where it has been reformed in the graph, 
  not answering the questions and diverting the topic . 
  seems like a good idea, 
   it 's not always delayed . 
  but most of the time . 
  in particular if it is not an emergency or short term measure  they did n't have an impact also in the long-run . 
  of course they have . 
  all the deregulation with for example `` leiharbeit '' and the whole low wage sector which grew immensely https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/entwicklung_der_leiharbeit_1980-2010.png, 
  the impact in macro economy is always delayed . 
  people think that automatization and globalisation is bad . 
  macro economics do not matter to most, 
   germany passed from being the sick man of europe to its powerhouse , mostly due to the euro . 
  it is mostly due to agenda 2010 and stagnant real wages . 
  how can one be sure that it is due to the euro, 
  difference is that it gets corrected . 
  http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/graphics/d27_2bv_d.gif more half a decade but similar, 
  yes . 
  it did happen in the past and it will happen again , in particular with current climate, 
  how it [ looks ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df0330c1c0d0095387e61e3abde7f778e54ef78/0_7_1100_1375/1100.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f46ee9aa666abb2e39b398669d4cd6a5 ) like, 
  some country has to take them back, 
  why would refugees receive citizenship , tho ? 
  to further his narrative . 
  doing a gingi comparison before taxes is completely pointless, 
  not every refuge can stay was her stance since ever, 
  only on certain aspects, 
  do not italians become vote fatigue if they have to reelect almost every year, 
  thats is not true at all . 
  what you mention is classic liberalism , except for that crony capitalism which is promoted by populism . 
  right wing populism is against free market and a strong ( aka big ) government enforcing the nationalistic , isolationistic ( anti globalist ) economic policies . 
  this limits your property rights , your economic liberty and gives the ( big ) gov more chances for corruption . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5gi12f/italy_constitutional_referendum_first_exit_poll/daseyed/ ), 
  trump only won due to the geographical distribution of voters . 
  brexit was pretty much 50/50 at the end, 
  those experts and their organizations with [ acronyms ] ( https://youtu.be/gggigtjk7ma?t=23s ) . 
  all just part of a globalist elite conspiracy, 
  `` asks '' question does not get the answer he wants to hear and its butthurt, 
   go elites !, 
  go corporations !, 
  you imply that populism would actually solve those problems or get rid of them . 
  in reality they are just boogemans to get the vote . 
  populism is appeal to emotion instead of appeal to facts . 
  due to the rise of populism we have reached post factual politics, 
  bernie sanders and varoufakis are left wing populists . 
  but most of the normal left are not . 
  every time unemployment goes up . 
  the economy is shit and people are loosing their jobs . 
  the situation is horrible . 
  every time the unemployment goes down . 
  the economy is shit and it is just made up statistics . 
  the situation is horrible, 
  good news from erdogan . 
  but muh narrative, 
  this totally justifies my contrarian non credible evidence based conspiracy world view . 
  all hail to infowars the only true news site, 
  it is because english is an easy language which is learned most over the world, 
  mexicans are not comparable to middle eastern or north african migrants, 
  if someone would ask such a stupid question i would say yes , just to fuck up statistics, 
  no it is not, 
  bernie being old as fuck and still running for pres has lots to do when discussion age of politicians in germany, 
  do people vote party based on chancellor candidate ? 
  now think that some bernie bros are happy cause he has not ruled out to run in 2020 . 
  absolute insanity . 
  politicians should go into retirement at a normal retirement age, 
  he even lost in popular vote, 
  they actually dub in many languages . 
  do more promotion if you think that the channel is unjustified unpopular . 
  what about the tv channel ** euronews **, 
  they euro army would be similar to the esa with national armies remaining . 
  also veto right is the most stupid concept ever brought into political decision making . 
  make the hurdles high but unanimousity is so rare . 
  an eu army is in the current and mid term future very unrealistic anyways if not impossible . 
  european version of nato is more realisitc ,, 
  it never was . 
  there have always been critical voices in the media in terms of terrorism, 
   you fail to recall how extreme the pro-migrants were last year . 
  they never were onr r/europe . 
  so popular that he lost against hilary clinton . 
  he is popular on reddit but reddit is not representative, 
  during the global crisis the german government invested heavily in renovation of public buildings and gave 2500 euro for everyone buying a new car and wreaking the old one . 
  they were a prime example of keynesian anti cyclical spending, 
  people did not vote based on policy . 
  they will now try with google translate french . 
   vision-less , poll-by-poll governing career politicians are not supposed to enforce their own ideology and ideas they are supposed to represent the ideas of the people ( as in representative democracy ) . 
  changing what people want within reasonable limits is a good thing  populist governance one of the main selling point of populism is being anti elite and anti establishment . 
  she did not do that all, 
   being swayed on your positions based on polling to ensure you can always say you did what the people wanted is the definition of populist . 
  populist has nothing to do with popular ( opinion or stance ) it has to do with populus aka the people . 
   the word populism is derived from the latin word populus , which means people in english ( in the sense of `` folk '' , `` nation '' , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/populism  populism is a mode of political communication that is centred around contrasts between the `` common man '' or `` the people '' and a real or imagined group of `` privileged elites '' , traditionally scapegoating or making a folk devil of the latter . 
  populists can fall anywhere on the traditional left -- right political spectrum of politics , and can often be characterised as centrist where populists portray both bourgeois capitalists and socialist organizers as unfairly dominating the political sphere . 
  [ 1 ] calling popular opinion populist is just incorrectly using this word to discredit your political opponent . 
  this word gets often misused similar to calling everyone nazi, 
  not really . 
  populism is about pretending to be for the common people and the avg joe being against the intellectual elite and anti establishment . 
  it is also about rhetorics , which merkel does not employ . 
  being easily swayed in positions is not being populists, 
  got ta visit the swing states for a gazillionth time, 
  first the came for our sugary drinks but i did not spoke up cause i could buy diet soda . 
  then they came for ... 
  the socialized healthcare part gives them the right . 
  curious if mods remove it for being a local crime,
