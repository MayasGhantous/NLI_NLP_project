currywurst is more fast food than anything . 
  eisbein mit sauerkraut and bratkartoffel would have been a better choice , i guess . 
  or a schnitzel with sauerkraut and bratkartoffel ... something something pork with kraut and potato, 
  nato maybe ? 
  then it would make kinda sense why latvia is hanging onto it . 
  as protection against russia or something like that, 
  bavaria is like the promised land for holidays ( and beer ) . 
  good thing rheinland pfalz is somewhat catholic , too ( sadly not so much beer ), 
   why exactly though ? 
  tell me . 
  what is so extraordinary about it ? 
  why is it `` beautiful '' ? 
  why do people cheer for someone who tries to be as provocative as possible ? 
  whatever floats their boat , i guess . 
  you do n't have to understand it and if you do n't like it , do n't bother . 
  let them have their fun . 
  some people just like extraordianry things . 
  and for some people it 's a great story : a crossdressing , homosexual bearded man , singing a bond-esque song , winning the competition . 
   wow , and now ? 
  if you have a problem with russia the go do something . 
  found a party or some shit but do n't insult innocent people . 
  like i said , i 'm pretty sure they did n't insult the girls in person . 
  and we as normal people can only do so much . 
  the responsibility lies within politics to do something . 
   that just shows that you have no dignity . 
  period . 
  opinions , man . 
   well okay . 
  it 's two things mainly . 
  first the simpler reason : that `` conchita '' person is just repulsive and i can not understand people who actually try to tell me that she/he is beautiful or looks good or some shit because he/she clearly does n't . 
  well , beauty is in the eye of the beholder . 
  it 's sometimes peculiar to see what some people call beautiful . 
  starting with some fashion `` statements '' to body modification . 
  and in the case of conchita , it 's a mixture of political statement ( more or less ) and progressive personalia . 
  i do n't know how many people would call her beautiful in the meaning of `` i fell in love in first sight '' but more like `` i like what she does , what she looks like and what she stands for , and that 's beautiful '' . 
   being tolerant does n't mean i somehow have to force myself to like something but simply accepting it 's existence - always keep that in mind . 
  exactly . 
  and nobody forces you to like something . 
   first , booing at those poor russian girls which have nothing to do at all with the current situation . 
  this shows what `` unworthy '' people the audience was and that in return - you guessed it - disgusts me . 
  you can - as the host - say what you want how unpolitical your event is supposed to be , people will always express their feelings and opinions . 
  and these russian girls were ( like somebody said in this thread ) the literal embodiment of russia that evening , and im sure people were n't booing at the girls per se , but for what they stand for . 
  in this case , russia . 
  and russia dun goofed , imo . 
   which is not only another useless provocation but also completely pointless . 
  what exactly do the people think is achieved by this ? 
  maybe it was just a great performance , too . 
  one does n't win based solely on a political statement . 
  but that is my opinion . 
   putin will not give a flying fuck and the masses will only take it as another hint at the depravity and decadence of the west . 
  i agree . 
  it was easy prey for the russian propaganda machine , but europe 's people made clear that they do n't agree with what russia does, 
  l will listen to you . 
  try to explain your comment to me, 
  norway sounded like the ballad version of last years winning song , imo, 
  how can a man with such a glorious beard want to be a woman ? 
  it 's like he/she is mocking me !, 
  `` even a woman has a better beard than you , carl ! '', 
  oh , and i think the song was quite good . 
  maybe not the best ( i liked iceland ) but not a undeserved victory, 
  it 's genderbended merkel with bad teeth . 
  everyone loves merkel , so vote for him, 
  german city of where ? 
  there is a god out there !, 
  seriously , fuck this shit . 
  people must understand that they vote for a party and not the kanzler . 
  i 've read here on reddit , that a redditors friend used the `` wahl-o-mat '' and he/she had a just about 30 % overlap with the cdu/csu . 
  he/she will still vote for them , ` cuz merkel . 
  i almost hope now , that they will pull the biggest shit out of their asses the next four years , so people will know , what they 've done . 
  you know uk is n't europe , 
  wow , did n't think we do n't really fall too far behind in terms of redness . 
  maybe if the scale was wider , the difference would be larger . 
  because i have n't heard of smog in europe for quite some time . 
  aww , do n't be so harsh to yourself . 
  compared to mexiko city and shanghai you look splendid , i 'm sure  still , to impose ecologic superiority , we all got ta improve ourselves ( looking at you , basf ), 
  that 's what i heard . 
  all of the baltic states must have gorgeous women . 
  only source i have is one guy spent his holidays in estonia and driving through latvia and lithuania, 
  and still , you can not into nordic :(, 
  she may have 12 more years in her , but i do n't want a kohl 2.0 : /, 
  imo we should call her ex-kanzlerin , soon, 
  the yunguns here just do n't know that she is basically `` am kohlen '' , since helmut kohl used the same `` strategy '' . 
  i hope that this does n't mean 16 years of merkel . 
  i think the new logan is n't being sold in germany . 
  it starts with the sandero afaik, 
  and k\u00f6ln !, 
  [ the german t\u00fcv says porsche , mazda and toyota are the most reliable . 
  ] ( http://www.tuv.com/media/germany/tuev_report/tuev_report_gewinner_und_verlierer_2015.pdf ) of course both our statistics have completely different premises , yours the day by day repairs and mine the reliabilty of the safety related parts of the car . 
  also putting in the cost for the repairs into the statistic is of course harmful for the german manufacturers , epecially porsche . 
  porsches are one of the most reliable cars there is . 
  yes , they are . 
  i 'd rather buy a used car , 3-5 years old for the same money , than a new dacia .

  i , as a trans-fat deep-fried pizza-kin , take offense in your rules . 
  but seriously , some things must be restricted or banned right away . 
  the use of transfats is one of those things , imo, 
  usted havin a pouffer de rire , freund ? 
  you should be ashamed of yourself , cork , ireland . 
  but he seems to be a serious party pooper .
