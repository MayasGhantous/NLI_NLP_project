that 's interesting , in german we also call it slowenien, 
  nah , adhd in germany, 
  i 'm fine with staying the same , no need for constant growth imo, 
  big if true, 
  on the bright side , they might have a cheap vaccination for cholera soon, 
  i volunteer, 
  immigrant and emigrant ? 
  yes , but they are rare, 
  from when is this ? 
  could it be after 2011 because you can clearly see light differences in syria, 
  i dare say , our planet is quite beautiful when i see pictures like these, 
  brought to you by `` das internet ist f\u00fcr uns alle neuland '' merkel ( ~ * the internet is new territory for all of us * ) - 2013, 
  guilty of 3 of those and only because i recently removed the sticker from my webcam :d, 
   the number of tor services within a country can provide hints about the size of the free speech lobbies in each country . 
  huh , but us citizens constantly tell me there is no free speech in germany, 
  so , same as with going green ? 
  that 's a bold claim , let 's see if it pays off for you, 
  probably never heard of reddit , that 's why it 's still not banned in turkey iirc, 
  or the year before ... 
  europe 's terrified cause greece is on fire, 
  that 's the rule in basically every major european city , in paris no building may be taller than the eiffel tower iirc , in cologne nothing may come close to the cathedral and so on, 
  cdu/spd coalition is hated by everyone , they are on different sides of the spectrum and can hardly agree on anything , and when in doubt , take the cdu stance because they got more votes , however , only the spd suffers from this negativity, 
  what are you implying ? 
  da real mvp, 
  itt : fucking fascists, 
  though the germans very much dislike how the ecb is pumping out money like no tomorrow, 
  yes but it specifically is n't so small countries would n't be ignored all the time . 
  edit : as example , germany has ~ 80million inhabitants and gets 96members , czech republic ~ 10million inhabitants and 21members in parliament edit 2 : more on allocation [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament#members ), 
  germany is only as influential as other nations make it out to be, 
  frankfurt is too sterile or * clean * for my taste , the only graffiti i spotted said `` way too clean here '' in german, 
  well london has more than 10x the population, 
  germany also only gets 1 vote like everybody else , except in the european parliament where it 's according to population , and then small countries get overrepresented and large countries underrepresented, 
  more comparable to the hre than eu, 
  never waste a good crisis ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ? 
  well it 's southern tyrol , belonged to austria until wwi, 
  t r i a n o n r i g g e r e d, 
  what 's with the dislikes, 
  [ my titlegame is weak ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/memeeconomy/comments/63wfpz/erdogan_memes_albeit_volatile_could_be_worth/ ) and with this i now am a meme stealing normie : /, 
  i remember upvoting that one , oc ? 
  plz no kinkshame ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  this gives me an idea , can i use this or do you want the karma ? 
  i would gladly be `` they '' if it meant i could shit in his face, 
  orban needs to visit one of [ these ] ( http://euroburn.org/burn-centres-2/ ), 
  you must be new here, 
  lack of ( purchasable ) food often makes people search a new place to live, 
   that *** some *** brits have nothing against poles, 
  austrian spo - oh it 's in the flair, 
  on the one hand , we feel with you , but then again , [ betrayal can never be forgiven ] ( http://www.dafont.com/forum/attach/orig/6/3/639860.jpg ), 
  and just 17years ago this sparked an outrage in germany, 
  i 'm pretty sure he_she was sarcastic, 
  [ and here i thought that was america 's battle cry ] ( https://satwcomic.com/battle-cry ), 
  is hamon affiliated with r\u00e9mi gaillard ? 
  could be [ brain drain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_capital_flight ), 
  when the chinese dumped their prices the solar valley basically collapsed, 
  this makes me so mad , and afaik the fine for this is only 20 $ , riding bicycle without light is 15 $ iirc, 
  stalin did nothing wrong , kulaks deserved worse . 
  maybe i should become a teacher in luxembourg instead, 
  [ what i thought of ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38yhkhggpjs&amp;ab_channel=slorr55 ), 
  moselle franconian , rhine franconian , luxembourgish , hessian , thuringian , upper saxon and apparently berlin dialect , did n't know that one, 
  good point !, 
  but could have been a translated quote, 
  ah right, 
  eeeeh linguistically we do differentiate between lower , central and upper german dialects , frisian would be a low, 
  i 've heard a similar story from a mate who moved to another city for university , shared a flat with a bavarian who never learned * high german * or standarddeutsch , they had to talk in english, 
  probably * schwacher * for lesser, 
  did n't the hohenzollern originate from franconia ? 
  it can be really shaky , but its very safe, 
  i 've never seen one of those , but then again , i 'm only like once in 2months in wuppertal, 
  icelandic finnish hungarian ukrainian basque polish bulgarian no particular order and just of the top of my head, 
  the biggest complaint about german i hear is the genders of things , but that 's not exclusively german , basically every language has genders and those are often arbitrary , there is nothing you can do but learn them with each word . 
  we only have 4 cases , there 's plenty of languages in europe alone that have more than that ( admittely , in some a case replaces a function of other languages ) the pronunciation is almost identical to the ipa grammar is very clearly structured , it 's a logical language . 
  that 's a load of bullshit , sounds like an anglophone wrote it, 
  do n't be sorry , german actually is on the easier scale of languages, 
  it 's a prefix , is every auxiliary translated literally ? 
  that would be horrible for the reversed course , english to german, 
  you probably know that , but english had this as well once , with thou being informal and you being formal, 
  they are far from centrist either, 
  all in luxembourg , around 16 % of luxembourgs population is portuguese , we also have some enclaves in western germany, 
  5 % of 80million are still many people, 
  same here , might have to invest in battery powered lights , but then i have to always take them off because of thieves uuugh, 
  what i love about the heatmap is how you can clearly see the fight over brazils flag and the 7:1 :d, 
  but estonia still is n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ? 
  you think one of those has still functioning light and brakes ? 
  could use one , mine do n't work, 
  they 're hardly more than rocks breaching the surface , 
  like france, 
  friendship regain with ~ ~ mudasir ~ ~ norway, 
  was an organized mutual effort , but i 'd wager more bits were placed by germans, 
  i 'm sceptical about the eagle and eiffel tower , so easy for someone random to fuck it up and harder to maintain due to complicated designs , but could definitely look nice . 
  and you 're right , spain ca n't even agree on which flag to use, 
  yeah i ca n't say i approve of it , but i 'm currently rather not wasting my bits on petty fights and rather help maintaining megaman and building the eagle, 
  na we are already overextended , our current plans are german eagle , beer and flag with belgium and clean up/repel , you can come into the official discord as a diplomat if you want ( #diplomatie ) [ link ] ( https://discord.gg/2vecus3 ) after the eagle and belgium we can help with megaman i suppose, 
  guess who helped you relocate to the north ? 
  germany and france stand with you, 
  you know what we *** really *** should do first ? 
  ask the current placeholders for approval . 
  this unasked aggression has tilted the opinion of france and germany against this plan . 
  also , fuck italy for destroying megaman, 
  when will the french get that it was r/all that did this ?
