  since 2008 applicants also have to possess certain german language skills and pass a test ( with arbitrary questions like `` explain the `` existential right of israel '' '' , `` name three rivers which run through germany '' , `` which german composed at the end of his 9 . 
  symphony the famous `` ode to joy '' ? 
  name 2 more german musicians or composers ! '' ) . 
  until 2014 we had the `` option obligation '' which meant that children with foreign parents had to decide which citizenship they want to adopt between the age of 18-23 , if they had lived for 8 years in germany so far . 
  there are also exceptions for all eu members now , including switzerland , as well as for citizenships where the original country does not allow their people to leave citizenship like afghanistan , iran , lebanon , morocco and tunisia , so all these countries can have dual citizenship with germany without problem . 
  so if you are a a turk or a russian , for example , and want to attain german citizenship while keeping your old one , you would have to prove that losing your original citizenship would cause you unbearable disadvantages in that country . 
  if both your parents do n't hold a german pass but have lived here for 8 years , you get german citizenship and your parents ' citizenship , if the respective country allows that . 
  edit : so uk citizens will probably have to decide between german and uk citizenship as well once they leave , that 's why we currently have such a `` surge '' of uk applications for citizenship , as many uk citizens have lived here but never had to do so due to being in the eu . 
  edit 2 : for the other way around , if a german citizen applies for another citizenship , he has to renounce german citizenship, 
   if i said something inaccurate , feel free to correct me actually , the teutons had anticipated this very move and had therefore hidden extra cavalry battalions and livonian crossbowmen in the nearby woods . 
  when the bulk of the infantry got surrounded the livonians shot a volley into the rear of the polish and lithuanian forces while the cavalry charged straight into the commanders , capturing both and thus enforcing peace in the region ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  wanted to disagree but then remembered varus, 
  ko so vo je, 
   it 's the only place to go if you have any urban ambitions wait there 's also thessaloniki :d, 
  in germany it 's kinda problematic when 3rd or 4th generation `` immigrants '' still prefer their `` home country '' which they have never visited except maybe for a holiday, 
  the brits lose out on some fine dutch !,

  join the discord , most countries are taken but some will probably need a substitute , almost all information can be found [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mlk2j/reuropes_season_3_eu4_campaign_begins_this_sunday/ ), 
  in 1 session !, 
  these things happen , there was nothing you could do, 
  there are 2 in japan now , shimazu and uesugi and they are quite large , basically having everything between them sieged down . 
  i guess * some * africans can still be picked , but maybe someone needs a sub,

  the nazis even sent an expedition into tibet to find some kind of primal aryan . 
  the english were furious because tibet actually had closed borders and would not let anyone , accept a few english because it was their protectorate . 
  from a scientific legacy perspective this was actually a succesful mission as many animals and insects were caught , killed and preserved . 
  but they also took some human skulls back, 
  same in germany and austria, 
  you even know his slogan !,

  you were perfectly safe as my tributary and had all of arabia ( excluding hejaz ) as room for expansion !, 
  ** timurids ** countless of hours of plotting just to be betrayed by oman and malwa !, 
  the delhi forts prevented my hordes from helping bahmanis and bengal against jaunpur , malwa , vijayanagar and delhi . 
  bengal was the war leader on our side , crashed , many other people desynced so there was a rehost . 
  but what is this ? 
  i say bengal is coming and we start anyway ? 
  an eight ( 8 ) player war where one side 's warleader is ai controlled ? 
  thanks . 
  99 % war score vs oman and bengal seperate peaces for war reparations . 
  delhi completely sieged down and nothing happens . 
  bahmanis and bengal got completely mutilated and i seperate peaced for war reparations and ending my alliances . 
  then a spiral of events without options tanked my horde unity down to 20 , so i had to deal with separatist movements . 
  declared some wars on neighbours to give the hordes something to loot . 
  then came the big war in the west versus the black sheeps aka qara qoyunlu . 
  called my former tributary georgia in the war because loyalty shall be rewarded ( you hear that , former tributary oman ? ) . 
  secured the remaining trade centres and estuaries in persia . 
  now the truces with india have run out but no one in india is left to oppose the massive alliance , so maybe i 'll culture convert to persia .

   we need a strong europe and it 's important that we ( germany ) have the leading the role no one says that though ? 
  and until 2008 germany was very happy not leading at all and then got pressured to do stuff , did so reluctantly and then everyone complained . 
  and what 's wrong in looking for the benefit of it 's people ? 
  literally everyone does that in the eu and germany actually has the proportionally least power in the eu, 
  according to some surveys its like ~ 10 % who do it for both , probably mostly elderly or people  45, 
   go to greece for nice people not my post 2008 experience : q, 
  i think it 's been a problem for a while now , some cities basically lose their population because housing prices become unaffordable due to rich foreigners buying a vacation home and hoteliers buying any plot of land they can get their hands on and living quality is shittier because the tourists flood the streets, 
  it 's basically a mountain basin, 
  eh it 's kinda true though but the brits copied us and now seem to do it more than we do, 
  and other countries encourage people to get solar panels which get into the regular grid by giving tax cuts or similar stuff, 
  maybe you made your houses more energy efficient over time , plus cars got better, 
  you 're polluting germanies and sweden 's airspace ?? 
  who else are you polluting ? 
  yes but 2011 50 % of the active nuclear power plants were shut down at once with the others following until 2022, 
  the discrepancy between the amount of flack we get vs the actual change is just ridiculous , plus i guess we need a few more years of data as this only goes to 2013 and we `` shut them off '' in 2011, 
  aah reminds me of when nigel farage blamed germany for polluting uk cities ' air, 
  whats the point of solar panels if you cant feed the electricity into the grid ? 
  who the fuck can tax the sun ? 
  spanish government bribed by the energy companies apparently, 
  normies get out, 
  you see that big spike when we `` shut down '' nuclear plants ? 
  me neither, 
  no its because we were n't one country before and sources from the east are hard to get i 'm actually surprised that it turned to colour so early as we had our population census kinda separated until 2011 iirc or i might misremember something edit : probably the same reason for czechia and slovakia, 
  that 's more referred to as a bed though, 
  would have also helped if the soviets had just sent materials and not nkvd, 
  this is n't about winning lol wtf, 
  what ? 
  `` d\u00f6ner mit alles '' or get out,

  eeeh, 
  6/10 - not bad , had it 's moments, 
  where 's yours ? 
  : thinking :, 
  for some time ignored a lot more as well, 
  dutch were kinda considered germans back then and i think the adendum `` deutscher nation '' came after italy was no longer part of it, 
  [ who would win ? 
  ] ( https://pics.me.me/who-would-win-literally-going-an-impenetrable-fortification-armed-to-21469656.png ), 
  oh i misunderstood it apparently , i thought it was about the british starting to bomb civilians, 
  `` heiliges r\u00f6misches reich deutscher nation '' since the 15th century, 
  i know, 
  or one less country to choose from between north korea and x, 
  maybe a bot escaped from r/subredditsimulator, 
  was so succesful that even other countries adopted it,
