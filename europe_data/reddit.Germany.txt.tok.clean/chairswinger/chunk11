  lol @ the denazification , the forced denazification was basically fruitless . 
  the effects can still be sen today , as the first post-war generation in the western part was disgusted by the denial of their preceding generation and started demonstrating which then lead to the real reappraisal . 
  in the authoritarian gdr this was not possible so there was no genuine denazification , only the forced one , which is why today most rightwingers can be found in the east of germany,
