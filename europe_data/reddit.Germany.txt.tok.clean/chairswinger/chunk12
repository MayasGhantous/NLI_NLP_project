  during the massive war i kept my country mostly out of the war , sent a small force of condottieri to help , at the start they were 1-2mil techs behind , 0bonus discipline or morale , basically just peasants to bolster the ranks . 
  got stackwiped somewhere in berlin , poor fellas . 
  all vassals and marches are loyal now , took over the rest of bulgaria , brought economy back up , moved trade port to the baltic sea and redirected my merchants . 
  : ddddddddddddd, 
  dunno lol , but we basically combatted unemployment by introducing 1 $ jobs . 
  we just have introduced minimum wage very recently , and it 's kinda low given the economic standing . 
  it 's around 8 $ . 
  wages have also barely kept up with inflation in the last decades , so basically every economist is yelling that it 's time to increase wages but there seems to be little political will and companies are , of course , profit oriented and always threaten to lay off people or move elsewhere . 
  you do n't know [ the hoff ??? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztidn2dbyby&amp;ab_channel=davidhasselhoffvevo ) basically actor and singer , played in the original baywatch and knight rider , one of the biggest stars of the 80 's i think , was extraordinarily popular in germany for some reason , showed up during the fall of the wall . 
  then his career came to a halt and he had drug and alcohol problems but it looks he got back on track . 
  [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_hasselhoff ), 
  the kohl one is giving him too much credit , [ we all know who really did it ] ( http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/msnbc/components/video/__new/x_lon_hoff_141219.jpg ), 
  damn , missed chance right there, 
  til, 
  our wages are pretty low, 
  they sell vodka in crates like beer, 
  eu has more red white and blue countries than the uk , checkmate may, 
  i think at least 1 of them is banned , too , but too lazy to find out now, 
  eu4 and muslims , but they have a designated shitposting channel, 
  [ remember the 2016 amok run in munich ? 
  ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/ungluecke/diskussion-ueber-killer-computerspiele-nach-amoklauf-in-muenchen-14355353.html ) oh and btw that was the first time i agreed with him on something , still biting my ass we got him as minister of education now, 
  so basically our laws, 
  muh right to deny holocaust, 
  not anymore , law got abolished, 
  i think un vetoes should be abolished, 
  who hates greenpeace lol , got them mixed up with peta ? 
  tourists , retired people or both ? 
  but how is babby formed ?? 
  sometimes it feels like half of portugal is in france / [ luxembourg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_luxembourg#foreign_population_in_luxembourg ) / west germany, 
  [ how many of these would you count as 3rd world ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#foreign_nationals_in_germany ), 
  happy cake day, 
  ask france or us , they are the surrendermonkeys and we are the nazis, 
  someone analyzed this is school, 
  for some time it included basically all of italy , one emperor came from sicily or naples even, 
  it 's not like they are n't prosecuted in germany, 
  nope . 
  they still go with the games cause violence trope, 
  so why did n't that happen when we accepted millions of turks or italians in the 50 's / 60 's ? 
  turns out their birthrate approximated the national average, 
  a common fund , obvisouly due to geography most refugees will still land in greece/spain/italy . 
  eu finances the asylum centres and maybe sends equipment/employees there to help . 
  refugees then get redistributed across the eu , according to gdp/population/area and if a family member is already present , send them there . 
  ah yes , because the turks have shown exactly that : demographic overtaking ... not . 
  2nd generation immigrants have around the same birthrate as the natives , this is n't just a german phenomenon but can be observed in other countries as well, 
  germany has a list of save countries of return , some new entries on the list are controversial , among them afghanistan for obvious reasons, 
  dublin agreement was/is one of the biggest shames in eu history, 
  or that, 
  i really hate this slippery slope argument . 
  we had these laws for what , 70years now ? 
  look how much we turned into a totalitarian shithole, 
  same reaction when seeing norwegian food !, 
  depends on the language , in english they would probably butcher it into yu - ro - pa ( or poors probably ) , in german it 's more of a oi - ro - pa, 
  it 's always astounding how many people do n't know christians , muslims and jews all believe in the same god, 
  something like in apocalypse now just not wagner but schiller/beethoven, 
  merkel and kohl were bitter enemies during the corruption debacle, 
  the sun is really inflicting terror on europe these days, 
  describes my russian friends ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ? 
  the sharp minded is actually misplaced , that 's said about italians . 
  it 's something like `` witty '' for the germans there , still positive , of course . 
  i was more referring to the post-brexit racism after the referendum , stuff like [ this ] ( https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/984d/production/_90098983_untitled-1.jpg ) , especially poles were targeted, 
  aah makes more sense . 
  that abstention , though, 
  wow that 's a big boy, 
  well , no more * dirty poles or romanians *, 
  or trying to remove democracy and object geneva convention, 
  it 's more like `` wonderful '', 
  mistranslation , though i got ta admit it 's really hard to read . 
  traits is `` unerkenntlich '' which means something like obscure , for sciences it says `` freie k\u00fcnste '' - * liberal arts *, 
  good effort with the translations , but contains some mistakes , like the spaniard 's death is n't in a boat , but in bed ( maybe alluding to too much lovemaking ? ), 
  it 's written by germans , some slight bias may be at hand here, 
  wtf, 
  if you keep being unhappy like this it wo n't change !, 
  tbh there are natives that could use these courses as well, 
  i just wanted to show the irony in his thinking, 
  used party funds to pay off personal debts, 
  so eastern europeans and balkan people are subhumans , you 'd say ? 
  because that 's what our crime statistics show, 
  so what 's the best culture then ? 
  because maybe all humans are equal ? 
  black zero though, 
  that 's a really credible source, 
  you 're right, 
  nah that 's switzerland, 
  do n't feel sad , look at ireland, 
  blame mercator maps, 
  who would even like being belgian ? 
  on the plus side , you can now do the cross bridge challenge which was impossible before, 
  you should listen to more rise against , they are great, 
  ye the eurofighters are an absolute shame, 
  not our fault they glorify their past \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af could also include sweden though they seem to do their homework now, 
  protect us from who lol , all our neighbours are friends . 
  you 're absolutely right , another upcoming problem could be communications since many regiments have n't been updated in that regard since the 70 's . 
  maybe the title was more about potential, 
  the reasons for japans attack on hawaii were economical since it did n't have access to resources ( like oil and rubber ) and the usa were blockading , so they figured striking preemptively while taking the pacific islands is the best chance, 
  they should n't have gone to any post-wwii conflict yet they did , and fucked up every single one , so i guess the criticism is justified, 
  would n't that also hit canada or are there no natives living there ? 
  tsunami in the north pole goddamn , whole village frozen probably, 
  state or city ?
