  coming from a dutch, 
  there are people wishing to be the iberian `` so poor '', 
  poland is just `` regular '' catholicism though, 
  we stopped buying print , so now quantity  quality, 
  oh come on , everything is a mess compared to switzerland, 
  clearly racist towards ee , balkans and certain other countries !, 
  spanish civil war, 
  maybe those problems are more represented in the italian part . 
  also , i 'm not sure there are actually considerable amounts of swiss leaving for [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_germany ) whereas germans generally like to leave for [ switzerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_immigration_to_switzerland ) someone from switzerland is probably better qualified to explain this, 
  work in switzerland , live in italy , there are swiss who can not afford to live in switzerland, 
  it 's a common joke or meme, 
  how can you live like that ? 
  my bus sometimes even comes 5 minutes too early which really aggravates me , i would have made it if it came on time !, 
  but with current weather , bicycle is better option anyway, 
  my thoughts exactly, 
  i think he tweeted it twice , got ridiculed both times and then corrected it, 
  merlot was among the wines i had , honestly i probably had the whole range already , my parents really like wine , red , ros\u00e9 and white and i tasted those from time to time , just not my thing . 
  merlot is actually my father 's favourite lol, 
  [ i am trash man ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/926/born_to_die.jpg ), 
  to me , red wine tastes like garbage, 
  prices vary , i think 10 $ was the cheapest , so 15 $ sounds `` reasonable '' in my region kebabs go for 2,50 $ -3,50 $, 
  swiss also pay around 10 $ / d\u00f6ner so there 's that, 
  guardian online and guardian print have different quality levels , i think guardian print is really good , among the best worldwide, 
  same goes for the visa holders for people from the countries targetted by the muslim ban , but that 's also not because of trump but because of the courts ruling against him , yet in both cases trump was furious, 
  the * legal immigrant * part ? 
  only targeting muslim majority countries , excluding the countries where the 9/11 conspirators came from , makes sense right ? 
  and you did n't even address the main point, 
  simple , everyone he does n't like is branded as illegal immigrant . 
  remember the refugee deal with australia ? 
  makes them all legal immigrants , but he slammed the deal as allowing illegal immigrants into the country . 
  he just does n't like brown people . 
  or remember the muslim ban ? 
  people with visas not being allowed to enter ? 
  you forgot your big brother, 
  it even has a shitposting channel !, 
  damn you , i wanted to submit this :d well seeing you did n't provide a translation , i 'll step in to farm some karma . 
   trump in brussels  ** `` the germans are evil , very evil '' **   at the meeting with the eu leaders , donald trump massively criticised germany . 
  the spiegel got the exact wording from participants . 
    us-president donald trump vehemently complained about the german trade balance surplus at the eu summit . 
  `` the germans are evil , very evil '' , said trump . 
  spiegel got this from participants of the summit . 
    further , he said : `` look at the millions of cars they sell in the usa . 
  terrible . 
  we will stop this . '', 
    at the summit , eu-commission president jean-claude juncker sided with the germans and objected trumps scolding . 
  free trade benefits everyone , said the commission president . 
  participants tell juncker made an effort to keep a polite tone but remained hard on his stance . 
    at the approximately one hour long meeting , trump first met with the president of the european council donald tusk and the european commission president jean-claude juncker , about 45 minutes later further discussion participants joined in , on eu side among others president of the european parliament antonio tajani and high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy federica mogherini ( goddamn , in german it 's just chefdiplomatin ) . 
    according to a report of the `` s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung '' , the europeans were appalled by how little the americans knew about trade policies . 
  apparently , the guests did not know that the eu countries only made trade deals together . 
  trump 's economic advisor gary cohn allegedly said that there are different customs tariffs between the usa and germany and the usa and belgium . 
    germany has been exporting more than importing for years . 
  trump had already previously made the german surpluses a topic , even before his inauguration the president had made critical remarks in an interview with the `` bild '' . 
  back then his main issue were german cars on new york streets : `` i would tell bmw , if they want to build a manufactory in mexico and sell cars in the usa without a 35 % tariff , they can forget it . 
  since then the threat of a penalty tax is in the room . 
    the new us-president perceives the german surpluses as unfair because they cause deficits elsewhere , he is especially thinking about the usa . 
  the german government is also under pressure within the eu because of the trade surpluses . 
  in a recent interview with `` spiegel '' the federal financial minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble ( cdu ) had said as well that the surplus is too high . 
    originally the eu thought , after countless meetings of european country leaders and trump and several explanation attempts about international trade policy they would be a step further . 
  the europeans can now safely bury that hope . 
  sorry for bad english, 
  so like xxxl ?
