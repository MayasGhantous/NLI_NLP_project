  relevant username, 
  i 'm jealous, 
  ok did a bit more research . 
  the duke of saxony sells friesland to burgundian netherlands . 
  ( 1515 ) end of the schmalkaldic war , defeat for the protestants , the wettin dynasty comes into power in saxony . 
  true that, 
  well it 's half on the american plate, 
  somewhere in the 30 's for very short time iirc, 
  in the gdr , women had way more rights and were expected to do more than in the west , which was kinda ingrained in their culture , so after the wall fell , many women looked for jobs , and did n't find any in the east . 
  also , in the gdr it was not encouraged to found companies which also has a legacy of lethargy in some eastern germans . 
  upboated retroactively, 
  maybe you 'll understand the occasional doggerland or future netherlands joke now, 
  that cathedral is really leaving it 's mark on the cityview . 
  looks regular sized until you compare it to the buildings next to it, 
  you sure you do n't have some german in you ? 
  or bananas, 
  it 's great , i 'm jealous, 
  most were great but i felt for some there could have been better choices . 
  still , high effort post, 
  i find this obsession over genetic strings fascinating , could be straight out of the nuremberg laws, 
  this is a nazi thread, 
  that 's not the point , to be below the uk is utter humiliation, 
  they 'll get the same treatment, 
  oh lol i hadnt zoomed in , it zooms in quite far, 
  nothing has happened and already everyone is hating on germany again :'), 
  ca n't spot the flag , where is it ? 
  not sure why downvoted , from what i gathered pis is trying to emulate orban, 
  just a summer residence though , nothing special ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  they do n't really , though , even with these interest rates people still ca n't get a loan to found a company, 
  has the power to halt all intercontinental flight between america and europe, 
  ( i was n't really serious ), 
  we do n't put our children in [ cellars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marc_dutroux ), 
  germany and netherlands below belgium wtf ? 
  honestly i 'd much prefer going to pre-2008 when we did nothing , but if stuff like eurobonds etc should get introduced hell yeah i want equal representation, 
  not really , but for example buying stocks might be better than simply letting the money rot in the bank, 
  spain too , unless you cut yourself off the grid, 
  why is my voice worth the least then ? 
  is a luxembourger or maltese 10x more competent , worthy or better than i ? 
  the average german already has resentment against draghis policies because germans for the love of god do n't make investments , we are a people of savers , it 's irrational currently to put money in the bank because you 're losing money , but we do it anyway . 
  that 's not a bad thing, 
   spain has a population of 46 million , is one of the biggest economies in europe and also one of the fastest growing economies so they deserve to have a bigger voice than all eastern countries put together . 
  careful there , thats one thing germans get accused of constantly here despite it being not true , only 1 vote in council and proportionally least seats in parliament, 
  yeah i guess you 're right , 10secs of googling could have prevented me from spreading false information, 
  goddamn austria , i thought you were safe for now, 
  or just put palina rojinski there , probably does n't even need to sing for us to get a single digit place :d, 
  i do n't think he wants to be affiliated with this whole ordeal :d though given his musical exploration in the past 2 years he would n't be bad for the job i guess ( and certainly not worse than the current ones ), 
  to add on this , `` kamerad '' is n't really equivalent to `` comrade '' . 
  `` kamerad '' has military connotations to it , the socialist movements referred to each other as `` genosse '' , for which there is no real word in english , thus both get translated to `` comrade '' . 
   edit : i meant d\u00f6ner kebab , please like the comment of u/chairswinger who corrected me  no vote manipulation !, 
  impressive skills you got there !, 
  `` economic anxiety '', 
  iirc d\u00f6ner just means the meat on the skewer , and the whole ordeal d\u00f6ner kebab, 
  ndr apparently, 
  what ? 
  i 'm for the other direction !, 
  make wraclaw breslau again !, 
  i mean , that 's kinda sad , the greens actively campaigned against stuttgart 21 , then got elected and then a plebiscite decided in favour of stuttgart 21 , so they are forced to bring something through they are against, 
  or going completely against green ideology , in case with car producers for example, 
  or make a cdu/csu thing out of it , i would n't like getting rid of the 5 %, 
  and that from a country that sent [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpzx7ezifd0&amp;ab_channel=quent1991 ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gl37zfo1po&amp;ab_channel=2000esc2003 ) ( which only barely defeated [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zh86ufaaum&amp;ab_channel=davidknott ) in the pre-election ) . 
  there 's a [ reason ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a7qxptwilo&amp;ab_channel=robi42xtreme ) we call stefan raab `` mr. euovision '' or `` mr. entertainment '' . 
  it really hurt when he retired . 
  edit : plus , you greeks also liked to send fun things to esc and now this pop song ( at least it was better than ours , not a blatantly obvious david guetta rip-off ), 
  well there are reasons bundesgr\u00fcne called for `` excommunication '' of kretschmann , bw-gr\u00fcne seem to be really conservative, 
  ye but it would be more fun if the songs were n't so bland , germany just sends a pretty girl with a 08/15 pop song to esc ever since raab left . 
  and to make things worse : the song gets decided first , and then the singers have to compete against each other , all with the same song ... what ? 
  well fdp are basically a cdu extension anyway , there 's no other coalition partner for them, 
  for some people , that 's a lot , it hinders social mobility, 
  and what about the kids after 15years ? 
  do they not deserve equal chances as well ? 
  i 'm not only thinking about myself , you know ? 
  i think every human with the appropriate qualifications should be able to attend university if he or she wishes to do so , and not be barred by fees which their family ca n't afford, 
  nah it 's ok , maybe the people responsible will soon realise their current pre-esc selection model does n't work ( hint : they wo n't ), 
  actually this is terrible ... oh , you 're csu voter, 
  nothing , really , just big slander campaigns by cdu and lack of clear marketing on their own part, 
  no , nrw cdu is full of idiots and they want to reintroduce student fees, 
  could have made the help bound by residence , if they leave they do n't get any money \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  ha , suck it spain !, 
  not even close bby, 
  so , false flag `` terrorism '' ? 
  pretty sure it 's referring to germany but we can share the memes, 
  no new reports so far but italians were turkish level, 
  could also be russian immigrants, 
  does n't count in tourism, 
  did you know the immigrants from spain and italy are among the least educated in germany ? 
  i thought you lost your identity when the communists killed all your intellectuals and those they did not , fled ? 
  it 's perfectly reasonable to establish laws concerning kleingardening and enforce them , for example if your hedge has grown too high !, 
  probably same for everyone in the same climate, 
  anglophones are weird, 
  nothing special but today i prepared myself some penne with a champignon pan . 
  * pour oil in pan and preheat a little * cut onions and leek and put into pan * boil water * prepare champignons ( used ~ 450g ) and put into the rest of the pan . 
  put pan on maximum for 2-3mins and then close to lowest * add salt to water , when it boils put in the penne * i also cut a tomato and added it to the pan * 1 clove of garlic cut into the pan * poured a little milk into the pan and cracked 2 eggs into it , scrambled it all * after some time , poured some cream into pan and added salt and pepper , put the pan on maximum for 1min and sieved the pot with water and penne * basically finished , made myself 3 servings , after the first i gave the rest of the penne into the pan to reheat * sorry for extreme vagueness, 
  it 's actually a big business in germany , especially loved by people going on festivals , basically every supermarket has at least one row full of cans, 
  most our states and cities and counties are heavily indebted , only the federal level has money, 
  i mean if either one of us is right it 's poorly drawn , no matter what . 
  i thought it was maybe the thames estuary and wider area, 
  pretty sure thats south east england, 
  around of 20 % of germans are of foreign origin , it 's the country with the 2nd most immigration after the usa in nominal terms and it 's still doing fine , our latest economic growth can be attributed to this because of the larger consumerbase, 
  we had n't had real income raises for like 1-2decades, 
  you mean ** true ** i presume :p,
