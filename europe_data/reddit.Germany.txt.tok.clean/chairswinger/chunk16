  like a royal marriage ? 
  more the burning bridges part , but voting to not want to stick to others is also kinda not well perceived in those others, 
  special treatment, 
  cameron would be one of the more recent examples, 
  buncha try hards !, 
  ah yes ok, 
  he can do it himself, 
  not sure what you count as rich , but the people with a 2,5 k monthly income here still buy potatoes and going to a restaurant is more of a special occasion thing, 
  swedes also come to germany , depends where they live, 
  [ the only appropriate action !,

  countless special treaties and vetoes, 
  cameron tried something similar and look where that got him, 
  you have to remember they do n't rule alone , they are in a coalition , which does n't benefit the spd as basically everything gets credited to the cdu, 
  [ please everyone ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/583/043/800.png ), 
  excuses !, 
  from what i understand , other countries encourage their population installing solar panels on their own houses for self-consumption with either investment help or some cuts , in spain you have to pay the same amount as any other consumer and on top of that even a tax for daring to produce energy on your own, 
  norway and finland just despicable ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  uh was n't it something like your government is actually against those on roofs ? 
  like a sun tax or something ? 
  20 zloty are 20 zloty, 
  die linke needs to get their shit together , though , sometimes it feels half their members are lunatics , especially on higher levels, 
  such a shame really , any video about history or germany or sweden or pagan/folk music/metal really gets flooded by the biggest shitstains this planet has to offer, 
  rightful german clay !, 
  look at these old documents i just found !,

  but , then again , it 's on `` steal this album ! '', 
  i have no idea about hebrew schwas , i just meant the [ ipa schwa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwa ), 
  we did it on r/place !, 
  would it help to dissect the word ? 
  kurz ( short ) ge - ( prefix ) sagt ( said ), 
  it 's more of a schwa then a full pronounciation of the `` ge '', 
  could have pointed out that they invaded neutral countries to prevent nazis getting there , though iceland did n't mind from what i 've heard , and did n't declare war on the soviet union after they attacked their allies poland and finland . 
  more than to czechia lulul, 
  holy shit they finally finished and opened it ? 
  ber when ? 
  yeah i think italians and germans have a different view on the reasons for unification, 
  butter is better for stuff like chicken , eggs , and maritime creatures,

  russians celebrate tomorrow right ?

  cdu is cancer though, 
  there even is a danish minority party in schleswig-holstein which also gets votes from non-danes , more [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_schleswig_voters%27_association ) ( english article is shit , read in german if you can , danish seems decent ),

  wanted to say the video is better with the sound turned off , but then it was just mostly sequences of her so not even that really helps . 
  only took her 25secs to get to her main point . 
  this is weird , usually hungary and estonia are odd and now they are not ?

  would n't german make more sense because it 's more precise ? 
  no one learns german :(, 
  nothing of our foolery will ever come close to brexit : ^ ), 
  yeah greece should just be more competitive as well , how about bulgaria becomes more competitive as well ? 
  all those poor countries should just * be more competitive *, 
  i think you misunderstood me , i meant that poland , belarus and ukraine all suffered the most under germany in wwii, 
  yeah , there is no denying that germany did horrible things during wwii and poland took the brunt alongside with belorussia and ukraine . 
  was really sad to find out that most of the buildings i saw in warsaw were only reconstructions . 
  well i literally only read the wikipedia article, 
  yeah , same with other places , but in the case of warsaw the soviets can also take some blame , instead of intervening they waited because they did n't want polish dissidents , much easier way of getting rid of them,

  yeah especially bridges so the allies could n't cross , but most people were against that, 
  germany had also planted explosives all across paris during wwii , but i ca n't remember whether they decided against blowing it up or the command was given but the local leaders disobeyed . 
  [ best feeling ... wait a sec ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/5fqi88/i_finally_got_the_mare_nostrum_achievement/ ), 
  but she is n't the only one who wants that , right ? 
  i mean , last time i was in france all the price tags still had both currencies, 
  you 're still a reich in german < 3, 
  even if that were true , i suppose the other eu countries would have a problem if the uk gets a debt cut because germany got a debt cut, 
  german debt = / = eu debt because germany = / = eu, 
  is there a plant that spreads faster than dandelions ?
