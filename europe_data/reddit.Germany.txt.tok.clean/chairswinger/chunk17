  everyone knows belgian , czech and german beer is the best  as for the lack of acknowledgement : i grew up 50km from the dutch border , and now live ~ 80km from the belgian/french border so my contact with czech people has been very limited , but i heard people form saxony or bavaria have more contact so they probably would have had something to say,

  everyone did tbh , it was a self-fulfilling prophecy , everyone mistrusted everyone , built up their forces so they 'd mistrust each other more, 
  they were germans until 1945 , there was support for austrians to join the german empire but it was basically hohenzollern vs habsburgs and austria would have had to let go of all the non-german territories,

  because you 're the scrotum , east sweden, 
  what do you want from me ? 
  my personal opinion or that i transform into a legal expert ? 
  we do n't need a reason to allow restaurants to stay open on sundays . 
  this is `` drugs are n't allowed because they are illegal '' - germany . 
  the laws concerning sundays are n't made on federal level , they are made state wise and vary from state to state . 
  i now took some more time to read through * my * states laws concerning this and i see no problem . 
  here is a brief translation , ( here the [ source ] ( https://recht.nrw.de/lmi/owa/br_text_anzeigen?v_id=10000000000000000525 ) for anyone fluent in german ) * the law serves to protect the rest of sundays and holidays * the law affects points of sale and the commercial offering of wares outside of outlets . 
  * on sundays and holidays the following points of sale may operate : points of sale , whose main assortment consists of one or more of the following ware groups : flowers and plants , newspapers and magazines , and bakery products , but only for five hours ( so basically kiosks , flowershops and bakeries , got any questions why these are allowed to open on sundays or need an explanation ? ) . 
  points of sale ( horrible translation , but there seems to be no better word for * verkaufsstellen * other than outlet maybe ) which sell thematic products or wares to be consumed instantly in the area of a cultural or sports event or inside a museum during opening hours , if it serves to supply the visitors . 
  agricultural businesses to sell self-produced agricultural products , only for 5h . 
  perishable wares and wares to be instantly consumed may be sold outside of places of sale . 
  should the 24th of december fall on a sunday , points of sale that predominantly sell groceries and points of sale for christmas trees may be opened from 10am-2pm * on a maximum of 4 national holidays points of sale are allowed to open for maximum of 5h on occasion of a local festivity or market * pharmacies may sell medicaments and baby products , the pharmacy organisation makes sure only a share of pharmacies is opened , the pharmacies alternate * gas stations are allowed to have opened 24/7 , but on sundays and holidays and saturdays after 10pm only spare parts for conservation or restoration of the driving capability , fuel and `` travel needs '' are allowed to be sold * places of sale in airports and train stations may sell travel needs on sundas and holidays , in international airports even regular groceries may be sold * the state office reserves the right to make exceptions in the public interest . 
  it is beneficial for a society to have a common day off , while not everyone has this day off , the vast majority does and can go do recreational stuff like go to a museum , go to a restaurant with the family , go play mini golf and buy some refreshments there , buy today 's newspaper to have something to read while you take the train to visit someone , go eat some ice cream and so on, 
  people go buy their shit on friday or saturday and plan ahead . 
  the only thing i could find in a few minutes of google research is that it 's allowed for the aforementioned , without any reasoning , and that there are `` exceptions in public interest '', 
  restaurants can choose on which day they have their free day , most use the monday because everyone has free on sunday so maybe goes out to eat in a restaurant . 
  gas stations are open 24/7 but only have a bare minimum in stock and it basically costs double or triple than in regular grocery stores . 
  i think the real triggering part was the * slav * , as romanians see themselves as romance/latin ( which certainly has scientific backing ), 
  you do n't know heino ? 
  r/mapswithoutportugal is to blame, 
  would n't call this being `` behind '' , just a different approach to society , restaurants and gas stations are still open , so you wo n't starve,
