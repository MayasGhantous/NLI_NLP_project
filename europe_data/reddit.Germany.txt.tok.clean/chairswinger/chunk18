  thank you for your service o7, 
  [ this is babymetal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wikqge4bway&amp;ab_channel=babymetalofficial ) , they spawned a whole new genre , the most prominent immitators being [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8-vje-bq9c&amp;ab_channel=ladybaby ), 
   mesut * \u00d6 * zil op   better germany it 's war , then, 
  from german propaganda point of view , uk should have stayed neutral or even allied with germany because of the same royal family . 
  ( also , germany asked russia to stay neutral , france to stay neutral , asked belgium for passage , but they all declined ), 
  germany also used/uses it because of wwi, 
  i 'm intrigued , can we share our non-existing plans ? 
  rude !, 
  do n't listen to that sagerusta guy , he 's only spewing racist bullshit, 
  they did n't even bother with albania, 
  you should put out more !!, 
  i heard one factor is that it 's far more common for people to live with their parents past the age of 30, 
  this looks like nuts 3 already, 
  in summer they can get brown instead of red !!, 
  by that logic germany should have been overrun by muslims now , the 2nd generation usually stops having more than 2 kids, 
  one day a post with this title will be about crop yield, 
  probably the latter , german police still has n't released a police report of 2016 for example, 
  currently we need around 600k immigrants/year to sustain the population, 
  sad . 
  me neither but i 'm loving it , especially the incorporation of the history of japan vid on the sidemap, 
  come on , so many to choose from and you decide to shitpost !, 
  based brittany ( and corse ), 
  also , only forced denazification which also had little to no effect in western germany , it took the first post-war generation to rebel in the west to start working on our past , which did n't happen in the autocratic east, 
  sometimes i agreed with multiple statements , this was harder than expected :( ( got merkel btw , fuck ), 
  something tells me op left that out on purpose to bamboozle, 
  well it 's designed so narrow so no sword duels could be made, 
  germany is clear but what 's the 2nd ? 
  dutch flag half poll ? 
  i ca n't quite make out the one between italy and uk though, 
  sometimes i really like france and then i remember a large portion of their population are fucking racists, 
  is it wrong that i think the choking is probably the 2nd weirdest part of her ? 
  after eating glue, 
  was n't that also the factory that completely stopped orders for anyone else other than tesla ? 
  could be that it 's more of a western european thing , i 've heard many french and germans refer to him as that, 
  uuuh , neither are they in france ? 
  that 's also not what i meant , and even then : wtf ? 
  what i was implying was that uk , leaving the eu , is a far bigger problem than any france is having . 
  also , learn how to spell deutschland, 
  i know that , it 's not what i meant, 
   and tommy 's problems are small compared to france you lost me there, 
  black people have all the right in the world to proclaim they are german if they have german citizenship , [ this ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=antonio+r%c3%bcdiger&amp;rlz=1c1teua_ende453de453&amp;espv=2&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjyxkv5t67tahvkepokhdh8a2gq_auibyga&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662&amp;dpr=1 ) fella is definitely german . 
  islam was entrenched in large parts of europe , it 's influence can still be seen in southern spain and sicily, 
  usually phone calls , there are companies specialised in these kinds of polls , i have a company call me every 3-6 months on various topics , sometimes music in radio and they play some song snippets and i have to rate them in different categories , after the call they ask if they may call again sometime, 
  expected it to be much worse , so i 'm ok with this, 
  this is gon na stir some shit, 
  how high was it ? 
  they also have some whales on one of the coins, 
  pula is nice though, 
  quality metashitpost, 
  shame, 
  we are lucky if eu elections have a 40 % turnout , so it 's not just a turkish problem, 
  been a while since you last asked, 
  you do n't understand , christianity is all about forgiving !!, 
  shame, 
  it 's really flawed though , you could take germany 's 1:1 , we 're a federal republic as well, 
  eh , c\u00f6lln already was residence of the prince-elector towards the end of the 15th century , but yeah it was n't really significant , hence my doubts . 
  but u/iwanttosaysmth already [ revealed ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65f1ti/maps_of_europe_europa_regina_16th_century/dgag243/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) what is meant here, 
  reich just means * realm * in that context, 
  i think a constitution should be updated every now and then , theirs is almost 250 years old with few amends, 
  also , all the nazi comparisons , that shit do n't fly with us, 
  if it 's any consolidation , it 's about government, 
  but the point that people have been saying that since early civilisation still stands then, 
  which is why it gets me everytime , keulen is a synonym for masturbating in german ( reflexive , * sich einen keulen * ), 
  nah gdansk is danticum next to prussia, 
  germany boobs confirmed . 
  but which city is megapolis supposed to represent ? 
   the children now love luxury . 
  they have bad manners , contempt for authority ; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise . 
  that 's sad, 
  keulen gets me everytime, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3uwk5i/the_migratory_pole/ ), 
  are n't they almost already ? 
  44 % foreigners, 
  wait is n't today about nailing jesus ? 
  atheism is one of the few good things we got ~ ~ from the soviet times ~ ~ . 
  ftfy, 
  urge to purge, 
  you wish, 
  we have luxembourg between us, 
  germanians were like `` get out of my swamp ! '', 
  [ excuse me ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/france_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) never had zero points , and [ spain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spain_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) is mostly getting double digits as well, 
  wtf greens , you ought to vote the other side, 
  not sure that would help, 
  most of our states and cities are heavily indebted , only the federal level is somewhat rich, 
  * do n't click `` show comments '' , do n't click `` show comments '' * dammit, 
  could be renewable energy projects or agriculture subsidies, 
  the alcohol prices are outrage * ou * s , now i get the great migrations to swedish and estonian stores, 
  oh wow [ you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) managed to be last more often than [ us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany_in_the_eurovision_song_contest ) !, 
  though also 1 more win . 
  but when you qualify you tend to get way more points than us, 
  [ come ooooooooon !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zh86ufaaum&amp;ab_channel=davidknott ), 
  something something georgia, 
  italy also reentered after a long break, 
  we got a few loans and * gastarbeiter *, 
  should they fail probably gon na be hard to get back in , should they not fail , no reason for them to get back in ( unless they massively change their minds about being european and free travel and what not ), 
  not that i 'm aware of , but there 's still time , and germany `` is still ruling the eu with an iron fist and harbouring millions of refugees '' so i guess we wo n't get more than 40points, 
  oh hey , now i know who the contestant for germany is . 
  edit : wow sounds a lot like titanium by david guetta germany also once had something similar i think , when stefan raab was the main organiser for the germans,
