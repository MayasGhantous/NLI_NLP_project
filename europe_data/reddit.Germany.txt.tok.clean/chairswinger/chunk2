  but the eu started with the ecsc between just france and germany, 
  we are already letting belgium into our flag and spain on the right side of the eu using the bottom 2 bars of the german one , come to r/placede and our discord but i do n't think this will find approval, 
  yes you 're right , we also identified german attackers on our discord , they basically do it to troll/spite the rest of us ninja edit : when everyone is awake again , operation cleanup shall commence, 
  i heard someone in the german discord was working on one , maybe we have one tomorrow, 
  french are also using scripts , especially for the color white, 
  fucking french keep attacking the eu flag , as if us germans were n't busy enough with repelling the void, 
  no reason to go and kill nepal in frustration !, 
  both eu flags under attack , too , sorry occupied there, 
  so cleaning order * red * black * white * yellow, 
  more like france vs germany , the french are constantly trying to sabotage the [ eu flag ] ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/297511377843519498/297854926229471242/palns.png ) # now they 're running a script to turn the centre white again, 
  nah they 're making a border around the eu flag now , the rainbow splits in half , one goes `` north '' the other `` south '', 
  dunno lol their admin came to us :d found it , on the sidebar of their sub , [ this ] ( https://discordapp.com/invite/wmjfv32 ) worked for me, 
  focus on the left and upper side , rainbowroad said theyre gon na do the rest of the stars for us , would suggest using the coordinates but adding 1 in length to the stars, 
  the plan was to go under the crosssection , bounce off bitcoin and then go over the germanflag , bounce off the happy birthday and go under german flag again , but while discussing the road already went over the crossing, 
  oh you repelled austria, 
  on the french sub they decided against eu flag : /, 
  in the replay you can actually see when the annexation post hit r/all , us germans mostly tried to defend the french flag and when it became futile helped move up, 
  we just discussed with rainbowroad on discord , but seems hivemind is stronger than leadership , we might have to let them cross through and clean up later edit : a few plans , [ 1 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/igsi4 ) [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cbvzten.png ) , [ 3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3sfyhig.png ) ; would personally advocate for 3 edit 2 : go for 3 , use the coordinates of 1 and extend the stars by 1, 
  ca n't find you and , besides , [ we 're being attacked by nato members ] ( https://i.imgur.com/zdgwnyc.jpg ), 
  this, 
  just wan na say most of us germans tried defending the french flag , though this is funny to watch . 
  we also helped expand vertically and are trying to put a heart inbetween, 
  we folks from r/de actually helped them, 
  i blame r/all, 
  wheres the brasil flag gone ? 
  last time i saw it it had a 7:1 on it :d, 
  do n't drink and reddit, 
  nominativ ? 
  jobs which require higher education usually also require german knowledge , with few exceptions . 
  iirc he 's just quoting op 's text before it got edited out, 
  fewer trees , more concrete :( but the neighbouring streets are nice, 
  almost naked , even, 
  just tell fn voters to sign their ballot to avoid voter fraud, 
  mallorca is mostly for lower educated people though , same with lloret de mar, 
  you can always start a 4th republic ( i lost count , but it 's 3rd right now right ? ), 
  slovenia on the other hand ... 
  not english , but for me it 's simply \u00b4 ` ^ before a vowel to make like \u00e0 \u00e1 \u00e2, 
  at least 40 % came from syria in germany , 2nd and 3rd biggest were afghans and iraqis, 
  14h old account , 4 low effort troll posts , got ta try harder boi, 
  same in german lol , * aff\u00e4re * , can mean both though, 
  it 's not like they were oppressed or hindered to leave, 
  it 's because of the fast internet , german internet sucks ballz, 
  you ca n't call it freedom when you joined voluntarily and can decide when you leave, 
  because they have to follow like 90 % of eu rules , which brexit voters do not want, 
  this is n't an issue to at least 80 % of germans soo , tough luck, 
  i was a bit disappointed in the interviewer after  spiegel : yet poland clearly profits as well : new roads have been built , jobs have been created and agriculture is supported . 
    waszczykowski : of course the money is beneficial to us . 
  but who is building those roads ? 
  western european companies . 
  eighty cents of each euro that comes from brussels flows back to the west . 
  i would have asked why the contracts were n't given to polish companies then, 
  and poland exported stuff to other eu countries , granting access to an even bigger market . 
  [ interview ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/poland-foreign-minister-waszczykowski-interview-a-1140629.html ) , it 's right at the start, 
  you 'd be surprised , and also we are generous enough to not let all the states have summer holidays at the same time , its staggered , imagine if we 'd get holidays all at the same time !, 
  luxembourg got confused by who to buy from, 
  * now our exports are less competitive * or something, 
  k\u00f6lln flocken 4 life, 
  expat = white immigrant, 
  we prefer * schluchtenschei\u00dfer *, 
  your country was never occupied by the allies , though , we have a few tinfoilhats arguing they never gave the country back, 
  used more in context of birthdays, 
  basically everything remotely pro-german was used and bastardised by the nazis, 
  btw what are the 2 regions ? 
  one is in bavaria and the other one ? 
  or maybe those 2 regions are both in bavaria, 
  ca n't put a label on porn ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  if you give me your address i might even send a courier !, 
  i get so many turkish movie recommendations in my amazon prime lol, 
  both germanic people , for example , you will not notice any difference when crossing the borders , the villages look the same , except for the signs, 
  palestinians are also semites , checkmate zionists !, 
  german way of saying * cast into the shadowrealm *, 
  pretty sure germany has fewer tanks and more deployed troops , i read something about 5000 in afghanistan alone , and around 200 operational tanks , but my sources could have been outdated, 
  you 're honorary german now, 
  join us !, 
  you make our borders ugly, 
  glad it was n't up to you to decide, 
  12 years in office would say otherwise, 
  violet was mostly used for christian parties, 
  cdu is probably the most corrupt party in germany , completed with backwards thinking like rape in marriage does not exist, 
  is n't 2 speed europe really necessary for eastern europeans though ? 
  for catching up they need to go faster, 
  [ educate yourself next time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_armed_forces_casualties_in_afghanistan ), 
  and all the journalists shouting for a handshake in the occasion only used to take pictures of the leaders shaking hands ? 
  and we would gladly have them leave , they mostly cause trouble, 
  all european beaches belong to germany !, 
  not sure if it 's mostly germans ruining the autobahns , as it 's mostly trucks , and germany being pretty much in the centre of europe sees a lot of trucks crossing through . 
  i personally think the proposal is stupid as well and might even end up costing more than it brings back in due to bureaucracy , just said why the toll was proposed, 
  exactly, 
  this is exactly why the toll was proposed , other people ruining our streets, 
  sad that this needs government intervention to begin with , farmers are shooting in their own foot by using those pesticides, 
  they do n't even speak high-german !, 
  how many members do they have again ? 
  get way too much media attention, 
  i believe i have seen this one before , ages ago , so maybe it 's from before 2013 and symbols croatia trying to get in, 
  from my experience the worst offenders are people from anglophone countries though , they never learn, 
  now that 's a welcome change in rhetoric, 
  what 's also interesting to note is that in germany there is a joke that luxembourgish is basically moselle franconian but they renamed it because of political reasons, 
  i mean , on mediterranean beaches you have to be lucky if waves go higher than your knees , of course they can be quite high in the deep areas , but atlantic waves are on another level entirely, 
  call them differently , i mean those states are compromised of different regions and former duchies etc anyway . 
  in lower saxony are people very akin to westphalians but also many frisians , in sachsen-anhalt are ostfalen and thuringians , but i must admit i do n't know much about those states , so if anyone living there with better knowledge finds mistakes or has something valuable to add , feel free,
