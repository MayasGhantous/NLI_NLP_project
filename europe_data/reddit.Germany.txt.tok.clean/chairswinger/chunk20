  other than that not really . 
  not sure if this counts but we have 3 common washing machines in a house with like 80 tenants , cost 1,50 $ to use . 
  i wanted to do my laundry but all 3 were filled , but one was finished , so i wiped the washing machine with one of my clothes , it 's gon na get washed anyway , and started putting the content of the machine on top of it , pretty normal stuff , i 've seen other people do it and i 've done it before myself . 
  well , owner of those clothes walks in talking on her phone , sees me putting her clothes on top , says `` i 'll call you back '' and then goes on a 10 minute tirade how i 'm a filthy panty sniffing pig and that her clothes are ruined now and the least i could do is pay her 1,50 for another round in the machine , if not buy her new laundry and i was just standing there thinking `` is she for real ? '' . 
  packed my stuff and left , returned 3h later to do my laundry, 
  [ vasco da gama ] ( https://www.vascodagama.koeln/startseite.html ) in cologne . 
  as the name suggests , portuguese food . 
  prices are a bit high and there 's not a high variety on the menu , mostly meat , but the owner is just super charismatic and the meat is super tasty . 
  right now the centre of the eu is somewhere in northwestern poland so berlin would be the closest capital, 
  rhine in flames has a few dates in september , but that 's not your timeframe \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  he does n't have to believe in it , jews do the same, 
  multiple things , not just one . 
  * partitioning of poland * yugoslav war ( s ) * anything about asia , really, 
  who ? 
  we are n't the only ones that do it , but maybe we do it on the largest scale !, 
  but what else is there to do ? 
  you ca n't stay in water for hours so you dig a nice hole , has better sand for sand castles or kids that are too afraid of the sea can jump into the puddle emerging there and it 's kinda relaxing,

  depends on the implementation , i do n't want to be used as a credit card, 
  around 12 % of german tourists do indeed reserve their spot with a towel socks and sandals, 
  it 's ok , i was 19 and cried when we lost, 
  still salty, 
  would n't say we are not proud , we just hide it better, 
  yeah i mean almost every alcohol has the potential to kill people , but in the 19th century it was a real artist killer , many also mixed drugs into it which of course did n't help . 
  from a cost effectiveness point of view it 's kinda good though imo , you do n't need much to get drunk, 
  it was dangerous and killed lots of people in the 19th century , but now it 's safe, 
  i 'd say he is rather well liked though , introduced the potato, 
  your school must have sucked then, 
  friedrich the great is also responsible for the introduction of the potato into germany , for which i 'm ever grateful, 
  yes . 
  it 's a sketch by one of if not the greatest german comedian , but you need to be fluent in german and know the german way of life a bit to get most of them , though this one is quite universal ( nagging wife , how original i know but this one is good ), 
  * succesfully *, 
  romans get out of my swamp reeeeeeeeee, 
  absinthe is pretty great !, 
  i think fines can go up to 3000 $ for this , it 's one of the most stupid things you can do, 
  yes, 
  does n't work with every game , that was one of the first things i tried, 
  oh shit forgot about tony hawk , thps 2 was the shit , 3 and 4 were ok as well, 
  i 've spent several thousand hours playing warcraft 3 , dota2 , eu4 , total war series ( oh boy ) , mount and blade : warband , world of warcraft , hearthstone . 
  i of course really like age of empires 1 and 2 as well , enjoyed age of mythology and empire earth , settlers 3 and 4 , battle for middle earth ( both ) but also trackmania and the star wars pod racer game as well as lego racers . 
  ( of course , there were countless more games but these felt worth pointing out ) sadly , more and more games do n't work on newer operating systems , and even though gog.com can help with that , you pay for the same game twice and gog does n't have everything . 
  so frustrating when you wan na play an old game for a day , insert the disk and nothing works, 
  i like [ croatian kuna coins ] ( http://www.onlineforex.net/wp-content/uploads/croatian-kuna-coins.jpg ) with those animals, 
  personally , i would like it to be like germany , just with 1 layer on top, 
  there are cars for middle class as well , like opel and vw or some bmw models you know ? 
  actually some bmw models are more associated with lower class here, 
  austria is balkans , silly, 
  do n't really think about them , given our colonial adventures were rather limited . 
  namibia seems to do a little bit better than the average african country . 
  they even contributed to the `` america first , xxx 2nd '' trend earlier this [ year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npkdoev6vyo&amp;ab_channel=gondwanacollectionnamibia ) , was a fun watch, 
  tv in 2017 lul . 
  well depends on the channel . 
  we do n't really have this 24/7 news channel style ( i guess phoenix or n24 count , but they are more like hitler documentaries 24/7 ) . 
  the public statefunded broadcasters do n't have advertisements after 20:00 . 
  the news are condensed and pretty good quality . 
  the programme is more oriented at older people , with some really trashy shows like doctors in the alps and shit . 
  recently they introduced separate channels with more youth oriented shows , some of which copy us formats like john oliver or daily show . 
  the state funded broadcasters also have an `` educational mission '' so you 'll find many documentaries series there . 
  then there are private public broadcasters , lots of advertisements , often showing hollywood movies after 20:15 or casting shows , the rtl network probably being the worst of them , do n't talk to people who watch rtl on the regular , though their shows do have great meme potential . 
  then we have the pay tv channels like sky ( obligatory for football ) and netflix ( still in their babysteps ) . 
  i think the german dubbing industry is one of the best in the world , with a long tradition , but some voices are just unfitting or some voice actors are assigned to too many real actors , making you hear their voice quite often . 
  sometimes the german voice actor can contribute to the success of a movie though , like with pirates of the carribean , jack sparrows voice was even gayer than the original , when they changed voice actor in the 4th movie , many negative german reviews were about missing the old voice . 
  maybe some parts were produced somewhere else and then assembled in your home country ? 
  not sure , but that would mean a huge share of german products, 
  is maitre gims well liked in france ? 
  every french person i met seemed to listen to him which i ca n't really understand , but maybe it 's just not my genre, 
  pls no . 
  most popular would probably be till lindemann though not a ( s ) solo act . 
  gentleman is also quite popular, 
  saunas are gender segregated in greece ? 
  erasmus is responsible for a lot of births, 
  while i was studying we worked on a text about ikea , turns out their highest market share ( like 2011 ) in any country was 11 % . 
  it may have gotten up since then but they do n't dominate any single market , its just that most furniture houses do n't operate on a global scale and many are just a single store or a smaller chain, 
  [ kinda agree ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x9lvc9wkkq&amp;ab_channel=facundojg ), 
  wait i thought portugal was pretty accepting of gays ? 
  clearly * we * were the first victims !, 
  some germans secretly wish our country would be more like switzerland : more conservative , stay out of international politics , more orderly . 
  personally , i 've never * really * been to switzerland , just crossed the gotthard . 
  seems like a turbo capitalist country in comparison to its neighbours . 
  people from there were mostly weird , met a guy who rented a house in dortmund so he could attend every home game and actually flew there every 2nd weekend or so . 
  met people from the french part who have absolutely no right to say germans have no sense of humour , oh my . 
  and sorry but when a drunk swiss guy from the german part starts talking it 's impossible to take them seriously :d, 
  our wages have barely kept up with inflation the last 20-30 years , relatively speaking they are quite low . 
  plus we have like 2nd or 3rd highest disparity between worker and management wages in the world, 
  refugees ca n't be given a job in the first 15months after arrival if an eu national applies for the same , regardless of skill , so yes , there is positive bias . 
  fun guy, 
  like a bridge between east and west, 
  many , i mean my parents have taken a family into their house and they get visits from their friends from the time they were still in a refugee camp . 
  also , there 's like a distribution camp between my parents village and the nearest bigger city where i change trains so many refugees were also on the same train route . 
  most were friendly and had some naive enthusiasm about them . 
  they always asked which station they had to leave and i could save them 2 stops because the camp was in a town with 3 stops and the first of those was closest to the camp but the name of the station would not indicate that it 's the same town ( it 's weird ) . 
  we had fascist governments in europe even long after wwii, 
  i hope you 're rich because oktoberfest in munich is gon na cost you a lot , can easily go in the thousands when you include accomodation, 
  depends , in descending order : rewe , edeka , netto ( without dog ) , aldi, 
  [ a frisian making fun of bavarian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hjmk28kwdg&amp;ab_channel=eisern1966 ) . 
  but honestly , [ that shit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eappibmtjf4&amp;ab_channel=vollgeraet ) is near incomprehensible,
