  when i notice them struggling i switch to english / french , if that does n't help hands and shouting, 
  there was a survey a few years back which said that ~ 40 % of `` men '' aged 14-50 shave their armpits ( or trim at least ) . 
  i can only comment on the rest anecdotally , but chest hair seems to be shaved less than that and arms/legs only when you 're a bodybuilder . 
  i have a friend who even gets his ass shaved by his trainer for competitions . 
  well i thought he was just inquiring about the reichsb\u00fcrger specifically, 
  [ sources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsb%c3%bcrgerbewegung ) in english are harder to come by , german [ article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsb%c3%bcrgerbewegung ) for comparison, 
  closing shops on sundays ( yeah i know other countries like austria and greece do it too ), 
  * schlappen * would be more fitting , we have several names for it though , * pantoffeln , puschen , latschen * but the best translation for slipper is schlappen, 
  yeah but it 's ( a variant of ) what we wear inside , well literal translation would be `` house shoe '', 
  barbarians wear shoes inside the house , civilized people do n't !, 
  [ comfy as fuck though ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tiv1lcv7j6wto3nmtzmq_t14vdpiyo9idwyxofs86o2c=w744-h558-no ), 
  also , do n't use bavarian and german and nazi interchangeably d :, 
  we get offended if you use * nazi * and * german * interchangeably as if there were no difference, 
  i do n't want to give this channel views , but someone reuploaded it with [ subtitles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vzpfdutyty&amp;ab_channel=philosophyworkout ) . 
  ( reading description should be enough to know why i do n't want to give this channel views ) . 
  the subtitles are decent , not perfect, 
  wait did they dub it into portuguese * and * european portuguese ? 
  oh in the same vein , the german version of [ be prepared ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmt45bf5som&amp;ab_channel=lionkingsongs ) is better [ imo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncpjg8xea3y&amp;ab_channel=mario1425 ) but can mostly be accredited to the voice actor , i simply think his voice is cooler, 
  the thing is , they simply put the prices 1:1, 
  lead, 
  hm though i do like the french original , i think l'international / the international / die internationale sounds better in german, 
  when you wait for the traffic light to turn green at night and someone else waits for it , too, 
  [ very german surname does n't always prevent questions being asked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonio_r%c3%bcdiger ), 
  our beach was flat for kilometres . 
  we did make a few inland trips but it was just soo hot . 
  i 'm kinda redheaded so even with sunblock 50 i ca n't stay out for too long . 
  just was n't my location, 
  the decline of the soviet union had started way before he was president and can mostly be attributed to its own leadership . 
  whether or not he authorised it , iran-contra affair still happened under his rule and he bombed lybia . 
  he also further pushed the war on drugs started by nixon ( another president i ca n't stand , at least he was stupid enough to bug himself ), 
  it 's a [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6liqnjc1rku&amp;ab_channel=pitchfork ) reference . 
  to me he is a war criminal . 
  what he was good at was where nixon was scrutinised for his actions , anyone who criticised reagan got called a traitor , makes it rather easy . 
  i 'm glad reagan dead, 
  why would you ever visit eastern germany, 
  or it could be the sun ? 
  either france ( brittany ) or spain ( mallorca ) i guess . 
  i 've been to brittany like 8x but that one time was just awful , 13 year old me with my parents and my 2year old niece on a camping site in a rented caravan . 
  it was the only time we were at that camping site , the beach was kinda ugly , the toilets were extraordinarily clogged even for camping site standards ( it were those squatting toilets ) but the real thing was it was raining for 10 days straight . 
  when we arrived the weather changed from sunshine to rain and when we left 10days later it changed from rain to sunshine . 
  you 're a 13 year old boy confined into 4m \u00b2 with a 2 year old and your parents . 
  in a similar vein was the mallorca one . 
  holiday with parents and one sister , i think she 12 me 10 . 
  in brittany you could at least go cliff climbing or on the occasional castle visit , mallorca , even though it was the northern coast , had very little to offer and the meditteranean is kinda boring imo , waves are knee level max ( yes i know it can get wild , but just no comparison to the atlantic ) . 
  i did n't want to return there but we went anyway the next year , but that was it . 
  it was so boring we actually played bingo one evening with all those retired people . 
  sorry spain i know you 're great but mallorca is just not for young children . 
  prices doubled which gave it the nickname `` t $ uro '' ( teuer = expensive ), 
  sometimes i think the only reason you stayed in the hre is because everyone was illiterate, 
  more like a federal state , sorry, 
  actually southern italy is one of the poorest regions in all of europe, 
  holy shit philippines and ceylon , i knew about pretty much the rest but damn, 
  is n't australia very xenophobic as well ? 
  depending on country , drinkable tap water . 
  mediterranean is awful , i even buy bottled water to brush teeth there, 
  both, 
  just claim you 're still the knights and have claims on the holy lands and rhodos, 
  become a dane ? 
  maybe he meant bolognese ? 
  well it sounds like that in german as well , but we do n't have such bread . 
  you guys just posted a wwi propaganda poster insulting our bread and in return we took over your front page !, 
  [ same ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder276/50458276.jpg ), 
  did n't we have a meme war over this a few months ago ? 
  must i remind you of the result ? 
  almost none , there are like 5000 bavarians who would like to maybe secede . 
  franconians would prefer to have their own state and not be part of bavaria . 
  i heard about some frisians maybe wanting more autonomy and some people form schleswig holstein wanting something similar . 
  same for sorbians in the east , but they all have very little support from what i 've heard , maybe someone from those areas can give a better overview . 
  nah its the highest form of secondary education in germany and some other countries, 
  there are still greeks who claim at least the western coast of anatolia so do n't expect this to go down in a few generations, 
  some people in prague would probably prefer if there were more distance to germany :d, 
  well most modern european conflicts can still be traced back to the extraordinarily bad peace treaties of wwi . 
  wwii resolved some of them by ethnic cleansing, 
  wait i thought you call it gymnasium as well, 
  i doubt anything could seriously harm the relationship between france , benelux and us , as for the rest not so sure, 
  try learning german beforehand , even if the university offers courses in english ( which is quite rare ) it will improve your life quality immensely, 
  oh i had misinterpreted it , thought you meant people from saxony :d, 
  most liked probably italians , though they are as badly integrated as turks, 
  only saxons ? 
  ruhr area is also very poor nowadays but far from undeveloped, 
  you 'll find shit roads anywhere in ireland , though , kind of like a trademark, 
  no neither , she mostly spent her last years on my aunt 's farm . 
  for events like marriages she was driven by my aunts family . 
  in matches with austria involved i tend to root for you guys as well . 
  no , i moved from rural area to big city and barely felt any change . 
  only thing weird was that they 'd never seen a cow but oh well . 
  there are massive differences from big city to big city , even within the same country, 
  no , it 's regarded as cancer here, 
  around 80 % of them would like to stay , at least this time we are putting more thought into it than with the turks , still overwhelmed and underfunded though, 
  3 if i find someone stupid enough to raise them with me, 
  depends on the fitness i guess , my grandma could n't do shit in her last years , she died with 88, 
  if they make it to the world cup :d, 
  nah it 's too much fun to let it die :d, 
  tbh you and the belgians are currently better than the dutch, 
  damn and i thought the swiss hate us, 
  berlin, 
  * settlers of catan * monopoly * scotland yard * ticket to ride : europe used to be popular but got out of fashion * trivial pursuit * carcassone * risk * kingdom builder * nobody is perfect card games are also very popular , like doppelkopf , skat ( no , pronounced like skaht ) , mau mau , romm\u00e9e and maaaaaaany more, 
  excluding the parties right of cdu/csu ( so npd , republikaner , afd etc ) i disagree the most with csu then cdu, 
  [ you see this shit ? 
  ] ( https://www.sodastreamusa.com/assets/productimages/swm_source_starterkit_white_novpp.jpg ) we put tap water in the bottle , then gas it,
