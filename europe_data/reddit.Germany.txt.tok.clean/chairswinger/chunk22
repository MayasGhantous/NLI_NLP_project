  do you often watch germany games when you 're not even rooting for them ? 
  i mean we do n't often play vs austria and in friendlies , our game tends to be terrible, 
  it 's very common but the infrastructure is still lacking in comparison to the netherlands , but that 's an unfair comparison :d also depends on the age , of course , you wo n't see 70 year olds travel by bike everywhere . 
  cologne is basically the 2nd gayest city in germany and everyone is ok with it, 
  yes, 
  i do n't even think about it lol, 
  do n't ever speak to me or my son ever again, 
  we had the same obsession once, 
  my grandfather was born in 1909 so technically he had memories . 
  he died when i was 10 though so i did n't really talk to him about it . 
  from what i 've been told he mostly remembered the hunger . 
  my country ? 
  hm , neutral . 
  world ? 
  liability ? 
  libya and somalia are the first to come to mind , but you currently have more than 100 active missions in africa , which are more than 15 % of your current total foreign missions . 
  also , 2nd most people deployed in africa after the middle east . 
  depends on the animals and the area . 
  some areas have an annual boar or deer purge since they breed too much , cause harm to the forest and endanger the object with the biggest lobby behind it , the car and therefore the people inside it . 
  nah it 's aight , the traveling simplification is just godlike, 
  but like 20 % of their population are in the european part and it is undeniable that their history is greatly interwoven with the rest of europe, 
  oh forgot about those but in my area thats more referred to as zewa, 
  it 's the designs, 
  for history class we had to do our family tree and luckily 1 of my grandparents was still alive , could trace it back to middle 18th century . 
  my fathers family lived in northern germany the whole time and my mothers family lived in saxony until after the war , her father moved to western germany in 1950 when things started to become obvious ( his wife being pregnant with my mother being another reason ), 
  maybe as a verb , k\u00e4rchern ? 
  * tempo - paper tissues * k\u00e4rcher - high pressure cleaners * tesa - transparent adhesive tape ( or in general tesa-xxx - xxx-tape ), 
  lannisters always pay their debt ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  oh boy tell me more, 
  does n't necessarily mean anything , i mean you 're somewhat american and almost have amsterdam in your name and schwertritter could answer for poland, 
  for anyone wondering since no flair - germany, 
  or was it ? 
  i mean we * are * in a union of some sort, 
  i guess there are very few people who do n't accept the oder-nei\u00dfe border but apart from that not really, 
  so here 's a little story i used to play in a youth orchestra and someone in the music school managed to organise an exchange with an us choir , one year our orchestra goes there to practice and perform , next year they come to us for the same thing , everyone lives at a host family . 
  we germans had to sign several things like even if we have the permission or age to do stuff in germany , we will refrain from it in the usa , so no driving cars and no drinking alcohol ( even the one 21year old guy ) . 
  once we arrived in the little town and hopped out of the bus there are the host families with our names on signs , i find mine which has a girl of about 12years with them , she 's the youngest daughter . 
  we go into the car and drive home , on the way the girl says `` can we stop at xyz ? '', 
  ( some streetside shop , it was a rural area , probably also a liquor store ) . 
  i stay in the car because i was tired after the 8h flight and 5h bus ride . 
  they come back in and the girl goes `` oh mom he has to try root beer '' . 
  i think `` wtf kind of family is this where they start drinking at 12 ? '', 
  but the mom anticipated this and says `` it 's not atcual beer , it 's a soft drink '' . 
  i think `` all right , sure '' and take a sip . 
  this is beyond sweet . 
  * disgustingly * sweet . 
  after 1 sip i felt the need to brush my teeth . 
  how the fuck can you drink that ? 
  well , for starters , switzerland has 4 official languages and is highly federalized with the cantons wielding a lot of power, 
  we do n't share that !, 
  we want it to stay that way :d it 's even worse for the locals . 
  my friends and i once discovered a hidden beach where apparently all the locals go , some asked us to not share the location with others,

  was like a symbol for independence but now gradually shifts to the guy who let the peasants die and was an anti-semite, 
  well depends whether you like beaches or not . 
  france , croatia , italy , greece are all extremely popular and offer both beaches and mountains ( same for spain ) . 
  but landlocked countries also offer a lot . 
  then there 's also the decision whether you want countryside or city , personally , i do n't like hotel holidays so i either go camping which probably is not an option for a canadian family or rent a country house which is rather cheap tbh, 
  tbf ukraine was sabotaging the existing pipelines and we shall freeze because of that ? 
  huh i have n't even heard of those terminals until a week ago and most articles i read concerning it were supportive , could have been some populist paper like bild or express though that called it us trojan horse , they like to conflict themselves within the same day . 
  oh google just yielded a result , apparently it 's a title of a study , but it 's more about the `` new '' eu memberstates and their relationship with the usa in general , but i 'm not gon na read 30 pages now ugh, 
  oh most of those mods are only playable without barbarians . 
  russia starts off so far away from everyone they get invaded by barbarians from all sides , indonesia usually starts on a 3 tile island it ca n't leave until it can sail the oceans etc. 
  the civ own world maps are ok balanced , just not accurate with the civ placements and closer theatre maps like east asia or europe tend to be somewhat ok, 
  well i usually go for wc :d but i really like playing underdogs ( this , of course , is not possible in civ or aoe as everyone starts on equal footing ), 
  not necessarily , in grand strategy games i really like playing in italy and germany because i think their history and situation is just so goddamn interesting but other than that there are no limits , everyone gets tested ( obviously not in paradox as there are way too many different ) and most of the times i set my enemies as the plausible rivals or completely random , depending on mood or playstyle , no eternal enemy carried over from game to game, 
  idk only heard it from brits so far but i barely ever met irish so i did n't want to exclude you, 
  u/suchakant almost simultanously :d you 're closer to the latin origin then , its paene insula and paene means almost, 
  i had the chance to go to israel but i declined for various reasons , safety being one of them, 
  france has lots of black people , maybe its just your beauty ? 
  in some other countries you 'd get the `` exotenbonus '' ( exotic bonus , applies to almost every foreigner ), 
  or through russia though i get that for some time that was not really an option, 
  probably in all languages :d same in german , `` halbinsel '', 
  not really because 90 % of the cases all they want to know is about nazis , so 3/10 ?

  what about saying cz is not central european ? 
  quebecois is weird though, 
  police would not get off without charges if they kill someone over this . 
  i also put the chances for asylum over this to 0 % , that 's something we ca n't fix for you , try the regular emigration route, 
  got ta concede though that it 's not berlin specific , more like a large city thing , though still not as common as in berlin, 
  haha , reminds me of all the exchange students we had who wore sweaters and scarves in summer while we wore shorts and t-shirts, 
  excuse me ? 
  [ our eagle is like no other ] ( http://imgur.com/71mcidz ), 
  do n't equate berlin with germany , we do n't talk about berlin, 
  unless you are a tourist and prefer camping , all the camping sites i 've been to still have them and they were * always * clogged wtf other tourists, 
  already got figured out where you want to go ? 
  poland or somewhere else ? 
   cosmopolitan cities  munich we call it the biggest village in the world, 
  well neither are the usa :d, 
  but you need to fill it with a certain amount so you can actually wash your hands , i can just soap my hands and then turn the faucet on for a few seconds, 
  [ what about hungary ?

  eeh, 
  i was told you mix it in the sink but that 's just wasteful imo, 
  anglophone expats on the whole integrate worse than other immigrants and americans are no exception . 
  often they live in an expat bubble , especially former soldiers who came to like it here , and do n't learn the language, 
  what 's with the \u00dc , but looks better than the average american hot dog but cost like 10x more :d also wtf sauerkraut on hot dog ? 
  idk , many of my friends `` forgot '' english after leaving school since they do n't need it or use it,
