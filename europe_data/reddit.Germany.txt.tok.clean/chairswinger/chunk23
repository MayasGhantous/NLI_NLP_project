  i suppose you 're right, 
  kinda like germany just one more layer basically . 
  capital idk , brussels or stra\u00dfburg maybe, 
  til, 
  except in germany maybe , where we have expat bubbles , but then i do n't really approve of that, 
  i only know of 1 person , not even the jew and the muslims i know are circumsized , talk about cherrypicking your faith, 
  when in the usa they attempted to do bratwurst in br\u00f6tchen , but it basically were hotdogs, 
  what the fuck, 
  so the people working there usually do n't have high education, 
  do n't even have to leave germany for that tbh, 
   de - m\u00fcnchen ( bayern embodies many foreigners perception of the country ) over my dead body, 
  wanted to say brittany but then  not much fans of beaches . 
    prefer places with good transport and good infrastructure   other places than uk/france/germany \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af netherlands i guess , maybe some rural parts of austria, 
  pretty sure the majority is . 
  i 've seen extremely few going further than the regular government bashing which we all do, 
  a beer or a few glasses of wine after work , more on the weekends or football matches, 
  benelux , too, 
  exactly, 
  it 's kind of a big scamming industry over there , that 's how you get all those americans saying * i 'm 38 % irish , 15 % french , 12 % german * etc, 
  maybe miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well , born in poland but made it to the german national team, 
  i really like the german one , i think it 's one of the most refined, 
  do n't give more building space to hotels, 
  i think we try to be more grounded , ambition is nice and all but come back when you 've actually done it, 
  surrender of maine !, 
  ... oh different maine , lobsters , i guess , not much else, 
  well someones hateful, 
  damn no wonder our local refugee centre got a heads up for new years eve , if you do n't know it and come from a warzone this might be triggering, 
  probably jart or reel , though i do not look for specific brands when shopping , i just buy what i like and happen to own a few reel pants and jart hoodies/t-shirts . 
  jart is also a german brand which at least used to produce in portugal , not sure if they still do , and it 's kinda hard getting clothes in my pricerange produced in europe and not east asia, 
  netherlands probably, 
  not sure about this one ... 
  i have more of a problem with the actual name of my country in different languages, 
  it 's the ipa symbol , not the letter, 
  i do n't think frisians are comparable to the others mentioned :d, 
  oh did n't know them , you might know or like [ herr von grau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjxbqmqaipu&amp;ab_channel=mccookie ) or [ dendemann ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayt7gba38og&amp;ab_channel=fourmusic ), 
  anti-rap is really popular here , making fun of the genre and being self aware , like * [ k.i.z. 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vebab_jebra&amp;ab_channel=k.i.z.official ) * [ fettes brot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbchsusqio4&amp;ab_channel=fettesbrot ) ( ok this one is serious but generally they are lighthearted ) * [ aggro berlin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxsvpxw7jds&amp;ab_channel=aggro.tv ) * [ alligatoah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahwc-oufetq&amp;ab_channel=hitbox ) * [ 257ers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drfsxlchrwc&amp;ab_channel=selfmaderecords ) * one could also argue [ kollegah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbtgdzf9ts8&amp;ab_channel=selfmaderecords ) fits in here but i think he takes himself to serious , but from a skilllevel point of view he 's definitely good . 
  * bonus : [ jan b\u00f6hmermann aka pol1z1stens0hn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnjg22gbo6u&amp;ab_channel=neomagazinroyale ) * bonus 2 : [ kool savas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flll2ld4ie4&amp;ab_channel=optikrecordstv ) king of german hip hop, 
  you could say the movie was ... for the greater good !, 
  we became united and there 's people who actually like fc bayern now, 
  stuff by loriot , lammbock , stromberg , stuff by bully . 
  do n't have to pay taxes , in fact , they have their own tax . 
  time to burn some monasteries again, 
  we do n't really claim michael fassbender, 
  not necessarily the same , but a lot of kids in rural towns go to `` kjg lager '' ( katholische junge gemeinde - catholic youth community ) or people who play instruments go to `` musikfreizeit '' ( music camp ( ? ) ), 
  for a week -10 days each . 
  i guess the biggest uncertainties in my country are central/eastern europe and balkans . 
  for some , poland and czechia are eastern europe , for some they are central , for some slovenia and austria are balkans , for some they are central . 
  for some greece does n't get grouped in with the balkans but rather with italy/spain/portugal, 
  also known as the wei\u00dfwurst\u00e4quator, 
  basically non-existent . 
  i think the biggest resemblance of a relationship can be said about namibia , germany pumps the most development aid into it . 
  i heard the majority of namibians are indifferent or favourable towards germans , except the herero , of course . 
  it 's also a well-liked tourist destination for germans . 
  excluding metal and punk ? 
  uuuh damn i do n't really listen to rock i guess . 
  arctic monkeys , hives , oh [ blues pills !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmydyyqmqga&amp;ab_channel=bluespills ) ( shut up , blues rock counts ) , [ slash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g49s6t6bj5e&amp;ab_channel=jafethalexander ) , nirvana , rhcp , [ alter bridge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obcgu-oljna&amp;ab_channel=mimmop.pisconti ) should all count as rock . 
  guess that 's it for me . 
  no accent please , thank you . 
  well , if you have to , either ruhrpott or northern german, 
  i do n't think we ever had something like that , songs like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf2kl7k-sp0&amp;ab_channel=dieprinzenvevo ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u-n-hblzvq&amp;ab_channel=thamixtape ) were so overtly ironical or by artists where there was no room for speculation , but any german can feel free to correct me, 
  in paris on one of the islands was this glacerie but it was super expensive and had a long queue , tasted good though . 
  one of our humble contributions to the world of ice is the [ spaghetti eis ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=spaghetti+eis&amp;rlz=1c1teua_ende453de453&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjildl099xuahxiohqkhekua4kq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662 ) , super tasty , especially with the frozen cream buried below it, 
  brought to us by italians sooo, 
  in black & yellow i believe, 
  or hannover , leipzig , hamburg, 
  better late than never :p, 
  why would bad beer be a good thing ? 
  personally , yes . 
  i 'm quite ashamed germany still has done basically nothing to apologise for the herero genocide . 
  i learned it in elementary school , not sure which age . 
  did it again in gymnasium in music lessons while 12 or 13 and then later in history class to clear up any confusion about the meaning of the lyrics ( which 90 % of reddit still seem to have ) . 
  personally , i 'd like the first stanza back , maybe updated to not make the dutch or polish nervous , keep the 2nd stanza out of it , though . 
  alternatively , ode to joy would also be cool to have as a hymn , but i guess we kinda have that already . 
  some people prefer the gdr one but i ca n't even remember the lyrics ( they also got removed from the official hymn later on iirc ) but the melody is very nice . 
  i just do n't have any connection to it . 
  maybe depends on where you are in rennes ? 
  to me , it was very clean , but i only was in more touristy areas . 
  brest , for example , felt way more dirty , but i also went to more every day stuff and the harbour, 
  do you also get lots of got fans as tourists then ? 
  although i doubt dubrovnik really needed that to be touristy , got a lot of charm on it 's own, 
  ye we were also on a camping ground near/in pula , we heard german out of at least half the bungalows/tents/campers :d, 
  in cologne , it 's somewhat hard to tell who 's a tourist , who 's an international student or who 's an immigrant . 
  we have quite a large portuguese , polish , turkish and japanese population . 
  on top of that , i barely ever go to the tourist spots , but chinese and japanese are seen quite a lot . 
  i heard americans prefer taking rhine cruises and are afraid of stepping foot on the land . 
  what i found striking in croatia was that people understood and even spoke german better than english ( sorry for not being able to speak croatian : c ) . 
  also , many signs in croatian and italian , though i 've been told it 's only near the coast like that, 
  go to brittany , very clean, 
  pozsgay was a reformer and played a key role in the transition to the democracy , and no , being born in 1991 and in the west spared me of everything, 
  we have something similar, 
  if you include poland and hungary into eastern europe i could say jaruzelski , quite impressive to turn weapons on your own population , in a negative sense , of course . 
  lech walesa and imre pozsgay are pretty dope figures , though . 
  from current times , however , kaczy\u0144ski and orban , while being impressive figures , strike me as very negative . 
  i thought he 's a german puppet was the general consensus ? 
  [ us , of course ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wor9qqbnfug&amp;ab_channel=tietmark ) , our lives for the dog !, 
  it 's balkans according to germans, 
  athens is n't even the most interesting city in greece imo , i 'd go with the italian one, 
  yeah i find our approach way better than russia , turkey or uk,
