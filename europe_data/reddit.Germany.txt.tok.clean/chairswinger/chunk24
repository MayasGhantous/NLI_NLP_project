  [ one can only hope ] ( https://www.blogrebellen.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gottkanzler-schulz-791x1024.jpg ), 
  which one , the first or the second ? 
  i , too , dislike bavarians , or you mean those after that ? 
  too much exposure can make my english get worse , when i was in the usa after a week i suddenly started saying `` thomesing '' instead of `` something '' and similar stuff , so i would rate my spoken english like 2points lower on a scale to 10, 
  depends on the subject , mint students tend to be more right wing , so technical universities specialised in these subjects are more conservative leaning . 
  the brexit campaign was largely going with the `` all immigrants are evil , stop immigration '' theme , i really doubt they 'd pull a 180 on that one, 
  move to the north :d, 
  recently met my first jew , he came from ukraine :d was a nice bloke , nothing much to add what others have n't told, 
  i 'm fairly certain finding a place to stay during world cup and bastille day in paris will be a major bitch , better go look * for towns like caen or bordeaux or rennes or lyon maybe, 
  come on , ours is the leader whose greatest feature was having a red beard , apart from that he was a failure on all fronts , you have pedro ^ ^ ^ ^ / s maybe you 'll get a dlc, 
  oh i do n't know , you tell me, 
  i mean , has there been any evidence ? 
  i was n't that interested in poland back then , is the case closed ? 
  donald duck , asterix & obelix , tintin are all vastly more popular , and mangas also grew to be more popular , i 've never met someone who reads dc or marvel , the justice league tv show was dope though, 
  are those the same that do the explosions or are those terrorists / independence fighters ? 
  as long as you 're not like the pinoys in dota ... :p, 
  often raid the east german border , some clubhouses and similar stuff have been looted so often , some even ripped the copper wire out of the walls . 
  bare in mind any country can veto the ascension of a new member , i 'd figure russia might meet some opposition , 1 veto is enough, 
  wait , before the fence was removed ? 
  how did you get over ? 
  did your parents tell you ? 
  so you 're probably gon na move a few more times between the two ?

  dresden at least , currently 2nd league, 
  we have at least a street called like that , so close enough :d, 
  i 'm also against malta selling eu membership soo, 
  if it went after the new york jets and chicago fire themes probably cologne rapers or something, 
  concerning education : there are also huge differences from city to city within the same state , or even school to school, 
  also , pretty sure the eu ** is ** an economic superpower, 
  probably always the same, 
  probably 10years ago or so , it was 10 in the evening and i thought some construction vehicle is driving through our street and that 's why the doors were rattling , but then it went a bit longer and no construction vehicle would drive at 10pm . 
  aftermath was something like [ this ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432284255753/626e975c-7aef-4742-9515-06739923c085-bestsizeavailable.jpeg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2cleft&amp;blend64=ahr0chm6ly91cgxvywrzlmd1aw0uy28udwsvmjaxni8wns8yns9vdmvybgf5lwxvz28tmtiwmc05mf9vchqucg5n&amp;s=d0042f3d27105918a7bd47d2c46592a9 ) . 
  in some homes the china fell out of the cupboard, 
  kinda hard to force them . 
  the whole occupation thing created some real expat bubbles . 
  bro , all brazilians i 've met here in germany were running around in jacket and scarf in summer and still shivering , you sure you wan na go somewhere where it snows in summer ? 
  i know some ex soldiers who 've been here for like 20years now and still ca n't speak german , the whole anglophone community is really lazy when it comes to learning languages, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6fnucj/would_you_support_a_boycottdivestment_campaign/dijpl51/ ), 
  oh no not this again, 
  ) city ), 
  montenegrins do n't work, 
  we have a varying amount of secondary education schools , for simplicity , i 'm gon na say 3 . 
  hauptschule and realschule only go to year 10 and people who graduate that ca n't go to university , but iirc people from realschule can at least go to a hochschule ( not to be confused with a highschool , closer to college ) . 
  gymnasium goes to year 12/13 ( depends on state ) and can go to everything once graduated , if the grades allow it . 
  we have many `` nc-refugees '' flooding netherlands/austria because it 's easier to apply to their universities with their grades for the desired subject, 
  why not ? 
  i 'm basically consuming no us goods anyway, 
  new york , which is amazing considering for like 90 % of the answers the whole us map was covered in dark blue and i only picked other 2x . 
  guess i 'm closer to her royal english ? 
  kamp stoja in pula , croatia was really cool , either with tents or small bungalows , the city is nearby if you prefer going into clubs, 
  there was not little support for fascists in the 20 's -30 's , but they stopped even before sudetenland got annexed, 
  i found the older version better than the 2008 one , had pretty weak points like where everyone wears white shirts and then punks call them fascists for that like that would happen irl, 
  germany best neighbour confirmed, 
  the sun did n't openly support hitler iirc, 
  glasgow is super hard for me , i lived together with one from there and had to ask him to repeat every sentence basically, 
  not sure what you mean ? 
  it 's not like we are collectively going after every person with darker skin than ours and reject them from getting jobs , as said before , it all depends on several factors and can result in varying degrees , like total cooperation and marriage , ignoring someone or changing seats on a bus when someone sits next to them or threatening them and demanding that they `` go back where they came from or else '' . 
  racists gon na be racists , and sadly we still have some but not that many , but also still too many, 
  depends on a lot of factors , people can go from not sitting next to them to assault . 
  or people in power may not hire someone even though he/she is qualified and speaks the language . 
  i would like to think this does n't happen often in germany but the reality is , there 's basically at least 2 assaults on a refugee centre per day on average , most with right-wing background , some even being arson ( 66 arson cases for 2016 ) . 
  and everyday racism exists , too , but not specifically aimed at persians , just at basically everyone `` arab-looking '' , though in my area not very much . 
  not many sources on that , we generally just do the civilised empires like persians or carthaginians and then romans , and then throw in the various encounters between german tribes and romans and then the whole fall of the ( western ) roman empire thing with the great migration and go from there . 
  though i guess 5th century-8th century is n't discussed in detail either , been a while though . 
  we do n't just talk about germany/germans though , is what you have to understand , we spent a lot of time looking how people lived at a certain time and how society changed , so we 'll look at dominant powers or countries which left lots of sources , and sometimes look outside of europe , though not often . 
  it was basically stone age , rivervalley civilizations , egypt , greeks , persians , carthaginians , rome , great migration with power vacuum , frankish empire and age of vikings , charles martell and charlemagne and so on and so forth, 
  hm depends on the country , too , i guess . 
  france and uk both share some history with persia so maybe persians get treated there better , no expert though . 
  in post wwii germany the shah was actually one of the biggest celebrities , and you 're right the persian diaspora in europe tends to be very secular and educated , but people who do n't like muslims or brown people wo n't care for either . 
  i 'd also agree with u/syriansimba that it 's not really easy to differentiate between iranians , arabs and turks , sorry . 
  what i can assure you is that people love iranian movies here , like from jafar panahi , i heard it 's similar in france . 
  hm bavarian or saxon i presume, 
  we basically did nothing on 30 years war . 
  generally 17th century did n't get too much attention imo , rest was somewhat decent, 
  well russia did try to provide you once , just poorly and not the only ones * cough *, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn9edpdch7c&amp;ab_channel=icotext ) gets watched every year on new years eve in germany , recently many parodies have been produced and it gets harder and harder to find the right version on tv . 
  many drinking `` games '' have emerged from this , like always drinking when the butler does , or similar stuff . 
  i heard people in austria and switzerland also watch ( ed ) this , maybe anyone can confirm or deny this ? 
  also , any other nations that watch this ? 
  [ who would win ... ] ( https://pics.onsizzle.com/who-would-win-literally-going-an-impenetrable-fortification-armed-to-21469656.png ), 
  german native english from 5th grade onwards french from 8th grade latin really weak , only latinum , 7th grade-12th spanish in university a bit , i can get around for the most basic tourist stuff but definitely not hold a conversation, 
  might be easier to find cultural elements which helped get rid of the dictatorship after his death, 
  idk , our tribal history is older than the concept of germans , so no wonder we are basically called after some tribe in almost all languages , but sometimes i wish they would go with the times like tyskland and duitsland, 
  same , also because in german we refer to you as * tschechien * 99 % of the time, 
  throw in slovakia for good measure, 
  we make fun of blondes regardless where we live though :d, 
  i 've seen a few polish shelves, 
  [ reading this as a leftie ] ( http://imgur.com/0hqyd5l ), 
  damn there 's too many , would basically become a smaller eu . 
  france , netherlands , denmark , austria , czechia , italy , spain for mallorca , maybe tuck in croatia and then slovenia for better borders , speaking of , finally get the swiss integrated, 
  maybe let austria join and have the perfect north/south autobahn !, 
  i 'm totally ok with that, 
  [ both in one pic ] ( http://www.ksta.de/image/22532544/2x1/940/470/686b0f715a8af74499ee750787edfebd/ux/koeln-panorma-3-worring.jpg ) you have the old cathedral which took hundreds of years of construction ( lack of funding ) and would dominate the skyline like the tour eiffel , but then they put some skyscrapers not far from it , which do n't even look impressive but flatout ugly . 
  ( granted , no building may be as tall as the cathedral and they look smaller than pictured here ) cologne btw, 
  only requires one hand lol jk i do n't really know, 
  do you have no spring holidays then ? 
  or also only just 1 week then , but not staggered ? 
  and i presume you have holidays during christmas time but not staggered . 
  probably should have specified school holidays , as most employed people can take their holidays whenever they want ( except for teachers , for example ), 
  i can only do m\u00fcnster and d\u00fcsseldorf with some confidence , have n't been in the other 3 cities .
