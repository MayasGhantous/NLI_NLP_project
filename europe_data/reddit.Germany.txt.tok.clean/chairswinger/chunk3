  with `` court language '' i meant the modern day court , not the noble kind , basically what i wnted to say was that high-german is the * lingua franca * , though of course , we can often still understand each other when talking , but fuck bavarians , saxons and colognians though iirc french was still spoken a lot in german noble courts even after napoleon, 
  atlantic is so cold though , i guess it depends on what you want out of it , mediterranean waves are pretty pathetic, 
  you basically get a coast , not that leased land in hamburg, 
  many german dialects basically are , high-german is just the `` court language '', 
  [ c'est pourqoui ] ( http://1tvs492zptzq380hni2k8x8p.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/riberyeyegouge.jpg ) . 
  jk there are hot french men out there, 
  wow did n't know there were that many countries below germany , i always thought we were basically 2nd worst after japan, 
  more like horny french men, 
  til africans ca n't be muslims, 
  on the other hand , luxembourg seems to become portugal .2, 
  hey its me , your extra virgin, 
  yeah we took a boat tour around , hard to get in when travelling with females ;(, 
  that 's mexico you fool !, 
  i always mix this up with mount athos , or worse , i always think this is on mt. 
  i think the cretan city-states were allied with macedon , for the most part they were not involved in mainland activities but devolved into more and more conflict until the romans came, 
  did you turn captions on ? 
  pretty sure netherlands does n't have any similar dumb laws from 19th century, 
  [ $ $ $ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=texatquvqac&amp;ab_channel=flippy60 ), 
  you 're the heart of europe , of course you matter !, 
  what else do you want ? 
  you already get our cheap booze while we uh ... steal your moose signs, 
  as if french would walk through there, 
  but who has more fame ? 
  hitler always wins, 
  can you read facial expressions ? 
  no no , that 's not german , also , it 's really unfortunate that they all suffer from larynx cancer, 
  german is still an official language in namibia , and there is quite some tourism from germany to namibia , so maybe duolingo is mostly used by people who work in tourism / business in namibia, 
  liberated in the sense that germany was the first country taken by the nazis , they never got the majority of the votes . 
  and yes , there are actually a lot of russians and russian descendants here, 
  not really , we have a lot of local/regional festivals and many christian holidays , i think the only thing that could come close to an old school rally would be carnival and the `` gro\u00dfe zapfenstreich '' but that 's more of a government thing and only happens every now and then , not a fixed date, 
  til uk is a country from the east, 
  it took a little longer until germany was liberated  we do n't really have anything of that sort , on 8 may there is some kind of remembrance , but no national holiday . 
  labour day ( 1 may ) is huge here , though, 
  oh yeah that , too , i 'm not all that familiar with italian holidays , i meant the republic day ( 2 june 1946 ), 
  well we celebrate the 1990 one , similar to how italy celebrates the 1946 one, 
  germany 's unification of 1871 is n't celebrated either, 
  we do n't have tacos, 
  our pension system relies on population growth though, 
   but 80 % still believe germany should cooperate closely . 
  actually , the independent messed up the translation , in the german source it says 80 % are in favour of working more closely with the rest of europe ** against ** trump , so 180 \u00b0 change, 
  have you ever lived near barracks ? 
  they have nothing to do besides getting shitfaced and harassing people, 
  probably mountain ranges , southern france is [ pretty mountainous ] ( http://www.europakarte.org/reliefkarte-europa/ ) , and some other areas could be more agricultural , but i guess a french could answer this better, 
  trump is n't a new phenomenon either , we see around 50 % of the country as lunatics , the trust towards the usa under obama was only around 55 % , it was lower before obama , because , well , bush, 
  * die linke * is the actual successor : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_left_ ( germany ) #foundation edit : ca n't format with parentheses :(, 
  forests and dead zones from wwi , called [ zone rouge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zone_rouge ), 
  in germany people want green or left voters to vote for spd so cdu loses , but i 'll vote whatever i want, 
  i do n't think this can be blamed on cdu , it mostly affects nazi-symbols and extreme violence . 
  with the former it 's a thing with the law , you can only show nazi symbols in germany in artform , so movies are ok , videogames do not count as art . 
  another stopper was the whole `` shooters cause amok runners '' debate in the early 2000 's . 
  [ left 4 dead comparison ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh7qctuaxgi&amp;ab_channel=necridpopsicle ) ( violence , same as in australia , though in recent games if they 're rated for 18 it does n't seem to get censore anymore ) [ southpark ] ( http://i.imgur.com/obc69hw.jpg ) this is pretty cheap censoring . 
  ca n't find something on call of duty right now , but most swastika-flags were either removed or reworked into an iron cross . 
  for most of these censorships there 's a german-made mod though , even with german and english language support, 
  is that her * actual * name though ? 
  that , for me , is the funniest part, 
  you take that back !, 
  i mean , in videogames we probably censor the most out of any western country , besides australia , but that 's about it, 
  fuck , forgot to get a gf again, 
  but everyone knows post karma    comment karma, 
  enthusiasm to join the bundeswehr is pretty low , and support for military missions abroad is even lower . 
  ( mainly because every mission we 've been a part of since our first post-wwii military action in the yugoslav wars have a tainted feeling ), 
  exactly, 
  [ there 's a connection ] ( https://satwcomic.com/germany-on-vacation ), 
  it 's a gift that keeps on giving, 
  sanctions and boycotts almost always affect the little people and not those in power . 
  ye but in german the word `` gesellig '' also exists , just means something slightly different, 
  ye written dutch is almost completely understandable , though there are probably some wrong interpretations of the tense and some words like gezellig , but when you speak it 's definitely not understandable, 
  almost , `` reparierte dies f\u00fcr dich '' , it 's a bad literal translation, 
  worse than austria ? 
  they ca n't even speak german !, 
  we still only have 1 vote like everyone else, 
  i ca n't think of europe without turkey ( or russia ) edit : ayyy first message received  because you 're a shithead turk diaspora flying german tag on your username . 
  get the fuck out of europe , you will never be european . 
  am bratwurst though : /, 
  while venice certainly is most well known for this , poland also had its history with the [ title ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/most_serene_republic ), 
  shamefur dispray, 
  and what a lovely first contact that was , right ? 
  would n't make sense , as germans were n't celts , though there is a theory that it was a tribe settling in modern day netherlands, 
  your comment has been copyright-claimed by system of a down, 
  nazi slogans are popular among hooligans , especially `` eastern '' european ones, 
  reparierte das f\u00fcr dich , bad-literal translation of ftfy, 
  uhm afraid 90 % of the german you pick up in r/de is absolutely not applicable in real life , we 're shitposting masters there, 
  we need more time !, 
  what are we supposed to achieve in 5 years ? 
  i mean , except the wildfires , all things are applicable, 
  so not all crimes but almost all , i think otherwise 100 % of asylum seekers would be criminals for illegally crossing borders , a crime a german can not commit what 's also to note , only 6,5 % of all crimes were commited by asylum seekers while the total crimes reported even sank by 0,6 % that year . 
  most common crime by these groups was theft with 40,5 % ( or 83.496 cases ) , least common were ( 2 bad translations by me ahead ) * crimes against life * ( straftaten gegen das leben ) with 0,1 % or 233 cases and * offences against sexual self-determination * ( straftaten gegen die sexuelle selbstbestimmung ) with 0,8 % or 1683 cases . 
  67,7 % ( 76.775 ) of these committed only 1 crime , the people who committed crimes against life , of course , having a much bigger disparity with 97,9 %, 
  sadly , not really , though during schr\u00f6der 's time there was some ironical saying `` schr\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6der ! '', 
  and fist shaking ( previous chancellor ), 
  it 's ok we all do mistakes , but still , never heard of restaurants being referred to as yugos like italian or turkish , maybe it 's a ruhrpott thing, 
  their roads are shitty and they drive like crazy , constant wildfires , also they speak a weird language , but yeah , it 's one dope island i wish to return to again, 
  [ i love scotch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovukatl4l_g&amp;ab_channel=peterghosh ), 
  sadly , no :(, 
  grey knights op plz nerf, 
  i 'm assuming the first one means everyone is a german puppet of some sort ? 
  dow 2 is completely different , more multiplayer focused . 
  in dow you had base building , and after all the expansions it really was ( and still is ) a good game , i still play it with friends from time to time . 
  dow 2 has very little resource management and is more about getting your units through the mission with better use of cover , but no base building , though the hero customization was pretty good, 
  it was mostly meant as a joke ( admittedly , bad , but i do n't think mr golyadkin was all that serious either ) .
