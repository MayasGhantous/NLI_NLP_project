  but if i had to bet money i guess based on statistics and anecdotes . 
  croatians usually tend to like germany . 
  though now looking back at the statistics bosnian-herzegovinians are n't a safer bet than macedonians as their population share is lower official police-statistics : * serbians : 1,9 % of asylum seekers ; 7,6 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * bosnia-herzegovina : 0,6 % of asylum seekers ; 2,0 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * macedonia : 1,3 % of asylum seekers ; 2,5 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers guess i 'll post some more interesting ones while i 'm at it * georgia : 0,5 % asylum seekers ; 4,0 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * kosovo : 3 % asylum seekers ; 6,0 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * albania : 6,4 % of asylum seekers ; 8,5 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * algeria : 1,3 % of asylum seekers ; 7,4 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * tunisia : 0,2 % of asylum seekers ; 2,2 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * syria : 39,2 % of asylum seekers ; 9,1 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * iraq : 11,1 % of asylum seekers ; 3,2 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers * afghanistan : 14,1 % of asylum seekers ; 5,2 % of crimes committed by asylum seekers going by this , i would go with serbia , as kosovo is not a part of the 6 mentioned options ( and not recognized by many ) , and has a larger population share than the others ( [ source ] ( https://www.bka.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/publikationen/jahresberichteundlagebilder/kriminalitaetimkontextvonzuwanderung/kriminalitaetimkontextvonzuwanderung_2015.html?nn=62336 ) from 2015 so take with a grain of salt ) edit : a few errors and added source, 
  ay that works in german , too !, 
  oh and i always forget about kosovo , but that 's pretty easy to place fi you know where montenegro , macedonia and albania are, 
   fairly small countries that i think a lot of non-european people ca n't place on a map . 
  i 'm also guilty of this : x mostly with bosnia-herzegovina and serbia , and latvia and lithuania, 
  oh shit , that must be it , does it happen often ? 
  damn women always running amok !, 
  i think we can exclude croatia and macedonia , so i 'd go with bosnia-herzegovina or serbia, 
  baltic restaurants yugos ??? 
  that does n't make sense and i 've never heard that, 
  well i 've only ever lived in nrw , i may have to ask my friends who stayed in the village i grew up in what they 're paying , could be around the average , right now i 'm in cologne and paying 400 $ for 13m \u00b2 ( granted , it 's * warm * costs excluding internet/telephone , but i do n't get any returns at the end of the year if i used less energy ), 
  unrelated , but anyone got cossacks 3 ? 
  how does it hold up compared to back to war and napoleonic wars ? 
  where do you get 6,90 $ / m \u00b2 ? 
  :o everywhere i lived was 10 $ or higher, 
  do n't forget that uk 's nukes are stationed in scotland  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i could even see some english move to scotland before they leave the eu in hopes of voting secession and reentering eu, 
  it is albania, 
  like the flag of albania , black eagle on red background , could be possible that you got it because it 's the first in the list due to starting with a, 
  germany 0 points here we come, 
  oh so like `` thanks , obama ! '', 
  like british officials accusing germany for their bad air ? 
  no one is feeling guilty , but there is a sense of responsibility, 
  ( eastern europe ) oh no more brown people, 
  ca n't compete with the spanish gifts though, 
  [ for the uninitiated ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gz1diixmee&amp;ab_channel=krubs ), 
  there was an article a few years ago on 11freunde how the gdr ( ddr ) team would look like now , was pretty strong , included players like schmelzer and kroos, 
  i only mentioned these four as they were the ones mentioned in the article, 
  they were already successful before though, 
  so you want france , germany , italy and spain to leave the eu ? 
  same thing happened to germany when we united and look at us now !, 
  ( ok many other factors played in ), 
  if you want a third world war, 
  i think you overestimate the german 's knowledge of it 's laws . 
  i think the reaction was more towards shooting at kids and mothers if they should try crossing the german border instead of general use of weapons for borderguards, 
  member greece-germany ? 
  we still go there, 
  hello frau kepetry, 
  in maaskantje this is definitely true, 
  as you 've noticed , the map is quite bad , and having no clear date makes it all the harder . 
  i was gon na write some shit here but thought i 'd better link to the wiki page ( do n't know how to format with parentheses so here goes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93polish_war_ ( 1002 % e2 % 80 % 9318 ) ) . 
  basically , the orange line indicates a conflict , as to why names are written german , maybe the american authors had problems with writing polish names ( also , there are cities depicted that were n't cities at the time , so again , bad map ), 
  you got my hopes up high there, 
  wait maybe i 'm searching wrong but i ca n't find anything on it , is it a state owned park operated in germany ? 
  how does that work , do you just directly sell the power to us ? 
  somehow every girl on festivals seems to own one , not that i 'm complaining, 
  i guess both are vast exaggerations , while it is true that most of the turks that came with the deal in the 50s ( or 60s , ca n't remember ) were * used * for manual labour , since then ~ 2 generations happened with children attending the schools and more people migrated to germany . 
  we do absolutely have turkish ( based ) intellectuals here , but most of them have accepted german citizenship and therefore do n't count into some statistics anymore . 
  its a subsidiary of glass - be careful sport, 
  and adidas ( or abidas ) would n't be ? 
  i think there are 3 with no name , i would guess one of them is poland but who knows , it is n't even restricted to europe , could be almost anything, 
  while we 're on topic , pineapple in a frying pan is also very delicious , works good with chicken, 
  people you need not care about, 
  i do n't think its trump as much as israel 's government itself . 
  trump is a different topic . 
  they are, 
  cdu/csu , the civil union is almost equal to marriage though and public support for equal rights is very high , but it seems to almost-equal-state has made people content so there is n't much agitation towards it . 
  should we ever get another leading party same-sex-marriage will 99 % sure get instated, 
  cars on cobbled road ? 
  so loud, 
  guess there is no point arguing with you then, 
  daily reminder to not read comments, 
  eu approval is around 70 % in germany according to surveys, 
  by the syrians we took in , i meant the actual syrian family now living under our roof, 
  netherlands , get on with doggerland already, 
  well guess germany was n't responsible for wwii because the nsdap never gained majority, 
  the syrians we took in are almost as white as we are , on a picture with this distance in full clothing i 'd wager it 's hard to make out whether they are * brown * or * white * and would it matter anyway ? 
  first thing that comes to my mind is basketball players having had 1,8 m beds, 
  [ here with timestamp ] ( https://youtu.be/r2e2yhjc_mc?t=56 ) , also for any non-germans , enable subtitles, 
  turkey was once germanys prime destination for holidays , also , germany has no warm water coast , and north sea is kinda bad for bathing as you have to walk kilometers in knee-deep water before you can swim , water is cold , and the tides can be treacherous, 
  can confirm , am bad at dealing with compliments, 
  olympic games usually are a net loss , also , last olympic games in greece were , from an organizational point , a disaster, 
  the pledge of allegiance or u-s-a chanting is n't disturbing to germans only , just sayin ', 
  i wish you good luck in your next elections and a strong supreme court, 
  allright , got us , eu is actually really our attempt at the 4th reich , now please comply with our terms, 
  redditor for 7mins , troll confirmed, 
  maybe because he 's a pro-european and doing a decent job ? 
  german politicians also support politicians in other countries , especially during elections , does n't mean france or uk are german puppet states now, 
  idk where this `` german-puppet mentality '' comes from, 
  [ donald tusk , one of eu 's leading politicians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_tusk ), 
  turks in germany do all the exercising for you ;  ( and `` us '' ), 
  idk , i 've never seen as many people jog as when i was in london , but i ca n't speak for the rest of the country, 
  they are central like czechia !, 
  you are n't german puppets though, 
  you 're doing it wrong !, 
  you got ta wait till they are on sale for 66 % or more !, 
  but for most expensive game wow would take the cake for me i guess , probably also most time spent , though wc3 and d2 are other strong contenders, 
  or rice, 
  i 've spent less on games i 've spent more than 5k hours on, 
  gated behind dlc , not everyone will buy them . 
  maps as dlc is a horrible concept , it dilutes the playerbase, 
  you mean like [ this ] ( https://flushitblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/german-toilet.jpeg ) ? 
  they are pretty common in germany at least as well , i kinda like them , you get to admire your work and no splashes , and i always clean the toilet after shitting with the brush anyway . 
  also theres still some water on the `` top shelf '', 
  just wanted to say that it 's not only americans who do n't use water , you generally wo n't find a bidet in eastern europe , scandinavia , uk or germany, 
  you wo n't see this outside of the mediterranean area in europe either, 
  maybe he felt extra elevated because that 's how nobility was addressed, 
  stone tablets ?
