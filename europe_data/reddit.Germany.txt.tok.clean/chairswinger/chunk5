  i get my news from market screamers !, 
  maybe scotland should they leave , otherwise , you 're always welcome in germany , best start language courses now , 
  their `` french '' is an abomination, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/vqgso8_crio?t=5 ), 
  this is amazing , it 's almost 1:1, 
  i heard `` bl\u00f6de / dumme pute '' a few times , maybe it 's a regional thing ? 
  i 'm from nrw, 
  pute is also an insult in german , similar to bitch, 
  you are now persona non grata in the netherlands, 
   kacken lulul, 
  and fires . 
  thanks , corrected accordingly, 
  i 've seen a map a few months back where former yugoslavian countries were included , you smoked equal or more than turkey basically, 
  if you look at the polls by the most trustworthy , you can see germans are , in fact , the most compassionate !, 
  [ it 's a meme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawrlvoqqss&amp;ab_channel=mrboofie69 ), 
  can only give the german examples but there are likely more , we got arte ( france/germany ) , 3sat ( germany/austria/switzerland ) , deutsche welle ( dw ) ( though not really multinational as its only owned by the public broadcasting of germany ) and there were some other austrian/german ones which i forgot, 
  this is why i fail at spanish esta es por que yo fallo en espa\u00f1ol :(, 
  nahuatl , maya , protestantism and coptic are best !, 
  my friend told me something similar when he came back from ghana , people are ok with you as long as you believe in * anything * , could even be the flying spaghetti monster , but if you do n't believe in anything you 're regarded as weird, 
  there are already many multinational channels in europe , this would just be a step up, 
  '' ... ah yes , redditor otolia , sorry that would be 10.000 kronen '' * spits on him *, 
  when planes crash they do n't contaminate a large area around the crash site, 
  i 'm against the contamination of earth , water and air , this includes nuclear contamination , we already have other ways to generate electricity , we just need to fund them more and develop better ways of storing and stabilize the grid more, 
  go settle near fukushima and chernobyl then , mushrooms from eastern europe are still frowned upon in germany . 
  i would instantly dismiss all the german ones , as there have been multiple problems already and there is a lingering danger of them contaminating the groundwater , moreover of being in a comparatively densely populated area . 
  the ones in sweden and finland i could imagine being somewhat safe . 
  they 're still getting subsidised which will cost an estimate of around 100billion more until they 're shut . 
  german sources ok ? 
  cause i got plenty . 
  if wind turbines go wrong they do n't contaminate the whole area for centuries though, 
  idk germany alone has subsidised more than 200billion in nuclear power so far , nuclear energy is not economically viable, 
  [ about that desert ] ( http://cdn-9chat-fun.9cache.com/media/photo/amzdgqx91_480w_v1.jpg ) you may want to expel all vegans, 
  ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/935/573/a14.jpg ), 
  i 'm also against burning fossils, 
  thanks , so they 're also just joking, 
  idk , renewables produce way less , and if they would receive the massive funding nuclear power received and receives we could be much further ahead . 
  and if you bring in co2 released in the production of solar panels or installation of wind parks , mind i remind you that concrete is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions . 
  sex sells i guess, 
  is n't erdogan ignoring the protection ? 
  like with the new palace ? 
  brother, 
  rtl should be sentenced for their crimes against humanity, 
  while the risk of nuclear plants is rather low , when shit does go wrong it goes really wrong . 
  also , at least in europe , we do n't really have ways to safely store the waste and i 'm against dumping it all on somalia, 
  more like france , you 're terrifying, 
  imagine the coring cost now !, 
  can you elaborate ? 
  whenever i give away in online games i 'm german everyone makes nazi jokes , which i 've grown to be used to , but eastern europeans tend to rather write/say stuff like `` i love hitler haha '' and similar shit , my most recent example coming from a ukrainian and i ca n't really tell whether they 're joking, 
  [ reebook or nike ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4c54rcj_k&amp;ab_channel=psiaken ), 
  i 'll drink to that, 
  this was already good after 3secs , nice, 
  youtube germany is cancer though, 
  i think it 's one of the best, 
  though they taste different than in germany . 
  when i was in the us i brought some host presents ( ferrerro and haribo stuff ) and forgot the non-sweet presents . 
  turns out was n't a problem at all since they absolutely loved the gummi bears , even saying `` wow , they taste much fruitier than here '' . 
  in zoo, 
  oftentimes it 's that kids stop going to school after they 're 10 or 12 to go work and support the family , or never went to school at all . 
  also , school materials tend to be scarce or outdated , but it all depends on the country, 
  also pointing at germany while insulting france , nice to trigger 2 at once, 
  `` not one , not two but three mountains '' ryukyu intensifies, 
  who 's the vampire state now lol, 
  my parents still use it , they even use the desktop app that feels like it has n't been update in a decade d :, 
  what 's the secret to not getting a headache from slivovitz ? 
  holy shit :d, 
  not as bad as [ baia mare ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_baia_mare_cyanide_spill ) hopefully , though admittedly it does look kinda cool, 
  i 'll try but nothing of significance that has n't been spammed here has really happened . 
  ** germany ** * due to black ice earlier this week there were hundreds of accidents , but nobody was badly injured . 
  * air in cities is still way too polluted , biggest offenders being 1 . 
  stuttgart with 82microgram/m \u00b3 and munich with 80microgram/m \u00b3 , the green party demands that diesel cars be banned in favor of other drive technologies . 
  * bka ( our federal criminal police office ) revealed the data for rightwing attacks on asylums for 2016 , which amounted to 970 total , this includes smearing swastikas on them but the total number of assaults rose , though the number of arson attacks sank drastically compared to 2015 . 
  * new infighting within the afd : when the afd merged with another party in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , a delegate did n't sign a clause with which everyone had to distance themselves from anti-semitism and racism and after several pleads from his colleagues still refuses to . 
  he already made negative news by shouting `` volksverr\u00e4ter '' ( ~ * traitor of the people * ) in the local parliament . 
  * new realization in the case of the nsu murders ( also known under discriminating name of `` d\u00f6nermorde '' - '' * kebab killings * '' ) : a list containing the names and addresses of around 10.000 places in germany , which was found in the last hideout of the trio , has been analyzed and it included over 200synagogues , the list is heavily implied to be a list of potential targets . 
  the last surviving suspect ( 2/3 committed suicide ) always denied having played a role in the murders despite having helped the other 2 find a place to stay , staying with them and having managed their finances . 
  there is a testimony where a guard saw her lurking around one of the synagogues with another skinhead , believed to be one of the other 2 , probably spying on it . 
  with these realizations , it now seems clear that she was an equal part of the trio , having been involved in the planning of the attacks and while the final verdict is still far away , it seems that she will be getting lifelong sentence instead of just a few years . 
  * schulz ( for ) now in front merkel , you heard it already probably . 
  they 're considered a tax haven , kinda like netherlands , ireland and switzerland , that 's why many international corporations setup their european base in one of those countries and why other european countries want a euro-wide set tax, 
  that 's more of a german journalistic thing , and it is always put into relation , like in this example biggest and most significant * baroque residence * in * westphalia * . 
  also , in this example , it is actually pretty big , especially the gardens , you can only see a fraction of it on the pictures, 
  made me actually laugh :d yeah of course there are articles which are better in english than in german ( or any other language ) , i just wanted to point out that english is n't always better . 
  is that the benis : dddddd thing under the helmet ? 
  can the sz be both sharp and soft s ? 
  or do you have something like the germans with ss or \u00df ? 
  wtf ? 
  i know people who would define themselves as christians but basically hate the institution of the church, 
  there are also wikipedia articles that are vastly superior in their native language compared to english , my most recent example : * [ english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordkirchen_castle ) * [ original ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schloss_nordkirchen ), 
  sounds like a soft z https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/k%c3%b6sz%c3%b6n%c3%b6m rest how i would have expected it, 
  ha :d no it actually changes to the country 's name when you hover over the respective flag on the website , here you go http://everysecondcounts.eu/, 
  sit in a corner and pout !, 
  it was created in it 's likeness to mock it , back when it 's created , schulz ' chances of becoming chancellor were ~ 1 %, 
  they 're already here, 
  eh belgium had some good lines , too , and from my understanding , the belgian show is more of an acquired taste anyway, 
  but you 're third , you said it yourselves :d, 
  the eu cup win was still undeserved !, 
  ^ ^ inb4 ^ ^ triggered ^ ^ portuguese ^ ^ inc ^ ^ spamming ^ ^ caralho, 
  uhm there are subtitles in the video and most of it is translated in the article ? 
  but basically whether it is true that her bodyguard is her parliamentary assistant , he the gets pushed out , says they ca n't do this since he is allowed , has a journalist pass and all , security say he assaulted police,
