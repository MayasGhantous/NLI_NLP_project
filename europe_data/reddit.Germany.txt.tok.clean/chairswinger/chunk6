  in germany that 's called `` kalte muschi '' or `` cold pussy '' , but it 's not very popular, 
  can you read ? 
  they are sharing the intel concerning isis in non-kurdish areas, 
  eh , 50years too late for that , but we can make it better with the syrians now, 
  maybe slap a poem on top of it, 
  looks like it 's gon na be kettles , or do they still count to cattle ? 
  plus all those bonuses by any castle you own !, 
  glorious , does n't even need honor, 
  near the town i grew up in is a pretty close copy of versailles , with a few modifications , some local elements and smaller in scale . 
  * [ shitty english wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordkirchen_castle ) * [ glorious german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schloss_nordkirchen ) * [ google image search ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=schloss+nordkirchen&amp;rlz=1c1teua_ende453de453&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewicgmhzh-jrahviksakheaoa9uq_auibigb ), 
  just a small thing i disagree with :  ( in contrast with the french and german socialist movements , who were more in favor of the war ) . 
  the german socialist movement was strictly anti-war as well , or rather , not supporting this kind of war but rather a worldwide revolution , but the political class had little to do with the sentiments of the population, 
  wife spoke danish , i 'm confused, 
  what 's an indonesian doing in / r/europe ? 
  eh question is also asked more negatively , + we have a large portion of ethnic russians living in germany , but yeah , us government is n't really liked for ~ 15years, 
  keep your kids off the internet and out of the schools or we might educate them  :d, 
  though `` from poland '' is pretty debatable, 
  yes , from netherlands , france , germany , italy and the leftmost i ca n't really identify ( no particular order , the others ), 
  bunch of right-wing party leaders from different european countries, 
  sounds like a reason to party tbh i 'll prepare the beer, 
  to me , leipzig felt pretty sterile , it got funded a lot after the reunification , looks nice but feels kinda soulless, 
  i thought it 's when bavarians realize they 'll never be germans ? 
  well there 's 2 positions * she should n't have let so many in * the whole ordeal should have received way more funding and help so basically dont let people in or let more people in, 
  no no no , stealing jobs while also being unqualified / too stupid for any jobs, 
  wow good to know, 
  damn gay men outliving me !, 
  even though merkel is one of the few reasonable people within her party , i will never vote for that party ever in my life , so much shit done in it 's name . 
  green all the way , hate all you want . 
  i think i 've seen way more people going to the netherlands for beer simply because it does n't have a return fee attached , great for festivals, 
  if you dont mind headaches, 
  works in denglish , too . 
  i mean people are also painting insults or provocations on shells or bombs, 
  when we were building a swimming pool in our garden we dug up a wwii bomb , whole town had to be evacuated :d , was around 1995 ca n't find any sources anymore, 
  * every non-roman is a filthy barbarian * and german reich was n't the frontrunner in technology at all , nuh-uh, 
  nothing can stop the sandals and socks ^ tm, 
  i mean the original incident the breitbart article blew out of proportions was that a protective net on a scaffolding caught fire by 1 rocket , which can happen if thousands of people are partying . 
  of course they were handled differently . 
  dunno , church has n't been burned so i trust them that the church has n't been burned by hordes of muslims . 
  coincidentally , that 's the same church that was occupied by neonazis during the pre-christmas time to hang some banners with racial slurs . 
  they had to be forced out by the police . 
  if only their readers were fiction , too . 
  snitches get stitches !, 
  idk why we call some capitals by their actual names and some not . 
  and really arbitrary as well , like lissabon and athen, 
  ** timurids ** with revanchism still high from the lost wars my manpower had filled up rather fast and the horde , after first uniting through the hard times grew unruly again , so a war versus uzbek had to do . 
  muscovy and georgia declared separately and so uzbek was no match , after the war no longer being a worthy rival . 
  finally got a land connection to my last friendly horde friend , manchu , or should i say qing now ? 
  not even a horde anymore , even uses cannons !, 
  helped him with separatist and pretender movements during his civil war and bankruptcy and let myself get called into another ming war , where i could n't help as much as i wanted ( 10 % participation ) because an opportunity rose up in the west . 
  invited to a plot to curb ottoman dominance , got some alliance offers from former allies/rivals and waited for a good moment when the ottoman forces were occupied elsewhere . 
  quickly sieged down the euphrat/tigris delta but then it went just back and forth around baghdad . 
  won some major battles , one was extremely [ close ] ( http://imgur.com/ahv0l1q ) but in the final days of the battle , the rolled in our favour . 
  after this battle moroccow as willing to white peace , georgia and tunis had already been white peaced so now ottomans started sending peace offers but we had plans concerning egypt so we needed to siege down el ` karak in the mountains to give it to oman . 
  but it was in vain , as the omani leadership did n't want a province they had a claim on ... another unfortunate happening was that the moment i sent a peace offer ( 86 ) to ottomans he unconditionally surrendered , so now there are still timurid cores on ottoman lands . 
  malwa was the mvp of this war . 
  took new loans to embrace this thing called * colonialism * and am closing in on great power status again , 4 development difference to majapahit , and now the * printing press * has spawned in some insignificant land . 
  reminder oman lost 2 battles vs maldives and needed ajuraan to win vs a 6 dev opm :d, 
  the invasion is already undergoing , all * european beaches belong to germany ( * some exceptions ), 
  ribbentrop 2 obviously, 
  czechs are just afraid of clowns, 
  there had been channels since the 14th century though, 
  happens quite often though, 
  [ it 's not easy if you 're dumb ] ( https://pics.me.me/dap-hail-hortler-7463359.png ), 
  you underestimate our education system . 
  though , of course , some can still be done just to be edgy, 
  one day a fertility map will be about crop yield, 
  no offense but that 's a kinda weird selection of countries and i presume the rest shall be included in `` europe '' . 
  one would think countries with higher population like italy or spain would get precedence over smaller ones , but maybe ltur does n't operate in them ? 
  no idea, 
  czech republic is nowhere close to balkans though ? 
  they * do * often get associated with eastern europe which they do n't want, 
  i guess that 's one way to look it at , but i think neither western europe nor eastern europe is fitting for germany which is why i prefer to look at it geographically , where eastern europe means ukraine , belarus and the likes, 
  you never were !, 
  slovenia central confirmed, 
  i can understand them being unknown outside of europe, 
  this thread is fucked, 
  iceland has no army and still is in nato , no bitching there, 
  wait they are unknown ? 
  it 's just bants, 
  did n't you give your throne to the duke of saxony ? 
  they were mostly in germany, 
  i mean those camps had been used to kill political opposition and disabled people before that, 
  ew , [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/9a/04/f5/9a04f55c580019d1cfdfb2b8eedb7f2d.jpg ) is how i will remember him, 
  are we though ? 
  maybe in 2010, 
  holy shit do they look like fishermen, 
  but it was the 3:2 , conceding a goal in extra time can have devastating effects on morale and performance, 
  pride in a fake goal , what are you ? 
  original argentina ? 
   we 'd never let them live that shit down . 
  oh i know , without wwii the uk would have nothing to boast about, 
  would have been dissolved after the war anyway, 
  itt : `` i voted no because germany '' lul k lets just leave and you federalise without us : ^ ), 
  yeah thinking about getting one in the future, 
  damn what difficulty setting was that ? 
  in more than 1000 hours i 've never seen ai form bharat, 
  half their party is still lunatics . 
  i actually agree with them on many points but their foreign policy and some other parts of their program make them unvotable for me, 
  why do you hate the sea so much,
