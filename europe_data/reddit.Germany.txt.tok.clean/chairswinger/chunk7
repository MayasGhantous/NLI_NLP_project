  bunch of people from r/europe want to play eu4 in big multiplayer rounds , this is the 3rd campaign,

  * i want simpler times back where we treated sickness by eating roots , cutting our wrists or dying *, 
  am scatologist , can confirm, 
  from what i 've gathered germany has a different idea of eurobonds as the rest , and germany has the support of other countries like netherlands , estonia or austria, 
  yeah but hanse was mostly german cities and merchants so to look ungerman they maybe should n't have tried that look, 
  under certain circumstances it 's the logical step , no common fiscal policy is one of the euros biggest drawbacks , but this wo n't happen with the current state of affairs, 
  90 % of vice germany seems to be `` how i worked as a sex worker/escort etc '', 
  unsurprising for the rebranded sed, 
   the reconstruction was not tied to the city 's pre-war appearance , but instead was politically motivated as a means of culturally cleansing and destroying all traces of german influence from the city . 
  though personally in my eyes they failed , looks very similar to rostock or l\u00fcbeck, 
  tbh palace interiors of all eras are fucking ugly, 
  good luck convincing the northern countries, 
  [ nah looks good ] ( https://fussball-fanshop-bilder.de/bilder/bvb-schal-traditionsverein-z1.jpg ), 
  nah he 's been lifting bruh, 
  what if they were sold so they could afford a ticket to get the hell out of europe ? 
  most of those books are from germany though, 
  morning , huh ? 
  * looks out of window * shit , time for bed, 
  allegedly an ex party man from vietnam has been kidnapped in berlin by the vietnamese secret service . 
  he was dragged forcefully into a car on july 23rd and has been arrested in vietnam on july 31st , where he allegedly turned himself in . 
  he had applied for asylum in germany , the process had n't been completed by the time he was kidnapped . 
  he had left vietnam after he had been seen driving a luxury car , which is frowned down upon by communist party officials , then the chief of the kp said he 's gon na investigate this guy , after which he left vietnam . 
  then the vietnamese government accused him to have caused losses worth of 125million $ while being the head of a subsidiary of the national gas and oil company petrovietnam, 
  yes , this one is kinda ugly , besides the diagonal stripes are used in a few african nations so not really exclusive as well, 
  i just realised i know nothing about fico, 
  so jealous , i hate how cities are built around cars, 
  i mean you can take my coast but that does n't float well with the ottomans, 
  why die for danzig ? 
  [ dumb british blonde fucks 15 million people at once ] ( https://i.redd.it/lqalqm2en86x.png ) ( nsfw sort of ), 
  nah just stalemate , muscovy and ottomans but poland/lithuania with bohemia and hungary, 
  yay , my own fanclub :d,

  i declined a deal with him , he prepared for war , some allies broke their alliance with me on their own , some i advised they better break now to not get prestige hit , unless they want to fight ( but those that did not break on their own were in no position anyway ) . 
  then struck a different deal with ottomans , even more favourable to him but he wanted a pretend war to let everyone think we were enemies . 
  during the war i get offers from france and england , the court of ulugh begh is far reaching . 
  this , of course , cancels any deals with the ottomans and furthermore allowed ming to intervene on the ottoman side . 
  the westerners slowly move their troops to greece , but some unfortunate battles and no hope of winning make them peace out . 
  meanwhile those that i helped declare war on me , delhi , malwa and ajuraan go for the killing blow , somehow the knights joined my side for jerusalem ( which they briefly held ) but then the ottomans turn their attention on the knights , wanting to absorb them , so i forfeit and force him to offer me peace within the next months so he ca n't take land from the order . 
  then accept peace from delhi for my indian holdings + a bit of afghanistan and that 's it . 
  at times i was at war with ottomans , ming , delhi ( + jangladesh and what other vassals ) , ajuraan , malwa ( + bengal , gondwana and what other vassals ) . 
  honestly expected the newly formed bharat as well . 
  not gon na quit though , new friends will find themselves ( please ) betrayal counter : ~ ~ iiii ~ ~ ( only counting those i 've been at war at ) betrayed : 0 i guess i know my problem :(, 
  i do n't fully understand it but some dutch and lower saxony chicken farms had eggs contaminated with fipronil , lots of stores destroyed all their eggs . 
  be careful and maybe read local news , they were exported into other countries as well,

  noo please stay away , we still have a semblance of `` normal '' city centre , aside from the cathedral plateau, 
  not mongolia though, 
   certainly not enough to warrant a few `` grabbing popcorns '' posts even before there are any comments discussing the topic at hand . 
  what 's the point of grabbing popcorn after the show ?

  maybe they wrongly translated it into english ?

  the following propaganda battle was a complete british victory though . 
  it is actually argued that this led to a short increase in the spanish fleet quality as many outdated or unfit ships were replaced , the real blow coming when the dutch raided the spanish coast and setting many new ships on fire . 
  building a new fleet twice is kinda expensive, 
  black zero though, 
  the german one is wrong , it 's actually `` ich find dich geil '' jk on a serious note , the phonetic translation is wrong , that would be how a french with heavy accent sounds like, 
  i also really liked the [ outro song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opmhpg3vlda&amp;ab_channel=littlebubbel ) in german, 
  i always hate these because most countries are a shit canvas, 
  eeeh pretty sure we had democracy here as well . 
  and we do n't necessarily want out of nato , just get the nukes out of here,

  algae can suffocate the local fauna by sucking the oxygen out of the water , but not sure if that 's possible in the adriatic sea , i mean it is rather narrow and not * that * deep . 
  but i heard this happening in lakes as well so could probably happen , would lead to the fauna either moving or dying . 
  the romans really were great builders,
