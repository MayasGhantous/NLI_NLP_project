  if hitler were n't excluded in our version he might have had a chance as well , but then again it was called `` unsere besten '' ( * our best * ) so probably not, 
  code civil  sun, 
  jan zizka over jan hus ? 
  ooh glad to see dvorak and smetana so far up, 
  barbarossa was actually very unimpressive and unsuccesful . 
  i mean when the only thing you 're remembered for was having a red beard, 
  he was neither and both, 
  would still be hitler :d, 
  yeah we had literally hundreds of concentration camps all across europe , but what when you want to specify talking about the ones in poland ? 
   if you are smart and clever enough , you will find who and why brought this controversy up . 
  they did that for a reason you talking about agency 114 or tandera ? 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/v6tub6rng7q?t=214 ) is the docu in question , with the approximate time stamp . 
  '' . . on their way they have already liberated concentration and annihilation camps in poland '' . 
  wow what grand historical revisionism , reason enough to go to court and then deem [ this ] ( https://www.zdf.de/doku-wissen/richtigstellung-tendera-102.html ) apology for a non-mistake not according to court ruling . 
  but yeah whatever you wan na believe, 
  being in nato has n't stopped the usa from planning coups , ask greece for example, 
  so there were no death camps in poland ? 
  we would also like to get rid of all foreign nukes from our soil, 
  the pull factor will always be there as long as we enjoy this prosperity . 
  in the future you can add a lush nature to this when water gets even scarcer, 
  look at the distance difference between tunisia or libya and lampedusa and compare it to australia, 
  hmm iirc since 2016 you can go to prison in poland for up to 3 years if you use the phrase `` polish death camp '', 
  may be because italy is n't really advertised as party tourism here, 
  are you on mobile ? 
  maybe it 's my flair , it shows as a flag on pc . 
  i do n't use reddit on mobile , ca n't tell you how to get a flair there , but on desktop its on the right sidebar, 
  germans say both,

  he did n't mean the us but the pronoun us, 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#foreign_nationals_in_germany ) you fucks, 
  flags at half post / mast whatever mean mourning . 
  well the james pronunciation does give me a chuckle every time :d . when i first saw him on a team `` huh weird name for a colombian , maybe immigrant parents '' * hears announcer say his name * `` that 's even weirder '' i think this \u03b8 is the correct ipa symbol for the c in barcelona ? 
  cant find the correct one for how my mexican spanish tutor said it but basically sharp s instead , sounded nicer to me, 
   complain  almost no german tourists what . 
  1st who wants more german tourists and 2nd calabria is very popular among elderly germans , mainly for hiking, 
  and therefore , very gorgeous, 
  idk , my spanish is awful anyway , but i prefer to hear `` barsselona '' instead of `` barfelona '', 
  pls no, 
  population control, 
  man i could really use some holidays, 
  oh man , poor turks . 
  this is worse than hungary and soros, 
  polish commanders as well, 
  that 's an oxymoron . 
  besides this fine specimen here promotes lies like `` germans and austrians be careful : in your countries the slightest glorification of hitler can lead to a jail sentence ! '', 
  have n't seen it , from the trailer it looks all right , maybe a bit too much of the `` simple soldiers were just following orders and not ideological '' but i ca n't really say that without having seen it, 
  i often dislike the depiction of both the allies and the nazis . 
  few films get this right . 
  and most films are shit anyway . 
  ( do n't wan na give promotion to rightwing channels but ) [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8radpasvq0&amp;ab_channel=r%c3%98lg ) video is kinda interesting where hitler contemplates on the decision to attack the soviet union . 
  ( as always , do n't read the comments ), 
  it 's the `` s '' sound instead of the `` th '' sound that makes me prefer latin american variations, 
  r/spain is for foreigners/tourists , r/es is for spain and spaniards if i got that right . 
  spanish people tend to not be so well versed in english so they are not that active on reddit ( correct me if i 'm wrong d , 
  got royally fucked in the civil war and was testing ground for german air raids . 
  despite a non-intervention treaty , italy and germany sided with the fascists under franco form day 1 basically , delivering arms and ammunition as well as fighting forces . 
  the soviet union sided with the republicans , the rest did basically nothing , many other countries governments feared communism and had larger fascist movements in their own country . 
  soviet support turned out to be really shit , with officers killing anarchists and other leftist followers which did n't align with bolshevism and basically draining the whole gold reserve of spain . 
  now here is something i 'm not really sure of , i heard the catholic church had the monopoly on education before the civil war and mostly indoctrinated the population , with spain having a much higher illiteracy rate than other european countries at the time and this kinda continued under franco , can anyone confirm/deny/explain ? 
  the rhetoric of western germany being nazi germany was under gdr rule . 
  the younger generation still has many neo nazis and some football clubs are known for their fan groups , but there are also counter movements forming . 
  still , there 's not being done enough to change this . 
  on a similar note , my hometown had many riverarms going through it , both gymnasiums were next to a river . 
  in winter they would sometimes freeze and then some kids would go to school by ice skating, 
  isar is actually quite clean and well liked among surfers, 
  blame the vienesse !, 
  i say we gulag them, 
  gdr mostly . 
  [ some parts of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tal_der_ahnungslosen ) could n't receive western media , which was trusted way more than gdr media , so those parts are called `` valley of the clueless '' since they were mostly fed lies . 
  another part is , the denazification forced upon by the occupants was pretty fruitless in both parts . 
  in western germany , this led to the 68 revolts because the new generation was disgusted by their previous ones lack of acknowledgement which led to the standard of denazification we see in most germany today , whereas revolts were not really a thing in autocratic gdr . 
  then there 's also the whole narrative of western germany being the continuation of nazi germany , being filled with nazis ( hence why the official name of the berlin wall was `` anti-faschistischer schutzwall - anti-fascist protection wall '' so they themselves ca n't possibly be nazis, 
  ( we 're mostly non-rhotic language ), 
  endless like russia 's borders ? 
  know that feel, 
  you 're 10 years old ? 
  unlikely, 
  nippy . 
  kind . 
  lol so distracted by an ass :d, 
  that 's some nice asses right there in the 2nd pic, 
  could the legends be true ? 
  germany is n't western europe so why would czechia be ? 
  central europe is a good place to be anyway, 
  ** timurids ** through sudden lack of leadership in the uzbek horde , we suddenly found ourselves rivaled by our former ally . 
  but our indian ambitions seem to advance nicely . 
  when we reduced our interest rate by 1 our treasury had black numbers for the first time ever !, 
  now it 's only going to take 100 years to pay those loans back . 
  since there was no real room for expansion i `` forced '' my neighbours to call me into their wars so i can loot some provinces to keep the horde unity up , from alexandria to xi'an the timurid hordes looted provinces . 
  entered an alliance with the formerly disloyal tributary oman , secured him the mamluk lands of arabia and dealt with the resulting separatist movements , hopefully gaining loyalty this time, 
  nazi hunts are common in germany for a long time , it 's cultural, 
  it 's no problem because we like each other , right neighbours ? 
  ... right ? 
  it was a weird time , france fully claimed charlemagne for themselves at the time and built new statues,
