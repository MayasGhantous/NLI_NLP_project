  `` conquer '', 
  i mean that 's the direction the romans were coming from, 
  so sad they split but the [ new song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkbadvamuxo&amp;ab_channel=nuclearblastrecords ) seems promising for the upcoming album, 
  very informative and nicely formatted , thank you, 
  a great thing for sweden , and therefore , the world, 
  somehow the french or polish go apeshit if we call it * elsass-lothringen * or * danzig , stettin *, 
  true on both accounts , but netflix , hbo , sky , its all the same to us poorbois ( i know made by arte ) . 
  the essence is we knew what he meant, 
  [ stop ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puszxecs0mm&amp;ab_channel=soma ), 
  yes, 
  calling australia 's immigration policy * fair * is a bit of a stretch , besides , they are in the fucking ocean, 
  [ how lucky we are to only fight battles in football nowadays ] ( http://frankfurt.international/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/deutschland-frankreich.jpg ), 
  oh fought ? 
  huh not sure , but lived through it , some . 
  tbh i think it was just false promises to get more fighting men on their side, 
  germany , of course , as is tradition, 
  nah willy is the nickname for kaiser wilhelm ii hohenzollern . 
  the pictures are from before wwi, 
  enemies to the north , enemies to the east , enemies to the south , enemies to the west , i hate myself, 
  ah sorry had this tab open for a while, 
  probably the least integrated group in germany, 
  amsterdam would like to disagree, 
  thanks , hitler , willy and britain, 
  just a different language , or are you gon na start calling our city names by their * actual * names ? 
  yes , 4, 
  proximity to russia is one factor, 
  before wwi they used to be one of the richest countries , having higher gdp than switzerland , spain , france iirc, 
  ukrainians also started meddling with the current pipeline before the ukraine conflict, 
  it 's ok , its purpose is to keep foreigners out of the real sub so you not knowing means it still kinda works, 
  ye quite well defined, 
  the content is not decided by politicians though , so public broadcast would be better, 
  we have similar ads all over germany . 
  now i 'm no expert but i think most advertise themselves as some `` men 's club '' or `` sauna club '', 
  holy shit that 's trashy, 
  probably because not everyone accepts it to be independent, 
  please qualify , it 's been years :(, 
  the og fanta with milk is quite tasty, 
  the only mass hysteria i see is from eastern europeans, 
  depends on the part of germany : , 
  * fuck the eu *, 
  well we have thousands of castles with complete interior , ca n't force the tourists there if they do n't want ( btw they still do , just not on the same scale or even from other countries ), 
  chichen itza does n't give tile based bonuses though ? 
  or are you talking about civ vi ? 
  i mean when you look at the context , it was referring to `` majdanek and auschwitz '' , considering we had many more concentration camps in different countries one could argue this was for specification . 
  these videos are always so weird as a german , probably the same for the `` issou '' one and spanish speakers, 
  [ that 's the tragedy of news only reporting about flint ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/flint_water_crisis#lead_poisoning_and_aging_infrastructure_problems_in_other_cities ) there are * many * more cases like this, 
  single incidents vs a widespread problem , flint is by far not the only case, 
  now you resort to victim blaming just wow !, 
  i just wanted to make a dumb joke about the authors name :(, 
  well it 's their turn to know the feeling for once, 
  i heard they smoke quite a lot in serbia and montenegro, 
  i thought it was pretty fresh, 
  can confirm, 
  german history and cultural difference go back longer than that unification though, 
  what is this * belgian * ? 
  ** timurids ** india block still going strong , no way to form the mughals . 
  helped my horde bro uzbek by giving him some provinces so he can form bukhara when he feels like it and embrace feudalism . 
  great horde had to be abandoned , sadly , but found new horde bro in manchu . 
  i connected to ming so their mandate drops faster , manchu did a good job crippling ming with some other help . 
  took the last provinces from qara qoyunlu that was agreed upon with the ottomans , leaving a quite nice [ border ] ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285115692095897601/338759418957135873/eu4_map_smz_1481_01_14_1.png ) ( current world map ) . 
  removed some heirs and now hope my current one becomes an adult before the current khan dies . 
  heard some talk about big wars in europe but its all shrouded to me . 
  at least no backstabs this time, 
  same !, 
  no one does though, 
  shh is ok bby, 
  btw if you do n't wan na use german loan words , you can always use french ones , in the uk they say cr\u00e8che or nursery :d, 
  worked once but maybe keep bulgaria out of it this time, 
  how is this valid to reject citizenship ? 
  i have read multiple such occurrences already , also with an american guy who lived there for like 12 years, 
  or expat bubbles, 
  first invasion was justified , 2nd not so much, 
  well that 's what it basically was before it started losing territory, 
  probably same with the `` habsburg '' written over multiple countries, 
  can still vote from outside of poland, 
  picasso gets praised, 
  decriminalised drugs , invest more in drug treatment and drug prevention, 
  wait we have liberal drug policy ? 
  of course, 
  bonus if you say those things with german or russian flair, 
  was that post maybe on / r/shitwehraboossay ? 
  this , but unironically, 
  really ? 
  it 's been on basically every news or tv show , from kika over galileo to tagesschau . 
  it 's pretty dope but crowded , it 's in hamburg, 
  after wwii many polish regiments were under uk command , when russia annexed eastern poland they left many of them homeless , they did n't want to return so they stayed in the uk , which led to the polish resettlement act in 1947 . around 200k poles settled in the uk back then . 
  another big wave came after poland 's entry to the eu in 2004 . 
  still not as many as in germany though :d, 
  damn she speaks pretty good , the content is weird though, 
  this is the government institution i trust the most , by far, 
  oh man those south arctic waters, 
  i looked into it and made an internship . 
  it 's 10 % teaching and 90 % raising kids . 
  the kids are generally nice and love you but the curriculum is just so dull so i chose different school form, 
  bro they hold the record for the worlds longest grudge , the dammaz kron has nothing on them, 
  save your sanity and do n't argue with hungarians about this, 
  well everyone can have dual citizenship when one of your parents was german or has lived here for 8years, 
  ye we have around 5million dual citizens in germany , most are poles , russians and turks , they can vote in both countries . 
  dual citizenship was only allowed in 2000 , before that we only had jus sanguinis , meaning people who had at least 1 german parent ( at birth ) got it automatically and to apply for german citizenship you had to have lived for 15 years in germany . 
  in 2000 some birthplace factor got added in : if a parent has lived in germany for 8years already and has permanent residence allowed , the child gets citizenship automatically , furthermore the 15year rule got lowered to 8years .
