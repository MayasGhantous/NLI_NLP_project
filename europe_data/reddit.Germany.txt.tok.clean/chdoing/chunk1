* german - native * english - thanks to internet , programming , games and university teaching it * bad french - at least if have a certificate saying so  * can understand basic written dutch by guessing words and grammer * vb.net , c # , some java , html , css , javascript , ruby , xml , json , etc. 
  - all of them are programming/markup languages i use to create software, 
  `` error 403 - forbidden '' . 
  seems like there is something wrong with your link :|, 
  the romans already new this . 
  you keep your subjects * fed * ( so they wo n't riot ) and * away from information * , through games ( so they wo n't hate you and riot because of that ) . 
  all modern politicians did was adding to the second part : make the subjects * think they know * whats going on but keep them * uninformed * at the same time . 
  so even those who resist `` honey boo boo '' still wo n't riot . 
  now that you have subject how do n't riot you can * do whatever you please * . 
  you get filthy rich . 
  your friends get filthy rich . 
  you invade peoples privacy . 
  noone cares . 
  you can even make them want the cctv camera in their homes ( just call it `` cinnect '' and ship it with the xbox ) . 
   creative activity deserves special protection against theft as it `` allows society to advance '' this is actually not that easy . 
  as a programmer i understand the effort that goes into making something and the desire to be rewarded ( in money ) . 
  but on the other hand i see major game companies deliver the crappiest and overprized programs i ever encountered . 
  i would be fired if i would ever deliver software as buggy as some modern ( and older ) games ( example : bethesdas skyrim still has bugs that could easily be fixed - modders did that already ) . 
  otherwise : who cares ? 
  i do n't ... 
  not those from the middle east :p, 
  i do n't fear migrants themselfs . 
  i fear what sdpecifically muslims will do to our country : * many rely on wealfare but only very few pay anything to support the wellfare * most do n't care for our culture * many do n't care when we say `` no '' - they try everything to illigally get into our country * most do n't seem to be above the rules or law * our government has turned their brains off ( at least it looks like that ) and lets them do as they please * there are individuals who are [ serious danger ] ( https://www.reddit.com/live/wmk50bsm9vt3 ) * we opened the border to f * ucking everyone . 
  what better could terrorists wish for !? 
  a hand full of them is enough to blow up several people ( look at the news ! ) . 
  so you only need about 0.00001 % of migrants to be terrorists for that to be a massive threat !, 
  kids with blonde hair . 
  i sadly have to report that the gymnasium i went to had very few of these . 
  most kids have an eastern backgroud . 
  those from eastern eurpoe ( mostly ) behave well , others - most of which are turkey/middle east - are absolute assholes . 
   dear liberal pro-immigrant social work student , please explain to me how this particular type of immigrant helps me or my country ? 
  why should i want them here ? 
  i should realy ask our student parliament about this . 
  though i propably will be called nazi ( again ) . 
  without english you are f * cked in my profession ( it ) 2 . 
  they either have careers where they do n't need english or get by well without . 
  after all they are [ not ] ( https://youtu.be/llygpwq0vjy?t=17s ) [ alone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuybmcck2rk )  3 . 
  except for some jobs english is not used in day-to-day live . 
  only some jobs - like it - need english everyday . 
  schools teach english but not nearly enough for people to properly learn from them . 
  / germany, 
   post-war refugees [ ... ] being resettled before wwii people were german citizens , speaking german , raised under german culture , following german law , having the same education as every other german . 
  how can you compare them to random people claiming to be syrians ( without proof non the less !, 
  ) , * not * speaking german , raised under muslim culture ( at least there claims suggest that ) , shitting on german law ( telling police in the face `` you ca n't touch me , ms. merkel invited me ! '' ), 
  and lacking the level of education that is standard in germany !? 
  the answer is simple : * you ca n't !, 
  as ridiculous as it sounds : yes . 
  the moment someone can add malware / run a ddos attack against a gadget you have to have protection . 
  it is crazy , but the more useless computers are uselessly connected to the internet the more we will have to spend on protecting them against people who want to abuse them . 
  once a country stops properly verifing who enters is in fact `` giving the green light '' to everybody . 
  that includes refugees , migrants , tourists , crimals - literally everybody in the world . 
  also what do you think beeing stuck means ? 
  it is in fact that they stay in germany as their home country does not want them back ( aparently some `` refugees '' even lied about beeing from syria ) . 
  so it does not matter wether they are stuck , granted asylum or slow down the process ( many law students have been or are still providing legal assistence and thus help slow down desicion making ) - in the end they all are living in germany . 
  as a programmer i sort of have to go with computer scientists  * [ charles babbage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_babbage ) invented a steam-powered mechanical computer which never took off . 
  * [ ada lovelace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ada_lovelace ) discovered the potential of babbages machine . 
  * [ konrad zuse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_zuse ) build the first programmable computer in the world . 
  * [ john von neumann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_von_neumann ) invented the von-neumann-architecture which is the basic structure ( many ) modern computers use . 
  while his work in while in the us is most famous , he was born in hugary and worked in berlin aswell as zurich . 
  * [ edsger w. dijkstra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edsger_w._dijkstra ) helped shape the subject of theoretical computer science and designed many algorithms we use today . 
  * [ sir timothy john berners-lee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tim_berners-lee ) invented http ( the language of the world wide web ) while at cern and heads the w3c ( the organisation making the standards powering the internet ) . 
  * [ sophie wilson ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sophie_wilson ) created the arm instruction set . 
  today arm-architecture cpus power basically every smartphone on the market . 
  i think that if babbage would have managed to sell his machine ms. lovelace would be much better known . 
  there are others of course : * [ wernher magnus maximilian freiherr von braun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wernher_von_braun ) ended up working for nasa and worked on the saturn v booster - which powering apollo rockets . 
  * [ wilhelm r\u00f6ntgen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilhelm_r%c3%b6ntgen ) discovered x-rays . 
  * [ karl friedrich benz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_benz ) , [ gottlieb wilhelm daimler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gottlieb_daimler ) , [ wilhelm maybach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilhelm_maybach ) , [ nikolaus otto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikolaus_otto ) , [ ferdinand porsche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_porsche ) and [ rudolf diesel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudolf_diesel ) all worked on various combustion engines . 
  * [ johannes gutenberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johannes_gutenberg ) invented the printing press , starting the mass production of written texts . 
  * [ heinrich rudolf hertz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinrich_hertz ) proved the existance of electromagnetic waves . 
  i know diffie hellman ( my crypto prof explained that often enough ) . 
  the problem with whatsapp is that ** the client is not trustworthy ** . 
  you can not be sure that the client keeps you key a secret . 
  even doing ** diffie hellman is no use if your client shares the key ** . 
  we do not know if whatsapp shares the key with the server !, 
  the protocol does not matter at all . 
  ** the fundamental weakness of encryption is that anyone with the key can read the message !, 
  that is how encryption is designed to work !, 
  ** ** whatsapp knows your key ** . 
  you can not be sure wether it transfers that key somewhere to facebook so that they have it aswell . 
  that means they can read the message . 
  ** the protocol used to send the message does not matter !, 
  ** facebook can have the key if they want and therefor read the message if they want to . 
  and their software has the key used for encryption and decryption . 
  they can just read that whenever they want - just noone else can . 
  then ** he ** shall show mercy ** first ** !, 
  he shall take in as many refugees as possible . 
  once he did that he can tell us how he deals with all the side effects : many unemployed and bored people that do n't even get along in their own countries all forced in a small space will end in fights and wounded ; not to speak of the several coordinated terror attacks we saw in the last couple weeks ) . 
  if he would share his solution all of europe would benefit from that !, 
  fitting , 
  [ a quick search ] ( http://graphemica.com/%d1%be ) says : ` cyrillic capital letter ot ` , unicode code point ` u +047 e ` , 
  if gema finds out today there will be trouble for youtube today . 
  so youtube blocks it as long as the label has the rights to that song - which is practically forever ... 
  it 's greed + power that rules gema in their desicions . 
  the only hope is to get an [ alternative ] ( https://www.c3s.cc ) - but that probably wo n't be a thing any time soon :(, 
   please tell which employee gives a fuck have you ever worked while tired . 
  even if you do n't give a fuck about your productivity it will be affected : you will make more mistakes . 
  a single srew up can , depending on you job , kill someone ( e.g. 
  doctor doing surgery ) , make you or a college fix it or destroy hours worth of work ( e.g. 
  to be clear , i know the gitlab incident happended independent of clock changes but it is a tired employee deleting 6 hours worth of other peoples work . 
  so it still applies as an example of tiredness related problems .
