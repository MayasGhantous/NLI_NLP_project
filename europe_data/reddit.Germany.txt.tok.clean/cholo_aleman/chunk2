  right [ here ] ( http://www.gfk-geomarketing.de/fileadmin/newsletter/pressemitteilung/kaufkraft-europa2011.html ) ( in german ) added info ( in english ) : http://www.gfk-geomarketing.de/en/market_data/market_data_by_theme/purchasing_power.html, 
  i was aware of the tsochatzopoulos case , but had missed mantelis . 
  as to christoforakos : german courts have already ruled on the matter and have decided that the statute of limitations on this case has passed . 
  this means two things : a ) he has been tried and convicted in this matter , so it is unlikely that another trial on the same matter will happen , and b ) since that is the case , he can not be held by german authorities to be extradited to greece , since that would essentially violate his civil liberties just to be clear : i 'm not trying to defend siemens , i am merely pointing out that the case is not nearly as cut-and-dry as it would seem . 
  the moral imperative ( i.e. 
  `` they * should * do this . . '' ) doesnt cut it . 
  soooo ... how many greek officials connected to the siemens case have been tried and convicted yet ? 
  if we do n't give them christoforakos , we may just break international law . 
  no legal action can be instituted twice for the same criminal action . 
  since this concept is part of the schengen treaty ( art . 
  54 f ) to which both countries have agreed to , i would assume that an extradition in this case would be contested in court ( with a few exceptions , of course ) . 
  you seem angry . 
  you should lie down . 
  [ hair implant science ] ( http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2008/0811/berlusconi_gaffe_1111.jpg ), 
  good one !, 
  most of them either could not compete , or were bought up by competitors ( and were then gutted ) or took decades to become viable as capitalist enterprises . 
  they were however not liquidated . 
  oh , he 's still [ around ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/christopherwalkenfeb08.jpg ) . 
  so fail right there . 
  ( still the only * real * bond , even at 81 ), 
  what has james bond ever done for europe ? 
  you 've basically described every other youtube video out there . 
  a bit of [ context ] ( http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=1050231&amp;c=1 ) . 
  there has already been a [ protest ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/society/20120629-43465.html ) about this but gema appears unconcerned . 
  to pay the interest , i presume ? 
  linkspam . 
  could n't we just have replaced `` a greek exit from the eurozone '' with a deep , drawn out sigh ? 
  no comment from you on greek debt ? 
  you 're slipping , dude . 
  holding a grudge , are we ? 
  she seems to be of the george w. bush school of political philosophy : ` you are either with me , or against me ' . 
  given your demeanor on here it is surprising to me that people actually want to be your friend . 
  but then again , this is facebook , where even [ marmite ] ( http://www.facebook.com/marmite ) can have friends . 
   anyone who thinks this might work , would . 
  yes , deranged people would think that . 
  that 's why the rest of us do n't do it . 
  they made everyone in europe take off their hats and took a picture from space . 
  and as [ this comment ] ( http://de.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/vmb3a/eu_commissioner_reveals_he_will_simply_ignore_any/c55q0u2 ) shows , your distrust in this instance is completely unfounded . 
  whatever you say , [ walter ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjgkkodvrx4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=18s ) . 
   goldman sach 's i think you meant [ gold mansacks ] ( http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=goldman%20sach's&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0ciqbebywaw&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fgoldman_sachs&amp;ei=h0xot4wjj8xnswa3-ptoaq&amp;usg=afqjcnfkre6fchsjbwihmfsve_g75xcz5a ) . 
  yes . 
  it 's always better to immediately start bombing , then invent a reason for bombing ( like - say - weapons of mass destruction ) , only to find out later that that reason was bogus . 
   if a rather large mob ( make it as large as you want ) of people came upon a business and demanded that the business start to conduct business a certain way or they would start taking money out of the pocket of the business owner , and kidnap him if he refused to continued to refused , the police would of course be expected to arrest the mob because the mob has no right to expect the business owner to start doing thing the way the mob wants . 
  that would be an oversimplification . 
  even antitrust laws would fall under that example . 
  the law at its very basic interpretation is put in place to protect society from undesired or actions that are harmful . 
  net neutrality , as i understand it , is there to ensure equal * access * to information . 
  nobody owns the internet , therefore property rights are n't affected . 
  providers are paid bandwidth , not content . 
  net neutrality is there to ensure that telcoms , whose business it is to provide the infrastructure and the services to communicate on the internet , do not restrict or distort the access to said content . 
  so no , the property is not being infringed upon by net neutrality . 
  just imagine if your telephone company ( in most cases the same party that delivers your internet access ) restricted the range of numbers you could call on your telephone . 
  want to call grandma ? 
  same thing on the internet : your provider should not have the right to charge you a premium for something thatdoesnt require them more effort to produce . 
  this has nothing to do with them charging for bandwidth - technical expenses should obviously be paid . 
  the thing is most people dont care as long as their lives are not adversely affected . 
  there 's the crux . 
  * people * in general dont want much , much less something intangible as the eu . 
  very few of them actually get involved in this debate and are knowledgeable enough to make an informed decision . 
  plus , for the political elites it is always more costly ( speaking in terms of political capital ) to advocate more integration . 
  anti-europe parties will always have an easier game because they are proposing to fall back on state models that alredy exist , so they wont have to takea gamble . 
  edit : to illustrate my point - and also because it is sunday - here is someting from the only marx i find agreeable : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7cry-4pyy8, 
  a master of words he is not . 
  everyone should . 
  no one does . 
  fwiw , everyone should also read douglas adams . 
  i 'm not crying about something on the internet , you are . 
  in my experience a debate is generally over as soon as nazi accusations are dropped , or the end times are invoked . 
  if someone calls you every name under the sun and accuses you of ` killing our future ' , would you listen to that person ? 
  i 'd suspect some sort of psychological disorder and move on . 
  yes , there are legitimate debates to be had about the german role in european debt crisis ; even i dont fully agree with the position of our government . 
  but it is * my * government , not yours or anyone else 's . 
  if you start calling me a nazi , or accuse me of jeopardzing europe 's future , you might make me angry , but you most certainly will not make me change my position . 
  cry a little , why do n't you ? 
  i see the statesman is working hard not to create a thoughtful atmosphere for the debate about the european debt crisis . 
  i do n't know wheher to laugh or cry about that article . 
  there are a couple of problems with the article , prominent among them his lack of intellectual honesty : * he quotes the eu energy roadmap ( energy roadmap 2050 ( com ( 2011 ) 885 ) ) out of context , therefore distorting its purpose * he completely disregards the potential benefits of a balanced energy mix , citing nuclear fossil fuel as the only sustainable ( read : economically viable ) solution * he is apparently ( though not surprisingly ) a climate change denialist ( see above ), 
  * rabble rabble rabble ... *, 
  dont forget their most famous prime minister and national hero , bruce . 
  i 'm * still * waiting for genetic engineering to catch up . 
  bastards . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjungbklofe&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=217s just . . wtf ? 
  same article , but more detailed : http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10001424052702304203604577398541135969380.html closing sentence of the article :  evidence mounts daily that man-made global warming is a phony apocalypse , but its effect in depressing living standards is all too real . 
  from the author of :  `` roosters of the apocalypse : how the junk science of global warming almost bankrupted the western world '' so , yeah . . 
  so by taking disconnected cases of fraud and misappropriations as evidence , you have convinced yourself that the entire system of the eu is nothing else than a money dispensary . 
  look , i get the point that there are flaws in the design of the union ( democratic deficit , regulatory bias , etc etc. ) . 
  most of them are connected to a lack political commitment and interest and the growth spurt in the past two decades . 
  but to claim that this political endeavour is nothing else but a cabal by a secretive political class , in conjunction with international finance misses the point by more than a mile . 
   they 've been complicit in this as long as the `` union '' has existing . 
  this is unsurprising since , as their actions indicate , one reason for the eu 's existence is to provide monetary reward for loyal party members who have n't made it into their national governments . 
  why on earth would the eu political elite want to investigate themselves ? 
  clearly this was [ their only intention ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_rome ) . 
  are we playing alternate history again ? 
  yeah they 're not made from marble ... gtfo, 
  i did n't see the need to respond to your nonsense . 
  come back when you 've grasped the concept of civilisation .
