  but if he 's [ macedonian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_macedonia ) , how does he get to vote in greece ? 
  nope . 
  he was essentially implying that people on the african continent are uncivilised . 
  not exactly a favorable comment . 
  . . eight year olds , dude . 
  that is actualy a fair bit racist . 
  at least they left africa unscathed this time . 
  i understand your argument full well . 
  you scolded him for complaining about rising champagne prices while others are dying of thirst . 
  but does his income situation invalidate his argument ? 
  does it matter if he is reasonably well off ? 
  you are attacking him for something that is n't even implied in the article . 
  yes , it is reasonable to assume that people who have less disposable income will be more affected in the case of a ` grexit ' and the return to the drachma . 
  but once again , that was not his point . 
  the main thrust of the article is this :  none of these parties have advanced a serious agenda to avoid disaster . 
  those who are deeply in debt -- or who aspire to gain at the expense of others -- hope that the economy 's slate will simply be wiped clean . 
  those who have stashed their money abroad will be able to buy assets on the cheap if greece leaves the euro zone . 
  but the people who work hard and pay taxes , who have a stake in reform and progress , who carry the burden of every mistake , have no credible representative to vote for . 
  those who want a better greece have to look for the least bad option . 
  simply criticizing him for reflecting his immediate circumstances and adressing not adressing the working poor misses the point . 
  his intention is to display the inner conflict , ahead of an election that only offers the choice between crooks and populists . 
  anarchists dont want power . 
  quite the opposite . 
  aside from that , from my own personal experience , anarchists can be the dumbest peopple you can have a conversation with . 
  most of them believe it is incumbent on them to bring about a new ( dis - ) order of society , whether society wants it or not . 
  throw in a little propaganda of the deed , a little proto-marxism , have them come from a middle-class background and you have your typical run of the mill anarchist . 
   the author certainly does n't represent the majority of greeks . 
  ( ... ) the situation is presented from the perspective of a man that lost very few during the crisis , while the middle and lower classes lost much more from the far fewer that they had . 
  while i understand the people who have money in the bank and are scared of losing them , it is the case that today in greece more and more people are left with nothing . 
  i 'm not sure what your point is . 
  your claim seems to be that to understand the plight of the lower class you have to be one of them . 
  that is nonsense in my opinion . 
  alexis tsipras is not of the working class either , yet i assume you would not raise this claim against him , would you ? 
  my point is this : konstandaras raises some very salient points with regard to this election . 
  one might easily cast them aside as ` self-hate ' but that would just be ignoring the multiple failures of civil society and governance that have lead to the present situation , which is exactly what he does . 
  ps :  the author is afraid that his children wo n't be able to go study abroad , while today in greece parents send their children at school unfed . 
  i fail to see what the first part of the argument has to do with the second . 
  the european erasmus scheme applies to greece as well . 
  the ability to send your kids to university has very little to do with school lunches ( children of university age will be able to earn a living for themselves ) . 
  . . aaaand we will count down to grexit if that happens . 
  . . which is why you felt the need to kill the messenger . 
  i get that kathimerini leans more to the conservative side , but what does this have to do with the article ? 
  does his affiliation invalidate his arguments ? 
  do you have a better perspective ? 
  * * pretty sure my latin teacher will want to murder me if he ever reads this . 
  you 're getting more creative . 
  that was surprisingly funny . 
  but in all seriousness , craig doyle * will * have to be eliminated if you want our help . 
   and if bill gates moved to latvia , their gdp would triple ... no . 
  no , it would not . 
  you are thinking about his net worth . 
  what you presumably ( though wrongfully ) meant was the amount of goods and services he produces on a yearly basis , which is considerably less . 
  so why would he vote for a party that he deems unreliable ? 
  -- merely because he thinks that ` their intentions are good ' ? 
  there 's also this :  syriza is a party that had to progress , within weeks , from a fringe political agglomeration struggling to get into parliament ( at around the 4 % mark ) to a major party that may have to form government in a few short weeks . 
  by his own admission they are a rag-tag band of political idealists with no experience in government , yet their people are the only ones that will be able to negotiate , because they * just magically know * what 's wrong with greece ? 
  that makes absolutely no sense . 
  please do n't do that . 
  that 's willfully ignoring the flipside of that argument . 
  these problems were known before the euro was introduced . 
  so unless you are saying that the south was ruled by dunces at that time , it would also be immature to accept responsibility for - in your parlance - `` doing things wrong '' . 
  frequent poster to / r/whiterights ( do n't go ) . 
  he is either a troll or an unbelievable fuckwit . 
  there are virtually no groups in germany who are asking for retribution . 
  the sudetendeutschen/bdv represent a narrow political fringe in german politics who have n't been able in the past and most likely wont be able in the future to pursue their agenda . 
  i am fully aware that international law and international relations are n't always clear cut , so i can only express my own personal attitude in this matter . 
  in this case , there is very little to be gained by digging up the past , so i feel the above mentioned [ declaration ] ( http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/czech-german_declaration ) provides an appropriate starting point to future developments :  ( ... ) each side remains committed to its legal system and respects the fact that the other side has a different legal position . 
  both sides therefore declare that they will not burden their relations with political and legal issues which stem from the past . 
  in that spirit , i think that an official declaration from both sides , declaring an apology on both sides and promising to draw down legal instruments would be the right way to go . 
  additionally , in the context of european integration and existing projects like euregio ( egrensis/labe ) an agreement on this matter could be a further step ahead . 
  so , why do the boy scouts hate america again ? 
  firstly , from a layman 's understanding , the icc handles only cases in which the state is unwilling or unable to act himself . 
  it does not look to me as if the czech republic is stalling any * legal review * in this matter . 
  furthermore , since the individuals responsible have long since passed , there is no one to prosecute , hence there is no case to be had . 
  thirdly , since most of the actions have been covered by the bene\u0161 - decrees , the nullification thereof should not change the legal situation , since no one can legally be charged ex post facto . 
  rgardless of these points , do n't you think that such an attitude as you pointed out above - the fear of persecution - points to a tacit admission of guilt ? 
  and do n't you think that this is worse than to approach this situation in a straight - forward manner ? 
  especially since the matter has already de facto been settled in the form of a treaty . 
  the military ? 
  [ retiring old flags ] ( http://www.americanflags.org/docs/etiquette.jsp?pageid=0690200091781119362389761 ) is a thing apparently . 
  i can do the sword . 
  the rest : not so much . 
  with abominations [ such ] ( http://www.occupationgifts.com/media/0854-american-flags-tie.jpg ) [ as ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_yctor7uqa4/tgfdq9x8wsi/aaaaaaaal1e/dlcnaty-2wi/s1600/american%2bflag%2bshirt-not%2bus.jpg ) [ these ] ( http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/images/dioguardi-flag-shirt.jpg ) , i 'd start questioning the sanity of my fellow flag waving countrymen as well . 
   so if czech republic cancels benes-dekretes , sudetengerman get back czech cititezenship and may restitution a properties.and who will pay a war reparation?it would be a mess that viewpoint is largely incorrect . 
  the prospects of legal claims against the czech republic have severly diminished since the [ german-czech declaration ] ( http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/czech-german_declaration ) of 1997 . any repeal of the bene\u0161 - decrees would therefore be largely symbolic .

  i 'd like to see further integration in economic policy ( trade , anti-trust and banking ) , science and development policies and foreign and defence policies as well . 
  i believe that the community will be able to handle these areas more efficiently .
