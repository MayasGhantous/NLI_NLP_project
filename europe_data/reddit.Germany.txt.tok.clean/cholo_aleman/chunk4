  labour and welfare policies i would still like to be handled on the national level ( at least for the moment ) . 
  environmental protection would be best handled as a shared responsibility , with guidlines set at the federal level and details handled locally . 
  in fact , looking at this sketch right now , i 'd say we could learn a lot from the examples of the us and switzerland , in terms of federalism and governing in a diverse community . 
  so no changes at all ? 
  you do know how this ended , right ? 
  dude , tourettes is nothing to be laughed at . 
  because the desired political control is not yet in place , i assume . 
   extremely important message  leading american thinker neither of which is true . 
  parts of it sounded like danish to me , phonetically speaking . 
  manufactured controversy seems to be a legitimate line in contemporary journalism . 
  ` people of the olive belt ' maybe ? 
   i think we are seeing a clear case of double standards . 
  countries that fucked up are treated more `` fairly '' just because they are more `` north european and aryan '' . 
  i start suspecting you are full of crap . 
   `` it 's not the winning that matters , it 's the taking part ''  `` es ist nicht der sieg , der z\u00e4hlt , es beteiligt ist '' what you meant to say is : `` dabeisein ist alles . '', 
  just for the sake of the argument : what do you have against the british ? 
  then why tie it to merkel ? 
  the article referred to a speech she gave at a [ conference ] ( http://www.angela-merkel.de/page/102_757.htm ) * this weekend , yet there were no reports of her threatening greece . 
  i do n't like agitation , that 's all . 
  * could n't find another link , sry . 
  they seem to be the only site reporting this , which leads me to suspect that this is a mistranslation of a report of merkel saying that  [ it should be possible for countries that violate fiscal rules to be sued in the european court of justice ] ( http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/bre8510cb/us-eurozone-germany-merkel ) . 
  [ source in german ] ( http://de.reuters.com/article/topnews/iddebee85201g20120603 ) ) so , yeah . 
  keep stirring that pot . 
  and zombies . 
  never discount zombies . 
  they have kazakhstan 's [ national anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=zla65o1nok8#t=68s ) all wrong . 
  why yes , yes i am adorable . 
   tsipras said nothing about how he would enforce his promises as prime minister against the dictates of the eu and european governments . 
  his strategy is based on threatening the eu with a possible greek state bankruptcy to obtain concessions . 
  and yet , he constantly stresses that syriza accepts the eu and will do everything to stay in the euro zone . 
  in a time when post-greece scenarios for the ez are already being discussed , this gambit may well lead to disaster . 
  i appreciate their recognition of the need for public sector reform , but the methods proposed are wrongheaded and will not lead out of this crisis . 
   under these conditions , the demands raised by syriza can only be implemented by mobilizing the european working class against the eu institutions on the basis of a socialist perspective . 
  socialists are adorable , are n't they ? 
  lets start with his/her style : like any other pamphlet , he follows a very simplistic theory of history , where each event can be explained by one variable . 
  greek history essentially presented as an epic battle between forces of good and evil , with the puppet masters usually residing outside greece . 
  gems : * the us-backed junta leaded the country during the global oil and financial crisis of the early 70s . 
  * he implemented a plan of destroying the economy through various measures , with the most prominent being the enlargement of the public sector . 
  * papandreou destroyed the economy , despite being an economics phd , which can only mean one thing : he knew full well what he did - ignorance is not an option . 
  badly written , badly argued . 
  you 're right - insecurity is not sexy . 
  she was born in 1926 . i doubt she looked like this when she was five , nor do i think she wore the crown at that age . 
  on top of that , i dont think new zealanders were clairvoyant and foresaw the date of the coronation in 1931 . 
  well , it * is * campaign season . 
  so whenever an extreme opinion is uttered , expect either outrage from the republican side , or an even more extreme opinion . 
  or possibly both . 
  even if it may not be statistically relevant , i like the uk . 
  you guys serve as a much needed reality check - sometimes annoyingly so - to our european experiment . 
  i actually liked cameron when he first appeared on the scene . 
  i read his webcameron - blog from time to time . 
  he appeared less stolid than previous conservative leaders and seemed to have a more ` workable ' attitude to europe . 
  having said that , i do n't agree with most of the policies of his government , so my sympathy ends there . 
  ps : i find it more fascinating that the czechs dislike greece even more than the germans ( 25 % to 27 % ) . 
  i wonder why that may be . 
  any czechs in the audience ? 
  could be the third or fourth time this has been posted here . 
  entirely different topic . 
  yet this happens far too often , which makes me wonder if americans understand postwar germany at all . 
  to be brief : having experienced nationalist mass hysteria and industrialised genocide , only to be completely wiped out in a war that was unparalleled in history , germans have had something of an epiphany with regard to the concept of nation and political morality . 
  advancing european integration is seen as an exercise furthering german interest , while at the same time sharing the economic benefits . 
   you missed my point by 1609 metres . 
  does n't have the same ring to it . 
   partly it 's a political problem with so many different countries we end up with a kind of inertia . 
  so we just have to bend over and take it , right ? 
  you will have to convince german voters that it would be necessary or even worth it to throw more good money after bad . 
  judging from the public opinion in germany [ right now ] ( http://politbarometer.zdf.de/zdf/zdfportal/web/zdf.de/politbarometer/2942200/22742734/1197b7/deutsche-klar-gegen-eurobonds.html ) , you will have a hard time doing that . 
  furthermore , i do not see a moral imperative for a further involvement in this financial desaster , as much as there is an economic incentive to stabilize the ez for the sake of its healthier , more committed members . 
   you do n't understand several things . 
  please stop presuming things you know nothing about . 
   a greek former defence minister , with german links , is now in prison . 
  officials at siemens and [ ferrostaal ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/world/europe/akis-tsochatzopouloss-corruption-case-hits-hard-in-greece.html ) have been punished as well . 
  your point ? 
   but what matters in the end is this : money were added to greece 's debt , ca n't take them back . 
  elected officials are acting on behalf of the citizenry , whether they like it or not . 
  the ` german village ' should not be held responsible for the ` greek pensioner ' and vice versa . 
   ( ... ) and you think you 're funding a reckless greek lifestyle . 
  you are again falsely presuming what i 'm thinking . 
  ` we ' did not fund reckless lifestyle , as much as a dysfunctional governance apparatus that was apparently unaware of - or unwilling to face - budgeting constraints or economic foresight for decades . 
  the european lenders , which you would so like to blame for greece 's woes , were never tasked with protecting the budget of the hellenic republic . 
  furthermore , pointing out that a large part of the bailout circles back to the lender countries explains little , unless you consider the [ context ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/business/global/athens-no-longer-sees-most-of-its-bailout-aid.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ) :  since may 2010 , greece has been sent about $ 177 billion in european taxpayer money to keep the country afloat and ward off a bigger crisis that might threaten the entire currency union . 
  of that amount , a full two-thirds has gone to pay off bondholders and the troika . 
  only a third has been earmarked to finance government operations , with only a tiny sliver spent on stimulus projects for the anemic economy . 
  this circular lending is all about risk management . 
  ( ... ) the troika wants to ensure the same does not happen to its members and the taxpayers . 
  ( ... ) the european authorities have a strong interest in avoiding the even higher costs that would result if greece left the euro zone or defaulted completely on its debt . 
  this is not foreign aid , it never was . 
  this is risk containment . 
  i am not scorning the greek people for wanting to live comfortably . 
  i am angry that things were left to fester in plain sight for so long . 
  so let me get this straight - you detest the fact that germany somehow found itself the political and economic leader in the eu , but at the same time you argue for more german compassion with the european south ? 
   greece 's military expenditure was 60 billion euros . 
  . . which is in turn the turks fault , of course . 
  greeks have no agency in their defence policy . 
  never have , never will . 
  you sources are indeed interesting : [ broke ? 
  buy a few warships , france tells greece  ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/23/us-eurozone-greece-warships-analysis-idustre62m1q520100323 )  asked whether big european suppliers were using the crisis to press arms sales on athens , he said : `` this has always been the case with these countries . 
  it is not because of the crisis , there is no link . '', 
  [ siemens , greece settle decade-long bribery scandal  ( http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/siemens-greece-settle-decadelong-bribery-scandal-20120309-1uo23.html )  [ thyssenkrupp marine systems last year canceled a greek order for four other submarines over the dispute , in which it said athens ' arrears exceeded 520 million euros . 
  ] ( http://af.reuters.com/article/idafll3420920090921 ) ( ... )  a greek parliamentary committee has determined that inflated contract prices cost the country more than two billion euros during the 1990s . 
  part of that money is believed to have ended up in the pockets of some senior greek officials who helped broker the contracts .
