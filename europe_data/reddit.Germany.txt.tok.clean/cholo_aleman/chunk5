  ( ... ) two former pasok officials - a former party strategist and aide to ex-pm costas simitis and a former minister - have admitted taking money from siemens over a decade ago . 
  yup . 
  everything happened without greek involvement . 
  those dastardly foreign agitators !, 
  as i 've said before , shifting the blame by denying that greek officials were alwys implicated in these cases of corruption , misappropriation and bad governance is n't going to earn you any trust . 
   i 'd suggest to drop the blinders , they 're making it difficult to stare facts in the eye . 
  indeed . 
   but i do believe time is the essential factor in measuring how hard a population works . 
  well , no . 
  you are still using the statistical evidence stating that on an aggregate level , greek workers spent more time at work ( working hours , if you like ) than workers in , say , germany . 
  the data says nothing about the effort the individual worker put into his labor . 
  unless you define what the difference is between ` hard ' and ` not-so-hard ' labor * we are running in circles . 
  is it difficulty ? 
  is it efficiency ? 
  as it stands this figure is nothing more than a feel-good statistic for those who want to show who is the best european , and i dont want to play that game . 
  * ^ work ^ is ^ a ^ confusing ^ term ^ when ^ you ^ talk ^ about ^ these ^ matters . 
  ^ i ^ know ^ hard ^ labor ^ has ^ a ^ very ^ different ^ meaning , ^ but ^ since ^ we ^ are ^ talking ^ about ^ economics , ^ it ^ is ^ a ^ better ^ fit . 
   what does that even mean , hard ? 
  your words , not mine . 
  as evidenced here :  why is everyone so unwilling to accept that greeks do in fact work * harder * than germans . 
  so the onus is on you to define what signifies ` hard ' work . 
  as far economic indicators go , there is no hard/less hard work . 
  keep shifting the blame on others . 
  without europe , greece would surely be fine . 
  more hours worked \u2260 working harder . 
  they may spend more time at their workplace , but what they are doing there is another thing . 
  this has nothing to do with someone 's pride , or prejudices that redditors may have . 
  work/labor by definition is a measure of the effort used in creation of goods and services and , as it has been established time and time again , the figure of `` hours worked '' on its own is meaningless . 
  i think you would agree that labor is not and end in itself . 
  suppose you manage to produce the same amount of in goods or services in 15 hours that someone else manages to do in 8 . let 's also suppose that you are paid an equivalent sum for the goods or services that you have produced . 
  would n't you feel cheated if you had to stay 7 hours longer than the other guy just to make the same money ? 
  this is n't working harder , [ this is working more stupidly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_hour_worked ) . 
  but i get what you 're saying : it 's the bosses fault . 
  he choses to squander the factors of production available to him and to have a smaller output . 
  his main goal is to make a product that requires more labor and resources . 
  [ oda krell ] ( http://de.reddit.com/user/oda_krell ) \u2260 [ cholo aleman ] ( http://de.reddit.com/user/cholo_aleman ) . 
  as for the rest of your comment : you have n't made much of an effort to clarify how the concepts he lays out are related to any actual political , social or economic events . 
  his political commentary is the bloodless regurgitation of state monopoly capitalism and mass manipulation which we have heard from him time and again . 
  the evidence provided ( if any ) is about as reliable as north korean television . 
  the problem is that most of what he argues does not deal with reality , i.e. 
  the sphere that most of us inhabit . 
  arguing against chomsky is more or less meaningless because most of his points are caricatures of real events or meaningless generalities ^ ( cf. 
  your summary above ) . 
  he does not provide context to his accusations . 
  arguing against him would be like arguing against the brothers grimm - a fruitless exercise . 
  coming from a political science perspective , i 'd recommend : the lisbon treaty : a legal and political analysis / jean-claude piris and the political system of the european union / simon hix and bj\u00f8rn h\u00f8yland and policy-making in the european union / ed . 
  by helen wallace , mark a. pollack might be a good place to start . 
  but it really depends on the specific topics of the course , of which we know very little about . 
  i just want to thank the gema for protecting me from accessing this undoubtedly gross copyright violation . 
  [ thank you gema ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgr3cbum8zw ) . 
  most of what i have seen from that show seemed contrived to me . 
  they are trying to be funny , but they dont have the satirical edge of the daily show . 
  i just find them a bit bland . 
  if you want to see satirical ( german ) news done right , watch [ extra 3 ] ( http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0cg4qfjac&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ndr.de%2ffernsehen%2fsendungen%2fextra_3%2findex.html&amp;ei=vh6_t-aeethssgbd5rw_cg&amp;usg=afqjcnhkris2jm8jsp1qlz5f0btdabpzva&amp;sig2=o-twimsvfxw4lgo4oyx_sg ) , which is in my opinion the better program in every way . 
  nothing in that article said anything about  germany ( . . ) trying to crash the greek economy on purpose in order to centralize power in germany . 
  instead , [ trichet ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/eurozone-trichet-idusl1e8gi0kp20120518 ) suggested :  giving european politicians the power to declare a sovereign state bankrupt and take over its fiscal policy [ and ] to activate the eu federal powers only in exceptional circumstances when a country 's budgetary policies threaten the broader monetary union ( ... ) . 
  all of these elements are more or less part of the [ stability and growth pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stability_and_growth_pact ) , of which greece is already a member . 
  there is no mention of a german takeover , unless you count [ this ] ( http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/05/ex-ecb-head-proposes-giving-greece-the-benton-harbor-michigan-treatment.html ) conjecture as proper news source . 
   germany is trying to crash the greek economy on purpose in order to centralize power in germany . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  sadly , yes . 
   but the truth is our economy went from bad to worse since the euro , it was much healthier before [ bullcrap ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/greece/gdp_per_capita_\\ ( ppp \\ ) . html ) . 
  your obsession with [ female dogs ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/pregnant_female_dog_bitch_mongrel_jan_2008_shot_in_jalandhar_punjab_india_by_gopal1035_017.jpg ) is distracting . 
  the only similarity that i can see is that the dawes-plan served the same end as the current bailout plan . 
  my point still stands , however , that german debt after ww i was n't incurred by government spending . 
  they were imposed by the victors as punishment ( uk , france ) and as a payment guarantee ( us ) . 
  another difference is that unlike greece today , the plan also imposed tariffs , taxes and shares in german enterprises to make good on the reparation payments . 
  i still dont think that this comparison is apt ( or useful ) . 
  wikipedia would call you sockpuppet , not sure about reddit though . 
  meh , i found it quite amusing , seeing him blow his top . 
   you put all greeks in the same category with greeks that were thieves . 
  assuming you are talking about past greek governments , these thieves were employed by the greek citizenry . 
   most northern europeans ive seen on reddit attempt to discuss what is happening in greece are usually complete racists/ignorant fools painted yourself in a corner there , sparky . 
   i was reffering as to how some people see us and how wrong that perception is . 
  that point is unimportant , since no one seriously suggests that this was the cause for the current crisis . 
  you can not bring up this point and then go on to ignore the elephant in the room . 
  someone benefits from these practises and these people are still in your midst - you may well know some of them personally . 
  whether it is the small bribe-taking doctor , the town mayor or even the prime minister . 
  greece has to be willing to accept responsibility for that as well . 
  as long as the public sector is inefficient and unproductive , how else are you going to respond to calls for austerity ? 
  the point is : you have a right to be angry , but be angry at your fellow countrymen first . 
  you are unlikely to change the attitude of the average german , but you can reach out to your neighbour , your family , your friends . 
  true . 
  the eu has been viewed rather negatively in the past few years in sv , dk , even in de . 
  eurobarometer suggests that there is n't much enthusiasm , and the public opinion has certainly dropped in the past five years : http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/cf/showchart_column.cfm?keyid=2202&amp;nationid=2,16,3,14,&amp;startdate=2007.05&amp;enddate=2011.05 i 'd say that most citizens largely ignore high politics and the high-minded rhetoric of euro-politics as long as it doesnt affect them personally . 
  i 'd say that the acceptance of the eu - at least as far as the elites are concerned - is very high . 
  germany has been driving for an integrated europe for a very long time , not least due to the fact that they wanted to redeem themselves and had to integrate themselves into western europe for strategic reasons ( political and economic ) . 
  edit : typo, 
  they did not , however , spend themselves into oblivion . 
  they lost a war and were forced to pay reparations to the victors . 
  so much so that the victors took control of [ parts of germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupation_of_the_rhineland ) . 
  that is n't exactly the same , is it now ? 
  personal attacks are always nice , are n't they ? 
  keep building that strawman - the myth that greeks on the whole are lazy and mindless has been dispelled . 
  however decades of [ failed governance ] ( http://www.oecd.org/document/57/0,3746,en_33873108_33873421_49262649_1_1_1_1,00.html ) and [ systemic ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/oct/26/corruption-index-2010-transparency-international ) [ corruption ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/european-debt-crisis-greek-corruption-booming-says-transparency-international-a-681184.html ) are undeniably also part of the picture and the reason as to why state spending skyrocketed . 
  tackling these issues in earnest is no one else 's duty but the greeks ' . 
  better version : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owgzdynpaso, 
  by that you mean ireland , right ? 
  battle * imperial * , in that case . 
  apropos of the subject , the notion that nazis were secretly ` socialists ' has been bandied about by the american right for a few years .
