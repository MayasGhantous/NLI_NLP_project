  i think this [ piece of golden comedy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_fascism ) played an important part in popularizing this notion . 
  edit : for a truly remarkable analysis of fascism , before it really became a thing in germany , read `` europa und der fascismus '' by hermann heller , in which he outlines the basic tenets of italian fascism . 
  he was almost prophetic in predicting what was about to happen in germany . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  the money generated by shadow economies is still being stored/transferred by banks , especially in bigger fraud cases . 
  money in general finds its way back to the banks anyway . 
  the only ones being cheated are the citizens and the state . 
  are you in the north or in the south ? 
  in your estimation , how much of an influence is the mafia in the shadow economy ? 
  i read somewhere that it made up ~ 25 % of gdp a few years back . 
  alternatively a battle royale perhaps ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  how could you not love this [ woman ] ( http://www.ceausescu.org/images/ceausescu_elena04.jpg ) ? 
  cured ham ? 
   in case you ca n't read well , i said the bailouts did n't go to greek banks , they went to banks that held greek debt . 
  [ there you go ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500395_162-57439836/greek-banks-to-get-$23b-from-bailout-fund/?tag=reddit ) . 
  and in the interest of discussion , i 'd suggest you be less of a dick around here . 
  it is !, 
  i was there last fall and all i can say is that nicolae apparently * really * needed to compensate for something if you know what i mean . . 
   germany is benefitting from the european union . 
  ( ... ) germany is the one that is getting the free ride here . 
  you 're still missing the point . 
  to quote one greek : [ `` the cornerstone of european politics is democracy , not austerity . 
  '' ] ( http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15969019,00.html ) you make it sound as if there is some undisputed guideline whereby german voters have to be thankful to have a job which is in turn secured by exports to the south . 
  which is both ridiculous and insulting . 
  the decision is is theirs to make . 
  edit : accidentally a word . 
  then why not let vatican city run the show ? 
  look , they 're centrally located , they have nice representative architecture and the pope runs everything else anyway . 
  i think the current crisis would not benefit from more integration , necessarily . 
  rather i think that * serious * integration is necessary . 
  by that i mean we should reassess what we want out of europe , figure out how to make it run and commit to it . 
  i realize that this concept is rather simplistic , but beginning in the early 1990 's up to this point european leaders have done very little to adress the practicality of europe . 
  instead we have seen , intiative after initiative , how they tried to prove the * inevitability * of europe . 
  . . dont forget the balkans and greece . 
  why would that be ? 
  their primary job is to uphold the common market and to ensure that no member state disrupts it by legislation which goes against the common guidelines . 
  besides that , the way they went about it was n't all that smart : submitting the request - which had been rejected before - with the exact same arguments is n't all that smart . 
  i do n't think the man who also built [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_parliament ) had cost efficiency in his mind . 
  and as always with the femen , the majority of the viewership will think : ` tits ! ', 
  and move on . 
  no message conveyed . 
  i agree that the goal should not be to starve the debtors to death . 
  no matter what happens , we will still be on the same continent , so the threat of political instability or even civil war affects us all . 
  on the other hand , there is no alternative to budget consolidation and - more importantly imo - an overhaul of ineffective governance . 
   it either federalizes ( at least economically ) and we all win , or it dies as it has been dying for the last 2-3years . 
  even in the event of that happening , i fear that there will still be decades of transfers from north to south . 
  the hardest part in this process of integration is to get to an agreement that doesnt make the north feel cheated . 
  all right , all right !, 
  i get the point !, 
   `` fahrendes gesindel/volk '' a slur against the sinti people , if i remember correctly . 
  vagrant would be the corresponding term in english . 
  let 's just say that the norwegians are in a state of transition . 
  can someone explain the split between bohemia/moravia/prague and the rest of the czech republic ? 
  i realize that it may just be a small difference ( 29.9 % to 30 % ) but it still looks odd to me . 
  sorry , no . 
  i took your comment to mean that uk politicians were somehow more trustworthy than european politicians , which is , was and always will be bullshit . 
  fairly certain [ that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_united_kingdom_cash_for_access_scandal ) 's [ bullshit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal ) . 
  by that analogy dentists simply make mountains of money by looking into peoples mouths . 
  then you 're lucky this was n't mind-blowing . 
  . . something something * violence inherent in the system !, 
   blockupy really ? 
  it has been pointed out earlier , the euro is n't governed by the ep and the commission . 
  he simply rose to be an insufferable , self-opinionated ass to everyone concerned . 
  shame on them for being insufferable arses and hypocrites . 
  yes , ukip is actually a very populist party , trying to connect to the voters basest [ instincts ] ( http://www.ukip.org/media/pdf/ukiplocalmanifesto2012.pdf ) ( do you like your local pub ? 
  we do too ! ) . 
  what irks me about them is n't necessarily their closed mindedness , it is their attitude . 
  they are somewhat like the asshole at the back of the classroom who snarks at the lecture , yet does n't have original thoughts or anything constructive to say . 
  so , what you 're trying to say is that you 're * human * . 
  interesting . 
  ` performed ' by players bought from all over the world . 
  what a pompous ass . 
  ukip is not - and has never been - interested in a solution to european problems . 
  i have a hard time understanding what he is trying to accomplish in the ep . 
  i 'd start with their very questionable definition of property and wealth creation . 
  you can not in good faith want people to earn a living and at the same time claim that  `` the savings and pension entitlements of the broad mass of the population must be secured , while the interest and repayment entitlements of the wealthy , the banks , the hedge funds and the corporations must be cancelled . '', 
  that , and the same tiring usage of the word neo-liberal . 
  they are well-meaning , but the means to their end are dubious . 
  [ respawn ] ( http://de.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/toeru/i_am_the_new/ ) !, 
  that still does not make a coherent argument , sorry . 
  you either want to talk about the relationship between productivity and commodities in the european context or you talk about intergovernmental negotiations in the current euro crisis . 
  so far , there is nothing to discuss because you have n't established any causalities . 
  i fail to see how shitty governance and probellems of corruption are connected to the world wide energy markets . 
  it seems to me that you simply threw two topics together to see if they stick . 
  you have not defined a common framework by which you can compare the governance issues you are trying to adress ( such as quality of service in the public sector ) . 
  you have also not shown how ` peak oil ' has become an ` enemy ' of small states and big states alike . 
  i am not trying to be naive here - i am simply trying to grasp your argument . 
  this could be taken to say that states are ill prepared ( maybe even ill equipped to deal with ? ), 
  for the foreseeable rise of energy prices ? 
  then why did you throw in germany and greece ? 
  how do they exemplify your case ? 
   polls show the leftist syriza party , which rejects the bailout and placed second in last week 's vote , is now on course to win , a result that would give it an automatic bonus of 50 seats in the 300-seat parliament . 
  there goes the * sensible * part . . 
  greek conundrum on the euro : damned if you do , damned if you dont . 
  uk not part of the euro . 
   we are now exposed to each other 's arguments , and it remains to be seen what the outcome will be . 
  for now , every single indication says that the extreme austerity program failed . 
  show me again where i have taken up a position either in favour of or against the austerity programme ? 
  i did n't .
