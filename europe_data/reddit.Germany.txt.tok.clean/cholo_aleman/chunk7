  they 're not obligated to do anything , and they 're not hypocrites . 
  it 's something else : many of them are misinformed , and papadimos ' cabinet is largely the one to blame . 
  not the greek nation . 
  ps : discussions usually work in the scheme of point/counterpoint . 
  so far we have not had a discussion . 
  i thought greeks invented the concept of logic . 
  so why not use it ? 
  they are useful in the sense that they show who are the biggest per capita lenders . 
  however , the implied gloating in the conclusion is entirely misplaced . 
  none of the information you have posted confirms your original point/strawman :  ( ... ) the average german thinks that he/she pays the most and to suggest that there is either a special ( historical/moral ) obligation or a hypocrisy of germany with regards to greece is just outrageous bullshit . 
  both cases are in no way connected . 
  frankly , i find this kind of mudslinging offensive . 
  ha - i missed that !, 
  nice !, 
  ( i was referring to [ nigerian scam ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advance-fee_fraud#nigerian_prince ) mers . . ), 
  i 'm somewhat sceptical about this website , so i 'm going to link to the german report which seems to have been the [ source ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article106297660/schaeuble-ist-bereit-fuer-den-euro-chefposten.html ) . 
  are you a ~ ~ nigerian ~ ~ greek prince , who has recently made a large inheritance ? 
  new swears are * engineered * , crafted even . 
  you 've repeated thrice that you think the report is wrong , yet you have not presented evidence as to why the report is inaccurate . 
  i wonder who we are supposed to believe now ? 
  i presume he needed something to convince himself that the german loan is n't * that * important , since - you know - the fact that they 're picking up 27 % of the bill doesnt count . 
  no one ever claimed that they were alone . 
  i 'm still not sure why it is relevant to the matter to point out the per capita amount - is he trying to belittle the german contribution ? 
  what a petty and childish thing to do . 
  well , yeah . 
  i 'm naked right now !, 
  -- yiannis bournos ( 15 ) , syriza 's european policy spokesman, 
  . . according to a poll that was taken 3 years ago . 
  that is a hard question to answer . 
  in my personal opinion , i think that there are two general points : one - the demise of the fdp does not correlate with classical liberalism becoming obsolete / being surpassed by other ` movements ' . 
  what is happening to the fdp is a story of insanely bad internal management decisions , irrational policy decisions and bad press/pr in general ( i 'm saying this as a former member of that party , and i 'm starting to get angry when i think about it ) . 
  at a more general level , i feel that this has also to do with a lack of visible intellectuals in the party , as well as a general lack of interest to engage the issues of the day in public policy discourse . 
  two - concerning classical liberalism in the german society / in german politics : it has definitely taken a few hits during the economic crisis and parties like the cdu and fdp are partly to blame for that , because they have not been able ( at least in my opinion ) to differentiate between the market-centric approach of liberalism ( classical liberalism is often lumped together with neo-liberalism ) and what i would call civic liberalism , i.e. 
  the notion that individual freedom and self-determination are at least co-equal to economic freedom . 
  it is very hard to give more than just a cursory overview on this topic , given my time constraints . 
  and i make no claim that my explanation is complete , but i want to reiterate my basic point : classical liberalism is far from dead in the german political discourse . 
  at this point , it just smells funny . 
  well , they are currently polling in the 3-4 % range , which means that come election day they may not be represented in the bundestag . 
  and coalitions are usually formed by parties that are actually represented in the parliament , 
   no legal way to exit the eurozone if greece so wishes . 
  so a unanimous amendmend ratified by all national parliaments would be needed for this to happen you 're right . 
  all member states would have to vote in favour of kicking them out . 
  hardly an easy vote . 
  what is frustrating to me is that it seems the prospective greek government wants to have their cake and eat it too . 
  i completely understand how desparate their situation is and that hardship will be unavoidable either way . 
  yet there seems to be very little in the way of willingness to adapt to the situation . 
  tricky . 
  they are polling at ~ [ 10 % ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm ) atm , so hypothetically speaking they 'd make an impact . 
  from what i have seen and read about them so far ( on the local level , mind you ) , their positions are mostly in the center-left spectrum . 
  my best guess is that they 'd end up voting alongside the greens and spd ( and possibly the linke ( far left ) ) . 
  it is of course too early to tell if they will become part of any coalition government at this point . 
  better not . 
  i dont have any money either , 
  sorry i skipped that  grand coalition refers to coalitions between the two biggest parties , cdu and spd - centre - right and centre - left . 
  this has occured twice on the federal level , 1966-1969 and 2005-2009 . both times marriages of convenience , i might add . 
  no no no . 
  dont just shoot the messenger . 
  elaborate what is wrong about his points . 
  throwing around buzzwords helps no one . 
  no term limit for the german chancellorship ; it 's too early to tell how the elections next year will turn out - i 'd say 50:50 . it is however very likely that the fdp will not be in the next government . 
  if there is going to be either a grand coalition or a spd/greens coalition , the german attitude towards the eu will change and it will robably be more in tune with the newly elected french government . 
  considering the current situation , i think a fundraising party would be more appropriate . 
  cyprus is not my fight . 
  and i believe my reasoning was fairly clear . 
  i have an even better conspiracy for you : it 's . . ... the * germans * !, 
  think about it : the borders have to be secured with mines , and tanks and other fancy equipment that goes bang - to keep out those dirty , heathen hordes . 
  you will have to find a supplier . 
  and who is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in europe ? 
  germany , of course !, 
  it was all just a cunning plan by those dastardly teutons , to enslave the greeks even longer !, 
  i was hinting to the fact that if you could channel your energy into something more productive than spewing bile on the internet , we would * all * be better off . 
  i believe the expression is ` cutting off your nose to spite your face ' . 
  but whatever works , right ? 
  well , there 's still the state seizure of property , the abandonment of democratic government and the regulation of public speech favored by hardline communists , but let 's not fuss about those details . 
  you may be the single biggest argument for more employment in greece , you know that ? 
  yes , the ` left ' uniting is [ always a good thing ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/sed_logo.svg/220px-sed_logo.svg.png ) - what could go wrong ? 
  i 'd like to find out as well . 
  i only got as far as it being a childish representation of protest against a perceived elite establishment . 
  all comedy relies on distortion of reality . 
  what 's your point ? 
  that he was n't historically accurate ? 
  well he * is * greek . 
  so he could have just referred to you as an [ \u1f30\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idiot#etymology ) , or `` private citizen '' . 
  either that , or he is a juvenile moron . 
  the only thing thats hilarious is you deludedly describing people as `` north-west european vultures of reddit '' . . 
   . . hollande lives up to his ideals and stops germany 's shit . . care to elaborate ? 
  so why the question marks ? 
  you are n't just ` quoting ' if you add questionmarks . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  judging from the track record of nationalist governments , i 'd say ineffective foreign policy is one of the main features of this ideology . 
  . . as opposed to extreme right propaganda . 
  they make sure that it 's easy to understand just * who * they hate the most . 
  the extreme right/nationalists usually offer solutions to immigration that are . . somewhat impractical . 
  not to mention that alienating your neigbours through nationalist slogans seems to be the wrong step if you have problems with border security . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  germany and greece were not ready for the same euro , if anything . 
  yes , but we keep them locked away and generally pay little attention to them . 
  . . this is you id finishing you comment : `` what a fucking nutter ! '', 
  you have either just arrived through time travel from 1989 , or you and i have both visited very different east germanies . 
  either that or he didnt get the memo about the costume party . . ( joke , obv . ),
