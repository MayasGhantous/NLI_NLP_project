  for real ? 
  hup holland hup, 
  rebuild it, 
  lovely !, 
  would grab a beer , sit outside and just chill . 
  can only speak for myself when i say the whole brexit thing bores me to death already . 
  i mean every country is free to make their own decisions whats best for them . 
  some even take it personally . 
  for me it 's none of my business . 
  i like the british the same as before . 
  not love , but like , 
  hate is a strong word , i would call it rivalry . 
  why would i hate someone just because he is from a certain country . 
  never made sense to me . 
  alright erdolf , alright, 
  the picture above is the market hall in budapest, 
  got it . 
  i do n't really think its a american/british thing . 
  we call it pommes , which comes from french . 
  yum, 
  you call it chips in the netherlands ? 
  we call [ that ] ( http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/istock_000012710166_small.jpg ) chips, 
  in germany its just a `` scheibe brot '' . 
  i do n't think there is anything like a sandwich in our famous `` cuisine '' . 
  top 3 are holland , england , austria, 
  quite impressed . 
  how is the mood of the `` normal '' population in ireland ? 
  do you feel steady improvements on irelands economy ? 
  no thanks , i prefer surstr\u00f6mming . 
   unless you 're really into beer and sausage . 
  aka * german *, 
  ever wondered why there is something like `` racial profiling '' ? 
  it does n't come from nowhere . 
  it 's only about the electric mini though . 
  they did n't say anything about closing down the oxford site ? 
  more a question of do we invest more and expand the oxford site or produce elsewhere . 
  as far as i know , the oxford site is already on their max in terms of production capacity , that 's why every 3rd mini is produced in the netherlands already . 
  how about you just keep your wiener out of our schnitzel habits pesky austrians . 
  true , even though it has nothing to do with german , but a lot gets lost with dubbing in general . 
  that 's why i watch most movies and tv series in english . 
  amazon prime is just great for that . 
  is that a fleischwurst ? 
  thanks mr. obvious, 
  oh god ... i 'm full ... but ... 
  indeed silly . 
  i read this in `` die welt '' today . 
  beer culture and great food like fish and chips , blood sausage , english breakfast etc. 
  i would definitely survive over there . 
  i know it was on german tv , but i cant remember the name . 
  ] ( https://www.hoerspiel.de/macsservice/macs/contentservice/120/5156322.jpeg ), 
  yup , with his comrade hein bl\u00f6d , 
  so ... whats the difference between this and a brothel ? 
  pretty sure you can get a coffee there too . 
  ** yuuuuge **, 
  its the trade surplus with the whole world , not only with european countries . 
  well more bad news coming your way nigel , i got flatulences . 
  rotterdam is fascinating and is to you what is frankfurt to us basically ? 
  we would not have a skyline like frankfurt today , if it was n't bombed so heavily in ww2 . 
  it 's one of my favourite national anthems ( after ours of course ) . 
  source youtube , filter most clicked, 
  makes me want to watch some rugby now . 
  in which european countries is rugby popular ? 
  its interesting . 
  im getting bored of football lately . 
  was in crete , greece last year . 
  loved it , just do n't eat where all the tourists are . 
  well , that rule counts for probably most countries . 
  that 's mainly because of the port of rotterdam . 
  ... for some reason germany got one english and one german sub . 
  / r/germany and / r/de, 
  australia is just great . 
  glad they take part in all that silly stuff coming out of europe !, 
  it would be unthinkable if the nazis were still in charge . 
  nowadays germany is like any other western country in my opinion . 
  not that i want more nukes in germany , but come on . 
  where poland who gets the most money out of the eu , does n't profit at all i guess . 
  haha , great . 
  let him twitter , he is n't the best speaker anyway . 
  ah what the hell , might just vote for him than . 
  ca n't stand merkel anymore . 
  more a geographical thing i think . 
  another reason is ... you got russia on your doorstep . 
  at the moment , we only got 6 subs too i think . 
  just now we started to spend more on our navy ... 4 frigates ( f125 class ) and 5 destroyers/multi functional ships ( mks 180 class ) . 
  in german news media they reported about 4 subs ? 
  edit : norwegian media is also reporting about 4 subs , not 6 . 
  great news , thanks norway !, 
  `` commutes of europe '', 
  actually it 's not . 
  just check some other images [ http://www.weinerelementary.org/uploads/2/2/8/6/22867982/310091572.jpg] ( http://www.weinerelementary.org/uploads/2/2/8/6/22867982/310091572.jpg ), 
  well , if you go by that ... 1/3 of the world would be british clay i guess, 
  well , ask the danes as we got the land from them . 
  * triggered *, 
  just do n't tell eesti, 
  rotterdam ( netherlands ) , antwerp ( belgium ) are the two biggest ports with hamburg in europe . 
  guess that 's where those figures are coming from ? 
  impressive nevertheless . 
  [ ode to joy i grand opening light show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdbgw_virs ), 
  probably older people . 
  also , bavaria has different regions like franconia where i live and we do n't consider us typical bavarians .
