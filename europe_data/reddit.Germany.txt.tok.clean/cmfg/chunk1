[ nope ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/lieberoser_wueste_21.jpg ), 
  the [ black midi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipa-8pytn58 ) version gets good at about 1:30 . 
  i would rip my ears off if i had to listen to that accent . 
  i would n't be able to stop myself from giving a 2000 year history crash course . 
  but his german is worse than google translate , as usual . 
  that 's completely understandable , and it * was * made as part of a propaganda effort to distract from the war . 
  but there is no nazi-propaganda in the film itself , only nostalgia about school in the ` good old days ' , and it has become quite a cult film today . 
  for that time period , i have to mention [ die feuerzangenbowle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_feuerzangenbowle_\\ ( 1944_film \\ ) ) ( 1944 ) , although it 's not a silent film . 
  no germans in that video . 
  finnish and french sound totally different , but both massively cute . 
  neitherway . 
  i hate having to wait for the weather !, 
  switzerland , the ch , its top level domain and general abbreviation , is derived from its latin name , confoederatio helvetica . 
  showing my ignorance here , but should n't schengen cover that if op has a valid visa for germany ? 
  the milk-in-bags-buyers of europe . 
  the corporate headquarters with the golden throne is the least materialistic ? 
  oops . 
  there was a case yesterday , where two men were lost for three days on an island in the river isar through munich , basically in the middle of the city . 
  went over when the water was low and were then trapped by the rain . 
  a gallon is one of those fantasy words from harry potter , is n't it . 
  no machicolations on the towers , 5/10 . 
  and i hope you will only get english breakfast for the rest of * your * life !, 
  french bread is a pastry , german bread is for people who fell trees with their bare hands . 
  this time through switzerland !, 
   full english now here is something revolting . 
  i would think that americans of all people would not condone handing undeserved hereditary power to the descendants of the biggest bastards and thieves from a few hundred years ago . 
  every time the party is mentioned in german news , they deliberately pronounce it with a long i ( in spite of the rules of german pronunciation ) to avoid the association . 
  [ advertisers know that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eram9y_rhvq ), 
  fat and salt , i guess . 
  does not compute, 
  that was the running gag about the euro from day one , and it got old by day two . 
  [ southern and western germany + austria + switzerland ] ( https://www.philhist.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/germanistik/sprachwissenschaft/ada/runde_5/f01b/ ) seem to be christkind-country . 
  honestly , the examples here may have a strong accent , but they are perfectly understandable . 
  i will take the czech accent any day . 
  ^ also ^ it ^ sounds ^ a ^ lot ^ like ^ my ^ accent, 
  are you sitting in corners a lot ? 
  all rooms in my family 's house have locks , but only the very old kind you can open with a piece of bent wire . 
  if cz is western european , where does eastern europe start ? 
  east of moscow ? 
  context : natascha kampusch was kidnapped at the age of 10 , and held in an underground soundproofed vault for 8 years before escaping . 
  even tom scott errs sometimes . 
  / thread, 
  i liked the sci-fi solution in a book i read , where the alien translator device would just say `` i render appropriate greetings '' . 
  i propose this as a solution to our cultural misunderstandings . 
  [ tom scott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfhguu_8kga ) ( best brit around ) explains why it came to be this way . 
  i 'm not sure the black block does want anything more from the government than having an excuse to brawl , loot , set cars on fire , and playing cat and mouse with the police . 
  i like `` was your father a glassblower ? '', 
  for people who block ones view . 
  well , scamming is a strong word . 
  the companies compare genetic markers of a person to the ones generally found in a certain area and then oversimplify the results , which the people then misunderstand further to mean what you wrote . 
  it 's crazy easy . 
  also hitler and gandhi . 
  i know the feeling . 
  if you mean franconia , that 's a region in northern bavaria . 
  in fact the best region in the whole of germany . 
  but it 's independence day day , the day where you celebrate one of the best popcorn movies about an alien invasion !, 
  you forgot elsa\u00df-lothringen !, 
  prei\u00dfen : prussians ( northern germans ) fischk\u00f6pfe : fish heads ( northern costal germans ), 
  i will start referring to that region as the irish iles . 
  every time i see that sub linked i have to think of murcia first . 
  in some words and dialects e does sound like \u00e4 , but not in others . 
  major source of spelling errors for children . 
  german has surprisingly many vowel sounds . 
  would you be mad if i told you that i do n't like the watery taste of watermelons and subsequently do n't eat any unless societal pressures force me to ? 
  well , germany is a bit different in this regard . 
  apart from the government there is hardly anything important in berlin , and the city itself is , let 's say , not universally loved by all . 
  steal their technology of course . 
  by the way , read the short story `` the road not taken '' from the same author . 
  came here to recommend that to op . 
  hammerfest , a ) because the name is so badass , and b ) there will be an impenetrable gdi fortress there . 
  i think those common mistakes come from transferring concepts from ones own language into english , subconsciously or not . 
  i learn the word person ( en . ), 
  means person ( ger . 
  ) , but do n't learn all the associated nuances . 
  in german it would be absolutely common to say `` ich m\u00f6chte einen tisch f\u00fcr drei personen reservieren '' so i apply what i know and it ends up as '' i would like to reserve a table for three persons . '', 
  about w/v thing , there is n't really a meaningful difference in german between them , as is between the english s/z . 
  in standard german the s and z sounds do both appear , but will never change the meaning of a word , and some dialects ( like mine ) will not make a difference at all . 
  and the th sound is just a foreign object , so it 's no wonder we have trouble with it , if we never used it growing up .

  \u00c4nd is zer won for \u0292 aloun , lajk in `` pleasure '' ? 
  ok , but is this just stilted or bad style , or is it a mistake mistake ? 
  wait , what is wrong with `` we are three persons '' ?

  on the other hand , they should just finally introduce gay marriage and decriminalize cannabis . 
  having a german passport means you are allowed to work in any eu country . 
  and also to study , so you may think about doing that to acclimate yourself . 
  germanic languages unite !,
