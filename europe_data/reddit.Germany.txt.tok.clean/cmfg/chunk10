  some nice features : grammar fits on one page , there are no exceptions or irregularities . 
  spelling is phonetic , ie it 's spelled like it 's spoken and vice versa . 
  words are chosen from european languages , especially romance languages but all over . 
  practical use is limited , i know nobody else in real life that speaks it . 
  used if a few times online to chat to people . 
  really like esperanto , and the idea of [ making international communication easy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yhalnlv9xu ) , it 's a shame it never got popular . 
  i do n't think so , in my experience hardly any french person can speak german . 
  [ this website ] ( http://languageknowledge.eu/countries/france ) seems to confirm it , with only about 5 % of them in any age group speaking german . 
  beware of he who would deny you access to information , for in his heart he dreams himself your master . 
  so why have you still not converted to the si system like civilized people ? 
  white russia, 
  also , [ south georgia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_georgia_and_the_south_sandwich_islands ) is not where you would expect it . 
  ne , germanio . 
  sooo , cerl ? 
  it is very easily solvable . 
  the formula gives you the time depending on x , where x = 0 means the crocodile swims straight across , t = 110 ( ii ) and x = 20 where it does not travel on land but the shortest path directly t = 5 * sqrt ( 436 ) = 104.4 ... ( i ) . 
  now you only need to find the minimum of t ( x ) , easiest way is to set the first derivative = 0 , which gives you the solution x = 8 , t ( 8 ) = 98 . 
  if yo want to be a pedant you can now prove that it is in fact a minimum , so 2nd derivative or t ( 8 + - h ) , and bam you are done . 
  that 's 5 minutes work . 
  meant the third world war , but the whole counting thing gets confusing . 
  that 's what you get when a german tries to make a joke . 
  third time 's the charm !, 
   afsluitdijk now you are just smashing random keys . 
  eu = greater frankish empire !, 
  i thought we were already adopting mexico . 
  while there is probably bias in the choice of battles , keep in mind [ the british have invaded a lot of countries ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9653497/british-have-invaded-nine-out-of-ten-countries-so-look-out-luxembourg.html ), 
  let 's better go with something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc56moy0poa ), 
  it kind of was with the primaries . 
  i 'm imagining poland and the baltics are putting their forces on lookout for little green men . 
  the word i hear the most on german tv is `` shock '' . 
  we are surprised of it , and afraid of what trump might break . 
  67 % * for * trump in germany ? 
  in your dreams . 
  it was  80 % against him . 
  post pictures . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  i was really surprised that poland does n't already . 
  and a perfect example of french-german cooperation . 
  the plural-ending and the word for `` and '' is taken from ancient greek . 
  i know some words that came from lithuanian and finnish . 
  but ok , it 's not perfectly representative . 
  but esperanto is a hell of a lot better than the languages on the market trying to be europes lingua franca in so many ways . 
  easy to learn , totally regular , very expressive . 
  i really think that esperanto as a second language ( or something similar if need be ) could be , if people would look at it objectively without nationalistic interests , an obvious boon for europe . 
  it is said that bing video search is good for adult entertainment . 
  the munich team is the only one i can stand watching . 
  all the rest are just bathing ii depression . 
  for purposes of fairness they should use finnish . 
  i 'll support your idea if you rename britain to landing strip one . 
  and that 's why we need australia or canada . 
  ^ ^ just ^ ^ kidding, 
  i wonder why they chose not to include solar panels . 
  ok , more weight and thus more costs , but would it not be worth it to have a nice little weather station on mars ? 
  you know what is childish ? 
  me always having to giggle about ` la grande arche '' at la defense . 
  it 's interesting , there are a number of these organizations which that kind of weird independent status . 
  cern and eso for example come to mind . 
  makes international cooperation easier , i guess . 
  swiss german somehow manages to be both harsh and cute . 
  to be fair , the norwegian model would allow for more uk opt-outs in some areas . 
  if that is a good idea is another question , of course . 
  now that you mention it , amazon.co.uk will be great in the time from article 50 to article 50 + 2 years . 
  ice spiders , i hear . 
  winning streak against france since 1870 . 
  british houses can be ridiculously small . 
  stairs where you ca n't pass somebody else , really ? 
  if we counted all previous popes hanging around the vatican , the number would probably be in the hundreds . 
  there are countless programs from the eu to support science , education , culture , regional development and whatnot . 
  the eu seems to be bad at advertising the stuff they do . 
  you might like [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qytzb/what_are_some_of_the_free_benefits_that_the_eu/ ) about a similar question , and [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4si5q6/remember_the_european_website_for_free_books_and/ ) that shows you actually can get free stuff from the eu bookstore . 
  and even within bavaria , those things are only common in the `` altbayern '' - regions , not with the swabians and franconians, 
  if you compared the technical finesse of the moon landing and rosetta , rosetta would win , just because there have been decades of advances since . 
  but that 's not really a fair comparison because they are very different things . 
  it 's like comparing a ww2 battleship to a solar powered carbon fiber ship . 
  the later one is more advanced and does amazing things . 
  but the former has a lot more impact . 
  [ the playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trljrwtbr4w&amp;list=plbyvawxscnbui_ncl9uq_fxlojs4snsd8 ) as a whole makes a nice ( and a bit sad ) story . 
  we shall call it latin-europe . 
  any parody to elf-dwarf racism i try to write sounds so much like nazi propaganda that it scares me . 
  i ca n't do it . 
  call me a bigot from yesterday , but for me marriage should be and should only be betweem one human being and another human being . 
  or maybe multiple human beings , i do n't really care . 
  but definitely not between elf and human . 
  that 's just unnatural . 
  damn those dirty elf-lovers . 
  for comparison : [ map of beer gardens in bavaria ] ( https://geoportal.bayern.de/bayernatlas/index.html?x=mxqru4iqocu4ycve4r70poet1yakv1edbp0-hf-xjzbl1qjd6clal-r0hcf4qk6or0fbbk0paqysbslfcstittxoqoubo*fu&amp;x=5421649.25&amp;y=4459462.00&amp;zoom=3&amp;lang=de&amp;topic=ba&amp;bglayer=atkis&amp;layers=a90c75a0-f1b5-46e7-9e45-c0385fd0c200 ), 
  we could change the eu-official label for the uk to `` landing strip one '' just to annoy them . 
  there was a big piece about it on heute journal a few days ago , but it is rare . 
  * not sure if nazi allusion *, 
  saying `` bloody hell '' makes me feel so posh . 
  that sounds like `` we are looking to provide a tax haven for an upcoming industry with unclear legal status * . 
  * minister president of bavaria, 
  everyone forgets the german colonies . 
  [ europa !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc56moy0poa ), 
  have fun on your island . 
  the eu should start preparing to throw the uk out , instead of waiting forever for them to trigger article 50 . 
  americans argue that the imperial system makes sense , so ... 
  apparently in american chocolate there is substantially more butyric acid , which leads to a taste that many find repulsive . 
  everyone except ex-chancellor helmut schmidt .
