  he would smoke in public buildings and even on public television in a time when both was forbidden for years . 
  tom scott is one of those people who can talk about anything for a few minutes and always make it interesting . 
  you are right , he could n't realistically tell everyone that homosexuality is ok . catholics in ( northern ? ), 
  europe would be fine probably , but southern america and africa would freak out . 
  on the other hand we ca n't read the popes mind . 
  we do n't know if wants to push for equality , but has only very limited leeway , or that he wants to keep catholic doctrine ( which very much forbids same sex marriages at the moment ) , but has to give symbolic concessions to modern western sensibilities . 
  i would be surprised of the pope allowed same sex marriages in 20 years , but let 's see . 
  i have the feeling he just got a better pr guy than the last one . 
  he did not change any teachings of the catholic church , including  in 2013 , pope francis reaffirmed the roman catholic church 's position that homosexual acts were sinful , but homosexual orientation was not . 
  i find it amazing anyone believed facebook it would not use the personal info of whatsapp users . 
  that 's like believing a slaughterhouse it wont kill the cows it bought . 
  i like to imagine a european colonization starship on its way to alpha centauri , where the british section is constantly threatening to trigger article 50 . 
  [ cern convention ] ( http://council.web.cern.ch/council/en/governance/convention.html ) article ii :  the organization shall have no concern with work for military requirements and the results of its experimental and theoretical work shall be published or otherwise made generally available . 
  [ there are fees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cern#member_states_and_budget ) . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/13/how-much-does-it-cost-eurovision-song-contest-and-is-it-worth-it/ ) says the eurovision in azerbaijan cost 48 million pounds , which is more than most cern member states pay per year . 
  you could have waited until 5:45 . 
  never been there myself . 
  looks nice , but judging from the climate table i would not like it there in summer , but probably in winter . 
  in august i would rather go to somewhere like iceland . 
  again , my subjectiv opinon . 
  funny , i 've never seen that , and would have interpreted it the exact opposite way , as explicitly being serious . 
  i 'll stay with '' / s '' . 
  til about kingdom of the two sicilies . 
  but no offense , personally i 'd rather have france with its reasonable climate than southern italy . 
  even rome is unbearably hot . 
  but to each their own . 
  charlemagne would rotate in his grave !, 
  giving up half the empire !, 
  that 's not too far from the truth . 
  before germany was unified the whole area was a [ massively splintered ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/hrr_1400.png ) . 
  nothing , but it sounds nice . 
  more than either would admit , especially compared to germany north of bavaria . 
  still , you can immediately hear a difference in the respective accents , and it is the first duty of every franconian to be offended if he is called a bavarian by some prussian pig . 
  i 'm no lawyer , but that sounds like a very hard problem to solve , and one that becomes harder over time , if the eu and uk drift apart . 
  exceptions for scotland would pile up and up . 
  but what if there is a conflict between eu law and uk law ? 
  which takes precedence ? 
  [ i got that reference . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkie-vgugdi ), 
  for european ears , bernie sanders sounded pretty centrist/center-left . 
  actual `` left-left '' - wingers here are quite a bit distant from him politically . 
  mildly . 
  they are such a tiny minority here that they are not really on peoples minds , whereas there are 2-3 million turks in germany . 
  well , it 's * because * it has such a large turkish population , of which a significant part has failed to integrate , or germany has failed to integrate them , whatever your perspective is . 
  there is some degree of resentment on both sides , and people who will not associate with the other group . 
  it 's probably fair to say that from all immigrants/descends of immigrants the turks ( who are by far the biggest group ) have the worst reputation . 
  at least that was the case before the migrant crisis , that created lot more resentment . 
  fun fact , [ depp in german ] ( http://www.dict.cc/?s=depp ) means something like idiot . 
  so from now on we measure everything good in terms of `` percent norway '' . 
  yea , that cake is like 70 % norway . 
  in that dark alley i feel only 15 % norway . 
  i 'm so glad these people seem to be completely incompetent in their atrocities, 
  so does that start at eastern germany or only at poland ? 
  * simplaj  simpla ( must be singular ) * frazoj  frazojn ( must be in accusative case ) * azeno  pugo ( azeno is the animal called ass , not the body part ), 
  i do n't think there exists technology to make these screens possible . 
  in normal video conferencing the camera is near the screen . 
  when it is near enough and the screen is not too big , it almost looks good , but still the other side will see you looking slightly off . 
  if you make the screens huge , you simply can not look at the screen and into the camera at the same time . 
  to get what they want you would have to somehow integrate thousands of cameras into the screen and do pretty fancy real time image processing to make it work . 
  again , i do n't think that exists . 
   also turkey has finally been accepted as an eu member for similar reasons . 
  not buying it . 
  i mean , dutch is basically drunk german for beginners . 
  franconia remembers . 
  i sympathize with those people , but i feel they just hurt themselves with their vote . 
  now all that eu regional development disappears , and i do n't think the london elites they were talking about will be eager to replace them . 
  abd it looks like the uk will start deregulating and lowering taxes to stay attractive , again probably not that they really wanted . 
  and i was pointing out the even greater ease of using numbers , be it integer or real . 
  how in the world is `` three eggs '' a hard concept to understand ? 
  mr. bean wearing a bowler hat drinking tea with the queen ? 
   it 's big brother germany you are warming my heart . 
  the difference being that esperanto forces everything to be phonetic and regular , while in english you are out of luck regarding spelling and pronunciation . 
  for a century , esperanto has been trying to be that language . 
  it looked good for a time , but hitler and stalin were not fans of it , and after ww2 english became the de facto lingua franco . 
  still , people try to push for it . 
  personally i like the idea , but at least on reddit , that idea does not generally resonate . 
  the queen in the north tries for independence , while the throne in the south is under contention , global warming is coming , and an alliance from another continent wants to take over , or something like that . 
  it 's real esperanto . 
  fun fact , google translate [ understands ] ( https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/mi%20konsentas . ), 
  esperanto ( mostly ), 
   how is it `` less expensive '' ? 
  studies show esperanto is much easier and faster to learn than other languages , incl . 
  english . 
  so you would save on language teaching , translation services and so on . 
   how many people speak esperanto currently ? 
  wikipedia : `` up to 2,000,000 people worldwide , to varying degrees , speak esperanto , including about 1,000 to 2,000 native speakers who learned esperanto from birth . '', 
   how much money and human effort will it take for people all over europe to learn esparanto ? 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fran%c3%a7ois_grin#grin.27s_report ) : `` the report argues that adoption of esperanto would save the eu 25 billion euros a year ( over $ 54 per inhabitant ) . '', 
  the thing is , you continually have to teach new people , so i would put the question rather like this : we need to choose a language/languages that enable people to communicate across europe . 
  should we choose established idiosyncratic ones , or one that is at the moment hardly used , but much easier to learn and use ? 
  and i came to the conclusion , the second options makes more sense to me . 
  apparently about 2 % of words are from slavic languages , yea , not a lot . 
  `` the sound inventory is essentially slavic , as is much of the semantics '' , that 's at least something . 
  also , the alphabet looks inspired from slavic languages , with letters like \u0109 and \u015d . 
  i completely agree . 
  people really should have an open minded look at esperanto before they dismiss it . 
  it would save so much time money and effort , as for example [ this report ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fran%c3%a7ois_grin#third_scenario:_esperanto ) shows . 
  i really do n't understand the logic behind half those comments : how the hell do you get from brexit to sending away muslims and black people ? 
  the northern british kingdom ? 
  the united non-englanders ?
