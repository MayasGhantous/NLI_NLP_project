  germany is producing a shitton of military hardware , it just sells most of it . 
  so it would have no problems getting ready quickly . 
  not that that would be a good idea . 
  [ what he is trying to do ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/jurassicpark/images/b/b0/dilophosaurus.gif ), 
  nightmare, 
  same superiority complex , it seems . 
  forcing people to abandon their language would disastrous . 
  but teaching everyone a common second language would be helpful . 
  ideally something easier than english ; i still favor esperanto , it 's still alive . 
  i was thinking more of notices from inside the house , music , tv , talking , snoring , sex , etc. 
  but ca n't you hear everything through such walls ? 
  that would annoy me to no end . 
  i see . 
  no offense , but i prefer the way it is , which is basically the english system , to your system . 
  ok , 20 as two-zero would work , but for higher numbers get confusing fast . 
  2 million is 2-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero when spoken ? 
  does not sound like a good idea . 
  they could just buy those endlessly long videos of trains going from one end of europe to the other . 
  i heard there are also videos of ships just doing what ships do . 
  compare to [ this map of germanic languages ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/germanic_languages.svg ) . 
  i really do n't want to take up your whole day arguing about esperanto , but ... 
  the two syllable estas is clumsy , but imho not tragic . 
  i 've heard it being shortened to ` stas when spoken . 
  having \u015di and li makes sense if you want to able to translate to and from languages which have it , you would often lose meaning if you could n't . 
  but having not having a neutral personal pronoun , like the recent singular `` they '' in english , is indeed stupid , at least from todays perspective . 
  but there is discussion ( which i support ) to introduce such a word , like \u015dli or ri . 
  how horrible that particular issue is , is probably a matter of perspective . 
  esperanto is n't perfect , nothing ever is . 
  i regard it as a reasonable compromise . 
  you are perfectly free to dislike it . 
  but just out of curiosity , can you leave out the copula in your native language ? 
  well , because that would just mean `` the blue sky . '', 
  putting an adjective before or after a noun is equivalent in esperanto . 
  ( probably to make it easier for french , italian and spanish speakers ), 
  two syllables instead of one as in the languages i know of , yes , a bit bulky . 
  but you can actually circumvent that by verbifying your adjective . 
  so , the sky is blue , `` la \u0109ielo estas blua '' , can also be said as `` la \u0109ielo bluas '' . 
  i 'm not married to esperanto , it just happens to be the one i learned , and i came to like its simple elegance and flexibility . 
  but if another language serves the purpose better , be it interlingua or some language still to be invented , i will happily promote that instead . 
  esperanto has some things in favor of it :  100 years continuous use , established speaker-base ( possibly millions of speakers of various skill ) , extensive and stable vocabulary . 
  in what way ? 
  i would like that , and think that would bring lots of benefits . 
  problem is , the people will fight tooth and nail . 
  `` the evil eu bureaucrats want to stamp out our local culture and replace it with an artificial newspeak ! '', 
  i actually believe in earnest that esperanto would be a great choice for a auxiliary eu language . 
  i have never managed to convince someone that is something you could in fact implement , though . 
  if you wanted to get back into esperanto , there is a very nice free cource on duolingo.com, 
  fun fact , the german federal eagle depicted on that coin is often called `` fat hen '' . 
  [ germany ] is there some football game going on ? 
  if it 's any consolation , the thieving poles jokes died  10 years ago . 
  captain germany is misnamed . 
  he should be captain bavaria , or more realistically , captain giftshop oktoberfest . 
  we are all harold . 
  they did n't even have a rainbow !, 
  when i looked at the chart i thought it said the average russian has 60 cats . 
  it 's a retarded demon lizard , amazing . 
  no , not burn-cars-in-berlin-day !, 
  maybe not the savings per hour , but per year . 
  looking at that number is very striking . 
  swabia , if i recall . 
  if it counts , esperanto has only vi , used the same as english you . 
  wasn ? 
  calling franconia prussian is inexcusable . 
  interestingly , in english ships and other vehicles are also female . 
  you could write a letter and send a courier to the library of alexandria , i heard they know of many things . 
  it 's one of the very few times where a new standard has been adopted world wide . 
  at least i think so , i ca n't think of any place that 's still black and white .

  i 've never met a non-native english speaker who can pronounce all of it correctly . 
  it seems to be standard to have a historical , scientific , etc adviser and then completely ignore them . 
  maybe arte will broadcast it thursdays at 3:40 sometime after 2037 . 
  written science fiction is streets ahead of film and tv . 
  just two words : the culture . 
  post-brexit plan to spend # 500m ` creating blue passports in honor of eu ' is already under way, 
  you do n't have to force them , they do it voluntarily .

  how so ? 
  duolingo and memrize are useful to keep your skill up to date . 
  please enjoy the [ universal declaration of human rights ] ( https://eo.wikisource.org/wiki/universala_deklaracio_de_homaj_rajtoj ) and the wikipedia article about [ quantum field theory ] ( https://eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvantuma_kampa_teorio ) in esperanto . 
  but i 'm still not convinced it 's human-readable . 
  well , if i would argue in esperanto , only the ones already speaking it would understand , and they do n't need convincing . 
  it 's a bit of an chicken-and-egg problem . 
  i 'm actually convinced that would an amazing idea . 
  it takes years to become fluent in english or german or french . 
  it takes a fraction of that to become fluent in esperanto because it 's so damn regular and takes common words from european languages . 
  and it 's a `` fully functional '' language , you can express everything as well as in any other , its wikipedia is bigger than some other european languages , etc. 
  yes and no , in some areas there was a physical wall , like at the [ rhaetian limes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upper_germanic-rhaetian_limes ) is was refering to . 
  may i introduce you to the [ limes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limes ) , the wall ( mostly ) in germany ?

  if i knew nothing about him and met him at a barbecue , he would probably be fun . 
  note : i 'm not a woman . 
  i wonder how much truth there is to that . 
  in a way it fits with the traditional first rule of british foreign policy : make sure that no single power in europe gains the upper hand . 
  to be honest , most people can not tell you three little countries up there apart . 
  / r/europe is a great place to learn about all of europe 's endless splinter groups and why they hate each other . 
  i suppose poland has similar thoughts about germany .
