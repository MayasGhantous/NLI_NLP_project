  hear hear . 
  although i could be mention the montgolfier brothers for flight , since you do n't specify what kind of flight . 
  but technicalities aside , anybody claiming any nation has invented everything or everything of importance , is just wrong . 
  have you considered writing a book and having it read out by someone like stephen fry ? 
  wait what, 
  you hoping for [ this scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we6ewdn01km&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3112 ) ? 
  will have been ... . 
  for the next two years , the uk is still paying as usual . 
  same thing at cern . 
  i could n't disagree more . 
  it 's sleek , elegant and beautiful . 
  and the number of stars never represented the number of members . 
  are you trying to export the \u00dc smiley into europe ? 
  after a few minutes of that it starts to sound like `` belieb me ! '', 
  it 's peru . 
  just look how masterful they have hidden their intentions against sweden so far , nobody suspects them . 
  that 's definite proof in my book . 
  i though - ski is polish . 
  was n't austria part of the holy roman empire ? 
  out of curiosity i went to the one in my city ( munich ) today . 
  their setup was about what we had at the party at the end of our final school year . 
  a truck with some speakers and a banner on the back . 
  they also had a few tables where they gave out little paper eu flags , which google tells me cost 39 cent , probably less in bulk . 
  some people had bigger flags which i see for under five euro on amazon . 
  the top speakers were a comedian from the local radio station saying how much he dislikes hate , and an ex member of the eu parliament telling some boring anecdote . 
  i do n't know if you are near one of the cites where this is happening , but if you are i recommend you have a look at it with your own eyes . 
  because what i saw i could have paid for and organized with a handful of friends . 
  it 's kind of funny how half of europe thinks they are the true heirs of rome . 
  neat , that esa short was fantastic . 
  in varietate concordia !, 
  and rocks . 
  i never understood british humor . 
  greece gives us +10 culture . 
  if only french was n't so hard . 
  watching dubbed stuff is convenient , and with 100 million german speakers , the market is big enough to make it profitable . 
  it would be neat , but it would have problems here in germany , where almost nothing is subtitled , but dubbed . 
  some cinemas will show original versions in english , but that would n't help a movie that 's part czech , part finnish and part portuguese . 
  so far nobody tried to write it that way , too crazy even for germans . 
  the franconian identity is flexible . 
  it depends entirely on context whether franconia and the franconians are definitely or definitely not part of bavaria . 
  you spelled `` envy '' wrong . 
  by bavarian custom everything german north of bavaria is prussia . 
  a person who likes rye is a person i can trust . 
  admit it , you just invented the last one . 
  the weather is pretty nice in the south . 
  really , as long as you do n't go to hamburg looking for nice weather , you 're fine . 
  would you say you are a * quantum mechanic * ? 
  see , the a-an distinction is harder , because you have to go by the sound , not the letter . 
  also it 's and its , there , they 're and their . 
  or has it not gone too far enough ? 
  finally we can enter dep ocean tiles !, 
  the desert planet greenworld , the jungle planet antarctica , and the water planet sahara ii . 
  collaboration is generally a thing in science . 
  institutions around the world share their findings all the time . 
  and then when results are presented , it 's understood to give proper credit . 
  scientists normally err on the side of caution in making sure everyone is mentioned . 
  [ 5040 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jm2oimb9qg ) is a pretty interesting number . 
  that would become exhausting pretty fast . 
  over time , trump takes every stance on every issue . 
  there is still an esperanto underground around , still new people learning it . 
  but yeah , the big movement from the early 20th century is pretty dead . 
  a shame , if you ask me . 
  we like to imagine we are more enlightened than that now . 
  if we try to solve every possible border dispute in europe by force ( and thanks to 2000 years of history , we have a lot of them ) this continent will drown in war again . 
  can we please not ? 
   \u0468 looks like linear-b,

  can we not just * buy * greece and be done with it ? 
  i wished we would import the first two into german , would make it more compact . 
  also eastern european names and words would stop looking so crazy in german . 
  najs traj , bat ju stil h\u00e4f sam sajlent leters in jur post . 
  the accented letters look a bit frightening in the beginning , but the whole language is pretty well thought out and easy to learn .

  you would love esperanto , it 's [ littered with j ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esperanto#sample_text ) . 
  you 're right , i actually do pronounce them differently . 
  i never noticed . 
  aj newer notisd . 
  either spell it color or pronounce it french , your choice . 
  w\u00e4jt , \u03b8er ar tu kajnds of `` th '' in ingli\u015d ? 
  calm down buddy , that was a joke . 
  nuclear armageddon , that old buzz kill . 
  but seriously , i sympathize with the people of gibraltar being caught between bigger interests . 
  you know , a little war can do wonders for uniting a country . 
  worked well for germany 1870/71 . 
  maybe the eu needs the gibraltar war of 2019 to unite . 
  ( i 'm kidding , of course . 
  or am i ? 
  yes . ), 
  fear not , we shall come up with a new trend . 
  jackets of europe ? 
  trams of europe ? 
  mountains ? 
  battlefields ? 
  legends , shoes , trees ? 
  the french are so hardcore , they eat pain for breakfast . 
  [ or the galactic empire ] ( http://theredwire.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/caef0sj.jpg ), 
  `` since 5:45 we are shooting back '' . 
  iconic words from the hitler speech announcing the invasion of poland .
