  because , did you know poland was the one attacking first ( ^ according ^ to ^ hitler ) ? 
  all problems on the balkans would stop if they all just joined erdogans turkey . 
  you downvote , but it 's true . 
  it is expected of him to stop being involved in party politics and act as the * german * president , not the * spd * president . 
  there is a surprising number of `` ode to joy '' flash mobs ob youtube . 
   the procedures were absolutely legal . 
  `` we were legally legalizing our corruption , why are you so angry ? '', 
  the nerve . 
  as long as we still have rye and spelt . 
  are you saying someone convicted of electoral fraud is somehow untrustworthy ? 
  but does it have brakes ? 
  everyone would be lucky to land a job there . 
  let 's hope the project takes off . 
  someone should make a website to track everybody who profited from this law . 
  something like : ** these corrupt politicians are not in jail because other corrupt politicians legalized their corruption '' ** and then make sure the public never forgets their names and crimes . 
  every time a newspaper mentions one of without acknowledging their crimes , write a letter to the editor . 
  make it impossible for them to run for any post without reminding everybody what they have done . 
   justice minister florin iordache said the measure will decriminalize cases of official misconduct in which the financial damage is valued at less than 200,000 lei ( $ 47,800 ) . 
  just wow . 
  remember , remember , the 9th of marchember ... 
  why do we keep lying and saying turkey has a chance of ever joining ? 
  caught in a landslide ? 
  that 's like six degrees of wikipedia for shitposting . 
  you 're trying to see how far the cattle of europe ban goes , right ? 
  i vote for bridges next , we have some nice ones . 
  do you want to start a world war ? 
  because that would be a good way to start one . 
  these days only the french are building one tiny castle . 
  we should petition the eu to build the ultimate castle , the biggest and awesomest castle in all of history . 
  poland , get the wings . 
  it 's a bit sad that we do n't build castles anymore . 
  and i do n't mean like gu\u00e9delon , but modern designs build with modern technologies . 
  bonus : on a different hill nearby is a [ bismarck tower ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/bismarckturm_wei%c3%9fenburg.jpg ) , one of 240 once scattered around germany . 
  towers of europe , anyone ? 
  afrikaans is almost dutch . 
  well , on paper . 
  so , are we thinking hyperloop will be the next big thing or the next big flop ? 
  very true ... 
  [ correction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjdrlwr-yfm ), 
  just ask him on twitter . 
  latex somehow manages to be the worst and best tool simultaneously . 
  if it works for erdogan , it should work for us : give us money or we will send * them * to you . 
  let 's turn it around : we import - in exchange for a lot of money - all of europes hipsters into berlin , and make it an official hipster dump/zoo . 
  something like selenopolis , does someone here speak ( ancient ? ), 
  greece ? 
  the problem is , the npd is relatively harmless because they are so blunt and rough . 
  [ they look like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/npd_kundgebung_wuerzburg.jpg ) and act and talk like you would imagine from your common neonazi . 
  there is no question they stand for violence and extremism . 
  the afd wears the face of the common man . 
  they do n't talk about the subhuman parasites deserve ( d ) to be gassed . 
  they talk about how order and stability . 
  and how we should not let us be held back by history . 
  and that there were good parts in german history , and we should concentrate more on those . 
  and maybe the other parts were not so bad as they all say . 
  there have been multiple instances where they tried to bring back words that are not * quite * definitely from nazi vocabulary , but were suspiciously popular from 1938-1945 . 
  nothing official of course , more like some politicians speculating . 
  i still remember when there was talk about russia joining nato not many years ago . 
  i thought they are called sanescobaros . 
  i could n't agree more . 
  with national languages you have to put in years in school , and even after that only some people know enough for basic conversations . 
  and if you talk to a native speaker , you are automatically at a disadvantage . 
  a neutral and easy to learn second language like esperanto would solve all that . 
  just keep in mind that berlin is where we put all our hipsters , so the rest of us does n't have to deal with them . 
  there are some attempts to make a kind of neo-latin , which would be easier to use , like latino sine flexione or interlingua . 
  and of course esperanto , which everyone should totally learn . 
  seriously , a common neutral easy to learn second language would be a boon to europe . 
  and i do n't mean english . 
  we could bring back the holy roman empire . 
  added benefit , it would make those isis ramblings about war against rome make more sense . 
  or ecumene , although that has too much religious connotations these days . 
  or if you want to keep the scifi theme , we could use the culture , i always thought that was a nice goal to strive toward . 
  that would have a lot of advantages . 
  lots of time and money saved compared to other languages , and everybody could talk to each other on neutral ground . 
  oh yes . 
  there were parts where a paragraph that elegantly showed something which took a two hour lecture otherwise . 
  but i really think you need to be an actual genius to understand those books , so i did n't get too far . 
  the greatest thing i ever failed at . 
  you sound like littlefinger . 
  and are correct . 
  i like the first one , although is looks kind of like doublesweden . 
  here are [ my proposals ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nsczc ) for the `` lithuanian flag nobody asked for contest 2017 '', 
  you could have made the shield into a flag , that looks pretty cool . 
  even if bavaria wanted to become independent of germany ( which apart from a very small number of people on the fringe it * does n't * ) , why in the world would it leave the eu ? 
  we can switch to `` blame the english '' , it 's what we mean anyway . 
  he looks so uncomfortable . 
  there was an image of a german flag in the same style floating around . 
  it was a sunset , i think . 
  very nice . 
  [ tv used to be so much better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slyw7kkhyi4 ), 
  my main problem is that it 's hard to chant `` eu !, 
  so i just put my hand on my heart and start to sing freude sch\u00d6ner g\u00d6tterfunken ... 
  i had to laugh so much at the [ intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aepiwejmzye&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=222 ) of the press conference announcing the detection of gravitational waves . 
  the americans did n't find it funny . 
  compare to the [ announcement ] ( https://youtu.be/9iogalzof7k?t=6240 ) of the higgs boson , where after two hours of technical summaries the director general of cern had to explicitly say that yes , that means we found it . 
  my home is just barely on the other side . 
  i always joke germany celebrates arminius for saving us from civilization . 
  and then later claiming the very same for ourself . 
  damn , i missed this discussion . 
  i should really finish my bot that alerts me of discussions about esperanto , so i can argue for it . 
  elendiche !,
