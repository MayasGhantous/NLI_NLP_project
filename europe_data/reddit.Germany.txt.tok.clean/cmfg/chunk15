  that makes sense .

  br\u00fcssel is the capital of the predominantly proper german speaking eu ; yet it 's all in in either swamp german or island monkey german ?

  what 's so bad about the moon ? 
  unless you go into terraforming , you should be able to do everything on the moon that you can do on mars . 
  maybe they do n't want to be liable when more atrocities from empire times come to light . 
  just let them drive themselves . 
  i would love to see the hard numbers on this road . 
  how much power does it make , how long will it last , how much did it cost to build , and then a comparison to solar panels on the field next to the road , or on roof above the road , both angled toward the sun . 
  because i have the strong feeling the road is the worst possible solution . 
  ^ i ^ just ^ wanted ^ to ^ spread ^ pointless ^ discord, 
  think of it in terms of economic stimulus , does n't spain have a big construction industry deep in crisis ? 
  damn portugal , they were never real europeans !, 
  edit : calm down people , that was a joke !, 
  who in the world could dislike the portuguese . 
  yugogermania, 
  bombing riad , no way that could have any negative side effects / s. 
  seriously , starting wars is n't going to help anyone . 
  but what would be the point ? 
  maybe declare it an independent nation , start eu membership talks and see what happens ? 
  might be an interesting experiment . 
  what do you mean ? 
  is there a three meter diamond under the tower of london ?

  well , holy roman empire of the german nation . 
  figuring out what germany is , who and what belongs to germany is the central theme of german history . 
  true , but the video is still interesting . 
  it 's not like the `` did a tyrannosaurus rex steer noah 's ark to the south pole '' - type headlines . 
  those are completely reasonable discussions : the brexiteer fascists had to get out of the eussr , before it could an army that will be used to stop any other countries from leaving by force , after which there will only be germany and provinces of germany left . 
  makes sense to me . 
  imagine it 's judgment day and nobody came . 
  your user name is very relevant . 
  yes , i misread it as ` if i 'm talking ** to ** my dad in german ' which of course is completely different . 
  still , i find the discussion in / r/de interesting . 
  [ i did a little survey ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/5hw25w/wie_sprecht_ihr_eure_eltern_an/ ) in / r/de . 
  opinions are divided , but some do use mama and papa as adults . 
  * edit * misread the actual claim of op . 
  i shall be adequately shamed for it . 
  i 've had a look at the paper before , and i agree that they are definitely measuring * something * . 
  but the effect is tiny , and measuring tiny effects is hard . 
  there are so many things that produce tiny effects , which are easily forgotten . 
  things like thermal expansion , leaking microwaves , crosstalk between power cables , leftover gas in the vacuum chamber interacting with thermal radiation , magnetic effects from alternating currents , acoustic vibrations and whatnot . 
  they are working to exclude all sources of this kind of course , but nobody is perfect . 
  on the other hand , if it really works as advertised , it breaks an awful lot of very well established physics . 
  which is of course perfectly possible , and i would love that to be true . 
  it would open up so many possibilities . 
  but this is precisely why we need to be extremely careful not to be too fast to accept it . 
  so what we need is testing it as thoroughly as possible and stay skeptical until we have indisputable evidence . 
  and given all that , my money is still on experimental error . 
  by the way , what i really do n't like is how the inventor is acting like it 's definitely proven and will solve this and that problem . 
  in it 's current state it 's worse than an ion engine on a space craft , and he has no way of knowing whether it can be improved to be of any practical use . 
  i bet you 10 $ that it is . 
  it seems to me they just have to be against it for ideological reasons , aka `` atoms are evil !, 
  the green party wants to kill it , because apparently it 's `` too expensive '' and `` wo n't be ready in time '' . 
  for me that 's reason enough not to vote for them . 
  i was hoping to use [ this one ] ( http://esperanto.lodestone.org/bildoj/afisxo-1937.jpg ) at some point , but that needs specific circumstances . 
  exactly , they should just speak proper german , problem solved . 
  more realistic than the rest of star trek . 
  never understood the fixation on flying cars . 
  they are the least practical futuretech . 
  i like it , shows how connected our myths and via them we are . 
  but the scary thing is , if charlemagne and his equivalents did n't show up during ww2 , does that mean that * was n't * europes hour of greatest danger yet ?

  but there are already the moon nazis there , that would get horribly confusing !, 
  fidel castro is dead !, 
  edit : seriously , that was one of his tweets . 
  panini . 
  looks very cool !, 
  but they could not resist to do the kickstarter intro of `` all of human history has led to this point , the one thing the human spirit yearns for above all else in this universe but had to wait and suffer so long for : this usb coffee warmer . 
  i think the point is `` gr\u00fc\u00df gott '' only works in bavaria , austria , etc. 
  as a formal greeting . 
  i would not hesitate to use it on the bavarian minister president , for example . 
  you prussian fishheads up there are just jealous of our border-crossing spirit . 
   servus i 'm always amazed how widespread servus is . 
  i used to think it 's only a southern german thing .

  as i understand it , there have been some programs to develop crewed vehicles , but they have always been scrapped . 
  i guess the soyuz are good enough for the iss , and crewed spaceflight is n't really that important . 
  my rule is : if it can be said as a word , say it as a word . 
  like nasa or cern . 
  far more honest than the original intro . 
  [ with the most mighty of militaries ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75zmij_4lfq ), 
  they might as well just call it * alpia * . 
  sounds like chocolate . 
  i 've heard it as `` the franconians are the kurds of bavaria '' . 
  by at least an order of magnitude less . 
  it 's like , what do you think of if i say pisa ? 
  there was its only fatal accident in 1999 , but it 's going again . 
  it 's pretty cool , and about the only thing wuppertal is known for . 
  also you might get slightly seasick in it .
