  i believe my pig is whistling !, 
  they mistranslated the german one , jemandem eine b\u00e4ren aufbinden . 
  it really means : to make someone believe a ( possibly funny and actually unbelievable ) falsehood . 
  there are no progressive tenses in german . 
  well , you can technically use them , but you sound like a wanker . 
  it 's the least pretentious one , and the only one that makes me think : you know , maybe it would be a good idea . 
  i 'm surprised switzerland has 100 % german . 
  when i was asking for directions in geneva , nobody seemed to understand german . 
  or english . 
  working language in french guyana probably . 
  if you watch until the end , the commentary is in english . 
  my god , that 's criminal . 
  i 'm always amazed by the high population density in northern italy . 
  although i think i know your answer . 
  a forced external division , why should one keep clinging to it ? 
  [ average european ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/albrecht_d%c3%bcrer_-_emperor_charlemagne.jpg ), 
  that 's not the problem . 
  but `` eastern '' would associate bavaria with eastern germany , especially ~ ~ gomorrah ~ ~ berlin , and that ca n't happen . 
  they still make cds ? 
  the only reasonable way to spell it is `` kaller '' , obviously . 
  the dragon was needed in westeros . 
  part of the reason is the introduction of [ delay-action bombs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delay-action_bomb ) which purposely do n't explode on impact but at a random later time or when somebody tries to disarm or handle them . 
  is n't war nice . 
  i have to disagree that it changes the results . 
  `` under the hood '' all you 're doing when integrating is calculating ( infinite ) sums of ( infinitely small ) changes . 
  everything else is just fancy notation so you do n't have to be so verbose . 
  if you allow me enough wiggle room to interpret `` change '' as instantaneous infinitesimal change , and `` summing up '' as a limit on an infinite sum , my `` definition '' holds ( for lebesgue integrals ) . 
  my point is , understanding integrals that way will get you through school . 
  if you sum up all the change plus what you had in the beginning , you have everything . 
  congratulations , you now understand integration . 
  if you sum up all the change plus what you had in the beginning , you have everything . 
  congratulations , you now understand integration . 
  [ zone rouge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zone_rouge ) `` completely devastated .

  together, 
  and the last name of mira furlan , actress in babylon 5 . 
  just fyi , `` all but '' means `` almost '' or `` very nearly '' . 
  english is weird . 
  eu psi op to make you join, 
  but he was macedonian , not greek !, 
  stop appropriating the history of your neighbouring countries !, 
  pyramids , monoliths , obelisks , stonehenges , and the like , , you can never have enough of them . 
  asterix , lucky luke and tintin are great , but apparently not very well known outside of europe . 
  we should invest heavily in anti-dragon weaponry if we want to stand a chance . 
  distinction without a difference . 
  you could make a great spy movie about the polish enigma code breakers . 
  deaths by illegal drugs ; if we take the number from the german statistical office [ here ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20100107033510/http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/sites/destatis/internet/de/presse/pm/zdw/2007/pd07__013__p002.psml ) for 2005 of over 16000 direct deaths from alcohol , we get a rate ten times higher for alcohol than for illegal drugs . 
  and i dare to guess the situation is similar in other european countries . 
  is it just me , or does she look like a vampire ? 
  such a juncker , any one of you . 
  and with two t , otherwise you would have a long \u00f6 instead of a short \u00f6 . 
  i in the south would never call it konfit\u00fcre , maybe the prussians or fishheads do .

  a strongly worded letter to the european cyclists ' federation, 
  i love that after the war , messerschmitt cut of the wings of their planes , put on some wheels and sold them as [ kabinenroller ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/messerschmitt_tg500_01.jpg/800px-messerschmitt_tg500_01.jpg ) . 
  i was surprised when i learned the us did it the other way , but of course it makes sense for a country newly created from immigrants . 
  whether a rolling r is harder or easier is really a matter of perspective . 
  i personally find the english r much harder . 
  if your german , no problem . 
  if you want something really hard for non-germans , try `` tschechisches streichholzsch\u00e4chtelchen '' ( czech [ diminutive ] match box ) . 
  no , but have you checked out the [ latest krupp innovations ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mwtfi/thyssenkrupp_unveils_the_worlds_first/ ) , ~ ~ we 're ~ ~ they 're a great company !,

  yes . 
  it goes slowly over a small bridge , and then has to leave again backwards . 
  and on the top right you can see the train station , that takes up a big chunk of the island . 
  i 'm surprised they still have n't fixed that idiotic setup . 
  i never understood why we got that stereotype . 
  it has come to this , i see . 
  fun fact , the german word for peninsula is halbinsel , lit . 
  half island . 
  and peninsula itself in latin means something like almost island . 
  too hot . 
  so many germans , swamp germans , mountain germans , rich mountain germans , sea germans , fjord germans , ikea germans , ... 
  my home region is called franconia ( ger . 
  franken ) , so i 'll take credit , too . 
  god-empress merkel confirmed . 
  luckily with global warming , the sahara is coming to you now !, 
  and they hate standard interfaces and connectors , i always see the apple users using tons of adapters . 
  the uk gave us peter higgs , whose particle discovery was celebrate today . 
  happy higgs day everybody !, 
  how could you !, 
  well , like a cross between john oliver and hollande . 
  yeah , it does look like their balance of power doctrine is still rooted deep . 
  i 'm always saddened by this kind of talk . 
  the french are supposed to be * our * best frenemies , we even made up a much cooler word for it , erbfeind , lit . 
  hereditary enemy .

  `` monsieur macron , monsieur macron , the british changed their mind , they want to stay ! '', 
  `` too late , we already changed the textbook , there is no way back now . '', 
  but who is that macron looking man next to merkel ? 
  you will be even more surprised that they are in fact a lake , not an island , 
  not to be confused with [ mainau ] ( http://www.badische-seiten.de/bilder/insel-mainau/ ) , the flower island in lake constance . 
  pretty much everything on that island besides a small palace are various kinds of gardens .
