  very pretty . 
  funny , we have the same legend about friedrich ii . 
  berlin flag ? 
  over my dead body . 
  how much is that in attoparsec ? 
  i did not . 
  but the sky is n't the color of television , tuned to a dead channel . 
  good point , but that does n't make greenpeace 's behavior in this issue more acceptable . 
  it was pretty infuriating when they [ damaged nazca lines ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt ) in one of their stunts . 
  you jest , but if i had space to put it , i would have bought this apollo set that is all the rage these days . 
  finally my years of latin classes will pay off !, 
  if only i could remember a thing . 
  i vote for european federation . 
  me fail english ? 
  that 's unpossible . 
  best looking one so far . 
  of all the things about franconia , our ( inofficial ) hymn is the worst . 
  why do eagles in flags always show so much tongue ? 
  literally worse than boris johnson . 
  e\u016dropen ingli\u0161 will bi bjutiful !, 
  step won : remov ze unprona\u016dncibl th-sa\u016dnd . 
  step tu : massiv spelling reform . 
  not denying any of that , just trying to stir up dust . 
  if i were that guy , i would point out that in under two years english will no longer be an official eu language . 
   direct descendant of prussia worst insult imaginable, 
  i thought that is only for french citizens ? 
  but he will probably get a bust in [ walhalla ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/walhalla memorial ) . 
  a life without snowy winters would n't be worth living . 
  that song always seemed so apocalyptic to me . 
  or hypergreece . 
  germany 's greatest shame . 
  ever . 
  i actually laughed once in 2003 . 
  it 's a shame i will have to take to my grave . 
  surprise president charles mansion !, 
  they tried , there was despicable propaganda against it , it failed . 
  the best kind of correct . 
  i 'm a member of the rolling-r society . 
  subtitles are a must . 
  ii do n't care they 're bastards , erik the red 's blood runs through their veins !, 
  and it 's not even a good song . 
  hey , german tanks are superior to us tanks !, 
  globalization . 
  i would n't even care if they rounded up every time . 
  hell , collect the rounded up cents and give them to charity and people will feel good about that . 
  one of our chancellors ( helmut schmidt ) said something like `` if you have visions , go to a doctor . '', 
  i envy them , it 's 30 degrees here , can hardly move . 
  i just ca n't listen to the way he speaks . 
  somebody once told me it 's almost as if french was designed to be hard for the germans , and german hard for the french . 
  and at least for me trying to learn french was like digging through a concrete wall with a wooden spoon . 
  i 'm in . 
  i 'm looking forward to * not * owning an electric vehicle , but to be able to call a self-driving one on demand . 
  so far the eu managed without any atrocities , that makes it pretty great . 
  i have to ask , is this a culture meme ? 
  i just realized he tells you absolutely everything you need to know in this monologe . 
  i have no way of knowing whether you are bullshitting or not . 
  no , we 'll give that to pence after trump is impeached for not being trump . 
  i 'm sure we can find an `` expert '' who will confirm german is a very western slavic dialect . 
  somebody should make pan pan slavic !, 
  or we put the buildings on something [ like that ] ( http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/space+shuttle+discovery+moves+launch+pad+8wvlqhqouujl.jpg ) and slowly drive around the eu . 
  i thought you were joking , but  scottish banknotes are unusual , firstly because they are issued by retail banks , not central banks , and secondly , as they are technically not legal tender anywhere in the united kingdom -- not even in scotland . 
  the street needs fixing . 
  `` i 'll take all of you with us ! '', 
  seems like a very bad strategy . 
  go in a hooligan pub with him , get him drunk and instigate a riot . 
  ah come on , australia is pretty european , culturally . 
  i thought english nationalists do n't consider themselves part of europe . 
   what do you think of that ? 
    sch\u00e4uble : a lot i think they translated the german idiom too literal here . 
  in hamburg there is the miniaturwunderland , model trains and model landscapes . 
  one exhibition is of the city of hamburg , including the building it 's in . 
  if you look inside its window , you can see the exhibition , including the building the building is in . 
  [ try polish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8nvpe_gfzq ), 
  the german text uses the word `` spinner '' , which [ this dictionary for example ] ( http://dict.leo.org/german-english/spinner ) translates as wacko , crackpot , madcap , nutcase , nutjob , crank , goofball , nutter , oddball , screwball , weirdo , kook , fruitcake or sicko . 
  without the original , i do n't know what word farage used himself . 
  i tried to fix the worst mistakes . 
  if the zeit publishes the original , i will post it . 
  i invite you to check the original in german version , the google translate version or have the translation checked by someone else . 
  sadly no english version . 
  [ google translated ] ( https://translate.google.de/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zeit.de%2fpolitik%2fausland%2f2017-05%2fnigel-farage-brexit-ukip-russland-kontakte%2fkomplettansicht&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) choice quotes ( adapted from google translate by me )  zeit online : the economy of great britain and the economy of the rest of the eu are weakened by the brexit . 
   farage : you are talking trash . 
  the eu is a failed project . 
  the idea that it is good for the economy is just as much rubbish . 
   zeit online : a russian foreign policy objective is the division and weakening of the eu . 
  were you in the case of the brexite used directly or indirectly for russian targets ? 
  farage : it is obvious that the eu wants to expand eastwards and threaten russia . 
  the eu is so insane . 
   zeit online : why did you meet with him [ deputy russian ambassador ] ? 
  farage : i think you are a notjob !, 
  you are a real nutjob !, 
  the brexit was the best thing that happened - for russia , for america and for germany . 
  that is what this is about . 
   zeit online : the brexit could create a new frontier in europe . 
  farage : you live in a fairytale world . 
  you must be crazy . 
  i 've never heard anything stupid . 
  because of the brexit i should not be able to travel to hamburg ? 
  you should appear in a comedyshow . 
  if there 's still an eu by then , you 'll be back in a generation . 
  they shall learn our peaceful ways , * by force * !,
