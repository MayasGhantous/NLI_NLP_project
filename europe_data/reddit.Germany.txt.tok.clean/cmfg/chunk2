  somebody who knows electronics * might * be able to repair it though . 
  nobody here would see an internal genocide or something similar in another country as reason enough ? 
  i see the arguments not to get involved in other countries internal matters , and that an actual case would be muddled and complex , but should there not be a point where military intervention is justified ? 
  germany is mordor , right ? 
  you admit it !, 
  dutch is like a drunk reading what a semi-illiterate child wrote down . 
  is it actually used on government forms and such ? 
  peru , just for the confusion . 
  tshiken , shef \u00e4nd lo\u03c7 , obviously . 
  what changed more then the spelling are the fonts ; a hundred years ago we had [ kurrent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurrent ) and [ s\u00fctterlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%bctterlin ) for handwriting , and [ fraktur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fraktur ) for printed text . 
  fraktur i can read with a bit of difficulty , but s\u00fctterlin and especially kurrent might as well be klingon . 
  i 'm unreasonably happy that estonian also uses \u00e4 . 
   fiat multipla so the `` please kill me '' car abomination has a name . 
  she 's a liar , liar ... 
  well , i ca n't navigate spaceships faster than light yet . 
  you can never go wrong with the most german name , herrmann . 
  fuck , i just now get the joke . 
  and you can call me bigoted as much as you want , there is no human right to eu membership . 
  and just so you know , i 'm no sockpuppet , and do n't know the other guy . 
  sorry to break your dreams , but hell will freeze over before germany lets turkey in . 
  i was so distracted i walked into a pole and hurt my lip , damn . 
  it 's finally time for esperanto !, 
  i like to think of the experimental fusion reactor [ wendelstein 7-x ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wendelstein_7-x#/media/file:wendelstein7-x_torushall-2011.jpg ) instead . 
  why ? 
  i think the swiss are also using an inverted scale . 
  i do n't know the linguistics for a good answer , i can just tell you as a native speaker you pick up on variations of the r immediately , especially because it 's one of the north-south markers ( in the south , the r often rolled ) . 
  beginners tend to pronounce words like they were english , ignore the difference between u and \u00fc . 
  also most never get the r or ch right . 
  fun fact , esperanto took that word as `` pi\u0109o '' . 
  and slovonia . 
  can we get the german speaking part ? 
  saved northern germany from civilization . 
  after that he should be made president , he clearly knows what he is doing .

  [ blue banana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) . 
  tldr : region with lots of people and stuff . 
  [ actual footage ] ( https://youtu.be/nifdpfoy1fq?t=35 ), 
  i always wanted to ask you , are you schwert-ritter or schwer-tritter ? 
  ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ plans ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ bottom ^ ^ ^ drawer . 
  what are the symptoms of acting german ? 
  i get a little annoyed when they mispronounce ie and ei in german words . 
  ei , like in the various - stein last names sounds like ay , not ee !, 
  and the ie in wiener schnitzel is ee , not ay !, 
  those actually make sense , as much as anything in the english language can make sense . 
  i should move north . 
  fun fact , the seventh-day adventists insist on saturday as the seventh day so much , they are named after it . 
  in their view , sunday = 7 is an evil plot of the antichrist ( = catholic church ) . 
  the first time i used a system with the wrong localization , i thought the calendar app had a bug . 
  not really , the cities reasonably reflect their region . 
  only berlin is `` special '' . 
  the sleeping king under the mountain is a very common motif . 
  fanta4 are funny when you 're twelve , but all the rest is just trash . 
  are eastern european or southern european better ? 
  even if you achieve all of this and russia becomes a nice and friendly neighbor , i strongly suspect poland and other countries from ee would veto any kind of russian membership . 
  skill [ `` python '' ] = language.level.native, 
  the fishheads in the north tend to be blonder , but they 're basically skandinavian . 
  reminds one a bit of frogs , does n't it . 
  and charlemagne sheds a silent tear of joy . 
  yes . 
  did ireland ever have its own empire ? 
  most european countries had their shot , so maybe we can rebrand the eu for a while . 
  [ we had that , too . 
  i only do postal voting anymore , it 's just so much more convenient . 
  well , the eeeestis buy their milk in bags , so there is that . 
  written and spoken french feel like separate languages . 
  i can figure out some written french over english , latin and some failed tries to learn it . 
  but the french then insist on mumbling only half the letters through their nose and ignore the rest , making it completely incomprehensible . 
  my four favorite words !, 
  luxembourgish sounds so funny , like a swabian who uses excessively many french loan words . 
  even the catholics could n't do that here . 
  there is always the choice of a non-religious alternative class , called ethics or philosophy or something similar ( details depend on which federal state ) . 
  most people do n't switch due to social inertia and because the alternative classes are usually badly scheduled , but if it became that annoying , they would . 
  well , history and teachings of your own ( in germany religion classes are held by representatives of the religions , who have had special training ) and the major world religions . 
  and since religion influences a lot of people on this planet , it is useful to know some basics . 
  but of course you could put that stuff in history classes or something . 
  you might say the nether lands . 
  what country are you in now ? 
  but how do you pronounce it ? 
  ( heaven , lord god , sacrament ! ), 
  is also used similarly . 
  well , there is this absolutely legit and totally not childish naming problem of your republic . 
  not going to happen . 
  did you know there was the [ superconducting super collider ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superconducting_super_collider ) project in texas , bigger and higher energy than the lhc ? 
  they even started construction , but it was abandoned for money reasons . 
  for now , an upgraded lhc will stay the flagship . 
  if there would be a bigger machine , it would almost certainly be again at cern , with the lhc as a pre-accelerator . 
  but that would be huge ( like 100km tunnel ) and expensive . 
  what will probably happen instead is going away from hadron colliders and back to linear electron-positron colliders with lower energy , but much more precision , like the [ ilc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_linear_collider ) , which will probably be built in japan . 
  china is trying to get in on the game , so it 's possible they shell out for a chinese collider , but they will have a harder time attracting the experts . 
  breadwar !!, 
  german bread and brezen , that 's what most germans abroad complain about missing most . 
  [ schafkopf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schafkopf ) , at least here in bavaria . 
  four players , 32 cards . 
  in the beginning of each game you figure out in which `` mode '' you play , which influences whether 2 vs 2 or 1 vs 3 , and which cards are trump or not . 
  team with the most points wins . 
  legally not gambling , so you can play for money . 
  i was fully expecting this question to be about the culture . 
  almost certainly it was n't cranberry , but * preiselbeere * , english lingonberry , partridgeberry , or cowberry . 
  the vitruvian man on italy 's [ 1 $ coin ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/common/shared/img/it/1e.gif ) is very classy .
