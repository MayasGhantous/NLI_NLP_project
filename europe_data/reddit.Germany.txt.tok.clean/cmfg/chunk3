  like a symbol for civilization . 
  i mean , if we strg-f ` ed through all german history class books , lithuania would probably show up a handful of times . 
  but fuck if i remember anything , actually about the whole baltics . 
  i like how the bot changed the language from french to english . 
  i would have thought [ his bunny ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/albrecht_d%c3%bcrer_-_hare%2c_1502_-_google_art_project.jpg/1024px-albrecht_d%c3%bcrer_-_hare%2c_1502_-_google_art_project.jpg ) . 
  but then you fundamentally misunderstand us . 
  the eu did not erase or replace the history of its members , it 's a continuation . 
  the eu is not tabula rasa that fell from the sky . 
  the history of european countries has always been intertwined in countless wars and shifting alliances , and now it has taken a new form , but it is still one unbroken story . 
  sarkozy offered merkel [ damn she has been chancellor since forever ] input into the decision process of the `` force de frappe '' . 
  merkel declined . 
  wow , i would n't have expected it to be * that * cheap . 
  but then again : [ random point ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/jakutsk,+sacha,+russland/@62.0621224,129.7457567,3a,75y,296.84h,82.05t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1shyjd7jtj51ds-c0g0asg5q!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dhyjd7jtj51ds-c0g0asg5q%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d1.5000076%26pitch%3d-3%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x5bf63939a0d2c47d:0x69b4c4b35cafa2fb!8m2!3d62.0354523!4d129.6754745!6m1!1e1 ) at streetview . 
   the contract includes only the tuition fee ( the fee depending on the program and speciality that you have chosen ) . 
  the contract does not include any accommodation fee , medical insurance , or registration fee . 
  the student must pay all fees related to the contract , accommodation , registration and medical insurance no later than 3 days after arrival . 
  so the $ 1050 are only for the course itself . 
  you should find out what living costs in yakutsk are like . 
  do n't look at me , it 's those prussians again !, 
  well , there has been bad history between pretty much any place on earth and europe , including everywhere in europe . 
  so that alone should not stop you . 
  may i ask which region we are talking about ? 
  i saw that documentary !, 
  while we 're at most definitely not cheating , my favorite word , the greeting * [ servus ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/servus ) * , works in ( south ) german , czech , romanian , serbo-croatian and slovak according to wikipedia . 
  hallo !, 
  means hello !, 
  in german , dutch and norwegian . 
  and it 's totally a complete sentence . 
  or qatar !, 
  heaven : the policeman is icelandic , the lover is french , the cook is italian , the engineer is german and it is all organized by the swiss . 
  hell : the policeman is turkish , the lover is british , the cook is british , the engineer is british and it is all organized by the greek . 
  in addition to what others have said , you need a unanimous decision of the eu council to start negotiations . 
  and i doubt very much you could get poland and other former eastern block countries to agree . 
  i do n't think that was ever explicitly taught . 
  but i doubt the indigo . 
  you seem to dismiss `` expanding the mind '' outright . 
  but then you would never read a book , watch tv , have discussions or learn or do anything new that is n't strictly needed to survive . 
  it sounds cliche , but you only understand yourself if you learn about others in much the same way we study mars to understand earth . 
   in short , the soviets won the race , and then the us moved the finish line to avoid political embarrassment . 
  a nice way of putting it . 
  well , bavaria tends to be more conservative , and with a bit of imagination you can equate the stereotypes of bavarian farmers and texan cowboys . 
  also there is notion ( that is completely blown out of proportion by non-bavarians ) of bavaria being somewhat special/apart from the rest of germany . 
  russian dashcam videos are the best , you never know what you 'll see . 
  maybe a truck falling over ? 
  a mig flying dangerously low ? 
  like a box of chocolates . 
  reminds me of the simpsons episode with the german tourists  problem number 35 with america , no universal health care . 
   number 36 , no metric system . 
  and i was hoping there was no more reason for a war against france . 
  while we are at it , let 's get south tyrol , too . 
  problem is , history has shown by now that a voting system like yours will inevitably lead to a two-part system . 
  and ask the british how easy it is to change such an entrenched system . 
  spoiler : very very hard . 
   j\u00e4nner \u00d6si confirmed . 
  fucking hell are those ads disgusting . 
  munich seems to have streets and squares named after a lot of european capitals . 
  amsterdam , athens , belgrade , berlin , bern , brussels , budapest , bucharest ( not anymore ) , paris , london , prague , warsaw , vienna , . . no andorra , ankara , bratislava , moscow , madrid , ... 
  i stopped looking , but there are a lot . 
  i 've seen it plastered all over reddit , and there even was a segment on heute journal about it . 
  they have the best rhapsody , after all . 
  i think russia sees bombing isis more as target practice than allying with anybody . 
  in german that is a mistake that some find so horrible , that they invented [ a word for it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plenken ) . 
  i thought we had something special there , france !, 
  how could you !, 
  we do have a party that 's pretty close to a religious right in the us-sense : the pbc , partei bibeltreuer christen ( party of bible-adhering christians ) . 
  it 's one of the 30 parties in the last federal election and got 18542 , ( 0.0 % ) of votes . 
  what about arminius/hermann the cherusker ? 
  probably too obscure by now . 
  currently approaching light speed rotating in his grave . 
  can we keep austria and rather switch switzerland for croatia ? 
  i 'm a big fan of the hungarian film [ kontroll ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfhesbsfjxk ) , a weird atmospheric action comedy in the budapest subway system is the best way i can describe it . 
  if you want to see something cool and different , watch it . 
  i do n't follow , how does border controls make smuggling easier ? 
  how so ? 
  most of the time i heard it on german media , it sounded a lot like they almost used airquotes . 
  esperanto would be neat , but let me tell you one thing : if this sub is any indication , people really dislike esperanto as a eu second language . 
  i 've tried to argue for it , believe me . 
  pity , if you ask me , it 's so much quicker to learn . 
  it was quite entertaining when die partei used their spots as adspace for hlx . 
  do n't be so hard on him , it 's not his fault he is from czechoslovakia . 
  good old modal particles . 
  my favorite is `` fei '' . 
  to quote wikipedia : `` it denotes that the speaker states something important that might be a surprise for the listener . 
  to give an adequate translation even into standard german is difficult ; probably , the best try is to use understatements with strong affirmative meaning . 
  in english , translations to `` i should think '' or `` just to mention '' seem possible , varying from context . '', 
  in german sex and the number sechs are written differently , but are pronounced almost or completely the same . 
  that image must be 500 years old .

  the bavarian constitution guarantees `` the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors , in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows , the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruit to the extent customary in the respective region '' .
