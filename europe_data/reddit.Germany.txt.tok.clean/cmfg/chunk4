  i would do it for esperanto , but it 's so easy there are no problems . 
  i tried and failed learning french . 
  the thousands of verb endings , but so many are pronounced the same . 
  pronunciation in general is hard with all the nasal sounds and silent letters , and the feeling my tongue and jaw might break from trying to say something . 
  the mumblyness ? 
  of the language . 
  no offence taken , it is a tiny bit more complicated than it realistically has to be . 
  do n't let that keep you from posting , they were almost certainly just trying to help you by correcting your mistakes . 
  nope . 
  after a form of sein you do n't decline adjectives , not by gender nor singular/plural . 
  i 'm glad i do n't have to learn that . 
  fun fact , in some dialects they are also known as erdbirne ( earth-pear ) or grundbirne ( ground-pear ) . 
  south german r = best r. 
  capitalization is still important . 
  if you do n't use it , your writing looks like a text message from a 13 year old .

  if i could , i would go cardless . 
  i kind of like this planet , can we please keep it around , or even better fix it ? 
  and the thing is , if humanity would colonize another planet , all our problems would follow us there . 
  intolerance , superstition , hate and violence will not magically disappear just because we are somewhere else . 
  right , he was n't appointed to dictator . 
  there are still the often mentioned checks and balances . 
  he can do damage , but he will be stopped before he can do something * really * stupid . 
  maybe the whole thing will end up as a wake up call to fix the stupid american voting system . 
  `` todays youth would n't even know which direction to go when it 's time to invade poland . '', 
   space is big . 
  really big . 
  you just wo n't believe how vastly , hugely , mind-bogglingly big it is . 
  i mean , you may think it 's a long way down the road to the chemist , but that 's just peanuts to space . 
  seriously . 
  the universe is just gigantic with an absurd number of stars . 
  have a look at the [ hubble ultra-deep field ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hubble_ultra-deep_field ) . 
  what you see there are whole galaxies scattered around like sand on a beach . 
  and we know life is not impossible , as we are here . 
  so by pure numbers alone we can be virtually certain there is life out there * somewhere * . 
  but of course , that life might be so far away from us , that it might as well not exist . 
  i can support the luc\u00eda-hypothesis . 
  the culture is the best utopia i 've seen so far . 
  if there was a culture party , i 'd vote for it . 
  japan ? 
  having an umlaut in your name is a real pain internationally . 
  since the eu is the greater german empire , no humor is allowed . 
  sadly , there are some sounds in english that are n't in german at all , so this would n't really work , like the th and the j in join . 
  and lots of others have more or less different sounds , like the r. 
  you could use our spelling , does n't that look beautiful ( th only very approximate ) : ei fink inglisch is in nied tu a gud spring klien . 
  [ i 'll never tire of this poem ] ( http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html ) . 
  if you have n't studied at oxford , you 'll probably fail to pronounce it all correctly . 
  edit : posted wrong link like an idiot . 
  so at the risk of sounding like a salesman : do n't fear - there are excellent courses on duolingo in [ english ] ( https://www.duolingo.com/course/eo/en/learn-esperanto-online ) and [ spanish ] ( https://www.duolingo.com/course/eo/es/learn-esperanto-online ) , and in lots of languages on [lernu.net ] ( http://lernu.net ) - for free !, 
  also there is probably an esperanto club in your city . 
  that 's already a problem : many eu websites and programs are only available in the big three languages ( en , fr , de ) , and if you only speak one of the smaller languages , you 're screwed . 
  a lingua franca for the eu absolutely should not be limited to the eu institutions , you are absolutely right about transparency . 
  ideally , you would teach it schools everywhere in the eu as a second language . 
  which means it must be easy to learn , so you do n't overstress the students with the additional work . 
  which means it can not be a national language , because those take years of effort . 
  well , the reason english is dominating right now has little to to with the uk , and very very little with malta or ireland , and much more with a big country to the west . 
  please please not latin . 
  it might be `` very easy to write and speak '' if you speak italian , but for me and many other people it was extremely hard to learn . 
  and we did n't even learn it to be fluid , just to translate some texts . 
  but i like the lingua franca idea very much . 
  but it should be with an easier language . 
  there are some projects like interlingua or the big one , esperanto ( of which i am a proponent ) . 
  but it does n't matter too much exactly which one , as long as it is an easy to learn yet `` complete '' language , that 's at least somewhat culturally neutral . 
  i 'd say , a match made in heaven . 
  designated hipster dump . 
  it 's true , the moon does n't exist , i 've heard that on a youtube video , so it must be true . 
  bielefeld , just to cause a resonance cascade of conspiracy theories . 
  the thing i like about san escobar is its low crime rate , especially for the region . 
  in fact , i 've never even heard of anyone getting pick-pocketed and the like there . 
  they say it 's also nice in the winter , so i 'll look into it more later . 
  the flights are a bit expensive though , and for some reason you have to fly via warsaw . 
  i was content with the packstation ( [ this thing ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/packstation ) located on strategic points ( although not all deliviery companies can use that ) ) , but that is even better . 
  i 'll have what the mountain man said . 
  climate change mixed with religious and political extremism destabilizing more and more parts of the world , leading to civil wars , failed states , refugees , mass migration etc. 
  let 's wait and see when article 50 gets triggered , and what the final deal will be . 
  to be fair , a big argument in the last independence referendum was that leaving the uk might lead to scotland being out of the eu , something the majority of scots do n't want ( as the eu referendum showed ) . 
  so one can argue the situation has changed significantly , enough to justify a new independence referendum . 
  no , just [ strange music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_1-oylphjs ), 
  something like : people in various us governmental bodies need to know up to date basic information on foreign countries for their work , and it should be reliable . 
  the cia collects information on all countries in the world . 
  so they copy the intro page of each dossier ( without anything sensitive ) into a booklet . 
  might as well publish it . 
  oops , but it could have been far worse . 
  the [ cia world fact book ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ ) is pretty good on basic information like that . 
  edit : fixed wrong link, 
  as a real pappenheimer myself ( yes , [ it 's a real town ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pappenheim ) ) , you are correct in your usage . 
  it does mean something like `` i know ( the strengths and weaknesses of ) my guys '' . 
  comes from a drama by schiller about wallenstein , who says it implying he knows the loyalty of the regiment of field marshal gottfried heinrich graf zu pappenheim during the thirty years war . 
  dutch = swamp german confirmed . 
  you guys should ask finland for some tips and tricks . 
  maybe half a century could be enough time . 
  but you 're certainly right , it would n't work today or in the near future . 
  still i think closer links to a future democratic russia up to and including eu membership would be beneficial to all sides . 
  it 's just that at the moment russia is far from fulfilling the prerequisites for membership . 
  there is the joke about the eastern front , that in the red army the first row of infantry got a gun each , the second row a replacement magazine each , and all the rows behind them were told to pick up what the guys in front of you dropped after they got shot . 
  wow , i 've never heard about that .
