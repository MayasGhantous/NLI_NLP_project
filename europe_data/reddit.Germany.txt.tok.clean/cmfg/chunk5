  hell , southern germany is closer to austria than northern germany . 
  but the larger point is , there is no way to cut europe into clearly defined cultural blocks . 
   bundes please allow me a bit of pedantry . 
  bund in this context means federation . 
  the federal republic of germany ( bundesrepublik deutschland ) consists of federal states ( bundesl\u00e4nder ( short l\u00e4nder ) , sing . 
  fun fact : after ww2 , lots of things got renamed from imperial ( reichs - ) to federal ( bundes - ) . 
  except the bundestag ( the federal parliament ) is sitting in the reichstag ( building ) .

   cumskins i 'm really curious about your thinking here . 
  you thought you would further your cause of fighting racism against asian people by going to a subreddit full of europeans , the wast majority of which are white , and throw around a derogatory term for white people .

  if you count in binary with your fingers , their position is the direct binary representation . 
  there are two massive points you are missing : firstly , yes , base 12 would be a bit better than base 10 . 
  but what is really powerful is that your measuring system is based on the same base as your numbering system . 
  si has base 10 for units , and we all use base 10 numbers . 
  it fits and gives you sooo many advantages . 
  imperial uses base 12 ( sometimes , inconsistently ) but we do n't count in base 12 . 
  only then would it give you the benefits . 
  second point : yes , you can measure , say , length , area and volume in any system and get a rough idea how much each is by eye . 
  but what si gives you , is consistency between units . 
  going from meters to square meters to cubic meters or liters is trivially easy .

  seriously , latin was my first foreign language in 5th grade , in a * gymnasium * in bavaria . 
  it 's still offered in some schools . 
  they sell it as a good way to get into romance languages . 
  also it 's supposed to help your grammatical understand and analytical thinking , to be even similar to math in some way ( very debatable , but i bought it at the time ) . 
  it does help actually understanding the grammar of european languages with all the cases , conjugations , declinations and word genders . 
  oh and my elementary school never did any foreign languages . 
  native german , had latin in school then english . 
  most people in my school had french instead of latin , and there were additional options for spanish and italian . 
  ancient greek had been canceled a few years earlier . 
  later i tried french by myself , but failed , then tried esperanto and succeeded .

  what annoys me : this is the first time they do these primaries , but they chose to use a stupid voting system that makes this kind of strategic voting necessary with predictably bad results .
