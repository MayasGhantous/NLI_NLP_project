  the american categorization into `` white '' and `` non-white '' does n't make too much sense . 
  it works as long as you have two pretty distinctly looking groups , i.e. 
  northern europeans and subsaharan africans . 
  but trying to put the whole continuum of ethnicities in the world into those two boxes is just arbitrary . 
  finnish is so cute . 
  we scarified berlin as a hipster-trap , so the rest of germany could live in peace . 
  a nice overview in [ this youtube video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrkrgkgeww4 ) . 
  and [ some ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teyvcs2s4mi ) more [ details ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvmj8ddx9yy ), 
  recently i was at a pub quiz where i was the only one to get this question right : who elects the british prime minister ? 
  answer : the queen for some bizarre reason . 
  i was just thinking that dutch sounds like what english speakers say when they try to sound german . 
  coca cola . 
  `` why do i even bother with humanity ... '', 
  most of them have cousins in german : schweigen : the opposite of talking wehen : the blowing of the wind \u00dcbersichtlich : lit . 
  ` oversightly ' . 
  something that 's clear and comprehensive , but those two do n't really cover it fu\u00dfbad : putting only your feet in the water gl\u00fccklich ( ? 
  ) : the end-state of being happy wohl : opposite of not g\u00f6nnen : to be very happy for somebody who has [ done/achieved ] something i ca n't find an equivalent for gezin ( except kernfamilie , `` core family '' ) and dauwtrappen , although dauw = tau = dew , and there is the old word trappen also in german , so you could literally translate it as tautrappen . 
  would not have any connotations , though . 
  romans did . 
  ok , this one i have do defend ; it just makes sense : it continues the pattern . 
  if you accept 8:30 as halb neun ( `` the ninth hour has half passed '' ) as is standard german , then of course 8:15 is viertel neun , and 8:45 is dreiviertel neun . 
  on the contrary , the stupid quarter to/quarter past `` viertel vor/viertel nach '' system randomly switches the reference point . 
  i used to assume when people referred to their `` paycheck '' they were using a figure of speech . 
  imagine my surprise when i learned to truth . 
  i just assume you are talking about berlin . 
  there are even parts of munich that look like that . 
  ... why ? 
  like the sound i make when i find mold on my cheese . 
  but not all agree how to pronounce each letter , and not all even have the same letters . 
  cool to see others using \u00f6\u00fc\u00e4 . 
  and it 's the first time i have seen \u00f5 . 
  i like the esperanto word , where it 's koramiko and koramikino , literally ( male/female ) heart-friend . 
  interesting , that 's exactly how you would pronounce that word in german , including the \u00fc . 
  `` in russia , country visits * you * ! '', 
  what would be a good approach to a united europe ? 
  i hope you visit somewhere else in germany some time ; berlin is not really representative . 
  she are a hive mind , obviously . 
  jasmine tea , nothing can beat that flavour . 
  the german equivalent to vercingetorix would be [ arminius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arminius ) , who defended germany against the romans . 
  not with that attitude !, 
  i had latin at school , and let me tell you , it 's a damn hard language with lots of details and exceptions . 
  not even the teacher was fluent . 
  of course i propose esperanto only as second language !, 
  i would never ask anyone to give up their own language or culture , that would be horrible . 
  in fact some people argue esperanto could help * save * minority languages . 
  polish-lithuanian jewish [ ludwik \u0141azarz zamenhof ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l._l._zamenhof ) , born in 1859 bia\u0142ystok , at that time russian empire , today poland . 
  spoke lots of languages . 
  i agree with everything you wrote , and i would love to see ( more ) scientific studies about difficulty of esperanto depending on native tongue . 
  maybe one could use some of all that inefficiently used language education time for it . 
  because it really is inefficient , at least in my country . 
  it takes years , afterwards only part of the class can actually say anything useful . 
  and of course only in english , percentage of people who retain anything from french or spanish must be in the singe digits . 
  i would argue that esperanto is just * so much * easier than other languages , that it could bring benefits quickly with little investment . 
  it 's just my personal experience of course , but i for example tried to learn french as an adult and failed miserable . 
  just to see if i could , i learned esperanto afterwards . 
  and eureka , i actually could . 
  there have been some studies , which of course are probably biased to some extend , that paint a really positive picture of esperanto . 
  to quote wikipedia on one such study :  2000 hours studying german = 1500 hours studying english = 1000 hours studying italian ( or any other romance language ) = 150 hours studying esperanto . 
  something like that could lower the bar to adult language learning enough to make a significant difference . 
  the reason i use esperanto as my argument is simply that it is already established to some extend with a base of speakers and literature . 
  any auxiliary language that came after it had a lot less impact . 
  but i would not be opposed if there was an even `` better '' language . 
  making a language easy truly everyone is hard , for some ( like me ) the english th is hard , some have difficulty distinguishing r and l , some find consonant clusters hard , or [ s ] vs. [ z ] , [ \u0283 ] vs. [ \u0292 ] , and so on . 
  and some others have no problems with any of them , [ x ] seems to me like the easiest sound ever . 
  russians seem to have trouble * not * making it . 
  i think my point is , even it it 's a hard problem , and you can not make it easy for everybody , you still can make it quite a bit easier for a lot of people overall . 
  and now i 'm torn between these two quotes :  we are not so naive as some think of us ; we do not believe that a neutral base will turn men into angels ; we know quite well that the people who are evil will still be evil ; but we believe that communication and relationships based on a neutral base will at least do away with the great mass of brutality and crimes which are caused not by ill will , but simply by mutual misunderstandings and impositions . 
  -- l. l. zamenhof , initiator of esperanto  meanwhile the poor babel fish , by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different cultures and races , has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation . 
  -- the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy, 
  i 'm more of a vestagerist myself . 
  we could call the continent eurasia , and be fine with eu = europa . 
  i still ca n't shake the feeling trump is doing a parody thing . 
  i know that 's nonsense , but when i hear him talk , i get the impression he is just making up bullshit on the spot to see how far he gets . 
  well , if a european asked you `` which kind of american '' , they would not mean your ancestry . 
  they would mean something like this , in order : 1 . 
  * us * - american ? 
  the usa are not the only country in america 2 . 
  which state ? 
  one of the three i would find on a map ? 
  general demographics ? 
  urban or rural , political leaning ? 
  they would find the information that you had an ancestor from italy about as interesting as your shoe size . 
  me too . 
  i find dutch and swiss german far harsher than regular german . 
  it * is * taught in school at some point , but since it 's basically not used in real live , hardly anyone knows about it . 
  maybe i should try ordering 3 hectograms of cheese . 
  you may be right , neonazis would probably insist on calling it k\u00f6nigsberg to make a point , but not everyone who uses that name is a neonazi by far . 
  nowadays almost nobody in germany thinks about this city in their daily life . 
  it basically stopped existing in 1945 . 
  if it was mentioned on tv , they would probably say something `` kaliningrad , formerly known as k\u00f6nigsberg '' . 
  was n't `` a new europe '' what the villains in crimson rivers ii wanted ? 
  greek fast food is the best . 
  reminds me of the ever popular titicaca lake . 
  prost . 
  the difference between spelling and pronunciation was the main thing that made me give up on learning french . 
  it 's like learning two languages at once . 
  why bother still dragging all the conjugations from latin with you , and then just not say them ? 
  it seemed like from every written french word about half of its letters actually make it into sounds . 
  i wonder , have there been serious initiatives for a major spelling reform to make french phonetic ? 
  how many bananas are there in europe !,
