  according to some susy was dead even before the lhc , and according to others there will be a discovery any day now . 
  my hope is that in lhc runii something unexpected will show up . 
  new force carrier , 4th generation particle , magnetic monopoles , stable meson , etc. 
  or even things we can not imagine right now ...

  it may be a tightly bound object , think ( qqqqq ) instead of a em bound baryon-meson-state ( qqq ) -------- ( qq ) . 
  the former would be an entirely new class of hadron . 
  not earth-shattering , but quite remarkable . 
  let me explain . 
  you are looking at data taken with the atlas and cms detectors at the lhc at cern , from 2011 and 2012 . 
  when a higgs boson is produced and decays , you can still reconstruct its mass from the measured decay products . 
  there are other possible things that can happen in a proton proton collision that look like a higgs decay , but we can predict how much and at what reconstructed mass . 
  those are marked in the colored areas , we call them background . 
  as the data is taken over time ( the black dots ) you see that there is a definite difference between predicted background and data . 
  but , if we also put in what higgs decays ( signal ) are predicted to look like ( red ) you see that everything fits nicely . 
  so we reject the background-only hypothesis of only standard model backgrounds in favor of the signal + background hypothesis . 
  which is to say , we think we found it .

  often you will find courses offered from pro-profit language learning institutes , or something wikipedia translates as `` folk high school '' . 
  the bigger your city , the more `` exotic '' languages you might find , generally . 
  you will probably find english , french , spanish and italian courses in most cities . 
  otherwise , there are books to help you self-learn . 
  look at amazon , there are lots for any language you might want . 
  also , computer based courses , a big one is rosetta stone . 
  duolingo is a free service . 
  i use that and a paid one called babbel . 
  after you have basic skills in your new language , talk to people in that language and consume media for some years . 
  congratulation , you now as gloriously proficient as me .

  out of curiosity i googled around a bit , quote from [ a eu document ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/docs/11377r5_en.pdf ) :  in the case of rabies , the co-funded oral vaccination programmes , launched at the end of the 1980s , have proved very successful , as they have led to the steady eradication of rabies from several mss . 
  between 2005 and 2011 , the total number of positive rabies cases at eu level has decreased very significantly from 2,575 cases to 518 . 
  the eradication of rabies from europe is now in sight . 
  this is a unique situation in the world as the eu has achieved rabies eradication on a scale which has never been experienced anywhere else before . 
  the disease has now been confined to the east of the eu and the commission is finalising the provision of funding for the creation of vaccination belts through bilateral agreements between interested member states with their respective neighbours where rabies is still a threat . 
  [ now we wait for this ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2esped_the-simpsons-visit-the-soviet-union_fun ), 
  eu membership protects against rabies ? 
  i mean , what has europe ever accomplished ? 
  they already got their [ undercover agent ] ( http://cds.cern.ch/record/745737?ln=en ) on the cern area earlier . 
  you are right . 
  my thinking was denmark belongs to europe , and greenland to denmark . 
  still , i think my point stands : the idea of europe gets fuzzy around the edges , and finding a bullet proof definition is hard . 
  people can argue all day whether russia or turkey is european or not . 
  well , that argument has some problems . 
  first of all , where do you draw the line between europe and asia ? 
  that 's pretty arbitrary . 
  also islands : sicily , malta , uk , ireland , iceland ? 
  what about greenland , that 's pretty european , too . 
  the spanish cities of ceuta and melilla , which are in africa but also european ? 
  and all territories of the uk and france ? 
  french guiana , across the atlantic , esa launches their satellites there . 
  also european .

  you can still exchange the dm , the rest i dont know . 
  to summarize : you can exchange everything that says dm on it , coins and bills , except some rare ones from before 1951 . 
  to do so , you go into [ one of their branches ] ( http://www.bundesbank.de/navigation/de/bundesbank/hauptverwaltung_und_filialen/hauptverwaltung_und_filialen.html ) , and they will exchange them at the nominal exchange rate , no limits on amount or time . 
  you can also send the money via mail , there is a form on the first page to do that , but they ask you write or phone ahead , if you have more then ~ 2000dm .
