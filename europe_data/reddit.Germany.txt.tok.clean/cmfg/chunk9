  edit : even better , i found the same info in english : http://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/en/standardartikel/tasks/cash_management/free_exchange_dm_euro.html, 
  i missed nine world wars ? 
  how long have i been sleeping !, 
  i love this date !, 
  charlemagne would like a word with you . 
  the sign on the palm tree in the german panel reads : `` dumping debris and snow here is forbidden . '', 
  1999 : sunny until shortly before the eclipse , then clouds all the way through . 
  today : sunny in the morning , now clouds . 
  : '' ' ( edit : according to my office mate , i am now destined to become the captain ahab of solar eclipses . 
  wish me luck . 
  still hoping for `` the culture '', 
  apparently sarkozy offered merkel partial control over the french nuclear arsenal once . 
  you really need to read some history . 
  the democratic elements of the gdr were purely for show . 
  they system was rigged to make sure nobody but * the party * could have any power . 
  for example by total surveillance , torture prisons for dissidents and russian tanks . 
  and quite a capable ship , state of the art martian corvette , later upgraded with an additional rail gun . 
  over my dead body . 
  it they tried that , southern germany would defect and found the republic of real germany together with austria . 
  austria : backup germany . 
  i never liked that idea . 
  why does the choice have to be self-cooked or unhealthy ? 
  why can there not be processed food , that is actually healthy ? 
  surely there is a market for ready made healthy meals . 
  i believe it is a deliberate strategy by the journalists . 
  get things started with some non-surprising names ( putin , the saudis , etc ) to set the mood , and some smaller fish like the icelandic pm , who will fall easily to get things started . 
  and then ramp things up by increasing the ` surprisingness ' of the revelations . 
  more western figures : politicians , actors , athletes , religious leaders . 
  i predict we will see at least 2 of each of these categories from western europe and the us . 
  `` you idiots just do n't understand that people like me do n't have to play by your stupid rules '' for example might have worked . 
  that video more than doubled what i know about slovakia . 
  thank you for listing some of the bullshit believers in unsupported therapies spout, 
  most young people i know switched to postal voting for everything , is that not a thing in the uk ? 
  chicken and egg problem , yes . 
  a lot of esperanto associations will be eternally thankful to you if you can solve it . 
  looked good for a while , but hitler and stalin really screwed it up ( among other things ) . 
  an argument can be made that learning eo first helps with learning others later on , because you can demonstrate how they work without pesky exceptions slowing you down . 
  [ that might be a way in ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gsakuoelsg ) . 
  romance language speakers get a head start that is true . 
  also germanic and slavic speakers to some extend . 
  now , asia and africa . 
  frankly , solving the european tower of babel situation would suffice for me , but consider this : for someone with a totally different language , en and eo are completely foreign , but one of them is regular , and one has [ this ] ( http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html ) . 
  see , i disagree . 
  esperanto really is very easy to learn , because it is so regular and free of the complications of natural languages . 
  if you were to learn esperanto , you would know the totality of its grammar by the end of the day , or hour if you are good with languages . 
  that includes the way you pronounce things , declination and conjugation . 
  given that you as a learner would see progress far faster , fewer people would give up on esperanto than with other languages , because it is just so hard , and so much work . 
  and that would lead to overall higher proficiency . 
  about its sound , well that 's like , your opinion , man . 
  kind of , but there are some problems with it . 
  english is not as easy as people think it is . 
  the pronunciation/spelling of english words is quite irregular , for example . 
  it does take quite a bit of effort go get it approximately right as a second language . 
  i know i am an idealist in this respect , but i really believe esperanto ( or something equally simple to learn ) would benefit international communication . 
  the proportion of people that can carry an actual conversation in english is not that high , most speak it so badly you can not get your point across . 
  to give you a statistically irrelevant anecdote , i one failed to get some kind of flu medicine in a pharmacy in southern france , because not one of them spoke english . 
  esperanto would solve that mess , vivu esperanto !, 
  fascinating . 
  i do n't understand a word they are saying , but the images sound like `` see , our children go to school and do n't starve !, 
  also , we have one computer . 
  we can even afford a dog ! '', 
  similar in germany . 
  he had to do it in order to keep some parts of his party happy , and is now forced make a show to keep his word . 
  also a general tone of being annoyed that gb always wants special treatment . 
  what makes a man turn neutral ? 
  lust for gold ? 
  power ? 
  or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality ? 
  more like ' i started wobbling ' , am i right ? 
  having everybody know a common language would improve so many things in europe . 
  but despite what some people say , learning a foreign language , even english , is * hard * for most people , myself included . 
  it is said , english solved international communication , but in reality the majority of people do n't speak it well enough . 
  i think some streamlined purpose built auxiliary language would be a solution . 
  something like esperanto , which i have come to like , or something entirely new . 
  i truly believe that would make a difference .

  but we pronounce the s in island , because silent letters are of the devil . 
  calm down , invading switzerland would disastrously costly . 
  now belgium on the other hand ... 
  we need to get kerbal space program into the hands of as many nerdy european teenagers as we can , and in 20 years we will be the leading space power . 
  as a german speaker i can understand maybe 30 % of dutch , mostly from german , some from english . 
  no offense , but it sounds like a drunk baby mumbling . 
  danish less than that , and basically nothing from the rest . 
  hell , my comprehension drops rapidly if someone from northern germany digs out their local dialect . 
  similar to swiss german , which is almost ? 
  its own language . 
  thankfully ( almost ) everybody in germany can speak standard german , so the tower of babel situation only kicks in once you reach the international level . 
  there is a german saying , which has some variants , that says : f\u00fcnf minuten vor der zeit , ist des deutschen p\u00fcnktlichkeit . 
  `` five minutes ahead of time , is the punctuality of the german . '', 
  it 's catchier in german . 
  i would welcome canada , australia , and new zealand . 
  for some reason , english language news hate the word `` and '' in their headlines, 
  from time to time people write in / r/germany about how much they feel german , because two of their great-grandparents were , but never have been in germany , know the german language or anything about the country , really . 
  well , gmx is many years older than gmail , so calling it a clone would be a little bit misleading . 
  problem with wind power is its unpredictability , in contrast to coal . 
  atm we do n't have nearly enough energy storage capacity to make up for that . 
  and what about liberland ? 
  about half a year when i had some free time , mostly with duolingo , and some memrise . 
  i would say it 's pretty easy , some say it 's the easiest language there is ; which is why i started doing it , to see if i could at least learn the easiest language , since i failed so miserably at french .
