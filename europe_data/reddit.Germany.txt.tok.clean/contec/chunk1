   it 's hard to believe that any sizable amount of germans care about ukraine 's self-determination from the article : `` and if ukraine says we are going to the eurasian union now , the european union would never make a big conflict out of it , but would insist on a voluntary decision , '' merkel added . 
  this article was about merkel saying that ukraine has to decide for themselves which path they want to take and reinforcing ukraine 's right for self-determination . 
  basically the opposite of what your comment implied . 
  i would rather interpret it as a critique of russia . 
  it 's the polar opposite of what putin said . 
  putin made it clear that there will be consequences if ukraine chose the eu over the customs union . 
  merkel wants to reinforce that ukraine joining the eu is their own choice and not a choice as a consequence of pressure from the west .

  the euro launched on 1 january 1999 as an accounting currency so the graph has the launch date wrong . 
  the trade balance was already growing before the introduction of the euro and even experienced a smaller growth factor for the first 1-2 years after the introduction . 
  germany 's ratio of exports has been steadily growing since 2 years after the reunification the introduction of the euro did n't have a significant influence on that . 
  the foreign trade to gdp ratio also was barely influenced . 
  the growth trend from the mid '90s continued .

  this is wrong . 
  you are comparing usd to euro with data from 2013 but you are using current usd and euro exchange rates . 
  for example using your imf source and 2013 exchange rates france would have a gdp per capita of ~ 33,000 $ and bavaria would have a gdp per capita of ~ 52,000 usd which would be comparable to the usa or canada .

  keep in mind this is only helium plasma , the tests with hydrogen plasma will start next year . 
  some more information :  on 10th december , the day had arrived : the operating team in the control room started up the magnetic field and initiated the computer-operated experiment control system . 
  it fed around one milligram of helium gas into the evacuated plasma vessel , switched on the microwave heating for a short 1,8 megawatt pulse -- and the first plasma could be observed by the installed cameras and measuring devices . 
  `` we 're starting with a plasma produced from the noble gas helium . 
  we 're not changing over to the actual investigation object , a hydrogen plasma , until next year , '' explains project leader professor thomas klinger : `` this is because it 's easier to achieve the plasma state with helium . 
  in addition , we can clean the surface of the plasma vessel with helium plasmas . ''  the first plasma in the machine had a duration of one tenth of a second and achieved a temperature of around one million degrees . 
  `` we 're very satisfied '' , concludes dr. hans-stephan bosch , whose division is responsible for the operation of the wendelstein 7-x , at the end of the first day of experimentation . 
  `` everything went according to plan . '' the next task will be to extend the duration of the plasma discharges and to investigate the best method of producing and heating helium plasmas using microwaves . 
  after a break for new year , confinement studies will continue in january , which will prepare the way for producing the first plasma from hydrogen . 
  yeah , it 's missing about 500 breweries for bavaria alone . 
  it was built in the 1880s as seat of the local government ( regierungsbezirk breslau ) in the style of dutch neo-renaissance . 
  it 's not going to happen but something similar would be possible . 
   an alternative and somewhat more radical possibility would be for the mainstream member states to agree on a new , treaty-based partnership with ` an independent institutional structure outside the framework of the `` old eu ''' ( effectively , a ` new union ' ) to be ` worked out , approved and ratified solely by the states participating in this new entity ' . 
  while , on the face of it , this alternative might appear ingenious , it would not be ideal . 
  one obvious disadvantage of ` recreating ' the treaties with one member fewer is that the new ` replacement ' treaty would exist in parallel with the existing treaties , even though these would be no more than empty shells . 
  there would inevitably be appreciable scope for competition between the ` old ' union and the ` new ' , and the risk of a division within europe as a result of their rivalry . 
  besides , the alternative of a new treaty being entered into after its signatories have renounced the existing treaties could only work if all mainstream member states agreed to leave the errant member state out of the eu . 
  in all likelihood , such a decision would be thwarted not only by the threatened member state but also by some of its more euro-sceptic partners . 
  ultimately , the likelihood of a ` new ' union coming into being is fairly small , requiring ` a massive political effort on the side of the participating states ' and entailing ` yet another treaty adventure , the outcome of which is totally unpredictable ' . 
   thus , marginalising a member state , even if not formally expelling it , would not be impossible , but none of the avenues available for achieving it would be ideal . 
  persuading a member state to withdraw , by making use of the proposed exit clause or resorting to the regular treaty revision procedure , may be the better option .

  could n't the member states in favor of an eu army make use of article 20 of the teu :  1 . 
  member states which wish to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves within the framework of the union 's non-exclusive competences may make use of its institutions and exercise those competences by applying the relevant provisions of the treaties , subject to the limits and in accordance with the detailed arrangements laid down in this article and in articles 326 to 334 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
   enhanced cooperation shall aim to further the objectives of the union , protect its interests and reinforce its integration process . 
  such cooperation shall be open at any time to all member states , in accordance with article 328 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union  2 . 
  the decision authorising enhanced cooperation shall be adopted by the council as a last resort , when it has established that the objectives of such cooperation can not be attained within a reasonable period by the union as a whole , and provided that at least nine member states participate in it . 
  the council shall act in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 329 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  all members of the council may participate in its deliberations , but only members of the council representing the member states participating in enhanced cooperation shall take part in the vote . 
  the voting rules are set out in article 330 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union  4 . 
  acts adopted in the framework of enhanced cooperation shall bind only participating member states . 
  they shall not be regarded as part of the acquis which has to be accepted by candidate states for accession to the union . 
  so if i understand this correctly they could go ahead with further integration of their military forces if at least 9 eu countries participate .
