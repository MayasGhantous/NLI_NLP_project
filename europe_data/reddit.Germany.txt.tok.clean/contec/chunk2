  ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/macroeconomic-imbalance-procedure/scoreboard_en ) as you can see from the [ scoreboard ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bwopq1p.png ) ( 2015 ) almost every country has a few imbalances . 
  the data is reviewed by the commission and then countries are put into different categories : no imbalance , imbalance , excessive imbalance [ you can read the in-depth reviews of specific countries here . 
  ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/macroeconomic-imbalance-procedure/depth-reviews_en ) if a country has excessive imbalances the commission can trigger the excessive imbalance procedure which opens the possibility for fines or sanctions . 
  so far the commission never triggered this procedure despite [ some countries having excessive imbalances . 
  does n't change the fact that it 's not illegal , the author of the article you are posting is wrong . 
  you can read the relevant legislation here : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a32011r1176 for the eu to be able to impose fines or sanctions there need to be excessive macroeconomic imbalances and not just imbalances for one or a few indicators . 
  a current account surplus of more than 6 % is not illegal under eu law , it is just one of many indicators of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure in which germany is scoring better than a lot of other eu countries . 
   germany is only in second place because of the use of `` loopholes '' . 
  so , yeah , crappy headline is crappy . 
  higher score in `` land use/ets surplus loophole '' means more support to close these loopholes , not that the country is making use of loopholes . 
   and as soon as we 'll get it , it 's going towards paying what we already owe , so it 's just going back to you . 
  no need to stress yourself out mate . 
  most loans from the eu have an average maturity of about 30 years and the first loans from eurozone governments are due 2020 . 
  at the moment you are mostly paying back treasury bill holders . 
  the difference is governments have direct control over the budget while they can only indirectly influence macroeconomic imbalances . 
  therefore different processes are needed . 
  the process for the 3 % budget deficit rule is part of the maastricht criteria and outlined in [ article 126 of the teu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a12012e%2ftxt ) . 
  the 6 % current account surplus indicator is one of eleven indicators of the mip . 
  [ not a single eu country has a clean sheet on the scoreboard and a lot of countries score worse than germany ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?qid=1476350538568&amp;uri=celex:52015dc0691 ) . 
  the european commission can only initiate [ corrective measures ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/all/?uri=celex:32011r1174 ) if there are excessive imbalances which is not the case for germany , [ you can read the reasoning in the in-depth review ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/cr2016_germany_en.pdf ) . 
  the latin lyrics might be more fitting as an anthem for the eu but considering the music was written to fit the lyrics in the first place i do n't think you can beat the original version . 
  it does n't make nationality useless but it makes it harder to assign a modern nationality to a person the further you go back in time and i do n't think any historian would deny that . 
  especially with the territorial clusterfuck of the holy roman empire . 
  no , for most historical figures it is pretty clear cut but mozart is a special case for the reasons mentioned above . 
  this controversy on his nationality does n't exist for no reason . 
   that probably has to do with the fact that austria as a sovereign country exists since 1945 . before that we were always a part ( leading or not ) of a union/empire . 
  which leads back to my original point of modern nationalities . 
   according to your logic , tesla was more austrian than mozart was german :d every dutchman from the 18th century is austrian too , and so forth ... and by your logic kant would be russian ... 
  i was n't calling mozart german but i 'm saying that it 's inaccurate to call him purely austrian or german . 
  it 's really not as clear cut as you make it out . 
  calling mozart austrian is a rather modern phenomenon that only became more popular in the last 50 years . 
  his father was from augsburg and mozart was born in salzburg which at the time was part of bavaria and only became part of austria some years after his death . 
  ] ( https://books.google.de/books?id=fffhigxirb8c&amp;pg=pa375&amp;dq=vaterland&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=vaterland&amp;f=false ) you were saying ? 
  [ assigning a modern nationality to a historic figure can be tricky . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozart%27s_nationality ) he was both austrian and german . 
  the netherlands is benefiting more from a weak euro than germany since they have a bigger current account surplus with non-eu countries as % of gdp . 
  also germany has been the most outspoken critic of qe which is one of the main reasons the euro is so weak . 
  firstly italy and other eu countries all signed the dublin agreement , if they did n't like the terms they could 've opposed it . 
  i do n't find any source on google that would suggest that germany opposed the suspension of the dublin agreement more than any other non-external border country or evidence that suggests that it worked in germany 's favor since you can only deport asylum seekers under the dublin agreement if they are already registered in another eu country . 
  external border countries of the eu ignored that duty and refugees went to other eu countries in western and northern europe , a lot of which have had a higher number of refugees per capita than greece or italy over the past decades . 
  furthermore germany is one of the few eu countries to this day that actually temporarily suspended the dublin agreement . 
  if the eu would 've tried to implement a quota system at the time it surely would n't be germany who opposed it since germany already took more than their fair share even while the dublin agreement was in place . 
  could you provide a source for that claim ? 
  you are severely overestimating merkel 's power in the eu if you think she could 've implemented these measures . 
  even before the refugee crisis there was no political will in the eu for a quota system or most of the other actions you mention . 
  there are 27 other eu countries most of which have been more quiet and passive than germany before and during this crisis , so i do n't get why you put most of the blame on merkel . 
  it 's a failure of the eu as a whole , not merkel . 
  in your opinion which concrete actions should merkel have taken to avoid the refugee crisis ? 
  it was largely caused by external factors which merkel does n't have power over . 
  even years before the refugee crisis germany had the most refugees of any developed country . 
   [ among industrialized countries , germany ranks as the largest hosting country with 571,700 refugees . 
  ( 2011 ) ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/4fd9e6266.html ) and  [ from 2007-2011 germany had a higher number of asylum-seekers per $ 1 gdp \\ ( ppp \\ ) per capita than italy \\ ( 4.4 vs 3.6 \\ ) . 
  ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/4e9beaa19.html ) so you ca n't really accuse germany about not caring or pulling their weight . 
   and those that have been rebuilt do n't very much resemble the old ones . 
  [ in this case they do .

  for comparison , this one was 250kg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwjmf5wwll0, 
  brutalism gets a lot of hate . 
  it can look nice when done right : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geisel_library ( futurism/brutalism ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habitat_67 ( metabolism/brutalism ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phillips_exeter_academy_library ( modernism/brutalism ), 
  what is it with foreign language textbooks and parrots . 
  all i remember from french lessons is `` arthur est un perroquet '', 
  an upper limit would be nothing more than empty populism . 
  but this sub seems to have a hard-on for that when it comes to the refugee crisis . 
  the german figures are a bit misleading since up until 2011 the population in germany was extrapolated from the 1981 east german and 1987 west german census and was estimated too high . 
  the population numbers were corrected with the 2011 census and as a result we lost about 1.6 million people from 2010 to 2011 on paper . 
  the real population growth from 2007 to 2017 is probably somewhere between 2-2 .5 % . 
  not really . 
  it is misleading to compare consumer spending between countries as this article does because the services provided by the government and price levels relative to the income differ . 
  if you look at the actual individual consumption which accounts for these differences germany has the second highest consumption in the eu . 
   so apparently not all documents were simply published ? 
  if so , why not ? 
  up until 2011 the population in germany was extrapolated from the 1981 east german and 1987 west german census . 
  the population numbers were corrected with the 2011 census and as a result we lost about 1.4 million people from 2010 to 2011 on paper . 
  it 's probably safe to assume that if you did a census in the year 2000 the population would have been lower by a couple hundred thousand people at least . 
  also the 2017 number used in the op is wrong by about 1.6 million , according to the latest data there are around 82.2 million people in germany ( 2015 ) and with the recent trend of immigration i would n't be surprised if we 're past 83 million by now . 
  this does n't have anything to do with east or west , it 's simply because cities like leipzig do n't have housing shortages and the landlords ca n't be as picky when choosing tenants as a result . 
  some of the indicators they use are questionable  wikipedia yearly edits  video uploads on youtube  national feature films produced etc. 
  -- the indicators used in the [ european innovation scoreboard ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/facts-figures/scoreboards_en ) seem more sensible to measure innovation . 
  there are a lot more companies in france than companies in the cac40 . 
  this has nothing to do with your initial claim of `` frances effective corporation tax rate is lower than ireland 's '', 
  i quoted a blog because it 's concise and links to another study that is n't inherently flawed . 
  even the author of the article you just posted argues against your claim :  it was misleading that the french effective rate was presented as typically 8 % ; it was misleading to claim that the irish rate applying to foreign firms was close to the headline rate of 12.5 % -- it ignored the fact that the profits were shifted from irish onshore companies to offshore companies while in the case of apple most of its foreign profits were booked in the irish shell companies , which used the address of apple 's cork facility . 
  this is highly misleading . 
   when ireland 's leaders defend their country from accusations that global companies like apple use irish law to avoid taxes in other countries , they frequently cite a study prepared by the world bank and pricewaterhousecoopers . 
  it found that ireland has an effective tax rate of 12.3 % , higher than other european countries and places like bermuda and the caymans that are traditionally considered tax havens . 
   the only problem is that the study is based on a hypothetical firm 's hypothetical tax payments . 
  and that hypothetical firm only has 60 employees , is domestically owned , does n't import or export anything , and makes ceramic flower pots . 
  that 's not exactly a recipe for identifying the taxes paid by large multinational companies largely engaged in trade and reliant on intellectual property . 
  some people from the left have been using it for quite some time . 
  \u017di\u017eek for example . 
   [ the task is to move beyond mere tolerance of others to a positive emancipatory leitkultur which can sustain authentic co-existence . 
  do n't just respect others , offer a common struggle , since our problems today are common . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/25/european-union-slovenia ) --  [ tolerance is not a solution there . 
  what we need is what the germans call a leitkultur , a higher leading culture that regulates the way in which the subcultures interact . 
  multiculturalism , with its mutual respect for the sensitivities of the others , no longer works when it gets to this `` impossible-\u00e0-supporter '' stage . 
  devout muslims find it impossible to tolerate our blasphemous images and our disrespectful humor , which constitute a part of our freedom . 
  but the west , with its liberal practices , also finds forced marriages or the segregation of women , which are a part of muslim life , to be intolerable . 
  that 's why i , as a leftist , argue that we need to create our own leading culture . 
  ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/slavoj-zizek-greatest-threat-to-europe-is-it-s-inertia-a-1023506.html ), 
  i would say the statistic picked the worst possible time range for germany .
