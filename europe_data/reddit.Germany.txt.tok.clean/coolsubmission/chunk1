that 's not because of refugees . 
  it 's more because of low interests rates . 
  show is called extra 3 , name of the segment is nnn ( short for neueste nationale nachrichten / newest national news ) if you search in youtube for nnn you 'll find some . 
  cant link atm as i 'm in mobile . 
  i did n't call the afd fascists , also i have to say [ calling for more lebensraum while defending holocaust deniers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eghsvrwhmi ) , [ saying that we were driven into ww2 by the polish ] ( http://www.rbb-online.de/kontraste/archiv/kontraste-27-10-2016/reichsbuerger-gedankengut_in_der_afd__.html ) , [ desire to rehabilitate a deeply racist term ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/afd-co-chair-petry-wants-to-rehabilitate-controversial-term/a-19543222 ) , [ doing an extremely racist speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487wmxiraru ) , wishing for [ `` a thousand years of germany . 
  '' ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-afd-unites-old-conservatives-with-radical-right/a-18802468 ) , stating that [ the jews are the inner enemy while the islam is the outer enemy of germany ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/antisemitische-thesen-von-afd-abgeordneten-gedeon-14268327.html ) and the [ the protocols of the elders of zion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protocols_of_the_elders_of_zion ) are legit . . you know these things does n't make it easy to resist the desire to call them by this evil buzzword - fascists . 
  there are limits on that . 
  fascist ideology over the limit . 
  i see . 
  still , it 's hilariously whiny for an ideology based on a worshipping strength etc. . . we have a segment in a comedy show in germany where a dubbed hitler rants about nowadays right-wing extremists in germany and ridicules them based on their ridiculous display of greatness and pathos [ e.g. 
  this glorious torch ceremony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahkegixrbiy ) . 
  or as someone else said it : `` there 's nothing funnier than nazis without power '' . 
  oh yes , the poor fascists and their totally fine politics . 
  it baffles me when eastern europeans promote it . 
  are n't they aware that if their heros would 've won , they and everyone they know would be dead or living a life in slave labour ? 
  do you whine because they ca n't promote their fascist bullshit on facebook ? 
  sshh . . do n't rain on his parade ... facts are n't helping if you wan na push an agenda . 
   but that does n't mean we 're not a democracy . 
  and she did n't said that . 
  translation by dw.com  `` germany and america are bound by their values : democracy , freedom , the respect for the law and the dignity of human beings , independent of their origin , skin color , religion , gender , sexual orientation or political position , '' she added . 
  `` on the basis of these values i offer the future president of the united states , donald trump , close cooperation . '', 
  it 's more of an appeal to trump to not change it or start discriminating people or start torturing war criminals etc. . 
  ... and thats why i 'm not pursuing a career in translation !, 
  it may be lost in my translation . 
  in german it sounds more like `` ugh , now we ** have to ** work with him '' in my opinion . 
  like we have to but we rather would not . 
  not really . 
  or rather depends on what you are going at . 
  yes , it needs a votum of the legislative ( or rather the joint committee in case of an russian attack ) to formally declare the state of defense . 
  however our armed forces will have a go-ahead before . 
  it 's just that the state is n't formally in the state of defense . 
  the big differences by the state of defence will be : * chancellor becomes the commander-in-chief * laws are easier to enact , regarding any matter except laws regarding human rights and the constitution . 
  * federal governments may issue instructions to state governments . 
  * conscription may start again . 
  * electoral terms are extended until the state of defense is lifted or the frg cease to exist . 
  * temporary provisions concerning the compensation for expropriations may differ from the requirements laid down in the constitution . 
  ( seizure of important goods , nationalization of industry aka transition to war economy ) * a law may rule that people arrested by police may be held in custody for four days before being brought before a judge . 
  however , this applies only if no judge has been able to act in the normal time limit . 
  thanks !,

  do you have a link ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  there 's still nato , there are still eu defense agreements . 
  putin is ruthless but not dumb . 
  he 's not gon na take a stab at any nato country hoping that the other countries wo n't do anything . 
  the bigger issue is honestly trump , because he can start a war and he 's proven to have irrational anger issues with no checks in place . 
  anyone whose so thin-skinned that he can be provoked by any 13-year-old with a twitter account and completely goes ballistic ( in a figurative way ) , is n't fit for a position of power . 
  yeah , but on the same time it 's a thin line between representing the government and doing party politics . 
  the comment from the vice-chancellor is pure party politics due to reactionary politics from the afd . 
  [ the internationale ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_internationale ) is meant as a warning of the rising reactionary/right-wing forces in the western world . 
  the statement from the justice minister is an edgy twitter comment and no official statement in his position as minister . 
  because they cater to the german people and do n't expect that their words have a bigger [ international ] audience . 
  also , perhaps because of the stereotype of the more direct german . 
   you ca n't expect from responsible leaders to give dodgy opinions about it , no matter what they actually think . 
  yeah . . about that . .  vice-chancellor : trump is also a warning to us . 
  he 's the figurehead of an authoritarian and chauvinistic internationale  foreign minister : i do n't want to sugarcoat , it 's gon na be difficult . 
   defense minister : it was a heavy shock [ ... ] now we have to deal with the new reality . 
   justice minister : the world wo n't go down , the world just get 's crazier . 
   cdu leader of parliamentary group : we have to work together with trump . 
  on the flip side he should also realize that a good relationship to europe and germany also benefits the us . 
   eu parliament president : i 'm not glad ... 
  but on the other side i believe the political system of the usa is so strong that they also frame/contain a president trump . 
   green party leader : it 's a break from the former tradition that the west stands for liberal values . 
   left party leader : he 's not gon na be able to deliver on his promises he made to his people . 
  he 's gon na be on the way to an authoritarian society . 
  [ relevant video ] ( https://youtu.be/uxmsnpbmvyy?t=315 ) : conversation between ex-chancellor [ helmut schmidt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helmut_schmidt ) and [ wolfgang sch\u00e4uble ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolfgang_sch%c3%a4uble ) loosely translated :  [ 5:17 ] sch\u00e4 . 
  : well , i 'm a bit younger . . 
   [ 5:29 ] schm . 
  : how old are you ? 
   [ 5:21 ] sch\u00e4 . 
  : i 'm 61 [ . . ]  [ 5:22 ] schm : oh , that 's a quarter century [ that we are apart ] , boy . 
  : and another generation !, 
  i have no memories of the war . 
   [ 5:30 ] schm . 
  : ( quite pensive , look at his expression from this moment on ) : yeah ... that is what made me worry about this country , but also europe as a whole , in the last months ... that people are deciding about peace and war who have no real clue what peace and war really are [ / are really like ] . 
   [ 5:55 ] sch\u00e4 . 
  : i believe it 's one of the big differences between america and europe . 
  the americans have no experience of war . 
   [ 6:03 ] schm . 
  : you are right ... it 's gon na be a bad/severe century . 
   [ 6:10 ] sch\u00e4 . 
  : worse than the last ? 
   [ 6:11 ] schm . 
  : yes . 
  btw your link does n't proof your point . 
  also , it 's something different . 
  political motivated crime is a special case . 
  that 's why the police has a special department for it ( staatsschutz ) and why terrorism is n't simply investigated as the different parts of the crime . 
  but i get it , you will further adhere to your asylum seekers and/or migrants ( brown people ) are bad , mkay ? 
  that 's nothing new , but mainly they turn a blind eye because right-wing crimes are bad for the image of your village/city . 
  attacks on migrants/leftists by neonazis become `` fights between youth groups '' etc, 
  no , but that 's what happens if a ) you do commit crimes that are hard to solve and b ) the police turns a blind eye towards you . 
  because there is no big voter base for such bullshit . 
  but e.g. 
  the afd is also heavily involved in these things . 
  see e.g. 
  their homophobic stance and the [ lobby organisations ] ( https://lobbypedia.de/wiki/beatrix_von_storch ) of von storch . 
  ( ok there are not really conservative but rather right-wing extremists , but still . . ), 
  hahahahahahahahahaha do you often mix up words like correct and stupid ?
