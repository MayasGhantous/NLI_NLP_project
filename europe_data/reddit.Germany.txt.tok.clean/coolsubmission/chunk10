  it 's a simple thing : introducing a cap means abolishing basic rights . 
  you ca n't say `` humans have the basic right to xy ! ... 
  but only the first 5000 '' . 
  that 's not how it works . 
   even encouraging with social services , access to labour market and citizenship , lol , ever read the german asyl laws ? 
  [ look into the past ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/graphics/d27_2bv_d.gif ), 
   when possible keyword . 
  problem is what 's deemed possible . 
  when i heard that quote by the bavarian minister of interior i 'm highly skeptical of it . 
  '' [ we expect of our soldiers to fight in that country hence we can expect of the refugees to live in the country ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ziy5mxa.jpg ) '' . . flawless logic / s the only accepted reason to flee a country is that we ca n't demand of our soldiers to fight there because it 's too bad . 
   so unless the us were planning on breaking major international law and assassinate/snatch him illegally , he 'd be fairly safe in germany . 
  it 's not like [ there 's an precedent . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeffrey_carney ) they kidnapped one before .

  fuck off and [ follow your leader ] ( http://i.imgur.com/soty7et.jpg ) . 
  yeah , there will be only lizard people left , right ? 
  yeah , because we just pray to the pink unicorn and * puff * suddenly there 's infrastructure , a social net , etc. 
  what we need is an international effort to close tax loopholes and stop tax lowering . 
  wtf ? 
  surprise : that had less to do about the country and more about the ideology . 
  which is pretty similar to that of golden dawn . 
  lpt : do n't want to be called a racist ? 
  do n't say racist shit or do racist shit . 
  yeah , just wanted to add it to your comment . 
  because often people see a half empty bundestag and no real debates and complain that no ones working there etc. . 
  the work and debate is going on in the commitees while the the speeches in plenary sessions are more or less just an explanation for their politics and a campaigning for the voters . 
  this . 
  i do n't get the notion of many people of `` human rights are a good thing - as long as nobody uses them '' . 
  [ calling for more lebensraum while defending holocaust deniers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eghsvrwhmi ) , [ saying that we were driven into ww2 by the polish ] ( http://www.rbb-online.de/kontraste/archiv/kontraste-27-10-2016/reichsbuerger-gedankengut_in_der_afd__.html ) , [ desire to rehabilitate a deeply racist term ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/afd-co-chair-petry-wants-to-rehabilitate-controversial-term/a-19543222 ) , [ doing an extremely racist speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487wmxiraru ) , wishing for [ `` a thousand years of germany .

   programmatic politics is to be done on party conventions , in ~ ~ parliament debates ~ ~ [ commitees ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbeitsparlament ) and eventually during cabinet meetings and the chancellor , out of these controversial proposals from all sides , picks those that somehow fit his/her world view and make political sense and then drafts a government guideline for the term that in detail is implemented by the ministers ( which is why the distribution of ministries among the governing parties tends to play a rather big role in germany ) . 
  huh . 
  expected a picture of gabriel and/or schr\u00f6der . 
  whats with them ? 
  do you really think germans should vote for a right-wing extremist party ? 
  yeah , because calling them something else which does n't describes their politics and ideology as good as that is surely going to help . 
  given how far removed from reality they are , even in their own county , i doubt that they can learn anything . 
  no , common sense . 
  at least hofer is for the anschluss . 
   if things keep going like this it 's going to be the century of stupidity . 
  well , it currently looks like it is . 
  trump in the us , le pen in france , ukip in the uk , afd in germany , pvv in netherlands , hofer & fp\u00d6 in austria etc etc etc, 
   but you could , and some people have , made the argument that it 's against the interests of germany , for example . 
  and it would be wrong nonetheless . 
  but that typically does n't matter to right-wing nutjobs . 
  `` this constitutional order '' refers to the senctences before :  ( 1 ) the federal republic of germany is a democratic and social federal state . 
   ( 2 ) all state authority is derived from the people . 
  it shall be exercised by the people through elections and other votes and through specific legislative , executive and judicial bodies . 
   ( 3 ) the legislature shall be bound by the constitutional order , the executive and the judiciary by law and justice . 
  none of that was violated because the german state helped some refugees . 
   golden dawn members scum of the earth . 
  fine , then substitutes home with neighbourhood . 
  destruction of the eu is a disadvantage for any country in it . 
  especially for the smaller ones and for the economically weaker states . 
   so being opposed to mass immigration and the eu ( at least as it currently exists ) you automatically qualify as a nazi ? 
  1 ) `` refugees '' - / - `` migrants '' . 
  2 ) no , opposing mass immigration does n't make you nazi . 
  the way the current anti-immigration parties oppose mass immigration makes them right-wing extremists . 
  3 ) destroying your home out of fear that it could possibly perhaps be damaged in the future is a fucking stupid thing to do . 
  but whatever floats your boat i guess . 
  cultural marxismus , the new jewish world conspiracy :d ca n't these right wing nutjobs invent some other story after 70 years ? 
   apparently everyone who goes to the bundeswehr is a nazi in the public eye . 
  what a bullshit you are talking . 
  it 's not everyone who goes to bundeswehr . 
  it 's everyone who goes to bundeswehr and is glorifying the wehrmacht , everyony who goes to the bundeswehr and puts up images of nazi soldiers along with other devotionalia from the time . 
  everyone who goes to the bundeswehr and writes a master thesis in which he warns about `` mixing of races '' and describes human rights as a `` infectious character '' of which only minorities should have an interest in . 
  everyone who goes to the bundeswehr and is planning a right-wing extremist terror attack . 
  etc etc etc, 
  maybe it 's in austria similar to germany . 
  how old were you ? 
  the same sentiment that you has is widespread in germany , but it 's not based on reality . 
  the content of history lessons cover a wide aspect of history from roman times up to cold war . 
  however , since it 's mostly chronological , many people only remember the history lessons from when they were older . 
  hence the notion that `` it was only ww2 '', 
  so , every country that has a taxation is killing huge amounts of people ? 
  your logic has flaws . 
  : rolleyes : first of all im not a commie second i stand by my point . 
  the proposed way to abolish classes isnt killing one of them , its transaction of means of production to the working classes . 
  its not abolishing the classes by killing one of them . 
  maybe take a political book and read it for once ? 
  none of that is inherent to communism though . 
  all , lies in the press , says propaganda minister goebbels , right ? 
  sigh, 
  : rolleyes :, 
  ( economic ) liberal conservative party, 
  i 'm pretty sure that such laws are nothing more than rough guidelines in case of world war 3 . 
   officials say the obstacles are only apparent during peacetime exercises and planning , and that during a real military emergency , nato 's supreme allied commander for europe -- based in mons , belgium -- would simply warn allies and deploy as needed . 
  yeah , this . 
  i do n't think any e.g. 
  polish border guard would care for passport checks of a nato convoy driving into poland from germany/czechia if russia attacks poland . 
  yeah . 
  much freely when held at gunpoint . 
  go fuck yourself, 
   if we apply the standards of un and human rights watch to the fullest extent wtf ? 
  are you even able to read ? 
   they are not tied to libya , but have homes elsewhere , of which they are fleeing . 
   so your whole emotional argument about violence falls apart . 
  ah yes , human rights . 
  that whole emotional thing . 
  / s  they do not have to be in libya if they do n't want to.they choose to subject themselves to such treatment yes , because they do n't know about this treatment beforehand and because they falsely think libya is the safest way .
