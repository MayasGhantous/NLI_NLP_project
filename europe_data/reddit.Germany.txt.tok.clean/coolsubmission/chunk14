   please tell me what is so funny about being a patriot and wanting to preserve your culture and genealogy ? 
  get yourself a history book ffs, 
  iirc they elected their military commanders . 
  sometimes before every battle, 
  but what do i expect from someone with patriot in the name ? 
  actual facts ? 
  are they as much not pirates as their captain is as much not arrested under human traficking charges ? 
  do me a favor . 
  buy a gun , fly to africa and shoot them yourself instead of cowardly advocating for their deaths by other means . 
  at least that way you stay true to your values . 
  they are rebranded neonazis . 
  do n't take these fuckers seriously . 
   why is it a big deal ? 
  what do i miss ? 
  does a warning like this really influence people so much ? 
  yes . 
  they question the credit-insurance ?!, 
  for german turkish business deals . 
  ah , the old art of purposefully misunderstanding . 
  i thought it was lost in todays ' discourse . 
  well , support for a dictatorship and racist views do n't tend to do well with rational people . 
  ok , guessed so . 
  thanks !, 
  so this is total years ? 
  as in if a part belonged to poland from 1 to 5 and 7 to 10 it would show as 8 ? 
  yes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tigerfibel,

  lol what ? 
  most graffiti comes * surprise * from [ sprayers ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/graffiti#style-writing ) . 
  next often is probably football fans . 
  yep , just water . 
  [ water cannons are harmless ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389360686648/protest-against-stuttgart-015.jpg ), 
  [ inspired by the live stream ?

  considering that the source of the injuries doesnt matter in the statistics ( if you are hit by a stone or tripped while getting out of bed is the same ) and every cop who skips duty for the day counts as `` severely '' injured , these statistics are bullshit, 
  it 's different statistics from a the federal police ( green ) and from a ngo ( blue ) . 
  so , both ? 
  ah yes , the [ calm and restrained right-wing extremists ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/graph/png/fl%c3%bcchtlingsfeindliche_angriffe_in_der_bundesrepublik_deutschland/0/8792377349a88b29ad5650043d58bca5692decc6.png ) / s, 
  [ msnbc report from right in the middle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m0sgvb6n5s ), 
  to protest ? 
  that 's typically the main point of demonstrations . 
  also , it 's not the antifa that 's demonstrating . 
  abolishing discrimination is always a benefit, 
  at least a year ago , there were differences regarding certain inheritance issues by farms etc. . 
  since when ? 
  got a link ? 
  also full equal rights . 
  adoption wasnt the only difference , there were differences regarding e.g. 
  inheritance and medical authority ( making decisions for your partner if s/he 's unconscious etc ) , too . 
  they are very prone to shooting pepper spray into crowds without need . 
  they provoke by themselves by insulting protesters and harassing them . 
  they do n't use their discretion by handling violations of the ban of `` passive weapons '' ( = read `` protective '' gear ) and clothes used to hide the face etc. 
  it 's not deescalation if you attack a demonstration and injure dozens of people just because one guy might 've had a scarf on his upper lip right under the nose ... there are tons of aggressive people in german police force , especially in the bereitschaftspolizeien , ( ~ riot cops ) , there are also tons of wrong tactics/decisions and no functional oversight/supervision process in place . 
  the german police is n't bad , but let 's not pretend that it 's perfect , they have still many many flaws . 
   german police has been training deescalation for quite some time . 
  then why do n't they use this training once in a while ? 
   to be fair , they were absolutely surprised by the situation . 
  the brazenness of those goons probably had not been a situation they were prepared for . 
  given that there was also a brawl the year before , they should 've been prepared . 
   i do n't think it 's fair to blame the sun and mail for hate-mongering . 
  are we in the same thread ? 
  it 's a [ seal ] ( https://i.redd.it/v5yezhuq57ky.gif ), 
  also financed by an arms dealer ... 
  so theres that, 
  lol no . 
   what exactly has trump done that is `` right-wing extremist ? '', 
  having a fascist as a chief strategist ? 
   telekom : our data shows that virtually nobody uses more than 2gb . . 
  so as nobody needs more we dont need to offer more . 
  yes , every data over 2gb costs 5 $ extra for each 100mb why do you ask ? 
  so , stalin got to do as he wishes . 
  he could achieved his plans . 
  if he were * just * as bad as the nazis , there would be a [ 85 % chance that ( judging by your flair ) you would be dead/never been born as a pole and a 15 % chance that you and your ancestors got `` lucky '' and would have survived in slavery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) . 
  so yeah , the nazis did n't achieved their plan in full , but while stalin was a also genocidal tyrant , he was n't nearly as bad as the nazis . 
  the nazis murdered [ 6 + million polish citizens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_poland ) in a bit over 5 years , it 's hard to top that . 
  yeah . . an orator with promoting , commanding and conducting industrial genocide as an ideology . 
  lpt : there are history books readily available in libraries . 
  at least learn something about history before trivializing the nazis . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  they seem to be longer in power than the democratic ones . 
  i assume that position was a high position at the end of ones career , e.g. 
  until retirement/death ? 
  yeah , but just out of interest , how long did they served ? 
  was it also quite short term or were the soviet installed guys long-term ?

  they want us ultimately scared . 
  dead people does this . 
  if the media were to portray every traffic accident with graphic images , breaking news , discussion shows in the evening , etc. . people would be too scared to drive on the road . 
  we have actually less terror victims in west europe than in the last decades , what we got instead ( and what 's driven the terror fear and actually helps the terrorists ) is the media reporting . 
  with social media , the internet and normally sinking sales of newspapers we are no live at the terror attack . 
  we do n't just hear about it in the radio and in the evening with the speaker announcing that xy happened and some comment of the police spokesman . 
  we are live there , we see the picture of horrified frightened people , of injured people , of blood and death . 
  we no longer have a separating middle man in between us and the terror . 
  and that 's what drives the people up the wall . 
  no he 's absolutely right . 
  terror needs that attention and fear .
