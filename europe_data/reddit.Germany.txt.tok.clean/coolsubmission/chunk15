  the purpose of terror is to instill fear . 
  if the population does n't shit themselves over every terror attack , the terror is qua definition not successful . 
   hundreds of thousands of unknown young men from the most violent regions in the world right behind open borders of czechia . . on which merkel had no influence . 
  it was either letting them rot on balkans and risk an humanitarian crisis in the middle of europe or let them in . 
  merkel even wanted to close the german border at one point early on but not official gave her the confirmation that such an action would be constitutional . 
  and by a decade and half ago you mean ... 2012 ? 
  is voat finally shut down ? 
   google can kill you if they wanted . 
  on a related note [ samsung can do it , too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa08gbn6iqs ), 
  you know nothing about police in germany apparently . 
  honestly , if you got just beaten up would you go to their collagues and complain ? 
  also , as soon as you complain or even just states that you were injured you will be facing charges yourself . 
  here 's the source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction yeah sarkozy was a dumbass . 
  however control over them would n't change much anyway . 
  i do n't see any big conflict coming between germany and france . 
  in case of loose of trust/shared defense between them , germany is able to produce nuclear bombs nonetheless in the time frame it takes the relationship to deteriorate to a point where no shared defense is given . 
   it 's not like france is going to lend its nukes to anyone . 
  only to germany . 
   in september 2007 the french president nicolas sarkozy offered germany to participate in the control over the french nuclear arsenal . 
  chancellor merkel and foreign minister steinmeier declined the offer however , stating that germany `` had no interest in possessing nuclear weapons '' . 
  * it 's not porn if it 's on arte *, 
   i immediately know i 'm watching a crap us documentary when they use a certain type of voice-over . 
  also , because they have there stupid repetitions every 3 minutes . . 
  til helping people out of solidarity is extremism . 
  okay , that 's a new one . 
  how does this work on a flat earth ? 
   even if you buy into the bs that nuclear power is unsafe what are you , expecting a tsunami in switzerland ? 
  no , but neglect from companies . 
  at least that 's the thing in germany . 
  if you want to operate a nuclear plant - put safety first and profits afterwards . 
  not the other way round as the operators do it . 
  sweden into axis this time ? 
  did you mean [ compassionate ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/angela-merkel-comforts-teenage-palestinian-asylum-seeker-germany ) ? 
  nazis were notorious with their plans and bureaucracy . 
  generalplan ost was the big scenario for the east which details the plans of mein kampf its the nazi ideology . 
  it 's the very core of their beliefs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost, 
  what the fuck is wrong with you guys that you prefer genocide of yourself and your people over dictatorship ? 
  it 's not about less facts , it 's about who is worse . 
  i 'll try another analogy to make my point . 
  if some guy breaks into your home and plans to murder you all but he ca n't because some other guy comes in and kicks him out . 
  then the other guy turns around and beats you up before he is kicked out by you ... 
  which of the guys is worse ? 
  that one that wanted to murder you but could n't achieve his plan or that one that hinidered the plans of the first one but beat you up ? 
  obviously both are bad people . . but i 'll take getting beat up all times instead of being murdered . 
  longer nazi rule would 've meant that the baltic people cease to exist - at all . 
  no , that he is alive . 
  if the soviets had n't `` liberated '' the east from the nazis , he would most certainly would have never existed because his parents/grandparents were murdered by the nazis . 
  i 'll take some mafia thug who kills and terrorize some people everytime over some terrorist who just wants to murder everyone , to make a metaphor . 
  nonetheless they planned to murder 50 % of estonians and latvians and 85 % of lithuanians . 
  the rest was to be enslaved in hard labour . 
  and no the russians didnt follow through , if they did you would have much people . 
  they were a brutal inhuman dictatorship but still lightyears better than the nazis . . 
  considering the nazis would habe genocided most of you and enslaved the rest i 'm not sure if liberated is the right term ... 
  yeah but at the same time this image is heavily distorted through right-wing media . . 
  here , you forgot this : / s, 
  no you 're not . 
  you can believe whatever crazy conspiracy you like . 
  read the fucking law before ranting about it . 
  hint : \u00a7 130 abs .3 starts with  ( 3 ) whosoever ** publicly or in a meeting ** approves of , denies or downplays defamation etc is also illegal in germany . 
  you ca n't just stand around and spout untrue factual assertions . 
  you can either proof what you say or you have to calm your tits . 
  no , for incitement to hatred . 
  if you think genocide should be legal you are an idiot . 
  like the far ? 
  and not much else ? 
  you spelled `` incitement to hatred '' wrong . 
   limited attempts  the weapon renders itself inoperable if an activation code is entered incorrectly multiple times . 
  this precludes attempts to bypass the pal codes through trial and error . 
  the weapon must be returned to a maintenance facility in order to work again . 
  that 's pretty much a kill switch . 
  either way there is no reason to remove them from incirlik except as a political signal . 
  from your other link :  a given pal can accept a number of different keys , permitting different groups of weapons to be unlocked with one transmission . 
  some keys are used for training ; others are used to disarm the weapon or to disable it . [ ... 
  ] there are a number of selectable mechanisms to disable the bomb . 
  in addition , there are `` violent or nonviolent methods for destroying the warhead or making it irreparably nonfunctional '', 
   almost as big as italy huh . 
  somehow i always thought you would be bigger than italy . 
   ber when ? 
  when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east . 
  when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves . 
  when your womb quickens again , and you bear a living child . 
  then it will be opened , and not before . 
  well . . given that [ this captain ] ( http://www.ksta.de/koeln/ns-parole-getwittert-koelner-afd-politiker-rottmann-wegen-volksverhetzung-angezeigt-26866776 ) from the military counterintelligence is a ) in the afd and b ) currently faces charges on volksverhetzung ( `` incitement to hatred '' ) ... 
   if it was n't for the over 26,000,000 ussr people that died fighting against hitler now we would probably live a different life , all of us . 
  no , probably not . 
  [ because you would probably be dead respectively never existed because most of your grandparents/parents were to be genocided . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost ), 
  why do they interlock the arms ? 
  i do n't suspect them to be attacked by police , so is there another reason ? 
  sure there is . . you just won the presidency , [ walk like it ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/070/279/leostrutoriginal.jpg ) . 
   without the possibility of some middle-easterner shooting you in the head . 
  i think thats not the big point but rather without getting commanded . 
  it sucks for families to either move every few years or having one parent live in the barracks in the week . 
  at least thats the impression that i get from ex-bw-soldiers/officers, 
  north korea too , 
  the biggest difference between afd and npd is that the afd is still trying to uphold a democratic facade . 
   the racist and bigoted voter base that brought her to that place ( and who believe she represents her interests ) well ... because she does ? 
  because if i want a green-painted cdu i can as well vote cdu the first time . 
  their traditional voter base are leftists , i do n't think replacing them with conservatives will do good as that voter spectrum is already catered to by cdu and spd . 
  the 2 % goal is completely arbritary .
