  `` lefties '' are one of the biggest critics of islam , but there 's a difference between criticizing salafism etc or `` muslims are inherently violent and bad , mkay ? 
  it 's in their nature !, 
  dae le religion of peace ? '', 
  depends , our afd goes that far in their day-to-day publications . 
  in talk-shows they back-pedal a bit to not come across as completely crazy/far from reality . 
  according to our right-wing newspapers ( ok , given they are basically far right-wing ) like sezession , compact ! , they believe that . 
   or you think that right-winger = neo-nazi , no , only a few a real neo-nazi but a good chunk of them shares a lot of ideological fragments with them . 
  well , it contradicts the right-wingers propaganda, 
   do the small states like bremen also have their own police force , or would they cooperate with nearby bigger states ? 
  they have their own landespolizei ( state police force ) . 
   does a big city in a larger state have another level of police force , like let 's say m\u00fcnchen in bayern for example . 
  does m\u00fcnchen have a city police force ? 
  depends on your definition and which state . 
  in some states each county/county-free city has it 's own police department , in others they are bundled together . 
  they are also further divided down into smaller regions . 
  all of them are organized in the landespolizei . 
  so , m\u00fcnchen has it 's own city police department ( polizeipr\u00e4sidium m\u00fcnchen ) , but the rest of bayern is divided into 9 police departments who have ~ 300 local police stations . 
  additionally there 's a central investigation department ( [ lka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landeskriminalamt ) ) and closed police units ( barracked ) for protests , football games and other big events ( [ bereitschaftspolizei ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bereitschaftspolizei ) ) . 
   railway police we got them , too . 
  they were called [ bahnpolizei ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bahnpolizei ) . 
  1992 they were incorporated into the [ bundesgrenzschutz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesgrenzschutz ) ( border police / originally auxiliary light infantry troops for the cold war ) which was then again reformed and renamed in 2005 into bundespolizei ( federal police ), 
  they are n't the brightest . . 
  based on kanariepietjes other comments that i remember he 's just an idiot and no troll . 
  as much as i 'm no fan of that celebration , it 's a magnitude worse with hobby-nazis all around shouting something about volksfahrr\u00e4der . 
  meddling in their affairs certainly was . 
  i imagine that the inventor of this abomination got shipped off to australia ? 
  he 's talking about right-wing murders and not attacks on refugee shelters . 
  that 's two different things . 
  also , the 70 count for murders are way too low it excludes things like e.g. 
  hartmut nickel who was murdered together with his wife and daughter by a `` committed member of the neonazi scene '' ( self description ) because `` all legal practitioner have to be exterminated '' and the murder were `` a self-operated measure for the recovery of the german nation '' . 
  or doris bott , who was murdered by a 19 year old neonazi as an introduction ritual for an thuringian neonazi organisation . 
  or thomas goretzky , yvonne hachtkemper and matthias larisch von woitowitz , three cops , who were murdered by a neonazi with affiliations to a forbidden neonazi organisation who promoted these kinds of actions . 
  or dieter klaus klein who was murdered by two neonazis because he complained about their loud `` sieg heil ! '', 
  or helmut sackers who was murdered by a neonazi because he complained about the playback of the horst-wessel-lied . 
  etc etc etc, 
   second is that antifa is not a homogeneous group yeah , but the responsibility claim that was posted on an anonymous direct-publish board ( which is known for lot of nazi troll posts ) was posted under the name of that group . 
  also , it has a very ( ! ), 
  untypical writing style and content for a leftist group . 
   antifa issued a statement claiming responsibility for it . 
  i no . 
  somebody posted a statement claiming responsibility on it under the name of an antifa group on an anonymous direct-publish site . 
  it 's like posting on 4 chan . 
  however the named antifa group denied responsibility in a statement and the statement has very ( ! ), 
  unusual form and content for a leftist statement . 
   i do n't know who does , neither do i know what the opinion of some ` right-wing fuckers ' has to do with this conversation . 
  because that 's the only group of people in germany that thinks anyone with a german citizenship but migrant background is no german . 
   or does everything that comes out of your mouth has to do with hitler , breivik or right-wing ? 
  only if it 's directly related to the topic . 
   to you it does , to others it does n't . 
  who the fuck cares what some right-wing fucker thinks about it . 
  he 's german according to german law and the majority of german people . 
  he self-identified as a german and his attack had a clear xenophobic target . 
  wikipedia , academic surveys , official statistics , news media not affiliated with political groups , agendas or yellow press etc ? 
  i mean come on . 
  if it were about anything else than islam would you really get your infos from such a website ? 
  if it were sports would you take your infos about team a from a website that 's basically called teamasucks.com ? 
  it 's far from a neutral source , already the name pushes the agenda . 
  if you want to persuade somebody you should n't use a ideologic website which sole purpose it is to push an agenda . 
  itt : right-wingers on damage control, 
   iranian with german citizenship which makes him a german . 
   article 116 basic law  ( 1 ) unless otherwise provided by a law , a german within the meaning of this basic law is a person who possesses german citizenship you know . . we discarded the notion that to be considered german you have to have several `` racial cleanse '' generations some years ago . 
  he glorified breivik and was proud to have the same birthday as hitler . 
  he shouted `` i am german '' and `` fucking turks ! '', 
  during the shooting . 
  http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/ what 's next ? 
  getting `` neutral infos '' about jews from mein kampf ? 
   right-wing terror  eh . 
  live your life . 
  the odds are miniscule . 
  9 people out of 80 million ... that 's ridiculously low odds . 
  9 people ? 
  more like 184 since reunification if you do n't count munich . 
  and 849 more suspected but no definitive proof that the right-wing ideology was the most defining motive . 
  and before reunification it was n't all peace and harmony either . 
  yesterday was the 36th anniversary of the [ oktoberfest attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oktoberfest_terror_attack ), 
  because climate change is a leftist conspiracy ? 
  can you quote him in that ? 
  i only see a comment that he is ( rightfully ) more worried about right-wing terror that islamistic terror . 
  [ list from last year ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_fl%c3%bcchtlingsfeindlicher_angriffe_in_deutschland_2015 ), 
  to what extreme right group was breivik connected ? 
  you could do right-wing terror attacks without beging connected . 
  david did targeted foreigners and shouted racist things . 
  you do know that the guy in munich was a german and targeted foreign-looking people while shouting racist things ? 
  edit : downvotes for facts !, 
  / r/europe at its best, 
  [ that looks like a boat that is n't boating anymore ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wcxlsxe.jpg ), 
  you may paste it . 
  but it still would n't make it a guide on hunting people . 
  it 's an article about how neonazis are infiltrating kinderg\u00e4rten . 
  a alt-right outlet trying to paint an article against neonazis as negative ? 
  color me surprised !, 
  which quote exactly is a `` hunting for people of the `` wrong '' political orientation . 
   i did n't read the actual article  it 's a guide on hunting for people of the `` wrong '' political orientation for fuck 's sake lol . 
  i mean . . 
  i am genuinely sorry that your feelings are hurt by that foundation , but it did a lot of good work . 
   $ 0.0085 / mb 8,7 $ / gb ? 
  still cheaper than normal rates in germany ... [ how much lte-traffic you get for 35 $ / month ] ( http://e4sy.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/deutschland-internet-mobile-daten-preis-vergleich-tabelle-europa.jpg ), 
   implying i 've got a choice if russia attacks the nato personally i 'm not even ready to die for germany ( wehrdienstverweigerer ) . 
  i do n't get why the difference between ukraine and baltics that hard to grasp for you guys . 
  it 's a very different risk-reward calculation for putin to attack any nato state .
