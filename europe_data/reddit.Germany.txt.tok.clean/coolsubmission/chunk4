  attacking a nation without any allies who turns to your rival power and constitutes a significant loss for you and your strategic position vs. attacking the current most powerful alliance of the world for ... domestic propaganda purposes ? 
  what strategic purpose would it have ? 
  ukraine was warm-water port and access to black sea as well as prevent a possible additional eu/nato presence on their direct border . 
  that 's why he took crimea as primary objective and tries to establish eastern ukraine as autonomous regions/puppet autonomous states . 
  the only reason i could see in current politics why he would attack the baltics states would be when the nato decides to build up a nuclear force there . 
   so they do n't fit the definition of migration background ( at least one parent born without german citizenship ) . 
  uuh . . just because your parents migrated to germany does n't mean that you were born with german citizenship . 
  so , yes even if the family is in 3rd generation in germany you are considered a migrant background by statistics . 
   is basically what they said about crimea , while is completely different , the rhetorics used are the same . 
  no , it is n't . 
  attacking nato and attacking a former ally/puppet state without allies is quite a difference . 
  putin is ruthless but he is n't trump . 
  there 's no incentive to conquer the baltics under current circumstances . 
  all that 's going on is some dick-measuring contest primarily for domestic politics reasons . 
  why should they ? 
  nato has no obligations in ukraine and it would set a bad precedent if they just engage in another country . 
  that 's not even a race in the common racist bullshit . 
  did you really invented a new level of this shit ? 
  like [ lutz bachmann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lutz_bachmann ) , founder of [ pegida ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pegida ) ? 
  spouting racist propaganda against `` drug dealers '' and `` criminal foreigners '' while having a past like . .  bachmann has a criminal record for sixteen burglaries , drunk driving , dealing cocaine [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and assault . 
  [ 13 ] in 1998 , after bachmann had been sentenced to several years in prison , he fled to south africa but was deported back to germany . 
  now after 1 + years of organizing the `` defense of germany '' against refugees and migration and propagating slogans `` who does n't love germany should leave germany '' . . he moves to teneriffa . 
  aaand which `` race '' do you think i belong to ? 
  careful , you might enslave yourself with that obedience . 
  to be more serious : it 's fucking stupid to say that protests should be easily ignored and made useless . 
  that 's just really ignorant and anti-democratic . 
  who needs silly protests ? 
  and not back again onto the field to work for your lord !, 
  or do i have to whip you again ? 
   but we can admit there are certain parts in some of western cities where it is difficult for indigenous population to go/chance of robbery , troubles , sexual assault and so on / we speak about some neighbourhoods where immigrants are in majority and it is not safe to go there if you are not from such neighbourhood . 
  lol . 
  sure thing bro . 
  yes , as i wrote . 
  it 's ok as long as it can be easily ignored and be rendered useless . 
  ah yes , the old `` protest is okay as long as it can be easily ignored '' . 
  as long as they are still such idiots like [ they shoot a video of themselves and publish it ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hozzroafk6y ) not the smartest move to publish the faces of fsb academy graduates . 
  ok , in all honesty : are you an officer who just wants to get some sun ? 
  lol . 
  that 's the dumbest thing i read all day, 
  well , petry ( the afd leader ) said that they [ want to rehabilitate a deeply racist term ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/afd-co-chair-petry-wants-to-rehabilitate-controversial-term/a-19543222 ) ( [ v\u00f6lkisch , a central term to the nazis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b6lkisch_movement ) ) , a state party leader [ held an extremely racist speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487wmxiraru ) , a state mp said that the jews are the inner enemy while the islam is the outer enemy of germany and that the [ the protocols of the elders of zion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protocols_of_the_elders_of_zion ) are legit . 
  none of that and much more had any real negative consequences . 
  no consequences from the rest of the party nor their voters . 
  they do n't . 
  but they are responsible for every refugee in germany and whether or not they should be deported . 
  and they wo n't send any as hungary is violating their human rights . 
   i also do not think hungary will agree to getting hundreds of thousands of people sent there also , german courts wo n't allow it because it violates the human rights of the refugees . 
  at least that 's the tenor of several court decisions . 
  if they do n't want it titled with `` rassistische ausschreitungen '' maybe they should stop shouting racist slogans , attacking people based on their looks and stop attacking ambulances who try to bring a refugee with laceration to the hospital . 
  nah , the afd has trump 's [ i could shoot somebody and not lose voters ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/01/23/donald-trump-iowa-rally-shooting-sot.cnn ) mode . 
  she said that they [ want to rehabilitate a deeply racist term ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/afd-co-chair-petry-wants-to-rehabilitate-controversial-term/a-19543222 ) ( [ v\u00f6lkisch , a central term to the nazis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b6lkisch_movement ) ) , a state party leader [ held an extremely racist speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487wmxiraru ) , a state mp said that the jews are the inner enemy while the islam is the outer enemy of germany and that the [ the protocols of the elders of zion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protocols_of_the_elders_of_zion ) are legit . 
  none of that and much more had any real negative consequences . 
  no consequences from the rest of the party nor their voters . 
  it 's quite scary . 
  in germany there are several leftist ultra groups and afaik there are also some in other countries . 
  yeah , but in this case because of their political views or not ? 
  ultras are not the same as racist etc. 
  there are left-wing as well as right-wing ultras groups , it 's just a form of organization/hobby/subculture . 
   i 'm a bit afraid that our ultras you mean your own xenophobes/right-wing nuts ? 
  ultras are a political diverse group . 
  there are no races so there is no racism anywhere . 
  top notch argument !, 
  and very true . 
  nazis in nadelstreifen . 
  how are they waging war against them by supporting them and murdering kurds ? 
  another more detailed first hand experience [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3jhazm/dear_germany/ ), 
  in the whole series there was no showing of a concentration camp . 
  the german ss-officer acted with a `` rational '' undertone to combat partisans : `` wo der jude ist , ist der partisan '' - `` where 's the jew , there 's the partisan '' . 
  meanwhile the polish resistance fighters have a typical irrational antisemitism and which can `` smell the jews '' ( nein , keine juden . 
  on top of that , the complete unrealistic combination of friends in an otherwise completely brainwashed generation ( the shown generation was the first to complete the ns - school system ) , unrealistic party in a time where viktor would n't had the chance to live that way and the evil ones are always the others . 
  not one of the protagonists did evil things because they thought it was right , they all were forced to do it . 
  it certainly has a white-wash feeling . 
  edit :  in fact , quite a few policemen and civil servants actively collaborated with the occupying forces , which is why a huge percentage of jews in the netherlands did n't survive the war . 
  was n't that because the netherlands conducted a census shortly before the war which , in contrast to other countries , included the religion ? 
  during the occupation the nazis seized this data and could find & deport the jews more easily than in other countries . 
  at least that 's the reason i 've always heard . 
   or that germany will repatriate them if not . 
  well , german authorities did it with balkan refugees from yugoslav wars . 
   all of the facts on which i based my analysis are correct . 
  simply no . 
   i would rather call them agenda press because that is more fitting . 
  :d oh hello there . 
  i 've got cheap tinfoil hats on sale . 
  are you interested ? 
  as a vivid customer , you 'll get a few percents off . 
  [ he does n't even need a lot of time :d ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgrmr.jpg ), 
  you do n't ? 
  some terror attacks and authoritarian state is far less worse than systematic genocide of a continent . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  edit : karl popper formulate it as such :  unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance . 
  if we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant , if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant , then the tolerant will be destroyed , and tolerance with them . 
  sure , i did n't said anything else . 
  yeah but harassing them isnt exactly so much better . 
  there 's much more to fascism than `` traditional values '' . 
  i agree that right-wing extremists and islamists have much more in common than they both are willing to admit . 
  but there are still some differences between islamism and fascism . 
   islamist does not mean terrorist . 
  no , it just means total fucking assholes . 
  and a subset of them are terrorists . 
  because it 's their [ name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) ?!, 
  why do canadians call themselves canadians ?
