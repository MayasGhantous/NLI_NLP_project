  like talking about things you know nothing about ? 
  yeah , i mean it should be clear that they are a whole other culture than the rest of france and much more closer to estonia . 
  you 're funny . 
  but sadly you do n't understand even simple things . 
  perhaps in a few years when you are older . 
  i 'm also glad that you 're not in europe , 
  well . . duh . 
  right-wing people \u228a assholes . 
  it 's a strict subset . 
  but some / r/the _ donald trumpet ... nah thanks . 
  i 'll try it simple : you have to deport 5000 people . 
  you can either deport 5000 refugees with an asshole quota of ~ 1 % or you can deport 5000 right-wing assholes with an asshole quota of 100 % now the question is : how do you make life more life-worthy with less assholes around in your daily life ? 
   are you a supporter of some kind of strange african/middle east/central asian lebensraum or something ? 
  you sure you did n't forget any medicine in the morning ? 
  does your tinfoil hat still fit ? 
  starting with people like you . 
  suddenly the idea gets much better . 
  you laugh but in my experience that 's the biggest reason why people learn spanish . 
  [ hmmm ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratlines_\\ ( world_war_ii_aftermath \\ ) ), 
   stalin also had plans for people , but he died and the atrocities committed in ussr dropped could you link them ? 
  never heard of any plans of stalin to exterminate half of europe . 
   why not take those plans as the nazi after world war view ? 
  because they abandoned them but they were acting on the other one . 
  it 's in their ideology . 
  hitler did n't joke when he talked about the `` vernichtung der j\u00fcdischen rasse in europa '' on january 30rd 1939 ( ! ) . 
   the nazis did n't win the war . 
  that 's it . 
  countless factors had to be different for nazis to have won the war and if those had been different we do n't know what kind of plans they would have had . 
  as i said i 'd much rather have neither soviet nor nazi occupation of eastern europe . 
  i 'm just sick of this downplaying of the nazis and their ideology when some blokes put the soviets or any other regime on a level with them . 
   what you are currently telling me is that one murderer who killed 10 is worse than the murderer who also killed ten people because the first one had plans to kill trillion people . 
  what i 'm telling you is that i 'd much rather be in a hostage situation where some of the hostages are murdered than in a hostage situation where the hostage takers want to kill everyone of the hostages ( although historically they do n't complete their plan because they are pre-maturely killed . ), 
  wtf ? 
  i 'm not apologizing any soviet crimes . 
  i just state that they were n't as bad as the nazis . 
  who talks about any excuse ? 
   you 're comparing what was on paper to what happened . 
  yeah , but they had already the explicit intent to murder them and the infrastructure . 
  they already murdered 11 million in just 6 years . 
  if the soviets were as bad as the nazis were there would n't anything to discuss because there would n't be any other eastern european states . 
   i 'm sure the su would have preferred more mass deportations as well . 
  can you show me the plans ? 
  never heard of them . 
  the nazis followed through with their plans . 
  to think that they would 've suddenly changed their mind after they 've won is incredibly naive . 
   and how many did n't live because instead of the nazis the soviets came to power ? 
  a shit-ton more survived , e.g. 
  the populations of the baltic states , poland , ukraine and many more states ,  one is historical fact the other is `` what if '' . 
  yeah , one is `` what if '' . 
  but it is n't an `` what if '' like `` what if hitler were killed 1939 '' . 
  it would have happened without any doubt if the nazis had won . 
  they had the death factories in place , they already killed in 11 million in 6 years , they had the explicit plan to murder them . 
  the soviets were as a matter of fact sadly the lesser of two evils . 
  plans were accurate and nazis demonstrated that their follow through with their genocidal plans . 
  ffs they killed ~ 200k lithuanian jews in ww2 . 
   \\ #sovietsdidnothingwrong !, 
  where the ** fuck ** did i say anything even remotely in that direction ? 
  go pull your strawman anywhere else . 
  yeah and you would n't live if the nazis remained in power . 
   they did the same shit at the same time . 
  soviet union did murder 85 % of polish citizens ? 
  til . 
  i get that , but that was n't the question . 
  i would 've also much rather see free baltic states after ww2 , but i 'd rather have them under soviet rule and their citizens mostly alive than under nazi rule and massacred , given that these were the two historical choices . 
  i get that you do n't feel thankful that the soviets conquered your country , but you should be glad that they did because that earned you the chance to complain about that now . 
  if they did n't had won , you would n't be here because the nazis would 've killed everyone of your family decades ago . 
  yes , i get that . 
  but you do n't seem to get what i meant . 
  freedom is n't some absolute thing , it 's gradual from total annihilation/oppression to total freedom . 
  technically ( as poachtwc ) said , they liberated because they brought shifted the freedom more towards `` total freedom '' . 
  however they only shifted it quite slightly and it resulted in decades of oppression . 
  as i said , if i had to choose between these two , i choose some violent oppressor over a genocidal oppressor . 
   false , soviets actually did more harm to local populations dude . 
  [ 85 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) of lithuanians were planned to be exterminated by the nazis . 
  the rest would 've been enslaved . 
  they just did n't had enough time to kill them all because the soviet army approached . 
  not really . 
  if you look on freedom as a gradual thing , than it is impossible . 
  i 'd rather live under soviet rule 40s-90s than [ be killed under nazi rule ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) . 
  the rest that does n't get exterminated would 've lived their live in ns-style slave-labour . 
  you can automatically count letters ... 
  i disagree with the german part . 
  the whole situation has nothing to do with `` guilt '' . 
  i do n't know why reddit and especially the right-wing part of reddit is so obsessed with `` german guilt '' . 
  nobody here thinks about any guilt . 
   talks about ` pc bullshit ' and ` libtards '  talks about bringing sanity back with a far-right politician ever thought about a career in comedy ? 
  202 letters of pure bullshit . 
  i 'm neither sarcastic not trolling . 
  attack on nato is suicide . 
  putin is n't stupid . 
  nuclear bombs in romania instead of turkey would n't really shift the power balance . 
  yeah , perhaps given enough time . 
  but if turkey would attack nato to gain nuclear weapons you can be pretty sure that it would n't have these weapons for long even if they achieved to get physical access . 
  ccsg-8 is at crete and would n't allow such a move . 
  hell , even russia would rather nuke inclircik than give erdogan access to nukes . 
  no , pal checks certain parameters . 
  you cant strap a b61 on a rocket and expect it to function as mrbm . 
  its incredibly naive to think russia would start a war over the stationing of nuclear weapons in romania . 
  [ the kangaroo ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_k%c3%a4nguru-chroniken ) hit the nail on the head regarding the difference between patriotism and nationalism :  healthy patriotism sounds a bit like - benign tumor . 
  not directly life-threatening , but it 's nonetheless a tumor .
