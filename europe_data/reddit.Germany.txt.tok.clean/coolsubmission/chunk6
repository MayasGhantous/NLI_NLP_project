  as the story that i linked showed , not everyone of them returned to bosnia or one of the other ex-yugoslavian countries . 
  i certainly trust these numbers . 
  tbh probably everyone who is n't an outright right-wing extremist is called a leftist by `` thenationalistt '', 
  if you mean by it that the two biggest parties were always [ one of the parties in the ruling coalition then yes . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundestag#list_of_bundestag_by_session ), 
  you have my vote . 
  finally less rain !, 
  ` wants ' ? 
  it succeeded . 
  just look over at / r/the _ drumpf . 
  all the idiots think europe is just a smoking hole in the ground . 
  [ schopenhauer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arthur_schopenhauer ) hit the nail on the head regarding patriotism :  the cheapest form of pride however is national pride . 
  for it reveals in the one thus afflicted the lack of individual qualities of which he could be proud , while he would not otherwise reach for what he shares with so many millions . 
  he who possesses significant personal merits will rather recognise the defects of his own nation , as he has them constantly before his eyes , most clearly . 
  but that poor blighter who has nothing in the world of which he can be proud , latches onto the last means of being proud , the nation to which he belongs to . 
  thus he recovers and is now in gratitude ready to defend with hands and feet all errors and follies which are its own . 
  nationalism is the even more extreme and irrational form . 
  nationalism is what brought us two world wars . 
  okily dokily / u/thenationalistt, 
  try to troll harder . 
  it 's [ not the first time germany cared for lot of refugees ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/graphics/d27_2v_d.gif ) ( - / - immigrants ) and frankly , it was a similar heated atmosphere back then . 
  [ arguably ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostock-lichtenhagen_riots ) the [ right-wing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solingen_arson_attack_of_1993 ) reacted even more like [ right-wing extremists ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoyerswerda_riots ) . 
  although back then the cdu fueled the nazi extremists violence and exploited it for their restricted [ asylum politics ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/asyldebatte ) . 
  after the conflict cooled down , [ the main part of refugees went back ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/graphics/d27_2bv_d.gif ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3jhazm/dear_germany/ ) 's an comment of one of the refugees from back then . 
  but i 'm sure you know all that in your endless wisdom . 
  the fact that you call the current asylum policy `` liberal extremism '' tells anything i need to know about your stance . 
  nice username . 
  tbh , it would 've been a bit overreacted to even send a single carrier group . 
  and it was n't really ceuta/melilla but an uninhabited island . 
  as ceuta/melilla and the canary islands are part of spain and eu/nato the reaction would 've been different . 
  therefore there are nato soldiers stationed there . 
  to provide losses to other nato members . 
   what does spain owe to latvia to do such a sacrifice ?!, 
  the nato . 
  literally . 
  without reaction in that case it would break apart . 
  which is why everyone will react . 
  yeah , very toothless while several times overpowering [ russia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ip8ctaw.gif ) . 
  turkey alone has more artillery than russia and slightly less tanks . 
  eu together has much more power and a magnitude of industrial power more than russia . 
  and then there 's still the us . 
  and that 's all under the presumption that somehow all nuclear weapons are demolished which would render an russian attack on nato as suicide . 
  it 's one thing to attack georgia and ukraine who has no allies and a military and industry which ca n't match russia . 
  it 's a whole another level to attack a nato country . 
  putin is ruthless but he is n't insanely stupid . 
  that does n't seem to be a good idea for morocco . 
  0/10 troll would n't read again . 
  why would he ? 
  `` everybody out of here/everyone run away ! '', 
  literally `` everyone away here '', 
  man , can you people do n't just cease to try to paint it as an islamist attack ? 
  it 's not . 
  apparently someone shouted `` alle weg hier '' which someone took as allahu akbar in the stress . 
  witness accounts are notorious unreliable when the witnesses are under stress . 
  especially considering the video where the attacker basically confirms it 's a shooting spree and the police saying they think it 's an amok situation and no terror attack . 
  haha , sure thing bro :d go smoke something else, 
  it 's rather a question of wars . 
  having an eu army whose purpose and only purpose is to defend the eu ? 
  fine . 
  having an eu army whose purpose is to intervene at every little conflict ? 
  nah man , i do n't wan na have a us military 2.0, 
  source ? 
  14 warships ? 
  because kohl was an average politician who did merely * okay * while kant is a big philosopher ? 
  also , no leibniz on your list ? 
   i think it can be kinda misleading to see history only through `` great men '' , but you could include many other figures ( especially if you 're not so strict about the borders or even the idea of the modern national state ) , such as and that it is a retarded popularity contest at that time . 
   15 daniel k\u00fcblb\u00f6ck , singer ( born 1985 )  16 konrad zuse , computer inventor ( 1910 -- 1995 ) any list that has daniel k\u00fcblb\u00f6ck above konrad zuse can be considered bullshit . 
  you mean the ones who are n't currently working on walls for us border patrol/frontex etc ? 
  and north korea thinks of itself as a democratic republic . 
  doesnt mean its true . 
  its not natural science but its social science . 
  yeah , but it also applies there . 
  marx was n't a politician . 
  junge freiheit isnt the counterpart of taz . 
  that would be more the welt . 
  junge freiheits counterpart would rather be idk junge welt or something . 
  we dont really have a 1:1 counterpart on the left side which functions as link between social democracy and left wing extremism as junge freiheit does it with conservatism and right-wing extremism . 
  you forgot : hurr durr, 
  ah yes , the good old burn-cars-in-berlin-day . 
  which decade again was the last time that there 's was a burning car in 1st may in berlin ? 
  was it 00 or 90s ? 
  logic doesnt apply . 
  hitler was elected . 
  and by integrate you mean assimilate ... ? 
  ~ 55 ( 2015 ) , ~ 140 ( 2016 ) were a target of arson attacks . 
  burned down remains on the definition of it . 
  does it count as burned down if it 's unhabitable due to grime and other side products of the fire ? 
  lol , u serious ? 
  do you expect us not to laugh if you vote a clown into office ? 
   the only thing that has changed is the 24/7 news cycle and the perpetuation of an incident over the course of days . 
  i think much more important is the kind of news coverage . 
  in the past you got some text / news anchor who tells you n people are dead in terrorist attack and you get some pictures of ambulances and a official spokesperson . 
  now you get a ( social media ) video of the attack itself , live streams , reaction videos of people in the attacked crowd , graphic images etc. 
  it 's much more fear-inducing if you get a news coverage as if you basically were there by yourself . 
  austrian german is a weird language . 
  we always called them flugzeuge . 
   until they are identified as refugees , they are a foreign invader who is potentially armed and dangerous . 
  lol . 
  i do n't even know to start as you are so wrong .
