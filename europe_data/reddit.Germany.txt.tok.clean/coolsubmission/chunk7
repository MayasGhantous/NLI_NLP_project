  this sentiment is only correct if it 's about military personnel as refugees e.g. 
  from turkey in the last months . 
  other than that ? 
  it 's just bullshit \u00b3 . 
   but there are some very beneficial uses for a militarized domestic force ) . 
  not more than they already do . 
  they can help and provide logistics by catastrophic events etc. 
  but they are n't for domestic security issues . 
  it 's a police job and i do n't see in which scenario we would need the army . 
   the dutch and the belgium navy have already kind of shared ships [ dutch and germans also ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hnlms_karel_doorman_\\ ( a833 \\ ) ) also , there 's apparently a cooperation between [ danish and german navies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_danish_navy#vessels )  in addition , the royal danish navy and the german navy are in cooperation in the `` ark project '' . 
  this agreement made the ark project responsible for the strategic sealift of danish and german armed forces where the full-time charter of three roll-on-roll-off cargo and troop ships are ready for deployments . 
  furthermore , these ships are also kept available for the use of the other european nato countries . 
  `` photorealistic '' it 's a nice game . . but far from photorealistic, 
  yeah , we already got the answers of the right . 
  gladfully , it ended 1945 . 
  nah , they build farms to harvest that wind . 
  dude , read the article !, 
  maybe we should use the money on education . 
  that way i probably have to read less bullshit like your comments . 
  and sometimes people forget how powerful the eu actually is regarding economics . 
  nobody wants a trade war in europe , but if trump escalates it will lead to reprisal actions . 
  i think he has the missile gap in mind, 
  and that being ... ? 
  migration ? 
  `` sovereignity '' ? 
  do you believe the economic problems will outweight your desired effects ? 
  do you believe brexit will achieve your desired effects ? 
   they all belong to a certain ethnic group you think that 's a defining attribute on whether a antifa group `` fuck someone up '' ? 
  maybe they decided it more because that someone are neonazis . 
  you know , these guys whose ideological fathers have murdered millions upon millions based on their ethnic group/religion/etc ... you know , neonazis , the guys that walk around and e.g. 
  killed 180 + ( and ~ 840 more suspected ) people in germany since reunification . 
  you know , the guys whose ideology can be described in a nutshell as genocide . 
  and by `` opposition '' you mean neonazis . 
  still a bunch of fascist shitheads . 
  i * should * have been for hate speech . 
  sadly hate speech and inciting hatred is endorsed on this website . 
  why ? 
  i seriously do n't understand that sentiment . 
  or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotenburg_an_der_w%c3%bcmme ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rothenburg,_saxony-anhalt ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotenburg_an_der_fulda ) ... 
  yeah , but only for eu citizens . 
  frontex is arbritrary as fuck and deny people from outside the eu their rightful ( visa and such ) entry for little to no reasons . 
  [ thanks schulz !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq2rpklhjmm ), 
  and i 'm sure your fascist propaganda outlet at least provided some semi-source . 
  while they are quite similar ideology-wise , there are accounted under islamic extremism and not far-right extremism . 
   look at these huge rehabilitation programs everywhere . 
  europe 's reoffending rates are n't much better than america 's , so the reason for continuing and expanding these programs is moral-political or ideological-political rather than practical-political . 
  mind to link a study ? 
  everyone that i 've seen points to the opposite . 
   and look at the way we 've decriminalized so much that used to be illegal over the last few decades , and how we 've enshrined many progressive ideals in law ( gay marriage , equality of opportunity , even some equality of outcome , and a whole host of treaties and laws based on the notion that `` we are all equals and racism is a grave sin '' ) . 
  yeah . 
  because human rights , you know ? 
  meanwhile , we 've implemented a proto-surveillance state in most of europe . 
  far-right politicians introducing one harsher law after the next one . 
  in germany , asylum laws are becoming more and more strict every few months . 
  and we 've basically already abolished our asylum right in the 90s . 
  the current intake of refugees was based on the need to liften the burden on the balkan states and because our christian conservative party for once rediscovered their christian roots as in `` christian love/charity '' . 
  also , we do n't have gay marriage in germany ... 
  counties are more comparable to kreise i 'd say . 
  kommunen are municipalities or however its spelled . 
   immigration and law and order wat ? 
  it 's quite big in turkey . 
  i wonder if he has more money after the presidency than before . 
  one one hand you got the blatant corruption in his favour , otoh his worth was mainly based on trump as trademark . 
  and that trademark is poisoned now . 
  if he gets at least one bomb in one oft his facilities anywhere , even his supporters might think twice about it . 
  oh , we 're gon na be replaced ? 
  when does the bus comes to get me ? 
  do you have already a date when you will be deported/executed ? 
  yes , but that does n't mean that they are replacing `` us '' . 
  also , `` breed '' is [ used for animals ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/breed ) , not humans ( at least if you do n't want to be derogatory ) . 
  i 'll give you the benefit of doubt that you did n't know that . 
  why?how about you clarify what you meant by that sentence ? 
  oh , i thought we are in 19th century race theories . 
  really ? 
   the migrants probably will take care of the elders but not in the way the elders would like to . 
  maybe i 've just read too much of alt-right bullshit , but that 's pretty close to their typical narrative of `` germany is going down in a civil war / sharia-law in germany / islamification of germany '' . 
  `` not in the way elders would like to '' implies that it 's in a hostile way that they take care of them . 
  are you ? 
  you think we need another wall ? 
   by third world migrants who breed at a much faster rate than us . 
  yeah , i mean just measure their skulls !, 
  they should n't do so ! ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  or just . . raise the wages ? 
  would help our trade surplus , too . 
  ah , since you seem to know the future , do you mind to give me some lottery numbers and stock prices ? 
  otherwise i just take it for the cheap right-wing propaganda that it is . 
  amen . 
  well , it 's daily mail and breitbart after all ...

  i do n't like assange , but solitary confinement over a long period is torture .
