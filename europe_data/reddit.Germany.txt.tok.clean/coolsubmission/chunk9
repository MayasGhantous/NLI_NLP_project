  trader joe 's is a seperate company owned by the same family trust that owns aldi nord . 
  sure they do . 
  at least if you exclude super-rich . 
   it is not just that their products are inferior ( they are ) it is that the whole experience of shopping there is dedicated to making you feel poor . 
  i disagree . 
  afd is no right wing party . 
  they are right-wing extremists . 
  and no . 
  germany doesnt need them . 
  we alrrady habe right wing parties, 
  [ calling for more lebensraum while defending holocaust deniers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eghsvrwhmi ) , [ saying that we were driven into ww2 by the polish ] ( http://www.rbb-online.de/kontraste/archiv/kontraste-27-10-2016/reichsbuerger-gedankengut_in_der_afd__.html ) , [ desire to rehabilitate a deeply racist term ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/afd-co-chair-petry-wants-to-rehabilitate-controversial-term/a-19543222 ) , [ doing an extremely racist speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=487wmxiraru ) , wishing for [ `` a thousand years of germany .

  dailymail and bild are newspapers . 
  crappy , playing with sex , fear and unsubstantiated `` news '' to boost sales . 
  but breitbart is a propaganda outlet of a protofascist movement . 
  `` open borders '' let the attack happen ? 
  good to know that you know more than the police about the attacker . 
  care to explain how you have insider knowledge ? 
  it is n't a `` buzzword '' if it describes accurately . 
  but yeah , we are going to need it . 
  against [ people that use `` marxist multiculturalism '' non-ironically ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_norway_attacks ) . 
  people like you . 
   get it together mate - ~ ~ rest of the developed world ~ ~ protofascists i guess you are talking about yourself , so i corrected your sentence . 
  wtf ? 
  well , [ he died the latest in the attack ] ( http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20161219&amp;t=2&amp;i=1166037108&amp;w=&amp;fh=&amp;fw=&amp;ll=780&amp;pl=468&amp;sq=&amp;r=lynxmpecbi16h ) . 
  but there 's also the possibility that he died beforehand and was just still in the truck . 
  time will tell . 
   amnesty might not like it , but some people need to be kept off the streets forever . 
  which is also possible with chance of parole . 
  parole is for those who do n't need to be kept off the streets forever . 
   german laws do n't invalidate human rights and the un refugee convention . 
  people who are eligible for refugee status can not be deported outside of very few and very special circumstances . 
  committing crimes in your host country is not such a case . 
  sure it is . 
  \u00a7 53 abs . 
  3 & \u00a7 54 abs . 
  it simply isnt ethnic cleansing . 
  saying so is a slap in the face of every people who really endured ethnic cleansing . 
   `` ethnic cleansing through immigration '' that 's neonazi ideology . 
  because nazi ideology is n't a valid opinion . 
  thanks !, 
   i mean , how long would it take to france , that is 60 % nuclear powered to make more nukes ? 
  if they see a dire need ? 
   around 11 metric tons of plutonium may be possessed by japan alone , with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in britain and france . 
  this is probably enough to make 6,000 atomic bombs . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  [ in september 2007 the french president nicolas sarkozy offered germany to participate in the control over the french nuclear arsenal . 
  chancellor merkel and foreign minister steinmeier declined the offer however , stating that germany `` had no interest in possessing nuclear weapons '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#cold_war_and_beyond ), 
   i mean i do n't agree with him but what the hell gives you the right to call him a nazi ? 
  hm let 's see ... him perpetuating nazi ideology ? 
   `` ethnic cleansing through immigration '', 
  anders breivik wrote a lot of bullshit on a long day . 
  careful now , the last two dudes with funny hair did serious shit this year . 
  do n't buying into racist theories does n't mean i 'm guilty of historical nazi actions . 
  oh we playing stereotypes now ? 
  fine . 
  gim me back my money . 
  you said you went to school in berlin ? 
  what you are perpuating is the idea of `` volkstod '' campaign of german neonazis . 
  the lunatic idea of a `` genocide by migration '' . 
  so , please . 
  take your bullshit , and go shove it back down the ass of your favorite little nazi leader where it came from . 
  wow . 
  and nothing learned apparently . 
   take a walk in berlin bwahahaha dude . 
  maybe come over to berlin . 
  but only if you promise to quit your bullshit . 
  why are you so ready to tolerate nazi bullshit ? 
  fun fact : the new vp of usa is a big proponent of these ` therapies ', 
  it 's an ancient language of some weird mountain tribe . 
  nah , reading is fine . 
  it 's just that i seldom read things that are lingering with colonial racism . 
  but i agree , the `` huge violent hordes outside the first world '' are a nice boogeyman . 
  wow . 
  mind = blown / s then they have no right to asylum , they have the possibility to grant asylum . 
  also , is n't canadas system about migration and not refugees ? 
  a right with a cap is like a dark sun . 
  it 's impossible per definition . 
  you can do introduce caps , but then it ca n't be called a right anymore . 
  yeah , and they do n't give easy access to labour market , citizenship or normal social services . 
  they are tighten every few years and are down to an unrecognizable ruin of the laws in the 80s with any real pressure , just to satisfy the far right . 
  you are by far the most uncivilized person . 
  racism like it 's 1933 . 
  wtf did i just read ? 
  not really , it 's rather universal truth . 
  a right is per definition abolished if you limit it to only a subset of people who would be eglible to that right . 
  it ceases to exist as a right and remains as a granted privilege . 
  it 's quite simple semantics . 
  we dont have to ensure the rights of the whole world , just of those who apply and are granted asylum . 
  thing is you ca n't put a cap in a right if you want it to remain a right . 
  it then becomes a privilege . 
  tl ; dr : fuck human rights . 
  sure you can do that . 
  but than it 's still not a basic right anymore . 
  you can also constitutionly abolish it by altering the constitution . 
  but then you should imo be at least as honest to call it by its name . 
  applying for asylum is . 
  but thats apparently the same for the right wing .
