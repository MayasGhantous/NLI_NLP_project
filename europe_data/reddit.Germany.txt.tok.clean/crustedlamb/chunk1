islam is a dangerous ideology to literally every liberal european value like [ ... ] freedom of religion . 
  ca n't make this shit up . 
  stay frosty , / r/europe . 
  you mean like the fdp did ? 
  and then the csu/afd talked about how `` people do n't want more immigration '' ? 
   she said that all syrian refugees are welcome , there is no limit of how many you will take . 
  that 's just stating the obvious though . 
  also no country has a limit on how many people can claim asylum . 
  weak strawman , bud . 
   so she saved all other 27 countries by inviting the hord and then trying to shove quotas ? 
  that 's not what happened though , she precisely suspended dublin because it was n't working anymore and precisely because countries were struggling . 
  if she did n't suspend dublin all the refugees would just have gotten sent back to italy/austria/hungary / greece/and the balkans . 
  this is also exactly what even the article you used to base your claim on states . 
  that 's also as i said above something even the big-eared goofball from austria said . 
  she `` invited '' the ones who were already inside the eu . 
  like the ones stranded in hungary . 
  i mean , who the fuck even brokered the deal with turkey ? 
  yeah ... it was merkel because all of the eu always relies on mommy to sort things out . 
   then media spreaded lies that all migrants are doctors and engineers wrong . 
  also pretty sure that the media you read is not german . 
   who will boost german economy straight to the moon to the moon is an overstatement but it is factually correct that they boost the economy . 
  even for a retard like you it should be clear that more money being spent = economy boosted . 
   that they all want to work wait , i thought they are economic immigrants ? 
  did your narrative just get interrupted ? 
   they will help fighting isis what the fuck does this even mean . 
  who the fuck would care and where the fuck would you have read that . 
  what the actual fuck . 
   and when they saw how easy its to come - they ( surprise ) started to come !, 
  yeah , it 's easy because none of you shitheads protect the eu border . 
  but we already know that no european country is able to get anything done without having mommy merkel come by in person to fix your fucking problems . 
   and what solidarity do you want , your mutti welcomed them to your country , why others have to pay for her decisions ? 
  it was originally the problem of a few `` chosen '' countries ( italy/greece/bulgaria / spain ) who got fucked by the dublin agreement . 
  do you think it 's fair that about 5 countries do the dirty work and you little shits just leech on our teat ? 
  what solidarity do you expect in return ? 
  what 's the point of a union if only a small minority actually puts in some work ? 
  what exactly has your country contributed to the eu ? 
  why the fuck are you still in the eu or even joined it in the first place ? 
  yeah ... for the germoneys   agreement with turkey dramatically reduced their number - why this agreement wasnt made in august ? 
  because these kinds of agreements ca n't be done overnight . 
  as a matter of fact i highly doubt that it would have happened in the first place without merkel or germany helping you little shits out . 
   so dont try to play innocent or fucking saviors why not ? 
  the only reason the eu did n't collapse is germany . 
   if not your mutti - this could be solved very quickly . 
  yah , i am sure the leaders of whatever shithole you are from are super capable . 
   instead , she created a real crisis . 
  and that 's where you are wrong , kiddo . 
  now some food for thought . 
  if everyone else is against the relocation system , why did the [ majority agree ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/2015-09-22_eu_jha_council_majority_vote_to_relocate_120%2c000_refugees.svg/702px-2015-09-22_eu_jha_council_majority_vote_to_relocate_120%2c000_refugees.svg.png ) why did any refugees come or try to come before merkel `` invited them '' ? 
  why the fuck did your , the international media , blast that `` invitation '' in the first place and actually made out of `` if those refugees currently stranded in hungary want to come , we will not stop them '' a `` merkel invites all of the world to germany '' ? 
  do you think the refugees all speak german and listened to mommy merkel speak ? 
  why the fuck is the eu border not either the responsibility of all eu countries and also the special responsiblity of whatever country the border belongs to ? 
  how many outer-eu borders does germany have again ? 
  why is it merkel 's fault that macedonia opened its border ? 
  fuck off now . 
   but our polling institutes are mainly financed by the major globalist merkel party . 
   they manipulated even the election 2013 . 
   where the afd got only exact 4,9 % die afd hatte aber 4.7 % . 
   the biased msm support their globalist candidate . 
   most if not all polling agencies have a left leaning bias funny you mention that , [ the boss of this one in particular ( insa ) has close ties to the afd . 
  ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_binkert#verh.c3.a4ltnis_zur_.e2.80.9ealternative_f.c3.bcr_deutschland.e2.80.9c ) also looking at recent state elections the afd underperformed in all of them . 
  [ polls having them at 22/23 % ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/landtage/mecklenburg-vorpommern.htm ) [ result : 20.8 % ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/news/2016/landtagswahl-mecklenburg-vorpommern-2016.html#sitzverteilung )  vibes i 'm getting from the germans i know . 
  how the fuck do you even quantify percentages based on `` vibes '' . 
  but you are the one who started rambling ? 
  literally the first line of your rant is wrong . 
   she said everybody can come and the next thing you say is indeed true , but supports my claim that germany saved all of your butts . 
   stopped dublin agreement . 
  and the rest is all something that ** you ** have to actually back up with facts . 
  wow . 
  calm down , child . 
  let 's turn it down a notch . 
  answer to what ? 
  hmm , you could literally scroll up and read the above comments again . 
   `` for me , the new germany exists only in order to ensure the existence of the state of israel and the jewish people . '', 
  i highly doubt that he said or meant that as it would not make a whole lot of sense . 
  what the fuck even is a `` pro uk thread '' ? 
  do you need some cheerleading ? 
  what exactly do you want ? 
  well , pretty much everything you said is simply false . 
  i am not even sure how i 'm supposed to argue with someone who distorts the factual situation based on his feelz . 
   eu technocrat he 's the opposite of a technocrat . 
   who does n't listen to its people . 
  well , the social-democrat base seems to be fairly happy with him . 
   support from the polling stations . 
  what ? 
  the cdu is a moderate center party . 
  please explain to me how on earth are they going to be part of the government . 
  and please explain to me why in the polls for recent state elections were more or less accurate . 
  like what the fuck are you basing your claims on ? 
  why ? 
  i 'm not a spd fan , but i am pretty sure that germany would remain pretty kewl , even with a spd led government . 
  i 'm pretty sure no one is planning to make poldi chancellor . 
  what ? 
  what are you trying to tell me , bud ? 
   are you dumb or what ? 
  dunno , but at least i am not the one trying to revise history . 
  well , the council agreed to the relocation and it consists of the very governments who later did n't actually follow through . 
   ust looking at brexit and the amount of vitriol shown even in this sub against random brits makes me fearful of throwing it all to shit and having this attitude spread out continent-wide . 
  ahh , i guess we will have to just accept that the rest of the eu is a bunch of baby-snakes and we just solve their problems for all eternity . 
  great .
