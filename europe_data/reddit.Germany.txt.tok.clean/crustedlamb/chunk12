  it 's not really my fault you ca n't differentiate between a lung disease and suffocating . 
  but that 's / r/europe for you i guess . 
  is n't the main point of the article that the general population including the media does n't have any clue ? 
  i personally always found translations from english to german in german newspapers more accurate than translation from german to english in anglo-media . 
  take the whole `` merkel invites refugees '' for example . 
   britain does have a coterie of multilingual experts ( mostly diplomats ) who knew this would n't fly . 
  but precisely because these people understand european thinking , they are distrusted by westminster and the tabloids . 
  the initial question was whether the us started the afghanistan war though . 
  and the 2001 afghanistan war was started by the us . 
  and the soviet backed sandpeople did n't play a real role since 93 while the sunni-islamists who were backed by the us are the main troublemakers . 
  pretending like soviet union is responsible for the 2001 war is the baltic bite reflex and american `` didn do nuttin wrong , just helpin ' peepols ! '', 
  attitude . 
  it is hypocrisy to me at the very least . 
  or it 's like shooting yourself into your foot . 
  but i guess that 's part of the us-american culture ? 
  well , it was the responsibility of the us , saudi arabia and pakistan . 
  if you did n't want to stabilize afghanistan you should n't have poured fuel into the fire . 
  it 's also not about whether it is possible or whether it would have been possible in the 90 's , it is about responsibility . 
  and isaf was a us-led-and initiated failure . 
  it is thereby fair to say that the us start the 2001 afghanistan war . 
  and why exactly did the us go into afghanistan in the 2001 's ? 
  how did the poor sandpeople suddenly grasp the attention of uncle sam ? 
  right , because the freedom fighters had turned terrorist and the us was `` under attack '' and the talibs suddenly were n't cool anymore and apparently afghanistan suddenly needed stabilization . 
  operation cyclone never happened . 
  the us is the good one . 
  stabilizing factor . 
  promoting freedom . 
  repeat after me . 
  [ the men in this picture are freedom fighters , not terrorists !, 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_afghanistan-pakistan_region_in_february_1983.jpg/1920px-reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_afghanistan-pakistan_region_in_february_1983.jpg ) [ mohammed omar did n't turn from freedom fighter to terrorist . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohammed_omar ) if in doubt , bring up nazis , that always works as an argument . 
  well , i wonder what exactly would have happened if russia was funding taliban in afghanistan to prevent it from becoming westernized and another satellite state . 
  it also makes no sense to blame the soviet union or russia for isaf . 
  if the us was interested in stabilizing afghanistan they had the chance to do so in the 90 's , but after the evil russians were gone the brave freedom fighters were just left with the rubble . 
  ignorance is bliss i guess . 
  fucking commies , thanks for spreading the freedom and liberal western values , yankees !, 
  some of them probably . 
  but as i said above , they should both be replaced by renewables . 
  yeah the us never armed mujahideen or praised them as freedom fighters as long as they focused their suicide bombings on soviets and osama bin laden was never a mujahideen . 
  nothing happened !, 
  no idea what `` i saw american fighting '' means and what you are trying to tell me . 
  both his foreign and defense secretary and the senate seem to disagree with him though . 
  i 'm willing to make the bet we are going to see business as usual when it comes to us policy on rossija and nato . 
  i mean during the soviet-afghan-war the us propped up the nice gentlemen around osama bin laden as `` freedom fighters '' . 
  as soon as the freedom fighters did n't just bomb russians , but turned against the us they suddenly became `` terrorists '' . 
  also the afghanistan `` war '' was an absolute failure of the nato and i highly doubt isaf would have been a thing without the us . 
  the us at the very very least poured a ton of oil into the fire . 
   replacing nuclear with renewables and leaving coal is the same as replacing coal with renewables and then replacing the nuclear with coal . 
  that does n't make any sense and it 's also not the same . 
  well , you did talk shit and pretended like mommy said things she never said . 
  also there is zero blame on germany . 
  but not better than or equal to renewables which is what you implied . 
   i mean leftist support muslims who think gays should be killed ... way to build a strawman !, 
  yeah , there is a big difference . 
  outside of reddit nuclear energy is not just rainbows and unicorns . 
  okay , mr. russian front yard . 
  there 's also moderate parties you know . 
  there is also [ this nice fella ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kay_nerstheimer ) i am sure jews , gays and other minorites would really love a v\u00f6lkisch society . 
  it would have been better to replace coal with renewables and get rid of the nucular later , but people on reddit always seem to pretend that the nucular is being replaced with coal , which is n't true . 
  guess it fortifies the nucular circlejerk . 
  [ coal usage did n't really rise though ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/energiemix_deutschland.svg/800px-energiemix_deutschland.svg.png ), 
  that 's what i said . 
  no one is suffocating . 
  cancer and lung diseases would happen way before suffocating though and even if we increased coal usage no one would suffocate . 
  it is as long as you do n't need water i guess . 
  that 's sadly not how it works . 
  well , you are part of the eu though and it was certain countries doing nothing . 
  you also tried to shift the blame on germany which is delusional . 
  it 's partly your fuckup , not merkel 's . 
   and now please tell me a law/policy a politician can pass that would reduce the trade surplus . 
  the suggestions are basically a higher minimum wages and more investments , anything that ends up with more consumption , but the big thing that would theoretically reduce the export surplus would be a currency that is n't undervalued . 
  and a decent amount of eu countries somewhere in the south run an illegal deficit and have been threatened by the eu with sanctions , but they do n't get enforced either . 
   instead of keeping them in the border countries and offering help which is what germany did until it obviously did n't work anymore because greece and italy and bulgaria and hungary could n't handle it anymore . 
  and that was the moment the rest of the eu , including the uk , did n't do anything while germany helped . 
  then germany went to the eu and said that it 's not fair that the burden is just on the shoulders of a few . 
  [ let 's take a look : who wanted a eu-solution and solidarity ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/eu_immigration_quota_plan_map.svg/2000px-eu_immigration_quota_plan_map.svg.png ), 
   italy and greece have been trying to stop refugees coming in , patrolling the seas and rescuing people , not encouraging them to turn up . 
  lol . 
   the hell are you talking about , germany has taken more refugees than anyone else , and flat out said they wo n't be turned away , prompting waves of refugees to pass straight through other countries to germany . 
  i do n't understand how someone can be that thick . 
  it 's not like germany suddenly decided `` whoopsie we gon take all de refutschis from afriga !!! '' . 
  they were already in europe and the pull effect only exists in the fantasies of some eurotrashbags who ca n't and wo n't ever take responsibility for their own problems . 
  germany saved the eu at least temporarily by not completely fucking everyone over by just deporting everyone back to where they first entered the eu . 
  period . 
  stop trying to rewrite history . 
  germany did n't bring anyone though . 
  italy , greece and hungary are schengen countries too . 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  is this supposed to be `` british humour '' ? 
   the suspension of the 1990 dublin protocol never happened saving italy , greece , hungary and bulgaria from drowning in refugees indeed did happen . 
  btw you yourself talked about how the eu left them alone , germany did n't . 
   germanys ` welcome culture ' is n't a thing ? 
  is an expression from the nineties and is an integration concept . 
  hardly an invitation . 
   merkles contribution was when she went out and said refugees are welcome in europe she never said that you dingus and it 's merkel , not merkle . 
  british `` media '' did a decent job on you . 
  well and here i was thinking the uk does n't want to be a german satellite state . 
  yet the eu is apparently entirely germany 's responsibility and we are just going to ignore that `` merkle '' never said `` everyone is welcome '' or that germany is the only reason the eu did n't collapse because everyone else was trying to do their best to avoid any responsibility for the refugees that were already inside europe and everyone wanted to play hot potato with it . 
  the only countries that did anything in terms of refugees were greece and italy because they were forced to due to their geographic location and germany and sweden .
