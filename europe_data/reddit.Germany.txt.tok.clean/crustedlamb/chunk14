  also refugees = migrants , but do n't call another yuropean or yank a migrant because they are expats . 
  i am sure we will also see well written comments about why the improper handling of fireworks is a muslim tradition . 
  oh also citizens of `` northern '' countries ca n't have black hair !, 
  they are not ** real ** swedes if they do n't have blue eyes and blonde hair !, 
  obviously white genocide !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ wakeupsheeple, 
  people improperly handling fireworks is a thing in germany too . 
  yeah it does . 
  do n't you have fireworks in the ukraine ? 
  that looks like a normal nye on a random western european street to me tbh . 
  lol !, 
  i just wanted to express that i thought this is a funny joke , my dearest / u/serendipityquest . 
  i guess we call them mey-meys nowadays ? 
  yes !, 
  lmao, 
  lol . 
  you might , i do n't . 
  and the kind of parties that use agitation as their main tool do n't either . 
   our society our ? 
  you are a foreigner too . 
   set up un camps in safe zones of the middle east , properly vet refugees , allow them to come to europe in other words let others handle it . 
  is n't that already what the rest of the eu is doing ? 
   any violation of the law means permanent expulsion from europe for them and their families . 
  you can do that in scotland or the uk , but guilt by association is not a german , european or western value . 
  c u, 
  see , you obviously did n't understand my previous comments . 
  i added something new/you did n't understand to the conversation . 
  contrary to this very comment of yours i am replying to . 
  there is n't though . 
  and even if there was , the anti-russia/turkey/us / germany circlejerks are all bigger . 
  every thread that is n't a pro-queen-elizabeth will have a bunch of brits moaning about the anti-uk sentiment . 
  hyperboles are apparently too offensive for you . 
  being called a cunt as a brit is fairly tame , would n't be anti-polish sentiment to say poles are kurwas . 
  it 's not anti-uk to point out that the uk is extremely authoritarian leaning compared to the majority of the rest of europe . 
  go to / r/inglin or / r/ukpolitics if you wan na jerk off to the queen . 
  tldr : berlin should be sold to poland . 
   among the `` wurst '' offenders i wish i was n't such a humorless sauerkraut having trouble understanding the witty and dry british humor . 
  well , it makes sense considering the echr does n't add any colors to the brexit . 
  technically jews , christians and muslims have the same god . 
   see you in 2017 !, 
  c u, 
   she does n't care about the native germans living there . 
  if you are german i 'd be happy to argue about anything with you , but if you are n't german your `` opinion '' on german politics ( and germany ) is completely worthless and i am not going to bother with your goof ass . 
   not powerful enough to actually fix shit this applies to the german chancellor too , even within germany . 
  yeah the fact that putin loves merkel is well known . 
  so ... one shows a slight drop one a slight rise , but you conclude that one is wrong instead of that not much changed ? 
   we have no way to ensure the government wo n't overreach with these new powers . 
  yeah , except courts . 
   this is a false equivalency , having police officers enforce laws already on the books is very different from giving the government new powers to potentially censor speech . 
  the government ( executive ) is the one enforcing the law though and they are n't getting any new power . 
  they are ** enforcing ** ** current ** ** laws ** . 
  there is constitutionally no way to slip down the slippery slope the way people here pretend could happen . 
  then a bunch of redneck-yanks are hopefully going to stop claiming they are german . 
  also we are going to conquer yurope for realz this time . 
  shakira for everyone !, 
  i would argue that she in general tries to untangle the knot instead of cutting it with a scissor ( or trying to smash it with a hammer ) . 
   * dismantle all nuklear powerplants = green * minimum wage = machiavelli , fairly obvious move to keep spd down * rebuild the bundeswehr from conscription to purely professional army in order to be able to meddle around the world = hawkish * let every migrant in that manages to come without checking = bad planning , bad preparation * the scrappage program to help german car makers = the opposite of an economical liberal policy you goof . 
   the only conservative what comes to mind are the sanctions on russia . 
  and they had to be enforced as the eu+usa pressurized . 
  without pressure the sanctions would be recently dropped by merkel and her government . 
  the other way around , but alright . 
   europe needs a much more dynamic leader willing to reform and fix the eu 's problems or it 's days are numbered . 
  the days of the eu are already numbered if that task falls into the lap of the german chancellor . 
  the government already can legally stop fake news though . 
  the ones i am talking about are pretty much slander . 
  they are just starting to enforce rules and laws that are already there . 
  also there are still courts , it 's not like people do n't want any prisons or cops being able to arrest people because of all the things that might happen once you slip down the slippery slip slope . 
  the borders were n't opened . 
  they just were n't closed and dublin was suspended because the countries germany used to dump the refugees in could n't sustain that anymore . 
  if germany had closed the border you could say goodbye to the eu as several european countries between mena and germany would have had legitimate problems as they are even worse equipped in handling that amount of refugees . 
  it was the only possible short term way to relieve some pressure . 
  not necessarily a sophisticated long-term solution , but absolutely rational in that case . 
   if you hide information i asked for somebody to defend [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/onlinemagazin/status/806794281658654721?lang=de ) . 
  how is that information or an opinion ? 
  i am not arguing that anything that might be misleading or an opinion or inaccurate should be censored . 
  i am asking you to defend `` media '' making up people and quotes out of thin air . 
  in the case of made up slander-fake-news ? 
  there wo n't be an additional law though , it will just be enforced properly . 
  democracy only works with a free and reliable press . 
  it 's also illegal to impersonate the police , eventhough only stupid people would fall for someone dressed in a polo-shirt having `` polizei '' written on it . 
  i do n't know about everyone else , but i do n't feel like doing the experiment `` how gullible and dumb are people exactly ? 
  if it 's slander it is . 
  do you believe that any of their 50k followers will notice that the person quoted does n't even exist and will take everything else shared by that platform with a grain of salt ? 
  i doubt it . 
  you just got yourself a whole bunch of people whose `` opinion '' is based on literally nothing . 
  it 's not like something was misrepresented , it 's slander . 
  they are n't getting fined for someone sharing or uploading something , they would be getting fined for not removing them after some time . 
  i can add it if you 'd like me to . 
  quoting your whole statement does n't really help your case though or gives it credibility . 
  no , it 's not an opinion . 
  you are not a right winger , you are a clueless nutjob . 
  that analogy does n't work . 
  if facebook would n't take child porn down , should n't it be at least pressured into doing so ? 
   not doing anything to stop the flow lol, 
  it 's not about your `` political views '' . 
  it 's about the fact that you spew dumb bullshit and the subreddits you frequent are a pretty good indicator . 
  the subs in question are not right-wing-conservative , they are conspiracy-extreme-nationalists . 
  do n't try to make regular right wingers look bad . 
  [ explain why this should be allowed ] ( https://twitter.com/onlinemagazin/status/806794281658654721?lang=de ), 
  i do n't think cnn is active in germany or broadcasts in german .
