  well , i never saw anyone sharing the actual link , just the screenshot . 
  https://twitter.com/search?q=klamm-rothberger&amp;src=typd there obviously are people that are happy to believe it . 
  https://twitter.com/onlinemagazin/status/806794281658654721?lang=de how many of the 50k followers checked whether the person screenshotted even exists ? 
  the s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung is reputable and is n't the one who spread it . 
  the fake news site is the one who claimed that their source is the s\u00fcddeutsche . 
  [ here is an example of a quote of someone who does n't even exist ] ( http://www.mimikama.at/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-41.png ), 
  but we need to know whether he gets a federal cross of merit !, 
  itt : ( 20th thread on the topic in which ) people ignore the difference between inaccurate , misleading and biased depictions and made up bullshit aiming to agitate . 
  also hitler + germany + nazi and did anyone else have to read 1984 in school ? 
   they 're just resisting the direction that angela merkel , the eurocrats in brussels , and other mainstream internationalists have for them . 
  [ ... ] media campaign against poland . 
   sane , good read, 
  dae germans literally nazis brainwashed morons literlaly takin over yurope and so nazi nazi leftliberal sjw authoritarian no free speech and prisons gestapo !!!!!!!!, 
  considering the money is paid after they arrived in their country of origin ? 
  minority government is unlikely in my opinion . 
  great coalition , red-red-green or jamaica coalition or even just black-green coalition are all more likely . 
  if none of these can agree on a coalition treaty , they wo n't allow the cdu to form a government either . 
  55.000 asylum seekers , mostly from albania , kosovo , afghanistan , iraq , serbia and iran have left voluntarily this year , before being deported ( 25.000 this year ) . 
  a lot of them have taken the chance to take money in exchange for leaving before their asylum request is denied . 
  there are various different programs that encourage leaving voluntarily and there will be more in the future . 
  the amount of money depends on the program , the country of origin and the age of the children . 
  a family of five deciding to levae before their asylum request is denied gets , additionally to basic support , 4.200 $ . 
  when your friends spy on you , drag you into wars and do n't do you any favors , are they really your friends ? 
   they were part of the allies that actually helped germany after wwii with money and resources . 
  they also took intellectual property and patents worth slightly more . 
  there are a lot more factors why germany developed the way it did and it really does n't owe jack to anyone , especially nowadays . 
  good to know according to you the rest of europe owes germany , benelux , italy and france everything they have though . 
  as i said . 
  accusations . 
  and as i said . 
  point still stands . 
  no and it 's not up to estonia to make that deal !, 
  you did n't understand my comment . 
  no you did n't . 
  `` factssansfeels '' tbh , i 'd actually be happy if germany was spying on the us too . 
  an eye for an eye or something like that . 
  i doubt that the bnd helped with the industrial spionage and spying on government officials . 
  also the point i 'm making is that the us is the worst ally since italy , so the distinction does n't matter that much . 
  well , none of these talk about any hard proven facts , do they ? 
  some people like to make accusations , but they are worthless if you do n't provide proof . 
  `` is accused of '' . 
   no , you 'll never be `` even '' for wwii . 
  lol . 
   do we share it with russia and offer russian spies protection ? 
  well , the us systematically spying on germany is proven due to tha boi eddward snowden , while the only thing proven in regards to germany spying on the us is that germany accidentally recorded a few calls . 
  yeah , we do . 
  now fuck off . 
  [ the us did n't rebuild germany after wwii though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wirtschaftswunder ) and the us spies on germany ( its people , companies and leaders ) too . 
  germany does n't owe shit to the us , we 're even . 
  tough banter from the suburbs of leningrad !, 
  but ... 
  i thanked you for your service already !, 
  o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 zanks for sawing ze world . 
  o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 o7 never forget the humanitarian aid of le yankys !, 
  wow , you are really putting in some effort , boy !, 
  never forget the mishandling of the glorious yank corn . 
  thank you for your service . 
  o7 ** o7 ** o7 ** o7 ** o7, 
  thanks for clarifying that you are just joking . 
  okay . 
  let 's take a look at what you wrotes . 
   mus n't mention the holocaust of jews by frenchmen and germans . 
  must forget that they murdered germans for being part-part-part jew . 
  must not mention that germans looted all of europe [ ... ] except that the whole world , especially germany , has been circlejerking about it for the last 70 years . 
  not sure why you mention the frenchies . 
   [ ... ] now sell horseshit myths right to our faces about how they pulled themselves up by their bootstraps . 
  [ ... ] can not stand german public opinion regarding : post-war reconstruction [ ... ] i wanted this out of spite when germans told me we did n't give them the greatest humanitarian gift of all time there are various reasons why germany did well economically . 
  you seem to imply that the marshall plan is the only reason , but considering the 10 billion the us paid to germany is not just less than what the us pumped into countries like the uk or italy , but the us also took patents worth around the same and also did n't really care a whole lot where those fancy inventions came from and also did n't care a whole lot about the ideology of all those scientists . 
  not sure about the mental gymnastics you have to do to pretend like the marshall plan is a `` humanitarian gift '' . 
   their foreign policy in everything from sarajevo to baghdad . 
  there has never been a people more habitually on the wrong side of history and convinced they 're exceptional . 
  saying this as a yank about germany does n't make a whole lot of sense to me tbh . 
   i said you 're going to lose the uk oh no !, 
   you 'll find us out of nato fast as shit if this attitude you all possess catches on . 
  okay , but germany does n't really need nato and could ( and imo should ) just leave it too , so ... go ahead i guess ? 
   guess what , we 're aware , it caught on , we are done with europe . 
  hopefully . 
   america the place that gets hit with all kinds of condemnation for historical crimes going back three hundred years while germans get off scot-free again not sure if you are being serious . 
   or else we destroy the transatlantic alliance and see how you guys do in an age of nationalist great power politics . 
  probably gon na do alright . 
  real question is whether the yanks will find better allies , especially with all the shit y' all pull . 
  it 's not germany that started a bunch of invasions and wars , dragging the us into it , spied on us people , companies and government , shits on human rights and acts two-faced in general . 
  really not sure if i just got baited by a troll . 
  feel free to point out the last time the us did something as a favor to germany btw . 
  i honestly do n't even know who `` we '' is when you do n't flair up , but nothing of that sounds like it goes against the interests of germany in any way ? 
   or else . 
  or else what , / u/belizehouse ? 
   such a coalition has the potential to cause full on civil war . 
  lol . 
   assad is back in control of aleppo now . 
  you can start sending them back and cleaning up the mess merkel created by issuing her invitation . 
  yanks are n't supporting assad though and assad is the reason they fled in the first place ? 
  no one is going to be deported as long as assad is in control . 
   the time of roth , k\u00fcnast and trittin is mostly over anyway . 
  yet people like them make up a decent amount of greens in the bundestag . 
  the sane and more centered greens have n't taken over on a federal level yet . 
  i 'm not wasting any more time with ** you ** !, 
  you already made it clear above that you do n't understand hyperboles . 
  i do n't think so . 
  what ?
