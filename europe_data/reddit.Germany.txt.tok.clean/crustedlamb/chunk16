  hyperbole . 
  taken straight out of development funds for tunisia !!!, 
  oh and taking a huge dump on checks and balances , but who cares about that sort of silly democracy stuff . 
   a problem poland does n't have . 
  yep , just their government dumping democracy in favor of becoming turkey . 
  also ( ( ( globalist eu ) ) ) not wanting a country like turkey inside the eu . 
  damn them !, 
  largest non-asian `` newspaper '' even . 
  the us has a low muslim population too ... , 
  did you just write how to divide europe when it 's clearly not ** all ** of europe in this picture it 's just the eu you disgusting europhile !, 
  well , your opinion does n't really matter in this case and i doubt that any of those three would stand any chance in germany , especially against merkel . 
   [ young white western men radicalizing ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/17753048_404.jpg ), 
   dont you of all people remember what happened when rome opened their door for vandals ? 
  he 's probably not that old . 
  i 'm always wearing it . 
  are you calling me dumb ? 
  i do n't understand . 
   she would be out on her ear in the uk . 
  why ? 
   i wonder why germans put up with it . 
  what do you mean by `` it '' ? 
  lol, 
  technically , but an asylum seeker is n't necessarily even allowed to work and does n't come to work in the first place . 
  does n't have anything to do with `` orwellian language '' . 
  no , it 's about `` asylum seekers '' . 
  itt : people still ( after more than one year ) not understanding the difference between an asylum seeker / refugee and an immigrant in the legal context . 
  happy circlejerking reddit !, 
  you can read up on it on / r/thathappened . 
  too bad that sexualdelikt is not an actual legal term and our springer-boys know that too , which is why they do n't differentiate between all the different ways to `` assault '' someone . 
  also sexuelle beleidigung is not a legal term either and i assume that several of the crimes in the graph are duplicates . 
  crazy that i have to explain to someone possibly old enough to vote that his springer-rag is a shit source . 
  catcalling is national news now . 
  good thing we cleared that up now . 
  i am sorry the numbers i stated above are not 100 % correct , i hope you will forgive me considering you have n't presented detailed numbers either . 
  except that `` sexual assault '' in this case can mean anything from catcalling to gang rape . 
  none of the articles you posted contradict what i said though ? 
  not sure why you are responding ? 
  how does that add anything or contradict anything i said ? 
  nothing you just said invalidates anything i said . 
  not trying to prove anything . 
  just saying that 1500 crimes is not possible just in the main station and around it and includes at the very least all of the city . 
   always done by the same method and men from arab countries . 
  a grand conspiracy by the maghrebis not only to rape and pillage , but also to become arab countries !, 
   and you are helping nobody by trying to downplay that issue . 
  i am not downplaying anything and i am also not trying to help . 
  the whole thing was completely overblown and the fact that people are still trying to use it as an argument for anything is ridiculous . 
  as i said , it became big as a symbol , not because what happened is `` big '' . 
  feelz ** always ** beat realz !, 
  had you tagged for quite a while now ; i 'm convinced now that you are an actual troll . 
  a pretty good one too . 
   `` authorities have acknowledged mistakes in response to the violence . 
  cologne 's police described a `` festive atmosphere -- celebrations largely peaceful '' to the disgust of many witnesses , while cologne 's local news media failed to report the story . 
  more than 500 complaints stemming from new year 's eve were submitted to authorities , 150 of which involve sexual assault . '',

   yes , those things are connected . 
  brits watching germany and making conclusions are no different than californians watching events in texas . 
  lol, 
  pretty sure the eu urged the uk to do it within 3 weeks . 
   it 's been less than 6 months anyway , it 's not like she 's delayed it for a year and a half . 
  well , it 's probably going to be a 9 months time span between referendum and formally starting the process , instead of something like two or three weeks . 
   all she seems to have right now is `` red , white and blue '' . 
  which is fairly fucking embarassing . 
   neither side wants a 2-year time pressure when stuff like that is your starting point . 
  one side is actually prepared though . 
   but repeatedly saying `` you should have done this/that beforehand '' does n't actually change the situation . 
  it 's not meant to change the situation . 
  it 's meant to point out whose fault the situation is in case someone tries to shift the blame like  which throws us directly into an arbitrarily short negotiating period when neither side ( but especially us ) has fully worked out their position . 
  you can tell article 50 was designed to never be used , it 's terrible . 
  when in reality it 's entirely the fault of the british government that they are not prepared . 
   neither side ( but especially us ) has fully worked out their position . 
  should have had a position / a clear proposition before the referendum . 
  was n't on breitbart or russian state tv so it did n't happen !, 
  well , considering the only kid in all of germany that 's gon na fit your criteria is the one in the article , that seems like a completely pointless question . 
  even the one in the article does n't completely fit your criteria . 
   terrorist attack - a surprise attack involving the deliberate use of violence against civilians in the hope of attaining political or religious aims i doubt that separatists thought it would help their cause to shoot down a bunch of wooden shoe wearing cheeseheads . 
   i asked for a similar case in germany of a 12y/o trying to kill a lot of people . 
  nah you did n't . 
   find an example of a 12 year old radicalised german kid from a christian background and then we can compare . 
  maybe we should put the western `` bully '' kid into mali and see what happens ? 
  try to find another 12 year old from any background in germany trying to kill hundreds of people ( with a bunch of firecrackers !, 
  you ca n't ? 
  i guess that proves my point !!, 
  you asked for a radicalised kid , did n't you ? 
   deadliest terror attack in european history was mh17 was n't a terror attack tho . 
   find an example of a 12 year old radicalised german kid from a christian background and then we can compare . 
  there you go , buddy . 
   put radical muslims under surveilance they already are though . 
  the funny thing is that you probably expect people to take you seriously . 
   well there are also people who take notice that doing what the west wants will let you away with anything , including mass murder , ( e.g. 
  saudi arabia ) but that does n't see to influence our policy very much . 
  that 's still not comparable and i think you misunderstood . 
  if `` the west '' had already imposed sanctions on saudi arabia and then pulled them back without the reason for the sanction disappearing that 's an entirely different situation than not imposing sanctions at all . 
  one makes you look weak , the other makes you look like a hypocrite or like someone who does n't care . 
   if business interests are at stake they already are though . 
  at least in germany 's case i highly doubt that the somewhat harming sanctions are dropped as long as the civil war is active . 
   people have short term memories and limited attention spans . 
  there are people outside of `` the west '' though who will absolutely take notice of the fact that you can get rid of sanctions just by sitting them out . 
  feel free to elaborate in what way these situations are comparable . 
  also mind that credibility is not necessarily `` all or nothing '' . 
  even if someones credibility has already been decreased that does n't mean there 's a lot more credibility to lose .
