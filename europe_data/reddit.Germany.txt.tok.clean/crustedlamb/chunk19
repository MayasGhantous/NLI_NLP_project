  why not risk some more democracy ? 
  one of my favorite mottos of a chancellor . 
  ;-) `` ja zur demokratie sagen , aber nein zu den parteien , ist nicht m\u00f6glich '' - w. thierse [ considering you seem to have skipped your social studies classes ... ] ( http://www.bpb.de/lernen/themen-im-unterricht/politisches-system/ ), 
   problem is merkels style of politics . 
  she is like a sleeping-pill that kills all charisma . 
  yeah , a chancellor primarily has to be charismatic ... feelz  realz  to bring more life into german politics , i would propose ... people either join parties and be politically engaged or stop moaning ? 
  shaking things up for the sake of shaking things up is one of the worst ideas one can come up with . 
  pretty much all of germany is `` white dominated '' and i doubt that afro-germans being around makes kids less likely to walk to school on their own . 
   elementary students walk to school on their own . 
  is that supposed to be special ? 
  i 'm pretty sure elementary students walking to school on their own is pretty normal . 
  i 'm not insulting anyone though . 
   can they agree on anything ? 
  you obviously did n't listen . 
  brexit means brexit and it will be a titanic success !, 
  any questions ? 
   many muslims disagree with this and will get violent over this . 
  [ ... ] there is no judge involved in this process at any point because as i see it there is no law against drawing mohammed stuck figures . 
  so violence is allowed ? 
  again : you and the other gentlemen completely missed the point and are obviously not putting in any effort to comprehend why you are beside the question . 
  considering you seem to be pretty average on the reddit brightness scale : reddit is not a relevant news source . 
  people that get their news from reddit do n't deserve to even be listened to . 
   ** legitimize exclusion and discrimination ** the top minds of reddit have spoken already though , they are the ones who define words . 
  sure , but we were talking about polls . 
  you did n't understand what i said . 
  you have to be especially retarded if that 's what you get from my statements . 
  the institution that decides what you can and can not do is the legislative and the one that decides whether you broke the law is the judiciary . 
  therefore the judiciary decides `` who is right '' based on the laws the legislative made . 
  / r/europe seems to think that violent mobs enforce rules . 
  or it 's the `` people got mad at someone which clearly means something he did is illegal because that 's how things work '' which is also one of the fun go-to bullshit on here . 
   all wikileaks is exposing is what a lot us who are n't afraid to deal with the facts except that wikileaks did n't expose anything new . 
  things that are actually `` top secret '' do n't get digitalized . 
  it was also our homeboy edward snowden not wikileaks . 
  this `` leak '' is de facto public knowledge anyway . 
   ( i 'm a big supporter of strong action on climate change ... 
  but also a big opponent of german humor ;-) ) okay . 
  good talking to you mate . 
  i just pointed out that it is indeed possible to be `` racist against a culture '' . 
  you can discuss the benefits of being black in areas with a lot of sunlight exposure without being racist too . 
   that cultural differences legitimize exclusion and discrimination based on racial notions and ranking of culture as higher and lower in relation to each other . 
  you are a clich\u00e9 , buddy . 
  you will have to check out how the legislative , execute and judiciary works . 
  no idea what your problem is , bud . 
  looks like you and a few other people completely missed the point . 
   why ? 
  freedom of speech is the number 1 pillar western countries are built on . 
  then why are did you ask in the first place . 
  if there is a dispute over law it usually goes to a judge . 
  yeah would be a shame if the ukraine got invaded by anyone . 
  or if someone would start bombing civilians anywhere or anything nazi-esque like that . 
  let 's just hope something like that is n't going to happen . 
  god forbid there would be an authoritarian state with a leader cult anywhere . 
  reminds me of the nazis !!!!, 
  oh i forgot that the forces of violence trump the forces of legislature and judiciary . 
  you know what else worked for hungary ? 
  [ shipping their refugees to austria and germany before implementing an actual border ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/04/hundreds-refugees-march-austria-budapest-hungary-syrians ) [ great hungarian solutions ] ( http://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2015/09/04/refugees-leaving-hungary-on-foot-and-by-bus-after-austria-germany-agree-to-take-them-in ), 
  yeah , we should wall the netherlands in so when they go under we do n't have to live together will all those cheeseheads . 
  build the wall !, 
   it is impossible to be racist against a culture . 
   i think we should be able to depict whatever the hell we want , they disagree , ** who is in the right here ? 
  ** you will have to ask a judge about that . 
   economic blockade and restricting internet access of sovereign nation sound pretty nazi to me invading sovereign nations sounds pretty nazi to me . 
   was it reported on r/europe or r/de ? 
  oh how silly to forget about reddit !!!!!!!!!, 
  polls and predictions are not the same thing . 
  did i ask for a prediction or for a poll ? 
  you just pretended i asked for predictions and forecasts . 
  pretty sure i asked for a poll ( i even wrote it in caps ) . 
  you seem to be another expert who does n't comprehend the difference between a poll and a prediction . 
  you missed the point , bud . 
  you are an immigrant and not a refugee though . 
  or did you try to claim asylum in the us ? 
  then you completely missed the topic , bud . 
   i was saying that polls are not as reliable as you think . 
  i never said that polls are correct , they are a good indicator and they are a really good indicator when they show something like a 15 % lead . 
   you want to aroggantly belive the polls be my guest ... 
  if you want to remain a stubborn half-wit be my guest . 
   it doesnt . 
  but it makes it much smaller then what you stated ... 
  it does n't get much smaller , especially when you just blindly mash different polls together . 
   now you are mixing popular vote polls and state polls . 
  great !, 
  no i am not . 
   american election is won on swing-states their polls are the most important . 
  you wanted to compare them to the referendum and the german federal election , which makes those state polls irrelevant . 
   oh just admit its stupid for multiple polls aka election poll like clintons 4 point lead ... [ ... ]  polls of polls , which take the mean result from lots of different polls , have a much larger sample size , and therefore a smaller margin of error and are regarded as giving a more accurate representation of the population . 
  no it is not . 
  if you had read what i wrote above you would know that the margin of error does n't just magically disappear just because of a bigger sampling size . 
  the indication of those polling averages was there is a big chance that clinton would indeed get a slight lead in the popular vote , which happened . 
  if the polls were `` wrong '' we would have seen a huge popular vote lead from trump , which we did n't . 
  you will have to check out my previous two comments again . 
   the margin of error that you insists on is kinda pointless . 
  that 's just wrong and you deserve spanking from whoever is teaching you statistics . 
  predictions = / = polls for the 5th time dude . 
  [ this ] ( http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/538.png ) is a prediction . 
  [ this ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/16ba7/production/_90659039_uspollsclintontrump.png ) is a poll . 
  who was it again who wanted to bomb libya , did n't properly manage to and then called big daddy sammy from across the pond ? 
  [  2 to 5 is not average margin of error . 
  ] ( http://www.statisticshowto.com/how-to-calculate-margin-of-error/ )  4 points lead gives you atleast 70 % of winning . 
  whoever told you that should not be a teacher or should never start teaching statistics or maths .
