   number of arrivals that skyrocketed after that statement . 
  nah , that 's not what you can conclude from that graph . 
  just gon na quote your shit tabloid article now . 
   the merkel-hollande talks in berlin ** came as the europe-wide migration crisis ** entered an intense new phase . 
  ...  the ** austrian foreign minister , sebastian kurz ** , said on monday that the ** dublin agreement `` no longer works '' ** after visiting macedonia . 
  ** the balkans are `` overrun and overwhelmed '' ** , he said . 
  `` the dublin system does n't only work terribly , it actually does n't work at all any more , '' he said . 
  ...  `` what we need , and what we are sadly still lacking , is the collective courage to ** follow through on our commitments ** even when they are not easy ; even when they are not popular , '' [ ... ] `` instead what i see is finger-pointing -- a tired blame game which ... is ** not actually solving any problems ** . '' ...  many migrants in greece sought to travel onwards to ** macedonia ** last week en route for northern europe . 
  skopje closed its border for three days . 
  ** police ** used stun grenades and batons to keep refugees at bay before ** standing aside to let everyone enter ** . 
  ...  berlin took the lead in efforts to resolve the european refugee crisis on monday by declaring all syrian asylum-seekers welcome to remain in germany -- no matter which eu country they had first entered . 
  neither is this one . 
  hmm , the biggest trading partner of germany in 2016 was china . 
  the 2nd biggest france and the 3rd biggest the us . 
  each of them accounting for less than 10 % of germany 's trade . 
  on the other hand , for a lot of european countries germany is by far the biggest trading partner . 
  more than 30 % of czech exports go to germany for example . 
  and you seem to have an insufficient reading comprehension . 
  well , what you said was just factually wrong and i honestly thought you were joking . 
  no it is not . 
   my point is that no one agreed to have germany be the buffer prior to a redistribution so there is no room to ask for other countries to take them in . 
  except , you know countries voted in the eu council to relocate 160.000 refugees . 
   no one agreed to have germany be the buffer well , the alternative was for germany to send them back and close its borders . 
  i highly doubt austria/hungary/italy / greece/bulgaria/the other balkan countries would have prefered that . 
   lastly , i want this union to survive and i do n't want this union to survive after seeing that the rest of the eu is a bunch of useless snakes . 
  i 'm more of a fdp guy , but yeah . 
  especially considered the relocation of 160.000 refugees was legally required . 
  either you do what you say and play by the rules or you get your butt spanked by ze chulz . 
  lmao, 
   career eucrats like schulz the career eucrat who spent his twenties selling books , his thirtys being a mayor of a 40.000 inhabitant town and went into eu politics in his 40s ? 
   what do you mean , trying to change the rules ? 
  the slovak proposal was simply presenting new possible solutions to the crisis , it was n't changing any rules . 
  well , there was a binding vote on the relocation . 
  they then went ahead and ignored that and came up with a complete bullshit `` idea '' which basically meant `` fuck the rules , we do what we want '' . 
   the eu does not have a common immigration policy , its member states should not have to save germany or sweden because they have a bad immigration policy that 's not what 's happening though . 
   fight for more equality by making member states do what you want them by force instead of giving them ... an ... equal ... voice you already have an equal voice . 
   cutting the eu funds seems like a punitive measure that is guaranteed to create a backlash here . 
  well , you could avoid it by contributing something . 
   it also completely unnecessarily affects fields which have nothing in common with migration policy whatsoever boohoo . 
   tons of legal work to even make it legit from the legal point you mean like trying to change the rules after something did n't go your way ? 
  `` flexible solidarity '' ? 
   czech government takes money from the state budget and sends them to italy/greece . 
  problem solved . 
  do it then . 
   unlike her trump actually cares about protection of american citizens . 
  is that why he is locking them out of the us ? 
  did n't understand that one tbh . 
   the slovak presidency actually had a proposal on this , it was firstly labeled as flexible solidarity if anyone wants to contribute anything you could just ... do it . 
  `` flexible solidarity '' was a fancy way of saying `` i do n't accept the legally binding vote , fuck off '' . 
  it 's not an actual plan or anything substantial . 
  he absolutely is talking about the 23 eu countries who are either doing nothing or are outright blocking and actively working against any solutions . 
   just let us contribute in other ways then do it please . 
  and make the other 20 something countries sitting in the corner do something too . 
  why, 
   your country 's shame . 
  what would that be ? 
  you seem to be jealous i can afford a decent amount of wholesome food and the cleanest bright white socks money can buy . 
  he 's not from north korea where ridiculing the glorious leader and insulting your country is the same thing though . 
  i would come up with my own cringey wit , but i do n't even know where the fuck slovakia is . 
   stick to the things you are good at , like tolerance and respect . 
  and being the greatest nation that mankind has ever formed on this planet . 
  tough banter straight out of ee/balkans ? 
   if a subset of countries is absolutely unwilling to accept this we should cut the eu down to countries that are willing . 
  the eu should have been benelux/germany/france . 
  well , you do n't even have to say thank you , we would prefer it if you would stop being useless though . 
  and acknowledge that you have to take on more responsibility in the future and not rely on germany to step in when all you little countryballs wan na play hot potato . 
  with germoneys . 
  all of them . 
   for instance , what if greece decided to welcome 3 million migrants and then coerce the rest of the union to pay for them ? 
  that would be fairly weird , but i do n't see how that relates to this . 
  you are n't making any sense . 
   imagine schengen secured border yeah imagine that . 
  but you little shits are n't doing that . 
  which is why germany has to make sure you little cutiepies do n't end up with more than you can handle . 
  hungary 's fence is incredibly useless considering they first let in a few hundred thousand refugees and then refused to register , feed or in any way take care of them . 
  then those geniuses built a fence ... which was ready after the turkey deal when there were a few measly hundred refugees left . 
  got ta be fucking kidding me . 
  if germany builds a fence to austria and ships all refugees to the netherlands , that 's not a solution , is it ? 
   look at what hungary did , they actually solved the problem ... 
  please tell me you are kidding . 
   i dont think its a european problem . 
  cool , but you are wrong . 
   what we should have done is build a wall from slovenian coast to hungarian border with ukraine and only accept syrian refugees into the schengen . 
  sure , but you did n't . 
   if germany would not be willing to accept them they would not come ... wrong again . 
  and that 's why the chulz got a point . 
  germany saving your butts and somehow you found a way to actually blame germany . 
  holy shit . 
  well , the refugees are a european problem , but the vast majority of the eu does n't seem to be interested in contributing ... anything ... to solving the problem . 
  imagine how much easier things could be if it was n't 5 , but instead 28 countries putting in some effort . 
  imagine the chaos if germany would start playing hot potato too . 
   who will join such a union ? 
  sweden and germany ? 
  would absolutely love a union with sweden tbh . 
  add switzerland for the german/swiss/swedish engineering all stars !, 
  nah , it would just mean that it would be an actual union , not a bunch of leeching babies trying to get some milk out of that german teat . 
   [ donald trump should be allowed to enter the uk in his capacity as head of the us government , but he should not be invited to make an official state visit because it would cause embarrassment to her majesty the queen . 
  ] ( https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928 ), 
   we ca n't take the whimsical ideals of every nation into mind when making policy that is designed to focus on america , first and foremost . 
  this is n't what 's happening here though .
