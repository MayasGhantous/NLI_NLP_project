   there may be a cap on the number of asylums granted or considered . 
  that is n't what is being proposed though . 
  the people proposing it think they can let in 200k a year and as soon as 200.000 entered germany they let in 0 . 
  `` refugee cap '' is just a nonsense idea and having a working deportation system and reducing the number of refugees arriving in the first place makes a lot more sense . 
  the refugee cap thing is just a strawman . 
  hmm , i do n't really need to , because i am capable of understanding the difference between putting a cap on how many people may request asylum and putting a cap on how many people get to actually immigrate . 
  it just says what i said . 
   national surveys gave hillary clinton a lead of around four percentage points i said between 2 and 5 % . 
  4 is between 2 and 5 afaik ? 
  yep , all the refugees coming by plane , i forgot about those !, 
  apparently no cap for refugees means no cap on immigration !, 
  who knew ? 
  yeah it 's known that all the refugees magically appear in germany and the rest of them always lands by boat on the frisian islands . 
  also apparently none of the nine countries surrounding are in schengen apparently . 
   if you think trump chances were in 2 % to 5 % bracket you are crazy . 
  i never said that , i said that the polls showed that the difference was 2 to 5 % . 
   we are talking 70 % to 30 % for clinton . 
  show me a poll that showed clinton at 70 % . 
  pretty sure they were both hovering in the 40 's . 
   why is it so hard to understand hans ? 
  rich coming from someone who does n't know the difference between polls and predictions . 
  good thing that germany does n't have a whole lot of outer schengen borders then . 
  we do n't have to act like it !, 
  i always thought swiss are the only ones worse at humor than germans . 
  i assume that 's what the csu says . 
  just like the ausl\u00e4ndermaut ? 
  assuming shit hits the fan . 
  the only people that have been `` burned '' are people that do n't understand the margin of error . 
  the `` polls r bad '' meme does n't apply to the german federal election . 
  [ midway through her second term , merkel 's approval plummeted in germany , resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party . 
  [ 82 ] an august 2011 poll found her coalition had only 36 % support compared to a rival potential coalition 's 51 % . 
  [ 83 ] however , she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis ( 69 % rated her performance as good rather than poor ) , and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77 % in february 2012 and again in july 2014 . 
  [ 84 ] merkel 's approval rating dropped to 54 % in october 2015 , during the european migrant crisis , the lowest since 2011 . 
  [ 85 ] according to a poll conducted after terror attacks in germany merkel 's approval rating dropped to 47 % ( august 2016 ) . 
  [ 86 ] half of germans did not want her to serve a fourth term in office compared to 42 % in favor . 
  [ 87 ] however , according to a poll taken in october 2016 , her approval rating had been found to have risen again , 54 % of germans were found to be satifsfied with work of merkel as chancelor . 
  [ 88 ] according to another poll taken in november 2016 , 59 % were to found to be in favour of a renewed chancelor candidature of merkel in 2017 . 
  [ 89 ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angela_merkel#approval_ratings ), 
  an upper limit is a nonsense idea and a strawman . 
  it indeed is , but i think it 's better to at least give everyone a chance to prove that they are legitimate refugees . 
  sort of like people also get a fair trial and do n't just get randomly locked in . 
  the legitimacy of procedures should be upheld . 
  there are another 8 % that do n't have german citizenship . 
  please just read what i wrote , i wo n't bother to repeat what i said if you do n't bother to actually comprehend it . 
  the cap is for refugees not for immigrants . 
   csu simply tries to stay relevant by pushing one of their nonsense approaches into the focus , like every election . 
  i got you bro . 
  the australian approach of discouraging refugees in the first place , not the australian approach of putting camps on islands , which is arguably a lot worse than declaring a country of origin safe and having a deal with said country and just deporting people . 
   the cap is arbitrary and obsolete . 
  which is why it makes a lot of sense to just say no to that csu nonsense . 
  it 's not an actual solution it 's just feel-good doing things for the sake of doing things . 
   yep , the eu and specifically angela merkel are to blame here . 
  she could save many more people by taking in zero that come to europe illegally and taking an australian approach . 
  more importantly , she would improve the lives for hundreds of millions of europeans ( who have no responsibility for the corrosive culture of arabs ) by this course of action too . 
  it 's sad that people actually believe this type of stuff , especially on / r/europe . 
  germany has been doing the exact thing with the balkans and it is obviously not effective . 
  the best thing to do is to negotiate deals with the countries of origin to make the deportation process as simple as possible . 
   america 's seems to be the best overall for a single country the united arab emirates seems to have the best overall for a single country considering they have the highest score ? 
  you 're lucky berlin is n't getting ~ ~ sold ~ ~ gifted to russia along with the rest of east germany . 
  ahh those real cities reyling on hillbilly money to not go under . 
  yeah , it 's obviously subjective . 
  i just wanted to show how shit berlin makes you feel !, 
  it does n't , but it 's pretty much well accepted that berlin is not a nice city and pretending like berlin is better than munich or southern german cities in general is delusional . 
  [ look , i found a not complete shit picture of wolfsburg !, 
  i guess wolfsburg is great !,

  actually grey and depressing soviet style housing is pretty much what people associate with it . 
  i said russian cities and most people associate [ this ] ( http://www.nordregio.se/global/jon/jon%202011/apatity_odd%20iglebaek.jpg ) with it .

  berlin looks russian , smells indian and has american crime rates . 
  i do n't think there 's a person in berlin who 's not a hipster , foreigner or criminal . 
  baw\u00fc is not a city , but stuttgart easily makes the top 10 . 
  actually baw\u00fc takes up 8 of the 10 spots . 
  sorry , but berlin easily makes the top 3 of worst german cities . 
  not sure how you made that connection , considering a decent chunk of the `` poor people with few opportunities in the conventional job market '' are part of the native population ? 
  mostly greeks probably and some russians . 
  most people assumed that the article would be triggered within a week and most people are `` angry '' because taking a year between announcing to start doing something and starting to do something is fairly annoying and bad for the markets . 
  the ep is actually fairly irrelevant , especially in this case . 
  and i guess the prime minister got brought into this , because this is a thread about what the prime minister said ? 
  when it comes to government officials the message from the eu was `` let 's start the negotiations asap and not negotiate anything before that '' while the official uk government has been trying to test the waters . 
  no idea why we even have to argue about that . 
  how is the statement of an mep comparable to the statement of a prime minister ? 
  ep mep and prime minister are apprently comparable positions . 
  except that no one asked `` why wo n't you tell us what kind of deal you want ? '' . 
  it 's the uk trying to test the waters . 
  sickening to see the uk not having a plan and leaving everyone hanging for a year . 
  sickening to see the uk not understanding what `` no '' and `` rules '' mean . 
   i ca n't think of any visionary regarding the eu in germany now , however . 
  can you ? 
  have you looked in doctor 's offices ? 
   i 've mentioned it several times . 
  i do n't want to waste more time on you . 
  you are not capable of understanding it . 
  partly because of your bigotry , but mostly because of your stupidity . 
  okay , good talk mate !, 
   no i did not . 
  your bigotry came up with that .
