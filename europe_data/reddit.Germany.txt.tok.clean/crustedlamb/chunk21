  so if norway never had had muslim immigration , i do n't think he had decided to kill those people . 
  _  and if he had done that , then that was that . 
  but that is not what the discussion was about , so it 's completely irrelevant . 
  what is the discussion about ? 
   breivik as an example of terrorism that would have happened even without muslim immigration , does not work . 
  as i said above , it 's a fallacy to assume he would n't have either justified it differently or would have done something similar in the name of another ideology . 
  the context does n't really matter , considering you brought the idea up that muslim immigrants are responsible for right wing terrorism . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5f157u/swiss_municipality_of_oberwillieli_who_refused/dahe7lw/  breivik was a direct consequence of muslim immigration . 
  so if norway never had had muslim immigration , i do n't think he had decided to kill those people . 
  `` muslim immigrants are the cause of right wing extremists '' `` no muslims = no right wing extremists . '', 
  i mean you obviously do n't have anything to add . 
  we got to uncover the roots of terrorism ( people that do something nice guys do n't like and are therefore responsible for terrorists ) , any more insight you can offer ? 
  how do i avoid being robbed ? 
  walk around without anything worthy to rob ? 
  is agent verdantfuppe on the case already ? 
  i closed the case already , do n't try to have the last word , defendant . 
   no i 'm not . 
  _  i 'm saying that using breivik 's attacks as an example of terrorism that would have happened even if norway had never had any muslim immigration _  if you remove the reasons for the attack , do you still think they would have done it ? 
  probably not . 
  _  breivik was a direct consequence of muslim immigration . 
  so if norway never had had muslim immigration , i do n't think he had decided to kill those people . 
  case closed . 
  you are arguing on the assumption that breivik was a nice guy and then muslim immigrants made him a terrorist . 
  you are relativizing . 
  calling me dumb does n't change the fact you are arguing based on the `` xy made him do it '' . 
   i said that was highly unlikely , seeing as the sole reason for breivik 's attack , was muslim immigration . 
  in other words you blame muslim immigrants for anders breivik . 
  i 'm sure he would have been a real stand up guy if he was n't provoked by those stupid social democratic teenagers . 
  when will those social democratic 16yrs old finally learn not to create mentally unstable right wing extremist terrorists ? 
  making policies regardless of whether someone thinks it justifies terrorism ? 
  that would be crazy talk !, 
   if there were no muslims in norway , breivik would not have done it . 
  that 's why he targeted the youth organization of a social democratic party . 
  are we really getting to the point where we say `` well , you should n't have done x , you clearly deserved getting killed . 
  breivik is just a poor misunderstood young man who would n't have done anything if you did n't provoke him by living in the same country as him and having different political views !,

  not speaking and understanding the local language makes you a tourist . 
  not a personal attack to describe the area someone remains in . 
  is saying you are on an island an insult too ? 
  you reached retarded territory bro . 
  are you thick ? 
  the quote is creepy . 
  if the quote does n't creep you out , you got issues . 
  there is no context to justify a surveillance state , as i said above several times already . 
  the fact that you do n't understand that just proves my point that brits have strong authoritarian tendencies . 
  thanks for helping me out , bud . 
  i 'm not lying though ? 
  where did i lie ? 
  i think that building a surveillance state is not okay under any circumstances ; it does n't matter if someone tries to justify surveillance of the population with `` terrorism '' or `` protect the children '' . 
  surveillance state is surveillance state and i 'm pretty sure the quote is real ? 
  i do n't understand the context . 
  i do n't think israel gets critized for not allowing a known terrorist to freely waltz into israel ? 
  we have to protect the people from terrorists and we have to protect the children !, 
  just because you obey the law it does n't mean you have rights !, 
  nothing to hide , nothing to fear !, 
  you obviously think that a surveillance state is justified ; i guess i made my case . 
  sure , but i got an `` inform yourself about the bad things the usa is doing '' vibe from what he wrote . 
  except that the uk has laws that actually legally allow wide far more wide reaching surveillance . 
  i also never stated that the us is part of the free western world , it is him who brought the us up . 
  also `` rest of the western world '' is just a way for some proportionality , not the ultimate measure . 
  he ( and you ) also obviously did n't grasp the difference between agencies doing something illegally and a government openly creating ways to do it legally and actually requiring it . 
  the uk has ** stronger ** authoritarian tendencies than ** most ** other western countries . 
  do you like it better that way ? 
  most people have nothing but an opinion , but contrary to the butthurt answers i got , i provided reasons and examples and based my opinion on something factual and did n't try to deflect , build up strawmen or became butthurt . 
  not required , but also not a random selfless act that has nothing to do with nato . 
  chances are that there was the expectation that the us , canada , the uk , germany and france each take a role . 
  spon is far more left than sueddeutsche though . 
  and spon is the abiturienten-bild .

  usa got poland , germany lithuania , canada latvia and uk estonia . 
   yes , we are . 
  the people making decisions will be governments of countries . 
  no you are n't ...  the uk can decide if it wants to let irish people work in the uk . 
  the eu does not get to decide this . 
  this is something that the uk can control . 
  you obviously can allow anyone to work in the uk , but you wo n't get any favors from the eu in return . 
  you can also toss 200 unicorns to the netherlands , but you wo n't get anything in return . 
  you obviously have no clue how negotiations between the eu and non-eu places work . 
  you are n't negotiating with single countries . 
  you ca n't do  irish citizens have the right to work in the uk ( in return for irish support on free trade that 's simply not the way it works . 
   uk 's tariffs , uk 's choice . 
  uk does not need to treat each eu member state in the same way . 
  it can give advantages to particular member states . 
  it actually ca n't , because the eu is one single market . 
  ( uk will not have finished transposing eu law into domestic law by then . 
  also , article 50 gives us two years . ), 
  the 27 current members have decided that due to the fact that article 50 was not properly triggered , its rules do n't apply . 
   it is n't a question of tariffs being dropped , it is a question of tariffs not being introduced . 
  however , if agreement can not be reached here , ultimately the uk should unilaterally impose zero tariffs on the imports of any eu country that , in eu council , votes for zero tariffs on the uk or otherwise publicly calls for zero tariffs on the uk . 
  zero tariffs would be unprecedented in any case . 
  the eu acts as a block and therefore you can not chose to impose tariffs on certain members only . 
  you can either have your own fta or none . 
  the new fta will be discussed after the uk has left the union ; the gatt , gats and trips will apply until then . 
  this is merely a negotiation about when the uk leaves , not a negotiation about new free trade agreements . 
  this is merely a discussion about when the uk leaves , not a negotiation about a new free trade agreements . 
   ( 1 ) uk leaves the eu and the treaties on 1 march 2019 . 
  the eu can choose what to do with eba , ema etc. 
  uk and eu can agree between them all remaining payments in a single lump sum bloc . 
  the uk leaves 1.1.2017 . 
  ( asap )  ( 2 ) uk grants all eu citizens who have come to the uk prior to 1 june 2019 indefinite leave to remain .
