  and then you accused me of being a victim of left-liberal echochambers , because i corrected him . 
  i look at polls , official statements and i primarily consume faz , sueddeutsche , print-version of zeit , tagesschau . 
  if you really wan na put those on the same pedal as tabloids , fake facebook news and reddit memes , cool . 
  if you actually look at polls like above it would n't be a shock to you that merkel is still popular . 
  it has nothing to do with bias , it 's just the reality that merkel is somewhat popular and just because everyone on your facebook is writing that `` she is done '' does n't make your facebook the counter-weight to all the scientific polls . 
   the fdp feels like a throwaway vote at the moment , they really lost there . 
  maybe they somehow can revive . 
  maybe they can if you vote for them . 
   i 'm really shocked that she enjoys such high approval ratings . 
  that 's what happens when you spend too much time reading tabloids , facebook and reddit . 
   then the germans deserve to live in the shithole they create . 
  bulgaria flair . 
  okay then . 
  well , you clearly have no clue . 
  chancellor is just the third highest ranked government official . 
  there are term limits for the president who is the highest ranked one . 
  yes , polls being `` off '' by 2-4 % in a two way race and polls being off by 20 or 30 % in a system with proportional representation is exactly the same thing !, 
  anything can happen !!!!!!!!!!, 
   guideline amount of military expenditure . 
  which is n't an obligation and is supposed to be until 2025 . 
  getting treatment in an emergency is not really the same as access to medical care . 
  did i say anything else at any point ? 
  it 's already happening actually . 
  point is that someone who is in a country illegally is also unregistered . 
  you are probably mixing up illegal and unregistered people with people that do n't have a real residency claim , but are being tolerated . 
   the increase is minuscule you made it look like there were cuts . 
   they want to privatize the autobahn * selected parts of it . 
   the federal government should give the states much more money for education . 
  that 's not possible due to the kooperationsverbot . 
  also different states spend different amounts . 
  https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/content/de/bilder/bildstrecken/mediathek/infografiken/bundeshaushalt/2014/bundeshaushalt-2014-09.jpg?__blob=poster&amp;v=5 federal government is n't cutting money for education though . 
   something to shake people into fulfilling their obligations yeah , all the times article 5 is triggered and all the members do n't fullfill their obligation . 
  happens all the time ; an extremely rampant problem . 
  completely opposed to the non-problem that some nato members try to guilt other nato members to help them dicking around all around the world . 
  like in afghanistan . 
  glad nothing like that ever happened . 
  silly people thinking nato is just a military alliance ensuring none of its members get dicked . 
  it 's obviously meant to be the world police !, 
  assuming you know the right people . 
  do a few thousand know the right people ? 
  i doubt it . 
   they 're used to not having government support so it 's still a big step forward for them and allows any children they have to have a future in a developed nation . 
  how will the kids go to school if no one knows they are there ? 
   access to some of the best medical care in the world actually not because you wo n't get any treatment without an insurance card . 
   you can have essentially free money . 
  you should tell sch\u00e4uble that he can have ** free ** money !, 
  he must be so stupid not just taking the free money no one will ever have to pay back !, 
  point of the energiewende is getting rid of coal and nuclear energy . 
  let 's take a look at our favorite \u00d6kos . 
  http://www.gruene.de/themen/klima-schuetzen/kohleausstieg-und-saubere-autos.html oh look , our favorite \u00d6kobande does indeed not like coal !, 
  and as soon as we move back towards reality they do n't get warned beforehand anymore and the whole `` hiding in some random ass city '' is not exactly easy or fun or feasible for the people in question . 
  instead of writing here you could just take that question to your favorite search engine . 
  people that are `` against '' nuclear are probably `` against '' coal too though . 
  uhh , how about they just go where they live ? 
  considering they are registered and everything ? 
  how do you think deportations work ? 
   450 crimes related to refugees related to refugees or committed by them ? 
  also more people = more crime , that 's pretty basic tbh . 
  if 10 out of 100 do something that should n't reflect badly on the other 90 in my humble opinion . 
   as a principle non-citizens should be deported if they commit a crime ( above a low treshold ) . 
  which is already the case , but there are also reasons why it does n't always happen . 
  mostly because of guidelines and laws based on article 1 of basic law . 
  switzerland and norway are both in the eea and heavily associated with the eu and are also far from being relevant , like a g7 country for example is . 
  being the guy that begins his input with `` actually ... '' is pretty much the definition of being petty . 
  if you did n't know what petty means you could have googled it and we could 've just skipped this conversation . 
   200 million people out of 700 are not a negligible share of the population , but maybe `` vast '' means something different to you . 
  vast in this context means very great amount/number/quantity and 5 out of 7 is a vast fucking majority . 
   it 's actually not . 
  europe is a land area . 
  europe actually is a subcontinent . 
  again : getting upset when someone refers to the eu as europe is extremely petty . 
  500 million in the eu , 700 million in europe , looks like a vast fucking majority . 
  the only ones that actually do n't have anything to do with the eu , but sort of are in europe are moldova , russia , belarus , ukraine and kosovo . 
  the landmass is utterly irrelevant . 
  canada is bigger than the us , but people still talk about america and mean the us . 
  considering the vast majority of europe is part of it that 's sort of nothing to get upset about . 
  muller would indeed be a funny name ; did you maybe mean m\u00fcller ? 
   your grandpa was probably a nazi and a war criminal who ** killed many people for no reason ** _  as churchill once said `` germany need to be ** bombed around every fifty years ** or so '' . 
  will we get moneys after the justified bombings tho ? 
  the vast majority of european countries , especially relevant countries , is in the eu . 
  when people talk about europe they usually talk about the eu countries though ; like people that say america when talking about the usa . 
  the uk definitely was never a fundamental part of the eu . 
  it 's not baseless propaganda to say that benelux/france/germany + italy/spain are `` more '' part of the eu than the uk . 
  that 's not really true , especially not for the electorate . 
  it 's also hard to not be at the centre when you have the biggest population and the biggest economy . 
  other than that `` forcing ones way into the centre of european power '' is involvement in foreign politics , is n't it ? 
  so i guess we are taking the responsibility ? 
   refused to accept that she had made a mistake case in point . 
  she said that if she could dial time back she would prepare authorities better , not that she made a mistake . 
   most of the world does n't speak german . 
  merkel should 've been conscious of how her words were interpreted she is very obviously always conscious of what she says . 
  there is no blame to put on her if people completely spin the message ; you do n't even speak german , but you say she did n't chose her words wisely . 
   who is rearranging countries ? 
  the two of us . 
  you should read up on german history btw . 
   it was n't just foreign media . 
  it was domestic european media in multiple languages . 
  non-german media = foreign media . 
   why should ireland lose its independence ? 
  i thought we are re-arranging countries ?
