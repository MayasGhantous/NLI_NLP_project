  read the above comment again . 
  your source does n't even refer to what i said ? 
   the north african camps wat . 
  also pretty sure germany contributes a tiiiiiiiny bit more to humanitarian aid , especially in the countries of origin , than the rest of the eu . 
  just out of the 20 billion in the title more than 7 billion go towards improving the situation in the countries of origin . 
   inflating the egos of our leaders and trying to look generous . 
  well , we ** are ** more generous . 
  germany paid 3 times as much as the rest of the eu combined to camps for syrian refugees in the countries around syria . 
   we pay in far more than we get back . 
  you mean like several other countries . 
  how else it it supposed to work ya dingus . 
  also this is an entirely different thing . 
  we took a burden from everyone else and technically y' all should be payin ' up . 
  pronto . 
   you contribute disproportionately to something yeah , but you contribute a disproportionately low amount , even without the rebate . 
   when the uk got a rebate on something that cost us disproportionately wat . 
  you got a 30 % rebate just for being in the eu ya dingus . 
  germany has n't invaded any foreign countries for like 70 years now , do we get a pat on the back too ? 
   if you believe trump , 
  lmao . 
  uhh , would n't want any of those as chancellor . 
  except maaaaaybe \u00d6tzi . 
  ge and lindner would be fine in the cabinet , but not as chancellors . 
   you do n't know what gibraltar is ? 
  seriously ? 
  did you fail history or are you yet to take a history class ? 
  why the fuck would gibraltar even be relevant in any history class . 
   germany does n't meet the 2 % budget it agreed to hit , and it has no intention of doing so by 2020 . 
  in other words germany meets all obligations . 
   i do n't really reserve proper grammar for morons . 
  good point . 
  it 's really hard to differentiate between `` your '' and `` you are '' . 
  especially for a native speaker . 
   no the powerful navally able nations have an interest in protecting their own trade brent woods and wilsons proclamation on the right of free trade on the seas is only guaranteed by the americans ( to an extent by the british before ) should america take on a protectionist stance why would they protect a none allies trade ? 
  especially when the none ally fails to maintain any military power itself ? 
  it makes ships flying or broadcasting german ownership vulnerable . 
  that 's not how it works , my dear armchair expert . 
   also lol with an attitude like that enjoy being invaded and facing proxy insurgent forces battling inside germany . 
  again : lmao . 
  have a good day , bud . 
   if america steps back from protecting anything but american trade your fucked . 
  how ? 
  especially considering a ship belonging to a german company might have a indian crew and be registered in the us while transporting french baguettes or whatever they export . 
  nearly every country in the world has an interest in keeping sea trade routes safe . 
  also since english is your first language : it is `` you are fucked '' or `` you 're fucked '' . 
   who do you see as germany 's allies ? 
  there are none . 
  cute :3, 
  cute :3, 
   wo n't be able to protect its shipping a trade interests . 
  good thing germany uses the same routes everyone else does and germany is the only country interested in not having a bunch of pirates steal our goodies . 
   you seem quite happy to throw allies under the bus . 
  no , but i do n't see a lot of allies in nato . 
  germany meets all obligations . 
  hicks would be everyone else ... gibraltar for example , no idea wtf that even is . 
   i think it is our duty to keep `` protecting '' countries which vowed to protect us when we needed this protection . 
  sure , but for that nato needs to go back to its roots or needs reforms . 
  nato currently barely resembles an actual defensive alliance , it 's more of a geo-political pressure group and it 's questionable whether our interests line up . 
  i 'm pretty certain we are just going to see more iraqs , afghanistans and libyas . 
  as i said . 
  where is the apology though ? 
  there were several legal ways to lock anis amri up . 
   i also do n't see realistic scenarios for germany where the country is threatened but you never know ... 
  still , i think a change is necessary from attacking capabilities to defensive capabilities . 
  those are cheaper and more effective unless you plan on invading the middle east . 
  i agree . 
  which is why we should leave nato . 
   the 2 % defence investment ** guideline ** do you know what an obligation is ? 
   budget allocation is a national , sovereign decision also :  france , germany and the united kingdom together represent more than 50 per cent of the non-us allies defence spending , which creates another kind of over-reliance within europe on a few capable european allies . 
  lol . 
  i would love to leave . 
  i sadly ca n't control whether germany leaves or stays . 
  also you only have to defend yourself when you are actually being attacked which would n't happen , in or outside of nato . 
   also mate you realize i 'm british right ? 
  should have flaired up ; my point applies to the uk and all nato countries anyway . 
  it is also factually correct that hitler represented the german empire . 
   the difference is that you believe 2 % is a suggestion , i believe its an obligation . 
  [ the difference is that one of us is wrong . ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm ? ), 
  it 's not ridiculous , it 's sort of how the world works . 
  it 's not really about how big of a problem something is , it 's currently simply unlikely to happen because the only party i could see being in favor of something like that would be the cdu/csu and they would n't get a majority . 
  i never claimed there is anyone who does n't fullfill any obligations . 
  that would have been you . 
  instead of a participation award , maybe an apology from you ? 
  i actually think that germany does way too much for nato . 
  i think it 's is ridiculous that apparently a bunch of hicks think they can butt in on budgetary issues . 
  indeed . 
  your point being ? 
  or did you just want to play the hitler card ? 
  johnson is your current foreign minister , therefore he represents the uk , its people , its interests and its positions outside of the uk . 
  germany contributes more often voluntarily to missions that are n't in its primary interest though . 
  germany is also fullfilling every actual obligation . 
  the budgets of sovereign nations are rightfully none of your business or the business of nato pencil pushers . 
  other than the fact that it is simply about paying for the actual base , the economic effect on actual local companies is negligible . 
  and attitudes like the ones displayed here make me want to leave nato and understand why people in germany are against working together with the us . 
  i am talking specifically about the last few decades though . 
  also i am talking about germany specifically , not europe . 
  and germany de facto is n't threatened and wo n't be threatened in the future , in or out of nato . 
  yeah , considering they are your representatives they sort of do . 
  yeah , but they also clog up a decent amount of appartments i guess and a third of the cost of the bases is covered by the state . 
  same how taking in refugees is `` good for the economy '' because money is being spent .
