  my point still stands . 
  got the downdoots , but no one could point out any hard , real benefits for germany ( hint : there are none ) . 
  asking the parliament super nicely to do it . 
  8 months `` will i read about why people voted a eff deh and did suddenly everything change and merkel became the legislative and referendums a thing ? '', 
   anything is possible given enough support from the voters . 
  yeah , except she ca n't change laws you dingus . 
   call in a national referendum to change the constitution completely , if needed . 
  yeah , except that is n't a thing ya dingus . 
   lol , same was said about trump and brexit . 
  lol i guess it 's basically the same and everything is possible now , maybe we will see a roth/franz tag team too !, 
   either merkel changes the laws except that she ca n't do that . 
   afd gets elected and changes them for her . 
  it 's inevitable . 
  except that 's not gon na happen . 
  greece and poland reliable ? 
  is this a joke ? 
  i personally do n't care about a bunch of twats angrily shaking their fists . 
  as a matter of fact germany is contributing too much to nato . 
  this does n't contradict what i said . 
  that `` agreement '' is about as binding as all the `` combat climate change '' agreements . 
  it 's a goal you can ** try ** to reach . 
  except that we do n't get anything in return . 
  germany should actually leave nato and if you want cooperation you will have to pay to be allowed to have bases in germany . 
   when you make a deal , it is mandatory to keep to the terms of agreement . 
  it 's not part of the nato contract . 
   if there is no consequences for breaking the terms , that only means there are no consequences for breaking the terms . 
  that 's not how international deals work anyway . 
   you promise something , you keep it . 
  sure , but considering the promise is to ** try ** to spend around 2 % of ones gdp until sometime in the 2020 's . 
  there is no deal or agreement that has been broken or even can be broken . 
  except obviously the [ nato common defense budget ] ( http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pictures/stock_2015/20151019_1510_nato_common_funded_budgets_2016-2017.jpg ) . 
  but everyone is paying their fair share . 
  i meant political parties . 
  well , where do you see problems in the current laws ? 
  most importantly , if schulz is an opponent of free speech , who is n't ? 
  so you think libel and defamation should be legal ? 
  so he wants to enforce current laws and that makes him an opponent of free speech ? 
   i think his stances on free speech and internet freedom are unacceptable in a western democracy and he is more a cae for the verfassungschutz now you made everyone curious . 
  can you elaborate please ? 
  he is probably more willing to be the de facto `` leader '' than merkel and i imagine he would be more popular than merkel in southern europe . 
  it 's not that merkel does n't care about the eu , on the contrary , but i guess schulz cares even more and is somewhat more willing to shape things . 
  i think he meant that the cdu and afd will combined have a majority , not that they would actually form a coalition together . 
  the jamaica dream is still alive . 
  a decently sized one . 
  it also might have quite the impact . 
  i do . 
   then why is the pound falling in value being paraded as some sort of failure here ? 
  mostly because it was n't necessarily intended or controlled . 
  but it is n't de facto a good or bad thing . 
  sometimes you might wan na devalue your currency , sometimes you might wan na keep it stable and sometimes you just might want to increase the value . 
   why is it that obama doubled the us national debt , with essentially nothing to show for it . 
  trump proposing a moderate increase , for economic growth is being slated as a bad thing ? 
  obama came into office during the financial crisis . 
  a time when the us ( and the rest of the world ) absolutely needed an economic kickstart ( due to recession ) . 
  `` has nothing to show for it '' is also simply wrong considering the us economy only grew in the last few years and did fairly well compared to most other countries . 
  read my above comment again . 
  it 's not first and foremost about the size of economy or trade in general . 
  and even if it was , russia still has quite some potential . 
  well , you are still our little sluts for the next two years , qt . 
  it actually says `` transatlantic relationship '' . 
  it does n't refer to ttip . 
  it 's more of a `` whom would you like as friends '' ? 
  * world, 
  yes , and you are still part of it , qt . 
  that 's not what the question is about though . 
  it 's about political ties , not about economy and trade . 
  nice mental gymnastics you are doing there . 
  yourselves i guess . 
   the uk will be negotiating them over the next couple of years , and that 's where you are wrong , kiddo . 
  you should honestly just read all my above comments again , i do n't really feel like being pestered by your delusions . 
   we 've just left the eu nah , you have n't even started the negotiations , bud . 
   looking to aggresivly pursue trade deals with countries all over the world aggressively pursue is cute , but while the eu can actually negotiate them and already has them , you ca n't even start the negotiations . 
  as i said above . 
  you are delusional and not capable of a cohesive argumentation . 
   the only one who is even slightly shifting away from asia is the us slightly is an understatement and the us seems to be the slighlty most important member of the dreamy anglo-union . 
  the uk surely is n't shifting more towards the rest of the world than the eu . 
   global shift away from the eu and towards the anglosphere and asia . 
  also you are the ones shifting away from asia . 
  at least the us and the uk . 
  australia , canada and nz not so much . 
  as i said two or three times above . 
  you are a delusional and clueless dimwit not able to make a factual analysis of the situation . 
   you 've gone from trump crashing the economy to saying his policies will obviously stimulate growth no , maybe you might just wan na read the above comment again . 
  it seems like you either did n't read or understand it . 
   the us debt will never be paid back , at least not in full . 
  nice strawman that does n't have anything to do with what we are discussing . 
  australia , canada and nz are also all making trade deals with europe and asia . 
  the us pulled out of the one they were close to finishing and the uk ca n't even start negotiating one until it has left the eu , so it is indeed incredibly far away from having some new fancy trade deals with the rest of the anglo-gang . 
  trump also says a lot of things . 
  the fact that you cheer on as you walk into the abyss is incredibly sad . 
  please think of me in 10 or 20 years when you realize you have been bamboozled . 
  no , but i can spot a dimwit who does n't know what he is talking about . 
  as i said . 
  delusions . 
   that you are actively supporting the regime that is the single biggest thread to human rights . 
  dun care bout that . 
   [ ... ] that your intellectual property will be stolen . 
  [ ... ] is not done by individual companies but rather by the chinese government itself that actively copy foreign technology and then sells that tech to state loyal chinese companies . 
  you mean like the us ? 
  it 's not that china would be a good ally .
