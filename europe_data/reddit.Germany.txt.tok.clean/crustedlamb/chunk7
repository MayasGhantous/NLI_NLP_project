  i concede that it is a possibility , but i have doubts that whatever spying the bnd is doing in the us goes beyond tapping one or two phones in certain departments . 
   i just wish you could separate me from my government . 
  i do , but above you and another gentleman on the one hand pretend like there is some widespread and unfounded anti-americanism . 
   i do n't understand how you can believe that germany does n't spy on the us or any of their other ` friendly ' nations . 
  they better be doing that and they better not let themselves get caught too much . 
  especially considering germany was not welcome to be part of the anglo `` no spy + best friends '' gang . 
   you act like i 'm a huge nationalist that supports these wars . 
  no i do n't . 
   but , i suppose if you want to see me as the generic american so you can vent your hate and anger there 's nothing i can do to stop you . 
  you could have acknowledged that `` not voting for whom germans want '' and `` everyone spies on everyone how stupid that the perception gets more negative when the spying comes out '' are not legit points . 
  you can pretty clearly see which things influenced the perception of the us and instead of pretending like there is some widespread totally random and unfounded anti-americanism you could just acknowledge the correlation . 
  also you hopefully do understand the difference between the revelations from 2013/14 concerning the nsa/cia and germany and the claim `` every country spies on everyone '' . 
  take a peek at 2013/2014 and fuck off . 
  i guess the anti-german sentiment is incredibly strong in the us too . 
  just take a look at the_donald , worldnews and all the `` rightwing/politically incorrect '' subreddits . 
   are we really denying the common german mentality you find so much on this site that we both knows exists & evertbody reading this has expierienced ? 
  yeah , i will indeed go ahead and call bullshit on that . 
   you 're so smug you ca n't even concede the tinniest point if it risks either making america look good or germany bad . 
  what the fuck am i supposed to even concede ? 
  your point seemed to be `` something something unfounded anti-americanism in germany '' and i showed you two graphs which both clearly show that approval of the us correlates with things happening in real life . 
   are you just going to keep calling me stupid , deny it 's very existance with some random graphs & keep acting superior ? 
  well , you are either a troll or a broken lightbulb . 
   the fact that you just replied to me like i 'm a stupid american well ... how am i supposed to reply ? 
   [ deep-seated dislike/hate for us ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie4_407bde_9fdf787f07.png ) considering you do n't seem to understand ... iraq/cowboy dubya = low approval rating , obama = approval rating goes up to a crazy 80 % , nsa = approval goes down , trump = approval goes to an all time low . 
  there does seem to be some correlation , eh . 
  ...  a willful ignorance/misrepresentation of our historical relationship that sounds about right . 
  you pretend like germans are for some reason obligated to `` like '' ( ? ), 
  the us and us-americans . 
  and you seem to be baffled they do n't which is absolutely hilarious . 
  there 's no english word for it , but we call it `` realsatire '' . 
  zero introspection . 
   also never got why germany is one of the most anti-american countries in europe . 
  from the marshall plan helping rebuild it like i mentioned above [ ... ] help build germany into the stable & prosperous country it is today , but most germans online seem to fucking despise us . 
  [ i thought we already went over this .

   pastor says that once you take a puff of the weed , you will be on the pipe within 6 to 9 months , depending on the size of your city . 
  i 'd be really interested in the correlation between city size and dependency on the herb of the devil himself . 
   exit from both nato and eu defense treaties and declare `` everlasting neutrality '' that actually sounds nice . 
  lmao, 
  i honestly did n't know enough about the uk to chat shit a few months ago , but i personally think it indeed is pretty fun to watch people try to box outside of their league . 
  does n't the victim role and tough talk become tedious after a few months ? 
  but you could claim to be swabian :(, 
  well , if you are gon na go after your `` roots '' at least choose a decent part of germany . 
  like who would want to associate themselves with ... bavarians ? 
  bland beer , disgusting food , flag that gives you a headache , dumb dialect , mediocre cars , weird traditions and delusional politicans . 
  all of germany to claim as `` heritage '' and you seriously go for [ this ] ( http://www.muenchenkotzt.de/kotzen2016/bilderkotzen2016/zw%c3%b6lftertag/img_1203.jpg ) ? 
  i know you are desperate , but even mr. and mrs. v\u00f6lkisch have distanced themselves from h\u00f6cke . 
  you are allowed to stop defending him . 
  this guy used to be a history teacher ... 
   what will come after that ? 
  well , the plan i received from the welt\u00fcbernahmenbundesamtplanungskomitee says san escobar is the next nation to have its life sucked out by imperalistic killers . 
  see , if the arabs just forcefully occupied israel there would be a lot less trouble in the me !, 
  the israelis just need to be spoonfed that they do n't even deserve a nation they believe they deserve !, 
  and all that should have happened 30 years ago !, 
  black/green or jamaica hype ? 
   for example , if trump were to raise tariffs on german goods while simultaneously use american military leverage to force the germans to accept the tariffs without retaliation . 
  this will create jobs by making our domestic companies more competitive , and there wo n't be any blowback because the germans still depend on us to protect them . 
  sure , it sucks for the germans , but do you think most americans are going to care ? 
  pretty much everything you said is wrong . 
  first off , if you impose tariffs consumers just end up paying more . 
  if you put tariffs on other goods you might actually make yourself less competitive because it becomes more expensive to manufacture in the us . 
  secondly germany does n't need the us at all , as a matter of fact if germany decides to close down us bases like ramstein , the us will have to fart out a few new logistic centers and airbases somewhere around europe or forget about having any influence in the me , africa and europe . 
  why the hell would it be bad for germans if americans have to pay more for cars ? 
  what the fuck would you even do when germany just stopped selling any cars to you ? 
  drive a pick up truck with your hick friends in the back ? 
  wwii is actually ludwig xvi 's fault . 
  ludwig lead to french revolution lead to napoleon lead to conquering german states lead to german nationalism based on hatred for the french lead to unified german nation lead to the constellations that lead to wwi lead to wwii . 
   in addition to the physical barriers that had to be overcome for the west german economic recovery , there were also intellectual challenges . 
  the allies confiscated intellectual property of great value , all german patents , both in germany and abroad , and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to allied companies ...  immediately after the german surrender and for the next two years , the u.s. pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in germany . 
  john gimbel 's book `` science technology and reparations : exploitation and plunder in postwar germany '' concludes the `` intellectual reparations '' taken by the u.s. and the uk amounted to close to $ 10 billion . 
  ...  meanwhile , thousands of the best german researchers and engineers were working in the soviet union and in the u.s. ( see operation paperclip )  the marshall plan was only extended to western germany after it was realized the suppression of its economy was holding back the recovery of other european countries and was not the main force behind the wirtschaftswunder . 
  had that been the case , other countries such as the united kingdom , which received much greater economic assistance than west germany , should have experienced the same phenomenon . 
  ...  the demands of the korean war in 1950 -- 53 led to a global shortage of goods that helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of west german products . 
  at the time west germany had a large pool of skilled labour , partly as a result of the deportations and migrations which affected up to 16.5 million germans . 
  and again , put on your thinking , introspection and research cap . 
  hints : ramstein air base , nsa , iraq , middle east , trump . 
  [ peeeeeeeeeeeeew ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie4_407bde_9fdf787f07.png ) [ i wonder what france is doing right ] ( https://www.welt.de/img/politik/mobile121660182/6441627587-ci23x11-w1280/dtrend-usa.jpg ), 
  you might wan na read it again , bud . 
  and put on your thinking/introspection cap again . 
   we rebuilt your country with the marshall plan [ wrong . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wirtschaftswunder )  yet you 're one of the most anti-american countries in europe maybe germans are unreasonable . 
  or maybe ... just maybe there are other reasons . 
  put on your thinking cap , maybe ( with some introspection ) you can come up with one or two other reasons . 
  hint : focus especially on the last two decades . 
  except that both the good people of francia and rossija would probably be on the same side as germany . 
  you are in big trouble if your success relies on trump . 
   cricket we 're ranked 5th in the world sweet , we uncivilized fucks do n't even have a cricket team . 
  i am sure you are great at cricket and quidditch too . 
   i cant imagine how would you force east germany or czechoslovakia to fight against nato . 
  i am 100 % certain that at least the gdr was absolutely willing to do so . 
  yes , i forgot how popular running and swimming and all the other often watched and closely followed olympic sports are . 
   america destroys itself they just point their finger to avoid the fact that they are 100 % of their own problem . 
  fixed it . 
   the uk is more than ready to play ball . 
  cute . 
  not football though . 
   the eu and its residents then decided they want the uk to fail and to ultimately split up into multiple countries . 
  no , the eu is waiting for you to actually leave . 
  the rhetoric from uk press and politicans towards the eu is a lot more hostile , i have seen english expressing the wish for the eu to fail one or two times more than someone hoping the uk `` fails '' . 
   the eu is a crumbling and we all know it .
