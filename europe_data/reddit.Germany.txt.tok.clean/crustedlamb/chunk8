  britain is more than ready for a trade war , bring it on . 
  no , you are n't ready . 
  you seem to be the hostile one here . 
   i really do n't care . 
  europeans have shown their true colours and britain will respond . 
  we are more than ready for a trade war . 
  i want britain to slash its corporation tax rates , with that and trump 's american on our side , i am very confident we 'll come out on top  i am fairly confident that trade wars tend to end badly for everyone and you come up `` on top '' by being competitive . 
  neither trump 's yankyland nor slashing corporation taxes are going to make you competitive . 
  i personally do wish you all the best , especially when it comes to overcoming your inferiority complex . 
  some people love to be the victim . 
  everything is someone else 's fault . 
  stop opressing him and being mean to him . 
  trump and may are going to form the anglo-tag team and start ( trade ) wars with the rest of the world !, 
  just wait and see !, 
  well , thanks for providing proof that supports my claims ? 
  the fact that you think you were entitled to any help in afghanistan or iraq says pretty much everything . 
  your post sounds like satire to me and just the fact that i ca n't be entirely sure whether you are being serious is incredibly sad and proves what i said . 
   nrw flair, 
  germany is n't leeching from anything , as a matter of fact the us relies more on nato and what it brings than germany . 
  you could n't even have invaded iraq and you wo n't be able to invade shit in the africa/me without your bases in germany . 
  other than that is russia neither capable to even try reaching to germany nor is russia interested in it anyway . 
  as i said , all you should be saying is `` sorry '' and `` thank you '' . 
  well , the increased media attention and the fact that vw is n't really acting smart and possibly because some of the punishments in certain countries are partly politically motivated . 
  technically car manufacturers [ have been busted before . 
  ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/carmaker-cheating-on-emissions-almost-as-old-as-pollution-tests ), 
   we do n't have to lie to get people to buy our shit . 
  actually pretty much every manufacturer makes inaccurate claims on emissions and fuel efficiency . 
  other than that mercedes/bmw/audi fill a niche in which your `` sturdy '' cars do n't even compete in . 
  it 's funny because german car manufactures , especially bmw whom he called out , already manufacture a lot of their na models in the us . 
  the biggest car factory in the us is a bmw one . 
  other than that consumers are just going to pay more and bmw/audi/mercedes fill a specific niche anyway . 
   even an average german can run the us govt better than he can . 
  i legitimately think that 's true tbh . 
  just not starting trade wars and antagonizing your 4 biggest trade partners would probably already be a better economic policy . 
  or focusing on building a connection to the actual governments of other countries , not to opposition parties . 
  or just listening to people with experience and be aware that you may or may not have strengths , but others have theirs too so maybe you should n't pretend like you know everything . 
  even a us-president just spending his time digging holes on the beach and being a smart-ass might actually be more beneficial to the us . 
  kia 's are n't technologically innovative though . 
  i have added another paragraph . 
  the `` personal insult '' is still in there . 
   but do n't expect others to `` defend '' in afghanistan , prick . 
  she was in the opposition though so her actions did n't contribute anything . 
  you could argue that the schr\u00f6der government should have just thrown the us-bases out of germany and by doing that could have at least delayed the war . 
  yes i did , but the kia models that are comparable to a vw golf are not luxury vehicles . 
  i am not entirely sure , but i do n't think that kia produces cars in the price range of phaetons . 
  and in the end of the day daimler and bmw fight for the # 1 spot in the luxury segment and audi is the third one . 
   well , a 30k kia just is n't a luxury car . 
  if ** you ** feel like it is , fine , but ** i ** highly doubt ** a lot of people ** think of kia or vw as luxury car manufacturers . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5oa7bd/germanys_vice_chancellor_rejects_trumps_claim/dchts03/  well , a 30k kia just is n't a luxury car .

  fraud ? 
  no ; inaccurate data ? 
  yeah . 
  you mean like every manufacturer does , my dear germanophobic stuijfsande . 
  vw is not a luxury car brand either . 
  a vw phaeton might be a luxury car , a vw golf is n't . 
  well , google has a market share of 90 % in europe and arguably can already heavily influence the information you get . 
  i guess it 's one of the current challenges of internet related politics to prevent google and facebook from de facto from determining the flow of information . 
  it would also be a start to be a lot more anal about privacy and data collection . 
  google collecting payload data from open wi-fi networks with its cute colorful google street view cars either already breaks a law and needs to be thoroughly or there has to be a law that makes that type of stuff illegal . 
   at ** increased expense ** kia might offer good bang for your buck but it 's just is not a luxury brand ; daimler has the biggest share in the premium segment , followed by bmw and then audi . 
  there is no such thing as `` lower class luxury car '' . 
  entry level luxury cars would be bmw 3er or audi a4 . 
  they should n't necessarily be broken up , but facebook und google are getting scary amounts of influence and power imo . 
  a kia is not a status symbol or a luxury car . 
  luxury and lower class are contradictions . 
  the type of person who is interested in buying a 5er bmw is n't suddenly going to decide to get himself a kia niro . 
  not when it comes to luxury , upper middle-class cars . 
  bmw/mercedes/audi own that market . 
  i only have a [ german source ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/amerika-will-eigen-wirtschaft-vor-japan-schuetzen-14621712.html ) from a few days ago right now . 
  basically the us wanted to protect their own car manufacturers so they imposed a limit on how many motorcycles and cars could be imported from japan and imposed tariffs . 
  the japanese were already manufacturing quite a few cars and motorcycles in the us , made the imported vehicles more expensive and later just reduced the amount of parts they would export to the us , making them more expensive in the us and making companies manufacturing in the us less competitive and also made room on the world market for more non-american competitors . 
  the japanese actually kept most of the quotas and tariffs for a few years , even after the us dropped them again . 
  basically japanese companies made more profit at the cost of american consumers . 
  and when you want companies to assemble things in your country you should make sure they can also get the parts they need cheaply . 
  read the comment you replied to again . 
  you can `` bomb '' a synagogue because one of the people going there kicked your dog . 
  you can `` bomb '' a synagogue because the guy your gf cheats on you with goes there . 
  you can `` bomb '' a synagogue because you dislike jews . 
  you can `` bomb '' a synagogue because you feel like the building is ugly and your goal is to make the city pretty . 
  you can also `` bomb '' a synagogue because you connect it to the state of israel and you yourself have a great amount of spite for israel and its politics . 
  synagogues might be primarily a jewish symbol , but in this particular case the primary reason for targeting this synagogue was because it was also symbolic for israel . 
  well , it is the greens and parts of the left organizing it . 
  together they make up about 20 % of the electorate . 
  it 's like saying there are people in the us protesting against war and therefore the us is against war . 
  also if you take out `` chlorine chickens '' and `` gmo '' the greens wo n't even be against free trade , so you are left with 9 % socialists who will either rot in the opposition forever or move more to the center . 
  historically the reason germany is doing well economically and developed well from the 50 's on were liberal and open trade policies . 
  other than that , political isolation is to some degree everyone 's loss , but especially economic isolation is the part where the jokes and fun end . 
  mercantilism is suicide . 
  well , it 's not about nato , but about the hostile rhetoric . 
  i do n't think anyone in germany has sympathy or even comprehends the claims and accusations of trump . 
  especialy the `` eu = 4th ryke '' claim is incredibly hostile and it does n't just go against anyone who supports or is fine with the eu , it also contradicts and goes against the point of view of people critical of the eu . 
  even the afd does n't want to leave the eu . 
  also while tariffs on german luxury cars ( assembled in mexico ? ), 
  would probably just backfire for the us , like it backfired in the 80s in regards to japanese cars and motorcycles , it 's still symbolically hostile . 
  also out all the things you could do to piss off people and politicians in germany is restricting trade , the reason for existence of the frg is to export shit tons and have as open and liberal as possible trade policies .
