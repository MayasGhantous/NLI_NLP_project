  you might as well question whether taiwan is a sovereign nation or whether it 's part of china ... 
  no nato countries should have even sent 1 single soldier to afghanistan . 
  nato is a defense pact , afghanistan is neither a nato country nor was it threatening a nato country . 
  you should be damn ashamed even thinking about saying anything but `` sorry '' and `` thank you '' when it comes to fallen non-us nato soldiers in afghanistan . 
  other than the fact that there were two different operations , the uk had twice as many soldiers in afghanistan than germany , but nine times as many dead . 
  also afghanistan was mainly an american thing , no eu countries had any primary interest in it and just got dragged into it . 
  technically no one but the us should have send even 1 soldier to afghanistan . 
  the reason nato is unpopular in germany is because isaf had nothing to do with defending any nato country and `` our freedom '' surely did n't have to be `` defended at the hindukush '' . 
  well , the city it is named after is not yours :3, 
  hamburgers are considered an american speciality . 
  the two soldiers on the left are american and are smaller and do n't look as fit as the two polish soldiers on the right . 
  therefore pierogi = good nutritious food that makes you tall and strong ; hamburgers = trash food , unhealthy , not nutritious, 
  god bless the queen . 
  you realize that they just plan to have a `` research team '' that will look at posts that have been reported `` fake '' and will then flag dubious `` news '' as `` a third party thinks this story is false '' . 
  also we are n't talking about anti-immigrant posts in the first place . 
  whether spending time talking about fake news is a different discussion , pretending like freedom of speech and opinion is threatened is ridiculous though . 
  the legal framework is n't changing ; facebook , a private company that by the way can do whatever they want in terms of censorship anyway , is just changing its policy . 
  but the ger\u00e4t is in the shop before the owner . 
  the ger\u00e4t does n't get tired . 
  the ger\u00e4t does n't sweat . 
  you are a flawless democrat . 
  [ they already exist .

  what do you mean ? 
  they will form the anglo-saxon empire due to their * special relationship * . 
  especially with a us-president who spends more time talking to the leaders of opposition parties than with the actualy british government . 
  yank-limey tag team incomiiiiiiiiiiing !, 
   that 's patently false . 
  i ca n't grasp how you can legitimately argue that the eu would be worse off without the uk than the uk outside of the eu . 
  do you have some secret plan ? 
  what do you know that no one else knows ? 
   the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ uk needs to shoulder the blame for their unreasonable and inflexible attitude . 
  a surprisingly spot on article , especially considering it 's in english . 
   https://clients.rte-france.com/lang/an/visiteurs/vie/prod/indisponibilites.jsp nah , it says there are right now 6 unavailable due to shit steel and it has been 10 since december . 
   i 've refuted every single on of them already . 
  but all i said is that tihange has and has had several problems which is objectively true . 
  saying it has less problems compared to earlier or relative to other shit plants does n't refute my point . 
  the point is that tihange is not running as planned which is objectively true . 
  if you have to bring your car to more than a routine check your car obviously has problems . 
   we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness . 
  and you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do . 
   `` i do n't believe it . '', 
  that 's what you said . 
  you pretend like there are and nevr were problems at tihange and you pretend like france does n't have several plants off the grid right now . 
  you have n't proven any of that wrong . 
   unlike you i 'm informed on the subject , literally everything you 've said is objectively wrong . 
  feel free to refute the above links . 
  one of them is exactly about the `` objetively right facts '' . 
  do n't forget to clean out your ears if you ever decide to take your head out of the sand . 
  you might wan na read all the above comments again while wearing your thinking cap . 
   the amount of incidents is lower than it was in the past at least you got past the denial that everything is fine and nothing ever happened . 
  impressive !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tihange_nuclear_power_station  on 12 december 2016 engie electrabel announced that tihange-1 could not be restarted before 15 february 2017 . 
  the original date planned was 31 december 2016 . 
  [ 19 ] the reconstruction works could not be completed in time . 
  ...  on 7 september 2016 tihange 1 was shut down , because one building of the plant had been damaged during construction works . 
  two days later , tihange 2 was also shut down because a failure occurred in the steam generator in the `` non-nuclear '' part of the plant . 
  it is not known how long the repair will take . 
  tihange-1 was expected to be taken into service again on 11 september 2016 . 
  [ 17 ] three months later the problems around tihange-1 were still not solved . 
  in neighboring countries the demands to close all belgian reactors were growing , but the belgian authorities - depending on nuclear power , as they were - refused all requests . 
  `` the problems were in the non-nuclear-departments '' . 
  [ 18 ] ...  february 23 , 2015 , dutch newspaper reports on thousands of cracks well up to 6 cm according to federaal agentschap voor nucleaire controle ( fanc ) . 
  [ 14 ] actual discussion still assumes the reactor to be turned on in july again . 
  this did not happen , and in september 2015 the unit is still offline pending further investigation . 
  ...  on november 22 , 2002 , an incident occurred in block 2 ( ines 2 ) . 
  the reactor was shut down at this time and no longer critical . 
  however it remained necessary for decay heat to be removed from the reactor by circulating coolant . 
  the november 22 incident involved accidental opening of a pressure relief valve . 
  this caused the high pressure primary coolant circuit to rapidly depressurize , therefore reducing the ability of the circuit to remove heat from the reactor ( the high pressure prevents the coolant - water - from boiling ) , leading to possible reactor overheating and eventual meltdown . 
  the pressure relief valve was closed again after three minutes . 
  ...  in august 2015 4 people of the staff of tihange were suspended for some time . 
  in six weeks time , there had been 10 incidents on the tihange powerplant . 
  in cooperation with electrabel an actionplan for safety was made . 
  in the opinion of wagner , the spokesman of fanc , it had `` many good points '' . 
  [ 20 ]  in december 2015 , police found that a camera had been set up outside the house of a sck \u2022 cen nuclear researcher to track their movements . 
  [ 21 ] [ 22 ] seven people had their access to the tihange and doel facilities revoked after the 2016 brussels police raids in march 2016 , [ 23 ] and during the 2016 brussels bombings , the tihange and doel nuclear power station facilities evacuated non-essential personnel . 
  [ 24 ]  on 25 march 2016 , a g4s security guard for the national institute of radio-elements ( ire ) in fleurus died in a shooting when he walked with his dog in charleroi . 
  [ 25 ] [ 26 ] his security cards were stolen . 
  [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] the cards , which give access to nuclear sites in belgium , were deactivated shortly after the killing was discovered . 
  [ 30 ] [ 31 ] belgium denied that the guard 's death was terror related . 
  [ 32 ]  on 26 may 2016 it was found that one of the systems to measure the pressure inside the cooling-circuit did not function . 
  when unexpected pressure fluctuations occur it might be needed to halt the whole nuclear power station . 
  this was scaled as ines-1 incident . 
  it was called an `` irregularity '' . 
  four days later on 30 may it was discovered that a measuring station for radioactivity in the control room of tihange 3 had been in `` testmode '' for days and as a consequence did not work at all . 
  the safety was not in direct danger , because there was another backup system active . 
  nevertheless fanc scaled this incident also as ines-1 . 
  of these two incidents an official legal report was made . 
  in the view of fanc was the staff had been negligent , while there were serieus questions about the safety culture . 
  maybe i am a complete retard but this says pretty much what i said . 
  it actually has n't been debunked with a source . 
  and my point stands , there were problems and there will be problems in the future . 
  [ look ] ( https://www.stop-tihange.org/en/wp-content/uploads/report_en.pdf ) everything everyone said debunked !!!, 
  http://www.dw.com/en/new-incident-at-belgiums-tihange-2-nuclear-plant/a-19323647 http://www.dw.com/en/fire-shuts-down-belgiums-tihange-nuclear-reactor/a-18929156 http://www.inrag.org/publications-and-meetings/pressure-vessel-cracking-doel-tihange-follow-up, 
  they are the source of the english wikipedia . 
  if the wikipedia article is plain wrong i hope one of you corrects it . 
  i am not looking to convince anyone . 
   people have adequatly explained , but you appear stuck in some medieval witchhunt mode . 
  k. all the english and german sources have more or less supported my claims , but a bunch of redditors telling me nothing happened because the ones who are running the plants say so somehow is an adequate explanation .
