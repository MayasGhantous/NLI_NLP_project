so germany is fine with nuclear warheads on its soil but nuclear power plants are a potential catastrophe waiting to happen ? 
  many germans are very uneasy about the nuclear weapons and the fact that bundeswehr tornados are equipped to carry them ( in fact the previous foreign minister had lobbied for their removal and had received rather broad public support - did n't help him in the polls , though ) . 
  until recently it was n't even clear whether or not germany would spend money to update the tornados to carry the updated b61s ( or enable the eurofighters to carry them ) , but this would have been another affront towards the us and nato and apparently the government did n't want this at this point . 
  imo the german rejection of nuclear technology is based not just on the disasters of tchernobyl and fukushima or the constant threat of nuclear devastation throughout the cold war . 
  it 's also based on the specifically german experience that the large energy corporations and their supporters among the political scene are ripe with filth , corruption , backroom deals and shady behaviour . 
  many are convinced that the nuclear power stations here have been used to make exceptional gains for the companies while the society had to pay enormous sums for dealing with the nuclear waste . 
  it 's a complex mix of many things , even though only the security issues get media attention . 
  all true , but then you may have mistaken the intention of this `` enterprise '' . 
  it 's not about gaining useable cross-border military capabilities . 
  for the dutch it 's an exercise in retaining/preserving a minimum of tank warefare experience and knowldge on the cheap as well as gaining experience for officers working on the level of divisional staffs ( which , afaik , the dutch military no longer has on its own - which is why 11 amb was integrated into the german dsk , too ) . 
  for us germans ... well , it 's a bit more complicated . 
  the person to first voice the suggestion was rainer arnold , member of the bundestag , who happens to have bergen ( where the unit is to be based ) as his `` home '' electoral district . 
  bergen would have suffered greatly with the brits leaving and now he 's managed to get some `` replacement '' . 
  personal gain for him . 
  secondly it allows german politicians to engage in `` symbolic policies '' , they raise a new tank battalion ( while at the same time restructuring two of the old into a panzergrenadier and a j\u00e4ger battalion ) as `` demonstration '' , less to russia than to the rest of europe that they do '' * something * '' . 
  someone on the ground in bergen has reported the presence of two companies ' worth of tanks there already ... which makes me wonder which unit ( s ) had to give up tanks for that ? 
  where are they missing right now ? 
  i mean , that `` increase '' of tank numbers by a hundred is supposed to happen in two or three years ( although the question of those being upgraded to a6 or a7 standards has yet to be answered ) . 
  bottom line : it does n't cost the dutch much and allows german politicians to keep pretending . 
  win-win for both ... , 
  do you know the parable of the arguing body parts ? 
  it kinda fits ... 
  the various parts of the body are arguing which one is the most important . 
  heart , brain , liver , stomach , arms , legs ... all are putting forth good arguments why they are the most important . 
  but then the asshole steps forward and declares `` if i do n't do my job you 're all bust . '', 
  the rest of the body parts laughed at him and so the asshole went on strike . 
  and lo and behold - soon the entire body malfunctioned . 
  and the morale of the story ? 
  you do n't need to be good at what you 're doing or be important , you just need to be an asshole and willing to go up against other people . 
  and that certainly fits gabriel like a glove . 
  ditto here . 
  no interested in it . 
  the airbus ceo `` major tom '' enders has been crybabying for years now ... about political influence , about european customers not ordering enough , yada yada yada . 
  tune him out , at some point he becomes inaudible just like background noise . 
  yawn ... another unconvincing piece arguing for military interventionism because of ... what exactly ? 
  because the author 's favourite political theory demands it ? 
  in case prof. meade has n't realized - the recent `` interventions '' have n't left exactly happy people behind . 
  it 's the aftermath of said military campaigns that has us westerners puzzled and given the amount of dysfunction in these middle east societies why would anyone believe nation-building would work ? 
  so what would military intervention achieve ? 
  re-installing a powerful dictator who keeps things under wraps for another twenty years , then rinse and repeat ? 
  intense discussion on augengeradeaus.net ... everyone 's puzzled . 
  some suggest that jane 's fell prey to some `` theoretical exercise '' in a publication of the german defense industry . 
  it 's highly unlikely that anything like this happens anytime soon , because of manpower and financial issues , not to mention that the regular infantry is still facing a massive lack of `` normal '' boxer apcs . 
  apart from this the boxer ifv has a lower dismount strength than the `` normal '' one which would not work with the structure of the infantry squad in germany ( the `` normal '' boxer has a dismount strength of 7 ) . 
  it would work for the panzergrenadier units as their squad consists of 6 dismounts and a 3-man vehicle crew but they are supposed to get the puma . 
  it 's all a bit puzzling . 
  i guess you all understand now why us krauts did n't want that idiot in domestic german politics and why we had to dispose of that political hazardous waste to brussels . 
  to make something clear : i am with the brits on this `` ever closer union '' bullshyte . 
  german politicians loath the idea of ever having a serious and honest debate about the eu because they fear being told in no uncertain terms to cut back the `` heads in the clouds '' nonsense and do their job for germany ( and not some undefined cloud castle in brussels ) . 
  the problem of the uk is that its politicians are trying to be `` a little bit pregnant '' with regards to the eu and lately even more with its own international role ( comparable to what german politicians do wrt the military ) . 
  meaning they talk the talk but are unwilling , unable or do n't care about walking the walk . 
  all the while complaining about us continentals . 
  i mean i can understand and relate to the british unwillingness to transfer sovereignty ( i wish we had a serious democratic party in germany that advocates this view ) but their politicians do n't give the impression of being particularly skilled at explaining their views and even less in negotiating . 
  and `` dave '' is just the latest and perhaps worst example of this species . 
   there 's no point in trying to take ` leadership ' ( if this is even possible ) when your viewpoint is diametrically opposed to that of the nations you are supposedly to be leading . 
  ah , so the little document the press photographed when eu sanctions against russia were first discussed , you know the one with `` financial services and * the city * must be exempted from said sanctions '' , was merely a fun photoshop creation , was n't it ? 
  let 's be frank - the uk is n't seen as a leader because the other eu members do n't see it behave like one . 
  it 's either detached-indifferent or obstructionist depending on whether an issue touches them or not . 
  and in the case of the ukraine the uk was just as focused on protecting their national interests just as any other eu member . 
  quite honestly : fiscal redistribution is so far outside even the tiniest possibility at this moment precisely because nobody in germany is prepared to `` gamble away '' the economic dynamism and fiscal breathing space - which both will be sorely needed due to the changing international economic landscape and the demographic realities - for mere `` promises '' and an etheric concept such as `` european federalism '' . 
  fact is the german people were never allowed to voice their opinions directly - not on the introduction of the euro ( french geopolitical blackmail led to helmut kohl saying `` i had to act like a dictator over the euro as there was no way i 'd have gotten a democratic mandate for it '' ) and certainly not on the mere question whether or not the german constituency is even willing to go the `` ever closer union '' route with all the pitfalls and risks this contains ( which , conveniently , no pro-european politican is willing to outline in great detail - one could frighten voters off ) . 
  i , personally , am dead against a federalisation . 
  instead i favor the `` europe of sovereign countries '' and a limited role for the eu itself ( pretty much like the brits want it ) . 
  but to answer your points specifically ... * ** refugees ** - i do n't think you should see this willingness to accept refugees as a `` blank cheque '' for anyone to come . 
  it may , of course , serve as a pull factor but in reality the german government merely wanted to take some of the load off the southern states . 
  as to why germans welcome refugees ... 
  i think it 's a type of `` avoiding to be labeled a closet nazi '' . 
  it remains to be seen how long this `` honeymoon period '' will last , though . 
  i 'm taking a wait-and-see attitude here . 
  * ** federal union ** - like i said german politicians seem to * assume * that this is the logical end state of the eu , but they never bothered to ask their own voters ( in fact they 're afraid of asking us ) . 
  at the same time each and every eu member state is in it to serve its own national interests and `` get the most '' out of eu membership . 
  and i doubt many ( any ? ), 
  states would be willing to go this route because of the compromises everyone would have to agree to . 
  i also think such an idea is generations of not centuries too early , the time and the environment for this is n't there . 
  * ** `` control '' ** - retroactively applied motivation , in my opinion it 's much more correct to say the current setup allows germany to keep control of its own purse . 
  * ** fiscal distribution ** - see my comments above . 
  after the harrowing experience ( not yet completed ) of integrating east germany germans are n't willing to agree to an even larger transfer mechanism based on far less `` hard data '' . 
  the response to the greek crisis was largely based on this ... * ** refugee housing ** - again you need to look closer - the german government did n't give everyone and his dog a * quid pro quo * but merely tried to take some of the load the southern european states are feeling . 
  at some point the german load bearing capacity will be full , too , and at that point merkel will have to come clean both to her own people and the international scene . 
  it depends on what exactly poland wants . 
  for the baltic a smaller and silent type ( such as type 212a ) would be ideal for `` the usual stuff submarines do ''  ... 
  but i 've read several times before that poland actually eyes a larger type with the ability to launch cruise missiles to gain a conventional second strike capability . 
  i do n't know if that really makes sense , given how shallow the baltic sea is and how limited the polish financial means are given their own plans and requirements . 
  the french army has always served french interests . 
  that `` europe '' bit was merely a label slapped on some ops in order to push other eu members to play auxiliaries . 
  with very minor success , if i may say so ... 
   germany fucked up just about as bad as any country could ever fuck up . 
  here we agree . 
  but : germans , and i am talking about the ordinary people and not the suited cockatoos in the parliament , have no interest in being `` powerful '' , thank you very milking much . 
  various polls have revealed that solid majorities have no interest in `` greater engagement '' ... and politicians of all kinds are scratching their heads why no amount of lobbying seems to work . 
  as for the reasons you misinterpret the situation once again ... the `` national trauma '' is an overused mirage . 
  those traumatized where those who survived the 2nd world war , most germans today were n't alive back then . 
  the stance against military measures to achieve political goals is not based on a personal trauma , it 's based on a cultural ** default state ** , this is the `` normality '' we germans grow up with . 
  it has its roots back in 1945 , yes , but today it 's a simple `` reality '' of political and social life over here . 
  most think so '' * because it 's never been different * '' ( in living memory ) . 
   deployment in the east is about preventing a conflict , not provoking one . 
  given the paranoia wide stretches of the russian military and political scene i believe it would enter into a tit-for-tat race of responses that would build more tensions until some kind of `` solution '' at `` some point '' . 
  why ? 
  because russia is suffering from a bad case of wounded pride and the same encirclement phobia that drove german militarism in the wilhelminian empire . 
  problem is they have nuclear weapons these days and have even openly admitted of having lowered the threshold for using them ...
