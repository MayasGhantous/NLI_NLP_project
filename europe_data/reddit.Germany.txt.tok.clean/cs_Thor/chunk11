  to make a point vs russia ? 
  or is it because of lost transit fees ? ), 
  kicks in my personal defensive mechanism of `` not letting anyone else tell me what i have to think '' , something i developed growing up in the gdr . 
  a question to most people here would probably say no ... illiberal , irrational , nationalistic , misguided , feeling phantom pains over dropping from superpower status , prone to militaristic d * ck waving contests ... yes all that ( and probably some more ) , but not inherently evil . 
  back to nord stream ii ... 
  it 's simply not a topic of discussion here in germany , most people do n't particularly care either way . 
  build it , do n't build it ... it would n't have much of a direct impact on most people 's lives , anyway . 
  i can do that as well : it may actually be cheaper to build it through the sea where no other country can get its grubby hands on it and demand transfer fees . 
  it 's a long-term perspective , though . 
  i 'll let you in on a secret : most germans could n't care less about nord stream ii . 
   how much help does germany or the eu provide for french operations in the mena region currently ? 
  the real support is provided by the usa , not by germany . 
  correct , but you need to understand how french authorities have lobbied ( at times even tried to bully ) germany into subscribing to their very own view of the world ( including the interventionist attitude of the french foreign policy and defense establishment ) . 
  your government has been trying to transfer its own `` strategic culture '' to the rest of europe since at least the late 1990s and because germany is simply the biggest of the `` rest '' ( the uk excluded since they 're decidedly atlanticist which does n't sit that well with neo-gaullist attitudes at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e - palace and quai d\u2019orsay despite the lancaster house treaty ) . 
  if you look at the history of the eu agricultural subsidy policy and its setup you 'll notice how france has always been one of its biggest recepients of money out of that particular pot . 
  and given the multitude of protest french peasants have staged over the past few months due to `` unfair '' international competition i 'd say france has an integral interest in preserving this agricultural subsidy policy ( which many other eu members want reformed ) because otherwise its own peasants would be forced to acknowledge that it 's no longer 1980 , that the artificial `` ecosystem '' of french agriculture would not work without the massive outside help from brussels and that reforms and adaptation to competition from all over the world is far overdue . 
  those are only two aspects of a much larger conflict between the french and british attitudes about what the eu `` federalism '' is supposed to look like . 
  france has its model of a centralized presidential republic and wants as much of that transplanted on the eu while london views the eu along the french lines as a direct threat to its national interests ( namely retaining sovereignty ) . 
  and germany ? 
  is n't thrilled about french etatism , statism and centralism one bit but has to pay lip service to `` eu federalisation '' due to the overwhelming political correctness in our media . 
  she wo n't ... and the reason is not just the loss of face but rather the complete lack of suitable replacements ( which is why she does n't face any realistic opposition in her own party right now ) . 
  it would throw all of germany for a loop , economy included , and that would lead to a renewed ( and much worse ) euro crisis and potentially a complete breakdown of any european cooperation . 
   why should germany expect anything from france ? 
  eh , because french authorities expect a helluva german engagement in their ( french ) foreign interventions ? 
  because they expect germany to accede to french ideas about how the `` common security and defense policy '' for the eu should look like ( aka eu member states provide money , troops and political backing to french-led interventions in the mena region ) ? 
  because they expect german support over their resistance to reforming the eu along british lines of thought ( less etatism , less centralism , less subsidies - especially in the agricultural sector in which france depends on the current system not to suffer a breakdown ) ? 
  regardless of how one views merkel 's words ( and i am in the * `` wtf ? 
  '' * camp ) one thing remains an undeniable fact : the eu has always been a market for trading political compromises , a `` i help you here , help me there '' kind of thing . 
  so when france will not support german ideas here ( and that is perfectly understandable ) then there will be a political price to be paid and i bet the next time hollande ( or whoever follows him as president ) comes to berlin to ask for help to intervene here or there he 'll face stony faces , too . 
  that 's the reality of the eu ... * one hand washes the other *, 
   even if it were to change based on those two criteria however , it just shows that germany is content to rely on america doing the heavy lifting without pulling its own weight . 
  which , if i may remind you , was exactly the setup that our european neighbors and the us wanted after 1945 . 
  the roots of this `` not my problem '' attitude to international developments among the society ( visible in the pew poll - and a late effect of decades of foreign admonishments to `` wind in the neck '' and domestic trends towards neutralism - `` bigger switzerland '' , you know ) and the helplessness of the political body if faced by confrontational behavior can be found there . 
  if your foreign and security policy decisions are being formed and preformulated in washington and/or brussels ( and your own politicians are left to sell it to the public at home ) it should be of no surprise that the basic ability to `` play hardball '' in international circles is lost because you never have to think about it ( unless it concerns money , but we all know that there is no friendship where money is concerned ) . 
  it 's visible in pretty much any of the current crisis patterns : how merkel is being ( very publicly ) fleeced by erdogan in the refugee issue , how german politicians are waffling and meandering all about the place when it comes to defense policy issues ( because they fear taking a stand and having to suffer eventual consequences in the domestic arena ) , even in the lack of respect some refugees have for the german state and its police ( precisely because the latter ca n't play `` hardball '' ) ... germany has become a country with such an * overwhelming * culture of consensus , both between the state and the people and within the political body , that we - as a society - ca n't deal with people who blatantly , willingly and unscrupulously work against or outside this ideal of consensus . 
  this is why our politicians look so horrendously stupid when dealing with people like putin . 
  that , and the tiny fact that russia has a serious nuclear arsenal and germany has none . 
  no matter what we could n't negotiate from a position of power . 
  that also is a legacy of `` neue ostpolitik '' - we constantly try to keep any lighters or matches away from the fuse . 
   ... just fucking vote for politicians who will spend actual money on german defense ... and here is the fundamental problem : the only ones who would `` spend actual money on german defense '' are the the fringe right-wingers , the neo-nazis , and of course those would spend for all the wrong reasons . 
  the mainstream politicians come from a system that provides very strong ( and i mean ** very strong ** ) disincentives to touch security and defense issues even with a ten-meter-pole . 
  you want to know how bad it is ? 
  here is a direct quote , from an mp who was voted into the bundestag for the first time in 2013 :  if you * do n't * want a career in german politicis then deal with security and defense . 
  if an mp , a person who has been voted into a position of surpreme responsibility , makes such a statement what does that say about the political establishment and the system ? 
   if estonia was to be attacked , you 're obligated to show up to their defense . 
  the baltics are the last place where `` strategic air transport '' makes sense , to be frank . 
  not with the multitude of s-300 / 400 and soon-to-be s-500 air defense systems aplenty in the northwestern russian oblasts and especially within kaliningrad oblast . 
  given the emphasis you placed on that topic i had thought you were talking about military interventions in africa or the middle east . 
  those are n't exactly accepted , much less supported by germans . 
   it 's almost exclusively us personnel ( currently got 3 friends at the command ) , with a lot of help from the dutch . 
  germany helps , but they do less than the dutch do . 
  it 's a multinational nato operation and multiple nations paid for the aircraft and provide crews . 
  of course the us is the largest provider , you are by far the largest , wealthiest and most populated nato country . 
  i was merely pointing out that germany does have access to this capability by participating in this unit . 
  and that provides enough awacs capabilities for our current needs , we do n't really need independent capabilities in this sector as we simply would n't conduct independent ( unilateral ) military operations in which they might be needed . 
   why is why at this point , they do n't even count . 
  sead fighters need constant updates , not really to weapon loadouts , but the electronics . 
  aa and vulnerabilities constantly change . 
  a decade old software , is absolutely useless and essentially does n't even serve a purpose . 
  +1  that , is 100 % political incompetence . 
  there 's literally zero excuse , to have a 25b euro a year military budget , in one of the wealthiest nations on earth , and your fucking armed forces have to beg a foreign nation to come back , just so they can get free training . 
  none . 
  none what so ever . 
  you know what the problem is ? 
  with the downfall of the soviet union and the breakup of warsaw pact the * raison d'etre * , the entire reason why the bundeswehr had been founded in the first place , went away ... and along with it any reason to spend +2 % of gdp on defense ( as it had been customary prior to 1989 ) . 
  not to mention that reunification ranked far higher on the priority scale than military spending ( considering that after 25 years and +2 trillion euros of transfers to the eastern federal states there is still a sizeable gap in economic potential between east and west ) . 
  it was sensible to downscale both the military and the expenditures , even though neither downscaling was accompanied by sensible planning ... now , to * proud manta * and the situation of the german navy . 
  to make a long story short : the german navy has a ** serious ** manpower problem , it does n't have enough people to crew all the available ships in the first place ( for example for the six submarines we have 3 crews at best ) and it does n't get enough applications to join , either . 
  to make matters worse - and ** this ** is political incompetence - we have a defense minister ( and a chancellor ) who are quick to send ships into ops without checking whether the navy can actually provide one . 
  for example the various deployments ( horn of africa , lebanon , refugee rescue in the med , nato exercises etc ) have cut into the number of ships so much , that the navy ca n't even create a customary training group this year . 
  for example to escort the * charles de gaulle * von der leyen offered a frigate as escort , clearly thinking of a type f124 sachsen-class air defense frigate , but had to send an old f122 class frigate because all three f124-class ships were unavailable ( one in training , one deployed , one in dock ) . 
   germans should be fucking ashamed of that , but instead , it 's a badge of pride , because a competent military means you 're going to take over the world . 
  to make something very clear : the germans ( the ordinary ones ) never wanted to even have a military in the first place after 1945 . 
  the bundeswehr was formed against broad and considerable public protest and even then the bundeswehr was never more than a tolerated army . 
  but i have to disagree with one thing : germans do n't want a large military because of the nazi associations ( that was true for the survivors of the war and the generation afterwards ) , but rather because the predominant anti-military mindset is the * default * germans grow up with and have grown up with for decades . 
  it 's never been different in living memory and people do n't perceive any advantage in changing it . 
  it 's kinda similar to the `` weapons culture '' of the us ... the country is no longer the hostile wilderness riddled with beasts of prey and potentially hostile natives which made weapons ownership mandatory in the early days of colonization . 
  and yet there 's no society-wide move away from the 2nd amendment ... because it would change one pillar of the society in which us citizens grow up . 
  but it was never codified as binding criteria , all such attempts were fended off . 
  it 's no more than an `` aspiration '' , a very loose thing . 
  if i may dissect your post a bit ...  4 strategic transport aircraft for a 170,000 + man force is pathetic . 
  that 's enough to get maybe 1000 troops somewhere and constantly supplied . 
  what 's the rest of the 58,000 german army going to do ? 
  practice shooting their brooms ? 
  the german society ** never ** bought into the logic of deploying military force abroad . 
  ** never ** !, 
  the society has never accepted the concept of `` interventions '' anywhere and politically both the kosovo and the afghanistan mission had to be forced through parliament via tactics that amounted to political blackmail ( fischer threatened to walk out of the greens over kosovo , which would have led to the collapse of the brand-new red-green coalition in 1999 - schr\u00f6der connected the afghanistan deployment to a vote of confidence because a large slice of his own party refused to sanction the plan and so he forced them into compliance ) . 
  which is why germans per se see no need for `` strategic air transport '' , most of us would be quite happy to keep the bundeswehr in its barracks ( or on the training grounds at home ) . 
  we have a fundamentally * defensive * view of our military , it 's for defense , not for military adventures in countries far away . 
  that is the reality that foreign nations simply have not recognized yet or refuse to realize . 
   zero awacs to give those typhoons a mobile , long range radar platform to help it protect hundreds of square miles at any given time . 
  germany is heavily invested in the nato e-3 squadron in kaltenkirchen . 
  given the taboo of offensive military operations this satisfies our needs for such airborne c2 . 
  additionally our constitution prohibits `` preparation for and conduct of wars of aggression '' and the 1994 ruling of the constitutional court only allowed participation in security alliances ... it did ** not ** annul the prohibition of any offensive ( strategic ) military operations . 
  so even if there was the political will to conduct such operations we could not do any of this unilaterally , we 'd need a change of constitution and the chances of this are virtually zero . 
   zero sead fighters to take out an enemy 's air defense network so forces can push forward . 
  actually the luftwaffe operates 35 tornado ecr which are electronic combat and especially sead types ( these took part over kosovo in their sead role ) . 
  what needs to be said , however , is that they have n't seen much of an update over the past decade and especially the harm armament gets a bit long in the tooth . 
   it reeks of incompetence at the hands of politicians who think they know what the military needs better than the military itself . 
  it actually reeks of a country which does n't face ( = perceive ) a direct military threat while at the same time has considerable negative associations to all things military .
