  i ( naturally ) was n't but it 's easy to deduct varoufakis tactics via the grandstanding he displayed in the international media . 
  and that was bad enough . 
  the `` technical problem '' is that such a basing agreement is not a purely bilateral thing . 
  if , theoretically , such an agreement leads to higher tensions and maybe ( via coincidence and a bootload of bad luck ) it comes to an exchange of fire between baltic or us forces and russian forces what would the effect on nato be ? 
  looking back at the pew poll last year it 's clear that some governments may not only be tempted to decry such an incident as `` provoked '' by the deployment of permanent forces to the region but some may actually be forced by a hostile domestic constituency to reject the invocation of article 5 . 
  at that point nato is dead ... and along with it the entire trans-atlantic political arrangements . 
  and the winner in this ? 
  putin . 
  because he could now safely withdraw a step because he has achieved his prime goals : destruction of nato , probably also the destruction of the eu , a divided europe and no geopolitical competition on this flank . 
  they do , again technically speaking . 
  you assume the automatic result of a stronger us presence ( which , by the way , will still remain rather limited ) is a russia that 's being detered . 
  the problem with this attitude is that you assume putin is entirely rational ... now let 's fast forward a few years and assume the oil price has not recovered , russia 's economy is even further down the drain and domestic pressure is rising . 
  it 's one of those `` something has to give '' moments ... 
  when faced with a question of either domestic revolution , personal loss of power and status and perhaps even incarceration or death ( in russia you never know ) is it really too much to think that he may make an attempt to deflect domestic anger at some foreign actors ( the us presence in the baltics in this case ) ? 
  or , even worse , we do n't know what comes after putin . 
  given his reliance on theocratic , authoritarian and neo-nationalistic forces we may see the rise of something far more unpleasant than putin ... and then what ? 
  as i said it 's all theoretical and technical at the moment . 
  if i am allowed to speak frankly : germans have been hammered with admonishments to `` wind in our necks '' , keep our heads down and mind our own business and not even dare to think about `` projection '' for decades after the war by an international community that was understandably wary of germany due to past transgressions . 
  that has had an effect on public mindsets - and that should not surprise anyone - and the result is this `` not my business '' attitude . 
  the problem with varoufakis was his utter reliance on his game-theory background in political negotiations . 
  he projected the picture of a never-say-death type of gambler , one who was n't prepared for compromises ( if the eu works on one thing then it 's compromise ) and who was trying to bluff anyone else into an outcome that had no political majorities in any of the other countries . 
  varoufakis grossly misjudged the amount of influence he had and eventually turned everyone against him by his negotiation style . 
   why would germans even have anything to say when it 's e. europe and usa matter . 
  not to disagree with this ( pls ignore my country flair on this one - i am undecided either way ) but then - technically - you ca n't lean on nato when such political concepts were n't agreed upon by all nato members . 
  theoretically if such a strictly bilateral agreement between a baltic state and the us existed and it came to a military confrontation with russia over this other nato members ( like germany ) would either be forced to commit to article 5 of the treaty without having had a say in political decisions leading up to its invocation or they would be tempted to block the invocation of article 5 in the face of an angry domestic public that wants nothing to do with a military confrontation they rejected in the first place . 
  that is a problem and one that could break nato . 
  but it 's all grey theory , anyway . 
  [ tongue-in-cheek ] well , there the money at least serves a noticeable purpose ( housing , services , construction etc ) . 
  it helps our local economies a bit ... ca n't say that about defense spending ( which , at this point , is a very leaky barrel anyway ) . 
  [ / tongue-in-cheek ], 
  talking a bit ot ( not regarding to this specific political decision ) : for the most part people here in germany are n't * putinversteher * . 
  sure , there are a good number of those , too , but most of these are right - or left-wing fringe loonies , anyway ( and some are spd members who ca n't exist out of a very specific mental environment , either ) . 
  most simply see no reason to get into a confrontation with russia over anything east of the current eu borders . 
  v-man put himself into the chamber pot . 
  kinda easy to be shat on when you 've maneuvered yourself into that place in the first place . 
  there 's no `` treaty comnmitment '' but a very lax `` aspiration to '' . 
  no point in rhetorically trying to turn a soft cushion into a block of concrete . 
  besides : in germany 's case that would be a whopping 25 billion euros more - every goddamned year . 
  unrealistic is n't half of it . 
  without descending into splitting hairs ( too much ) i 'd say it 's `` theoretically conceivable '' but not `` possible '' . 
  nobody in europe is anywhere near that level of `` solidarity '' . 
  which is why it 's impossible in the first place . 
  try to bring this on and you will see falling governments in the `` net payer '' states and a change to anti- $ governments faster than you could say `` bloody hell !, 
   american withdrawal would result in a power vacuum , and within 5 years or less there 'd be an arms race as france germany and uk all see who could re arm and re equip their empires the fastest . 
  i really urge you to drop the history books and take a long hard look at modern germany . 
  or even better : come over here and live here for a while . 
  that would really show you how nonsensical that comment above really is and how little in common your view has with the general socio-political culture of modern germany . 
  100-rubber-point-question : who has been hounding germany to increase defense spending and military activities for the past 25 years ? 
  yep - the us ( and france ) . 
  that 's a given . 
  the export models ( even those manufactured in european states ) never had most of the bells and whistles of the soviet models . 
  but it 's still a relatively low-cost venture ( it takes only small parts of the t-72b2 project and does n't use the best available products ) . 
  it 's clearly a gap filler until the armata arrives in numbers , but given the economic troubles russia already has ( which are but a dim shadow of what will surely come should the oil price stay this low ) i 'd not put any money on seeing that tank in numbers anytime soon . 
  you really fail to appreciate the ** fundamentally defensive mindset ** post-war germany ( and therefor today 's germany ) has adopted . 
  when formed the bundeswehr was set up in a way that precluded any capability to wage `` strategic offensive warfare '' by constitutional , institutional , political and physical means . 
  meaning it was never equipped with the long-range-long-term logistical setup needed to send forces into other states and keep them there on a war footing for a longer time nor did it ever get any truly strategic weapon systems . 
  this has greatly influenced the mindset of the german society and politicians ( apart from the massiv devaluation and delegitimization of all things military after the end of ww2 ) - as dambrit said military power projection is a politically and socially toxic thing and nobody dares to touch it with a ten-meter-pike . 
  you should really look deeply into the history of the bundeswehr and how domestic and foreign influences kept the bundeswehr * a ) totally reliant on strategic guidance by nato ( it has , to this day , no real general staff but a small `` mission control command '' which leads ops on foreign soil - and it has no independent notion of strategymaking at all ) * b ) incapable of fighting a strategically offensive war * c ) tightly integrated into nato structures ( to the point that 90 % of all west german mechanized forces were not under german but nato command ) heck , when west germany was supposed to join nato a nato representative had to stage a political horseplay in the bundestag , solemnly avowing a skittish german society that nato membership would be defensive only and would not require german forces abroad . 
  even the question of war or peace were specifically defined and procedures outlined in great detail . 
  there were only three states : a state of peace ( normal ) , a state of tension and finally a state of defense . 
  all procedures ( and alternatives ) were outlined ingreat detail and involved a 2/3 majority of the bundestag ( unless , of course , the bundestag had ceased to exist in a soviet surprise attack ) . 
  all of that has influenced the mindset germans grow up with . 
  for us the military is defensive , end of discussion . 
  notions of `` power projection '' do n't have any following over here , as former federal president k\u00f6hler had to find out when he spoke of such notions and did n't get any support even from his own party ( he resigned in a huff ) . 
  like i said before : you are entitled to your feeling of responsibility , but i do n't share that view as it goes along with a `` sense of mission '' , something i simply ca n't and wo n't subscribe to . 
  not much ( apart from missing the fundamentally defensive outlook the german population has where the military is concerned ) . 
  ihidemei has merely missed the load of articles on the state of the bundeswehr ** and ** he mistranslates economical power into military power ( while ignoring the historical reasons for not being particularly fond of all things military germany has ) . 
  you missed my point : we ca n't * stabilize * situations if the people there have no intention of going to peace in the first place . 
  this is nowhere more obvious than in libya , where the first thing the libyans after ghaddafi 's death was to form militias fighting each other for the loot and ultimately two competing `` governments '' . 
  interventionism is based on the faulty premise that in any conflict the common people are unwilling hostages and it would only take the removal of the warring factions to see peace return . 
  in reality such interventions have merely shifted the reasons for bloodshed from good old-fashioned power-mongering to settling scores between tribal , religious or ethnic groups that may be several centuries old . 
  the west has , essentially , enabled some populations to return to the age-old traditions of atrocity-and-counter-atrocity * ad infinitum * , something that the arabic and north african region is riddled with like a loaf of cheese full of maggots . 
  and that is supposed to be an achievement ? 
  well , you are of course entitled to your `` feeling of responsibility '' but i am not interested in playing world police . 
  besides ... yes , i am a hardcore cynic . 
  i see what has happened in afghanistan , in iraq , in libya and in what is going on in mali . 
  all those theorists yammering about `` humanitarian interventions '' or `` responsibility to protect '' should look at the balance sheet and realize how little has been accomplished in any of these cases . 
  warning . 
  hardcore cynism ahead : besides i believe people will always find reasons to have a go at each others throats . 
  back in the 17th century it was europe which had been steeped in religious fanatism and balance of power brinkmanship , currently it 's the islamic world . 
  especially libya shows that the internal power struggle between modernism and archaic religious-tribalistic structures is something us westeners ca n't and should not try to meddle in . 
  i am actually convinced that the islamic world needs the realization that fighting over this does no good , but just like europe at the end of the 30-years-war it will take a huge number of dead to drive that message home . 
   what 's the point of a military in this age of mobile warfare that ca n't deploy outside its borders ? 
  it 's useless . 
  i 'm with bristlerider on this one : what is the point of all those military interventions that do nothing but to fuck up the situation even more , cost a bootload of money and in the end we get streams of refugees/migrants anyway ? 
  to adhere to some `` international relations theory '' ? 
  oh please ... 
  sorry , but to me socialism and communism are purely theoretical and utopian concepts , that may work in the vacuum of pure theory but will almost immediately falter in the face of reality , human ambitions , human faults of character and a bunch of other things . 
  i can , of course , only speak for myself , but having grown up in east germany i can at least claim to have had a personal `` sample '' of how `` egalitarian '' such a `` socialist society '' was and how reality `` adjusted '' the frilly ideals of the original concept . 
  for me the idea of communism ( imo * das kapital * and communist manifest are inseparable and must be seen together ) is based on a starry eyed view of man , because - as the history of socialist and communist movements shows - there will always be people striving for leadership positions , personal power and the trappings of it while only paying lip service to the egalitarian and utopian aspects of the ideology . 
  uhm , no ... 
  i regard '' * das kapital * '' as nonsense ( as its main message and idea runs counter to man 's instinctual prioritization of oneself ) and '' '' * mein kampf * '' as utter trash because it 's little more than the paranoid rantings of a failed art student trying to assign blame . 
  there are certain books you do n't need to read to know that they 're either total nonsense or utter trash . 
  * das kapital * is among them ( along with * mein kampf * ) . 
  gladly . 
  like marx and engels , who both built their `` communist ideology '' on the back of a relatively high income ( back in their days , engels was even a successful entepreneur and factory owner ) varoufakis is the epitome of a salon socialist , droning on about `` socialist ideals '' from the safety of his own armchair while leading an upper middle class life with plenty of financial safety for himself . 
  the people who preach communist or socialist theories loudest are usually those who never were part of the `` working class '' to begin with nor do they have any idea about the lives of these people . 
  and v-man is a pretty nasty example of this disconnected `` head in the clouds '' theorizing . 
  so v-man 1.1 = marx 2.0 ? 
  thanks , i 'll gladly pass ...
