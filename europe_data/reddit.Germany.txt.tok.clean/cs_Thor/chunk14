  still russia should not lose a single syllable about rule of law when itself is not only oppressing any opposition within the country but also sends death squads after dissidents in foreign countries ( litvinenko , anyone ? 
  we have no rolands anymore !, 
  phased years ago !, 
  air defense is now limited to the regiment with patriots plus a handful of smaller stuff based on wiesel/ozelot . 
  russia ... rule of law ... [ dissolves into hysterical laughter ], 
  sorry to say this , but this is a typically `` german '' view which does n't correspond with the political reality in france ( again ) . 
  france is a presidential democracy where the executive has the right to send military out without consulting the parliament in advance . 
  the french would never agree to see their deployment authority castrated by such a setup . 
  if anything it 's been germany who has been under fire from washington , paris and london for having a * parlamentsvorbehalt * in the first place ... again - our political cultures and interests are far too diverse and in parts incompatible . 
  as such a `` european army '' is going to remain a fata morgana . 
  the rolands were also mounted on a marder chassis for mobile army air defense , but the entire branch `` army air defense '' has been phased out . 
  pointless . 
  europe is nowhere near that point . 
  france would fight tooth and nail against a defensive setup because they want european resources to underpin their interests in africa , the east would fight tooth and nail against a setup that is n't geared towards deterring russia ( germany will balk at either ) and everybody would be at each others throat about who pays what . 
  no , roland and gepard have all been phased out . 
  there is currently no army air defense ( the patriot batteries belong to the luftwaffe ) even though there have been calls to rebuild this capability . 
  it 's neither `` called for in the treaty '' nor is it mandatory . 
  it 's a wishy-washy number , arbitrary as it gets . 
  it 's a surrogate debate that avoids the truly challenging one : what exactly is nato for ? 
  some members ( baltics , poland , romania ) are pointing at russia and territorial defense , others ( us , uk , france ) see it more like a toolbox for expeditionary warfare and the rest ( germany among them ) does n't see either way as particularly appealing . 
  this trifold division is the true problem and as it is a clash not only of interests but of socio-political cultures it is a really tough nut to crack . 
  it 's not clear because it has n't been specified . 
  but judging by current budgetary planning it would mean an increase of about 3 to 4 billion over the current plans . 
  i blame a lack of coffee , 
   i thought europe and the west just shrugging their shoulders and saying `` not our problem , whatever '' was something that ended in the balkans and breakup of yugoslavia . 
  oh dear , you 've taken the political bait hook , line and sinker ... again , have n't you ? 
  that may be the political blabla , but in general people do n't run around looking at other parts of the world for problems they could potentially solve . 
  fact is most people are simply occupied with their personal realities ** and ** another fact is that most countries simply do n't have any notion of a `` missionary spirit '' as the one that often seems to drive us foreign policy decisions . 
  most europeans simply do n't subscribe to any national or `` continental '' exceptionalism and most states never had a dominant globalist political culture that could underpin notions of looking out for `` people in a land far away of whom we know nothing '' . 
  was n't croatia no 29 ? 
  or did i mix up things here ? 
  europe is but a geographical location , a continent and that 's about it . 
  the eu is a club of 29 member states . 
  there is neither a `` european people '' nor any `` european identity '' or any such tosh . 
   is ukraine worthy of no western and european solidarity solely because it is n't a paper signatory ? 
  quite frankly ... the amount of `` solidarity '' i can be asked to spare is very dependent on what is asked . 
  to give consent to german officials providing assistance to the ukrainian authorities in tackling their systemic problems ( nepotism , corruption , cronyism , oligarchism etc ) and economic aid is okay , but do n't even think about asking me to consent to potentially risking a thermo-nuclear war over something as etheric as `` solidarity '' or `` values '' . 
  that wo n't fly at all . 
   is that all the eu is ? 
  people trying to turn the eu into something more than a club of countries cooperating for economical reasons is precisely the reason why the eu is struggling so much at the moment . 
  which , in turn , should make it obvious that enough people in the member states do n't particularly see the reason for turning it into more in the first place . 
   is that all it means to be a european ? 
  geographical location ... yes , that is all . 
  some may be trying to build cloud castles of `` common dreams '' or such tosh but in the end eu membership is either a boon ( for economical reasons ) or it 's seen as a drag on national resources . 
  ask the brits ... 
   the left is the only party that can be taken seriously in terms of fighting for social justice . 
  the left can only be taken serious if you are hellbent on driving germany against a concrete wall with 200 km/h . 
  their ideological blinkers prevent this anti-party - which , imo , only works as long as they can yammer , whine and b * tch against things but woe betide them if they ever get real responsibilities ( look closely how `` left '' their programs in the federal states where they 're part of the governments are ) - prevent them from realizing the time of the ancient fallibe concepts of marx and engels have been cast into the dustbin of history . 
  die linke lives on being an opposition party . 
  nothing else . 
  most of those could n't even properly spell antiimperialism . 
  trust me , i have had to deal with more of them during my vocational training in berlin than i ever wanted to . 
  well , tell that to the fdp . 
  they actually dropped out because they really f *** ed up and the voter punished them . 
  actually i am very much in favor of the 5 % hurdle as it keeps the rabble out and provides the mere chance of having a working parliament . 
  i 've been voting for `` freie w\u00e4hler '' since 2005 now . 
  this way i can support a centrist but conservative group that is n't the cdu even though they never manage to get into parliaments . 
  but at least i can say i did not vote for the sorry rest . 
  ah really ? 
  have n't read the verbal sh * t that hocke guy has been spreading ? 
  this man has a leading position within the party and i know the utterings of gauland and his pseudo-conservative ( read : national-chauvinist ) cabal . 
  i do n't need to see the label `` proto-nazi '' to recognize them from a mile away . 
  there 's a bit of a trench fight between the wings of `` die linke '' - part of the old pds ( the * realistic wing * ) is of course on the left side of the spectrum , but not with a frothing-at-the-mouth or head in the clouds attitude . 
  but the extreme left wing , spearheaded by the current co-leader of the party sarah wagenknecht ( who can safely be called a neo-stalinist ) , is formed not only by wagenknecht 's `` communist platform '' but mostly by social-romantic nutjobs of the former `` wasg '' ( a splinter group which broke off from the spd after schr\u00f6der 's agenda 2010 reforms ) . 
  this wing is basically made up by hardcore-fundamentalist ideologes and `` salon socialists '' , you know those nutters droning on about left-wing political theories and the `` oppression of the masses '' , mirages of world revolutions and such tosh in their safe armchairs while eating expensive meals and drinking expensive wines . 
  the west german left spectrum always produced idiots en masse ( some went to great lengths like those who formed the red army faction terror group in the 1970s ) . 
  `` die linke '' functions as the most visible `` roof '' over this mass of different groupings . 
  the left spectrum in post-war west germany has always had a very strong anti-military streak and after the fall of the wall the pds ( successor to the east-german sed and predecessor to today 's `` die linke '' ) adopted this fundamental anti-militarism as well . 
  it 's a peculiar thing for germany that some parts of the ultra-left spectrum carry to an extreme of hating virtually everything german ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-germans_ ( political_current ) ) , but in general all left and ultra-left parties in germany share this fundamental rejection of all things military . 
  the csu was and is but a specifically bavarian appendix to the cdu and usually makes headlines with beerhall-type rhetoric blunders . 
  i usually file their utterings under `` the mouse that wanted to roar '' . 
  the afd under lucke was not formed , yet , for me to get a full picture . 
  they had the whiff of a one-trick-pony , but before they could flesh out their own core they allowed the right to infiltrate and take them over . 
  welcome to the world of political correct straightjackets in germany . 
  anything right of cdu/csu gets a trainload of political undies in a twist . 
  remember nothing must damage the holy `` consensus '' ... and i say that as someone who had hopes for the afd but after their takeover by right-wing populists and closet nazis i lost any kind of interest in them . 
  for me they have become just as despicable as pegida with their dumb slogans . 
  yes , well , but as we know from darwin 's evolutionary theories people ( or in this case a people ) are also shaped by their environment . 
  an institutional setup is part of a nation 's framework which does have an influence on public attitudes short-term , medium-term and especially long-term . 
  i would not put too much emphasis on foreign powers in the development of this attitude . 
  true , all the allied victors of ww2 and germany 's neighbors wanted a decidedly unmilitary and inward-looking germany , but this meshed with german domestic attitudes after the war . 
  remember there was a broad societal opposition to the forming of the bundeswehr , the `` ohne mich '' ( count me out ) movement , which did n't just see the usual suspects of social-democratic or socialist people opposing this step , but a lot of downright conservative people , among them many survivors of ww2 ( some highly decorated veterans ) were also against rearmament - and not just because that further cemented the german division . 
  today this disregard and disinterest in military affairs , once the instinctive reaction of often traumatized and tired survivors , has become a cultural default and the reality germans today grow up with . 
  this is what defines attitudes , a reality we see and experience every day and what has been as long as we and our parents can think back , and not some psychological `` trauma '' deriving from ww2 . 
  that is , in my opinion , utter tosh . 
  the political aspect you alluded to is central imo . 
  with the collapse of the wall and the warsaw pact the single reason for the bundeswehr to exist ( literally - all documents prior to 1989 justified a west german military with strict self-defense ) vanished and no political concept has emerged so far . 
  as such the bundeswehr exists in a political and strategic vacuum because it drifts between domestic indifference and foreign expectations and demands which the german political body can not and does not want to fill . 
  the systemic issues come from a lack of political guidance , a lack of responsibility within the ministerial bureaucracy , a culture of subservience within the higher echelons of the bundeswehr and a near total disinterest of the german society in military affairs . 
  simply put the new equipment procured post 1990 and the international deployments ( regardless how sensible or useful they were/are ) were never based on a sound and sufficient financial fundament as post 1990 defense spending was pretty much at the bottom of political and societal priorities . 
  as such big ticket purchases such as the eurofighter , the nh 90 fiasco , the a400m fiasco etc not only hurt the bundeswehr by being far above budget and far too late but effectively ate into the basic substance of the military and eroded any kind of sustainability . 
  on top of this the recent `` transformation '' was the most glaring and most drastic example of `` design to cost '' , a military that was supposed to be the jack of all trades ** and ** the master of all while at the same time it should n't cost anything , either . 
  structures that during the cold war were geared towards high availability of material and a decent reserve capability were dismantled in favor of `` modern economic structures '' that were simple cost-cutting exercises but hurt material availability and readiness . 
  the luftwaffe , with its high-cost platforms , is just the most visible aspect of this very fundamental `` malnutrition '' . 
  nothing of this can be changed quickly . 
  it would need political will to change course dramatically but the merkel government has again and again revealed its basic disinterest and disregard for security and defense issues and so i doubt there 'll be anything of the sort anytime soon . 
   pedigda : `` if people were sane , they would grab their pitchforks and and attack treasonous elites in parliament , the church and the courthouses . '', 
  ... and you sorry lot would end up being stuck on the next pitchfork over . 
  actually the federal state of bavaria ( as the state where said `` bohemian corporal '' was registered as `` in residence '' last ) accquired the copyright after said person 's death and sat on it for the 70 years this copyright lasts . 
  i apologize for not having been clear .
