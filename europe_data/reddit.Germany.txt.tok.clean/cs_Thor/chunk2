  deterrence is usually reliant on sane opponents , right now i am wondering how sane russia really is at this time . 
   if the germans and the french talked less and did more than maybe the e. europeans would have greater trust . 
  anything related to the military is the ** very last thing to try ** , according to post-war german political culture . 
  are you seriously surprised that germans are n't gung-ho after seven decades of mistrust , admonishments and a cold war in which a military conflict would have been the end of germany as a whole ? 
  german politicians come from a party system that thoroughly believes that its job is to keep a lid on the `` dangerous beast '' that any military inherently is . 
  they also come from a society that has no use for military power beyond strict self-defense ( and where dealing with defense issues does n't win them anything ) . 
  are you seriously surprised that there 's no enthusiasm to go down this route again ? 
  i agree that invoking historical events is n't helping in this case . 
  the perception ( on my part ) is that various european states are kinda quick to throw out references to the nazi past in attempts to shame germany into backing their pov on specific issues ( as could be seen in greece and now partially in poland ) . 
  but anyway ... merkel is merkel on that issue and she 's always kept close to public opinion in germany . 
  there is neither the will nor the political culture to confront russia . 
  it contradicts our domestic political culture ( which is very consensus oriented , especially since reunification ) and all of the instincts that are ingrained in post-war germans ... our political culture treats the military as a potential danger and the role of politics is to tame and restrain the military , not use it as a tool . 
  hence the intensive focus on de-escalation . 
   also what references to ribbentrop-molotov ? 
  * cough *  merkel was n't bent on appeasing putin at the expense of russia 's neighbors others have labeled this a re-play of molotov-ribbentrop . 
   maybe if german army would be in a better state and merkel was n't bent on appeasing putin at the expense of russia 's neighbors ... 
  if germany had a capable army pis would be the first to cry wolf and resurrect the historical image of oppressive/conquering germany or whatever self-serving propaganda image they could dig out . 
  and the constant references to molotov-ribentrop do n't help your cause , either . 
  instead it makes you look paranoid and hypocritical . 
  i was pretty supportive of permanent bases in poland , but given some rhetorics coming out of poland these days i 'm beginning to rethink my stance out of spite . 
  the `` true '' denazification in west germany only began with the 1968 student revolt . 
  as its protagonists were very left-wing they also stood for a certain interpretation of history and ideas about the future . 
  so , despite their contribution of ending the culture of silence on the nazi past they also managed to discredit the majority of germany 's military history as because of their ideology they saw that as logical precursors to the ns dictatorship and therefor not worthy of being remembered or even revered . 
  and this is especially true for the entirety of the brandenburg-prussian history which the left still sees as the breeding ground out of which nazism ultimately grew . 
  that the nazis negated and perverted a bootload of prussian values and traditions and that the sed in the gdr relied heavily on pseudo-prussianism for its own army was and is conveniently ignored . 
  the ultimate shape of this rejection of german history is a small political movement called `` anti-germans '' ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-germans_ ( political_current ) ) which rejects any kind of german authority , identity and statehood and mixes this outlook with radically left-wing ideology . 
  yeah , us krauts are good in producing total nutjobs . 
  yeah , but the soviets kept this up for a lot longer and essentially set up structures and contracts so that the gdr had to transfer hard currency right up until 1989 ( i.e. 
  for oil etc ) . 
  there 's a funny story about a reconstructed heavy industry facility from the late 1950s in the region i 'm from . 
  the sed had spent considerable amounts of cash to purchase brand new equipment of a steel mill and was already * ooohing * and * aaaahing * about how modern this is in local press . 
  once everything was set up they invited a soviet delegation to `` show off '' ... and two days later a letter from moscow arrived demanding the dismantling of the steel mill in order to have it shipped to the ussr as `` war reparations '' . 
  the sed was horrified and utterly embarrassed and all talk of it in the media ceased immediately . 
  but of course people found out about it and the party satrapies were the target of nasty jokes for quite some time . 
  it does take time , nobody denies that , but essentially the situation developed from `` a drop in the ocean '' to `` absolutely insufficient '' in many western cities and communities . 
  part of the reason is the unwillingness of large parts of the cdu and most of the csu to go beyond their ultra-conservative ( ancient ) ideas about family life and child rearing , which can be seen in this `` herdpr\u00e4mie '' embarrassment and the csu 's reaction . 
  imo these parties are too focused on financial transactions and a no longer tolerable dislike of public childcare institutions because ... 
  the spd and the greens prefer it ? 
  because the gdr had a much larger and encompassing system ? 
  because of hidden `` the women must stay home and raise the kids '' mentality ? 
  money is n't everything ... and in this case it 's not exactly helpful . 
  but as long as getting a kindergarten place is almost impossible in many western federal states or - equally problematic - the facility closes as 2 p.m. it 's very difficult to bring family and job in line . 
  my own brother and sister-in-law to-be just moved back from the west into my east german home village because getting a kindergarten place for my niece was impossible or downright prohibitive . 
  back home my brother earns a lot less , but at least they have a kindergarten place for my niece ( although that wo n't be an issue until next year at the earliest ) and they have two sets of grandparents nearby to play babysitter  but as long as the csu and parts of the cdu are stuck in the stuffy 1950s and its ancient moral and role perception we 're going to have a split republic when it comes to kids : the east has enough kindergarten places but little in the form of jobs , the west has plenty jobs but ca n't offer daycare for the kids so that young people often have serious issues with caring for their child . 
  that often leads to them abandoning plans of having more than one ( i have two colleagues who went this route ) . 
  unfortunately french authorities have proven time and time again that they operate in the security & defense area according to the old maxime `` my way on the highway or no way at all '' . 
  look at libya ... how they wanted to keep nato out of the operation until they realized that they had no pull to keep the other nations on board , look at how bit by bit eads/airbus was transfered ( systematically ) to french soil and how french or french-appointed officials took over more and more key positions , how france first engaged in the eurofighter consortium , extracted valuable information and then left in a huff when other nations refused to hand france and dassault the project on a silver platter . 
  the list can go on for quite a while ... an a lot of germans predict the same fate for the recent nexter - kmw merger . 
  france will extract valuable knowhow from kmw and then move more and more assets into the nexter part - simply because french authorities are wily and hard-nosed and are defending not only their national interests but also their national corporations against any outside influence . 
  and german politicians are naively and starry-eyedly running into their doom in their pipe dreams and their head-in-the-clouds european bullshyte . 
  and then they lament the loss of jobs and knowhow in germany . 
  pah ... as if merkel would budge on this just to please cameron . 
  the article reads like someone grasping for straws 'cause he sees his case sink . 
  free movement of people inside the eu will not be up for negotiation , mark my words . 
  ok , let me disentangle this a bit . 
  libya had been an italian colony before being released into independence in 1951 . 
  sarkozy 's position and `` zeal '' for the libyan uprising has its roots in his support for the tunisian dictator ben ali before and during the initial protests in tunisia . 
  when ben ali left the country the french political establishment was caught on the wrong foot , one article refering to sarkozy himself being `` on the wrong side of history '' . 
  with presidential elections on the horizont for 2012 sarkozy 's position in the pre-electoral race had been damaged and he was keen to undo the damage . 
  when the situation in libya escalated into civil war it was the french philosopher bernhard-henri levy who visited the rebel groups and who connected them directly with president sarkozy . 
  what exactly his role was remains unclear but in any case the french government recognized the libyan revolutionary council as legitimate government of libya before anyone else and even before consulting his eu partners . 
  this was the kickstarter for what was to become un resolution 1973 . 
  i think it 's fair to say that sarkozy was motivated to openly support the libyan rebels primarily because his his previous foul-up over the tunisian dictator ben ali and his damaged domestic standing before the upcoming presidential election , that he was intent on `` being on the right side of history this time '' . 
  in his zeal to show `` international leadership '' he ran roughshod over diplomatic procedures and exasperated a number of states , not just germany or poland but also and especially turkey ( who did n't take kindly to reports that he had praised his foreign minister for his `` crusade to mobilize the africans and arabs '' for his plans ) . 
  the rest is history . 
  soviet version : `` comrade chairman stalin simply ** ca n't ** know this ! '', 
  nazi version : `` if only the f\u00fchrer knew this ... '', 
  you 're still missing the point . 
  france - as the leader of the `` european defense project '' ( so to speak ) - will never tolerate a merely defensive policy nor will they tolerate any way of having their `` sovereign autonomy '' on both foreign policy and military decisions infringed by eu decisions . 
  their political establishment has always wanted to have european resources underpin french foreign policy interests and they also wanted to mold `` europe puissance '' into their vision of how the community should be structured and how it should behave . 
  that is why they started the `` european security and defense policy '' back in 1999 with britain , they wanted to turn the eu into a resource provider for military interventions and into a collection of states who see such things `` the proper french way '' . 
  the brits only went along because they thought such an endeavor would strengthen the european pillar of nato but recoiled when they realized the `` gaullist '' aspect of french ambitions . 
  the idea of a `` simple '' defensive pact is nice but it clashes with the ambitions of france which has fought tooth and nail against an eu that is n't acting according to its own ideas and needs . 
  their problem is that most other eu members do n't particularly feel like playing resource provider or `` auxiliary '' and that germany is n't interested in playing ball , either . 
  my personal response to that ( as someone who works in frankfurt and sees more of these casino gamblers than he ever wanted to ) : what are 10000 bankers at the bottom of the ocean ? 
  answer a : a serious environmental hazard . 
  answer b : not much , but it 's a start . 
  [ warning !, 
  hypersarcastic rant ahead . ], 
   enforcing '' austerity '' [ blabla ] versaille treaty ... says a person from the one country who browbeat germany into the euro via threats of blocking reunification and whose press triumphantly declared a `` versailles treaty of modern times '' and `` germany will pay '' . 
  if you 're so generous why is n't your country opening its money spigots for greece ? 
  oh , i forgot ... it 's got ta be `` germany has to pay '' , right ? 
  quite honestly ? 
  a few more nations backing away from the hubris of military interventions would do wonders for international relations . 
  what have the iraq war and the libyan `` adventure '' gotten us into ? 
  a massively destabilized middle east and a failed state operating as shipping base for human traffickers . 
  well done , interventionists !, 
  + if your sarcasm detector does n't beep here please have it checked out by a mechanic + germans by and large question interventions in africa or the middle east in general as the underlying reasons for the conflicts are n't being tackled - in fact in most cases they ca n't be understood by outsiders . 
  and afghanistan has proved for all those involved that nationbuilding is an expensive hobby , one which nobody can really finance anymore these days . 
  hence the general skepticism towards the ** means ** . 
   germany really should learn from britain and france to look more outwards at least . 
  why ? 
  to conform to some political theory or foreign relations theory ? 
  to be a more useful auxiliary and resource provider ? 
  yes , ( west ) germans of all kinds drew one central lesson from world war 2 : never again shall military force be a tool for political purposes . 
  the formation of the bundeswehr in the 1950s was opposed by a broad coalition of people , not just the usual suspects from the left fringes but often veterans of ww2 , and any deviation from the strict self-defense outlook has been opposed by the society . 
  funnily that inward-looking meme was very much en vogue among and supported by the very same states that now lament it . 
  what was once wanted ( to calm jittery nerves among european neighbors of germany ) is now being derided as `` lack of solidarity '' , `` cowardice '' or `` freeriding '' . 
  but what is conveniently forgotten is that it was foreign interest that meshed with german introspection at the end of world war 2 and built a societal system that looks inward and is comfortable to remain on the sideline . 
  it worked for 4 decades and it fulfilled the interests of all involved ... and suddenly it 's 180 degrees the other way ?
