  it 's not democratic that other states can vote themselves to money to be transfered from other countries . 
  the eu is ** not ** a country , it 's a collections of independent states that have pooled * some * sovereignty , but in my book any such scheme is more than a few steps too far . 
  yes , the euro in its current form is unsustainable which is why i support its orderly dissolution and a return to national currencies . 
   if you ca n't agree to this then the euro has to end . 
  correct . 
   that 'll make you a lot poorer . 
  it will be survivable . 
  at least it will force reforms in germany as well and we may actually end up with a solid currency that has advantages not just for the export industries but for the common man on the street as well . 
   it was always intended that fiscal union would follow . 
  the euro-woolgatherers back in the 1990s * hoped * it would work this way . 
  the people never signed up to this ...  the current situation is untenable . 
  correct . 
  which is why i am for an orderly dissolution of the euro and a return to national currencies . 
  but we would be on the hook for 27 % of the money ( according to the eu treaties ) . 
  which is why this is n't an issue for the eu parliament but for the german one . 
  seriously ... the ez and the ecb were designed in the way they were specifically because the german society ** never ** agreed to being the euro 's backstop and the events of the last few years have affirmed that rejection . 
  germans may actually disagree with that idea . 
   the most important thing is some sort of fiscal transfers . 
  and guess what german taxpayers will not tolerate ? 
  being the ez 's `` deep pockets '' . 
  we 're already being taxed by our own system to a degree that is borderline acceptable , any further taxation - especially one that essentially means a wealth transfer away from germany - will not be accepted . 
  period . 
  people here are already pissed that while there is no money available to fix * our * roads , * our * schools or * our * modernization needs there somehow magically seem to be hundreds of billions available for banks , other countries , the eu or generally anyone that is n't us . 
  really ... try your scheme and watch what a really pissed german society looks like . 
  i bet it will be scary . 
  it would n't . 
  the compromises needed to have an actual fiscal union along with the monetary one were not accepted by the populations in the early 1990s ( hence the * not-quite-but-at-least-we-tried * kind of structure of the ez ) and are even less likely to be accepted today . 
  the issue is that `` europeans '' do n't exist in this respect - we are all split into various camps , camps that change membership depending on the issue that 's being argued about and we 're all expecting `` solutions '' that the other camp ( s ) are n't willing to provide or support . 
  gabriel 's main priority is gabriel and the public has long since noticed that . 
  i mean , merkel 's priority is merkel as well , but she 's a lot less prone to show-off type of behavior than gabriel and that makes it a lot more tolerable for common people . 
  just look at the current hullaballoo about the tengelmann-kaiser 's thing . 
  that is so obviously a self-promotional stunt of gabriel in the footsteps of schr\u00f6der 's actions in the hochtief case years and years ago that it makes him look desperate , prone to populistic `` snapshots '' and imprudent but he 's apparently unable to realize the impression he makes on people outside his circle of cronies . 
  the differing methods and procedures can be a problem , though . 
  i remember an article about a uk mech plt and a german pzgren plt training together on a german range . 
  the different methods for something a simple like a bounding overwatch required the german commander to modify his usual method and forgo his `` ingrained '' training . 
  this . 
  so effing very much this . 
  siggi-pop has less charisma than a random rock you pick up in the wilderness ( apologies to the rocks out there ) and has very little ( any ? ), 
  clue about what he 's actually doing . 
  the spd suffers badly from the non-characters in its leadership ( steinmeier , while relatively popular , included ) but gabriel is the epitome of that issue . 
  audi and its predecessors ( i.e. 
  horch ) came from saxony after 1945 ( zwickau , to be precise ) . 
  as normanbombardini said siemens left berlin after the war as well ( for obvious reasons ) . 
  look at the date of the article ... 2007 . 
  so who is practicing article necromancy here ? 
  [ sarcasm ] the international red cross reports that `` german national pride '' and `` willingness to protect the country '' have been missing since april 1945 . 
  the red cross assumes both were killed and given a mass burial in a bomb crater among the smoldering ruins of berlin . 
  i ca n't honestly tell you what i 'd have done in either case . 
  i 'm pragmatic , it would have depended on the circumstances . 
  not necessarily . 
  it depends whether they study or work close to their home , but most people i knew in school left home and went to other regions and cities - because that 's where the universities and the jobs are . 
  it 's not like everyone is lucky enough to get an apprenticeship position in his home region or that he happens to live close to a university which offers the degree he wants . 
  take me for example : i did my a-level at 19 , left home and went to berlin for my apprenticeship and have been living away from my home village ever since ( except for the usual visits during holidays ) . 
  that 's actually a rather common thing for many especially from the structurally and economically weak rural areas . 
  it depends , but mostly after finishing school when either going to university or entering the apprenticeship job training system . 
  a lot of people either willingly go to another region/city or because they have no other option . 
  the problem is that the language may sound good and all are using similiar if not the same words ... but fundamentally every nation means something else ( or prioritizes different things ) . 
  and let 's not even think about the drastically different political cultures & traditions . 
  compared to this the gordian knot was child 's play . 
  bavaria is a special case . 
  until the 1950s bavaria was a backward agricultural country ... but it profited massively from the influx of germans who had been expelled from sudetenland and the former eastern provinces . 
  many of those were highly specialized and restarted smes they had owned or worked for in their former homes . 
  additionally bavaria was the destination of several major companies that relocated their base of operations out of the soviet occupied zone ( i.e. 
  the predecessors of audi came largely from saxony ) . 
  the enterpreneur base for the sme `` ecology '' that is benefitting the state so much was laid then . 
  and on top of that bavaria was a net recepient of the intra - ( west ) german fiscal transfer mechanism - it was n't until the late 1980s when bavaria turned from being a net recepient to a net payer . 
   you are aware that whenever an eu army is discussed , special provisions for the french and british are assumed a given ? 
  france itself will continue to be interventionist in africa . 
  an eu army will not . 
  your assumption is by no means a given , france will fight tooth and nail against this defensive outlook . 
  take a close look at the history of esdp/csdp and how france tried to use this policy to get other eu members to provide ressources to underpin french foreign policy interests in africa . 
  this is a fundamental fact of french self-understanding and they will refuse to give up their strategic autonomy and their view that the eu is primarily a power enhancer for the french nation itself . 
  yeah , right ... and when the french president suggests another `` humanitarian intervention '' in africa the skeptical voices will all of a sudden become hawkish supporters . 
  people may like the idea of an `` eu army '' but only as an institution to which they hand hand off this `` despicable topic '' . 
  and then they play the moralizer and tell anyone that this `` military business '' is so immoral and that us germans are so much better because we 've gotten rid of our military . 
  that is another thing modern germans are good at - moralizing . 
  that 's the issue - we ( culturally ) do n't see this kind of projection as something necessary , desirable or even moral ... our notion of a military 's role is utterly and uncompromisingly defensive . 
  indignance . 
  why ? 
  because we 'd be royally pissed to be asked to pay a large share on top of what already gets transfered to brussels ' coffers . 
  besides the idea of an `` eu army '' is ludicrous in my opinion because the flea circus of 27 + one-soon-to-be-leaving could n't agree on the colour of decorations in the council chamber , let alone a purpose and structure for any such `` eu military '' . 
  i see and hear german politicians talk about it , but i know them and i know they are talking `` big words '' with little to no relation to any real life circumstances . 
  they 're grandstanding , nothing more ... and us germans let them talk because we know they 're too craven to even talk to us about military affairs so why should we take them serious when they have their heads in the clouds ? 
  it was a one-trick-pony ( speed bump for the red army `` until real soldiers arrive '' ) and many question its usefulness given the massive amount of nuclear firepower involved ( and planned for by both sides ) . 
  but as i said the cold war was a special circumstance ... and even then i wonder what the intellectual demilitarization would have done to west germany in case of a continuing cold war post 1989 ( nothing good , i 'm afraid ) . 
  i doubt we 'd see more spending . 
  you need to understand this : neither the political apparatus nor the public writ large has any clue what exactly to do with the bundeswehr at all . 
  we ( as a society and as a political system ) are intellectually so far removed from the way military affairs are being debated in other countries that all the suggestions and demands carried into the country from the outside are causing massive unease because of their very nature ( i think many regard the use of military force as immoral no matter the circumstances - yeah , we 're still fubared by the memory of ww2 ) . 
  in fact we have become such a consensus-oriented society that we ca n't deal with people or states who consciously , willingly and explicitly operate outside our established norms of debate , consensus and compromise . 
  we lack the will even for harsh debates , tough measures and ultimately lack any inclination to take a confrontational stance ( which may require a military component ) in the foreign policy sphere . 
  as i see it we are a liability for nato , we may be economically potent but we 'd rather be left alone and not be called up to provide something we are mentally and intellectually incapable of providing ( security , military power etc ) . 
  well , having this `` big stick '' provides politicians with a tool we 'd rather not give them at all . 
  burnt child dreads the fire , you know . 
  you really got no idea of the german mentality , do you ? 
  to cut a long story short : with the end of the cold war the entire reason to have a `` powerful military '' in the first place went away . 
  the central lesson many germans drew from ww2 is to limit the military to a strictly defensive role ... but without an environment which requires some point of military preparations there was broad consensus to massively downscale the thing . 
  besides : since 1945 germany ( neither west nor east nor the united one ) ever could guarantee its own sovereignty or hope to defend itself on its own . 
  the age of the nuclear warhead and long-range delivery mechanisms has seen to that . 
  hence we 're neither getting worked up about `` defending ourselves '' ( because if * that * war ever broke out we 'd have plenty of `` instant sunshine '' dropped on us anyway ) nor on `` muh sovereignty '' ( because we never could for the same reasons , either ) . 
  the presence of us forces on german soil has very very little ( if anything ) to do with the size of our defense budget .
