  harks back to a dark age which we should never slide back into . 
  projection requires means , yes - but also the will to project in the first place . 
  most germans these days can do fine without and i am one of them . 
  the switzerlandization of the german society has created a massive neutralist and isolationist sentiment that forms the base for poll results like the pew poll of july last year or the bertelsmann poll of march this year . 
  personally i see the fundamentally defensive outlook germans have on the military as a great thing - primarily because it deprives the political leadership of both the rhetorical instruments to justify the hubris of `` humanitarian interventions '' and ( even more importantly ) it deprives the political leadership of the military instrument to pursue foreign policy interests . 
   arguments like this are why a european country will never happen . 
  happy westerners wo n't ever give a shit about russia , and angry easterners wo n't ever give a shit about the sensibilities of the peace-loving west . 
  i agree ( though for different reasons ) . 
   [ ... ] considering that germany has a chancellor who is afraid of her own military and hates the flag of her own country . 
  merkel got burned by signing the open letter to the us in 2003 . 
  that support of the iraq war cost the conservatives an election they had considered won already . 
  merkel 's reaction ? 
  she 's stayed aloof from security and defense issues ever since . 
  this is n't a sign of being afraid of the military , it 's a sign of merkel 's priority which is retaining her power . 
  she views military affairs as a potential danger to her career ( with considerable justification , given for example the * causa k\u00f6hler * or said controversy over iraq in 2003 ) and thusly stays clear off it as much as she can . 
  and looking at the defense ministers she selected ( and how they acted ) it 's clear that she wants the bundeswehr to be as invisible and silent as possible - for the reasons i outlined . 
   what future does europe have when our most wealthy and influential country chooses to be a sheep in a world of wolves ? 
  i do n't know . 
  predictions about the future are notoriously unreliable . 
   but remember this : decades worth of admonitions to wind in the neck , not to be militaristic , not to be ambitious and to stay out of the spotlights have created a public mentality that does just that ( the switzerlandization i alluded to earlier ) . 
  get off your high horse , buddy , or the fall will seriously hurt you . 
  i 'm not one of these sanctimonious `` do-gooders '' or facebook warriors ( i do n't use that social media crap ) ... 
  i just refuse to take rhetoric crap from anyone , least of all the so-called `` elite '' . 
  i 'm too cynical and too sarcastic for that . 
  and as for history ... 
  i got a nice collection of books on history , military history is my hobby after all . 
  i also frequent websites and blogs on security and defense issues . 
  it 's not like i 'm ignorant of the world and its history , i just do n't take the rhetorical chill pills that elites are so fond of throwing around . 
  i see the world as a constant competition between different interests and all that smooth rhetorics is but pr hogwash to hide that basic fact . 
  addenum : looking at your flair let me use the western non-reaction to the soviet squashing of the hungarian uprising in 1956 to make my point clearer . 
  everyone has interests - rhetorically the us had put itself on a pedestal and declared to stand up for `` freedom '' . 
  but in this case hungary and its people were simply not important enough to wage a nuclear war for `` values '' ( and neither were the gdr in 1953 or czechoslovakia iun 1968 ) . 
  ** that ** is the reality i am alluding to - rhetorics are for pr and public consumption , but decisions are driven by hard interests . 
  do you support the creation of an eu army ? 
  would you join it voluntarily ? 
  would you support a draft ? 
  would you sacrifice a year of two in basic training if mandatory ? 
  4 . b would you support mandatory basic training of an year or two ? 
  are you physically able to join it ? 
  ( gender does n't matter ) - ** no ** ( got a nasty chemotherapy a few years back ) * 6 . ), 
  do you have relevant skills you could bring into it ? 
  which role/branch would you like to serve in ? 
  - ** none ** addenum : not because i 'm a bleeding-heart-liberal of head-in-the-clouds pacifist , but because i refuse to play cannon fodder for the 1 % . 
  and then ask the people who should pay for all of this and the answer is most likely going to be `` someone else than me '' . 
  that is why those polls mean squat , people do n't think about the sordid details of such lofty rhetorics ... but once they become visible suddenly everyone scrambles for the exit . 
  verhofstadt can lament and yammer as much as he wants , he ( and his ilk ) are not getting my mandate to create a superstate . 
  i 'd rather have a return to the pre-maastricht eec , thank you very milking much . 
  quite frankly : wars are being instigated by the 1 % who hope to profit . 
  but the 1 % wo n't fight their wars , they expect the 99 % ( us ) to fight them - and the best us 99 % ers can hope for is to return without being harmed in body or soul . 
  i have long since decided that when someone comes at me , my family , my friends and my immediate neighbors with a meat cleaver and ill intent i 'll forget my good manners and put a few dents into his disposition and his face . 
  but do n't ask me to fight other people 's wars , especially not those instigated by the 1 % . 
  period . 
  yeah , whatever ... have fun in your own little world . 
  and you fail to remember that desert shield and desert storm were gulf war number 2 ... and that saddam had been washington 's best buddy in gw number 1 against iran . 
  or shall i dig out the well-known photo of a younger rumsfeld shaking saddam 's hand ? 
  talk about selective reading of history ... 
  as someone born and raised in former eastern germany : you go not idea what socialism really is so do yourself a favor and do n't use that term . 
  it makes you look silly . 
  i was more talking about interventions in the middle east or africa . 
  given the fact that we have a solar installation on our roof that generates more energy than we 'll ever need and our village has put together money and bought a biogas plant we 're quite independent from the big corporations . 
  as such it is doable , it was n't very well planned and executed on the governmental level ... 
  i 'm not sad about that ... after all we were fleeced by the energy corporations ( who have socialized the associated costs while pocketing the gains ) for decades . 
  i 'm not sad to see them taken down a few notches ... 
  which is why the notion wo n't fly . 
  cee states wo n't support any such venture that 's not focused on staring at russia , france wo n't allow any such venture in which they do n't call the shots , have fun talking the neutral irish and swedes into something like this and even more fun asking the german population to underwrite that . 
  let 's spare us the time we 'd waste on this potential clusterfuck , okay ? 
  certainly . 
  the entire thing began with a headline that he 'd been `` on the wrong side of history '' over the tunisian dictator ben ali . 
  it really had the whiff of `` presidential campaigning military style '' . 
  true , but if you think back to 2011 and especially 2013 i vividly remember a royally pissed french government that was `` not amused '' about other european nations not following their lead ( to libya and mali ) . 
  let 's leave it at that , shall we ? 
  i read `` defense policy '' essays like `` germany and war '' ( published by the french mod ) which clearly lists the `` wants '' of the french government . 
  it 's clear that france would like to call the shots and has aspired to transplant its worldview onto other eu members ( with germany in the forefront ) - without any success whatsoever . 
  as such my comment reflects reality far better than this obfuscating `` european '' rhetorics of sugarcoating everything . 
  recent debate on some german website . 
  a 16-year-old describes the debate on article v in his class . 
  of 15 male teens only 3 would accept a call to arms , 12 would `` simply leave the country '' . 
  any further questions ? 
  still does n't mean i give a flying fart about `` dictators '' across the globe . 
  i look at my country and see enough stuff to watch closely , i do n't feel any missionary spirit to bring `` democracy by jdam '' in countries far away . 
  look , that `` projection '' mindset of the us has no counterpart in germany . 
  if anything we were told since 1945 to wind in the neck and get our own sh * t in order . 
  that 's what we did , that 's what we still do ( and the german people would mostly like this to stay as it is ) . 
  this `` oh , we need to dispose of that evil dictator '' talk sounds too neo-imperial for my ears , it reminds me too much of the wilhelminian grandstanding and kicks in my self-defense against public figures spouting bs . 
   far as i 'm concerned the alliance died in 2003 when some nations thought saddam hussein was the good guy . 
  if that is the intellectual level of the debate in the us then i can only say good riddance . 
  if the `` alliance '' died in 2003 then only because enough people told bush jr he was being nuts ( and rightfully so ) and he and his ilk did n't like being held a mirror to look into . 
  the french military is strained , not just by these `` small '' deployments but also by their domestic deployments in the wake of the terrorist strikes since last year . 
  on top of that come the french fiscal problems resulting from their stagnating economy and the french political establishment 's inability to reform that . 
  it 's always been an official french government position that the eu should underpin and support french foreign policy ( especially in their former colonial empire in africa ) - but eu members have not played along ( much to the frustration of paris ) . 
  that 's what 's driving hollande 's rhetoric and what does doom his attempts even before he started . 
   do you know why the cap exists ? 
  part of the reason is because it is dangerous for an entire continent to rely on cheap food exports and loose the capability to feed its own population , so europe subsidizes expensive domestic agriculture . 
  looking at the history and the intricacies of the cap it looks a lot more like france trying to uphold a fantasy lala-land for its agricultural sector through eu subsidies so that its own farmers do n't get culture-shocked by the realities of the 21st century world markets for food . 
  oh no , mister hollande ... 
  this is not about `` solidarity '' , this is about you wanting to utilize other european militaries for your post-colonial meddling in former french colonies in africa , is n't it ? 
  you ca n't have your cake ( full french strategic autonomy ) and eat it ( = a `` european '' defense policy and structure ) at the same time . 
  right now you just wish to outsource costs to other states because you ca n't make ends meet due to your inability to reform your own economy . 
  no , i have to disagree . 
  imo identities have to grow naturally and no amount of `` top-down '' push will work .
