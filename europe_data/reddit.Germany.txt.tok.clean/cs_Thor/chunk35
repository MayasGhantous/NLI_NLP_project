  articles are way over the top , no matter whether they decry a brexit or a trump presidency . 
  as for obama 's free rider comment i am beginning to wonder if it 's a major difference in understanding the word `` alliance '' and the nature of nato between the atlanticist countries and most of continental europe . 
  in germany the view is that nato is but a fall-back for the worst case , an insurance against something everybody hopes will never come . 
  this view does n't come with any other obligations , certainly not of being obliged to deploy military force for every intervention the thinktankers and chickenhawks dream up . 
  that would contradict public mentality , decades of constitutional practice and self-view of most germans , generations of whom have experienced nato as a strictly defensive institution ( while deployments of military force to support the foreign policy of various countries remained strictly national endeavours ) . 
  but judging by comments made by both brits and americans i wonder if they think differently and expect things that germans are n't willing to give and do n't consider part of the parcel . 
  it 's something to ponder ... 
  the author made the same mistake as all too many of his compatriots outside germany - they mistake the `` lip service '' as a real deal . 
  it 's easy to do so - when you fail to `` dig deeper '' , do n't look at the public mood and attitudes and just copy the pr releases of the ministery . 
  i sometimes wonder whether this uncritical `` copy & paste '' of authors comes from the content matching their own world view . 
  has the author ever heard of `` lip service '' ? 
  because that is a much better and fitting description than this long-winding article . 
  a few specific comments :  how far this thinking has spread outside the political and military elite is open to question . 
  not far ( if going by various recent polls ) , but then the political body has n't even tried to communicate with the constituency over this . 
  too afraid for their petty little careers . 
   polling shows that `` the general public is not very comfortable with the military dimension , '' said sylke tempel , the editor of international policy , the magazine of the german council on foreign relations . 
  quite an understatement imo . 
   the policy-making elite , on other hand , know that `` strategic thinking includes the notion that you have to build a force in order to be taken seriously , and that you have to spend on this dimension , '' ms. tempel said . 
  this i doubt most vehemently . 
  the `` elite '' ( a term i use very hesitantly here ) is being pressured by the foreign partners to put forth capacities in this area but they have neither a clue nor an understanding of the entire security & defense policy area . 
  most of the nonsense they publish/say on this makes me want to smash my head against something hard repeatedly ( so that this pain overlays the other ) . 
   germany should expand its military `` as quickly as possible , as much as possible , '' said dr. bartels , a member of the center-left social democratic party . 
  ah , yes ... this so-called `` expert '' ... who has dutifully waved through all the cuts of the past ten years and then some . 
  and now he 's playing the `` concerned expert '' ??? 
  if credibility bit you in the a *** , mr. bartels , you still would n't know what that term means . 
   despite the announced expansion , he noted , military spending is in danger of sinking to 1.08 percent of germany 's gross domestic product , which he said would be its lowest ever -- and well below the 2 percent that nato member states committed to spend at the alliance 's last summit meeting , in wales in 2014 . 
  back then member states signed an ** aspiration to spend 2 % of gdp in ten years ** . 
  but then merkel never had any intention of ever going there . 
  and as it is the money `` envisioned '' until 2020 wo n't even be enough to fix the most glaring shortcomings . 
  this is * lip service * , no more . 
   populists in such movements have little interest in knitting together trans-atlantic interests and deploying allied forces for common goals , he said . 
  and most germans have no particular interest in seeing german soliders deployed as auxiliary forces of other states and reject interventions . 
  well , duh !, 
  that no-holds-barred debate about defense policy is 25 years overdue , mr. kamp . 
  but with politicians incapable , unwilling and too craven to initiate it the current `` pretending '' is about the only thing that 's to be expected . 
  i know it pains thinktankers that the government does n't listen to them , but that 's the risk of the job . 
   in german politics , the post of defense minister has traditionally proved difficult . 
  the job is prestigious , but plagued by difficulties in securing finances and suitable , modern equipment . 
  the job is an ejector seat and the current minister got it by the inverse process of `` musical chairs '' - she was the last one left when the other departments had been assigned . 
  and to date her main priority has been to create well-sounding media headlines and not be inciminated by scandals . 
  fixing the bundeswehr ? 
  so much less important than the political survival of ursual von der leyen . 
  as an eu `` superstate '' : not going to happen unless it 's build by broad public support ** and ** while the publics understand the sacrifices they would have to make to make such a union work . 
  as it is we 're removed generations if not centuries from such a position of `` unity '' ... and it 's actually not a given that we 'll ever make it there . 
  as it is an economical club with rather loose political structures is about the only thing that really may work for europe at this point , because in key political topics ( economics , finances , foreign policy , security & defense etc ) attitudes and political cultures are so diverse that they ca n't be amalgamated into one overarching policy . 
  that 's quite a ... * strange * list wrt foreign policy , defense and security . 
  france and the uk are close enough to cooperate in this manner ( despite having decidedly different attitudes to atlanticism ) but germany is definitely an outlier here ( and belgium as well ) and while the dutch have no qualms to use military force they have become much more reticent of late ( mostly because of a public opinion that seems to be rather close to germany 's `` not our problem , not our business '' ) . 
   i agree with / u/lion _ lxiv here , the german intention was to gain access to the english channel and the north sea however this was prevented , therefore the principle german aim failed , whereas the british aim of maintaining the blockade was upheld . 
  the immediate tactical aim of nearly all larger german naval operations by the high seas fleet was to bring part of the grand fleet to battle and destroy that part before the superior main fleet core appeared . 
  that was true in 1914 at dogger bank and was true in 1916 . 
  the german ships did n't have the range for ops beyond the north sea confines and not the extensive support net the royal navy could rely upon to resupply its ships . 
  as such the blockade could only be broken by whittling down the grand fleet and then seek a decisive battle to `` settle the matter '' . 
  but after the battle of jutland ( or battle of skagerrak as it is known in germany ) emperor wilhelm forbade further operations because he feared losing his favorite toys . 
  the rest is history . 
  the problem with the `` integration '' since 1990 is the unnecessary acceleration put in practice by a few political figures and a faceless bureaucracy in brussels . 
  the eec was fine and accepted by the people and there was no reason to give them the middle finger and `` integrate '' ( which at the moment looks a lot more like disintegrating ) . 
  because i do n't believe in the pr hogwash of `` ever closer union '' nor do i support the forced federalization of european nations into some amorph `` european superstate '' , and to put the cherry on the icing the eu bureaucrats justify that with the ludicrous argument that this is `` inevitable '' . 
  sorry , but not in my name . 
  pot calling the kettle black ? 
  we all know the nature of the eu institutions ( calling them potemkin 's villages would be an exaggeration of their status ) . 
  i was merely astonished that tusk spoke as a representative of this usually self-important tribe , those who usually spout rhetorical nonsense in masses ... 
  could it be ? 
  the first time i actually agree with someone holding a high post in the eu ? 
  let 's leave the migrant thing out of this debate because it 's not relevant here ( and because it 's by no means an uncontroversial thing here in germany ) . 
  military force , according to popular mentality and a de-facto constitutional practice of over four decades , is useless and even immoral for anything but strict self-defense . 
  given the lack of a perceived threat many people would question the plausibility of such an increase and point to other domestic areas which could use the money ( like debt reduction , like infrastructure , like education ... ) . 
  the environment for serious defense spending that fits within this public mentality is n't there ... and to tell the people that `` self-defense '' actually also means defending the baltics and poland if push came to shove would require politicians who do n't run for cover whenever defense issues are on the plate . 
   is it really that wrong to care about a fellow europeans country ? 
  it is n't , but given the lies we 've been told for far too long about `` europe '' ( beginning with the famous `` no-bailout-clause '' of the maastricht treaty ) many germans are resorting to resigned cynism and translate any `` foreign care '' as `` how much money do they want this time ? '', 
  the french consortium has extensive experience with building subs this large , tkms does n't . 
  and its design is based on an existing sub . 
  two points that may have been make or break criteria , especially if the aussies wished to minimize potential teething troubles ( and associated cost overruns ) . 
  but alas , that 's all speculation . 
   yes , but germany 's isolationism can not be traced to the last years alone , it has been a consistent feature for decades . 
  that is correct . 
   the difference now is that it is germany which is the laggard , and it is germany which has to match the commitment of others , notably france and the uk . 
  so that quote in this context is fundamentally a misguided application of it . 
  actually using that quote is my personal way of saying that the eu is n't a union because there is only one uniting reason to be a member : making a profit . 
  i do n't believe in any of that tosh about `` shared destiny '' or `` european identity '' . 
  to me that 's all pr hogwash and doublespeak . 
  and as for the uk and france being the rolemodels germany ought to emulate ... 
  both have always thought of their own national interests first and foremost and have only couched those in these well-sounding `` european terms '' when it suited their agenda . 
  and both have remained largely aloof in the confrontation with russia ( in practical terms , that is ) beyond the usual rotational stuff precisely because they wish to keep a hand on their national military assets and have operations of much greater national interest ( i.e. 
  mali for france ) . 
  we should not kid ourselves that any nation is altruistic in its conduct on the european or international level . 
  that would be shortsighted and dishonest . 
  and who should pay for that ? 
  you will not become popular among european taxpayers by having vast amounts of money transfered to brussels for something most people do n't consider `` theirs , too '' . 
  i simply think any talk of some mythical `` european army '' is hogwash and head-in-the-clouds woolgathering . 
   i do n't see how those two are mutually exclusive . 
  germany almost certainly does n't want to raise its spending on its own and maintain a big army ( you could be quite powerful if you wanted to ) , at the same time , it understands the need of a federal army . 
  here you are simply wrong : germany does n't `` understand '' the `` need for a federal army '' because the german socio-political culture has no use for military power beyond the strictest of self-defense , because politicians perceive security and defense issues as potential danger to their careers ( i.e. 
  causa k\u00f6hler ) and because they perceive decisionmaking in this area as politically costly they are talking the talk ( with the unmentioned hope to be freed from this chore by some undefined eu institution ) so they can wash their hands in innocence on the domestic political market . 
  at the same time they do not pay enough attention to the very real pitfalls and problems that would need to be solved to have a go at a federal army : least of all the need to explain to the german voter why germany should send x % of gdp annually to the eu to pay for the german share of the federal army 's budget or the need to sell to german voters that the eu has decided to engage in this or that policy/intervention even if public opinion in germany is opposed . 
  the german political class is united in despicable cowardice in the face of the voter and the maximum one can expect from them is meaningless blather designed to weasel out of a debate they perceive as dangerous to their careers . 
   the biggest problem is not the military or the political leadership , it is the isolationism of its people . 
  in a time of economical and political turmoil it 's normal that people pull up the drawbridges and resort to near-tribalism . 
  the various crisis have shown what this so-called `` solidarity '' really is - a smokescreen to hide bismarck 's old adage of `` hearing the term europe from the mouths of those who do n't dare to demand something in their own name . '', 
  do n't think so ... 
  the problem is there is neither a shared `` culture '' in security & defense ( what is perfectly acceptable in one state may be a gross violation of socio-political standards in another ) nor is there a shared threat perception ( i.e.
