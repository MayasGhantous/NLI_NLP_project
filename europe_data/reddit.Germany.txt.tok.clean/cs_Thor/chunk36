  baltics/poland and their focus on russia vs france/spain/italy and their focus on instability in the mena region ) ... basically a military is about the ultimate issue in sovereignty of a state and despite all the lofty talk of `` ever closer union '' the practical pitfalls make the mere concept unworkable without a unified european identy and statehood . 
  not going to work . 
  those who use military force for their foreign policy ( france , uk ) will never allow their sovereignty in this to be diminished , those who do n't refuse to commit out of fear of being dragged into conflicts they 're not interested in and in the end it 'll be just as much a question of who pays what ... aka an unending clusterfuck . 
  the theory sounds good , the practical pitfalls make it unworkable . 
   if that does n't become the case , for nations like germany sooner than later , i want the us out of nato . 
  you 're free to choose your own path ...  it 's not just the money , though the fact of many developed western european nations with hugely comfortable welfare states suckering us into spending on their defense is an annoyance . 
  and your own military-industrial complex and its connections to much of the us political establishment have nothing to do with the amount of money the us spends on defense ? 
  really ? 
  quite honestly : the german public does not perceive a military threat against the country . 
  despite the current somewhat permissive climate for more defense spending ( to fix the equipment shortfalls of the bundeswehr ) i doubt a virtual doubling of expenditure would go down well with the ordinary taxpayer , especially if you ca n't provide a good reason for doing so beyond `` because other countries are pestering us '' . 
  oh , and did i mention that we 'll have a federal election next year ? 
   it does make sense for germany to increase their government spending since the long-term goal of the eu is a federal military . 
  you misunderstand the reason why german politicians talk about that : it 's but a politically correct ( even if thinly veiled ) attempt to foist the domestically unhelpful topic of security and defense onto some undefined european institution . 
  it 's basically a veiled cry for `` ca n't someone else do it ? '', 
  i 'm calling bs on this one . 
  why ? 
  because the type 216 is a design draft , it does n't exist in real life . 
  so how the heck did the aussies `` measure '' noise emissions ? 
  by rubbing a crystal ball ? 
  the real issue is most likely that the german type is a design draft whereas the french is an existing product . 
  i 'm afraid germany has n't understood anything in that respect - what is happening is the usual minuscule reaction to international pressure , a `` bending to the wind '' if you like . 
  the society does n't debate such stuff ( and if asked directly most people wish to stay clear of any confrontation with russia ) and politicans do what they have always done : react only when they ca n't put that off anymore and only with the smallest possible action . 
  welfare is supposed for those who do n't ( or ca n't ) work . 
  ah , yes ... that faux `` argument '' again . 
  the hartz reforms were ** not ** about wages , the state has ** no authority ** in this area and the wage moderation was the result of unions and employers ' associations agreeing to preserve jobs at the expense of wage growth . 
  the hartz reforms were about trimming back a very generous social net because that is what the state can decide on . 
  wages are not part of that so please do n't spread such false platitudes . 
  and you need to get out of the artificial bubble that assumes europe is a separate entity isolated from the rest of the world . 
  german products are n't of the low-cost category , anyway , but we are competing with the other big heads of the world economy : japan , china , the us , increasingly india and the likes ... artificially lowering competetiveness will lose this competition and then we can all be equally miserable in our little insignificant europe . 
  is the euro workable ? 
  no , it is n't and it should never have been attempted . 
  it was always a political project with enough financial and economical voices speaking up with doubts . 
  which is why i think it needs to be dissolved because attitudes and views are too different and in large parts opposing to allow for any `` one size fits all '' economic and fiscal policy . 
  but to ask citizens of a sovereign state to artificially undermine their own economic livelyhood is just utter madness ... in germany just as in greece ( or italy for that matter ) . 
  alternatively : gib euromonies , plox . 
  a ) german companies have tried moving to china and other low-cost areas but a good number of them ( most ? ), 
  have returned to germany for various reasons ( quality issues , issues with education of employees etc ) . 
  it 's not as if they have n't tried , it 's that they have but did n't like the results . 
  b ) germans are penny pinchers . 
  paid services have always had trouble here ( i.e. 
  pay-tv never took off as much as in other countries or remember the walmart fiasco a few years back ) . 
  as such it may be difficult to put a reliable number on any service sector deregulation ... 
  besides : with eastern europe right at our borders who said that the south would be the prime profiteer in this ? 
  i personally think using `` hitler '' in debates as some kind of thought-terminating clich\u00e9 is generally an admission that one does n't have other sensible arguments , but alas ... 
  i just think the language in the uk over the referendum has become increasingly hysterical , from both sides , and that ai n't a good sign in my view . 
  apparently german unions differ from others ( given cultural differences not surpsising ) , but i had n't counted on them having common sense being the most drastic difference . 
  johnson used that `` fourth reich '' bull **** that only imbeciles and nutjobs use . 
  as a qualified historian he should have known better . 
  z651 is right - it 's a british domestic affair , but i also agree with you that both camps have descended into using imbecile and embarrassing `` arguments '' . 
  yes , misters johnson and cameron , i am looking at you !, 
  to be honest being allergic to inflation is not about the hyperinflation of the early 1920s but the very real fact that germans are avid savers . 
  and inflation eats up income from savings ... 
  you fail to take into consideration the specific predisposition of germans towards saving . 
  i , in a way , am probably the stereotypical german overdrawn to carricature when it comes to money - i could easily afford a much more affluent lifestyle , a bigger apartment and lots of `` consumption '' but i simply do n't need it . 
  instead i `` save '' ... meaning i have money on my bank account and in a fixed deposit , avoid risks like the plague and follow the `` do n't spend more than you have '' . 
  it 's simply ingrained ... 
  so there have been voices ( of those much more informed about economics than myself ) wondering whether the orthodoxy of increased consumption would do anything to even budge the needle for the southern economies ( imo with considerable justification ) . 
   the problem is , rnd is almost non-existant in germany painting with a very broad brush here ... you are aware that only constant development is what keeps a lot of smes in the market and at the top ? 
  i think claiming that r&d is `` almost non-existant '' is far off the mark . 
   why do you assume doubling of wages in germany can not happen ? 
  why ? 
  because i see the real world and not this theoretical construct you 're trying to build . 
  which employer would happily agree to a doubling of costs for production in a cut-throat market as the world market is these days ? 
  open your eyes and smell reality - europe is no closed entity separate and distinct from the rest of the world . 
  emerging markets in all of the world are happily gobbling up those market shares that countries unwilling and unable to adapt are losing . 
   yes , some jobs would be lost . 
  they would be transferred to the southern countries . 
  that 's the whole point , to restore competitiveness of half the eurozone . 
  are you really this naive ? 
  the jobs would n't go to the south of europe , they would move to low-cost areas like china or other se asian countries . 
  there is a world outside europe to compete with !, 
   if there wo n't be european solidarity then we ca n't have open borders or a shared currency . 
  on the euro we agree - which is why i think it 's best to scrap the thing . 
  as for shengen ... it depends . 
   the people voted for the governments that made the open borders happen and created the euro . 
  in the german case the kohl government ( who later admitted having `` acted like a dictator over the euro as there was no way i could have gotten a democratic majority for the euro introduction '' ) was blackmailed into accepting the euro by french president mitterand who was playing a geopolitical game and tried to limit germany 's economic power by burdening it with being europe 's paymaster . 
  that failed when germany 's position was affirmed by the maastrict treaty . 
  as for voting ... 
  when all your democratic alternatives are united in unthinking `` europeanness '' and the only skeptics are those unelectable and undemocratic right-wing fringe parties ... where is the democratic process of choice here ? 
  `` europe '' has been an unchallenged dogma for far too long in far too many countries but it was imo inevitable that public opinion would at some point form an unmovable block because of this dogmatic adherence to the concept without a parallel democratic debate . 
   that fault lies with the people . 
  the fault lies with political establishments who have failed to engage publics in open and honest debates about the eu and what it is supposed to be . 
  instead they have presumed to have unlimited authority to move towards a barely defined `` federalization '' whithout ever having bothered to ask for public support , without having listed possibilities , risks , costs and potential gains and now they wonder the people refuse to grant them any further leeway ? 
   then why should the citizenry have a vote ? 
  are you even a democrat ? 
  what is the point of elections to you ? 
  to see which great leader entertained the populous the most ? 
  this . 
  apparently the federalist dreamdancers are getting antsy that the `` plebs '' is n't buying their eussr fantasies and resort to `` federalize ... or else '' and the disdainful comments about public sentiments that have surfaced recently . 
   then the germans could have had their wages doubled , which would restore a lot of problems of competitiveness with the southern countries . 
  must be nice in your little theoretical world of fairy tales and woolgathering . 
  in reality , however , wage setting is done by the labor unions and the employer unions and they do bargain without state interference or state guidance . 
  and show me the union who 'd demand doubling of wages knowing very well that the counterpart ca n't pay that and it would result in a massive loss of jobs . 
  and who would win in this ? 
  not the other european countries , it would simply be a race to the bottom and be as miserable as everyone . 
  winners would be the guys in asia , period . 
  that kind of argument is ludicrous , it may work in the theoretical world of economic fairy tales and game theory but it crumbles on the shores of reality . 
  even worse is the assumption that the `` silent majority '' is always going to sign up to these federalist fantasies . 
  if anything the past has proven that once the price of something becomes visible support takes a serious plunge . 
  and i am absolutely sure this silent majority does not know about the devil in many details - precisely because politicians do n't reveal it out of fear of being told to stop this nonsense at once .
