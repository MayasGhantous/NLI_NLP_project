  if so where have they been hiding it ? 
   seriously : the notion was that an independent currency could make greek exports more competetive vis-a-vis german exports . 
  given the nature of german exports as high-tech high-price industrial goods and me not being aware of a similar industrial setup in greece i probably went a bit too far with that sentence . 
   both shipping and tourism are exports for greece . 
  both of these would do better if greece were out of the euro . 
  the devil in the details here is , however , the greek dependency on a large slice of imports ( agricultural products , medicine , energy etc ) . 
  that would become a serious issue for ordinary people with an independent drachma . 
  because * that * currency would drop in value like a stone dropped from a cliff and would make imports seriously more expensive . 
  my pleasure . 
  the question was asked during the run-up to the referendum in 2015 . 
  ** wikipedia article ** ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_bailout_referendum,_2015 )  public opinion strongly favours keeping the euro . 
  [ 37 ] of all the political parties which won seats in the parliamentary election in may , only the communist kke expressed support for leaving the euro , and indeed for leaving the european union . 
  [ 38 ] [ unreliable source ? ], 
  unfortunately the [ 37 ] link leads to a 404 page . 
  ** politico article ** ( http://www.politico.eu/article/greece-euro-exit-grexit-greferendum-bailout-debt-creditors-eurogroup/ )  recent polls suggest that the vast majority of greeks -- about 80 % -- want the country to remain in the euro . 
  ** reuters article ** ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-europoll-iduskcn0pk1wf20150710 )  a total of 84 percent of greeks want to keep the euro , with just 12 percent favoring a return to the drachma , an opinion poll showed on friday , as the country races to clinch a cash-for-reforms deal with its creditors . 
   the poll by metron analysis for parapolitika newspaper showed that although the overwhelming majority of those polled want to remain in the single currency , 55 percent said it was the right choice to vote ` no ' in last weekend 's referendum on tough austerity measures . 
  ** ekathimerini article ** ( http://www.ekathimerini.com/198471/article/ekathimerini/news/greeks-want-to-stay-in-eurozone-two-polls-show ), 
  not in the cards . 
  most people in the `` net payer '' states are n't insane enough to go down that route . 
  correct . 
  but at the same time greeks did n't ( still do n't ? ), 
  want to leave the ez for reasons i ca n't really understand . 
  maybe it has to do with a fundamental distrust in their own leadership and `` elites '' ... 
  greece ca n't live off tourism alone , especially not since it has to import virtually all of its energy needs , a lot of agricultural products and medical stuff as well . 
  the problem of greece is the quota of state spending - the state spends 49.8 % of the entire gdp . 
  without additional sources of income ( exports in goods or services ) it simply ca n't sustain its model of the social net . 
  it could buy itself time by leaving the eurozone but even with its own currency and the ability to devaluate it will reach a point where the state and the authorities ca n't avoid some seriously tough and far-reaching decisions . 
  actually he supported a charity that is awfully close to salafist organisations and which a charity watchdog considers dubious because of the shady nature of their reporting . 
  there have been incidents where money was supposed to go to projects like those advertized ( water , food etc ) but did n't really end up there . 
  some think the charity has hidden ties to organisations like the al-nusra front ... 
   without euro , greeces drahma would be worth less , therefore its products could compete with german products . 
  greek stuff would be cheaper . 
  that presupposes that greece actually has products it could export . 
  last time i checked most of its economy was focused on shipping and tourism , not exactly `` exports '' ... 
   seems its designed that way . 
  actually it was n't . 
  the euro was a french-led attempt to break the dominance of the bundesbank on fiscal matters * and * as a political measure to bind the united germany into the european structures . 
  as such it was and is a very political thing and a lot of voices in the 1990s ( including nearly the entire german society and all of our economists ) said the idea was economically and fiscally unsustainable because it would require compromises nobody was willing to even think about in the 1990s and nobody is going to accept these days , either . 
  the effect of a weak euro is that it further boosts german international competetiveness but it certainly was n't a conscious design choice . 
  if he believes in those things then he has to talk about it during the campaign , his rivals will not allow him to skirt that question . 
  and if he does concede that he would go down this path ... the spd will be back to 20 % . 
  at best . 
  that presupposes he 'll manage to find coalition partners . 
  as i outlined both potential coalitions in which he could actually be chancellor are very unlikely . 
  but if he really does that i guess we 'll find out how big protests and demonstrations in germany can become these days . 
   a schulz-macron alliance could finally re-boot the euro , creating the momentum for the genuine fiscal , monetary and economic union that the single currency needs to become if it is to have a genuine chance of success . 
  the problem with this view is that right now the cdu remains the strongest party in polls and any coalition option for the spd to govern contains some seriously big question marks . 
  die linke is too dogmatic on a number of issues so red-red-green is looking rather questionable and the only other theoretically viable coalition - spd-green party-fdp - founders on the mutual dislike and ideological differences of the greens and the fdp . 
  if current polls were to remain as they are the cdu/csu would emerge as strongest party and the only mathematically possible coalition would be a continuation of the current grand coalition . 
  but if the question of further euro integration comes on the table during the campaign ( like eurobonds , like fiscal union , like transfers etc ) then schulz will have to show his true colours on the matter . 
  if he decides to campaign on the basis of supporting those measures he may actually lose his chances to achieve a good result for the spd because the public mood in germany on these matters is utterly forbidding and seriously hostile . 
  schulz could do little more to hand merkel a boon for the campaign than by supporting `` fiscal union '' . 
  fun fact : the last `` free '' prussian corps under general l\u2019estocq ( an old fierce cavalryman who 'd fought in the 7-years-war ) and his `` right hand '' - the term chief of staff was unknown in the prussian military at this point - gerhard von scharnhorst not only led marshal ney 's much larger corps on a wild goose chase but also stabilized the critical situation on the russian left flank ( which was about to collapse ) . 
  and then they moved separately from the russian main body towards preussisch friedland to shield benningsen 's force from being cut off from their lines of communication . 
  that kind of arrangement , an older `` figurehead '' to lead the army supported by a highly trained younger staff officer , would become standard for the prussian army in the decades to come ( bl\u00fccher and scharnhorst / gneisenau in the campaigns of 1813 to 15 , `` moltke 's demigods '' in the wars of 1866 and 1871 ) etc ... 
  but i do n't think i need to tell someone with * that * username . 
  nuclear sharing is based upon tornados and that role ( and especially the money tied to it ) is one of the things the bundeswehr and government do n't like to talk about at all - precisely because of the potential public reaction . 
   but why not build up the french arsenal , have a common deterrent and paying for it ? 
  try to run that past the german society and you 'll get vaped , too . 
  procuring nuclear weapons or paying someone else to maintain them ... 
  i do n't think most people would think it much different when they howl in protest . 
  besides this * herr kiesewetter * and his colleagues have to this day refused to hold a normal debate on defense matters in the bundestag or even start a society-wide debate on such matters with the constituency . 
  as such the lack the credibility to speak on the matter , they should shut up and let the adults talk about things they do n't dare talk about at home . 
  i must be losing my coherence if i can not make myself understood . 
   no , i was trying to point out that not working ( or only part time ) is not a choice many people have , because it would deprive them of much needed income . 
  and yet the tax system supports or even prefers such models because it is rooted in an outdated understanding of the economic roles of man and woman and needs to be updated . 
  sorry if that still is unclear , it 's not my most eloquent day , apparently . 
   i see how affordable daycare would be the better solution , but it 's probably not that easy or i am sure people would have jumped at the business opportunity . 
  given that childcare is a very thoroughly supervised and highly regulated market there is simply no great private offer ... most daycare is being provided by federal , federal state or municipal institutions . 
   if a mother is earning less than 1800 to 2400 in that region , does n't make sense for her to work full time . 
  quite honestly not everyone goes home with 2,4 k a month , i do n't earn that much myself . 
  but given the high costs of living not working is not an option for 99 % of the people here . 
  simple as that . 
   it just sounds like a good measure to fight low fertility rates . 
  actually it does the opposite . 
  these days only a tiny amount of well-off people can afford to have one partner work and provide the income while the other stays at home . 
  the overwhelming majority either needs both partners to work full time or face a seriously degraded standard of living . 
  but the tax rules do n't really reflect that modern economic reality . 
  if the state really wanted to improve the probability of young couples having children then we 'd need nationwide and especially ** affordable ** daycare for children and not just from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. but to 6 or even 7 p.m. 
  the non-availability of such daycare at rates ordinary people can actually afford is what keeps a lot of couples from having children in the first place , because they have to choose between a severely degraded standard of living with children - because either one partner has to stay at home to care for the kid ( s ) or because an insane amount of money is being asked for daycare - or a decent life without kids . 
  an example : my own brother and sister-in-law had relatively well-paid jobs in the region of lake constance but when my niece was underway they found themselves unable to find daycare they could afford ( prices ranged from ridiculous 900 euros to ridiculously laughable 1200 euros a month ! ) . 
  as a result they moved back to my home region in the german east where they earn a good 30 % less than where they had been but actually were able to get a daycare slot for my niece for a price they could actually afford . 
  the problem with daycare is a mix of federalism issues and a longstanding standoff between paleo-conservatives who seem to be unable to drop the 1950s model of a family and the modernizers . 
  not really . 
  german tax regulations are somewhat `` outdated '' and encourage women - as / u/journo127 said - to stay at home or work part time at best . 
  the problem is that this may have worked in the 1950s and 1960s ( when most of these tax codes were introduced ) but not longer reflect economic reality of 2017 . 
  there is , however , not only a general hesitance to even tackle tax reforms ( because the entire system is so complex and complicated ) but also because a ) lots of actors will want to voice their particular wishes and b ) there is an ideological standoff between `` modernizers '' and `` traditionalists '' ( which also plays out in other areas ) . 
  which means , in the worst tradition , politicians tend to kick that particular can down the road . 
  it 's a really hot political potatoe . 
  it 's a question connected to the demographic change . 
  a low % of women participating in the job market means a country does n't use its `` human resources '' optimally . 
  also these women will have little to no old age pension leading to an increase of old age poverty . 
  there is federalism and there is bs federalism . 
  education is one of the few `` natural resources '' we have and we can no longer afford to have sixteen competing educational systems . 
  not with asia and india rising . 
  in 1949 giving education to the federal states looked like a sensible safeguard against a centralized indoctrination of the youth , but this has mutated into a carnival of ideological `` pet projects '' that make even comparing the achievements of a school graduate from bavaria and hamburg pretty difficult . 
  the problem is - once again - the omission that education is firmly in the hands of the federal states . 
  these federal states guard that `` sovereign right '' like a hen guards her hatchlings but they do n't have the financial wherewithal to modernize and upkeep the schools and universities . 
  we do n't have one educational system , we have 16 ( !! ) .
