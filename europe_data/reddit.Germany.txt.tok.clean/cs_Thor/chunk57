  that is n't the case and wo n't be for a long , long time ( if ever ) . 
   if the eu ca n't make war , then it is pretty silly to build it an eu army . 
  i think the author never bothers with looking at `` eu competences '' because it has virtually nil in this respect . 
  and that is how it will stay for a long , long time . 
   this is something i 'm not entirely convinced of , though many english newspapers say this often . 
  in some of the brexit talk i recognize pure protectionist tendencies . 
  i actually agree . 
  part of the motivation behind brexit is precisely that protectionist thinking , not in the political sphere but in the societal one . 
  best quote of the article ( because that is * soo * effing true ) :  mistrust is especially pronounced between the large member states . 
  the brits are suspicious of everyone . 
  to the germans , the french mean france whenever they say europe . 
  and as far as paris is concerned , a common european defense means rallying europe behind french interests in africa . 
  the problem is you can only ignore the population in a democracy only for so long - at some point they 're going to elect someone else and all those grandiose plans may go down the drain . 
  much more importantly the entire political apparatus in germany is frozen with fear , not fear of russia or terrorists but of having to carry any personal responsibility in areas which they ca n't use to push their personal standing . 
  and as far as defense issues are concerned all of them would like to foist this area off onto some undefined eu institution ( while retaining the veto to avert things that could be domestically damaging ) . 
  the entire bundestag is full of spineless cowards who do n't even have the guts to debate the recent white paper in the bundestag because they fear repercussions in next year 's general elections . 
  thanks , that 's my reading as well . 
  i think the real message was lost in translation . 
  that 's my view . 
  eh , because the british debate had centered on refusing the concept in principle and that the telegraph 's article hinted at a solution in this direction ? 
  merkel simply said we may be talking about details ( i.e. 
  like limiting certain welfare access to people who have worked for x years in the country ) . 
  it basically means the discussion can be about details , not about the principle . 
  ps : merkel also said that it 's an irony that it were the brits who lambasted germany for having negotiated these transitional solutions in the first place and now demand exemption . 
  careful what you wish for ? 
  quite frankly : people like hofreiter are the epitome of `` wash my fur , but do n't make me wet '' folks . 
  he represents a part of the greens that has an intolerable `` we know better '' type of views , kind of the notorious `` oberlehrer '' who always knows best . 
  veggie-debate from 2013 , anyone ? 
   `` that 's why i think we need to have another discussion with the eu commission on when this freedom of movement is valid . '' i do n't agree with that translation , because it implies she would question the validity of the basic concept . 
  what she said was that the concept itself is not negotiable - and then made references to detail solutions and especially the case of germany having negotiated transitional solutions after the accession of the central and eastern european member states . 
  that is what she meant - application of the concept in detail , not the principle in general . 
  well then reuters is also guilty of inaccurate reporting . 
  or is it interpretation ? 
  well , well ... looks like the british press is reduced to fabricating stories that bear no relation to reality . 
  whistling in the dark ? 
  several german newspapers run stories in which she explicitly rejects a compromise with the uk over this . 
  addenum : looks like there is a video of her speech and after watching it i can only reemphasize what i said above : the telegraph is inventing something for domestic comsumption , but it does not report what merkel actually said . 
  she said that the freedom of movement is not negotiable . 
  period . 
  what she did say is that it will need a debate between member states and the commission to spell out in greater detail what this means in practice ( as current regulations seem to be open to some kind of `` interpretation '' ) . 
  the greens have been see-sawing between their realistic and idealistic ( nutjob ) wings and party leadership is currently firmly in the latter camp . 
  i have trouble seeing the greens agreeing to such a coalition , especially given the rhetoric hofreiter and his ilk have been spreading of late . 
  now if the realistic wing were in the lead that would be a possibility , but it is n't ( despite the fact that only realo candidates got decent votes of late ) . 
  different electoral system , different realities . 
  the only truly realistic chance of merkel not becoming the next chancellor is a left-wing coalition between spd , die linke and greens and that is not really realistic because die linke is too dogmatic on a number of things ( foreign policy first and foremost ) . 
  the afd polls somewhere between 10 and 13 % right now and given that no party would do a coalition with them they 'd have to achieve a complete majority ( +50 % of the bundestag seats ) to govern . 
  which is , pardon my french , a ludicous idea to begin with . 
  quite frankly - i look at the * substance * of the rhetoric coming from german politicians on this and i ** do n't see any substance ** in their words . 
  why ? 
  a ) two weeks ago the german newspaper die welt brought an article in which a member of the bundestag 's defense committee complained about having approached merkel on a debate about security and defense policy in 2014 - only to never get any sort of reply . 
  in the same article the author laid out how the two governing parties are suppressing any attempts to even hold a debate on the recently published white book in the bundestag , because they fear repercussions and a debate they ca n't control in advance of the federal elections in september next year . 
  why should i take serious any of those `` big words '' from politicians who are too craven to even debate such issues in their own parliament ? 
  b ) there is a brilliant article in the berlin policy journal named * `` europe on its own ? 
  * ( http://berlinpolicyjournal.com/europe-on-its-own/ ) which really hits home with some very direct issues . 
  my most favourite quote from it is this ( because that is so effing true ) :  mistrust is especially pronounced between the large member states . 
  the brits are suspicious of everyone . 
  to the germans , the french mean france whenever they say europe . 
  ** and as far as paris is concerned , a common european defense means rallying europe behind french interests in africa . 
  ** ( my emphasis ) france has a certain cultural and political way of viewing military power and its application in support of foreign policy . 
  this view is not only heavily contested in germany , the majority of germans will * never * stand for this . 
  which is why i regard all this hullaballoo about franco-german cooperation in this area as pointless bluster . 
  politically , mentally and even structurally france and germany are polar opposites when it comes to the military , because both states have drawn diametrically opposed consequences from past experiences . 
  why should two so fundamentally different states manage to make something work in the military area when it would take some very serious ( and supremely unpopular ) compromises to even make baby steps ? 
  case in point is the french interest in africa which is not matched by anything similar in germany . 
  quite the contrary - politicians and people alike are wary of french maneuvering , the former because of experiences made over the congo deployment in 2006 , the latter out of principle . 
  yes , that is the article . 
  but it does hold more substance than any of those `` pr releases '' because it is disarmingly honest about the deep deep divisions between the various states . 
  de maiziere - also known as `` misere '' ( misery ) . 
  bland , drab aparatchik and bureaucrat with the charisma of a piece of coal . 
  has repeatedly put his foot in his mouth - both during his terms as minister of defense and as minister of the interior - but is saved by his bureaucratic talents and his loyality . 
  von der leyen - aka `` flintenuschi '' - self-confident to the point of obnoxiousness , quick to resort to pr-savyy tactics and projects but often a bit light on substance , and - worst of all - true `` believer '' in the `` europe dogma '' ( no matter the costs and regardless whether something makes sense or not ) . 
  as such i heartily agree with svorky . 
   what the fuck does `` empower brussels '' even means ? 
  it means either setting up a `` brussels institution '' with the political power to decide on military operations , defense spending or projects connected to defense issues ( and i mean * real * political power unlike the deadbeat eda ) * or * putting such issues up for majority voting instead of the current consensus model . 
  neither is attractive to member states because they do not want to lose their veto . 
  period . 
   all of the strategic and policy making in eu institutions is done via consensus among eu member countries , and i highly doubt we would n't have a similar system to the eu council if we decided to move towards an unified military . 
  there is ** zero ** agreement among the eu 27 +1 about pretty much anything in the defense sector . 
  which is why this `` eu army '' talk is so moronic - nobody is going to give up these national prerogatives and especially the ability to veto stuff one does n't like . 
  exactly . 
  it 's smokescreen rhetoric to hide that nothing is to be done - nobody wants to `` empower '' brussels and everybody disagrees on aims/goals , means or priorities . 
  self-serving and megalomanic reading of a meeting , which - according to an article at heise.de - merely served to reinforce the deep divisions among european member states . 
  the french fm was n't there , neither was the british and the german hightailed out of the meeting after a few minutes to go back to berlin ( and on to ankara ) . 
  there was no unity in evaluating trump , there was even less unity in drawing conclusions and making suggestions how to proceed . 
  some want to deal with trump , some want to `` remind him of shared values '' , a few want to `` emancipate europe from the us '' and the eu talks this hubris of `` superpower '' bull * feep * . 
  * yeah , right !, 
   the idea that all a strong military is good for is fighting wars on the other side of the world is a very short-sighted one . 
  from a german pov and given the current ( and forseeable ) international situation it perversely would . 
  germany as a society , mentally and politically , does not perceive a direct military threat against us and is equally loath to intervene in conflicts in far-flung regions of the world . 
  hence the unwillingness to finance a `` strong '' military because all that would do is drag us into conflicts not in our interest . 
   a strong and large military can have many uses , but the most common and most noticeable one is disaster relief . 
  pardon my french , but that 's grasping at straws . 
  even a `` weak '' military can deliver on this for the most part . 
  but in general there are various non-military actors who are equally suited to disaster relief present in most countries ( we have the * technisches hilfswerk * which is a non-military technical aid agency ) . 
  a `` strong '' military 's purpose is to generate military power - disaster relief is but a byproduct of this and not a particularcy important one . 
   but the whole self-understanding thing ... there 's a difference between self-understanding and self-flagellation . 
  i mean ... the german position makes absolutely no sense to me in a world where the japanese self-defense force a ) exists , and b ) caught shit from domestic sources because they wanted to release a patch with a katana on it and since katanas have even the tiniest tangential link to imperial japan half the diet flipped their collective shit . 
  yes wwii happened . 
  it 's also been 70 fucking years and unless merkel is playing a game of chess that has so many dimensions it would cause a quantum calculator to have an overflow error , i think it 's pretty clear at this point that germany could be trusted with a large and powerful military again . 
  there are certainly people who would subscribe to this `` former alcoholic long since dry '' theory , but i do n't .
