  it would be nice , but unfortunately germans themselves are susceptible to this net of taboos ... nobody wants to be labeled a nationalist or even worse a closet-nazi . 
  that 's a tad too simple imo and ignores the number of political taboos in germany . 
  part of the initial hostility towards the afd ( before it was highjacked by the closet-nazis ) came from the party 's anti-euro program which broke the political consensus ( a fancy term for `` topics that must not be debated '' ) . 
  there is much much more euroskepticism in the german society than the election results suggest . 
  the problem is that it has no outlet because the only ones being skeptical of the eu are undemocratic or have other points in their programs that make them unelectable to large parts of the society . 
  i objected to the assumption that by voting for certain parties everyone agrees with a certain view of europe . 
  i 'd love to have a democratic euroskeptic party in germany , but i know why it wo n't happen ( too many taboos , too much political correctness ) . 
   german aggression by needlessly taking alsace-lorraine . 
  which had been a german province until the 17th century when french aggression under louis xiv had led to its loss . 
  but i guess if it was n't done by germany it 's okay , it 's only germany that turns that into something unacceptable . 
  you look like the old cartoon ... the one with the historian going through a library of books and documents declaring imperiously  i wo n't give up . 
  even with the punic wars there must be a german who is responsible for them !, 
  but alas ...  but yeah man , literally all countries in europe were identical , all wanted and supported a war in identical amounts , despite how unlikely it is !!!, 
  identical ? 
  they were simply focused on their own national interests and were no less likely to resort to military force . 
  no great power became one in that age by being a nice and cuddly pushover . 
  no , that 's `` interpretation '' ... 
  the british society had experienced bouts of anti-german rhetorics as early as 1870/71 and with the accession of the throne by wilhelm ii the official and public attitudes cooled seriously . 
  wilhelm has had a hand in this , most obviously via his role in various issues such as the kruger telegram ( a congratulatory telegram for the president of transvaal for resisting a `` british raid '' against jamestown in 1896 ) , but there was an anti-german streak in british society that ca n't be ignored ( i.e. 
  a series of novels describing german invasions of the uk ) or headlines such as that of the * saturday review * in the wake of the kruger telegram affair :  `` be ready to fight germany , as germania delenda est '' ( germany is to be destroyed , a reference to rome 's treatment of carthage ) . 
  the major bone of contention was of course the german fleet program - which was seen as a direct threat against the uk and the empire . 
  as it had been traditional british policy to play the offshore balancer ( by opposing the `` continental hegemon '' ) and keep the system of power in balance germany became the target for british `` disaffection '' because it was the largest and most powerful state in central europe ... as such the uk had an interest in seeing german power recede , but i think they never realized that the time of the old balance-of-power game was over . 
  as such the invasion of belgium gave a timely and sustainable justification for the uk to enter the conflict . 
  i am so convinced of this because i firmly believe that even if wilhelm had not supported vienna in this case a major conflict in europe would have erupted sooner or later - in exactly the same constellation as it happened in 1914 . 
  the conflict of interests and the balance of power simply made that inevitable . 
   if that were the will of a large section of the voters , that would have been reflected in the politics conducted by both the elected eu institutions and elected eu governments . 
  objection . 
  in the german case we have no democratic party that challenges the `` consensus '' of the major parties over europe . 
  the only ones who actually present a clear alternative are unelectable parties on the extremist fringes , the nazis and hard-left nutjobs . 
  as it is us germans are denied a true democratic alternative on this topic ... 
  although one could argue that the german invasion of belgium was merely a convenient justification which british anti-german hard-liners had not had before . 
  given the level of antagonism towards germany that had taken root in british high-level politics in the years before 1914 i doubt not invading belgium would have changed much - the uk would have joined the war ( just with another justification ) . 
  which glosses over that the very same nationalist and militarist processes were at work in paris , london and st. petersburg as well . 
  was wilhelm complicit in all of this ? 
  yes , of course ... but no major power was unwillingly dragged into this conflict - paris wanted revenge for 1870 , britain had long since resorted to anti-german rhetorics because of their long standing `` offshore balancer '' role and the tzar was looking for a vent for the growing demands for reforms of his medieval state system . 
  germany may have given austria the go ahead for lighting the match , but the powder and the fuse had been placed cooperatively by all european great powers in the two decades before . 
  here we agree ( and not just because it would force the political clowns in this country to actually do something ) . 
   they do n't want to do it . 
  correct . 
  why ? 
  because we never wanted to in the first place ( and have been ** very ** clear about this ) - in fact us ordinary germans were never given a truly democratic way of deciding whether we want to be involved in any of this or not - and now we have even less trust ( the fundament for any such exercise ) in other european states . 
  who the hell would agree to what amounts to being fleeced by other eu member states , some of which who do n't even have the decency to admit their own faults over the past decades in economic , social and fiscal policies ? 
  i 'd be prepared to take the ( big ) hit a euro dissolution would cause for me and germany , but at least then nobody can pretend the issues are n't his and us germans will no longer be the cash cows other states want to plunder to uphold their unsustainable state models . 
  euroskeptics have nothing to do with this . 
  actually i am a euroskeptic ... to me all the lamentations about `` germany is destroying europe '' is the simple attempt at not having to look at one 's own issues . 
  greece has had a refugee problem along with italy ( and therefor , actually , the entire eu ) long before last summer ... but what the developments have ( or at least should have ) revealed is that no eu member state is subscribing to this lofty rhetoric bullshit of `` european solidarity '' or `` european identity '' and that trying to invoke them only makes the one invoking them look absolutely ridiculous ( and here especially merkel ) . 
  i 've always regarded that as utter tosh - to me eu membership ( or non-membership ) is solely based on different national interests . 
  what you see in the case of the refugee issue is a bunch of political taboos in germany coming home to roost - namely the taboo of even debating about a system of immigration ( because even talking about limits would be * sooo * racist ) , the taboo of revealing lofty ideals to have limits ( because they provide morality +15 , you know ) and the taboo of debating hard national interests ( because that 's * soo * 1940s nazi language ) . 
  essentially europe got caught in merkels rhetorical clumsiness but she is caught in a web of taboos , topics not-to-be-debated and our teutonic political correctness that keeps her from changing course . 
  the argument from juncker is lame ... 
  visiting war graves can be a lesson in many things , but that does n't mean one has to sign up to the federalist idiocies that come from the most ardent eutopians . 
  the better question is what those yammering about `` germany is destroying europe '' doing ... and the answer is `` seeking the easy scapegoat '' . 
  but that 's a tactic as old as civilization . 
  sorry , we have no spare rommel to send . 
   you are making that up . 
  tell us about that nonmeddling germans . 
  thousands of redditors with `` germoney '' `` mama merkel '' `` schaeuble is ze devil '' makros would like to hear !, 
  please note * ordinary germans * ** ! = ** * german politicians * ... a lot of thinktankers despair at the resolute refusal of the german society to conform to their expectations ... to be outward-looking , willing to join any military adventure there is , be willing to spend money on stuff that pertains to this area , to `` play hardball '' . 
  go look at what has come out of paris , out of london and especially washington about how they 'd like germany to act . 
  on afghanistan , on libya , on ukraine , on syria ... and every single time the german people have signaled `` we are not interested in ` more responsibility ' '' . 
  that may be a reduction to military affairs but in general germans do n't look at the world and think `` oh , this is an issue we need to solve '' . 
  most of us here are inward-looking , our focus lies on solving our own teutonic messes ( and there are enough of them ) . 
  a nice anecdote about this refusal to `` assume more responsibility '' was the day when the german federal president , the german minister of foreign affairs and the german minister of defense all held speeches at the munich security conference in 2014 telling germans to `` assume more responsibility '' in the world . 
  the very same day , even before the speeches had been held , a poll came out which asked germans that very question . 
  in this poll 62 % rejected more military missions outside germany and a further poll , made in the run-up to the german mfa 's `` review 2014 '' , saw 64 % of germans wishing for more reticence in foreign policy and 83 % wanted less bundeswehr participation outside the country . 
   yeah , russia , china , usa , uk and france will be impressed and will give the germans i.e. 
  veto power in the un ... and btw , what is the benefit of being the the clown without military power on the big stage of the world ?!, 
  the only `` clowns '' in this security council sharade were and are the german politicians who talked about that . 
  ordinary germans have always treated such aspirations with the derision that deserved ... because we know the same politicians who blather about this are unwilling to even assume personal responsibility for any deployment of the military anywhere so why should we , the sovereign , give them even an ounce of support in such obvious hubris ? 
   you sir , are either naive or high . 
  i am cynical and realistic . 
  germany is n't capable of being a leading power . 
  our people are inward-looking and pacifist , our politicans managerial and total cowards ( who do n't want to assume any kind of personal responsibility ) . 
  and the very same things that would need to be changed to allow any kind of true `` leadership '' are the very fundamental things that have been tainted by that `` austrian corporal '' 70 years ago . 
  look at all the major controversies over military issues since 1990 - as early as the gulf war in 1990/91 there was scathing criticism because germans rejected participation in wars , and when the red-green government strove for a participation in kosovo and later in afghanistan they had to blackmail their own parliamentary factions into compliance because too many of their own mps refused to agree to the proposal . 
  germany as a whole simply lacks the ambition to be `` relevant '' in foreign policy . 
  a handful of thinktankers and politicians may talk about it and lament it , but in general germans are quite content to remain on the sidelines of big policy and be mere onlookers . 
  quite honestly merkel may have had a hand in creating the fairy tales that the people smugglers tell the those who come ... you know , those ludicrous stories of a waiting job , a big house and a luxury life . 
  after all she could ( and should ) have said and done things very differently . 
  she could have hammered out a bilateral agreement with tsipras behind closed doors and ship a number ( a big number if needs be ) to germany via aircraft . 
  that would have resulted in a somewhat orderly process , would not have overwhelmed local authorities here and in the states in between and would not have created all the frictions inside germany and within europe . 
  * that * would have been `` responsible '' , as it is she was just utterly clumsy and pigheaded . 
  i do n't think he was being literal nor is there such a phrase on `` slang german '' . 
  i think what he means is that he would lose another pillar of the conservative economic thinking in europe as opposed to the french ideas of etatism and statism . 
  sch\u00e4uble may be a convinced `` european '' but that does n't mean he agrees with french ideas about economic and monetary policy . 
  * ahem * ... chuck norris does n't have tears . 
  tears are afraid of chuck norris . 
  actually sch\u00e4uble is a fossile , one of the last holdouts of true `` europeans '' in german politics . 
  he actually believes in `` ever closer union '' and all that tosh , but as i said he 's one of the last of his kind . 
  no , he 's known informally as * darth kassenwart * ( kassenwart = treasurer ) . 
  apart from some hair-raising stupidy ( * france is our mum ? 
  the article does have a true core . 
  us krauts are inward-looking and do n't particularly care for all the attempts at pushing us on the big stage of the world . 
  in a way we live in an age of neo-biedermeier , seeking escape from the ugly headlines of the world press in an orderly life and a private niche in which we can shield us from what 's assailing us ( via the media ) . 
  and when the outside world wants us to `` take up more responsibility '' we tell them , with increasing volume and anger in our voice , to `` get lost '' . 
  absolutely . 
  have a nice weekend . 
  must be because i give the greens a wide berth . 
  they 're far too `` we know what 's good for you '' for my liking ( veggie-day , anyone ? 
  i do n't buy the lofty talk of `` values '' or `` principles '' in general , because i find these terms so wonderfully `` moldable '' , so beautifully `` adaptable '' to suit pretty much any situation .
