i have been following the news and reactions very closely and have n't heard of any statement by an eu politician that the uk has to be punished now . 
  it 's mostly `` not the result we wanted , but we do respect the wish of the british public '', 
  i would have preferred if the piece commemorated all deaths of wwi and not only the british ones . 
  as one art crtic put it , it depicts the war as a national tragedy with 850,000 victims . 
  not only in the south , griechenland is standard german and understood/spoken in all parts of germany . 
  grekenland is west low german ( nieders\u00e4chsisch / nedersaksisch ) . 
  but it also confused me , it does look like it 's the official word in germany . 
  the first word uitvoering has the same origin ( and usually the same meaning ) as the german `` ausf\u00fchrung '' ( you pronounce `` ui '' like `` au '' and `` oe '' like `` u '' , so it sounds very similar ) , but means `` baustelle '' in this case . 
  you seem to be right , in the same study ( i 'm still referring to op 's source ) it 's shown that guns are less likely murder weapons in northern europe . 
  it may be the combination of a high rate of gun ownership and high occurrence of alcoholism ( which is much higher in finland than in sweden ) . 
  if you take a look at the source it shows that in finland much more murders were linked to alcohol than in sweden . 
  homicide rates , not suicide rates . 
  but many people in finland [ own a gun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ) , that 's probably a reason . 
  but what 's up with wallonia ? 
  weird !, 
  edit : according to the source a vast maiority of the finnish murders were strongly connected with alcohol . 
  `` red riding '' looks good , i 'll check that out . 
  but i think there 's more to scandinavian noir than a `` troubled protagonist '' . 
  i ca n't describe it well , but i think for example that in scandinavian shows the acting/dialogues are closer to real life , while in british shows the tragic hero expresses himself in a very articulate and dramatic way . 
  in other words , i think a john luther puts on a show and sarah lund does n't . 
  i love luther , but for me it 's a different genre . 
  maybe i 'm wrong and there 's another reason why scandinavian shows are so popular in the uk recently . 
  do you know any comparable british examples for [ scandinavian noir ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_noir ) ? 
  broadchurch may be one , but it has been heavily influenced by the scandinavian dramas on bbc four . 
  btw , i 've started to watch that series klovn that you recommended and i really like it . 
  but humourwise it 's a lot like the american sitcom `` curb your enthusiasm '' ( which i love btw ) or even more like the german version `` pastewka '' . 
  it does n't seem that particularly scandinavian . 
  that 's why i wrote that i wished they asked someone who is more competent in writing opinion pieces like that . 
  i did n't imply that the swedish are more prickly than the danish , i just thought that they easily could have found much better and more representative responses for sweden and co. 
  i can only speak for myself , but i think nordic humour is refreshing because it 's so different from the usual one you see in comedies . 
  but i can completely understand that it may get tiring if you grow up with it . 
  i did n't realise that you were scandinavian , in that case i would have replied in a different way . 
  i guess for the same reason i 've heard many danish complain about those danish crime shows like forbrydelsen or broen ( `` they are boring '' , `` they all follow the usual pattern , grim atmosphere with troubled protagonists '' ) . 
  those shows are a huge success in other countries because for the british for example that is a completely new concept and different from all those american shows with their endless hollywood tropes . 
   lars is a man , but okay . 
  oh sorry , i knew one of them was a woman but apparently it 's the norwegian one . 
  i did n't really check the names properly . 
   i think the original article was n't very humours to begin with . 
  what kind of answer did you want , when the premise was that sweden is supposed to be a totalitarian state ? 
  i did n't like the original article either . 
  i think the danish reply was very appropriate , the author made some light jokes without appearing too offended or defensive . 
  after all it 's just a british expat promoting his book by being provocative , nobody should take it too seriously . 
  it was embarrassing in my opinion because the author did n't realise that the original article was n't meant to be taken entirely serious . 
  she sounds way too serious for response to a deliberately provocative article . 
  denmark and finland did the right thing by brushing away the criticism lightly and showing some humour . 
  but now that i reread the whole thing , i may have to correct myself and say that the icelandic response is way worse than the swedish one . 
   the responses demonstrate lack of humour - a common nordic trait . 
  i would argue that the brits have the best sense of humour . 
  have you heard of norwegian comedy , or swedish ? 
  no , who has . 
  the nordic countries are famous for their unique , usually dead pan humour . 
  if you are n't familiar with it i can recommend comedies by anders thomas jensen from denmark , josef fares from sweden or the finnish director aki kaurism\u00e4ki , each funny in their own way . 
  just because you have n't heard of norwegian comedy does n't mean that it does n't exist . 
  i for one could n't describe french or italian comedy but no doubt it exists . 
  edit : to be clear , i agree that the norwegian and icelandic responses were prickly and immature , i just disagree with your comment that nordics are generally humourless . 
  i wonder why you single out the danish commentary as it was the best one in my opinion , for showing humour and being quite reasonable , unlike the original author michael booth . 
  the swedish and norwegian responses were plain embarrassing , i wish they asked some more competent people to comment on the original article . 
  finnish humour is hilarious , there is more of it in the comments :  a finnish man might tell his wife he loved her . 
  but only after they 'd been married for 50 years . 
  and on her deathbed . 
  and only once . 
  -  i remember reading a newspaper story about mauno koivisto , the president of finland in 1982-2000 , and his wife . 
  if i remember correctly , after some years of marriage , his wife had asked him if he still loved her . 
  he replied to the effect that he had already once told her he loved her , and if the situation changed , he would let her know . 
  you ca n't really compare drug testing and the criminalisation of prostitution . 
  i am against mandatory drug tests because it 's a huge violation of privacy and because smoking pot does n't do any harm , so i do n't see the reason why it should be illegal . 
  prostitution on the other hand can be very harmful - there are many prostitutes who are coerced into their profession , it can be a dangerous profession and i think only very few would keep doing it if they had any other option . 
  the only people who profit from prostitution are the pimps and johns , so i do n't really understand how so many people here can be in favor of it . 
  btw , i am talking about street workers and prostitutes from brothels only , i think it 's a very different matter if you 're a high-end escort or offer your service on a private basis with no connection to the red-light district ( and afaik they do n't enforce the law in sweden if that 's the case ) . 
   instead of banning prostitution and making all prostitutes right-less criminals again they would n't be criminals , according to the article `` schwarzer and her supporters have championed the legal situation in sweden , where it is illegal to buy sexual services but not to sell them '' . 
  the only consequence for the prostitutes would be a decrease in customers . 
  well , i get your point , but i do n't think the `` it does n't matter anyway '' philosophy does any good . 
  according to you it would be a waste of time and money to fight human trafficking at all because they would just find some way around it by trafficking them to another country . 
  in europe those organised gangs have the biggest markets for prostitutes and sex slaves . 
  i am convinced that if there 's less demand in europe they 'll force less women into prostitution because it just would n't be worth it anymore . 
  even if it wo n't be avoidable to stop human trafficking completely it should be necessary to make it as hard as possible for them . 
  i do n't think you should compare insurance fraud with human trafficking . 
  [ a maiority of the prostitutes are migrants ] ( http://euobserver.com/social/29340 ) who are probably only working in that industry because they have no other option . 
  because the industry is so heavily linked with human trafficking and other criminal activities i do n't see many upsides to prostitution to be honest . 
  women who completely volunturaliy choose to prostitute themselves still can do that ( in sweden ) without fearing any legal consequences . 
  insurance fraud is a completely different matter , especially because there are many reasons why insurance should exist . 
  oh , you seem to be right , i mixed up prostitution and human trafficking [ in this article ] ( http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0cc4qfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.legaliser.nu%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2ffiles%2fthe%2520strict%2520swedish%2520vs_%2520the%2520loose%2520dutch%2520system%2520for%2520regulations%2520on%2520prostitution%2520and%2520drug%2520use.pdf&amp;ei=qzmbuqzqm-thywocjidaaw&amp;usg=afqjcngjn93aig8ddpuevquaz_krkz5ymq&amp;sig2=cgqum-8lro-d30a4-bwefw&amp;bvm=bv.57155469,d.bgq&amp;cad=rja ) , i 'm going to change it in my comment . 
  but my point still stands , [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/may/27/prostitution-norway ) it says that sweden became unfavourable for human trafficking groups : `` we know from our colleagues in estonia who have eavesdropped on traffickers that they consider sweden to be a bad market . 
  they can no longer send the women on the streets , which was the easiest way to find clients . 
  now they have to find flats for the women , they must advertise on the internet , and clients are afraid of getting caught . 
  [ traffickers ] think it 's not worth doing business in sweden . '', 
  [ it does n't seem to work though ... ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2011/world/europe/03/30/cfp.denmark.sweden.sex.trafficking/ ) as long as there 's a market , organized crime will find a way , even if there are strict laws against pimping/human trafficking/slavery . 
  i do agree with you , but i think that unfortunately there 's no better way to fight human trafficking than criminalising prostitution . 
  if you read the sources i 've posted in my other reply , you 'll see that legalising prostitution strongly encouraged human trafficking and criminalisation strongly discouraged it . 
  there 's no ideal solution , but i personally think that having less prostitues who work under worse conditions than before is preferrable to having many prostitutes that work here against their will . 
  [ a translated dutch article on the current situation ] ( http://fleshtrade.blogspot.de/2006/02/abuses-in-prostitution.html ) [ amsterdam restricting the red light district because prostitution got out of hand ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/world/europe/24amsterdam.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all&amp; ) [ prostitution in norway , discussing both pros and cons of legalisation ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/may/27/prostitution-norway ), 
  the problem is that many women only end up working as prostitutes because there 's such a high demand . 
  just recently a prostitute from the ukraine was brutally murdered in bielefeld , she only came to germany because she was promised a different kind of work from her pimp . 
  the liberal dutch approach completely failed because it resulted in a stark increase in human trafficking . 
  i think that women should be able to voluntarily work as prostitutes , but because is so much organized crime going on in the red light districts i am glad that this is being discussed recently . 
  much better , thank you !, 
  the colours are really hard to distinguish as a colourblind ... 
  it took me some time to figure out that east germany does n't overflow with women . 
  it 's in the basement of the dumont-carr\u00e9 . 
  there are cheaper italian supermarkets in cologne , but i 've never been to one that has german or international products as well .
