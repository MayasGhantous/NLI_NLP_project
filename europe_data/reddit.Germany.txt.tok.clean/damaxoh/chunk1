what are you talking about ? 
  the thing has just now ( 26.09.2014 ) been published to the public . 
  the european council and the eu parliament must approve the deal no matter what . 
  i highly doubt this will happen if puplic opinion is against it . 
  plus there is the high probability that the 28 parliaments need to ratify the agreement . 
  it is highly probable that the 28 parliaments need to ratify the agreement . 
  and this wont happen with ceta in it 's current state since it is undermining the regular court system . 
  germany 's government made it clear that while it supports ceta in principle , it will not sign the deal with an investor dispute mechanism in place . 
  germany is supporting the treaty but wo n't sign it in it 's current state . 
  i do n't see how this is a finalized thing and why there is reason for celebration . 
  germany 's government made it clear that while it supports ceta in principle , it will not sign the deal with an investor dispute mechanism in place . 
  germany 's concerns centre around the investor-state dispute mechanism that is part of the deal . 
  it would allow companies to sue governments , outside the regular court system , for losses caused by a government policy . 
  many in europe fear that an investor dispute clause would allow companies to essentially override national laws through lawsuits . 
  true and sad ... 2000 years later and we still come to the same conclusion, 
  why should n't the sale happening ? 
  the [ u.s. ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-08/exxon-drilling-russian-arctic-shows-sanction-lack-bite.html ) is doing oil business as usual , too . 
  [ heuchler ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/09/russia-rosneft-exxon-mobil-idusl6n0qf0b220140809 ), 
  yeah , while exxonmobil starts drilling for oil in russia 's [ arctic ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/09/russia-rosneft-exxon-mobil-idusl6n0qf0b220140809 ), 
  [ us embargo against cuba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_embargo_against_cuba ) in response to the cuban alignment with the soviet union during the cold war , president john f. kennedy extended measures by executive order . 
  so much for  sovereign states and free people you ca n't be a part of it because your neighbor does n't want you to . 
  sure !, 
  [ commission regulation ( eu ) no 666/2013 ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2013:192:0024:0034:en:pdf ) article 1 point 2, 
  this regulation shall not apply to - wet , - wet and dry , - robotic , - industrial , or - central vacuum cleaners - or to floor polishers, 
  for what it 's worth , i am very happy the commission is doing this -- energy efficiency is good , it needs law to make it happen . 
  free market wo n't do it in this case, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/arts/design/german-artists-say-they-put-white-flags-on-brooklyn-bridge.html?_r=0 ) the u.s. reaction was priceless, 
  i do n't think so . 
  the underlying conflict is n't addressed at all . 
  i expect a ongoing insurgent activity in the eastern ukraine . 
  i like how you roll . 
  sorry for my lack of motivation . 
  i put myself in the shoes of the russians and the west which does n't seem to happen a lot in / r/europe . 
  but his is required to analyze the conflict . 
  ideology is strong where understanding of the `` enemy '' is forbidden . 
  it always amazes me how one sided some people look at this conflict . 
  while exxonmobil began drilling in russia 's arctic on saturday ... 
  thank you , i could n't have said it any better . 
  what frightens me is how public opinion is being shaped by mass media ( in russia and in the west ) . 
  people take a position which is comparable to the enthusiasm of football fans or religious fanatics . 
   up - / downvote for quality , not content !, 
  this is simply not the case in / r/europe and i do n't think the posting of / u/boq is appropriate . 
  insulting other people does n't really help and if you ca n't take downvotes for whatever reason ... than you are wrong in reddit . 
  you are not really into accepting different world views , are n't you ? 
   hrw is not free from biases , especially in that part of the world enough said, 
   hrw is not free from biases , especially in that part of the world and especially when it relies on russian staffers . 
  so i showed you a hrw article which is n't prorussian as you would say . 
   maybe you 're so young that you do n't understand the concept of `` proof '' ? 
  nope , it 's proof that hrw is n't one sided . 
  you are wrong with your assumptions . 
  please try to get a more balanced view . 
  it will help you growing up and find your place in this world . 
  look kiddo , hrw is not really famous for taking a side in conflicts . 
  i try to balance my view on the world and this is what you should do , too . 
  have a nice weekend !, 
  why do i feel like you would totally accept hrw as a reliable source if the article would support your view on the world ? 
  our values are not values for everybody in this world as you can read in the snowden documents or see in the middle east . 
  so you are saying that if russia pays 200k per dead person we are good ? 
  you have to be kidding me . 
  it 's not about the question of guilt or even the dead civilians . 
  this incident is being used to unite europe against russia . 
  where was the public outcry when the iranian airplane got shot down ? 
  when did we unite with iran against the u.s. ? 
  open your eyes and see the hypocrisy . 
  what do you expect from politicians ? 
  even with obvious proof there will be nothing like a public apology . 
  george h. w. bush after a us guided-missile frigate destroyed a iranian airbus :  i will never apologize for the united states -- i do n't care what the facts are ... 
  i 'm not an apologize-for-america kind of guy . '', 
  which translates into :  the united states government `` expressed regret only for the loss of innocent life and did not make a specific apology to the iranian government . '', 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 ) edit : adding more text in order to make my point about politicians clearer, 
  looks like a shiny [ sandcrawler ] ( http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sandcrawler.jpg ), 
  there is a great movie about the problem [ into eternity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/into_eternity_\\ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  you have to communicate with a society 4000 years in the future and tell them to not enter your cave . 
  stop acting like everybody who has n't your opinion is a idiot . 
  i think the risk of fission is not worth the possible outcome of a nuclear disaster . 
  my opinion , i do n't try to convince you !, 
  it was never a money question . 
  germany is densely populated and a evacuation zone of 30 km radius around any nuclear power plant would be a national disaster . 
  we also see regular flooding of rivers here in germany and this could affect a fission reactor . 
  all in all it boils down to the following question : do we control this technology and is it worth the possible outcome of a disaster ? 
  the majority of the german population says no , it is n't . 
  the increase in coal burning is a shame but i prefer it over generating nuclear waste , which our children and their children have to deal with . 
  look , we can just disassemble the wind turbines and the solar panels in case there is a alternative energy source . 
  you ca n't do this with nuclear power plants . 
  i am really proud about our country in this case . 
  it 's not a perfect transition but no industrial state ever tried to get off the fission needle before . 
  this project has to be seen in a 20-40 year context , but people are so narrow minded sometimes and only see the short term outcome . 
  have a great day !, 
  this [ sub ] ( http://antinuclearinfo.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/nuclear-teacher.gif ), 
  i imagine you both wearing traditional 16th century clothing from your region while discussing the big picture . 
  did you read the article ? 
   great britain and the eu are like a couple that make each other unhappy but shy away from doing anything about it .

  the majority is against sanctions and accepts the annexation of crimea .
