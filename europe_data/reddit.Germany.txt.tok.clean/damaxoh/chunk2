  i do n't know what treatment you are getting from homeland security ... 
  can we please get the fingerprints and a digital picture of every us citizen upon entry into the eu ? 
  the people have spoken . 
   `` one of the women helping with the harvest offered to take care of the child and promised : `` you can pick her up her anytime . '', 
  nice move , no ? 
  live long and prosper, 
  i bike there sometimes . 
  it is indeed disgusting to imagine how often one of my text messages was caught there . 
  google is reading my emails too , yes . 
  the problem is that our sense for privacy did n't adapt to the progress in technology . 
  [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ), 
  i wonder how europe would be different today ? 
  we could be at -100 m already !, 
  i found the map on / r/mapporn and thought it is interesting for / r/europe . 
  there was no obvious source but i did some research . 
  here is the eurostat [ source ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/3-26092013-ap/en/3-26092013-ap-en.pdf ) from 2013 with the data from 2011 . 
  i read the article and i still call this guy a nazi . 
  he had many important positions in nazi germany and sent thousands of teenage hj kids into their certain death , when he asked them to defend berlin against the red army . 
  i do n't care about his wife . 
  people like him are the ones who made nazi germany possible . 
  carrying the torch around was the idea of the nazi [ carl diem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_diem ), 
  why is the police not forcing the children into school ? 
  why is the police not stepping in if underage girls are pregnant ? 
  why is the welfare system not setup so integration is paying off ? 
  thank you for your insight . 
  cute ride !, 
  you should give it some personal touch . 
  since this year we are allowed to use battery powered lights ... but only if there is a battery indicator on the light ... german laws ... 
  i can attach lights when it 's dark . 
  a bell is just a excuse to not scream ( talk ) to people . 
  fast commute in a city without hills . 
  bikes are the new cars . 
  i would like to see a limitation on the amount of elections a candidate can participate in . 
  beside that i like our system . 
  how do they justify their claims ? 
  any idea ? 
  he was also controversial in germany . 
  but most importantly he brought literature in germany from some elite circles to the heart of society . 
  it ca n't get worse than black/yellow , can it ? 
  basically doing nothing for 4 years . 
  this is how it works . 
  you vote for the smallest evil possible . 
  i am with you on the iter topic . 
  just wanted to shed some light into the statement against the green party . 
  yes , because of the costs . 
  here is a [ pdf ] ( http://www.gruene-bundestag.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/f-17-89_iter.pdf ) the other reason is the unsolved question of nuclear waste disposal ( yes fusion will generate waste ) . 
  we should keep merkel because the country is in a good economic situation ?

  there is also burak from kreuzberg and nathallia from ukraine . 
  bold statement you make here . 
  but really , you can be a nationalist but please do n't mix socialism and nationalism because this leads to fascism and/or national egoism . 
  i do n't judge , do you ? 
  the lack of nationalism is actually something i really like in my country . 
  no you ca n't do that . 
  this would attract millions of people from the third world . 
  you ca n't do that . 
  people from all over the world would ask for asylum and start working , even if the asylum is not granted in the end ... they would have made a ton of money compared to their home countries . 
  it is important for the politicians . 
  they will mix the conclusion of the un inspectors with some spy agency results , of who did it and present this to the general public as a reason for a attack . 
  for me personally it does n't matter if a person is killed by a bullet , bomb or chemical agent . 
  sorry , but / r/worldnews gives me depressions and a negative view on humanity . 
  ca n't read that . 
  but i am with you on your conclusion . 
  no , i am saying that the investigators can present a cause for the death of the victims . 
  they can also tell from soil probes what happened . 
  they wo n't be able to say if it was assad or the rebels . 
  a criminal investigation takes weeks or months and is n't a thing you can easily pull off in a ongoing civil war . 
  all sides are lying into your face and everybody involved has covered their ass . 
  there is no video of assad pressing the chemical weapon button and the rebels will do anything to provoke a us attack on the syrian dictator . 
  well this is n't some reddit boston marathon bomber investigation . 
  let 's get the nice toys out . 
  we have to see them in action ... 
  yay !!!!, 
  political suicide ... 
  the inspectors are the guys who say what killed the victim but they are not doing the investigation . 
  they are medical specialists and not criminologists . 
  they can say chemical weapon yes/no and that 's it, 
  it 's the same with the danish minority in north germany . 
  the ssw ( south schleswig voter federation ) is excluded from the 5 % rule . 
  globalization . 
  free tibet btw and never forget tiananmen square 1989 !, 
  peace !, 
  imagine the amount of churches romania could build from that money ? 
  [ related ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jviw1/romania_is_building_three_new_churches_a_week/ ), 
  unfortunately most humans ( and politicians ) work like this : money  ideals, 
  there are nazis in [ israel ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israels-nightmare-homegrown-neonazis-in-the-holy-land-396392.html ), 
  google , m$ , facefook and apple leak our information to foreign spy agencies . 
  this should be addressed by making those companies obey national law . 
  you are talking about another issue . 
  china is pretty good in regulating the internet . 
  you ca n't host in china if you do n't have a icp license which requires you to open a business in china . 
  without the icp license you will have trouble addressing chinese customers ( deep packet inspection upon entering the country ) . 
  there are ways to regulate the internet . 
  your idea of the internet is long gone . 
  it is n't a network of freedom anymore but a playing field for commercial ( us ) interests . 
  there is no reason why the nsa should get access to the data of a email that goes between greece and germany . 
  the fdp should become more leutheusser-schnarrenberger and less bruederle . 
  we should build open wifi darknets . 
  german is the real language of love !, 
  i do n't like stereotyping people either .
