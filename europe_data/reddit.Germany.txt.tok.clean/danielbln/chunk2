  he 's apparently not only a lawyer but also a [ biochemist ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/3st5c7/_/cx0u7qp ) . 
  busy fella . 
  i hate what the burqa stands for , and i 'd think we 'd all better off if religion and especially fundamentalist religion would be a thing of the past , but banning a piece of clothing is just political posturing that wo n't do anything but make angry people feel better about themselves . 
  violence , sure , i could imagine that . 
  but you said pogrom , that 's a very specific thing , as i said before , an organized mass ethnic cleansing , a wide-spread massacre . 
  and no , i did n't take offense personally , just trying to let you now that the term means a bit more than you maybe think it does and that i personally do n't think that it would go that far . 
  maybe put the ww2 documentaries down for a second and realize that rising nationalist parties ( while bad ) are still a step or two removed from organized ethnic cleansing/massacre ( = pogrom ) . 
  in berlin they changed it years ago and now you 're only allowed to enter at the front . 
  eye-for-an-eye ? 
  i like to think that we as a society are above that . 
  why do we have to lower ourselves to their standard ? 
  switzerland is tiny and has less than a 10th of the population of germany . 
  i have serious doubts that direct democracy still works well when scaled up to involve 88 million people distributed over a landmass that is 9 times larger . 
  also , if you look at the way the public is whipped into a frenzy during some of your referendums ( e.g. 
  immigration ) and the stark rift between how urban and rural kantons vote , then i 'm not sure i 'd call that `` perfectly fine '' . 
  yes , political corruption is a problem that needs to be tackled , but to be honest , we 're not doing too bad here , check the cpi report : https://www.transparency.org/cpi2015 direct democracy on a federal level comes with severe drawbacks , potentially leading to tyranny of the masses , political fatigue , reducing of complex topics to simple yes/no answers , dependency for policy making on current moods etc. 
  i stand by my statement : direct democracy is awesome on small scale , but quickly becomes bogged down as you scale it up . 
   germany literally invented isds not that it matters , but can you provide a source ? 
   it 's not some newfangled process , been around since the 90s that 's a red herring . 
  yes , isds as a concept has been around , but the process varies depending on parties involved as well as legal basis , and ttip would open the doors for various huge multi-nationals to enter that process where before they were n't necessarily able to . 
   can you point to an isds decision that unfairly favoured companies vattenfall v germany comes to mind , but i 'm sure [ there are other cases ] ( http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/isds ) . 
   one of the fear mongering has actual facts behind it oh come on , while i 'm sure not all arguments brought on by people who are against ttip have merit , you are disqualifying yourself by saying that none of it has actual facts behind it . 
  isds can be a dangerous tool , as it can be used to undermine local state regulations in various sectors ( environmental and customer protection being the two i 'm personally most concerned with ) and a lot of the times , the public ca n't even check all the details of the proceedings , as the they can be hidden from public view under the guise of confidentiality .

  that 's not how realpolitik works . 
  oh please , as if direct democracy is infallible . 
  referendums are usually heavily emotionally charged and people vote based on their hearts , not brains . 
  i think direct democracy is better for local affairs , things that happen on a city/district level , where people can easily get a grasp on what 's happening and something that affects them directly and immediately . 
  here referendums make a lot of sense . 
  on the flip-side , representative democracy works better for higher level politics , state level stuff , things i 'd rather pay a professional to do , as it is complex and hard to grasp . 
  that does n't mean it 's a net positive and it sure as hell does n't mean we should just push it through , sight unseen . 
  personally , i do n't like the idea of isds one single bit , just as an example . 
   it was n't until the late 1980s when bavaria turned from being a net recepient to a net payer . 
  i wish the bavarians would remember that tidbit , seeing how a lot of them always cry about having to pay money to the `` poor north '' . 
  yeah , when i think arctic circle i think reindeers and freezing cold temperatures and odd daylight cycles , not so much innovation . 
  til . 
  according to the wiki article , the detective in charge of the case said that he had doubts from the very beginning that the crime happened as it was described . 
  apparently further investigations into the credibility of the woman did n't happen , as they wanted to avoid an outcry . 
  the detective was not present as a witness during the first trial . 
  pretty wtf all around . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** woman accuses teacher of rape , teacher goes to jail for 5 years ( full sentence , since he would n't participate in group therapy for sexual perpetrators ) . 
  after he was out , in came to light that the woman was a notorious lier and made it all up to get him out of the way for her career . 
  in 2008 a new process started , three years later he was declared innocent . 
  the teacher tried to sue the state to be reimbursed for his wrongful incarcaration , but did n't receive any money until his death . 
  he lived off welfare and died off a heart attack in 2012 . 
  the day of his death , the government started the process against the woman . 
  damn . . 
  who 's that ` he ' you 're talking about ? 
  i 'll just refer you to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4uza6m/germany_waters_down_climate_protection_plan/d5uad3w ) by / u/adlerchen . 
  i was going to type out a reply , but then i checked your post history . 
  keep on keeping on . 
  i do n't think my point is that hard to get . 
  these old reactors had a myriad of incidents over the last years , from cooling systems failure to actual cracks in the reactor walls . 
  they are shoddy and should be shut down . 
  coal plants suck , no question about it , but at the very least they do n't render large portions of land uninhabitable for thousands of years in case of catastrophic failure . 
  and the odds of that happening rise the longer these old-design , sub-optimally maintained reactors stay online . 
  way to contribute to the discussion . 
  hopefully , nuclear fusion will come to fruition by then . 
  nuclear fission is a dead-end technology , time to pump money ( like , massive amounts of money ) into the various nuclear fusion projects instead . 
  those plants were old , like really , really old . 
  a modern , state-of-the-art fission plant is clean and safe , plants from the 70s , less so . 
  not to nitpick , but the movement of enlightement in the west came about in the 17th and 18th century , not `` millenia '' ( = thousands of years ) ago . 
  are we to defend the air with hugs and kisses ? 
  still got ta have a weapon in there somewhere , might as well call it by its name . 
  [ you know you can do this , right ? 
  also , risk for default is priced into credit . 
  rich guy is less likely to default , hence cheaper borrowing . 
  in east germany it 's also often diversity that 's missing . 
  areas that have the least amount of foreigners cry loudest about `` the other '' . 
  while flawed in many ways , i believe in the concept and superiority of the eu and i 'm deeply afraid of misguided and almost negligently misinformed right wing populist movements within the union . 
  therefore i hope that the brexit will trigger needed reforms with the eu , but also that the brexit will be as painful as possible for the uk , economically as well as politically , in order to show the eu electorate that voting angry and isolationist is a detrimental step to take . 
  union first . 
  the blue one with the yellow stars , that is . 
  westeros says : best of luck to the iron islands . 
  we 'll take scotland and nireland of your hands then . 
  good luck to you lot , you 're gon na need it . 
  in addition , the spanish government is n't in a good position to veto much of anything right now . 
  it 's like finding out someone is a scientology member . 
  disappointment with a dash of face palm . 
  yes , let the banter begin !, 
  enjoy your time until the german steel train rolls through the roster . 
  yay , we got our own tea party . 
  i was told to `` eat my f\u00fchrer 's snatch '' . 
  and there it is . 
  i see , so why has n't that happened yet ? 
  why did it require the eu to intervene to actually remove roaming charges ? 
  how 's so ? 
  `` ca n't stand '' = = hate ? 
  mopo is n't dm , but it ai n't exactly the nyt either . 
  yes , that airport and foreigner office really puts a damper on living here ( it does not ) . 
  your criticism is valid , but it has zero impact on people living here , but hey , reisende soll man nicht aufhalten . 
  easy , normally you put a central entity in charge of such a project , which then sources all the other companies required for construction . 
  this central entity takes their cut of course , but is also liable for timely construction . 
  in a moment of retardation , the berlin government at the time sought to do the central management themselves , and well , here we are . 
  weeeell , maybe rush it some more if you 're going to the south , english proficiency is n't amazing there . 
  are you saying some one who writes stuff like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/625lqu/german_msm_are_now_brainwashing_its_citizens_into/dfjwtmx/ ) :  you do n't think merkel is a radical leader ? 
  only thing missing is left wing death camps , which i 'm sure will come , in time . 
  as for her migration and social policies she 's completely radical and genocidal . 
  would n't be up for providing proper sources ? 
  i ca n't even fathom that !,
