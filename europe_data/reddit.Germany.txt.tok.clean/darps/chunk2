  did ? 
  bipolar ? 
  in scandinavia , there 's nothing to do other than watching porn all day . 
  southern europe is still puzzled at what this sorcery is in the first place . 
  i hate it when motorways bridge . 
  we need one with a cinema attached . 
  imagine flying at night with a glass floor . 
  i 'm sure they had their reasons . 
  perhaps it was simply too unsafe . 
  unlike some other gigantic industry equipment ( e.g. 
  plane parts ) , this one is pretty unique . 
   just because the german government in particular is given authority to crack down on freedom of expression does not mean that it can do so morally . 
  thought experiment : i 'd like to express myself by burning down your house . 
  where 's the issue ? 
  oh , maybe you mean your right to inviolability of your home and the right to property . 
  i guess that limits my freedom of expression . 
  a less extreme example : what would you think of a party that advocates taking the right to vote or the freedom of assembly away from * any * group of people ? 
  is n't that within their freedom of expression ? 
  stop acting like because something is a right it 's a carte blance to do whatever you want . 
  your rights are n't being cracked down on ; they simply end where others ' rights begin . 
  no opinion is illegal , but it 's unlawful to pursue an ideology politically that goes against the free democratic order , i.e. 
  destroying democracy from within . 
  at that point , it 's not just an opinion ( which is protected by the right to freedom of expression ) , but a political agenda . 
  since we 're talking about germany here , let me provide some background information on our constitution :  ** article 2 : **  ( 1 ) every person shall have the right to free development of his personality insofar as he does not violate the rights of others or offend against the constitutional order or the moral law . 
   ** article 18 : **  whoever abuses the freedom of expression , in particular the freedom of the press ( paragraph ( 1 ) of article 5 ) , the freedom of teaching ( paragraph ( 3 ) of article 5 ) , the freedom of assembly ( article 8 ) , the freedom of association ( article 9 ) , the privacy of correspondence , posts and telecommunications ( article 10 ) , the rights of property ( article 14 ) , or the right of asylum ( article 16a ) in order to combat the free democratic basic order shall forfeit these basic rights . 
  this forfeiture and its extent shall be declared by the federal constitutional court . 
  source : [ basic law of the federal republic of germany ] ( https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf ) it 's pretty simple actually . 
  freedom of expression does not extend to limiting others ' freedom of expression . 
  you ca n't infringe on someone else 's fundamental rights and chalk it up to personal freedom . 
  the federal republic of germany is inherently and unchangeably democratic . 
  and i 'm okay with that . 
  i agree with the ban . 
  the nazis were more than just a political party . 
  those symbols are not banned because they represent a different * political * point of view , but because they stand for honouring a mass-murdering madman and his plan for global war and genocide . 
  it 's not only incredibly insensitive and a slap in the faces of the victims and their descendants , but also implies that it 's a legit political movement . 
  there are limits to freedom of expression , which is essential to a democratic state ; for example , ideologies that go fundamentally against the idea of a democracy . 
  there are exceptions to the rule , at least in germany . 
  if it 's done in a historical/educational or satirical fashion , or coming from a different background entirely ( e.g. 
  jainism , hinduism , nordic traditions etc. 
  ) , it 's perfectly fine . 
  i agree with the ban in general though .

  it 's not owed to the country , duh . 
  it 's owed to the banks . 
  unless you 'd start disowning your banks , you 're stuck with that debt . 
  wow , and that from a country that imports thousands of our cars each year . 
  haha, 
  danzig/gdansk is an interesting case as well . 
  geographically i 'm 1/8 polish . 
  yes , the holocaust is thoroughly covered in german history classes ( we spent about 4 years learning about it altogether ) , i 've been to 5 concentration and forced labor camps and several memorial sites . 
  i do not and will not ever attempt to make excuses for those crimes that were committed . 
  it would be a tragedy if people would forget what happened , because that creates a chance that they make the same mistake again . 
  but ca n't you see how it does nothing for either side if you see today 's germany and its 80 million inhabitants as nothing but descendants of nazis ? 
  are n't you aware that the vast majority of civilians had no part in the mass killings ( which does not excuse the general persecution and alienation ) ? 
  that there were many families risking their lives in support of jewish friends and partners ? 
  that there was n't a single democratic election , despite hitler 's and goebbel 's propaganda , even long before the deportations started , where a majority of germans voted for the nsdap ? 
  that around 77 000 non-jewish german citizens were killed for opposing the ndsap 's agenda of racism and hate ? 
  even if you 're eager to forget all of that and regard 1933 's germany as nation of 98,96 % nazis , it 's simply ignorant to claim their grandchildren should feel personally guilty . 
  it seems kind of inappropriate to act like germany is a nation of war profiteers . 
  the jewish population was ( and to a lesser degree still is ) an essential part of germany . 
  my grandfather on my father 's side was drafted into the wehrmacht in 1941 and shot in the head in russia ( he was lucky to survive and sent back home , otherwise he would 've died like the vast majority of wehrmacht soldiers fighting in russia ) . 
  my father had cut contact to his parents ( and i supported that decision ) because they had denied that his father voted for the nsdap during the last `` democratic '' elections . 
  on my mother 's side , my grandmother 's family in danzig/gdansk was murdered by ns soldiers because they were friends with a jewish family and hid them when the deportations started . 
  it 's not like the average german had a marvelous pastime happily murdering jews in his backyard . 
   they should be ashamed and guilty until the end of their time as a nation , not 2014 but in 3014 they should still remember and feel sorry for what they did as the collective known as germans . 
  remember and feel sorry ? 
  definitely . 
  accept personal responsibility for crimes they did n't commit ? 
  unrealistic . 
  you inherit neither the good nor the bad deeds of your parents . 
  there are not many countries in the world that would put so much effort into recovering and reviewing evidence , educating their younger generations , building memorials , and trying to repay the debt generations later . 
  i thing about 70 years and two generations should do the job . 
   forgiven or forgotten huge difference there , pal . 
  do n't act like anyone wanted you to forget . 
  being unable to forgive however is essentially holding onto a grudge against a nation two generations later , which is holding you back more than us . 
  germany 's diplomatic relations with the us , france and uk ( for example ) are based on mutual respect and trade , which is economically and culturally beneficial for both sides . 
  germany 's diplomatic relations with israel is based on holocaust guilt , nothing else . 
  are you really happy with that ? 
  i 'm well-aware of zensursula 's archievements  the biggest being her hairdo . 
  must be made of titanium or so, 
  she definitely looks nicer than ours ( v.d. 
  leyen ) , and she 'll have to do really well to surpass her in terms of incompetence and uninformed actionism . 
  you forgot to mention our minister 's hairdo ( germany , far right ) . 
  former minister of family affairs , has seven children . 
  head of the military now , i 'm looking forward to see her on the front line . 
  i 'm neither gay nor about to get married , and i still care about that kinda thing . 
  empathy sucks like that . 
  54 dead is a calm afternoon in chicago . 
  american standards . 
  calling us hypocrites because we are n't superheroes and not able to make good on every promise our government made is kind of a dick move . 
  if i may say this : at least we * fucking try . 
  * most nations on earth ca n't be bothered to give a damn about refugees , and most nations do n't have to deal with such a heavy influx , and most nations did n't have an open border policy in the first place . 
  450 000 refugees have found their way into germany in 2015 . 
  ( that 's already 150 000 more than what was estimated for all of 2015 . ), 
  for comparison : the entire city of stuttgart , capital of the state of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , has 600 000 citizens . 
  every one needs access to food , water , shelter , healthcare , education etc. 
  billions of investments .
