i did n't know that kaliningrad was part of germany again . 
  til . 
  for example bavaria . 
  germany 's parliament looks like it hosts exactly 420 mps . 
  and here i thought west-berlin was in northern ireland . 
  the goal is to get home asap . 
  ah , sorry dude . 
  you 'll always have ' 88 . 
  and maybe you 'll have some success in ~ ~ france ~ ~ russia . 
  world cups 0 . 
  * unsinkable ii *, 
  would 've been better to include the description in the map . 
  also uk and ireland . 
  weirdest one : norway , finland , and two of three baltic states . 
  cool !, 
  so you know kieran ? 
  do n't worry , mate . 
  you still can go to any eu country and open yet another irish pub . 
  i also could need a bail out . 
  fun fact : when people in germany talk about `` db '' , they mean * deutsche bahn * , the german railway company . 
  i think in everyday speech `` england '' is used more often for the uk . 
  again . 
   `` sextember '' would be probably `` sextil '' , which also sounds nice . 
  i 'm still struggling to popularise `` moin '' in freiburg . 
  `` wodanstag '' might be easier . 
  reminds me of september , october , november , and december . 
  this `` midweek '' crap is just silly . 
  we should revert to wodanstag . 
   and i thought stalin , brezhnev , ceau\u0219escu , honecker , mao , kim il-sung etc. 
  were dictators !, 
  this schuler guy must be a real bad boy . 
  knife ? 
  reminds me of this old german pun by knorkator : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wamp1ihm3ds, 
  will probably be an afd-cdu-linke coalition . 
  also kaliningrad . 
  but only if austria becomes officially * ausztria * . 
   that would only amount for one metal that 's heavy !, 
  mecklenburg-vorpommern and bremen could also need some additional holidays , as those are a scarce commodity in northern germany . 
   while the gold first ranking system has been used occasionally by some american media outlets , newspapers in the united states primarily publish medal tables ordered by the total number of medals won . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olympic_medal_table#ranking_systems blame ~ ~ canada ~ ~ the us newspapers !, 
  kaya yanar about dutch : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjiq4rli89a it 's in german , but you may get the gist . 
  eliminating england was also nice . 
  people always mix up norway and liechtenstein . 
  malta 's english is better anyway . 
  eurovision last , euros first . 
  sounds like a good deal . 
  it was a two-round 12-point system , but the second round was cut short in presentation . 
  in the background on german tv ? 
  [ relevant scandinavia and the world . 
  ] ( http://satwcomic.com/geography-joke ), 
  nah , the three musketeers fought against the swiss . 
  here 's a documentary : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmhq4lslfsq, 
   mir w\u00eblle bleiwe wat mir sinn reminds me of this classic : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mr9erzjndo, 
  `` ich verwarne ihnen '' `` ich danke sie ''  lippens was known for his imaginative footwork , which earned him the nickname ente ( duck ) , and was a fan favorite because of his irreverent good humour . 
  one particular anecdote about lippens has become a clich\u00e9 in german football culture : a referee once gave lippens a yellow card , saying : ich verwarne ihnen !, 
  ( `` i 'm warning you !, 
  '' ) , in defective german grammar , using a dative pronoun instead of accusative . 
  ( `` sir , i thank you !, 
  '' ) , sarcastically using an accusative pronoun instead of a correct dative this time . 
  lippens was immediately sent off by the referee . 
  beautiful , but shitty for old and handicapped people . 
  just shows that he 's a native speaker . 
  they make those mistakes all the time , similar to the german mistakes seid/seit and das/dass . 
  what about a hotel that does n't accept swedes ? 
  the news everybody was waiting for . 
  of course he 's not really fluent in italian as he does n't use his hands . 
  anyone got an animated gif of it ? 
  so all the nazi comments were n't insults , but compliments !? 
  dude in the picture also wears shoes . 
  5 % or three ( out of 299 ) direct mandates . 
   the pds won four constituency seats in its power base of the former east berlin , qualifying it for proportional representation seats even though the party failed to cross the 5 % electoral threshold . 
  under a longstanding electoral law intended to benefit regional parties , any party that won at least three constituency seats was entitled to its share of proportionally-elected seats regardless of vote share . 
  well , he 's right about mallorca . 
  berlin = hungary ? 
  t_d will be so disappointed . 
  thanks !, 
  i do n't want to wear anything . 
  may i ? 
  not even 0.1 !? 
  weirdo !, 
  he 's some aristocratic snob . 
  coincidentally , for me , the consortium will always be ric flair . 
  one could say europe is ( \u2022 _ \u2022 ) ( \u2022 _ \u2022 )  \u2310 \u25a0 - \u25a0 tits ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) yyyyyyeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh, 
  as long as it 's not about hockey . 
  kein cape !, 
  ~ ~ luxembourg would be closer to dr congo than congo . ~ ~ edit : wikipedia says that `` congo '' is used for dr congo ... alright , folks , move on . 
  nothing to see here . 
  furthermore , if a party wins three direct seats , they get their share of seats , even when under 5 % . 
  west is best !, 
  also here . 
  d\u00fcssel is a river , dussel is a goof . 
  aka the queen of . tv, 
  queen of australia . 
  but speaking of augsburg : today is their unique holiday . 
  all of germany has to work today , except for the city of augsburg . 
  ( the surrounding district of augsburg has to work ), 
  never bring a sword to a gun fight . 
  nice to see the dutch finally having a good team for russia 2018 . 
   at the advice to agree to build more brothels [ in vienna ] , the emperor [ joseph ii . ], 
  is alleged to have responded : `` what , brothels ?
