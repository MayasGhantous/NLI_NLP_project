poking to test reaction times and the reactions itself . 
  just like this http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/19/us/russian-plane-incidents/ or this http://defense-update.com/20140424_natos-quick-reaction-force-scrambled-follow-russian-bombers-north-sea.html . 
  russia sends some planes every now and then to test what happens . 
  these are the [ sorbs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbs ), 
  with less flags this map would be pointless . 
  the three german ones are : on the left : baden-w\u00fcrttemberg top right : [ franconia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franconia ) lower right : bavaria, 
  i 'm surprised too . 
  especially both together . 
  but together ? 
  no way . 
  in german they are called regenw\u00fcrmer ( rain worms ), 
  jokes about german tv and media . 
  especially a show called galileo . 
  it was a very popular show with short documentaries about all kinds of science , nature , tech and so on . 
  now it is full of [ chicks going down water slides ] ( http://youtu.be/ax564qgcpm0?t=1m39s ) and a [ fat guy eating a lot of shit ] ( http://youtu.be/nhq4geqgx6s?t=9m38s ) .

  here is a panorama of [ my view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ol3dbs2.jpg ) and on the [ other side ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hprtaar.jpg ) . 
  a small town with a population of ~ 2000 in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , germany . 
  these hohenzollern guys got a pretty impressive castle . 
  mongolia , it 's your time to shine . 
  i think its not state owned but state controlled into an administration union that is not profit orientated . 
  but they still managed to do a stupid cross-border-leasing deal in 2002 for over 800million $ that should last for 30 years but was canceled in 2009 with a overall loss of 5million $ . 
  1000l or a m ^ 3 costs 1,82 $ . 
  nope , i 'm from stuttgart . 
  volkswagen just increased the population from under 1000 to ~ 25.000 to the end of ww2 . 
  wolfsburg was mentioned the first time in 1302 . 
  the `` newest '' cities/villages were refounded because of brown coal strip mining, 
  guttenberg without the plagiarism would be her biggest rival . 
  yay , protest tourists . 
  they are absolutely everywhere . 
  the bigger the topic is they `` protest '' the more come . 
  and from what i learned here in germany , the do n't really care what they protest , as long as there is enough police and tv cameras . 
  so , who will be the last country to get at least one point ? 
  ha , take that / r/danmag, 
  and maybe without austria too . 
  their food and feelings, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk6xachv6ps something like this i 'd say, 
  someone will open a shop nearby and sell ladders long enough to get over . 
  because the government probably does not have to pay for those schools . 
  i kinda like italian . 
  no , that probably would be egg creme . 
  and germany . 
  except that eurosport just got the broadcasting rights for the olympic games 2018 and 2024 so they might grow a bit next year . 
  got some of these friends as well . 
  most of them shared an `` article '' that basically said france is on fire and there are massive riots in over 30 cities . 
  but it 's bullshit , this comes up as soon as there is any bigger protest in france and they use the same old pictures every time . 
  whenever any `` news site '' rants about `` government controlled tv news '' i do n't even bother reading more then the headline since its 99,99 % exaggerated bullshit or just completely made up . 
  most of the stuff written there is common sense like do n't camp on highway rest stops . 
  some stuff about increased security checks on airports . 
  what type of badge you need to drive in the center of paris and stuff like that . 
  especially the overseas territories have a huge part with recommended vaccinations . 
  does n't matter who it is or what they did . 
  the death sentence is barbaric . 
  we abolished the `` eye for an eye '' system long time ago . 
  you ca n't bring dead people back and i doubt the victim ( s ) have it any better after the execution . 
  as long as it is not possible to make mistakes and get the wrong person there always is a chance that you got an innocent one on the death list . 
  and for me that 's even worse . 
  just a couple days ago a guy in my state was awarded 500k $ for a couple years he spent innocent in prison . 
  it 's the same with freedoms and terror . 
  i rather accept the fact that someone could build a bomb or drive a truck into people then to live unter total surveillance . 
  because of we give up our freedom to stop a potentional terrorist we did n't win anything . 
  kik in germany, 
  heilbronn is a shit hole too . 
  bombed to rubble and rebuild as concrete blocks . 
  my grandma had one , but since then i have n't seen one anywhere else . 
  even at the most religious people i know and they pray before every meal . 
  ~ ~ france ~ ~ belgium : [ plastic bertrand - ca plane pour moi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v98heqvtpgo ), 
  [ swabian ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/swabian_german ) which is a kind of allemanic dialect . 
  we tend to end substantives with an * le * which is also a way to call something small . 
  the dialect also burrows some words from the french like : french : trottoir swabian : troddwar german : gehweg more are here : http://www.dampfwalze.eu/?q=node/23, 
  i do n't have to , but i want to get up early . 
  the earlier i get in my car the less traffic i have to sit trough . 
  i have to drive into the traffic capital of germany . 
  this means my usual 45min-1 hour commute can easily turn in 2 hours of stop and go the later i leave . 
  there are many more fractions . 
  the syrian government the is the kurds the fsa and a couple more smaller rebell groups i kinda hope that the kurds win but just because they are the least evil group there . 
  if i have to say who is more likely to win , it 's assad . 
  as long as russia is massively supporting him . 
  not really a morning person but my usual commute is about an hour ( one way ) and i like to go home before 16:00 so i have some time left to shop or do stuff . 
  usually a brezel , nothing special . 
  every now and then something sweet . 
  the same as on any workday . 
  stand up at 5:45 , shower , go to the bakery to get someting to eat for breakfast , go to work , have breakfast . 
  if that 's how you can get italian citizenship , then so it is . 
  but most of all , i do n't care . 
  i hope they stay in . 
  i do n't think people like boris johnson realize what happens if the uk leaves the european single market . 
  it 's all about immigration here and immigration there . 
  all major and even most regional news outlets report about the primaries so we are kinda forced to watch . 
  / r/german not / r/germany, 
  what is the australian media saying ? 
  that europe is now a war zone ? 
  because of paris there is a bit more police and stuff around in public places but besides that nothing changed . 
  at least nothing that would be a reason to be afraid . 
  go on your trip , have a blast , you are save . 
  do you speak a south european language ? 
  the 500 $ note is not that uncommon . 
  a lot of people buy even expensive stuff with cash . 
  cars , tvs , furniture and so on .
