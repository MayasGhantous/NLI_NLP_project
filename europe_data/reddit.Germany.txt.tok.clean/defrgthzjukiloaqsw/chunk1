that should n't surprise you . 
  [ german civil code from 1896 still valid ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/index.html ) . 
  there are many like it . 
   or , simply , it had n't been made a law yet . 
  labelling something as `` x '' while it is `` y '' and looks exactly the same as `` x '' is ** fraud ** . 
  or did you guys actually made a special law saying `` no selling of yellow shiny metal as gold if it does not contain the percentage of gold advertised '' ? 
  you must have lots of time . 
   germany even has its own version of the fda to fulfill the same roll of testing and regulating food/drug substances . 
  it 's own version ... you make it sound like we copied it . 
  the existense of an institute for risk assessement does n't prove anyones point . 
   kinda shocking to hear that you completely do n't understand how the legal system of western democracies work . 
  oh dear , you found a mirror . 
  it 's also become clear that you actively refuse to read anything i wrote . 
  to sausage ? 
  milk ? 
  does not compute . 
   what i 'm trying to tell you is that without a legal framework to describe ` putting non-food product in a thing labelled food ' as fraud there is no way to prosecute someone for doing it . 
  what i 'm trying to tell you is that is wrong . 
  seriously , do you read anything i write ? 
   seriously , prior to the introduction of these laws it was not legally considered fraud to make a breadloaf entirely out of sawdust , call it bread , and try to get people to buy it . 
  well then obviously your legal system fucked up . 
   who decides what bread means in a reasonable context without a reasonable set of laws laying out how to describe things ? 
  in germany we call that `` verkehrsanschauung '' . 
  it means that a $ product is supposed to be like the vast majority of objective third parties expect it to be . 
   more so , who 's to say a company calling their product ` bread ' but making it with sawdust is actually illegal ? 
  it 's fraud . 
   there 's no fraud if they do n't openly lie about the contents of the bread . 
  but they did . 
   more so , who makes them put labels on the bread with the contents ? 
  how could a poor man on the street know that his bread has saw dust or his fish has mercury in it without oversight from a competent inspection organization ? 
  why would n't you have oversight ? 
   without laws setting up the institutions that define how we interact as consumers with businesses and , more so , utilizing the power of our government to provide experts to defend us from those who would take advantage of us . 
  that 's the nature of why these laws are necessary in many fields of human endeavor . 
  you 'll realize i never said that there should be no oversight , i said that no special law was needed to prosecute fraud . 
  well , that 's better then . 
  true , should still not be in a package that says `` cheese '' . 
   because , at the time , it was n't regulated what people put in ` food ' and what people called ` food ' . 
  huh ? 
  if i sell you `` bread '' that contains `` not bread stuff '' that 's fraud . 
  plain and simple . 
   the defense was , if people did n't like the products of a company , then the consumer would drive that company out of business by not buying their product . 
  that 's how , in a pure capitalist economy , business ethics is enforced . 
  and it does n't work . 
   and laws like this one were central to ensuring that the government could regulate the contents of products labeled as food . 
  actually no , courts should just have told people to cut their bullshit . 
  like we did . 
  or , if you insist , make a law listing allowed ingredients in `` bread '' . 
  as a german i do n't understand how milk gets into sausage . 
   and germany did and decided that the law should be removed ... only the special law for insulting foreign heads of state of course , the normal insulting law will stay . 
   because there 's no reason to change it ? 
  it still serves the useful purpose ( complete with 100 years of case law and president precedent ) of keeping non-food out of food . 
  and yet you have wood pulp in grated cheese . 
  but that 's a good one . 
  you can sell all the `` craft '' brews you want . 
  just do n't call them `` beer '' , because they 're not . 
  well , the revenue would have to come from somewhere else so in the end nothing would be gained by repealing the schaumweinsteuer . 
   all countries have ancient laws that do n't get changed as either a ) they still work or b ) not worth the hassle as its useless . 
  pretty sure that 's mostly common law countries . 
   yes of course . 
  but when the law was passed ( back in the 1930s ) people were literally doing that , and the poor starving people in this country were hoodwinked repeatedly by people selling non-food products inside ` food ' . 
  so why were n't those people prosecuted for fraud ? 
  so will you be starting to pay your un dues then ? 
  we should just change the target to 1 % . 
   do you understand what a statement this broad would lead to ? 
  any website in the eu would just ask you , `` we do n't know what we 're allowed to do without permission anymore , so by visiting this site you agree that we can run any scripts in your browser , check any information that your browser normally provides and set cookies . 
  click continue to proceed . '', 
  that 's not a valid consent . 
   of course , everyone who has the option would n't host in the eu . 
  it 's also irrelevant where it 's hosted . 
  tryign to weasel ones way around regulations is a very american thing to do , it 's also extremely annoying . 
   it 's a questionable justification . 
  they do not necessarily probe for specific plugins ( in fact , the browser and the plugin should not let them do so ) , they just check if their ads are being displayed . 
  and that 's illegal . 
  that they check * anything * on my computer without my consent . 
  are ads a common thing during eurovision in countries that are not germany , uk , denmark , sweden ? 
   televoting money nobody besides the phone company makes money of that in germany . 
   a regular participant earns a bunch of money from it every year . 
  how ? 
  i like you . 
  guys , romania got excluded from the ** european broadcasting union ** because it did n't pay it 's membership fees for years . 
  the song contest is just a small thing the ebu does . 
  does tvr really show ads ? 
  seems weird . 
  meh , netflix is about the same as two movie rentals so still very much a bargain . 
  mediahint still working fine , no idea what 's going on here . 
   where 's the logic in that ? 
  you are in denmark , there is your logic . 
   but it seems overly punitive to fine a company that did n't break the law . 
  that 's not possible , so it 's not what 's happening . 
  is n't it everywhere ? 
   also , can you please show me what taxes are levied against european refineries so i can make a direct comparison ? 
  in germany every litre sold to consumers is taxed about $ 0.85 . 
  if op were living in the usa he would n't be rich either . 
   he 's pretty much an upper class , his net worth appears to be about ... $ 50k maybe ? 
  reddit needs to calm down . 
  at least he put tuna on it . 
  and then get scared at 35 because they wanted children . 
  i 'm guessing it was what wikipedia calls ersttrimesterscreening . 
  anyhow , pregnancy was completed with a healthy boy . 
  no , this was a ~ $ 100 blood test .
