   it was your own people that formed the country i live in today , funnily enough . 
  my people formed england ? 
  you mean the angles or the saxons ? 
   i ca n't understand a scottish person speaking scots or scottish gaelic . 
  so at least it puts us on the same page there . 
  although , obviously , all scottish people speak english , as i bet bavarians know standard german . 
  see , it 's pretty much the same . 
  bavarians have weird customs and so do scots . 
  yes , gaelic is an actual language and bavarian is `` only '' a dialect , but its * nearly * the same situation . 
  and we do actually call bavaria `` a state '' and they do actually have quite a lot of sovereignty that the federal government can not do anything about without changing our constitution . 
  exactly . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
   they 're not considered different countries today , though . 
  that 's my point , yes . 
   england is classified , officially , as a country . 
  so are the rest of the countries in the uk . 
  yeah , but only to appease the locals . 
   also , there are way more ethnic , cultural and linguistic differences historically between scotland and england , for example , than prussia and bavaria . 
  well , i certainly can not understand a bavarian speaking bavarian . 
  there will be no more single market for the uk . 
  that 's a fact you have to accept . 
  there wo n't even be a discussion if single market access can be had without free movement . 
  at any price . 
   they would need a new currency technically the scottish pound still exists , in actual bills even . 
   they would also be taking on a share of uk debt no , no they would n't . 
  that 's uk debt , not scotland debt . 
  germany and the usa are made up of countries if the uk is made up of countries . 
  so you 're saying the uk is a state consisting of different sovereign nations because those different nations actually do n't have any sovereignty whatsoever ? 
  and ? 
  bavaria * used * to be a different country than prussia only 98 ( 145 depending on your point of view ) years ago . 
  it 's the same thing as in the uk . 
  you could pretty much say the same about germany . 
  the brits are just exaggerating . 
  fixed amounts for heating are illegal in germany . 
  lots of places in germany switch off central heating when it 's warm enough outside . 
  warm water is either made separately or with electricity . 
  americans . 
  it 's a real custom . 
  cheap rum and other spirits . 
  so ... yeah ? 
  we give our friends a normal sweep . 
  but then we litter damp confetti and rice in front of them . 
  and you are only released if you manage to kiss a virgin . 
  at least that 's the custom in my area of germany . 
  in germany you 're made to sweep the town halls door steps if you 're unmarried at 30 . 
  it does n't mention to what level . 
  no company anywhere could benefit from that . 
   this is absolutely correct . 
  no , it is a 100 % lie . 
  there is no talk of ** any ** kind of tesla competitor in the article . 
   the article headline , `` austrian brothers seek to pass tesla with souped-up car '' , is also correct . 
  an austrian company made by 3 brothers are in the process of creating better version of cars that could pass tesla . 
  also a lie , that company ** does n't even make cars ** . 
  for fucks sake , he ** did n't ** do that !, 
  using those supposedly free patents allows tesla free use of all patents of any company that does so . 
  you even linked to that !, 
  why did n't you read the articles you linked ?!, 
   tesla 's definition of `` acting in good faith '' depends solely on three things a party wanting to use tesla 's patents for free ** can not do ** :  ** asserted , helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of ( i ) any patent or other intellectual property right against tesla ** or ( ii ) any patent right against a third-party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment ;, 
  you missed the point , being that teslas `` offer '' is so obviously only made for marketing because it 's ridiculous . 
  that makes tesla a scumbag for lying . 
  agreeing to that stipulation is ** payment ** . 
  that stipulations would cost tesla a shit-ton of money . 
  batteries are commodities . 
  dozens of companies all over the world make them , nothing special about that . 
   edit : oh and they even have a home energy storage system so the same kind of product tesla also sells literally dozens of companies selling home energy storage systems all over the world ** for decades ** . 
   weird hipster-but-broke-as-shit-bubble . 
  confirmed . 
  the headline is a 100 % lie . 
   well , i see a lot of them . 
  you 're kidding , trolling or are living in some weird hipster-but-broke-as-shit-bubble . 
  apparently they did n't do a good job then . 
  tesla will be bankrupt before that thing opens . 
  it 's not fair . 
  if mercedes would use their patents then tesla could use ** any and all ** mercedes patents for free . 
  thank you , at least one other person on reddit gets this . 
  they are not free . 
  anyone using them agrees to not sue tesla for anything ever , including use of ones own patents by tesla . 
   these are amazing news . 
  this is what elon musk wanted all along hence why he made his patents opensource free to use . 
  he did n't do that . 
  they are ** very ** expensive to use and nobody in the world actually uses them for that reason . 
   they are direct competitor between tesla powerwall/kreisel mavero though . 
  as are dozens of companies which made batteries for decades . 
  clickbait works , yay . 
  i 'm sorry , do you see hundreds of people using oneplus ' every day ? 
  yeah , did n't think so . 
  they do n't even make cars , they do n't compete with tesla . 
  it was n't . 
  what 's morally wrong about saying `` tell us what you 're upto or we 'll leave now '' ? 
  if you put the word `` threaten '' in it that does n't change anything , it 's a threat with or without the word . 
  dumbest thing i read all day , congratulations . 
  you 're saying they were trying to convey that they believe the banks are morally wrong by `` threatening '' ? 
  interesting , i honestly never would have got that . 
  i believe they do , yes . 
  the women we are talking about also knew before of course . 
   no , they do n't . 
  fundamentalist families do n't let their women go out , she 's wearing a headscarf . 
  that 's fundamentlist enough . 
   get a degree , this one did n't have one anyway . 
   you do n't have to deal with that stuff ?
