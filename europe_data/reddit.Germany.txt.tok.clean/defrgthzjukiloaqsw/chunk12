  they did . 
  ** that 's what this whole fucking thread is about ** . 
   they paid every last tax that was owed . 
  they did not . 
   they broke no laws weeell , not exactly , no . 
   and evaded zero taxes . 
  evasion is a crime , so let 's say they did not evade . 
   you can only pay the bills that are given to you . 
  and sometimes these bills come ten years late . 
   why is ireland not punished ? 
  nobody is punished . 
   except no such thing exists anywhere else . 
  name any other situation where a government punishes a company or individual for following the laws of their governments . 
  but apple ** did not follow the law ** . 
  that 's the whole fucking point . 
  and it 's not getting punished in any way . 
   it 's the fact that apple is being punished it 's not punished in any way . 
   you can scare away american investors which ones ? 
  where would they go ? 
  if they did n't * have * to be in the eu they would n't * be * here now . 
   our economy is heavily reliant on mncs so we do n't want 13 billion euros . 
  so you want no money because you want money ? 
  insane , literally insane . 
   apple paid $ 400m in taxes to the irish govt the year i have a feeling apple is counting taxes other than income tax in that statement . 
  you have any citation ont he matter ? 
   because how could a company think a government was doing something illegal ? 
  by reading the law . 
  it 's not difficult . 
   it was following national laws and did nothing wrong . 
  ** no ** , it was n't . 
  they were and they are . 
  and ireland * has * to demand that money back from apple . 
  the eu just told ireland they have to do that , they do n't deal with apple . 
  or , weird idea i know , companies could just pay what they owe at all times . 
  then they would n't be surprised ten years later . 
  apple * knew * what they did was illegal . 
   then the eu should take that up with ireland . 
  ** it does ** . 
   if a sovereign nation said it was legal then it was . 
  where is the resolution by the irish parliament granting apple illegal subsidies ? 
  there is none ? 
  i see . 
  well , then you should read the fucking contracts ireland signed that say `` we wo n't grant subsidies . 
  apples subsidies were illegal at the time apple received them . 
  otherwise ireland would n't be able to demand them now . 
   the chilling effect it could have on international investment into the eu . 
  ridiculous , absolutely ridiculous . 
  what the fucking hell . 
  angie has gone ( even more ) full retard . 
   with most people still using dsl . 
  as long as i get 100mbps i do n't fucking care that i 'm using dsl . 
  yeah , that wo n't fly . 
  the question would be : why ? 
  you 'd have to show damages . 
  what would be the damages here ? 
  how would it not ? 
  let hungary do what they are supposed to do : close and control the eu border . 
  problem solved . 
   how would this have solved the situation it would have prevented a million refugees coming to the eu . 
  problem solved . 
  not sure if you replied to the correct comment . 
  you 're conflating heads of government with heads of state . 
  they are the most impartial persons in the country . 
  btw : constitutional court judges are elected to a single twelve-year term that may end prematurely if the judge reaches age 68 . 
  half are elected by parliament and the other half by the senate . 
  there are 16 judges in two equal senates of eight . 
   while simultaneously finding a solution to the flow of migrants into the eu the solution would have been a fence at the hungarian border . 
  which hungary is required to build by eu contracts actually . 
   which of her choices are irrational ? 
  the choice was to let people travel on to germany because the conditions in hungary and greece were unbearable . 
  that would be the first irrational choice . 
  it 's quite obvious . 
   but that 's what you do in a emergency , there was no emergency . 
   those people are running from a war back in ` ye olde days people actually defended their home country . 
  because it 's the most idiotic decision ever . 
  and now * i * have to pay for this bullshit . 
  if she just wanted to help she would have paid for camps in turkey . 
  or greece or whereever . 
  you have to let a couple hundred drown to save hundreds of thousands . 
  or at least drop them off where they came from immediately after rescuing them . 
   i do n't see anyone else handling the migrants crisis better . 
  literally anyone else . 
  by do n't objecting to hungary building a fence , which hungary is actually required to do by the eu contracts . 
  instead merkel flooded * our * ( yes , yours too ) countries with refugees . 
  it was her pet project , she should at least be able to organize it . 
  or do n't do it . 
   term limits exist so that a country can pat itself on the back about everyone being given a fair chance at being in power , not having dodgy political dynasties , since 1989 ( 28 years ) the usa had 12 years of bush presidents , eight years of clinton and is in the process of electing another clinton for at least four more years . 
  but still no term limit , so the point is not moot . 
  actually no . 
  each state would be making its own decision on the matter . 
  actually each state * did * make its own decision on this and none limits the number of terms . 
  seehofer , no one else left . 
  that 's not left-liberalism . 
  dude . 
  if the majority wanted gay marriage we would ** have ** gay marriage because parliament would have passed it . 
  this is quite obvious . 
   before it got struck down by merkel . 
  who kind of represents the majority . 
   there is of course the fact that people in germany tend to be very lazy about their politics , but that 's another matter . 
  well , yeah .
