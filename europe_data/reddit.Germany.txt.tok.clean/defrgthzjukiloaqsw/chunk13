  that 's a `` are you against gay marriage '' - poll in which 74 % said `` no '' . 
  so what ? 
  there is no `` movement '' so to speak to let them marry . 
  if the people * wanted * this they would get it . 
   speak for yourself , most germans actually accept equal marriage i did n't speak for myself . 
  i explained to him that we would have it ** if ** we wanted it . 
  but apparently no one cares . 
  you also do n't understand the difference between `` accepting something '' and `` wanting something '' . 
  it 's a non-issue . 
   what 's the downside of having marriage equality ? 
  they 'd be able to marry of course . 
   do n't you want people to have equal rights ? 
  why would ** i ** * want * that ? 
  i do n't care either way actually . 
  but in the grand scheme of things i certainly do n't want equal rights for everyone . 
  i want laws to benefit * me * mostly . 
   there 's more children than couples wanting to adopt , though the children who currently ca n't find parent wo n't suddenly be adopted by gay couples . 
  there are reasons why nobody wants these . 
   is there a majority for it ? 
  apparently not . 
  why ? 
  we do n't want to have it . 
  if we wanted it we would have it . 
  it 's the same thing essentially . 
   that is the entire theory of punitive damages in the us , and it does a great job at deterring bad behavior . 
  actually it does n't . 
   $ 1 million is $ 1 million for a company , regardless of whether it goes to the state or the aggrieved parties . 
  exactly , so give it to the state . 
  the consumer only gets simple damages . 
  no , that 's not how it should be . 
   you should want to be made whole by the party that wronged you . 
  that is actually what vw is doing in europe . 
  actually he died for our sake , i think . 
  i just felt nitpicky , do n't worry about it . 
   it 's a century-old constitutional article ( \u00a7 140 ) \u00a7 140gg was passed in 1949 to be fair . 
  but the articles it copy/pastes into the gg are from 1919 , yes . 
  well , as i and all others have stated the answer you seek is : tradition . 
  long answer : tradition and nobody bothered to change it back in 1919 ( for germany ) when the weimar verfassung was passed because ... why ? 
  need a reason to change things , do n't you ? 
  what could possibly be the reason ? 
   i would , however , make this claim - the ekd may not be directly related directly institutionally to the predecessor state church , again : there never was a predecessing state church . 
  did n't i just tell you that ? 
   but it is still that body 's successor because lutheranism and calvinism are really theologically mutually exclusive . 
  it may just be a body of convenience but it embraces that role because of a historical antecedent . 
  and what antecedent would that be ? 
  all that happened was that the lutherans and calvinists * chose * to make a federation . 
  they even mutually accept each others baptisms , last suppers and priests , so they ca n't actually be mutually exclusive . 
  the ekd also never comes up in everyday discussion anywhere , i did n't even know about it before today . 
  the meeting of the catholic bishops of germany , whatever that is called , is much more important . 
    there is absolutely no involvement . 
   the tax scheme is a degree of involvement greater than what happens in the american system . 
  the tax scheme is absolutely no involvement in any way . 
  i literally just told you that . 
  the state collects the tax due for a fee . 
  ** that 's it ** . 
  literally any private company could do that for the churches or they could do it themselves , it just happens to be extra revenue for the state for no extra work and cheaper for the churches . 
   whether or not you accept it as involvement per-se seems to me to be a matter of semantics . 
  the state has absolutely no say on who pays or how much members are taxed , so there is objectively absolutely no involvement whatsoever . 
  do you know that any church can have this done by the church ? 
  yes , jews and muslims , too !, 
   it 's not going the church on sunday , it 's the government acknowledging one religions holidays over others . 
  well , that 's tradition . 
  we do expect our immigrats to integrate into * our * society and not to keep their own . 
  it 's different than in the usa and both of us think our way is better . 
   what you mean by the bible belt ? 
  i do n't like the religious beliefs in the south that make people hate homesexual people and try to ban abortion , but am not offended by people dressing up for church every sunday . 
  what government actions ? 
  did n't you understand from this thread that nobody cares if the holiday is called marias assumption ? 
  i , although living in a protestant state where it is n't an actual holiday , did n't even know why you were asking about august 15th until ten minutes in the thread . 
  do n't you think that example is kind of different than whether we actually go to church on sunday ? 
  should n't we be offended by the bible belt in that case ? 
   i am not saying that germany is non-secular oh , i was n't specifically talking about you . 
  i have had that discussion several times with different redditors , though . 
   rather the german tax system has a relationship with the ekd/catholic church that is based on the institutional history of the german government . 
  that statement is true how you wrote it . 
  possibly not how you meant it . 
   i should have been more clear and specified that the ekd is the institutional successor of the former state german church ; but it 's not . 
  the ekd was founded in 1945 . 
  * every denomination takes care of its own business . 
  * no denomination is to be preferred to any other ; ** there is no state church ** * noone shall be forced to perform any religious function or observe any religious festivity . 
  they even removed legitimacy from church weddings , since then only civil weddings were relevant to the state . 
  it actually forbade to perform the religious wedding before the civil . 
  and , this is important , this article is part of the current german constitution by referral . 
  even the wiki article on the evangelical church in germany makes no mention of your claim that prussia tried to unify the church . 
   either way it is a level of state involvement with religious affairs that goes beyond what happens in the states . 
  the german state is not involved in any religious affairs , no . 
  some bishops get paid by the state , but that 's just because the state took the churches possessions back in ` ye olde days and that 's the compensation the church got . 
  nothing weird about that . 
  the church decides who gets paid and the states pays . 
  that 's it . 
  there is absolutely no involvement . 
   to my knowledge , the ekd is derived from the prussian monarchy 's desire to unify religion in its kingdom . 
  apparently they failed ? 
   ** the evangelical church in germany ( german : evangelische kirche in deutschland , abbreviated ekd ) is a federation ** of twenty lutheran , reformed ( calvinist ) and united ( prussian union ) protestant regional and denominational churches in germany , collectively encompassing the vast majority of protestants in that country . 
  ** the ekd is not a church in a theological understanding , because of its denominational differences . 
  **  the calvinist hohenzollerns combined reformed churches with luthern ones in a single state church , not to my knowledge , but even if they did that would n't necessarily be the case today . 
  or more shortly put : germany does , currently , not have a state church of any denomination . 
   do n't most germans pay an income tax that funds the ekd ? 
  no german pays church tax to the ekd , no . 
  and i wo n't say most because i do n't know if more germans are catholic or protestant , but * many * germany pay church tax , sure .
