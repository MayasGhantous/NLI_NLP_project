  but that 's totally voluntary , you can just leave the church at any time . 
  redditors always think that church tax makes us somewhat non-secular , but it 's literally just a service provided by our irs to the churches * for a fee * . 
  it 's 7-10 % of your income tax due ( the church decides how much it is of course ) , so if you make $ 50k and have to pay $ 10k income tax on that * and * you are a member of a church tax collecting church then you owe $ 700-1000 church tax , which is collected by our irs and then paid to the church minus a 3 % fee last time i checked . 
  so the state collects a fee for next to no additional work . 
  in german we call it `` sad friday '' . 
  every year some atheists complain because they are n't allowed to dance on sad friday , everytime failing to understand that most people do n't really want to dance on a thursday night after they worked a full day . 
  and nobody wants to start dancing before midnight , so it is n't even a real inconvenience . 
   it does n't offend me or anything . 
  why would any holiday in europe offend you in any way ? 
   germany has a weird hybrid state church excuse me ? 
  did you confuse germany with some other country ? 
   i think that having a religious holiday could give some credence to the argument that other religions should have public holidays . 
  so let them have a holiday or two , that just means i 'd have one more day off from work ( and still get paid ) . 
  in germany some of the holidays are classified as `` extra sad '' so to speak , which means there is no dancing allowed in clubs from 00:00 to 23:59 on good friday for example . 
  why is it called good friday anyway ? 
  is n't it supposed to be sad ? 
   that 's what i was thinking . 
  in the us it would be a problem not to have it as so many people would want to take the day off . 
  important note : in europe holidays ( with the exception of the uk as far as i know ) mean that one must not work on the day , but still gets paid obviously . 
  have to have some holidays , why not use the ones you already had since time immemorial ? 
  nobody cares about whatever religion they 're associated with technically . 
   every large country is capable of making anything . 
  and the stuff you are currently buying from germany is available cheaper from china , but you still buy it from germany so you obviously * want * to buy it from germany . 
  and you will keep wanting that . 
   if someone can do it cheaper at the same quality we take it . 
  see , you do understand why you will keep buying our stuff no matter what . 
   as long as they are open to our more efficient services . 
  literally impossible without you being part of the common market and you do n't want to be that , so bye-bye and good riddance . 
   but we do n't need to buy it from you . 
  of course you do , if you would n't have to you would already buy the stuff from somewhere else . 
   just the same as you do n't need to buy insurance from us . 
  we 'll buy that from the same guys now living in frankfurt . 
  yeah , the uk will * totally * threaten us by saying `` we will put very high tariffs on stuff ~ ~ you want to sell us ~ ~ ** we need to buy from you ** '' while we are laughing about them . 
  actually i 'm already laughing right now . 
  idiotic , just idiotic . 
  left ? 
  what the hell ? 
  stern is left , not spiegel . 
   there goes the eus largest bargaining chip . 
  bargaining chip ? 
  what would we possibly want to bargain about ? 
   if it turns out to be 30 % we will haggle . 
  with * what * ? 
  you have absolutely nothing to offer that we need . 
   jpmorgan chase & co ( jpm.n ) chief executive jamie dimon said on monday that britain 's decision to leave the european union could lead to duplicate costs to provide banking services to european customers . 
  and we would care about jpmorgan having higher costs ... why exactly ? 
   london will offer insurance , investment banking and foreign exchange services to the rest of europe whatever . 
  is n't that illegal without passporting ? 
  so it wo n't happen , the city will move somewhere else and everything will be fine . 
  for us . 
  how is this news ? 
  the uk ** has ** to leave the single market because they do n't want a norway-deal . 
  norway-deal would be absolutely worst possible outcome for a brexit , from a british point of view . 
   just as you could n't recreate german car manufacturing in , say , denmark . 
  why could n't you ? 
  mercedes is making cars all over the world actually . 
  i pity your children . 
   giving their children german names . 
  that 's be a start , yeah . 
  anyone who names their child '' \u00d6zkan '' or whatever turks are called did n't understand the point of immigrating . 
   turks as ` different ' from germans even if they were 100 % german in language , culture , politics etc. 
  there 's maybe a hundred turks in germany that are 100 % german . 
  because the bank has its bank account at the ecb and pay a .3 % fine for storing its money there . 
  the article does n't say anywhere how germany supposedly made over a billion . 
   in order to extend the deadline you need a qualified majority , which is n't stated what that is in the article , not for all of the remaining member states to agree . 
  it literally says `` unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , ** unanimously ** decides to extend this period . 
   we were good europeans dude , seriously , you are being ridiculous . 
  it helps ** us ** . 
  we are no longer obligated to help * you * . 
  if you expected any other reaction you are an idiot . 
   the ultimate problem with article 50 is that the situation is stacked against the country calling it . 
  that 's by design . 
  i 'm rather sure those businesses have a legal right to that money . 
  he said that a european military alliance would only possible under his two conditions and that 's obviously wrong . 
  so why the hell do you think i do n't know what nato is ? 
  nato is possibly without either , so why would n't eto be possible . 
  actually i believe some americans will vote for trump * because * our foreign minister said this . 
  the point is that state-owned-companies obviously did not have to ** sell ** their profits to the crown . 
   yes , so they belong to the crown , no , they do n't . 
  you literally quoted that yourself . 
  one can not sell the surplus of an estate that already belongs to the crown to the crown , can one ? 
  you asked `` which value of article 2 is the uk in breach of '' , did n't you ? 
  i merely provided you with one , i 'm sure there are more . 
  but to answer your unrelated question : sure , they * could * , but they * wo n't . 
  the revenues do not belong to the monarch * because one of the earlier monarchs sold them to the crown * in exchange for the civil list . 
   in 1760 , george iii reached an agreement with the government over the estate . 
  the crown lands would be managed on behalf of the government and the surplus revenue would go to the treasury . 
  in return the king would receive a fixed annual payment - what later became known as the civil list . 
  he did not sell the actual estate , just the surplus . 
  sterling was worth even less in 2010/11 or so . 
  i clearly remember it being about 1.34 , was n't it ? 
  i bought lots of stuff on amazon.co.uk back then . 
   how about this : breach of rule of law . 
  the pm intends to remove the uk without parliamentary support/vote from the eu . 
  makes no sense to remove the country then by force , does it ? 
   the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  does n't the uk still ignore the verdict about voting rights for prisoners ? 
  pretty sure that one is either dignity , democracy , equality , human rights or actually all of the above . 
  that 's not a myth . 
  you 're nuts .
