  not generally wise to go into elections and tell people that they 're going to be made redundant because of your policy . 
  there is no risk of that . 
   recession is a fact you desperately want to believe , despite all evidence pointing towards that not happening . 
  actually all the evidence points to it happening , you are just ignoring it . 
   if it was up to parliament , we 'd still leave as remain mps have already pledged to honour the vote ( cos , you know , democracy ) . 
  i hope that wo n't actually happen . 
   leaving is an act of government however , nothing to do with parliament . 
  you can not be serious . 
  your prime minister could , on its own , have decided to leave for the last fourty years ? 
  without asking parliament ? 
  citation please , i do n't believe your pm has that kind of power . 
   and the house of lords ( lords is plural ) i know . 
   is a strictly advisory chamber that can only delay legislation . 
  i forgot you changed that . 
  that 's a pity , should n't have done that . 
   lots of things about leaving the eu are massive negatives but access to qualified labour is n't going to be a material issue . 
  of course it will be . 
  you can not get qualified workers from anywhere else . 
  totally , because all those pakistani are very skilled . 
  so how did they get their visum ? 
  i 'm not reading that 100kb article . 
  [ but i have a nice flowchart for you ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xnqb81f.jpg ) . 
  the regulations obviously are n't good enough . 
  i wonder why ? 
  bribes , maybe ? 
  quite sure the german system is not privatized . 
  am also quite sure one can buy private insurance in the uk if one wants to . 
   i do n't think it needs to take so much time . 
  it 's the time it takes for a country to join for the first time . 
  obviously . 
   it would be the first time in history a country would have joined twice . 
  scotland never joined before . 
   pretty sure scotland could benefit from a de facto agreement . 
  that is what i said . 
  scotland needs to have a vote and then say `` we 'll sign anything '' after that the commission will say `` yeah , seems good , will do '' and after that ** 27 ** different countries need to ratify and sign the contracts with scotland . 
  some of these even hold referendums on this issues . 
  it will take at least a year . 
  i do love hrh . 
  the obvious point was : germans are highly unlikely to apply for an h1-b . 
    there will obviously be less people willing to emigrate to the uk . 
   that 's a pointless statement without quantification . 
  it 's a true statement and obviousl i can not currently guesstimate the numbers . 
   do more people want to emigrate to the uk than they can handle ? 
  yes or no ? 
  if you count literally * all * indians and africans the answer is obviously yes . 
   if the answer is yes , then it simply does n't matter if less people want to come to the uk if the answer is still a bigger number than they can accept . 
  they wo n't be coming from the eu however . 
    most people applying for h1-bs are indians , are they not ? 
   a lot of that is because they way us tech companies handle the h1-b process . 
  do n't forget the us takes in around 1 million immigrants per year . 
  citation ? 
  only about 100k h1-bs for * skilled * immigrants . 
  all of the others won the greencard lottery and i do n't believe they hand out a million of them each year . 
   who the fuck ca n't look at the us here in the us and realize what a terrible idea for-profit , private-sector health care is ( when it 's the majority of the system without adequate `` utility style '' regulation . ), 
  the same people that believe leaving the eu was a good idea . 
   if you 're in asia or africa , i did very much talk about eu citizens . 
  you heard of them ? 
  the people with better education than those from asia or africa ? 
   but the uk gets a huge amount of skilled migration from outside europe and that will continue irrespective of whether the uk is outside the eu . 
  pretty sure leaving the eu was because of too much immigration . 
  so instead of eu citizens you 'd rather have more africans immigrate ? 
  do n't believe ukip agrees with that . 
   do n't be so condescending . 
  at least in australia moving to the uk either temporarily on a 2 year working visa or longer if you can find an employer sponsor is a very very common thing . 
  i never said it would n't . 
  i said it 's not surprising . 
   doctor from india or pakistan . 
  where do they want to go work ? 
  the u.k. no , shit ? 
  doctors from * india * or * pakistan * want to move to the uk ? 
  well then * obviously * the uk is the promised land of milk and honey !, 
  you are hilarious . 
  do you actually not realize that these doctors would move to literally any first world country that lets them in ? 
  it just happens that the uk is the easiest one to immigrate to because of the commonwealth . 
   stop being so closed minded . 
  it would appear that you 're looking at an average figure , not the most recent nominal figures . 
  i looked at and quoted to you the * actual * numbers from ** three different years ** . 
  those numbers are not true . 
   you can see it 's varied a lot , but the uk is still a net contributor . 
  accept you 're wrong . 
  i never said the uk would n't be a net contributor , it obviously is . 
  but it 's net contribution is only $ 5b and not $ 8.5 b. 
  i personally do n't believe that it makes any difference if it 's $ 5b , $ 8.5 b or $ 15b , however it seems important to you for reasons unknown to me . 
    i 'm sure you can fire them if you are forced to relocate your office to another country . 
  anything else is ludicrous . 
  i showed you to in the comment you are replying to . 
   they 're not being forced to though . 
  yes , they are . 
   and it 's not ludicrous , it 's the law . 
  well then cite the actual law please . 
   yes . 
  iceland , norway , liechtenstein and norway . 
  they 're all part of the single market , and so allow free movement . 
  but wait , what 's this !? 
  there are other countries in the world that trade with the eu !? 
  but they are n't in the common market . 
  so no `` the city '' anymore for the uk . 
    i actually just proved that it will . 
   you actually claimed that it would , because one person in the ecb said it would . 
  that 's not proof , that 's one person 's opinion , and he is n't even a negotiator .
