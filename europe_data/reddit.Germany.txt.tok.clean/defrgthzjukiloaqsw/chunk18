  you will not get any exemption in the negotiations . 
  if the eu would give you * any * it could mean that other countries start believing leaving is a good idea . 
  ca n't have that . 
   can you imagine placing reciprocal tariffs on the uk ? 
  germany relies on britons buying their cars . 
  the uk * has * to buy foreign-made cars because they do n't have any of their own , they 'll just be more expensive to you . 
   the uk is a massive economy getting ready to open free trade agreements with the world , including the eu . 
  maybe wait for actual numbers and proof before you unilaterally decide the uk is in recession . 
  recession is a fact you just do n't want to believe because your country made the most idiotic decision ever . 
  but hey , you can still hope that parliament wo n't actually leave the eu . 
  does the house of lord get a veto on that ? 
  maybe they have some sense in them . 
  you could control ** non - ** eu-immigration . 
  and i 'm pretty sure , although i have no actual knowledge on this , that immigrating to the uk is easier for commonwealth citizens than immigrating to another eu country . 
  and i 'm not only speaking about the language . 
  you never thought about these people * wanting * to live in * the eu * because that makes everything easier ? 
   there are plenty of doctors who would love the opportunity to work in the uk . 
  obviously . 
  but in the future those doctors wo n't be german , french , danish or italian anymore , but indian , pakistani , bangladeshi or from peru . 
  no , it 's correct . 
  the only thing you could n't control is * non - * eu immigration obviously . 
   and try to kick out all the immigrants . 
  it will . 
  by leaving alone millions of people will have lost their right to reside . 
  will * all * of them get automatic permanent residence permits immediately ? 
  i doubt it . 
   the trade will stop - right , because both eu and uk desperately want to lose billions just to spite each other . 
  that 's actually not a problem at all . 
  but the uk will have to pay tariffs of course . 
   the professional immigration will stop - right , because uk will surely stop importing highly educated people , just like usa , there will obviously be less people willing to emigrate to the uk . 
   just like usa , with it 's draconic immigration policy , does n't . 
  most people applying for h1-bs are indians , are they not ? 
  and there 's only about 100k new ones each year . 
  why would i ask for a visa to london when i can move much easier to paris ? 
  you 're not thinking straight . 
  oh my , people want to move from * the commonwealth * to the uk ? 
  damn , the uk sure must be amazing !, 
  does n't ukip want to privatize the nhs ? 
   wait til the scots say so with a vote . 
  then they wo n't be part of the eu after they left the uk . 
  obviously we can fasttrack the process by scotland saying `` we 'll sign all eu contracts as they are '' and all other 27 countries saying `` well , then come on in '' . 
  but even that will take at least 1-1 .5 years . 
   but it is accurate though , that 's straight from hm treasury , and i have no idea where these numbers are appearing from . 
  apparently they are using the wrong numbers , you already confirmed that by excluding money going from the eu to universities in the uk . 
   one of them is a jpeg without you saying where it 's from though , so it 's not a source really . 
  i told you that 's from our bbc news report . 
   but narrative ? 
  there is no narrative . 
  the entire uk agrees and knows what our contributions to the eu are , and they are all wrong apparently . 
  your net contributions are about $ 5b . 
  that 's `` money going from uk to the eu minus * any * money coming from the eu to any entity whatsoever inside of the uk '' . 
   far better to assume that we 're looking at different years , and different exchange rates , instead of throwing accusations around . 
  but we 're not . 
  you are wrong . 
   i 'm not sure what ad hominen attacks are going to achieve here , but it is widely accepted that it 's germany that takes leadership in eu matters . 
  that 's not a good or bad thing internationally , it just means that germany is using its influence to steer the eu . 
  good for you though !, 
  that does n't mean the eu is a `` german project '' . 
   i 'm getting figures of eur7 billion , over the 2007-2013 period , which works out to around # 730 million a year on average . 
  irritatingly , the eu does n't always give figures for year on year . 
  that 's a pittance compared to any government budget . 
  i said $ 3.5 b because you claim the net contribution is $ 8.5 while you exclude these payments and the real net contribution is $ 5b so apparently you believe these payments are about $ 3.5 b. 
  thought this would be obvious . 
   because the uk is a different country ? 
  and because we actually have pretty strong employee rights , despite what the left of british politics professes ? 
  you ca n't fire someone in this country if they do n't want to edit their contract . 
  i 'm sure you can fire them * if * you are forced to relocate your office to another country . 
  anything else is ludicrous . 
    nah , that 's actually how that works . 
   i assume you have a source then . 
  i showed you to in the comment you are replying to . 
   you know the eurozone = / = the eu right ? 
  no , shit ?!, 
   also , most importantly , he 's lying . 
  plenty of countries have trade deals with the eu and single market without being part of it . 
  there are four countries who are part of the single market and all of them also allow freedom of movement , which you do n't want . 
  so obviously there is absolutely no way for you to get into the single market . 
   as an ecb official , he 's trying to boost confidence by claiming the eurozone is better off without the uk , hardly a neutral source on the matter . 
  yup , all expert always push their own agenda . 
  obviously . 
  makes perfect sense that the * one * person who is supposed to actually know requirements of where ( investment ) banks and clearing houses * have * to be located does n't tell us the actual laws , right ? 
  they ** will ** move . 
  it 's a fact . 
  the uk got a special exemption , as it too often did , when it did n't join the euro . 
  and the pass-porting only works if the foreign bank is located * in an eu member * , which it no longer will be . 
  and no , you will not get an exception from that . 
    the city will move to the continent if the uk actually leaves the eu . 
   the city wo n't move to the continent when the uk actually leaves the eu . 
  i actually just proved that it will . 
   some eu jobs might float over to britain though , seeing as countries worldwide are already lining up to get trade deals . 
  you 're positively insane , seriously . 
  have fun during your recession , but do n't come begging for potatoes when you 're hungry . 
  you linked to a source i ca n't read , and in response i 've cited more sources that show the # 8.5 billion figure is accurate . 
  but it 's not accurate . 
   i 'm more inclined to trust multiple sources that agree with another , than your one outlier , especially since it 's the eu that has an interest in stating that the uk does n't pay that much . 
  than my * three * sources . 
  i actually told you what they were . 
  twice . 
  but you just want to believe what fits your narrative . 
   and why does n't it ?
