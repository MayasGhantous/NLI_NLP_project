  that 's money going into your country , is n't it ? 
  because it 's not going to the government ? 
  why would it matter where it goes ? 
  it 's staying in the uk . 
   and because it 's sod all money anyway ? 
  apparently it 's at least $ 3.5 billion . 
    obviously , but that 's the point of having an eu . 
   to have strong economies give money to poor countries ? 
  yes . 
   the eu was originally about trade . 
  have to start somewhere . 
    now you are getting weird . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
   the eu is seen as a german project . 
  you 're the biggest supporters , a founding member , and pay the most money in . 
  initiatives are generally german , and you 're the leading voice of europe . 
  it 's a mainly german project . 
  by brits that do n't know reality ? 
  that 's just not true . 
   you say `` of course '' as if it 's obvious , but i 'm afraid i do n't see that . 
  why are you against the uk 's participation in erasmus exactly ? 
  because the uk is going to leave the eu ? 
  and erasmus is kind of difficult without freedom of movement anyway . 
  did n't we cover already that the uk must be punished ? 
    you can fire and will fire all your employees when you close your office in london . 
  they can get new contracts in frankfurt . 
   well , no , that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how anything works . 
  yes , that is indeed how it works . 
  if that is legal in germany , and it actually is , why would n't it be legal in the uk ? 
  a country that usually has * less * strong employee rights ? 
    and as far as i read most of the banks have to move because they have to be located inside a euro-zone country and only got a special exemption last time that the uk would be good enough . 
   got a source for that ? 
  sounds like bullshit to me . 
  nah , that 's actually how that works . 
   [ banks have already begun to take action to shift operations out of the uk , but most of their staff will have to wait several months to find out ** how many ** thousands of them will be asked to move to fledgling financial hotspots like paris , dublin and frankfurt . 
  ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/a3a92744-3a52-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7 )  the big us banks -- jpmorgan chase , goldman sachs , bank of america , citigroup and morgan stanley -- have large operations employing tens of thousands of people in the uk . 
  they have historically set up their regulated businesses in ** britain and then used its right to `` passport '' into the rest of the 28-member bloc . 
  **  the uk could try to adopt the path followed by norway , which is a member of the european economic area but not the eu . 
  but that has drawbacks : it requires britain to implement all of the eu 's rules without having a say in writing them . 
   [ a top ecb official said banks in the city of london risked being stripped of their lucrative eu `` passports '' that allow them to sell services to the rest of the union . 
  fran\u00e7ois villeroy de galhau said ** keeping the so-called `` passport '' would not be possible if the uk leaves the single market of trade in goods and services . 
  ** ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/city-of-london-could-be-cut-off-from-europe-says-ecb-official ) literally the first two results on google for `` london finance move ecb '' . 
  the city * will * move to the continent * if * the uk actually leaves the eu . 
   well , it was n't particularly helpful to link to a german pdf , but you appear to be using different figures . 
  the government sends # 8.5 billion a year to the eu , another source for you . 
  here 's another source . 
  did n't i just prove that 's not true ? 
  i 'm quite more inclined to believe the eu , the german bbc so to speak and our agency for political education . 
  seems much more trustworthy . 
  the net number ( money leaving uk -  eu minus money coming back into the uk , because that 's the only interesting number . ), 
  is around $ 5b , however you want to spin in . 
  so you got $ 5b to spend on stuff , oh my , so much money , what will we you do with that ? 
  quite ridiculous to complain about this kind of tuppence . 
   that does n't include direct payments to non-government entities ( such as university research ) . 
  and why does n't it ? 
  that 's money going into your country , is n't it ? 
   but it 's still a net gain for the eu , seeing as however you look at it , the uk is a net contributor . 
  obviously , but that 's the point of having an eu . 
   gosh , the germans pay more money into a german-centric project !, 
  now you are getting weird . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
   or perhaps demand a rebate or other reduction for itself ? 
  you 're the de facto leaders for the eu , you could have got it if you wanted it . 
  but you did n't want it , so stop complaining that the uk did . 
  we are complaining because you keep complaining and no others do . 
  it 's annoying . 
  at least that part will stop now , so there 's that . 
    which is the whole point of the eu in the first place since over fourty years . 
   not quite , the eu has n't actually been around that long . 
  are you one of those that googled `` what is the eu '' on friday ? 
  the uk joined the european community in 1973 . 
    pretty sure we ejected switzerland because they put a limit on migration . 
  turkey and macedonia ? 
  seriously ? 
  that 's probably a kind of developmental aid . 
   wrong way round , switzerland voted against it . 
  yes , they voted against migration . 
  and then we ejected them because they violated the treaty . 
   also , developmental aid ? 
  you do n't give money to members to participate . 
  where did i say that ? 
  letting turks go to our universites so they 'll go back and build bridges or whatnot in turkey is developmental aid . 
  we do the same for any other country on earth . 
   are you for or against uk being in erasmus ? 
  against of course . 
   uh , no . 
  we have labour protection laws in this country ( that are n't in the slightest bit dependant on the eu , btw ) . 
  you ca n't fire someone for refusing to emigrate to another country . 
  you can fire and will fire all your employees when you close your office in london . 
  they can get new contracts in frankfurt . 
  and as far as i read most of the banks have to move because they have to be located inside a euro-zone country and only got a special exemption last time that the uk would be good enough . 
    it 's only # 4.7 billion . 
   not true . 
  `` in 2015 the uk government paid # 13 billion to the eu budget , and eu spending on the uk was # 4.5 billion . 
  so the uk 's ` net contribution ' was estimated at about # 8.5 billion . '', 
  that 's an independent fact-checker by the way . 
  it 's not true . 
   [ the uk paid $ 12.1 b to the eu and got $ 6.7 b back for a net of $ 5.4 b ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/brussels/website/media/modul_07/zusatzthemen/pdf/nettozahler.pdf ) in 2010 . 
  that 's the actual eu numbers right from the source .
