  - includes the uk . 
  it 's not the fault of `` the eu '' that they move once a month , it 's literally written in the treaties that they must do that . 
  i 'm sure they do n't actually want to move monthly . 
  i have no idea what point he is trying to make , he is not making sense . 
  and hundreds of kilometers of etcs . 
  if you are pissed about leaving the eu then maybe ** you ** should vote to remain and be happy about that . 
  you are ridiculous , the eu does n't have to give the uk anything . 
  actually it * should n't * give them anything to discourage further blackmail by other countries . 
   education in english speaking countries is simply considered to be more valuable than other places that 's just nuts . 
  education in english speaking countries might be more popular than education in other countries but only ** because it 's in english ** , the language everyone speaks anyway . 
  that 's the only reason . 
  and you do realize that erasmus is a study abroad program designed for a semester per student right ? 
  there is no need for that anyway . 
  the only people getting fucked by the uk leaving it are * british * people . 
  and they chose to get fucked by voting to leave . 
    it 's a contract   you do n't change them depending on the current location  why not ? 
  why is marriage different in that regard ? 
  it 's not . 
  contracts do n't change when the contracted parties move to other countries and neither does the law governing the contract . 
  i actually believe denying them efta or eea is not vindictive , it 's what they wanted . 
  but we should n't jump through any other hoops because we can not allow countries that left to pick & choose what they like . 
  it sets a bad example . 
   erasmus involves several non eu countries already and funding it alongside continuing student loans for eu students does not result in a loss for the uk so it will likely be continued as it signals cooperation and not fucking over hundreds of thousands of people . 
  but * you * fucked those people over , not us . 
  your own people even , so that 's your own problem . 
  do n't make the mistake to believe that our students somehow * need * to study in the uk for some reason . 
   i do n't think you understand how diplomacy or any of politics works , it 's never all or nothing . 
  if you believe it is then you do not belong in a discussion of such a sensitive nature as a major country 's potential exit of the eu . 
  if we were to give the uk * anything * after they left other countries might get the same idea . 
  so we wo n't be doing that . 
   let 's not get vindictive here . 
  on the contrary , let 's . 
  you vote out ? 
  you 're out . 
  no eea for you . 
  no efta . 
  not that you would want either anyway because they come with freedom of movement , so those are out by your own choice even . 
  the uk has been complaining for decades and even after getting their very own special rebate and additional concessions recently for * blackmailing * us they are ( maybe ) still voting to leave . 
  so let them leave , but also let them be * on their own * just like they want . 
   not really , there are many projects with ties to the eu that are not directly connected to the eu ( erasmus , horizon 2020 ) , erasmus is funded completely by the eu , you will no longer be part of that . 
   equally there will be parts of the eu that both sides will want to keep and they probably will be kept as that 's how diplomacy works . 
  even if the eu will kindly allow you to * apply * for something then that 's a totally different part from leaving the eu . 
  the leaving is easy . 
  you can not have it both ways and pick and choose , if you 're out then you 're out . 
  case closed . 
  easy : you can not keep * anything * . 
  because you left the eu . 
  you certainly may * apply nicely * to get a new deal of some kind , which we will hopefully refuse laughing . 
  what would be the process now ? 
  you have a vote , you declare you are leaving and then after two years you are officially out . 
  * that 's it * . 
  no negotiations required . 
  farage should have some kind of idea what will happen after you get out . 
  i also am hopeful that a trump presidency might result in a complete reboot and overhaul of the usa 's operating system . 
  well , like a .1 % hope , but they might finally get the kick in the head they need to get into the 21st century . 
  what negotiations ? 
  if you leave you leave , no negotiations required for that . 
  all of that seems quite plausible , not sure what your problem is . 
   he could make something up if that would make you happy but he still has no idea what cameron and his government would do nor would he be invited to the conversation . 
  what do you mean ? 
  would n't they then leave the eu ? 
  the point of the question `` what happens if the public votes leave ? '', 
  is '' * what happens after we left * '' . 
  is that not obvious ? 
  it 's like how i want trump to become president . 
  sometimes i just want to see what happens . 
  what 's this about toilets ? 
  they are not allowed to pray anywhere and that 's how it should be . 
  you are making a joke are you ? 
  their banks will move to frankfurt . 
  you will be . 
   you should go to your local school then . 
  you will find that every school has not every room occupied at the same time ... students would be in class or not in class . 
  while they are on break ** they are required to go outside ** for the umpteenth time . 
   again how about we try to be reasonable . 
  if there is a suffient number of pastafarians that need a room to meditate well there is probably space . 
  same for a place to meditate during break . 
  that would require schools to provide ten prayer rooms . 
  how ` bout * no * prayer rooms instead , mh ? 
  enjoy your crippling recession then . 
   that 's right , but practically there are rooms that are not used at a specific point i have never seen a school with such rooms , why are they not used ? 
  and did you forget about '' * no children allowed inside during break * '' ? 
   or do you not think that there are always empty rooms ? 
  of course i do n't , why would there be empty rooms ? 
    and then next week the pastafarians demand pasta for every meal and a room of their own , too . 
   so then we talk about that if it comes to that ... by then it 's too late because then your only options are : * give pastafarians pasta and room . 
  and next week when the hindus come given them a room and ban all beef . 
  by then you will have a vegetarian school because pork has been banned already . 
  oh and no more milk for lunch !, 
  might get in contact with ~ ~ pork ~ ~ beef and then it 'd no longer be kosher !, 
  * take the room back from the muslims , prepare to get slaughtered in the media * do n't give preferential treatment to anyone in the first place . 
  the last option is obviously the correct one . 
  but it does hurt me , that room can not be used for something else . 
  and then next week the pastafarians demand pasta for every meal and a room of their own , too . 
  is that really that hard to understand ? 
  no school i 've ever seen . 
  and the point is that children should play outside in the fresh air during breaks . 
  and even if there were such rooms it would still be preferential treatment , what part about that do n't you understand ? 
  what about not wanting to give them preferential treatment did n't you understand ? 
   there are always rooms that are n't in active use , particularly during breaks .
