  did you miss the part where i said students are usually not allowed in classrooms during breaks ? 
  that 's so weird , have you gone to a specific church of england school ? 
  during breaks students are usually not allowed in classrooms and praying in public hallways would advertise religion , which is forbidden for obvious reasons . 
   let them use a room that is otherwise unoccupied ( not a room specifically for prayer ) during said break times . 
  you mean give them preferential treatment because they like to pray ? 
  not gon na happen . 
   how is that the reasonable solution ? 
  religion might have no place in education but that 's a far cry from saying that you should ban it entirely for children . 
  but you should . 
   it 's a parents right to bring a child up how they like no , that right ends at child abuse . 
   crazy idea here : what if by accommodating their religious beliefs , we 'd actually be helping them learn ? 
  what if by not accomodating their crazy beliefs we are actually helping them break free from their parents indoctrination ? 
   i went to school with a number of devout muslims who followed the standard prayer schedule . 
  they generally did their prayers between class changes , or during recess and lunch breaks . 
  the `` worst '' of the interruption consisted of students quietly slipping back into class maybe 2 minutes later than the others . 
   having experienced it , i simply do n't agree that it 's unreasonably disruptive at all . 
  students being two minutes late to class every day is not distruptive in your opinion ? 
   as a provider , when you do n't need to do it then you just do n't . 
  but you do , that is what you are telling us . 
  you use it for analytics , you do n't ** need ** to do analytics and yet you do collect personal data without permission . 
   the reasons are stated above . 
  you still did not give a single reason . 
   again . 
   for analytics . 
  for any sort of personalisation of the experience ( remembering options , etc ) . 
  so you ** do n't ** have a need , great you cleared that up . 
   you can setup your browser nobody does that . 
   pointless to repeat the same thing over and over again . 
  maybe sometime you will understand that you did never give a reason why you ** need ** cookies ? 
  you never gave a single reason why you ** need ** to track users . 
  you just want to because it makes you money . 
  and then when the eu informs you that what you 've been doing was very illegal then you complain about the evil eu making you conform with existing laws . 
  how outrageous !, 
  why do n't you stop tracking users ? 
  you never have a ** need ** to do that . 
   i 'm extremely pro-privacy apparently you do n't know what that means . 
   allows to profile the user much better . 
  that 's no reason to track the user , he already told you . 
  it 's also incredibly illegal in the eu to collect personal data about anyone without their consent , hence the information about the cookie . 
   allows for persistent sessions , for accounts only if logged in , you were supposed to give examples why you need cookies if the user is not logged in . 
  as already mentioned in this comment chain : the equipment necessary to send the signal to the drones is in ramstein . 
  hey , if they leave and then come crawling back to get back in we can finally get rid of the uk rebate . 
  first two minutes were actually pretty okay . 
  just not the part that op linked . 
  i 'm not the one from the uk , you replied to the wrong guy . 
  actually * you * complained until we were nice and gave you a rebate . 
  then you shut up for a couple of years and started complaining again . 
  it 's annoying . 
  stop it . 
  go shoot yourself in the foot by leaving , we do n't care anymore . 
  no , the uk wants to be a usa and the treaties , commission , ecj and echr wo n't allow that thankfully . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  you got a rebate you do n't deserve * and * still complain about paying . 
  you guys are insane . 
  at this point we are basically hoping the uk leaves just so they finally shut up . 
  you can not actually believe that , you even get a special rebate no one else gets . 
  please leave finally . 
  or stay , but stop complaining . 
  it 's annoying . 
  that 's a bit arrogant of you , is n't it ? 
  staying in the eu helps ** you ** , not us , we 'd manage . 
   english is the lingua franca of computer science jobs , and berlin is a global , cosmopolitan city . 
  i do n't believe that , but i have no actual information about that . 
  does n't make sense to me that germans in a german company in berlin would speak english just because the company could possibly hire an odd american . 
  you are baselessly generalizing that their education is somehow equal to ours . 
  i wonder who is more likely to be correct . 
  oh , well , sure they can get a blue card just the as everyone else . 
  not to my knowledge . 
  sweden really makes it easy . 
  til engineers in sweden are n't actually educated . 
  the point is : if `` refugees '' are cheaper it may make sense to hire them . 
  it 's called `` logic '' . 
  but a lot of third-worlders actually come to study to germany , it 's part of our foreign aid . 
  but afterwards they obviously prefer to stay . 
  because oil `` engineers '' working onsite in some shithole are totally qualified , right ? 
  actually i think it 's more naive , they just do n't know . 
  those few are n't part of the `` refugees '' . 
  they either stayed where they studied or took a plane to whereever would give them a work visa . 
  probably some developing country somewhere . 
  over in / r/germany we quite often get the question `` will i be handed a job immediately without knowing german ? '' . 
  apparently the answer surprises most americans . 
  that 'll do it . 
  you are a very weird person . 
   in austria you are only allowed to work if you have a positive result . 
  that 's why i asked for `` 1 % '' , that 's the percentage of those allowed to work in sweden who got a job . 
  it 's in the article . 
  anyhow , 25 % is surprisingly much . 
  do you possibly not have have minimum wage for refugees ? 
  what are they going to do without speaking german or good english and without any actual relevant skills ? 
    it 's a country free of engineers educated to western standards . 
   does n't mean that they ca n't engineer a bike . 
  does mean they wo n't find a job where they would have to design a bike . 
    what you are referring to is known as `` kitchen help/aid '' and there 's lots of locals available to do that job . 
   but none that can teach you syrian recipes . 
  i have no idea how to answer to this . 
  considering he was apparently able to get a residence permit without getting a job first i assume he married a swede . 
   500 / 162.000 = ~ ~ 3,1 % ~ ~ ** 0.31 % ** ftfy, 
  more than 1 % got jobs in other countries ? 
  any source on that ? 
   syria is n't a country free of , for example , engineers .
