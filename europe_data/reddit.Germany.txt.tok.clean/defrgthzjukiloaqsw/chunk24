  it 's a country free of engineers educated to western standards . 
   other trades have simple requirements , or you can learn them while doing the job -- cooks come to mind . 
  not in west europe . 
  what you are referring to is known as `` kitchen help/aid '' and there 's lots of locals available to do that job . 
  damn , that girls parents need to get prosecuted for child abuse . 
  i just told you that the burden of proof is on youtube , did n't i ? 
  yes , of course . 
  it 's much easier to do it this way . 
  it ** is ** entirely youtubes fault . 
  youtube just needs to either : * pay according to the published tariff . 
  instant solution . 
  * agree with gema on a contract . 
  instead ** youtube chose ** to not do either . 
   however , the gema does n't have direct contracts with all artists of the world , most non-german artists are with their local rights collecting society instead of gema . 
  obviously , but those obviously have contracts with gema . 
   those other rcses probably have an interest to have their videos available in germany and thus might start negotiating with the c3s instead of the gema . 
  ridiculous . 
  they could have changed their contracts with gema already if they wanted to . 
   and even if they do n't , if the c3s gets allowed in germany , the gema-vermutung will need to get dropped or at least re-worked , allowing youtube to no longer block videos that could contain gema-music , but only videos that do contain gema-music . 
  youtube currently ** does not need to block videos that contain non-gema-music ** . 
  they just have to have proof available on request if they do n't . 
  this is entirely youtubes fault . 
   once there is a competing collecting society only if it actually gets someone to sign up . 
  which wo n't happen . 
  except for a couple retards obviously . 
  if you can not demand cease & desist from anyone who opens his wifi then you stop being able to demand that from ** anyone ** . 
  actually from that moment on everyone could just claim `` nope , was n't me who torrented , i just provided free wifi !, 
  his point is that one can torrent whatever one wants using free wifi . 
   because according to german laws isp isps are exempt . 
  bullshit , no one will use c3s . 
   which in turn means that youtube only needs to block videos they know have gema content in them ( and not , like it is currently , block videos that could have gema content in them ) and when youtube does not block a gema-related video then youtube will pay a rather huge amount to gema * and * a fine . 
  nothing germany can do about youtube refusing to pay . 
  guys , there is more than enough european stuff already on netflix . 
  what ? 
  * google must not store information about me in a database . 
  * google does store information about me in a database . 
  * i found out , demand them to remove information about me in database . 
  ** press thinks this is a new law and call it the right to be forgotten ** * google is idiot and does not remove information about me in database , only pretends to do so in my country of residence . 
  * court tells google they are idiots and enforces decades old law . 
  * google throws tantrum . 
  yeah , the point is they must not store the information . 
  i already said this . 
   1 ) nope . 
  the `` anywhere '' part is n't enforceable whatsoever . 
  of course it is . 
  if google does business in france it must abide by french laws and those say `` do n't store about about our citizens without their permission ! '' . 
   3 ) the law actually does n't even cover what they can/can ' t store . 
  just what they can display in results . 
  no , you do n't know what you are talking about . 
  that is why i explained that to you . 
  the ecj found that googles search is a database because one can search it for `` name '' and it is forbidden to save data in databases without permission . 
  ** that ** is the law . 
  it is ** not ** a new law . 
  it is indeed very old and it does ** not ** say `` i get to demand deletions from search engines . 
  it does n't . 
  the right means that google must not store data about french citizens in their databases if they do n't consent . 
  this is the actual law , this is very different from what you think it is . 
  * a : it is ** not ** : a right to stop data being shown to others . 
  * b : it is : a right to stop google from * storing * data about someone without that ones consent . 
  neither a nor b is sought to apply worldwide by anyone . 
   yes , which is why they abide by french law when doing business in france ( aka showing results to the french ) . 
  yes , while doing business in france they * must not store data about non-consenting individuals in their database anywhere * . 
  this is what they are prohibited to do and what they claim they should n't have to . 
   can you name a case where privacy of one 's individual extends beyond his home country 's borders , it does n't do that in this case . 
  google does business in france , french laws apply . 
  it 's not surprising . 
  you comment is just too stupid , it would make absolutely no sense to spend time educating you . 
  good god , what is wrong with you people . 
  yes , and because they do business in france they have to abide by french law . 
  * especially * if it concerns french residents . 
  it 's really not that surprising . 
   1 ) because google is a us company . 
  it abides by us laws . 
  his point is that google abides to us laws even * outside of the usa * . 
  so it 's perfectly logical to expect that it abides to french laws * outside of france * . 
  it 's the same thing . 
  makes perfect sense actually . 
  what is forbidden is for google to store information about persons in a database * without their permission * . 
  google will lose . 
  what possible reasons could residents of b&h have to not want to join the eu ? 
  dude , that 's just bullshit with the sickness , stop looking for loopholes and accept facts . 
   another event dubbed a `` battle of the sexes '' took place during the 1998 australian open [ 33 ] between karsten braasch and the williams sisters . 
  venus and serena williams , aged 17 and 16 respectively , had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world 's top 200 , so braasch , then ranked 203rd , challenged them both . 
  braasch was described by one journalist as `` a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager . 
  '' [ 34 ] the matches took place on court number 12 in melbourne park , [ 35 ] after braasch had finished a round of golf and two beers . 
  he first took on serena and after leading 5 -- 0 , beat her 6 -- 1 . 
  venus then walked on court and again braasch was victorious , this time winning 6 -- 2 . 
  [ 36 ] braasch said afterwards , `` 500 and above , no chance . '', 
  he added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game `` fun . 
  '' [ 37 ] braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier , and that men put spin on the ball that the women ca n't handle . 
  the williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350 . : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_sexes_ ( tennis ) # 1998 : _ karsten_braasch_vs . _ the_williams_sisters, 
   thru the prosecutor . 
  that is in a criminal case ( say , wife-beating ) the ` victim ' does n't need to have a lawyer to argue , the prosecutor as he prosecutes the criminal case can also get the judge to order the guy to stay away . 
  ah , that 's not a thing in germany . 
  also , to be more precise , erdogan got a temporary restraining order in this case . 
  german courts grant these before deciding on the merits if the potential ongoing damage could n't be recovered by damages after the verdict . 
   oh , i thought erdogan was seeking injunctive relief ( and perhaps a defamation judgment ) through his lawyers in a civil court and the court issued a preliminary injunction . 
  he did and the court did . 
  this is the civil case . 
   how many cases/avenues are there ?
