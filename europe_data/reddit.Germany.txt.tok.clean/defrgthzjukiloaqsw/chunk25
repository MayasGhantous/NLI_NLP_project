  you are telling me there can be/is a criminal case under 103 ( foreign head of state thing ) 185 ( which i assume is criminal insult ) . 
  no , only one criminal case . 
  and in germany the court can convict for whatever turns out applicable in the end , not only for things the prosecutor charged like on american tv . 
  \u00a7 185 is criminal insult , \u00a7 103 is criminal insult against foreign heads of state . 
  it 's the same thing with a harsher maximum sentence . 
   is there also a civil case pursued by erdogan 's lawyers ? 
  of course , how else could one get an injunction ? 
  i have a feeling you may have misunderstood something . 
  - civil case : is like it is and like it was and like it ever will be . 
  * criminal case - \u00a7 103 may be repealed or not , it does n't really matter because it 's a crime anyway in \u00a7 185 . 
  this case op linked to is the civil case in which an injunction was granted , yes . 
  why ? 
   a given man is n't always going to be stronger than a given woman . 
  a given man * who had the same amount and kind of training * is always going to be stronger than a given woman . 
   `` intelligence is n't a statistical matter that can be simply scanned , '' she added . 
  read more : http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/1.714731 yes , it is . 
  just yesterday i tried to explain another american that police can actually find and catch and prosecute drunk driver , he kept answering with `` do you know how large the bar district is ?!?!?!?!, 
  we have more drunk per capita ! '', 
  as if catching ten drunks every week would n't change a thing . 
  you know , instead of just catching them * after * they killed someone . 
  but on the other hand they expect everyone who says `` idiot '' to anyone to get thrown in jail as if that would actually happen . 
  i do n't understand them . 
   basically , this was one of two cases against him . 
  this one says certain passages in the poem may not be recited under penalty of jail or a monetary fine . 
  you are writing this as if it were special . 
  it 's a tro . 
  happens every day all day everwhere . 
   and for the record : the poem is horseshit and it was recitated while acknowledging this would be illegal and not protected under satire . 
  exactly , no one is actually surprised by any of this . 
  you are kind of all over the place , contradicting yourself . 
  it 's really not , you guys have to stop saying dumb stuff like that . 
   well , theoretically it could happen . 
  yeah , but it wo n't . 
   it is hamburg the criminal trial will be in hamburg ? 
  i think that 's unlikely . 
  well , technically the word `` appeal '' is correct . 
  * but * the `` appeal '' will be the hauptsacheverfahren in the * first * instance . 
  and the word does , to me at least , have a `` berufung '' connotation . 
   b\u00f6hmermann also wants to go into appeal , there was n't even a * first * trial yet . 
  will still be a crime to insult people so it does n't change anything substantial . 
  true , in that case the ministerpr\u00e4sident has that right . 
  or the state government in case of berlin , bremen , hamburg or saarland . 
  wo n't happen of course . 
  exactly , does n't change the sentence . 
  you got that wrong , they want to repeal ** \u00a7 103 ** . 
   he made it obvious that they did not reflect his personal opinion . 
  her certainly claimed that , but it is very obvious that he was lying . 
  indeed , b\u00f6hmermann fully intended to get prosecuted . 
  but it wo n't actually change anything if it gets repealed . 
   iirc did n't the german government also say that they were going to repeal the law they said they intend to ** ask ** the parliament to repeal the law . 
  the government can not do this , you know that , right ? 
   so this might be the last such ruling . 
  no , \u00a7 185 will remain . 
  i think there is a 0 % chance that insulting will get legal , because our constitution requires the state to protect everyones dignity and therefore requires the punishment of insults . 
  could change the maximum punishment of course , but it 's never used anyway . 
   the way the criminal case will most likely go down is that his lawyers will drag it out until the law is repealed . 
  \u00a7 185 wo n't get repealed , so that would n't help much . 
  this is about a temporary restraining order . 
  the article does n't even mention that anyone was convicted or any kind of sentence . 
  important note : this article is about a ** temporary restraining order ** . 
  difficult , entries are only allowed a maximum of six people on stage . 
  oh , thanks but not necessary , yours was actually good . 
  on the other hand . . ours was n't * that * bad , was it ? 
  just like last year when we literally got zero points for [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgmjochtrpc ) , which had no chances at winning , but * zero * ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  i voted for belgium !, 
  [ what you will find is feta cheese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feta ) , but that 's sheep . 
  but feta is only really available at the greek restaurant or at pizza deliveries . 
  and in supermarkets of course . 
  you wo n't find much goat cheese anywhere in germany . 
   ts actually better : they recently got the green light for it from the government . 
  they did not . 
  you should n't imply they needed anyones `` green light '' to sell a burger . 
  this is at least wrong for germany . 
  you do n't * lose * your license if you drive ** 31 ** over the limit . 
  it 's just suspended for a month . 
  so just pay the fucking taxi with your credit card , what 's the problem ? 
   there problem is that taxi fares are kept unreasonable high by limiting the number of licences given out . 
  no , that 's necessary because taxis have to make a decent living and in exchange are required to transport anyone for the same fee at any time of the day . 
  because honestly american taxis suck hard . 
  so who 'd be paying the taxes the hotels would safe ? 
   and they bring in tourists who come to your city , spend money , and leave . 
  they do n't bring any new tourists . 
   in-fact there were large parts that believed that saddling west germany with east germany would hold it back for decades because of the difference in development . 
  it did . 
   relatively high speed limits . 
   somehow the other people in this thread doesnt agree with you . 
  btw : that should be '' ** do n't ** '' . 
   and i study in a university with 400 germans , and i * am * german . 
  so you speak a little german and can apparently decide if someone else speaks german ? 
   by your standard none of them can say they speak english since it wasnt perfect . 
  that 's not even what i said , you claimed his german and english is perfect . 
  dude , stop trolling , you 're bad at it . 
   on point : us informal extremely good , attractive , or stylish . 
   he made one mistake in 1 language , everyone else here are saying his german , italian , spanish and so on was on point . 
  you 're really forgetful , too . 
  apparently . 
  bad troll !, 
  what ? 
  you are the only one saying he 's perfect in all 32 languages .
