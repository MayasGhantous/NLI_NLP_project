  bad troll . 
  bad !, 
   he made one mistake in 1 language , everyone else here are saying his german , italian , spanish and so on was on point it 's really not . 
  his english is definitely not perfect and his german was very slow and . . off . 
  not perfect . 
  his english is n't that good , though . 
   why does the eagle have to go somewhere ? 
  `` bundesministerium '' makes it already as official as it gets , the eagle is nice and all , but not necessary for that . 
  you 've heard of seals ? 
   the once you frequently interact with ? 
  that 'd be ** none ** . 
  for normal people . 
  they have no reason at all to interact with a bundesministerium , ever . 
  no , it 's the fucking name of the legal entity , dude . 
  impossible . 
  well , * possible * , but the eagle has to go * somewhere * on the paper , so why not as the logo that it is anyway ? 
  and who 'd make the effort and memorize fourteen different logos ? 
  and none of those will * ever * interact with you , so what 's the point ? 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  and then there 's the bundespr\u00e4sident and the bundespr\u00e4sidialamt and the bundeskanzleramt , the bundesfinanzamt and probably at least a hundred other agencies that use the same logo as pictures in ops picture . 
  for gods sake , you must not change the federal eagle . 
  what 's wrong with you guys ? 
  it 's not supposed to be helpful , it 's the damn name of the damn legal entity . 
  pretty sure that describes what germany currently does ... 
  no , that is why you ** have ** to repeat it . 
  the department ie . 
  the ** legal entity ** is called '' ** bundesministerium ... ** '' . 
  if you skip the bundesministerium the legal acts would n't be valid . 
   it 's like writing `` deutsches bundesministerium '' . 
  they 're not called `` deutsches . . '' , so that 'd be stupid . 
  you 're saying that different departments at a company should have different logos instead of one . 
   for example is it really necessary to repeat `` bundesministerium '' in every logo ? 
  yes , of course . 
  that 's what the department is called . 
  like the germans ?

  tak for det. 
  i 'm also saying it was very understandable but it was very far from how danish people actually sound and from how i believe i sound , too . 
  well , i live in schleswig-holstein . 
  so , why not . 
  that 's much worse . 
  am german , sounded dutch to me . 
  coincidentally i thought it was very understandable . 
  me speaking danish at about b1/2 . 
  both is more than 5 % . 
  and before they 're at risk they 'll run nation-wide , they 've threatened that before . 
  what ? 
  i have no idea where that is coming from . 
  i was just wondering how it is possible to live without having at least one id ? 
  how are these people picking up parcels ? 
  sure , but * how * are people doing these things if they do n't have id ? 
  yeah , i did n't know about that full-time/honorary difference . 
  never lived somewhere that did n't have an oberb\u00fcrgermeister . 
  btw : * ma ** y ** or - b\u00fcrgermeister * ma ** j ** or - military officer, 
   ( like for picking a parcel at the post office you either need an id yeah , this alone . 
  how do the americans do that without ids ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the csu always got 5 % nation-wide . 
  5 % of 80 million is ... 4 million , how many people living in bavaria ? 
  12 million . 
  as long as the csu gets a third of the bavarian votes there 's not a problem and i do n't see that happening . 
   the majors are elected directly , are they ? 
  i thought only oberb\u00fcrgermeister would be elected directly . 
  americans ca n't get ids without a car because they ca n't get to the place that hands out ids without a car ( apparently uber does n't operate where those people live ) and it takes 2 hrs to get an id at those place and they only open during business hours . 
  although ... how are these car-less people getting to the voting booth ? 
  i guess it does n't matter if they do n't have an id then . 
  murica is fucked , man . 
  not sure about finland , but in germany everyone * must * have an id-card or a passport , it 's the law . 
  and why not ? 
  public transportations gets you everywhere and there 's no reason to take off work because ( in germany ) the city opens late on thursday until like 7pm . 
  id card costs like $ 25/10yrs , i fail to see the problem really . 
  that 's for a smallish city council . 
  so probably around 50-100 seats . 
   penchant for taxpayer funded palaces to be fair , it 's a glorious palace . 
  and the turks will be happy they have it in a hundred years . 
  not usually , no . 
  also , i like your username . 
  yeah , i guess that 's the best comparison . 
  just that in germany it 's on at 10pm and ( usually ) nobody is yelling and the guests are party leaders or secretaries and the like . 
  no , the sitting chancellor usually does not participate . 
  depends whether by swiss german you mean what swiss actually speak or what they speak when talking to germans ? 
  the last one is basically a strong dialect , actual swiss german is pretty difficult to understand , but i 'd say easier than dutch . 
   talk show just to add for americans : talk show meaning `` a show where politicians talk about politics with other politicians and a host '' . 
  i 'm actually not sure if that concept exists in the usa . 
  i should pretend a human right does not exist ? 
  how ? 
  why ? 
  even if its not a human right then still both guardians would need to agree upon the consent of the child . 
  same conclusion . 
   you seem to be under the impression that i 'm curious of what the law in germany is that is what we are talking about . 
   that i am disputing your interpretation of it . 
  i 'm not interpreting anything . 
   do you think it would be a bad thing if fathers were given the right to unilaterally test for paternity ? 
  given that the child has a human right to privacy the only correct answer is : yes , unless the mother agree too . 
  or the court agrees instead of the mother . 
  * that would require denying children access to the information who their father is . 
  * it would require to not give childs information to the father without consent of the child . 
  * child support laws would have to be changed . 
  * inheritance laws would have to be changed . 
  * custody laws would have to be changed .
