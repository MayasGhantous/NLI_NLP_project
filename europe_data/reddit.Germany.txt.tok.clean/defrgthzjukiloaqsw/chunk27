  * family laws would have to be changed . 
  not nearly worth the effort . 
  if they 're not necessary there would n't be a reason to make their lives easier , would there ? 
   bit condescending with the bold and capital . 
  on purpose , yeah . 
   i think it is a important distinction to make , that if we have a right to privacy is mainly to stop government from intruding in our lives and also strangers ( to a certain degree ) there 's your american thinking showing . 
   it is very important to keep in mind that this is not absolute and there are a lot of cases where privacy is reasonably suspended . 
  only with consent of the person . 
   you do n't suppose a parent ought to go to jail for looking into his daughter 's phone or entering her room without permission , now do you ? 
  i think a parent should * not * do either because that 's appalling behaviour . 
  and we are still talking about the * human right to privacy * . 
  not aware of any case that 's been brought , but the phone is the daughters property and the parent must not `` go through it '' by law '' . 
   i think what is lacking from you argument is a definition and consequently a limitation of what privacy means in this context and purpose does it serve . 
  it 's not my argument . 
  ** it 's the law !, 
  ** for gods sake people , why are we discussing this ? 
  you are n't even german . 
  [ here , read up on german privacy right ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/informationelle_selbstbestimmung ) . 
  [ less informative english article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/informational_self-determination ) . 
   power of attorney ? 
  given to someone . 
   next of kin ? 
  wife , husband ? 
  the opinion of the relative is only advisiory , they can not make actual decisions . 
  that 's precisely why germans ** have ** powers of attorneys made for other persons which are only useable in case of incapicatation of the granting person . 
  you are n't saying you do n't have that ? 
   medical board ? 
   i 'd be surprise if children where thought of having enough mental maturity for giving consent for any and all medical procedures . 
  ** they 're not !, 
  ** ** their guardians decide upon the consent of the child ** . 
   regardless , this is not a medical procedure . 
  so the point is moot . 
  i did n't say it has anything to do with a medical procedure . 
  you still need ** consent ** for your test . 
   because it 's better for society as whole if a certain demographic has its life made easier for not much effort . 
   well , this is just abusing the legal status of a child as a convinent tool for the mother . 
  it is . 
   there is no reason why a child would not consent to know who their real father is if we wanted to compe up with a lot of reasons . 
  one obvious would be that currently the child is on eits way to inherit billions from bill gates . 
  the child would object 100 % to any tests for fear of actually having a much poorer father . 
   there is no reason to deny a man certainty . 
  human right to privavy beats understandable demand from potential father . 
   withholding the information who the real father is , is a bigger violation of the childrens rights by far . 
  it 's only be a violation of baby rights if the baby * would n't want it that way * . 
  and until it 's of age that decision lies in the guardians . 
  you keep implying that sperm donors are neceessary . 
  ** childs privacy ** . 
  if the child does not consent to the test ** then it did not consent ** . 
  if the guardian of the childs do n't consent in lieu of the child then there is no test . 
  it 's that easy !, 
  and even if you would do an illegal test it would n't help you because that 's not valid in court and no reason to get a court-valid test by order of the court . 
  yes , there 's precedence . 
  you ca n't just go around and demand dna-tests from random people . 
  child support ? 
  the man is married to the women in this example . 
  there is no child support involved . 
  why would i want to make the lives of sperm donors easier ? 
  that would imply we need them and i see no reason to need them . 
  again : ** privacy ** . 
  it 's a thing . 
  actually it 's a human right in germany . 
  seriously . 
   the child 's privacy is something that you just made up . 
  no , it 's fucking german law i 'm explaning to you . 
   children do n't need to consent to medical procedures , ** yes , they do !, 
  ** everyone does !, 
  are you nuts ? 
  did the child ask anyone who its father is ? 
  no , it did not . 
  a man wants to know . 
  the child has to consent . 
  the child does not consent if ** both ** guardians do n't agree . 
  ** the child is consenting or not ** . 
  the guardians just have power of attorney . 
  if there 's no reason to change something i tend to prefer doing nothing . 
  i see no reason to do that . 
  [ i do n't understand the relevance of the question . 
  did n't say that , did i ? 
  that implies we need sperm donors . 
  you are not listening . 
  this is about ** the childs privacy ** and ** the child ** has to consent . 
  the child obviously ca n't do that and therefore the decision of whether ** the child consents ** falls to its guardians . 
  it 's not . 
  the guardians have to decide on the consent because the child can not . 
  the mother is against it -  no consent . 
  that 's the problem here . 
    ** childs privacy . 
  yes , the consent of the child being the one needed here . 
   it is ridiculous to claim this protects a `` woman 's privacy '' nobody is claiming that . 
  it protects ** the childs ** privacy . 
  the child has to consent to the test , because it can not do that its guardians have to decide on the test . 
  so if one of two guardians is against the test ** the child ** does not consent . 
   but yeah , we need to change a couple laws to make donorship safer from a financial point of view . 
  no , we do n't . 
   why is someone insane , who tries to enhance the chance that his genes survive ? 
  child support ? 
  inheritance issues ? 
  correct . 
  and what 's your point ? 
   you taught us democracy , freedom of speech , equality and liberty .
