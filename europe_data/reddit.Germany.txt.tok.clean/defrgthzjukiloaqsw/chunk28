   you gave us david hasselhoff , one of the greatest actors and singers there 'll ever be . 
   you brought us the mcrib , windows me , type ii-diabetes and the great bill cosby ,  america , so inspiring ,  your soon-to-be foresightful foreign policy !, 
  you actually believe that most americans would instantly identify this as irony ? 
  i do n't believe the intention was to write a song that trump supporters would like . 
  except that it really is not obvious . 
   you taught us democracy , freedom of speech , equality and liberty .

  you actually believe that most americans would instantly identify this as irony ? 
  except that it 's not . 
  you are n't trying to watch the video from the viewpoint of an american . 
   do you mean satire ? 
  why would you assume that ? 
  irony and satire are not two of the same thing . 
  irony is * used * in satire . 
   this video is exaggeration to a comical degree so as to be obvious . 
  but it 's not . 
  none of that is actually over the top to american trump supporters . 
  actually much of that is n't exaggerated in any way and `` grab 'em by the pussy '' can honestly be used as a completely normal motivational statement . 
  like when your american football team leaves the locker room e.g. 
  `` grab 'em by the pussy !, 
  [ and win the game ] yeah ! '' . 
   irony needs an immediate logical expression to counter the statement ... so like a list of things you do n't like about lists . 
  you 'd think someone that hates lists would n't write a list . 
  why ? 
   [ jane austen 's pride and prejudice begins with the proposition `` it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . '', 
  in fact , it soon becomes clear that austen means the opposite : women ( or their mothers ) are always in search of , and desperately on the lookout for , a rich single man to make a husband . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irony#comic_irony ) you do n't * have * to give a counterstatement and most certainly not immediately . 
   edit : not trying to insult you . 
  i have just found lately that there are many parts of comedy that are n't translated well , and i would like to learn if i am missing something that is n't actually obvious . 
  i 'm even more confused now , where is translation involved here ? 
   irony : [ the expression of one 's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite , typically for humorous or emphatic effect . 
  ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/irony ), 
  yeah , that song really missed the mark . 
  i would n't be too surprised if it 's played at a trump rally as a kind of motivational entrance music . 
  actually i think it 's too subtle . 
  actually the ( apparently ) intended irony is not obvious at all . 
  there 's no proof of them finishing yet ... 
  for gods sake , it 's not optional . 
  or do what the australians do . 
   well , we ca n't stop them from coming to europe , unless you are proposing to sink their bots sink a few boats to prevent a lot of boats later . 
  or do what the australians do . 
    so let 's build ten elbphilharmonien and give ursula $ 10b to solve the problem . 
   i am not sure about your obsession with the elbphilhamornie but that 's enough . 
  are $ 10b really enough ? 
  i 'd actually think it takes more . 
  we could also build several airports if you prefer . 
   have a job hilarious . 
  good one !, 
  they 'll never get a residence permit anyway because they 'll all go home . 
  that 's the point of being a refugee . 
  you go someplace safe and ** return home ** later . 
   then more refugees will come , which we would have to take in , we do n't * have * to . 
  that 's what borders are for , you know ? 
   since you ca n't just drop syrian refugees via parachute back in their country , can you ? 
  who say we ca n't ? 
  unfortunately we ca n't once they are here , but we do n't have to let them im . 
   well , if you are no spending any money to fight the causes of the crisis , so let 's build ten elbphilharmonien and give ursula $ 10b to solve the problem . 
  where is the plus-side here ? 
  why would they leave germany ? 
  good joke . 
  but thankfully they 'll not be in germany once they are old enough for pension . 
   qualifying refugees sure is pointless . 
   raising hartz-4 to levels allowing a reasonable life no raise necessary to do that . 
  so we actually * did * 20 billion on the refugee problem . 
  i 'd have preferred spending $ 20b on infrastructer . 
  hell , let 's build * twenty * elbphilharmonien all over the country . 
  and now west germany is in need of a soli . 
   for lowering some taxes . 
  $ 20b is how much less tax ? 
  who cares ? 
   if we do n't improve our infrastructure soon then those numbers wo n't last long . 
  about time west-germany gets some infrastructure money . 
  however ... it takes forever to spend it . 
  changing 60km of autobahn from 2 lanes each way to 3 ? 
  ** four years ** . 
  ridiculous . 
  how about we trade ? 
  helgoland for mallorca ? 
  so how did that other purchase of ours work out since 1990 ? 
   what is more important it 's one in five hundred , so one particular power plant `` blows up '' on average every 20 * 500 = 10,000 years . 
  but * if * it blows up near you it 's quite catastrophic . 
   if you live near nuclear power plant you could be exposed to the danger , which will most likely comparable to getting a ct scan , every 10,000 years . 
  did n't know you were delusional . 
  no , it 's irrelevant . 
   why does france has one of the cheapest electricity prices in europe before taxation then ? 
  because the french states pays a lot of costs obviously . 
    that great source of energy that already poisoned north europe in 1986 ? 
   how about actual statistics of deaths per twh ? 
  i do n't care because that 's completely missing the point . 
   great source of energy that great source of energy that already poisoned north europe in 1986 ? 
  yes , yes , we do n't have any of that reactor type left and ours * should n't * release any even if things go wrong . 
  but it 's still possible . 
  actually happened in fukushima , though . 
  and it 's not even cheap anyway , as you can read in that other comment . 
  that 's not the issue . 
  nobody was ever scared of radioactivity released by functioning nuclear plants . 
  dude , i 'm eating here . 
  please put a trigger warning on that i nearly gagged . 
  danish dynamite !,
