   now , personally i believe that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment , but i fail to see what basis you can establish your idea that the supreme court declining to strike down death penalty laws would be political , but the supreme court striking down those laws would not be political . 
  because to decide one way it would have to ignore the constitution and to decide the other way it would have to just do the job it 's supposed to do : enforce the constitution . 
  whenever it refuses to do its job that 's political . 
  those are just decisions that necessarily follow the `` all people are equal '' clause that has been in the constitution since forever . 
  what was political was to ignore that clause until it was n't no longer politically convenient to do so . 
  americans like to believe they are the only free society in the world and love to speak in superlatives , he really did mean his own scotus . 
  you missed where scotus actually ruled that `` the case ** did not involve a `` political question '' beyond the federal courts ' power to decide ** and returned the case to an appeals court . '', 
  which means that scotus believes that federal courts have powers to make political decisions . 
  and i did give a couple of examples where scotus ** did ** make political decisions . 
  where it ignored the letter of the constitution because it wanted to . 
  if it would n't make political decisions all the time you would already have a ninth justice again and would n't have to wait for next year to get a replacement for scalia . 
  of course i was n't . 
  the way he wrote it :  judicial independence in constutional matters is the greatest safeguard of a free society . 
  * strongly * implies he was talking about his own system . 
   a lot of people thought legalizing gay marriage was judicial activism . 
  well , no , that just recognized what was written in the contitution all the time . 
   uh , bush v. gore was arguably political , what else was in your opinion ? 
  you still allow cruel and unusual punishment for example . 
  and it 's not just the death penalty . 
  well , obviously not unusual because you are doing it all the time , but cruel nonetheless . 
  citizens united from the tip of my tongue and that other one that claims corporations can have religions and of course these :  the court decided in glossip v. gross that states may use a drug linked to apparently botched executions to carry out death sentences . 
   in 2008 , the supreme court ruled that a combination of chemicals then in widespread use did not violate the constitution 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment . 
  failure to abolish death penalty for political reasons . 
  in zivotofsky v. kerry it , apparently , actually ruled `` that the case did not involve a `` political question '' beyond the federal courts ' power to decide and returned the case to an appeals court . 
  '' , so apparently scotus actually believes it is entitled to make political decisions . 
  that 's all i could find on the wsj `` best of 2015 '' page , i 'm sure there 's more . 
   your country does n't have to have the best record at something for you to recognize the value in it . 
  sure , but an american attorney claiming the aforementioned claim is a bit ridiculous . 
   of course , but someone has to be the final arbiter . 
  the point is it should n't make * political * decisions . 
  our german constitutional court does n't do that . 
   i 'm not saying polish courts have to end segregation or legalize gay marriage , yeah , those are n't political decisions . 
  but scotus is making political decisions all the time ... 
  why does n't the court publish it ? 
  are courts and government not separated in poland ? 
   do they think they ca n't work in the us for example as well ? 
  or that americans ca n't work in europe ? 
  they ca n't . 
  and neither can i work in the usa . 
  in germany you can just get two german passports for that purpose , that is n't possible in either ireland or britain ? 
   accroding to your interpretation , the `` rule of law '' means that no one ever breaks the law no , that is actually * your * interpretation . 
   and what 's in practice a temporal residence , followed by another a temporal residence , followed by another a temporal residence ... until the person has been in the country long enough to seek a citizenship ? 
  the last part does n't happen for refugees obviously . 
   the remaining handful must have been reproducing like rabbits then , since some 380,000 live outside of kosovo , most in germany and switzerland . 
  [ 32k kosovar in germany in 2008 , 84k in 2009 , 100k in 2010 and 180k in 2014 . 
  quite a bit , maybe they are refugees again ? 
  ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesellschaftstaat/bevoelkerung/migrationintegration/auslaendischebevolkerung/tabellen/staatsangehoerigkeitjahre.html;jsessionid=07a7ac267b8711d4aaf2458566c14df1.cae4 )  yeah , they will chose to go back instead of continuing to live in a non-shithole country with free everything and more than 1st class citizen rights . 
  ** it 's not their choice ** . 
  the kosovar did n't want to leave either , we hade a huge debate back when it was time for them to leave . 
   what is then the difference in asylum vs. refugee status on germany ? 
  asylum gets you permanent residency , eventually . 
   i do n't understand why you want to believe that . 
  because it 's true . 
   balkan war refugees were n't coming in millions eh ? 
  yeah , they did . 
  google tells me that germany alone took in 350k kosovo-refugees . 
  nearly all obviously went home . 
   balkan war refugees were n't coming in millions and their countries were not total shitholes , but i do n't think they generally all returned since considerable populations have remained in the countries that took them . 
  not sure if you realize that it 's not their choice . 
   go check some statistics of decisions . 
  it is not `` miniscule '' amount who get asulym , it is the majority of positive decisions . 
  you are conflating actual asylum and refugee status . 
  asylum , in germany , is only available for ** politically persecuted ** . 
   -  page 7 , 3rd column : http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201601-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile exactly . 
  only ** .3 percent ** got asylum . 
  it 's there one page seven ** second column ** . 
   how many of those middle-easteners or north africans who came 10 years or so ago have returned ? 
  hint : populations with aforementioned origins in europe just somehow have kept growing . 
  the kosovar left . 
  as will all the syrians . 
   an actual asulym is pretty much permanent . 
  is n't it great that only a very miniscule amount of them is here because of political persecution ? 
  only those will get asylum and nobody minds . 
   if a temporal permit instead , then it is usuallly followed by new temporal permit until they 've been enough time in the country to seek a citizenship . 
  no idea how this specifically works in germany , but generally . 
  war refugees obviously do n't get permanent residency , that 's the whole point of letting them in . 
  they have no choice , they are not getting permanent residency . 
  it 's still too fucking expensive to house them for ten years . 
  everyone who keeps calling them `` refugees '' does obviously believe that . 
  i do n't . 
   why are they fleeing the place where they were before austria ? 
  irrelevant . 
  once they enter germany there are fleeing from austria . 
  is there war in austria or is there not ? 
  the obvious point here being that they are ** not ** fleeing from war if they walk to germany from austria . 
   i ca n't put it into more candid terms than `` that 's not true '' . 
  your delusion does not make it untrue , because it is actually very true . 
  they have absolutely no right to enter germany without having a visum . 
  and they have absolutely no right to apply for asylum if not in germany . 
  and have absolutely no right to get a visum . 
   and i do n't really get what you 're trying to say about our laws , are you suggesting that we simply do n't give them the opportunity to apply for asylum once they reach our border ? 
  because that is most certainly against our laws . 
  no , it 's not . 
  they have absolutely no right to enter germany without having a visum . 
  and they have absolutely no right to apply for asylum ** if not in germany ** . 
  and have absolutely no right to get a visum . 
  so obviously we should not let them inside in the first place . 
   i never said nor implied that i `` want to let in four milliong more hartzers '' , do n't put words in my mouth . 
  of course you do , you demand us to accept four million migrants . 
  you want to let in four million more hartzers .
