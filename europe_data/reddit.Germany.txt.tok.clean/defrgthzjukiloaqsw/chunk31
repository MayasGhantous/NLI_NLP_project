   well , link me to a statement of merkel that was an `` invitation '' . 
  you will not find a statement that reads `` syrians of the world , come to germany '' only because you want to pretend she did n't . 
   not really , no . 
  yes , really , yes . 
  it seems we agree in principle . 
  i 'm just saying it does n't make sense to hire x judges now only to lay off half of them in three years . 
  and you know everyone of them will sue . 
   only in theory . 
  in practice , even germany would not have provided enough funding in the region to take care of everyone . 
  so what ? 
   and we are curretnly the country spending the most in the region . 
  it really is according to the saying : `` aus den augen , aus dem sinn '' here . 
  yeeees . 
    of course it 's an option . 
  the one that should have been used after the first couple hundred thousand at least . 
  and merkel should n't have invited everyone in the first place . 
   sorry , there was no explicit invitation . 
  of course there was and that 's why everybody started coming . 
  stop pretending there was none . 
    well , again another reason merkel should have thought about before , right ? 
   debatable . 
  no , fact . 
   and no , i would simply select them on their qualification , not based on the date of their graduation . 
  who said anything about the date ? 
  obviously selection would be based on the grades of those that apply . 
  but why would you hire someone who has been working as a lawyer for five or ten years ? 
   there is a downwards trend in the qualifcations anyways - so accepting people with grades 8 +9 or 9 +8 would n't break the system . 
  of course not , i was actually under the assumption that 8 +8 would already be enough . 
  but it 's still a fact that if you hire more graduates you will be hiring from lower scores . 
    obviously you do n't want to close the border ever . 
   why is that obvious , i stated the the opposite . 
  no , you are saying you want to keep it open . 
    have you seen what they are doing in calais ? 
   are they shooting enough people ? 
  i can see it how it turns you on . 
  i meant the migrants . 
  the police is obviously not doing enough and one would only have to shoot people who were trying to get into the country to stop them from doing that until they stop trying . 
  today the official term is `` richter auf probe '' , everyone who completed both staatsexamen can call oneself assessor . 
  and if they are n't either judge or lawyer they do . 
  you actually intend to keep them . 
  but you are correct that one could hire x number of increasingly bad candidates to become inexperienced judges presiding over these cases . 
  i 'm sure that 'll not result in a lot of appeals , are n't you ? 
  i 'm assuming you 'd only hire new graduates , right ? 
  because hiring failing lawyers whose firm does n't make at least as much profit as what being an r1 judge pays do n't seem like judge material to me . 
    irrelevant . 
  could also have been dealt with by paying for camps elsewhere . 
   nope . 
  this does n't make the reason any less valid . 
  if you say so , but it would * solve * the problem . 
    i said we should n't have let them in in the first place !, 
   you asked for the reason why we we accepted them . 
  i did not . 
   closing the border completely is n't exactly an option for us . 
  so there will always be people coming in . 
  of course it 's an option . 
  the one that should have been used after the first couple hundred thousand at least . 
  and merkel should n't have invited everyone in the first place . 
    of course we can , turkey is perfectly save . 
   in regards to turkey , it 's the lack of a treaty allowing us to send back people preventing that . 
  well , again another reason merkel should have thought about * before * , right ? 
    oh gee , i 'm sure they do n't want to live in berlin . 
  and if they ca n't find something people like you will complain about living conditions . 
  exactly . 
   at his point i dont want to argue with you anymore as some of your statements show me that you are not interested in understanding what actually happened at this weekend but spreading your opinion which i can not agree with . 
  i know what happened , what is written in that article is accurate . 
  you ca n't differentiate between `` hey , those 15,000 in hungary may come over '' and what followed ** after ** that decision , namely another ** million ** more . 
   also , your fantasies of `` huge trucks '' , `` helicopters '' and `` shooting people '' reveal your lack of knowledge of how to protect a border and a severe resentment towards the values of our consitution , the rule of law and the lack of basic understanding of the principle of proportionality . 
  that is exactly how you close a border . 
  obviously you do n't want to close the border ever . 
  or do you actually believe a sign would suffice ? 
  would `` sorry , we 're full , go somewhere else . '', 
  cause more refugees to turn back at our borders or not ? 
  have you seen what they are doing in calais ? 
  they wo n't be stopped unless by physical means . 
  thankfully the hungarian fence is finished or we 'd still be drowning in new migrants every day . 
  totally , yeah . 
   it is possible for judges to switch the `` branch '' . 
  so we could `` use '' some of them in the vgs and switch them to other courts later on . 
  not against their will you could n't . 
  kind of an obvious point of being a judge . 
   two reasons : first of all the humanitarian cause , irrelevant . 
  could also have been dealt with by paying for camps elsewhere . 
   secondly the factual reality of us not being able to deport people to hungary , greece , turkey or the coutnry of origin , as i already said . 
  ** i ** said we should n't have let them in in the first place !, 
    we did n't send them back , did we . 
   that is kind of the point . 
  we did not send them back because we could n't . 
  of course we can , turkey is perfectly save . 
    we barely have any apartments left for them or our own poor people to live in , but we are doing fine . 
  totally . 
   it always depends on where you look . 
  of course , that space is very limited in the big , popular cities . 
  oh gee , i 'm sure they do n't want to live in berlin . 
  and if they ca n't find something people like you will complain about living conditions . 
   again , the only thing i say is that in this particular moment there was no decision but there was a decision . 
  the people were still * in turkey * when merkel made that decision and only started moving after that . 
  nobody would 've cared if we 'd only accept 50,000 stuck in hungary or whereever . 
   again , even if you would have supported the events that would have happened when closing the borders , you can not deny the fact that in this particluar moment it was not possible to stop anyone . 
  i do not say you can not close borders , i just say you could not have done this within the time that was left . 
  of course you could have closed that border .
