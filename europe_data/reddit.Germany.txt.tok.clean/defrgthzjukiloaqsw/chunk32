  that 's * very * easy . 
  it obviously involves weapons and the military of course if you need it done fast . 
   there was no decision yes , there was . 
   this was one of the few cases where you really had no choice , you had to let them in as they already had been on their way . 
  we * had * to let them in because * they were on their way * ? 
  that 's a nonsensical statement . 
  unless they would have already been in germany we could still have said `` no . '' . 
   not only was there nobody to stop them , if you had done so you would have risked conflicts and violations against human rights happening at germany \u00b4 s doorstep . 
  closing of borders is not violating anyones right . 
  so what happens if you apply for a building permit and never hear back from whoever decides on that in slovakia ? 
  no , we ca n't because that demand is * temporary and extraordinary * and after it 's gone we 'd have too many judges . 
   some of our courts are understaffed anyways . 
  obviously , but verwaltungsgerichte are usually not , are they ? 
   do you have maximal waiting time for institutions ? 
  of course , do n't you ? 
  how else would that work ? 
  your state can just never decide and you could n't force it ? 
   i know about the availablity of people with law degrees qualified to be a judge . 
  and trust me , it is sufficient . 
  they wo n't work for tv\u00d6d 8 , though , so their availability is irrelevant . 
   countries have no obligations to accept refugees that have already passed a safe country . 
  and yet we do for no reason . 
   you are wrong . 
  we did not ` ignore ' the dublin agreement . 
  dublin iii included specific provisions allowing us to accept asylum seekers anyways . 
  not even talking about factual and legal realities that prevented us from sending people back to hungary , greece , turkey or the country of origin . 
  we did n't send them back , did we . 
   we are doing fine , thanks . 
  this is not about `` not being able to handle the amount '' . 
  we barely have any apartments left for them or our own poor people to live in , but we are doing fine . 
  totally . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
   the mass sexual assault is happening in the asylum centres . 
  but why would germans care about that ? 
   they are suing for status so their family can come to germany so they get more money and bigger apartments . 
  it was n't enough in turkey , why would it be enough in germany . 
   yes , i do believe that . 
  the factor limiting the number of judges has always been the state funding , not the number of qualified and willing lawyers willing to become a judge . 
  we have a decent pool to recruit people from . 
  it is just a matter of will and funding . 
  we ca n't hire more judges just because we need them for two years of extraordinary demand . 
   the asylum conditions are absolutely disgusting in germany . 
  okay , you have to be trolling . 
   prostitution is rampant it 's legal here , so why would we object if women want to prostitute themselves ? 
   the people are stored like battery chickens you nuts ? 
  we 're paying out of all our noses to provide perfect accomodation and there 's basically no one left living in non-permanent lodging . 
  i never even said that i would n't do exactly the same if i were a young able-bodied syrian that was invited to come to germany . 
  i 'm saying we should n't have let them in . 
  in germany you can sue for inaction after the state did n't decide within three months , generally . 
  i 'm not sure if that term is longer in these particular cases , but i see nothing wrong if they 're suing after a full year . 
   and whats even the point in suing when there is already a law in place that clearly states when family is allowed to come over ? 
  serious question , because i really dont understand it . 
  assuming that the state agency would always reach the same conclusion as the court this only makes sense if the court is expected to finish faster . 
  neither . 
  the brits got really offended when the court told them that it 's not okay to remove voting rights from prisoners . 
  one might argue that bad prison conditions and removal of voting rights from inmates/convicts may qualify as torture . 
   the british and irish governments are n't the only parties to the gfa , you do n't seem to grasp that there 's a couple of ni parties who signed it , yeah . 
  but that 's it . 
  the gfa was * not * signed by any other country . 
   it 's not simply a matter of the british and irish governments agreeing to a change , it is , no other party signed the gfa . 
   [ the british government committed to incorporate the european convention of human rights ( echr ) into the law of northern ireland and to the establishment of a northern ireland human rights commission . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_friday_agreement ) so the uk could actually repeal echr everywhere else . 
  and does n't even have to be a signatory , it just has to copy echr into northern irish law . 
  you 're still wrong , so why are you replying ? 
  tegels license runs out six months after ber opened , whenever that is . 
  exactly . 
  facebook obviously . 
  what the hell kind of question is this ? 
  i know , it 's not enough . 
  you must be trolling . 
  ** this is target the publication ** . 
   but what you are arguing is `` guilty until proven innocent '' in the regard that the news must be taken down from facebook before any determination is made by a court of law . 
  that 's a fucking lie . 
  for fucks sake . 
  this is n't hard to understand . 
  * hey facebook , $ shit is fake . 
  take it down . 
  * facebook : nah , looks real to me . 
  sometime later the courts either decide it 's fake or not and if it was n't fake facebook wo n't get fined obvious.y  is facebook compensated or otherwise for the actions the government took against it ? 
  are you fucking nuts ? 
  facebook did n't incur any damages . 
  there is no fucking criminal proceeding here . 
  that 's idiotic . 
  once facebook is informed about such a story they 'll look at it and take it down if it looks fake . 
  case closed . 
  ** obviously ** . 
  as always in these thread the answer is : in the end : ** the fucking courts ** . 
  how the fuck is this not fucking obvious . 
  yeah , but nobody has the right to ** lie ** about things or other people . 
   can you really , though ? 
  i do n't doubt it , but it would mean this should be a non-issue . 
  of course i can , why would n't i be able to do this ? 
   now , i 'm not too familiar with german law , but most of western europe sort of have the same laws , so is n't this something you can do only if it is about you , or affects you ? 
  yes , and ? 
  freedom of press does not allow the press to publish known wrong information . 
  publishing demonstrably fake information is already illegal in germany . 
   that just means they want to pass a law requiring facebook to remove these stories . 
  still does in germany . 
  actually fully licensed television programs are * required * to broadcast factual news . 
  and ?
