  if it 's true there 's no problem . 
  is this a joke question ? 
  per year . 
   facebook owns what 's app and any data you put into what 's app . 
  that 's like 500 % wrong . 
  at least . 
   serving you an ad based on computer analysis of your likes is so far from violating `` human rights '' that it starts to make the term sound silly . 
  oh , you are one of the special people then . 
   if anything , facebook has a `` human right '' to do what it wishes with the data you input into its services . 
  if you do n't like it , stop using it like many people i know . 
  yup , you are . 
  just substitute `` gun '' everywhere you read `` privacy '' and you * should * get it . 
  musk . 
   also having a hero in such a story and acknowledge this with words and actions brightens up that whole mess for everyone . 
  fair enough . 
  as if that does n't happen to thousands every day . 
  also : truck driver should have life insurance . 
  and even if it 's the account of the family . 
  why exactly are people sending them money ? 
   for ~ ~ dutch ~ ~ people the full iban you fill in would be : ftfy, 
  * parties are very expensive . 
  * but the mortals party hard , too !, 
  * yeah , sure , but they got aldi . 
  * wow , aldi is effing cheap . 
  party on !, 
  seriously , that 's the message . 
  i 'm guessing they split germany by population . 
  and the split took place before reunification anyway . 
  [ and what a glorious commercial it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqy6oysscgq ) . 
  ah , i see , bullshit , of course . 
   the eu 's schedules will also need to change because of brexit why ? 
   i 'm pretty sure people who moved west left their country . 
  there were german minorities in czechoslovakia , i.e. 
  germans in other countries . 
  still germans . 
  if you find any german minorites in libya or syria send them over , we 'll take care of them . 
   why should america and france and the ussr and g.b. 
  have helped them ? 
  they did n't ? 
   why should n't we have just let the germans there die ? 
  you killed quite a lot . 
   why should we have expended our resources helping and protecting them ? 
  you ... did n't ? 
   christ , especially us americans . 
  we 're on the other side of the ocean . 
  why should we care if germany gets gutted ? 
  but you did n't . 
   and , as for turkey , the issue 's that people are basically being held in detainment camps , so they 're not actually recieving much help . 
  food and shelter and medicine and schooling . 
  what else is there ? 
   you say let them stay home , so i say why do you want syrian children to die ? 
  i do n't care if they die or not . 
  go pick up a history book on your way out , hmkay . 
   no , i think they 're people , i 'm pretty sure they 're people . 
  was that in dispute somewhere ? 
   and i do n't think children should be left in warzones . 
  sure , why not . 
  but irrelevant to this discussion . 
  i literally already told you that i 'm fine with them staying in camps in turkey . 
   i do n't think adults should be either . 
  because it 's not about what they can do for me . 
  their basic humanity is enough reason to save someone . 
  you totally missed the point of them living in camps in turkey . 
   and ? 
  what do you care ? 
  it was n't too long ago germans were fleeing the red army . 
  nearly all the germans in czechoslovakia and poland were ethnically cleansed . 
  that implies they all died , which is n't true . 
  millions of them moved west as refugees , ** but never left their own country ** . 
   or maybe russia will invade germany while the u.s.a sits on ours asses and lets the russians have their way with you . 
  the red army was pretty nasty last time they came through . 
  as if we 'd need the usa to beat the russians , you 're ridiculous . 
  if you look them so much invite them to the usa . 
   idk man , those camps sound pretty horrific considering people ca n't work and have no hope of it for years . 
  and ? 
  what do i care ? 
  they 're free to stay home . 
   it sounds like you just do n't want people from the mid-east in europe . 
  that was n't hidden in any way , of course i do n't . 
  and neither do you want them in the usa . 
  even thoughyou actually seem to have uses for illiterate people without any skills . 
   if there is deception is has nothing to do with `` the numbers that are falling are those of new refugees '' since that was extremely very clear . 
  no , the deception is that the articles headline was trying to imply that ** the numbers of refuges are falling ** . 
  which they are not . 
    this would be where `` my english is better than yours '' comes in . 
   apparently , the better your english is , the more there 's really no more evidence needed . 
  and you still do n't understand any of this even though it 's been explained several times . 
   strange , because i was n't deceived . 
  they seem like perfectly clear sentences to me . 
  this would be where `` my english is better than yours '' comes in . 
   maybe when i master english the way you have , i will also be confused by words like `` new '' . 
  dude , seriously . 
  the deceptive word is '' ** despite ** '' , as you 've been told many times . 
  i would rather they stay in camps in turkey , of course . 
  once they 've left those they were n't refugees anymore but illegal economic migrants . 
  well , obviously my english is better than yours , because it actually is deceptive . 
  and that 's because that is the way the writer wanted it to be . 
  why would anyone believe that ? 
   what i 'm saying is the problem was the number of people coming in was the problem because it was overwhelming the system set up to help refugees . 
  but that was not the problem .
