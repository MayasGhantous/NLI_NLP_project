   the lower numbers of people should be a good thing because it takes some of the pressure off the system . 
  it 's a very bad thing ** because there 's still refugees coming in ** . 
   the people - the refugees themselves - are the problem as much as the sheer number of them is . 
  that number ** increased ** . 
   you asked a rethoric question , you did n't say anything . 
  during your further studies you 'll notice that rethoric questions are used * to say something * . 
   saving human lives is never stupid , unless you believe they have no inherent worth , of course it was stupid . 
  it threatens * our * way of life in the future . 
   in which case you would n't keep exercising basic survival functions like breathing . 
  someone who does n't believe in inherent worth of life would n't keep breathing on his own ? 
  that 's idiotic . 
  one does n't have to believe in such an inherent worth to keep living the life one does . 
   this is histrionic to the extreme . 
  you use big words without knowing what they mean . 
   [ histrionic personality disorder ( hpd ) is defined by the american psychiatric association as a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of excessive attention-seeking emotions , usually beginning in early adulthood , including inappropriately seductive behavior and an excessive need for approval . 
  histrionic people are lively , dramatic , vivacious , enthusiastic , and flirtatious . 
  i feel like that is exactly what i said . 
  it was stupid . 
  we saved them only to get invaded by them later on . 
  why would they ? 
  they are supposed to live in the german way of live , that 's what integration means . 
  he 's correct though . 
  what has foreign aid accomplished besides a vastly overpopulated continent ? 
   the majority of those migrants would be innocent victims of circumstance . 
   do you really think europe will get that extreme , before half of europe is already overrun in a self-propagating wave of migration ? 
  what 's the alternative ? 
  we should n't have let the last batch of immigrants and i doubt we 'll make such a mistake again . 
  i really do n't get what you mean . 
  a million came and they 're a problem . 
  they do n't suddenly stop being a problem a week after they got here , do they ? 
  the point is that the `` despite '' in the first quote is incredibly wrong . 
  if there is less newcomes than last year that does n't mean the problem of refugees and integration is smaller . 
  in fact it increased by 305,000 people in 2016 . 
  dude , it 's ** 6th ** grade . 
  why would that be relevant to anyone ever ? 
  until one is 18 actually . 
  yes , seriously . 
  if you leave hauptschule after 9th grade you have to go to vocation school until you 're 18 . 
  in most states at least . 
  those are our federal constitutional court judges , our judges of other federal highest court [ look like this ] ( https://www.allmystery.de/i/t993306_richter.jpg ) . 
  and all the other judges wear black robes instead , but look like the ones in this picture . 
  i do n't believe anyone was ever held back because of a 6 in sports . 
   probably wo n't be the end of the world , but still - in my view - unneccessary . 
  of course it 's unnecessary , but it 's * her * choice . 
   or at least having a 6 will be a huge hit to your grades , so it is n't that trivial . 
  why would your sports grade when you were twelve years old be relevant to anything ever ? 
  which is the dumbest idea ever . 
  and you believe that 's different in civil law countries ? 
   personally i would n't give a shit if my child married any of the people of the mentioned groups , so i would answer 5 or 6 which most people would interpret as `` uncomfortable '' on this map despite me being indifferent about it . 
  but then you answered the wrong way . 
  if you do n't care whom your child marries then your answer should be `` 10 '' . 
  it is . 
  the word you 're looking for is `` depreciation '' . 
  would n't have expected that / r/vexillology is full of ... non-knowledgeable people . 
  yes , ducal . 
  [ what 's wrong with pompous ? 
  that 's far from empty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_mecklenburg ) . 
   this building looks like a library well , the constitutional court has a big library . 
  this actually is a cultural difference . 
  we prefer out cities pretty , even if it costs more . 
  your reply makes no sense whatsoever . 
  the uk is n't * buying * anything with that money . 
  it 's just paying what it ** already bought ** . 
  if it refuses to do that then we wo n't sell anything , tough luck . 
  it does n't make sense to talk about anything if the uk does n't agrees to the amount to be paid * first * . 
  why talk about anything only to cancel * everything * just because the uk wo n't pay ? 
  but nobody is surprised if she does n't want to pay . 
   that means that not only can we still match eu subsidies but you 're not going to do that . 
  they 've gone completely mad , have they ? 
  well , he got a bit too angry . 
  you do n't see that it 's fugly ? 
  because there are no reasons to keep shops open . 
  i told you many times . 
  it looked like you were against the methods used in that video . 
  what 's the point here ? 
  the riot stopped , did n't it ? 
  police trying to arrest criminals -  criminals destroy anything they can find -  police is to blame . 
  yeah . . makes total sense . 
   of course it is n't . 
  it was a rhetoric question . 
  because it 's obvious . 
   does n't even touch on the fact that the danish train tracks is part of the only train route from germany to sweden or norway , and thus the domestic distance is irrelevant in the larger picture . 
  yes , cargo trains are indeed known for going 300kph . 
  and they 'll change to the fehmarn-route anyway in the near enough future . 
   besides . 
  it takes 3 1/2 hour for dsb to drive 300 km today . 
  i 'll let you figure out if you believe that to be anywhere near 180 km/h ... you do n't realize that the trains are stopping sometimes ? 
   why should it take a long time to get anywhere because the country is `` smaller '' than other countries ? 
  because covering 100km in a 200kph train takes half an hour , while a 300kph train takes 20 minutes for the same time costing * five * ( number made up ) times more . 
  it 's not cost effective . 
  is n't that obious ? 
  because denmark is pretty small ? 
  are you under the impression that i do n't like danish trains ? 
  danish trains are doing 180kph , though . 
  that 's plenty for denmark . 
  will someone please remove the < 200km/h lines ? 
  that 's not high-speed . 
  it helps if you include slow 160km/h lines for no reason . 
  what 's the threat here ? 
   she was the first president of the elected european parliament .
