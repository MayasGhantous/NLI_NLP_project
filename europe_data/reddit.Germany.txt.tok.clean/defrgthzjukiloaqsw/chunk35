  i read the link , yes . 
  but if that 's enough we 'll have to give one to all ep presidents . 
  and i honestly literally never heard of her . 
  on that note : when i visited stockholm i barely saw swedish people . 
  i see . 
  does n't seem that important to the eu . 
   simone veil who ? 
  essentially . 
  because it makes no difference to them . 
  that is what i said , yes . 
  that is what i said , yes . 
   hey could n't adopt children ** jointly ** . 
  one of them could adopt and then the other later adopt the same child . 
  also not enough childs available for all the gay people anyway , so a very moot issue . 
   tax benefits . 
  they got them since ** 2001 ** . 
  ( by ruling dated 2013 , but still ), 
   i was under the impression that you were saying that in practice i could actually pay by bank transfers . 
  you can . 
  what 's the problem here ? 
  you were annoyed by companies ** in your own country ** not accepting bank transfers . 
  which they obviously do . 
   has the one clause of `` except if you actually want to pay online and do n't have a credit card . '', 
  ** to non-european companies ** . 
   because it takes effort and dealing with regulations to set up payment processors ? 
  i have no idea what you 're trying to say . 
   just look at the options you very for buying reddit gold . 
  i get `` credit card , paypal , bitcoin . '', 
  i ca n't see a bank transfer option . 
  because reddit is an american company ? 
  what 's tripping you up here ? 
   while civil partnered couples do n't . 
  but they do . 
  dude , she does n't have * anything * against gay people . 
  she just does n't want them to marry , * that 's it * !, 
   it 's morally wrong to deny this right to people . 
  but it 's not . 
  they got all the rights , they just were n't able to call themselves `` married '' . 
  makes absolutely no sense , why would n't they . 
   then i suggest you look at their campaigns and programs from 4 years ago . 
  that people who did n't care did n't know is not surprising . 
  they would n't have cared this time either . 
  but nobody cared . 
  except those that want to marry but were n't allowed to . 
  that 's the point , yes . 
  because we need something like that , you said so yourself . 
   can be moved to something else . 
  like a ... civil partnership ? 
   if what you would claim were true than friday 's law would be ruled unconstitutional . 
  i can predict the future : it will not be . 
  yeah , that could really go either way . 
  and i do believe we will get a ruling . 
   the court just found that it clearly referred to something between a man and a woman . 
  which is going to be a problem if this new change is not going to change the constitution . 
   and constitutional changes , of course . 
  like ... gay marriage ? 
  they do n't intend to change the grundgesetz ? 
  oh dear me , that 's going to be a shitshow for months then . 
   i seriously do n't get why people think that . 
  because the people will have forgotten about it by then . 
   for the last elections every major party except the cdu/csu were already pro marriage equality . 
  what ? 
  i never heard a single word about that . 
  nobody cared . 
   if they actually pull this off before the election , i 'm much more likely to vote schulz now than i was before , considering last election 's experiences . 
  and i 'm going to bet that the other people who care about the topic wo n't suddenly start voting cdu . 
  that does n't make sense . 
  it 's a win-win for merkel . 
  if it passes then the issue is out of the election campaigns and if it does n't pass she can say `` not my fault !, 
  but it 's double the karma !, 
  that 's no service that 's just ... accepting bank transfers . 
  anyone does that . 
  what services ? 
  accepting bank transfers ? 
  why would n't it ? 
  oh , yes , of course !, 
  their area did seem kinda small to me ... 
  so you 're saying you do n't agree with preventing market monopolies . 
   yeah , because you have other services available that can take their place , right ? 
  well , we do n't have them here . 
  sepa is available all over the eu . 
  that 's the point . 
  that 's revenue . 
  take googles money ? 
  what kind of a question is that ? 
  if you fine someone and they wo n't then you take their assets by force . 
  that 's how it works in switzerland and anywhere else . 
  no , you 're fine . 
  and in your comparison it 's also important to note that tesco is virtually the only store anyone ever goes to . 
   is n't it up to google what results they want to publish on their own website ? 
  of course not . 
  they 're a monopoly . 
  and garnish googles european revenue streams obviously , because there must be * some * . 
  i 'm seeing ads daily on youtube , so they * are * getting money from here . 
  what the hell ? 
  take googles money , by force . 
  what else ? 
  so you 're saying you do n't agree with preventing market monopolies . 
  that ca n't be right . . * checking * ...  [ alphabet reported a 29 percent jump in quarterly profit to $ 5.4 billion , while revenue jumped 22 percent compared with a year ago to $ 24.75 billion . 
  ] ( https://phys.org/news/2017-04-google-parent-alphabet-revs-revenue.html ) so they got fined for about half of one quarter of their yearly profit .
