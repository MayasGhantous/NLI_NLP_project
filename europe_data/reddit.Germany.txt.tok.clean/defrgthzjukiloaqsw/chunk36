  fair enough . 
  * footballfield : 120,000 * 90,000 mm = 10,800,000,000 mm \u00b2 . 
  * $ 1 coin : 23.25 mm * 23.25 mm = 46.5 mm \u00b2 . 
  * 10,800,000,000 / 46.5 = 232,258,064 million $ 1 coins per football field . 
  * $ 2.2 b / 232m ~ 9.5 footballfield of $ 1 coins lying next to each other . 
  [ it 's about three of these .

  awesome museum , one should totally go if one is in stockholm . 
  you 're not realizing that the carrier has planes going 1,000 knots ? 
  i do n't have to outrun the carrier that 's hundreds of miles away anyway and i ca n't outrun its planes . 
  that 's be my point , yeah . 
  you were asked to give reasons for having an aircraft carrier in the ** baltic ** . 
  that would require me to entertain the possibility of ww3 . 
  because an aircraft carrier can outrun missiles ? 
  war ? 
  a war where we level entire countries with superior airpower and then go home after two weeks ? 
  what are these wars you 're talking about ? 
   not uk soil . 
  and ? 
  what 's the point here ? 
   if you do n't understand the magnitude of that diplomatic and strategic hurdle , i ca n't help you . 
  the uk wo n't fight a war on it 's own against ... whom anyway ? 
  belarus ? 
  on its own without any allies like ... denmark , sweden , germany , poland ? 
  with a * single * carrier even ? 
   you do n't send oil tankers in war zones . 
  of course you do . 
  because you need oil in war zones . 
  because denmark suddenly vanished ? 
  sweden ? 
  germany ? 
  or because the baltic is only 200nm away from the uk ? 
  a carrier sure is nice in the mediterranean , but i fail to see a use for one in the baltic . 
  one ca n't outrun enemies . 
  it 's sure nice to have to get quicker to whereever one wants to be , but who really cares if that takes three instead of two weeks ? 
  what ? 
  it 's a ship . 
  it floats . 
  it if would n't float it 'd sink and not be a ship . 
   removal of all sorts of legal but nonstandard comments is undoubtedly to be expected no , no one is expecting anything like that . 
  best one i read today , i literally chuckled . 
  oh , you took the title literally ? 
  i 'm pretty sure op does have antihistamines that are helping op . 
   wow i did n't know it could be that bad !, 
  oh definitely . 
  as a kid i could n't go within hundreds of feets of fields or lawns without medication because without it i 'd immediately sneeze about ten times a minute , have a swollen nose and eyes itching like someone poured tabasco in them . 
  also asthma . 
  the asthma was really quite unpleasant , i 'd cough all night and barely get any sleep too . 
  thankfully i felt barely anything the last decade or so , but this year it 's gotten bad quite bad . 
  the other day i went for a walk because of the good weather and within an hour i sneezed like thirty times and got quite itchy eyes . 
  i would n't be able to do any work outside for example . 
  medication for that is grouped under [ antihistamines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antihistamine ) , mine is called [ desloratadine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desloratadine ) and the only one that helps me . 
  but if i take 5mg of it i 'm completely symptom-free for 24 hours without any side effects , so it 's not really a big deal anymore . 
  huh ? 
  of course it does , but this forecast is telling you to take it . 
   they ca n't go outside in all these areas ? 
  not without medication , no . 
   and i do n't understand how this can help people allergic to pollen ? 
  stay inside or take your medication . 
  essentially it saves half an hour of ( extreme ) unpleasantless until the meds kick in after taking if you did n't take it inside . 
  because what cardinals do in vatican city is n't work ? 
  the pope ? 
  his aides ? 
  wtf ? 
  that 's wrong . 
  it would defeat the whole point of a franchise . 
  the ts also has sauce accompanying the ts , which the cheese does not have . 
  and ( bigger ) onions . 
  yes , please . 
  - selling food without license ? 
  ( possibly illegal ) - selling * anything * without business permit ( probably illegal ) - buying stuff at px not for personal consumption , but for commercial profit ? 
  ( likely illegal ), 
  which is google shopping yes . 
  and there 's ** literally ** `` google shopping '' written above those `` few links '' . 
  google does n't sell you any products , try to keep up . 
  so theyl 'll be decimated , maybe they should 've thought about that before breaking the law . 
  what ? 
  in the case of facebook * everyone knows * that they were intentionally lying . 
  everybody knew it in 2014 already actually . 
   the one who signed the papers ? 
  yes . 
   often that person knows the least about it . 
  then he should 've made an effort . 
  tough luck . 
   so every time you ~ ~ put misleading information ~ ~ ** commit fraud ** ~ ~ into the official document ~ ~ you should go to jail as well ? 
  ftfy, 
  i 've read the limit is increased to 4 % in the near future . 
   it 's a punitive fine , meant to discourage companies from doing exactly what vw did . 
  it 's not meant to have any relation to the amount of environmental damage done , but rather to significantly outweigh any potential profit that a company could make . 
  additionally , vw was fined substantially less than the maximum . 
  you realize that you could substitute vw with fb and epa with commission in that statement and it would be correct , yes ? 
  percentage increases with significance of misconduct , where 's the problem ? 
  there 's literally `` google shopping '' written above those `` few links '' . 
   it probably has n't brought in 3 billion in revenue , worldwide , throughout its operating life . 
  that 's irrelevant . 
   to me , it seems to indicate that the ec system for determining fines is a bit arbitrary .
