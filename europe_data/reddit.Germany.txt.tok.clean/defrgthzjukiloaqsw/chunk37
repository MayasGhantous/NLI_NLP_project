  percentage of revenue ? 
  seems perfect to me . 
  and it 's glorious . 
  * so * much better than before . 
  whatever , as long as tschirner sings chansons to me i 'm happy . 
  we could get klaas to do it , i believe he has some kind of band or something like that . 
  get nora tschirner to do some chanson number . 
  ( i mean , one can dream , right ? ), 
  b\u00f6hmermann should do `` unser star for lisbon '' like raab did . 
   i said it had nothing to do with public transportation and it has everything to do with avoiding taxes and thus offering very low rates . 
  and that 's wrong . 
  american public transportation is * shit * , you have no other options than uber . 
   the way they do this is by selling an app that connects a driver ( independent contractor ) to a customer ( thus , my comparison to tinder ) . 
  99 % of american uber users do n't know that and therefore it 's irrelevant . 
   t would help if you followed the entire conversation instead of narrowing in on bits and fragments . 
  it would certainly help if * you * would follow the conversation , yeah . 
   a court of law would definitely care very much what they write in the contract you sign with them when you set up an account , especially when you 're suing uber on the basis of that contract . 
  no , it would n't . 
   that 's not generally a good rule of thumb . 
  you should try and read any and every contract you put your signature on , be it electronic or hardcopy . 
  it 's a very good rule . 
  in germany at least . 
   this might be the case in the eu . 
  here , in the us , those terms and conditions are pretty much unassailable . 
  you should look at the ** title of this thread ** again . 
  it 's about ubers status ** ineurope ** . 
  but uber is a taxi service everywhere else , too . 
  it 's just that american law does n't care about consumers . 
   it 's not difficult to find out how they define the services they 're selling you . 
  for fucks sake , dude . 
  this is not about what they * claim * they are . 
  everybody knows that . 
  this is about ** how they present themselves to the customer ** . 
   hat 's what you click on when you accept terms and conditions while setting up your account on the app , whether as customer or driver . 
  nobody reads those . 
  i know , that is what i said . 
  because that 's not how it works . 
  the customer does not get to choose the price . 
   yes , they are portraying themselves as that . 
  not to the customer , no . 
  download their app and tell me precisely where they portray themselves as you claim . 
   think of it like a tinder for drivers and customers . 
  dude , i know what they claim to be !, 
    why is it even possible to bend laws and regulations in a way that uber has so far not been considered a transportation service ? 
   and not as you understood dear god , english is n't your first language , is it ? 
    because in the us public transportation is nonexistent impractical , so uber is considered as a godsent gift ( it fills in the lack of a public good ) . 
  their model is not transferrable everywhere though . 
  is a correct answer to that question . 
  in the usa ? 
  not a gun , no . 
  but an eviction notice if you ca n't make rent . 
  they get evicted with like two weeks notice if they do n't pay on time . 
  you 've heard of minimum wage ? 
   do n't have preplanned trips or did n't get new customers via radio call ( yes , the legislation is quite old , an app is very likely covered by that ) . 
  i 'd allow that * if * they get the new customer on their way back to their base of operations . 
  they must not wait anywhere and yet they do ... 
  got to have * some * distinction between them and taxis . 
   as far as i understand the original idea was ride-sharing and crowd-based private transportation services , was n't it ? 
  no , never . 
  that was just what they told everyone , but it was ( and is ) a lie . 
  finally , at least one sensible comment . 
  heroin is good then ? 
  both buyer and dealer prefer buying and selling heroin to the alternative ( no heroin ) . 
   yeah and that is why uber is never short on drivers willing to work there 's literally tens of millions of ridiculously poor people in the usa . 
  they have no other choice but to do anything they can to make a buck . 
   customers willing to use the service . 
  taxis ** in the usa ** suck hard . 
  they are n't a real alternative in most cities . 
  why is that ? 
  because they are n't regulated * enough * . 
   in paris you 'd be hard pressed to find a taxi obeying these rules . 
  this just in : if most people do n't follow rules the rules are stupid !, 
   are you seriously questioning the validity of taxis ? 
  taxis are a part of public transportation . 
  just the other day an american actually tried to tell me that they 're not public transportation . 
  because the english language wiki site on public transportation does not include the word `` taxi '' . 
  they 're idiots , all of them . 
  please point me a source saying that london taxi driver no longer have `` to take the knowledge '' . 
  so who will provide taxi service at 4 am on a thursday in bumfuck , france in your utopia ? 
  * for the same price as any other time * . 
   even blablacar is apparently starting to have people run ferry services and basically be long-term transport . 
  true , but obviously illegal without a license . 
   but you do know in a lot of cities the taxi profits do n't go to the taxi driver ? 
  who cares ? 
   they go to the medallion owner who is granted a oligopoly by the local municipality . 
  for lots of good reasons * and * obligations . 
   ride sharing companies fucking stop calling them that , you 're not sharing anything , you 're summoning a driver for hire . 
  your friend lied to you or did n't understand how uber works . 
  not even nyc has good public transport , but it 's not your fault that you 've never seen how it 's supposed to be done . 
   uber portrays itself as a app that connects customers to contractors they actually ** do n't ** portray themselves as such * in the app used by the customer * . 
  i 've used the app . 
  when i open it i see a map and can enter a destination and press a `` i want to be driven there '' button . 
  then a driver picks me up and drives me there while uber charges my credit card . 
  i have ** no ** way of knowing or even assuming that the driver is n't an uber employee and i do n't care . 
  the service is provided * to me * by uber , not by the driver . 
   this has nothing to do with public transportation in the u.s. and it has everything to do with that . 
  the point was `` why do americans think well of uber '' and that 's the answer . 
  as if ariana did n't do the math , right ? 
  those people are n't desperate . 
   has there been a statement on whether the uk would be allowed to rejoin the eu if they so asked ?
