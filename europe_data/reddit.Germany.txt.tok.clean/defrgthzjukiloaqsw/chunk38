  if their laws are sufficiently eu-compatible ... sure , why not ? 
  but they 'd have to join the euro and schengen and there 'd be no more rebate . 
  ** i 'm saying that more intelligent ( which is different from smart ) people are usually more wealthy than less intelligent people . 
   except i just pointed out one example of the abuse of facts and so did you ? 
  shitty people do shitty things . 
  that ca n't mean we should n't find out all the facts we can . 
   when it comes to fission , we 'd have to ask if the development of nukes and the potential destruction they could cause is worse than what we get out of having nuclear energy . 
  that 's a tough one but pretty grey . 
  ask the people of hiroshima and nagasaki while you 're at it . 
   when it comes to potentially defining a segment of the population as less intelligent , i ca n't see anything particularly useful from that . 
  but i can see the potential for genocide . 
  they 're already defined as such , it 'd just be interesting to find out which gene ( s ) are responsible for that . 
  which means we could get more intelligent babies in the future . 
  that 's obviously a win . 
  what the hell ? 
  why kill stupid people ? 
  we need them . 
  the facts ca n't be abused . 
  shitty people do shitty things . 
  you 're basically saying no one should have discovered nuclear fission just because it can ( and was/is ) abused . 
   you 're trying to make a causal link between intelligence and wealth . 
  you realize that i have to question yours now , right ? 
  i told you twice what i 'm saying and both times you did n't understand it . 
  and ? 
  i 'm saying that more * intelligent * ( which is different from smart ) people are ** usually ** more wealthy than less intelligent people . 
  i do n't see how that 's controversial . 
  because those rich parents are also more intelligent , which is why they 're rich . 
   the genetic impact of that is far overstated . 
  in regards to wealth ? 
  sure , but intelligence is very genetic . 
  just as beauty or tallness or marathon-ability . 
  yeah , that does n't make sense . 
  you ca n't abuse `` this part of the population is genetically less intelligent '' . 
   right , because facts and science have never been abused before ? 
  what ? 
  does n't make them non-facts . 
  so what ? 
  more intelligent people tend to be more wealthy . 
  incorrect . 
  the religious head of the catholics just happens to be king . 
  they 're two different legal institutions . 
   point taken but i do n't remember a single democratically elected king . 
  if your notion of election includes `` twelve dudes that inherited the right to elect the king '' then yes . 
  ye said `` you can '' . 
  he did n't claim that it ever actually happened . 
  because a president would be sooooo much cheaper , right . 
  you 're so wrong i ca n't even start to teach you . 
   and the impact of genetics in humans tends to be greatly overshadowed by things like education and environment . 
   that 's what we tell ugly , dumb or poor people to comfort them . 
  why not ? 
  facts are facts . 
  for example : there 's a certain tribe in north africa that absolutely dominates marathons . 
  that 's a fact . 
  those people are genetically superior to anyone else in marathon running . 
  some people are genetically superior to others because they 're more intelligent . 
  some people are genetically superior to others because they 're taller . 
  facts . 
  i would also advocate for more wearing of crowns . 
  or tiaras at least . 
  i 'm disappointed that he 's not wearing his crown . 
   restaurants are n't necessary . 
  we already covered that * recreational * businesses are obviously necessary on sundays . 
   does n't match my experience . 
  currently cutting stupid hours is all the rage over there . 
  apparently nobody wants shoes on sunday 10pm . 
  you buy shoes in grocery stores ? 
  there 's your problem right there . 
  because ... * drumroll * they 're stupid ? 
  how did you not notice ? 
   yes , it 's silly to close restaurants on sundays and it does n't make sense to close pool on sundays . 
  as silly as closing grocery shops  except that grocery shops are n't necessary on sundays . 
   we 've already established not working on sunday is not a universal right . 
  german constitution disagrees . 
   i do n't see what is exceptional about grocery shops to make them close . 
  they 're closed because they 're ** not ** exceptional . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  the default is : ** noone may be employed ** . 
  and the restaurant is the exception . 
   it 's not like letting anybody work on sundays would make everybody work 24/7 . 
  or even on sundays . 
  offices and other non-walk-in jobs would n't suddenly work on sundays . 
  lots of them would , yeah . 
   if shop thinks it 's worth to pay their employees 2x because many people want to go shopping on sundays ... 
  they 're not paying twice . 
   businesses do n't want to stay open just for the sake of staying open to keep slaves busy  but they would . 
  one of them would open sunday and then everybody else would be scared and then everybody would open . 
   i know that 's an exception . 
  that 's why we 're talking about it . 
  i do n't see what 's so exceptional about them compared to grocery shop . 
  if they 're not exceptional they 'd have to close . 
  so you want restaurants and cinemas to be closed on sundays ? 
  because that 's the only possible alternative to the status quo . 
  it 's not even about shops , it 's forbidden to employ * anyone * for anything on sundays , except * obviously * important stuff that has to be done on sundays . 
  steel production , power plants , restaurants , lifeguards at the beach or the pool . 
  are you saying pools should be closed on sundays ? 
  how does that make sense ? 
   fresh food good , prepared food better . 
  which just looks silly from afar . 
  people want to go to restaurants on days they do n't have to work . 
  that means restaurants have to be open for both the enjoyment of the people having their day off and because lots of restaurants would n't be able to stay open if they 'd have to close on sundays ... nothing silly about it .
