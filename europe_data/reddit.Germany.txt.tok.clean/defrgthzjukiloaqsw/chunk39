  they 're an ** exception ** from the law . 
  allowing those businesses to open for quite obvious reasons . 
  they would , nobody said otherwise . 
    this is your problem . 
  no shop would sell more if it 'd open on sunday . 
  they 'd just have extra staff costs . 
   absolute bullshit . 
  no , just a fact . 
  people do n't suddenly have more money just because shops are open on sundays . 
    because that other group is n't essential for familyfunday . 
  obviously . 
   and going to mcdonalds is ?!, 
  yes ? 
  obviously ? 
  ** familyfunday !, 
  **  why does the government get to decide for people how they should/can spend their free time . 
  how very liberal ... dude , the only other option would be : ** nothing ** is allowed to open on sundays . 
  you should be thankful that restaurants get to be open . 
  one is recreational ? 
  how is that not obvious ? 
  ah , you 're one of those who do n't understand that about a third of all people ** can not ** acquire these skills you 're talking about . 
  maybe you should try ... writing your position down ? 
  in , like , words ? 
  instead of writing something you did n't mean ? 
  for fucks sake !, 
    recreational industry needs to be able to be open on sunday . 
   why would it ? 
  people do n't need it and the workers need their holiday . 
  ** you ** want to close cinemas on sundays . 
  if you understand that the recreational industry obviously opens on sundays then what 's your problem ? 
   i think you have trouble understanding the concept that you were asked to provide reasons for restrictions . 
  but ** you ** want to restrict the recreational industry , i do n't . 
  it 's exempt for quite obvious reasons . 
   perhaps it 's due to lower english proficiency or something , either way i do n't think i can help you in your confusion . 
  sure as hell is better than yours . 
  yes , of course ? 
  what 's the point ? 
   why buying stuff in a gas station should differ from buying food in a shop ? 
  because the gas station is open anyway ? 
  and technically they 're only allowed to sell `` stuff you need while travelling '' . 
   i mentioned the shops in them . 
  if you have this level of trouble reading and comprehending i hope you would n't respond to me . 
  you did n't . 
  you wrote `` and i assume you also mean the stores '' , which does n't make sense in regards to gas stations . 
  the gas station ** is ** the store . 
  there is only the person working in it that is necessary to sell gas . 
  [ but you do n't agree ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66wcm1/where_sunday_trade_is_banned_in_europe/dgn5g0k/ ) you want to close the recreational industry on sundays . 
  what ? 
  i ' arguing ** for ** `` people need to be able to do fun things on their day off '' . 
   therefore as people can live without going to cinema it should be banned . 
  except they ca n't . 
  even our basic welfare that 's supposed to only cover bare necessities includes a small amount for cinema/theater . 
   the same could be said about some shops , they get the most business on weekends - taking away sundays causes a big loss for them , which could force them to close . 
  this is your problem . 
  no shop would sell * more * if it 'd open on sunday . 
  they 'd just have extra staff costs . 
   again , why is one group protected while the other is n't ? 
  because that other group is n't essential for familyfunday . 
  * obviously * . 
   i need something on sunday and there is no reason to go to the shop on sunday ? 
  no , there is no reason . 
  you would have bought that on saturday . 
   i should have bought everything on saturday even before i planed the picnic ? 
  yes , of course . 
  or go and buy it in the gas station . 
   going to the restaurant and going to a shop is exactly the same thing , you do n't need to do both , but its sure makes the life easier if you can ... no , restaurant is ** for fun ** . 
  shopping is not fun . 
  people do n't need ... * recreation * ? 
  what the hell ? 
  what the hell ? 
   and no need to go to the restaurant any more than to go to a shop . 
  you 're not going to a restaurant to be fed . 
  you 're going there for * fun * with family and friends who have free time . 
  it 's no different from cinemas . 
   so why are restaurants allowed to stay open if shops have to be closed ? 
  how is is not obvious that the * recreational industry * needs to be able to be open on * sunday * . 
   why are gas stations ( and i assume you also mean the stores ) allowed to be open if not regular shops ? 
  people need gas ? 
   so , it 's forcing the lifestyle on people that they do their shopping on saturday , despite the fact that this could cause hardships for people who ca n't shop on saturday for whatever reason . 
  so why do n't those people shop on wednesday ? 
  people are doing groceries any day of the week , most are actually going grocery shopping * several * days every week . 
  this is n't the usa where you have to drive 30 miles to the next walmart . 
   or buy the stuff you did n't have the time for during the week ? 
  shops are open 8-22 every single day except sunday , but you did n't have time to do your shopping during the week ? 
   but why specifically that group ? 
  what ? 
  nobody is allowed to be employed on sundays , except very few groups deemed essential for familyfunsunday . 
  also : restaurants and cinemas and all other recreational businesses would go bankrupt if they could n't open sunday . 
  kinda obvious ... 
   shops not being open is n't protecting workers , it 's limiting them for no good reason . 
  what ? 
  the workers do n't * want * to work on sundays , they 're quite happy they 're not allowed to . 
  there is absolutely no reason to shop on sunday . 
  and you go to the restaurant * for recreation on your fucking day off * . 
  with friends or family . 
   why do you apply different logic on both things ? 
  why do i apply different logic to different things . 
  yeah , i guess , that 's weird . 
  * people need money . 
  * some people have no skills .
