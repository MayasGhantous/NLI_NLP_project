  * those people ** have ** to work retail , they have no choice . 
   being allowed to work on sunday does n't mean you do n't have `` free day '' . 
  it just means your free day is a different day . 
  and that 'd be the problem . 
   want to go to the doctor ? 
  too bad , she 's not available . 
  no doctor is forbidden from seeing patients on sundays . 
   want to do menial stuff like shopping -- sorry , no can do . 
  shop on saturday , you have no reason to shop on sunday . 
   if you really wanted to improve things for everyone , just make them legally entitled to pick whatever two free days a week that they please . 
  forcing everyone to adhere to some ancient religious bullshit week cycle only makes life less convenient for everyone . 
  religion is irrelevant . 
  the important thing is that * everyone * has the same day off . 
   do n't people that work later shift have the same problem ? 
  no , those people have * sunday off as everybody else * . 
  you 're not listening to anything , this is completely useless . 
  you can shop on saturday . 
   i was speaking of the actual meaning of the word ( using dictionary definitions ) . 
  they 're still public transport . 
   well lets look at this `` a taxi is a private means of transport . 
  that doesnt sound very public now does it . 
  what the hell ? 
  ownership of the taxi company is completely irrelevant . 
  most busses performing public transport are owned privately , as are most ( all ? ), 
  trans in the uk . 
   `` a system of vehicles such as buses and trains that operate at regular times on fixed routes and are used by the public '' . 
  - taxis do not operate on regular times and do not have fixed routes . 
  that 's a simple definition that forgot about taxis . 
   so stop acting like its the most obvious thing , i 'm literally using the definition of the word , not some legal definition in a specific country . 
  it really is amazingly obvious . 
   but i see you want to focus on this topic instead of not being able to answer a simple question . 
  what question ? 
  and what to you think taxis are if not public transport ? 
  it really is very obvious . 
   you obviously do n't know what necessity means ... 
  but lets use your `` logic '' for a moment , shopping can also be recreational , so it is a necessity that i be able to do it on sundays . 
  how is that any different to going to a restaurant ? 
  it 's not recreational . 
   and so on . 
  taxis dont fit these definitions , so , no - they are not public transport . 
  maybe restrain yourself from calling someone an idiot when you are not sure of your claim . 
  they ** are ** public transport . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96ffentlicher_personennahverkehr it 's hardly surprising that you do n't know that , although it 's really obvious . 
  why else would we have taxis ? 
  because that 's the deal we made with them : we gaven them a monopoly in exchange for them having to transport anyone who wants transport . 
  we even ** require ** them to be available any time of the day any day if someone wants to be transported . 
  how do you not understand that taxis are public transport ? 
  what else could they possible be ? 
  obviously they do , because people want to go to restaurants . 
  what 's wrong with you ? 
  no , you 're literally nuts . 
  that :  if you have stay at home wife to do it for you , sure . 
  but those of use who have to work during the normal opening hours and do n't have family to enslave just have to use their time more efficiently . 
  is too stupid to warrant any other response . 
   did you drop the / s ? 
  because you ca n't seriously think taxi drivers perform a public duty by working , lol . 
  yeah , i do n't know reality , right ? 
  what else do you think they 're doing if not public transport ? 
  that 's the whole point of having taxi licenses !, 
   and restaurant workers are in the exact same ` convenience category ' as shop employees . 
  for fucks sake , no , they 're not . 
  restaurants are for fun , for recreation . 
   unlike shop assistants and sales people ... 
  unlike what ? 
  shopping is n't recreational . 
   why do n't their families deserve that same one day off ? 
  they do ?!, 
  who said they do n't ?!, 
  but ** obviously ** necessary things have to be exempted . 
  the bus drivers have to work , too !, 
   and ? 
  how is that a necessity ? 
  what terrible thing will happen if restaurants are not open every day ? 
  people will starve ? 
  ... similarly if they cant buy food ? 
  how is it a necessity to be able to do recreational things ** on your recreational day off ?!, 
  ** you ca n't be serious !, 
   if restaurants are not open every day ? 
  most restaurants close at least one day a week , many two . 
    public transport !, 
   taxis arent public transport ... 
  they are not a necessity either . 
  oh , i 'm sorry , i was under the impression that you 're not an idiot . 
  of course they 're public transport . 
  that 's the whole point of taxi licenses . 
   if you have to ask `` what is wrong with all of you '' , maybe consider you are the one not making any sense . 
  all of you idiots not understanding why nobody should work on sundays . 
  no , that 's him . 
  no , it does n't . 
  you fail to understand that the law is n't `` stores must be closed ! '' . 
  the law is : `` nobody may be employed on sundays , * except * ... '' . 
   an example of what a local shop might look like . 
  i see . 
  we do n't have something like that in germany . 
   local stores have good produced locally , as opposed to supermarkets which usually have them produced further away . 
  it also refers to single branches , which are not corporately owned . 
  apparently we have no need for them either . 
  of course they do , for fucks sake , what 's wrong with all of you ? 
   restaurant staff ** recreational !, 
  **  taxi drivers ** public transport !,
