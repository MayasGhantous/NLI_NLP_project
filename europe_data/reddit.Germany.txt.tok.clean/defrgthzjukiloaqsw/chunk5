  the difficulty is that some scholars have argued that it is hard to tell if an animal is alive and healthy of it is stunned , but equally i have read muslims arguing that animals that are conscious are haram , not halal , because of muhammed 's injunction to be merciful to animals . 
  apparently this is a controverse topic in islam . 
  pretty sure the jews want their meat slaughtered awake , though . 
   but i really ca n't see the fuss about some words . 
  nobody cares about the words . 
  the ecj also decided against mass surveillance , several times already . 
  and it will do so again . 
   the cjeu draws on echr law , but wo n't let the echr anywhere near eu law obviously . 
  the echr is n't part of the eu . 
  eh ... technically true . 
  but you can leave the eu without leaving the echr . 
  nah , you 're doing that wrong . 
  the politicians will go screaming `` the echr ( which is not part of the eu by the way ) is trying to forbid investigating child pornographists !, 
   my understanding is that for the commercial operations that supply halal animal meat to the general population the animals are stunned just like in an standard slaughter procedure , then it 's not halal . 
  not a broken , but when you told her you would use one and then do n't . 
  no , if a housewife feels raped 321 times by her husband , because she did n't feel like it at the time , and reports it as such then sweden will count that as 321 cases of rape . 
  that does n't sound like much , though . 
  the fact that the animals are conscious when slaughtered might annoy some people . 
  then they do n't eat at all . 
   it saves time and money when they do n't have to make two separate dishes . 
  they never have to make two separate dishes . 
  the muslims just do n't eat the prk when it 's on the menu . 
  case closed . 
  actually muslim parents should be fined severely for religious indoctrination aka as child abuse and this no-pork-for-you nonsense . 
  but sadly that 's not pc . 
  so the immigrant children get to have food provided for them by the kindergarten , but the actual danes have to bring their own ? 
  you do n't see anything wrong with that ? 
  the point is that the immigrants have to * integrate into danish culture * . 
  yes , that means either eating pork or keeping their mouth shut when others around them eat pork . 
  if they can not do that they will have to leave . 
  it 's really that simple . 
   leverpostej i need to go shopping ... 
  exactly , on days pork is served the muslims can just eat the vegetarian option . 
  that wo n't be a problem because no normal european woman would date poor illiterate immigrants . 
  yeah , that 's not funny . 
  a couple million spent on torpedos to sink refugee boats is so much cheaper . 
  of course it would . 
  greece ( and the eu ) could stop anyone from coming in . 
  [ kind of like this possibly ] ( http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/23841/21768858_4.jpg?v=8d2370a1492d8f0 ) ? 
   17 friends see , there is a fundamental misunderstanding . 
  one , not even americans , does not actually have 17 friends . 
   it would depend on who you spoke to . 
  i 'm just watching i kveld med ylvis on youtube . 
  i would n't be able to follow most of it without the subtitles , but it seems easier to me than danish . 
   and norwegian ( which i can read but not understand when spoken ) really ? 
  i 'm at aboutish danish a2 and norwegian seems pretty much as understandable as danish to me . 
  maybe even more because they do n't have a hot potato in their mouth and enunicate much clearer . 
  how do the numbers relate to the cerf ? 
  isenkramshops sell explosives nowadays ? 
  then do n't take the tests offered during ramadan . 
  nobody , besides you , cares . 
  i know they do , that 's the point . 
  if they can work they can take tests during ramadan . 
  so maybe they should eat something . 
  will a muslim builder tell his boss he can not work for a month because his religion requires him to not eat ? 
   that sounds like a good talking point , but it really is n't . 
  this is an odd anachronism that is more funny than meaningful . 
  that 's merely a service provided for a fee . 
  quite profitable for the state . 
   because you can not be a christian in germany if you do n't pay that tax . 
  at least one guy has been excommunicated ( beliefs do n't count , only the wallet does ? ), 
  and many people are leaving the church because they want to avoid the tax . 
  that the churches decision . 
  it does not want you as a member of their special club if you do n't pay your church tax . 
  who the hell are we to tell the church otherwise ? 
   i would n't consider germany a secular state since the state collects religion taxes . 
  that 's merely a service provided for a fee . 
  quite profitable for the state . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  greece is safe . 
  if he leaves he 's not fleeing from war . 
  there is literally no job available to those economic migrants in germany . 
  i know a shelter in germany where the `` refugees '' still share double bedrooms in former military barracks because there 's literally no other apartments available to put them in . 
  weird . 
  if they were n't offered a choice they 'd be put on the plane * by force * . 
  definitely better than where they came from . 
  rather irrelevant in his example . 
  once they 've reached australia they 're ** definitely ** no longer refugees after leaving * at least * one safe country . 
  if they 'd said this months ago they 'd have done something about it . 
  i 'm not sorry that your precious uk wo n't get what it wants . 
  the uk will ** not ** get a deal in which it stays part of the single market but does not accept free movement , why are you people unable to understand that ? 
  ** if ** the uk would accept that it would be joining efta , but it does not want that so it wo n't be joining efta so pointing at efta is ridiculously redundant . 
   one guy said it was not possible to be out of the eu and in the single market that 's obviously true , but ** irrelevant ** . 
  well , technically , sure . 
  will the eu a departing uk to become part of efta or eea or even offer the uk a similar package like they offered switzerland ? 
  i doubt it . 
  and the uk wo n't accept it anyway , because they 'd have to keep paying their dues . 
  and this time without special rebate . 
  that may be , i did not say anything to the contrary . 
  does n't make that accent over the top . 
  the uk does not want the same solution as norway , so why bother talking about it . 
  it must be , the eu has said `` no single market without all of the other virtues of eu '' and the uk keeps failing to understand that . 
  i know klaus kinski of course , but werner herzog ? 
  never heard of him . 
  apparently werner herzog is mostly famours outside of germany . 
   only roughly 99,9 % of the people i met . 
  it 's called confirmation bias . 
   i 'll correct myself now : there 's a thing you 're saying that is ridiculously wrong : you 're suggesting that an accent is less thick the more people speak like it . 
  that 's not only wrong , it 's plain moronic . 
  whether 1 person or 82 million speak like that is entirely irrelevant to the original statement , it 's a thick and deliberately exaggerated accent regardless .
