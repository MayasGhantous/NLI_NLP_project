  it 's not very thick and certainly not exaggerated . 
   yes , some germans talk like that . 
  most . 
   however , he does not talk like that . 
  and ? 
   how thick/over-the-top it was ? 
  zero . 
   i honestly could n't imagine a thicker german accent than that and it probably was the thickest he could do . 
  you 've not met many germans then . 
  smoooth . 
  the accent really honestly is not * that * thick . 
  millions of germans speak like that . 
  it 's a perfectly normal german accent . 
  antiques roadshow !, 
  and it 's hard to teach ten years old kids the ipa and nearly a dozen vowels and consonants that either do n't exist in german or are just different in english because it 's incredibly boring and every year it gets harder to retrain and by age 16 there 's really no point in doing so if most of the students go on and become painters anyway . 
  you put in fake german accents for germans on american tv shows , so why should n't you put fake american accents on americans in american tv shows ? 
  honestly , is werner herzog actually famous ? 
  i 've never heard about him until today . 
  [ 1 ] wtf ? 
  the only movie by him i 've ever seen was `` queen of the desert '' and that was ... interesting . 
  never even heard about most of the others . 
  interesting . 
  my understanding is if you 're using the same grammar but just sound differently it 's an accent , is n't it ? 
   well , it is over the top , no . 
   and intentionally exaggerated . 
  jain . 
  he 's using a normal german accent intentionally . 
   i think it is nice . 
  it is the stereotypical german accent , like it is used by americans to draw germans pretty often . 
  when ze americans speak about ze germans it 's just that little bit more exaggerated . 
   most germans on r/de btw . 
  also complained about it . 
  as i said in another place . 
  most reddit-germans do n't actually know what normal germans sound like when speaking english . 
  lots of them also believe that most germans speak fluent english . 
  they do not . 
   it is pretty rare , that somebody is pretty fluent in english and has at the same time such a strong accent . 
  in this combination it is over-the-top . 
  oh dear god , will you people please stop . 
  it is not over the top or \u00fcbertrieben , that is a perfectly normal german accent . 
  it 's not even particulary heavy . 
  you do it to people speaking german in tv shows , so ... maybe ? 
   how is that not what `` over the top '' means ?????????????????????????????????????????????????? 
  because it does not compare to ** his ** normal accent . 
  [ i mean german does not have / w / and therefore germans use / v / when speaking english , even though english does have / w / * and * / v / . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_german_phonology )  but you pronounce the beginning of vater and wasser differently , or am i misunderstanding something ? 
  that 's / f / and / v / . 
  and i literally quoted * and * told you that `` over the top '' does * not * compare to * his * normal english . 
  so therefore i 'm trying to help you understand the words you seem to have trouble with ? 
   take a chill pill . 
  i 'm perfectly chill and trying to help you ?? 
   okay so you think he did n't speak like that on purpose , i think he did . 
  oh come on now , are you serious ? 
  where do you think i wrote that ? 
  because i did not . 
  i 'm willing to help you , but i honestly do n't know where you got that from . 
  i mean , i even quoted you the definition of `` over the top '' ? 
  everytime , yeah . 
  but that happens just as often as meeting europeans who speak english well . 
   it 's relevant because you said `` it 's not over the top '' . 
  it 's not . 
   it 's actually over the top when you know how his normal english sounds . 
  that 's not what `` over-the-top '' means . 
  it does not compare to * his * normal english , but to the general populations normal english . 
   over the top : [ too extreme and not suitable , or demanding too much attention or effort , especially in an uncontrolled way  ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/over-the-top ) i 'd trust the translator ( me ) in this thread , please . 
   his pronunciation is a homage to werner herzog . 
  why are you certain of that ? 
  there 's literally millions of people that sound exactly like that . 
  it 's actually not relevant to this discussion if his natural accent is better or worse , my point is that the one in ops video is * not * over-the-top . 
  reddit-germans sometimes need a reality check when they believe that germans usually speak perfectly fluent received pronunciation . 
  and most of the time those sames reddit-germans do n't even speak perfectly themselves . 
  and it 's easier to sing in a perfect accent than speak in it by the way , lots of germans do it . 
  somehow i also remember that i made this comment regarding the accent he had in the 45minute show-on-english while speaking , i 'm confused now . 
  but the point applies in both cases , the accent in the music video really is n't over-the-top in any way , the one while talking in the show is ~ ~ worse ~ ~ more german . 
  exactly , indians really * do * speak like that . 
  or japanese , koreans , australians , californians , indiana-ans ( indianiaians ? 
  the state , not the country ) and so on . 
  once you figure that out you stop caring about your own accent so much . 
  and german ( the language ) actually does not have a two different sounds for `` v '' and `` w '' like english has for example , so it 's hardly surprising that germans tend to have a hard time going undetected . 
  realistic german who knows how germans sound when speaking english . 
  why ? 
  certainly possible that his natural accent is ~ ~ better ~ ~ less german , but it 's a perfectly normal german accent . 
  true , but if you 're trying to describe that particular turkish german rapping dialect to americans it 's probably easiest to say `` it 's like ebonics '' or `` urban german '' . 
  also known as urban german . 
  huh ? 
  that accent is not over the top , it 's just a normal german accent . 
  i 've read something about that recently and there appears to be some disagreement between germany and austria and because of that this may happen . 
  quite sensible it would seem . 
  they still print them in germany , although i 've never took one home since 15 years or so . 
  once every two years there 's pallets of phonebook standing around in the local best buy equivalent for everyone to take however many one wants . 
  trolls are flying low again . 
  go read a book . 
   ah right , because germany does not take the gamer and censors it themselves , it does not fit your definition . 
  it does not fit ** the ** definition . 
   they only ban the game from a market of over 80 million people . 
  much better . 
  sure , if it qualifies for a ban , yes . 
   are you retarded , because otherwise you might understand what `` censorship '' is and how it is happily handed out in germany . 
  and you still do n't understand . 
   how should anyone guess ?
