  perhaps because they openly stated it on their website , that they have no dealings with gema . 
  what the hell ? 
  you think i 'm going to google `` monstercat '' ? 
  why ? 
  nobody cares about them . 
  because some journalist do n't know the meaing of the word you ... good god . 
  read the fucking article ffor fucks sake . 
  gema did not do what you claim it did . 
  and how should anyone guess that monstercat is n't a member of gema ? 
  because if they 're not your post makes even less sense . 
  ** youtube ** blocked their videos . 
  complain to ** youtube ** . 
  it 's called `` a phonebook '' . 
  probably less than 1 % of finns . 
  so ... i dunno , maybe 30k people ? 
   asking your closest friends about their salary is already considered a touchy subject . 
  is it ? 
  why ? 
  yes , obviously . 
  because youtube did not buy the license it had to . 
  what the ? 
  if `` monstercat '' whoever the fuck that is is not a member of gema or any other similar club in the world then why the fuck are we talking about them ? 
  they would 've but youtube did it itself for good reasons . 
  of course you do , because you signed over * all * rights to gema . 
   no , they do n't . 
  this is clear and undisputable . 
  wtf ? 
  you must live in a very different reality from everyones else ' . 
  did monstercat buy a broadcast license from gema or not ? 
   i am familiar with what usk is . 
  apparently you 're not . 
  you claimed germany would censor games , but it does n't . 
   i do n't claim to be all knowing , but i know for a fact that censoring/modifying games for germany happens . 
  case to the point : wolfenstein 3d . 
  this is an easy example , because it is widely known that germany it 's still butthurt of wwii and goes out of its way to prevent/hide/chastise anything remotely nazi . 
  you are one of * those * people that want to `` play '' `` kz manager '' ? 
  please show yourself out . 
   i ca n't tell you how frustrating it is to have some greedy , middle-man , self-righteous organization block half the videos so ... youtube ? 
  why do you hate youtube ? 
   performers ' right to equitable remuneration when their works are broadcast or communicated to the public . 
  which is exactly what youtube does . 
  because youtube refused to pay for the rights . 
  yeah fuck those artists demanding payment for services !, 
   if their members are not happy with the deal , then do n't upload it . 
  wtf ? 
  they never did . 
  stop being ridiculous . 
  of course it makes sense . 
  it has to be signed and therefore the book * must * exist . 
  why not ? 
   just out of curiosity , are public entities ( e.g. 
  the city of frankfurt ) strictly forbidden to enter this market in germany ? 
  no , there are several cities that provide internet access through the municipal infrastructure company that also provides water , electricity and/or heating . 
   they ca n't decide to form a company and start using it to lay fiber all around the city , then sell access to this fiber network to all the isps ? 
  they * could * . 
  they 're also very broke . 
  all of them . 
   i do n't think it should be a stumbling block ( comparatively speaking ) because so far it 's mostly just the reykjavik area that has fiber . 
  it 's a town of 210 thousand people . 
  in urban areas , greater population density makes things easier in this regard . 
  if this was financially viable in reykjavik , then why is it prohibitively expensive for german towns of a similar or greater population density ? 
  apparently you found a way to come up with the money ? 
  it 's not profitable to lay fibre so no company will do it with its own money . 
   the city of reykjavik , along with a couple of other municipalities , owns the company laying the cables . 
  see . 
  that 's how it should be , but sadly that 's not going to happen in germany . 
   i 'd be surprised if that 's the major stumbling block . 
  huh ? 
  what else ? 
  it 's prohibitively expensive to lay fibre into every home . 
  not gon na happen . 
   has there been a concerted effort like that in germany ? 
  to bring fiber to every home in the country 's largest urban areas ? 
  who 's gon na pay for that ? 
  and i do n't know how it is in iceland , but overground telecom cables will not happen in germany in any kind of town , even in the smallest . 
   as to why that is , you 'd have to tell me . 
  money . 
  and unlike in the uk the last mile is n't owned by a company that only owns the last mile , that 'd certainly help . 
  unfortunately we privatized . 
  just last year though our largest provider went with fttc in nearly all big city centres . 
  something around 20 or 30 million people can now get 100/40 using vdsl with vectoring . 
  and most of them do n't even order that , but only 16/1 because it 's like $ 15 cheaper . 
  so : a ) shit 's expensive , yo . 
  b ) people are n't ordering it even if they can . 
  to be fair it seems easier to connect ~ 350,000 people even in sparsely populated iceland than 80 million . 
  dsl and cable bandwith is limited to x mbit . 
  if x = 200 you can have 180/20 , 100/100 , 50/150 or any other combination adding up to 200 , pick one . 
  usually customers prefer higher downloads than uploads for what i think are obvious reasons . 
  if you are using an optical fibre directly to your customers you can just use two different frequencies for down/up and that 's symmetrical of course , but that 's not possible on dsl . 
  it is technically possible on cable connection of course , but there is nowhere in the world where people have their own cable connection , it 's always shared between at least a hundred households in a tree-shape . 
  so again , you have a maximum of 10,000 mbit and 100 customers , but you 're also greedy and know that not everyone uses their line at the same time ( probably ) an therefore you sell 400/20 to 100 customers instead of 50/50 to 100 customers . 
  if one of them uses 400 down it will work , most of the time , just not between 7 and 10pm when everyone wants to use it at the same time . 
  and then there is the problem that most isps do n't want their customers to uploads lots of things to `` the internet '' because they then would have to pay more for their connections to `` the internet '' . 
  tl ; dr : symmetry wastes bandwith that is better used for downloads because most people do n't have fibre connections . 
   as a teenager you 're supposed to work here anyway . 
  once you start doing that , your parents will start charging you money if you live with them , since you cost them money . 
  wtf was wrong with your parents ? 
    40mbit upload in a private home to do video conferences ? 
  are we grasping for straws here ? 
   uhm no ?
