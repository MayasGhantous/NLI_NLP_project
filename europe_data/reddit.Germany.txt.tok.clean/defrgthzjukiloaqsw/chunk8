  uhm , yes , that is the scenario we are talking about . 
   i 'm criticising that the connections are n't more synchronous . 
  i could even live with the ~ 2:1 ratio of 100/40 , but traditional dsl ( 16/1 ) as well as vdsl2 ( 50/10 ) and especially cable ( 120/6 ... 400/20 ) are simply ridiculous in this regard . 
  16:1 is not much , but mostly sufficient . 
  5:1 is fine , though , no idea what 's the problem there . 
  cable providers suck , yes . 
   but let 's go back to the hq video telephony/conferences : the codecs are becoming better , but after the current 1080p hype 4k will be the next step and even with codecs like h265 having 3-4 parallel calls in a family of 4-5 people is n't asking much . 
  you do n't need more than maybe 1 or 2 mbps for each phone videocalling . 
   the need for bandwidth gets completely ridiculous if you consider places like kindergardens , schools , cafeterias , coffee shops and so on . 
  see , i knew you were going to say this . 
  what you do n't realize is that * anyone * can get * any * bandwith * anywhere * for a price and there is no reason that * businesses * are entitled to 1000/1000 connections for $ 50 . 
    sure would be nice to have more , but incremental backups kinda work on the principle that one does n't have to think about them and so they can take hours without problem . 
   yeah but during that time they are prohibiting the other uses i listed , which is not very desirable . 
  no , they 're not . 
  they 're slowing down the other uses . 
    file sharing , illegal . 
   uh no ? 
  i never wrote about sharing copyrighted files . 
  there is no ( significant ) filesharing of non-copyrighted files . 
   even if i had , you did . 
   german law allows you to create up to 7 copies of anything you legally obtained and to give them to your friends and family . 
  technically you are n't even allowed to break the encryption of your blurays . 
  yes , in germany . 
     synchronizing music/video collections ,   probably illegal . 
   not it 's getting ridiculous . 
  there are more than enough ways to legally buy high quality music and video content . 
  obviously , but no need ** to upload ** it anywhere . 
   and even the drm-encumbered shit usually allows you to use it on 3-5 different machines . 
  that 's why you ** down ** load it to these 3-5 machines . 
     backing up pictures and videos from phones   yes , 14gb an hour is surely too slow for that . 
   you are again pretending/implying that there is only one such device using the network at any given time . 
  yes , i am very confident that uploading ** 14gb ** of pictures is at most a once in a month occurrence . 
   i 'm pretty sure that 40 mbit/s are n't very much for the coming years , even if that was n't the point i wanted to make . 
  and we will get faster connections then . 
  the point is that it 's much too much work to put fibre in every home * now * when vectoring provides 100/40 just fine and with a little more work in five years provides 200/80 . 
  most people do n't even buy the 100/40 * because they do n't need it * . 
   some companies like unitymedia had widespread problems with overbooking local nodes , yes . 
  but that was 2-4 years ago and has mostly been remediated . 
  i am rather well connected in the german it sector and the problems have really died down in nearly all regions . 
  that 's good to hear . 
   hq video telephony/conferences , 40mbit upload in a private home to do video conferences ? 
  are we grasping for straws here ? 
   decentralized backups of desktops and laptops , sure would be nice to have more , but incremental backups kinda work on the principle that one does n't have to think about them and so they can take hours without problem . 
   file sharing , illegal . 
   synchronizing music/video collections , probably illegal . 
   backing up pictures and videos from phones yes , 14gb an hour is surely too slow for that . 
  conclusion : there is no real need , it 's nice to have for sure , but no need . 
  and most non-redditors would n't even know half the things we are talking about here . 
   they offer the fastest access you can get atm , traditional telecommunication companies only offer up to 100 mbit/s with vdsl2 + vectoring . 
  sure , at 4am . 
  at 8pm you 're lucky if you actually get 20mbps . 
  awesome ! . 
   uhm it 's kinda okay in regard to the 100 mbit/s downstream , but nowhere near symmetry as it would be possible with fibre . 
  and why would you , specifically , need symmetry ? `  so none of your statements make any sense from a technological perspective . 
  haha , good one . 
   if you are lucky download speed is usable between 50-400mbit / s that 's the shitty cable providers . 
  they suck . 
   but the highest possible upload speed is 40 mbit/s with 100/40 vectoring and ? 
  since when is 40up not freakin ' awesome ? 
   have you been outside germany ? 
  optic fibre is the standard in most places in northern europe . 
  optic fibre does n't make sense in most cases . 
  i get 100/40 over a nice reliable pots copper cable just fine . 
  he has the cheapest plan . 
  they just sell `` 24mbit or whatever your line allows that 's not more then 24mbit '' for price x. 
  i too am [ unhappy about only getting this instead of the 100/40 i 'm paying for ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wgjr0qp.jpg ) . 
  fun fact : you are actually paying for those 2mbit . 
  the government is always independet from parliament . 
  it does n't actually matter . 
  i 'm not sure if i can find your definition in the oxford dictionary . 
   [ the group of people with the authority to govern a country or state ; a particular ministry in office . 
  ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government ) to me that definition is different from yours . 
  it is . 
  and spain does currently have a head and a cabinet . 
  there is no reason to assume that spains current government would n't present a budget . 
  there is no government lacking . 
  why do you believe the politicians are currently unpaid ? 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  for gods sake , you did n't even read the article . 
   two inconclusive elections on dec. 20 and june 26 have left the conservative popular party ** running a caretaker government for the past nine months ** _ saturday will be its 300th day . 
  because that is what happens . 
  so spain most definitely has a government . 
  i have to admit that i did n't get shot by anyone while i was in new york , so maybe their protection is working . 
  and then their courts decide that their cops do n't actually have a duty to serve or to protect . 
  and they still keep that slogan on their cars . 
  true story . 
  ( seriously . ), 
  i once said to an american police officer in new york that i 'm worried when there 's dozens of policemen standing around , because there must be a reason for that . 
  he did n't understand me and kept repeating that they 're there to protect me , i should feel safe . 
  different culture i guess . 
  [ fun fact : the dutch built all the euro note bridges ] ( https://www.visualnews.com/2014/12/17/bridges-euro-banknotes-fictional-dutch-designer-built-anyway/ ) . 
  the indifference is strong with this one . 
  it 's called `` million men march '' and similar things . 
  trump would be much better , if only because americans might wake up and get their voting laws in order . 
   the rebate was to correct the imbalance caused by the common agricultural policy . 
  the imbalance is the point of that policy . 
  it is ** designed ** to give more money to countries that have a larger agricultural sector . 
   what happened to the spirit of europe ? 
  you ... left ? 
   you must be the only german with a british car .
