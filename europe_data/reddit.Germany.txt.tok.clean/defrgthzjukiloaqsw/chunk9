  funnily enough i believe most germans still believe that opels are german cars . 
   when the goal of a united germany that originated in the middle of the 19th century , was fulfilled again . 
  wtf who writes shit like that , that 's not even remotely true . 
  first there 's so much missing that was german in 1871 and second october 3rd has nothing to do with that . 
  well , in the case of schleswig there was an actual referendum , though . 
  by the way , i do n't get how americans do n't love him . 
  do n't you guys love baywatch ? 
  joey and chandler do , is n't that typical for american men who are now in their mid to late 30s ? 
  i doubt most people who like him know or would care if they knew about his heritage . 
  it 's not the usa . 
  huh ? 
  he sold millions of albums in germany , he was an actual pop star in the early 90s . 
  that 's honestly not a bad song . 
  you must be a certified idiot . 
  ** every country in the whole fucking world has that kind of `` access '' you seem to think is `` access '' ** . 
  you do n't think that these people would mean something else that ** not every country int he world has ** ? 
  it 's absolutely ridiculous to assume they would say something that is already a given for ** every fucking country in the whole world ** . 
  learn how to speak english , you 're being ridiculous . 
  holy shit , you can not be so deluded . 
  i * am * correct and you 're not . 
  you should take this opportunity and learn something . 
  ** every country in the whole fucking world has that kind of `` access '' ** . 
  that is not what people are talking about when they are talking about access to the single market . 
    every single country in the whole fucking world currently has access to the single market in the way you , and only you , understand that phrase . 
  there is not a single one that is forbidden from doing any kind of business with the eu . 
   then we entirely agree that you were wrong . 
  fabulous . 
  you seriously need to learn to read . 
  i was and am correct this whole time . 
    south korea does n't have fucking access to the single market for fucks sake . 
   you literally do n't know what access means then . 
  having access to a market means being able to buy goods from it and sell goods to it . 
  again , it 's literally * you * that does n't know what that means . 
   south korea has access to the single market - it can purchase and sell goods to the members of the single market and it does not accept freedom of movement from the eu . 
  ** every country in the whole fucking world has that kind of `` access '' ** . 
  that is not what people are talking about when they are talking about access to the single market . 
   no it does n't . 
  access literally means access and nothing more . 
  if i wanted to say ` trade wo n't change by leaving ' i would have said that . 
  every single country in the whole fucking world currently has ** access ** to the single market in the way you , and only you , understand that phrase . 
  there is not a single one that is * forbidden * from doing any kind of business with the eu . 
    but that does n't mean that they have `` access '' to the single market in any way . 
   yes it does . 
  by definition . 
  do you not know what access means ? 
  fact of the matter is you do n't have any idea what you 're talking about . 
   yes i did . 
  so you literally do n't even read what i put , it 's all starting to add up . 
  see for example : south korea does n't have fucking access to the single market for fucks sake . 
  `` having access to the single market '' does not mean `` having a trade agreement with the eu '' . 
  that 's two different things . 
  and having the kind of trade agreement south korea has with the eu wo n't be enough for the uk , although that 'd probably be a good outcome of the negotiations for the uk . 
  there will most definitely not be a general free trade agreement for all kind of things between the eu and the uk . 
  anyone who 'd even entertain the hope is an idiot . 
   access to and membership of are clearly distinct . 
  nowhere did i ever claim the trade would be ` the same ' as it was whilst we were members . 
  that is what you do by saying `` the uk will have access to the single market '' . 
  because that is what that means . 
   i simply stated that yes , we would absolutely still have access to some degree , as a vast variety of nations do . 
  that is a completely irrelevant statement . 
  ** any ** nation in the world can sell and buy anything to/from the eu . 
  it does n't need to be mentioned . 
  some have it easier than other , but that does n't mean that they have `` access '' to the single market in any way . 
   many nations have access to the market - which you claimed is n't possible without accepting freedom of movement - yet they do n't accept freedom of movement . 
  so you 're just bluntly wrong . 
  you did n't even name a single nation that has what you claim exists . 
  because there is no such nation . 
  what the fucking hell is your problem ? 
  normal people understand `` access to the single market '' as  the uk will be able to trade with the eu ** just the same as it does today ** . 
  i explained to you that such an access is absolutely out of the question without the other freedoms . 
  for any country anywhere in the world that is absolutely impossible . 
  and no there is not a single country anywhere in the world that got such a deal . 
  you keep claiming that it is . 
  or you do n't understand what you are talking about at all . 
   you replied by saying ` only one which is not a member of the eea . ', 
   that was both wrong and a lie . 
  that 's both correct . 
   that was both wrong and a lie . 
  you claimed they could not have access in response to me stating that ` many nations have access to the single market without membership of it . ', 
  seriously , dude , ** what are you on about ** ? 
  nobody ** ever ** said you could n't sell us shit just the same you can sell shit to ghana . 
  ** that bears absolutely no relation to `` the single market '' whatsoever ** . 
  wtf are you on about ? 
  nobody ever said that any country in the world could possibly not have ** access ** in the sense that it may sell to and buy goods from the eu . 
   that is n't a fact at all . 
  there are many nations with access to the single market without membership of it only one which is not a member of the eea , which does require all the freedoms . 
   only membership requires accepting the ` freedoms . ', 
  that 's not true and you * should * know it . 
  huh ? 
  there will be absolutely no access to the single market of any kind without freedom of movement . 
  fact . 
  that $ 15b is obviously their own debt , but there 's no reason to assume any of the uk debt is their debt . 
  the map is incorrect . 
  in germany you 'll not lose your license going this much faster , it will only be suspended for a month . 
  does n't make sense , it 's not their debt . 
  the little properties they get they could just buy . 
  the uk would give scotland assets as a severance package ? 
   you , a german , are telling me , an englishman , that my country is only a country to `` appease the locals '' ? 
  i 'm telling you it 's not a country . 
  you just call it a country to appease the locals .
