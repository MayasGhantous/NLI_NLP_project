  i do n't understand the argument here , catholics are christians and they believe in jesus as gods son but jesus is in the new testament . 
  if i ca n't judge a text by reading the text , how else can i judge it ? 
  sorry , you are 100 % right , i tend to get that mixed up . 
  it 's not 100 % clear in the quran , it 's in the ahadith . 
  the closest the quran gets ( afaik ) is this 4:89 :  they but wish that ye should reject faith , as they do , and thus be on the same footing ( as they ) . 
  but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah ( from what is forbidden ) . 
  but ** if they turn renegades ** , seize them and slay them wherever ye find them ; and ( in any case ) take no friends or helpers from their ranks . 
  the question is of course : when did somebody turn renegade ? 
  not discussing semantics : you are right . 
  but your comment just shows that it 's not `` islamism '' ( whatever that means ) but that the people who keep others in line are just following what 's written in their holy books . 
  i think that 's a crucial difference , we ca n't just make up a boogeyman to explain their behaviour because we do n't like where it is actually coming from . 
  they repeated the mantra that all cultures are equal , they do n't think that there is a culture to change . 
  if the eu would n't try to shuffle illegal immigrants around that much this would n't have a leg to stand on . 
  how does that matter in this case ? 
  since you ca n't defend your argument this conversation is over . 
  you 're really misinformed . 
  [ was the islam of old spain truly tolerant ? 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/27/arts/was-the-islam-of-old-spain-truly-tolerant.html )  it 's a period in history where people are roaming around killing each other , what they had is pretty much hailed as a golden age , for that historical context no doubt there but it does n't change anything of what i said . 
   they were undermined by extremists in their own ranks exactly . 
  and what is an ( religious ) extremist ? 
  just a very religious person , a person that reads the holy book without the cherry-picking that the others use . 
   i do n't want to make the conversation go back , but i am bit underwhelmed by how poorly that seems to be taught in germany . 
  somebody that condescending can maybe finally answer my question about how this supposedly golden era can be contributed to the quran ? 
  so far we have come to the agreement that extremists contributed to it 's downfall so it was indeed the quran that ( partly ) caused the downfall . 
   a tribute creates a framework , like our visa system enables to pay extra tribute to the host nation . 
  not much more to say , what part do n't you get ? 
  so you would be ok if we started taxing muslims , not just immigrants but muslims and their kids and so on ? 
  you do n't need to run a history class here , all you need to do is explain how the quran enables peaceful ( not second-class citizens ) coexistance . 
  if it 's pretty self-explanatory you should n't have any problem explaining it . 
  in reality , jews and christians were second class citizens in al-andalus . 
  they had to pay special taxes and often had their own special dresscode . 
  i am not a christian so why bring up christians all the time ? 
  is that the old `` we have one problem , why not have two '' - approach ? 
  also , if the coexistence ( which was n't tolerant anyway ) was due to the quran , why do we see it nowhere else ? 
   read on the iberian peninsula before christians expelled the muslims . 
  christians and jews and muslims living together . 
  much of the science and tech that enabled the subsequent world explorations came from that islamic period . 
  they were also the ones that also preserved much of what we call `` european culture and civilisation '' . 
  we still have libraries in timbuktu that might hold translations of long lost `` european '' classics how did the ** quran ** enable this ? 
  which verses made this possible ? 
  i will ignore the condescending parts and hope you can show how this was an achievement of the quran . 
  you did n't specify what tax you were talking about . 
  you also did n't specify whether children of immigrants with a british passport had to pay the tax . 
  i agree with what you said about the quran ( in case that was n't a typo , not too sure ) but it does n't matter that we think it 's outdated since these people do n't think that . 
  i would love to see how the quran enabled peaceful coexistance . 
  any sources ? 
  what the christians did does n't matter for our topic . 
   of course they should teach it , but just not stop there . 
  what do you mean ? 
   people also pay extra taxes as immigrants in the uk . 
  i would love to have that removed as `` hate crime ''  what extra taxes to immigrants have to pay in the uk ? 
  also , please read the quran , it speaks very unfavourably about jews . 
  / edit : also : does this tax only target a certain type of immigrants ? 
  and does the muslim tribute exclude jews born in their country ? 
  your comment does n't fit at all . 
  the quran clearly states that jews have to pay a tribute if they want to life with muslims . 
  you do n't let equals pay a tribute for living with you . 
  that alone shows the anti-jewish sentiment in the quran . 
   showing slides about the holocaust is almost a stupid to immigrant kids as to germans born in the 21st century . 
  maybe we should be teaching kids born in 2003 about some other more recent tensions . 
  `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it '' - it 's actually even stupider to expect teachers to not teach children in europe about the biggest thing that happened in europe in the last 100 years . 
  i was talking where the hate comes from , you want to talk solutions . 
  fair enough , what can we do ? 
  we can stop acting like this is unexpected . 
  we can stop treating islam like just one of the other religions . 
  i agree that a proper school system needs to reach them all but whether a kid thinks that it 's parents are against jews or whether they think that god is against jews is a big difference . 
  i am , actually . 
  your argument is that i do n't know that they are muslims , seeing that they are of arab and turkish descent and that children are indoctrinated into the same religion their parents are a member of i deem it very highly to be the case though . 
  these groups rely heavily on distinctive cooking books , one of them uses much more pepper than the other and this is where the hate comes from . 
  just to see where this is going : muslims and jews . 
  judging by your post history your next question will be `` how do you know they are muslims ? 
  ca n't deduce that from the title yourself ? 
  contrary to popular believe we do n't only have books in schools . 
  if somebody follows a violent ideology they need to answer for it . 
  surprise surprise , these groups do n't get along , by definition . 
  a short google search turned [ this ] ( http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a18011/in-defense-of-daylight-saving-time/ ) up :  the fundamental misunderstanding of dst is a result of us americans ( humans , really ) being impatient and all too willing to miscalculate the the harm of short-term problems over subtle long-term benefits . 
  remember !, 
  dst is not the two days per year ( `` fall back '' and `` spring forward '' ) when we move our clocks around . 
  dst is eight months long ; those two days are the beginning and the end of dst . 
  to focus on just those two days is ridiculous , says david prerau , the author of seize the daylight : the curious and contentious story of daylight saving time and one of the world 's leading authorities on dst . 
  again : i never opposed that changing the time causes damage . 
  it 's 100 % unfounded . 
  proof that it is better to have only winter/summer time and then you wo n't hear the slightest bit of resistance from me . 
  the only thing i said is that i like it and that it might be beneficial . 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i am not disputing this , all i am saying is that you ca n't say one is better than the other if you only have data from one but not the other . 
  great , now take a comparable country and collect all the data and then we can talk . 
  you can only declare it madness if it is demonstrably worse than not changing the time . 
  you have proof that the act of changing the time once has undesireable outcomes but you have not proof one way or the other whether the overall outcome ( measured over the timespan of a year ) is worse since you have no data to compare it to because there is no data for a year that did n't see a time change . 
  you can advocate anything , but i thought we 're talking about statistically proving things ? 
  what you can prove is that there is an effect when you change the time . 
  what you ca n't proof ( yet ) is that the overall effect is worse than not having daylight saving . 
  the reason that you ca n't prove it yes is because you have no data on what would happen over the timespan of half a year without daylight savings time . 
  do you see the fundamental difference ? 
  and that you need to prove . 
  yes , but you need to compare that to the other system before you can say that the overall outcome is better/worse . 
  unless we have comparable data you ca n't say one is better than the other . 
  i am talking about comparing no-time-changes-system to the current time-changes-system . 
  you ca n't compare the two in terms of negative and positive outcomes until you had time to gather data on both systems . 
  since we do n't have comparable data on no-time-changes we ca n't say which one is better .
