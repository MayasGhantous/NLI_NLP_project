  i was answering to another comment . 
  that is n't really hard to see , the comment system is quite good . 
   germany deserves a bit of a break after the last year and a half . 
  that 's what i commented on . 
  how is it not fair that you have to put up with the consequences of your actions ? 
  i never talked about the two in the article . 
  namecalling , nice . 
  being born in a place does n't mean you share the values common in that place btw . 
   why are you assuming they are refugees , let alone immigrants ? 
  i did n't do that . 
  i do n't think i said that . 
  * pukes in a corner *, 
  sweden and germany were the most vocal about their wilingness to accept everybody . 
  so it 's at least kinda fair . 
  hahahaha, 
   germany deserves a bit of a break after the last year and a half . 
  you make the bed you lie in . 
  interesting , any links i can use to read more about this ? 
  or maybe a search term ? 
  sounds like a threat . 
  if they are fingerprinted , why are there immigrants who can get papers at multiple entry points ? 
  you forgot an important part of his comment , conveniently . 
  that 's the smartes thing i have heard him say all year . 
  i hope he was heard . 
  wow you people are annoying . 
  as a dude living in another country i agree . 
  not really , 
  while we are at it , is there a difference between norwegians and swedes ? 
  we should absolutely try to do that but we will have to close the doors really tight in the future . 
  unfortunately . 
  ah :d thought i missed something . 
  what ? 
  i really would like germany to understand what the internet is and how it works . 
  but muh clickbait, 
   blanket statements of this kind are simply inaccurate * ends his first comment with a blanked statement * you ca n't make this stuff up . 
  well , women are weaker . 
  certainly not less intelligent but weaker . 
  well i hope the creators will see some royalties ... 
  he should have kept it that way . 
  as if they would get a second referendum ... 
  i do n't think i want to model my life after a chinese vision . 
   and it has been refuted . 
  not wanting to be filmed is perfectly normal , period . 
  and i never said that it was n't . 
  since you continue to put words into my mouth this conversation is over . 
   i said that it is absolutely fine to cover your face when you do n't want to be filmed but since we are talking about demonstrations now : no , it is not perfectly fine to cover your face . 
  it is even forbidden by law to do that . 
  and as i said , it 's not normal , not that it is allowed or not totally fine , whatever that means . 
   well , the assumption in this case is that a group of people was hanging around who did n't feel like being part of a documentary sorry , but that 's just your assumption . 
  unless we know the full story it really does n't make sense to discuss about it any further . 
  and even in that case , i have never seen anyone putting on masks . 
   a general police presence and a personal police escort are two entirely different things . 
  did i say differently ? 
  i really do n't know what you are getting at in this part of the discussion , tbh . 
   your first claim was that it is not normal that people do n't like to be filmed and cover their faces no , again , do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i said putting on masks is n't normal , ** not ** that people possibly do n't want to be filmed . 
   which i refuted you made up a point and then * refuted * it . 
  that 's what it looks like to me . 
  i am still responding because i do n't like it when people try to make it look like i said things that i never did . 
   what 's your point ? 
  i think you that this behaviour is n't normal . 
  i have said it so many times now ... 
   http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/dresden-angriffe-auf-journalisten-bei-pegida-demo-1.2700619 i do n't know what you are getting at . 
  is that normal ? 
   ahh , yeah , it is incredibly likely he was in a place filled with people , not a place with maybe 5 to 8 people standing around . 
  unless you know you are talking out of your ass . 
  but there is obviously a sliding scale , a group of 100 has less issues with being filmed than a group of 5 . 
  but i actually do n't know if the law has a limit for the amount of people that have to be in a group . 
   you are the one who changed the goalpost from `` people covering their faces when a camera is out '' to `` but he read about a grenade attack in the newspaper ! '' . 
  no , you did when you said what you took away from the article . 
   well , it is obviously not a lawless area . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
   except that in this case he did n't go with the police , the police has a presence there anyway . 
  how horrible . 
  straw man ? 
  where did i say that it was horrible that the police was there ? 
  please try to stay on topic and do n't put words in my mouth if you do n't mind . 
   your flair says germany so ** you are talking out of your ass ** if you pretend like people here are alright with being filmed . 
   in this case it ** probably ** was n't a crowd though , but a specific group of people . 
  love the irony . 
  and i said in a crowd , not if you stick a camera in their face . 
   you know what , go out with a camera and start pointing it at a random group of 5 . 
  you know what , even better , you go to a random pegida rally and see whether people like being filmed . 
  i do n't live in germany anymore so that 's going to be bit hard for me to do but i seem to recall a lot of journalists covering pegida demonstrations with cameras . 
  i do n't think i saw a lot of masks there but i might be wrong . 
   well , he went there because he wanted to see what it 's `` really like '' and then starts talking about how horrible it is - a grenade attack he read about in the newspaper which he also could have read about from anywhere . 
  true , but you said was that `` the worst that can happen to you in sweden is ... '' not what the worst was that happened to him . 
  so please do n't change the goalpost . 
   factually ** he was not attacked by anyone ** , he did not get mugged and ** there was police presence ** which makes the apparently worst part of sweden even slightly better than the worst parts of other western countries . 
  i wonder whether that 's somehow connected . 
  do you know the video of the other film crew that went into little mogadishu and got attacked ? 
  they went there without police . 
   your point is pretty much that people covering their face in the presence of a camera is unacceptable . 
  please do n't put words in my mouth . 
  i said it 's not normal . 
   and as i literally said above that 's not what we are talking about . 
  you claimed above that most people do n't mind being filmed in a crowd , yes . 
   yes and it is perfectly normal that people do n't want to be filmed and therefore cover their face . 
  maybe it 's cultural differences but i have never seen anybody cover their face if they saw a camera in public ( except when they were up to something of course ) . 
   the worst thing that happened to him ** personally ** is that people covered their faces when he pulled out a camera .
