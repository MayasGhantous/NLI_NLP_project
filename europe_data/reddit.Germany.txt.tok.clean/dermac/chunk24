  giving all the power to one party alone should be classified as a con , i think . 
  thanks , but your argument already made sense , 
  fair enough , i was just curious , thank you . 
  i asked first . 
  any sources that say that the money actually arrived there ? 
  actually no , not into football and all that . 
  who is they ? 
  and how many ? 
  that 's what you get if you preach a book to your boys that tells them they are better than women and need to keep them in their place . 
  ah yes , the patriarchy ... a tool to continue to treat women like little children and men like evil monsters . 
  if you really think that you would also need to admit that that source is basically meaningless . 
  a bit more info is needed here . 
  what is defined as consent and what where the situations ? 
  maybe , but by 5000 people ? 
  or by some lone nutters ? 
  all i am saying is that 5000 people going out to protest is on another scale than somebody calling their lawyer to tell them that they are offenden ( which is childish ) . 
  yeah , i read up on that . 
  should have edited my first comment . 
  thanks anyway though !, 
  this post is about * perceived * immigrantion vs actual ( first-born ) immigration . 
  you are right that people born `` here '' are n't technically immigrants . 
  but minority social groups do exist and they are closer to their home country ( in their views ) than they are to `` here '' . 
  thus they are perceived as immigrants even though they are not . 
  ah yeah , did n't even catch that . 
  i was referring to your `` fuck off '' . 
  it means politically correct . 
  mostly people on the left focus on people saying politically correct things and people on the right are getting tired of it . 
  a good example is / u/bigbramel getting his panties in a bunch because somebody said something he does n't like . 
  bravo , good argument . 
  no profanity but just facts and reason . 
  i salute you . 
  that would be fair enough , but while the source says that  the man was not known to police and his motives are unclear , authorities said . 
  no group has claimed responsibility . 
  it also quotes a witness  lauretta said she heard the gunman say , `` allahu akbar , '' or `` god is great '' in arabic . 
  `` i know this because i 'm muslim . 
  i hear this and i only cry . '', 
  i guess the article is n't up to date then ? 
  why is n't it ? 
  5000 muslims in germany protested ( peacefully ) against the danish cartoons . 
  [ source ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohammed-karikaturen#internationale_proteste_mit_toten ) . 
  i have n't seen that big of a protest with regards to jokes about jesus or sports teams . 
  ok , i take your word for it , even though i am still sceptical . 
  thank you for your time and patience !, 
  does n't that still mean though that it * can * be a criminal offense now to misgender someone ? 
  you know what ? 
  i am thoroughly confused . 
  even this article that is titled [ bill c-16 -- no , its not about criminalizing pronoun misuse ] ( http://sds.utoronto.ca/blog/bill-c-16-no-its-not-about-criminalizing-pronoun-misuse/ ) says in one section :  non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression may very well be interpreted by the courts in the future to include the ** right to be identified by a person 's self identified pronoun ** . 
  the ontario human rights commission , for example , in their policy on preventing discrimination because of gender identity and expression states that gender harassment should include `` refusing to refer to a person by their self-identified name and proper personal pronoun '' . 
  in other words , pronoun misuse may become actionable , though the human rights tribunals and courts . 
  ** and the remedies ? 
  monetary damages , non-financial remedies ( for example , ceasing the discriminatory practice or reinstatement to job ) and public interest remedies ( for example , changing hiring practices or developing non-discriminatory policies and procedures ) . 
  jail time is not one of them . 
  ** as i am not a lawyer that is all i dare to say about this . 
  `` no , it 's not '' is not an argument . 
  what is this bill about , according to you ? 
  that is not what the bill says at all . 
  this is about how you have to address people , not whether you should service them . 
  on top of that this is open to all sorts of `` pronouns '' he/him/himself , xe/xim/ximself , rotor/rotim/rotorself , in case you are an apache helicopter . 
  so that bill has absolutely no effect ? 
  but i will be fined ? 
  and how is that not exactly what i said ? 
  please , correct me . 
  that made no sense . 
  so they want to restrict the cut off date for abortions from 16 weeks to 12 ? 
  that seems awfully long ... 
  i am pro abortion but 12 weeks seems much more reasonable from a developmental point of view than 16 . 
  did n't bill c16 just pass in canada ? 
  you now get a fine or even can go to jail if you do n't use the correct pronouns for people ? 
  i would n't say that number is vastly overestimated if they can make it into politics . 
   it will be a secular state with religious conservatism not very familiar with the lingo but how does this fit together ? 
  the way i understand it a religious conservative state is n't a secular one . 
  are there any other similar studies from former years ? 
  it would be nice to check whether there is a trend one way or another . 
  no worries , i do n't reddit on the weekend either   herbert bruecker of the iab institute for employment research said experience showed around 50 per cent of migrants the article makes a distinction between refugees and migrants . 
  there is a difference between refugees and skilled migrants from all over the world that had access to good school systems . 
   he said that would ** probably ** prove true of recent immigrants , especially as they were being offered more language courses and help from job centres and german people than in the past . 
  this is wishful thinking but not more atm . 
  i hope he is right but this is n't proof of anything . 
  the same study goes on to say that only 31 % of all refugees that arrived in 2013 got work . 
   the number of arrivals in 2016 will likely not hit 300,000 and the protection rate ( asylum + refugee status + subsidiary protection ) is around 60 % currently . 
  does that number include family reunification ? 
   this leaves us at around 200,000 accepted refugees . 
  accepting this amount of refugees also has the backing of the vast majority of germans . 
  we are talking about possible outcomes , not what the people want . 
   the deportation numbers are increasing significantly ( even though they are not at the level where they need to be ) . 
  here we can agree i think . 
  the whole asylum system would have broader acceptance if the people that are denied got deported more quickly . 
  the issue is though that you said most people , not some . 
  most would be about 550.000 mio people . 
  you are right , w\u00f6\u00dfmann was just speculating . 
  from that number i would think that a bit less than 50 % could join the workforce , but now i am just speculating . 
   apprenticeships do pay . 
  arguably the pay can be very shitty , but there is government support for this . 
  yeah , my bad , i mistook apprenticeship for internships , my bad , i apologize . 
   we have those that are completely unable to have a job due to unreliability or personality . 
  we have those that do not meet the requirements ( mainly in terms of commitment ) . 
  and we have those that simply do n't want a job because they simply do n't want to work and prefer algii . 
  while all of that is right i feel that it is just evading my question . 
   banning an entire group of people from entering your country because a minority of them do bad things is definitely reasonable . 
  conveniently forgetting the rulset for those people ...
