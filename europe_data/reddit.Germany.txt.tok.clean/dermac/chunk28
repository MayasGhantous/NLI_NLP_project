  of course we pay for life rescuing treatments . 
  insinuating that we would n't do that is the straw man . 
  if you bring `` mental health '' into the equation we need to pay for everything since you can just claim mental health problems if you do n't have the procedure in question done . 
  abortions can be life saving and in cases were they are they should be covered of course . 
  the rest should n't be , imo . 
  i wish you the best of luck !, 
   should we force her to pay for her life ? 
  that 's a really bad straw man . 
  denying somebody something and not paying for it are two different things . 
  / edit : apparently reddit thinks those two things are the same . 
  i do n't think that 's fair . 
  you are right , but why are n't we granting men the same freedom ? 
  if an accident happens the women can walk free at every stage along the way but a man is at the mercy of somebody else . 
  yes , because you are a sentient being , even if you are asleep or unconscious . 
  the same ca n't be said for a fetus right after abortion . 
  disclaimer : i am pro abortion but against having somebody else pay for it . 
  we know that nothing is free in this world , so who is actually paying for those abortions ? 
  this year it 's a forced injection of something we like , next year it 's a forced injection of something we do n't like . 
  what do you mean with papers already checked ? 
  who checked those papers ? 
  who processed their claims ? 
  who validated their claims ? 
  and most importantly , how do you make sure that nobody just walks in ? 
  what you are basically proposing is the old doing-nothing . 
  the australian model has shown that it safes lives and that it is possible . 
  that would be my prefered way of going forward , yes . 
  if we ca n't have that though i am for waht i said in my last comment . 
  i thought `` it '' was genital mutilation , my bad . 
  jews too, 
  well as long as they do n't remove the clitoris or sew * it * shut it should be allowed . 
  it 's their culture/religion . 
  we do allow it for boys too !, 
  is n't the whole point that less people drown if there is less incentive to come ? 
  not having the traffickers arrive will surely do that . 
  geez , i wonder where most of them came from and if there was a way to prevent it ... 
  your solution will cost more in man power over time as the influx of migrants will only grow over the coming years . 
  open sea borders also cost a lot of lifes each years as a lot of people drown when they have an incentive to reach their destination by boat . 
  my solution works , it 's not flawless , but it works . 
  there is n't a flawless solution here but allowing everybody in and then processing them has shown to not work . 
  people lie and people vanish and their alleged home country might not even take them back . 
   well but how would a wall help people with legitimate cliam to asylium ? 
  it would n't , that 's not the purpose of a wall . 
  they could apply for asylum at an asylum center outside the wall . 
   or people who quite easily climb over the wall ? 
  if you do n't go through the asylum centers you do n't have a claim asylum . 
   and how do you propose to build a wall in the middle of the mediterranean sea ? 
  we talked about your claim that walls do n't work , i never intended to solve the problem once and for all . 
   and there are way to know from were a person come even without document for example by the languge they speak where would you deport somebody to who speaks german ? 
  germany ? 
  switzerland ? 
  a wall is a much simpler solution and less resource intensive . 
  you method is open to all sorts of issues like lost passports . 
  it really depends on your definition . 
  if `` all forms '' includes chopping of the tip then no , not all forms are allowed . 
  but everything that 's foreskin related is fine , according to the law . 
  it is allowed because of religion and some other things also factor into it . 
  so nothing , diplomatic processes take years , if they work at all and you ca n't investigate the origin of somebody who is n't willing to tell you where he 's from and does n't have a passport . 
  you ca n't just deport them to wherever you think they are from , the host country would rightfully refuse if the person in question said that they are n't from that country . 
   society as a whole enforced that mindset and society as a whole will have to change it . 
  funny enough , [ this ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-30/bilnd-recruitment-trial-to-improve-gender-equality-failing-study/8664888 ) just came out :  the trial found assigning a ** male ** name to a candidate made them 3.2 per cent ** less likely ** to get a job interview . 
   adding a ** woman 's ** name to a cv made the candidate 2.9 per cent ** more likely ** to get a foot in the door . 
  so blind trials show that men are at a disadvantage when their gender is exposed , but the conclusion somehow is n't that we should actually do blind trials , to be fair , no , the conclusion is :  `` we should hit pause and be very cautious about introducing this as a way of improving diversity , as it can have the opposite effect , '' professor hiscox said . 
  diversity above all else , even if it goes against what 's best for a company . 
  if that does n't show society 's view on men i do n't know what does . 
  and if we do n't ? 
  and if they `` loose '' their passport ? 
  yeah , but that does n't mean it is n't criminal . 
  let 's say we do that . 
  what do we do with people who get turned away ? 
  sorry , i read over `` apart from the religious '' part . 
  my apologies . 
  but what i did n't say was that women decided that men are expandable , i said society did ( men and women ) . 
  so far we have governments that consist mainly of men and yet in the west , women have more rights than men ( like the right to genital integrity for example ) . 
  i do n't think comparing combat and work related deaths to the ratio of women in tech related fields is fair . 
  women have the same chances to get into tech jobs , it 's also not the point i was making . 
  my point is that many many more men die at their job than women do , yet that is n't something that the government tries to regulate . 
  that there are less women in comfy tech related jobs is apparently a big enough problem that the government needs to give women special advantages , just because they are women . 
  i would think that one sex is more likely to die at their job is a bigger problem than women not choosing to go into tech related jobs . 
   feminists do n't paint men as evil sexual predators either . 
  highly disagree . 
  everytime feminists talk about dmestic violence for example it 's always men that are the perpetrators but it 's actually 50 50 . 
  men also do n't get nearly as much social help as women do . 
  when the australien government did tell dv organisations they had to share the funds they received with male shelters ( of which there are very very few to begin with ) feminists staged a protest at the release of `` the suffragetes '' . 
  if they were for equality they would have helped male victims to begin with , without the government trying to interfere . 
  sorry , i did n't realise you were talking about adult people . 
  then it 's done with consent , obviously . 
  because the kid is too young to consent and influenced too easily . 
  that 's why we do n't allow tattoos and piercings up until a certain age . 
  what did i say that was factually wrong ? 
  is n't religion a major driver for male genital mutilation ? 
  are n't men seen as expendable as shown by the numerous deaths of men during work and military service ( compared to women ) with which nobody has a problem while not having fifty fifty women in stem is such a serious problem that governments are giving women advantages just for being women ? 
  are n't feminists painting men as evil sexual predators ? 
  tell me what i said that was factually wrong instead of just saying that you do n't like my rethoric . 
  yes , but that does n't mean it ca n't be controlled . 
  what surgeries are done without anesthesia ? 
  and you brought up open heart surgery . 
  yeah ? 
  what third world country are you from that open heart surgery is done without anesthesia ? 
  you did n't bring it up , you are right . 
  that does n't change my point though , bringing up fgm does n't change anything here unless you are willing to allow some forms of fgm .
