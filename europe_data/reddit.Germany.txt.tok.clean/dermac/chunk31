  on top of that , the author , is a known [ circumcision fetishist ] ( http://www.circumstitions.com/morris.html ) . 
  yes , punishment should go without saying . 
  you ca n't really prevent it but i think banning * all * genital mutilation would be a good start . 
  that 's my stance on it too . 
  since we get most of our views on americans from american tv i doubt that . 
  i have the feeling i am being trolled . 
  2012 , your link is from 2012 . 
  can you get something that is n't 5 years old ? 
  new research gets in all the time . 
  not trying to be cynical here , but you do know that people lie , right ? 
  sorry , i do n't get that argument , not that i disagree with it , on the contrary , but i do n't get what it has to do with what i wrote . 
  not even when they are big somali girls . 
  or girls of other ethnicities . 
  the / s also does n't indicate that i think it 's funny . 
  i actually thought you forget the / s. 
  otherwise , please explain how your measure would prevent female genital mutilation . 
  with your measure you can only detect if it already has happened but you ca n't prevent it . 
  to be honest , yes . 
  the pictures we get here are that americans are very prude and very religious and very anti masturbation . 
  i did n't mean to offend you , sorry . 
  so if the parents are muslims you take their kid away ? 
  again , they will not advertise that they are taking their daughter somewhere to have her genitals mutilated , so how will you determine which child to take away from her parents ? 
   it 's a useless piece of skin which serves no benefit . 
  absolutely wrong . 
   especially trying to compare a finger to an arm , when you 're trying to draw the analogy towards a human penis and vagina . 
  i am showing how illogical it is to say that something should be allowed just because it is less bad than something else . 
   female genital mutilation dissolves all sexual pleasure and satisfactions as i 've stated before from the female victim . 
  wrong again , there are different ways of cutting girls . 
   this goes for the various types of female genital mutilation but not all . 
  should those types of female circumcision be allowed ? 
   my sexual sensation/pleasure is intact , sexual function is intact , bodily reproductive mechanism and waste function is functioning properly as the organ was designed to do . 
  you have said that and i am happy for you that you think that but it is wrong . 
   the medical doctors in the united states already stand behind the fact that in terms of cleanliness ( hygiene ) it 's better than uncut dicks !, 
  cleanliness ? 
  well then better cut off your ears since that 's also better for hygiene . 
  also , even the aap ( american academy of pediatrics ) is backpaddleing on circumcision . 
  they are not saying it should be banned but that [ they dont ' universally recommend it anymore . ] ( https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/newborn-male-circumcision.aspx ) . 
  and that 's int he us where they earn money from it . 
   you have a decreased risk of urinary tract infections 1 % of boys get a uti at all . 
  [ to prevent one uti you need to mutilate 111 boys . 
   decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections source ? 
  because there is onlyt he one from uganda ( ? ), 
  as far as i know and it is heavily flawed . 
  also , condoms help better than mgm , so why not distribute condoms than chopping dicks off ? 
   also , a decreased risk of penile cancer according to the doctors [ `` in two studies , the protective effect of childhood/adolescent circumcision on invasive cancer no longer persisted when analyses were restricted to boys with no history of phimosis . 
  '' ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3139859/ ) nobody is talking about banning circumcision when it is medically necessary . 
  and please provide a source that fgm does n't increase hygiene , prevents uti , infections and cancer . 
  you made the claim it does n't so please prove it . 
   i 'm sorry , but if the medical experts are pro-circumcision , i 'll go ahead and listen to them . 
  they are n't . 
  again , even the apa does n't recommend it universally anymore . 
  and let me please attach a list , taken from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/69w0fs/norways_progress_party_calls_for_ban_on/dha1qmu/ ) , of ** professionals ** who are against it : * swedish pediatric society ( they outright call for a ban ) * royal dutch medical association * the netherlands society of general practitioners , * college of physicians and surgeons of british columbia * german association of pediatricians * president of the british association of paediatric urologists i actually got lazy copying from the link so please read the [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/69w0fs/norways_progress_party_calls_for_ban_on/dha1qmu/ ) how many professionals are against male genital mutilation . 
   so tell me again , why are you trying to paint and contrast male circumcision in the same light as female `` circumcision , '' especially with that poor analogy ? 
  because there are comparable forms . 
  and how would that prevention work ? 
  should they take away all children from somali parents ? 
  they do n't really go around saying `` now we are taking her somewhere to get her ` fixed ' '' . 
  i agree , but that does n't really matter . 
  if my religion said i should slaugther a cat every thursday to show my connection to god nobody ( rightfully so ) would give a damn about that . 
  if the law benefits people and it goes against your religion you should change your religion and not expect sympathy for your religion . 
  i get that you are not saying that , i would just like to point out that religion should n't play a role here , it 's not meant as a personal attack . 
  sweden ca n't do anything against that unless you think they should take the kids away from their parents . 
  what sweden can do is finally ban male genital mutilation . 
   it 's mostly uncircumcised females who are against circumcision . 
  just think about it , if circumcised females ( who are usually heads of their families ) would feel mutilated then they would not have done it to their daughters and the circle would have been stopped by now . 
  the whole thing is a political campaign to restrict religious practices trough legal the legal system . 
  ftfy, 
  so you are pro genital mutilation ? 
  100 babies die each year in the us due to curcumcision . 
  statistically speaking that 's only a few cases , yes , but i do n't think you should have the right to kill babies to have a procedure done on every boy that is without benefits . 
  i really ca n't tell . 
   i think we should dispel the notion that male circumcision is similar or has a similar aftermath as female circumcision there are different ways to cut girls ( just like there are different ways to cut boys ) and some of them are comparable to each other . 
  but even if they were n't , what kind of argument is that ? 
  `` cutting off a finger is n't as bad as cutting off an arm '' , i should therefore have the right to cut a finger off of my child '' . 
  you are right but i do n't see how that matters . 
  this is exactly why `` religious freedom '' has to go or at least should have a considerably lower standing in law . 
  `` if we put a ban on female circumcision they will just go somewhere else . '', 
  it 's actually likely that the pain shaped your brain and altered the person you are . 
  there are studies about that . 
  there are more men in sweden who are legally getting their genitals mutilated . 
  well they are trying to change country . 
  germany into turkey . 
  that 's not an agreed upon manifesto and more importantly , we do n't let people build schools to teach it to their children and allow them to push for changes according to it , do we ? 
  and where do we accept nazis building schools to teach that to their children ? 
  the difference being that there is no agreed upon nazi manifesto that tells you to hit your wife and kill gays and rewards you for it after you die . 
  a criminal is rewarded here for what he does . 
  take that away and he stops . 
  a believer ( of any religion ) will get a reward greater than anybody can imagine after he dies . 
  that is n't comparable . 
  it 's only `` weird '' if you ignore all other factors . 
  what 's being done here is that people are being given an unfair advantage because of their gender , to the disadvantage of somebody else . 
  normally we would call this sexism , but since the victims are male we do n't . 
   people put diversity on a higher level than human rights . 
  that 's sadly true . 
  i would like to add though that cutting girls ( rightfully ! ), 
  is forbidden even though it 's a part of some cultures so that should be allowed to under that argument ( it should n't ) . 
  i know all that and it is a horrible and shameful practice but it is already forbidden in sweden . 
  male genital mutilation is n't but somehow the forbidden genital mutilation gets way more spotlight than allowed mutilation . 
  can we tackle all sorts of genital mutilation or is it somehow important that we take only care of the girls ? 
  yeah , but still , this only works if you wrongly think religion and race are the same .
