  let 's continue with this : you allow the nazis to move in and spread their views . 
  by time you realize that there are more and more murders of jews . 
  these murders are perpetrated by a tiny minority of the nazis . 
  would you not try to go against supporting the views they hold because of the consequences this has on lifes and your community ? 
  i think the fundamental difference between us is that you think that these people will somehow accept that `` our '' culture is `` better '' ( like more rights for everybody ) whereas i think that they are happy with their religious society ( because they believe it is the will of god ) and will try to impose their way of living on other people as is mandated in the quran . 
  until you accept that supporting a worldview and spreading it are n't disconnected from one another . 
  then she has to accept that it is forbidden because most muslim women do n't want to wear it but are forced to . 
  it is the same with people that want to go to the beach naked . 
  we do n't allow it on most beaches . 
  to the disadvantage of people who want to do it . 
  some people also want to wear swastikas because it means something different to them . 
  that is forbidden ( in germany at least ) as well . 
  as only muslim women wear it to show their modesty there are two possibilities : they do n't wear it out of their own free will or every other woman is n't modest . 
  i always wonder why people would think that women wear this out of their own free will . 
  only muslim women do it , does that mean that only muslim women are modest ? 
  what is done to gender equality in the name of tolerance makes me want to puke . 
  i am really not big on the feminist movement nowadays but to sell this as a right that women should have because some women ( despite evidence to the contrary ) * choose * to wear it is just an insult to everyones intelligence . 
  fair enough . 
  and would you support them spreading their world view ? 
  muslim women want to show their modesty . 
  non-muslim women are also want to show their modesty . 
  muslim women cover up . 
  non-muslim women do n't cover up . 
  so as both groups are modest but only one covers up i doubt that is of their own will because if it was we would see a more even distribution between the groups . 
  muslim women want to show their modesty . 
  non-muslim women are also want to show their modesty . 
  muslim women cover up . 
  non-muslim women do n't cover up . 
  so as both groups are modest but only one covers up i doubt that is of their own will because if it was we would see a more even distribution between the groups . 
  if you and all the men in your culture do it and swarm places where it is ok to show your chest then yes . 
   most of the time it 's women who ** grow up in a sexist culture ** who wear these things ** voluntarily ** though . 
  these two things really do n't go together . 
  nice idea but hardly practical . 
  `` i did n't tell her to wear it , she chose to wear it herself ! '', 
  how often do * you * see ninjas bathing ? 
   five people were injured and ** several cars burned . 
  ** ah , the french pastime . 
  interesting , i always thought they started building from the top !, 
  that 's an interesting question . 
  if the person has another citizenship , why not . 
  that would only be fair . 
  / edit : maybe people born in the country should keep their citizenship ( including non-ethnic germans ) ? 
  i am not sure on that . 
  but it has to be fair , of course . 
   because germany decided that a whole group of people were n't guaranteed protections as citizens . 
  on the other hand , if an inflammatory speaker had then been removed from society millions would n't have died . 
  and you should probably look up the definition of the literally . 
  pretty simple : the person then has only one citizenship and that ca n't be taken . 
   because applicable . 
  how so ? 
   is the guy a terrorist ? 
  because last time i checked it 's ok to invalidate a citizenship that was applied for in bad faith , but not for saying something inflammatory that has nothing to do with nationalism . 
  i am not in the business of deciding on what grounds citizenship can be revoked . 
  all i am saying is that it is a possibility . 
  and btw , what has nationalism to do with the decision ? 
   changing the law to be able to remove citizenship based on `` inflammatory statements '' is dangerous and subject to too much abuse . 
  the law would need to be pretty clear on what grounds citizenship can be removed , yes . 
  maybe `` imflammatory statements '' is not enough , maybe it is . 
  that is not for me to decide though . 
  ah , you are talking about people who only have one citizenship . 
  i would agree with your point then , you ca n't take someones citizenship if it leaves the person stateless . 
  but this is about people having dual citizenship . 
  that 's why i asked whether he holds another citizenship . 
  and you just say that without any justification . 
  the state is also responsible for the other 99.9 % . 
  we abolished the death penalty , which is a good thing . 
  that leaves us with sending him away ( stripping of citizenship ) or living with the outcome of this persons work . 
  like indoctrinating others into thinking that sex slaves are ok or that homosexuals should be killed or that unbelievers are worth less than believers . 
  personally i think that the states job here would be to protect the 99.9 % who do n't have horrible views . 
   and i would think someone from germany would be well aware of how such abuse can look like . 
  yada yada appeal to nazi past , yada yada . 
  citizenship is n't given on bigger grounds than that . 
  take it from somebody who is applying for another citizenship . 
  isreal has taken citizenship from terrorists , denmark is thinking about doing it . 
  this is not my idea . 
   and i do n't recall any law which states that if a person does some type of thing that they are subject to losing citizenship . 
  there might not be any law , but laws are subject to change all the time . 
  how does it make the problem worse ? 
  and how is it a human rights violation ? 
  yes . 
  / edit to clarify : citizenship can be given on the grounds of good behaviour . 
  i do n't see why it ca n't be taken from a person on the grounds of bad behaviour then . 
  it 's only seriously damaging if you do n't stick your head in the sand when evidence surfaces . 
  which is something voters do n't do , apparently . 
  is n't advocating a crime a crime itself ? 
  does he have another citizenship ? 
  as far as i read the source they will talk about his proposal on the 18 . and 19 . 
  as there are a few good ideas ( removal of citizenship in case of hate crimes , more funding for the police , burqa ban ) i hope they will talk about it point by point and not treat it as a `` take it all or leave it all '' situation . 
  ** tl ; dr ** they will talk about it on the 18th/19th, 
  would be nice . 
  seems also logical . 
  but i do n't believe it before it actually happens . 
  you can have dual citizenship and he wants to get rid of it . 
  agreed , but it should be possible to take somebodies citizenship if they commit atrocious crimes ( and are n't born in the country ) . 
  denmark did that for example so i think it is possible under eu rules . 
  but i am not an expert on that topic . 
  according to this [ source ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/sicherheitsgesetze-103.html ) , it 's only him who wants to get rid of dual citizenship . 
  the government said they have no plans to change the dual citizenship laws . 
  i really really hate that guy . 
  loosening patient doctor confidentiality is already fucking bad but abolishing dual citizenship ?
