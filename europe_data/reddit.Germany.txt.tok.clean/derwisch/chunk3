  incarceration rate is a good deal higher in the u.s. than in russia ( where it is pretty bad still ) . 
  .7 per cent of the populace is not neglegible . 
   iran-contra would be one example . 
  mujaheddin come to mind . 
  i love watching the last 15 minutes of never say never again . 
  or saddam , as long as he was fighting iran and the kurds . 
  i clicked on gf link b/c i expected to hear his speech on the ukraine crisis . 
  in which he condemns the russian invasion as being at odds with international law . 
  he was very unquiet in the process . 
  bbc giving [ pro-russian ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/74312000/jpg/_74312677_74310987.jpg ) and [ pro-western ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/74312000/jpg/_74312679_74312678.jpg ) ukrainians a face . 
  good to know how to distinguish between them . 
  as a straight male , i know who i like better . 
  the [ propaganda piece linked here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22rx7m/russias_accusations_setting_the_record_straight/ ) has friendlier things to say about the treaty than this contemporary article . 
  the gdp of russia was lower in 1994 than in 1993 , it took a bit longer to recover from the collapse , and a great deal of the recovery is attributed to putin . 
  i would think that part of the reasons why ukraine got to sign a favourable treatment was them forfeiting nukes . 
  this is one major reason i do n't like where this is going . 
  ukraine was one of the few countries that embraced nuclear disarmament , and in the long run it seems to have affected them adversely , which sets a bad example . 
  you are correct in that ( apart from the `` unspoken '' bit ) yet the original question was about the hate , and hate may be justified over broken promises , even if no treaty was signed . 
  not denying that but i 'd be more suspicious if comment sections were riddled with pro-russian propaganda written by people who only make anti-russian comments . 
  where did you get the impression from that die linke is siding with russia in the conflict ? 
  thing is that russia is nowadays blamed for breaking contracts they signed during their time of collapse . 
  that being said , i think it 'd be too much to ask for to have a translation which covers all meanings of the original word . 
  hm , that 's a shame , but i think that there 's no flag for humanity , at least none which would n't identify you with some international body . 
   they do n't have a legitimate claim to asylum . 
  i ca n't help juxtaposing this sentence to your anarchist flag flair . 
   us-mexican border : again , this is about refugees not immigrants as op said , if you flee your country for reasons of war you are a refugee . 
  if you flee from war on drugs you do n't count as a refugee ? 
  some mexican regions have a higher death toll than iraq . 
  plus i would tend to think the u.s. will generously accept people from venezuela as refugees . 
  correct . 
  the canary islands geographically belong to africa . 
  why the arrows ? 
  is the trajectory by which the money was transmitted of significance ? 
   stalin wanted nice borders possibly between different countries but not between different soviet republics . 
  the ussr constitution made it easy for single soviet republics to dissociate , but economic relations ( allegedly an estonian plant would produce right shoes and a kazakh plant left shoes ) and [ convoluted borderlines ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/40.206/71.312 ) made sure it would n't be too easy . 
  from the top of my head i could think of goralian , ruthenian , german , and kashubian . 
  given that the topography makes it so easy to settle in or occupy poland , i was surprised that at the end of the cold war 94 per cent of the population within the polish border were referred to as ethnic polish . 
  i remember that bulgarian who told me that they took everything away from his country . 
   economic affairs minister brigitte zypries not quite , that would be sigmar gabriel . 
  she is [ parlamentarische staatssekret\u00e4rin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_of_state#germany ) . 
  they 'd finally be able to properly host admiral 's cup . 
  i think the atrocities of war are more present in the older generation ( afghanistan vets , wwii stories ) . 
  yeah , children learn for life . 
  not exactly live ( i followed scenes in full daylight when it should be 21:00 in moscow ) . 
  no conspiracy theory needed here . 
  you needed no clairvoyance to see that things would get messy after yanukovich got toppled . 
  to sell the whole stock of the company you are chairing is an ugly matter regardless if there was inside info . 
  * edit * shares got sold before yanukovich 's resignation . 
  yet there was high likelihood that things would get messy either way . 
  if every politician with interests in the matter would shut up , it would be a quiet issue . 
  so many figures are rounded to the same amount that one has to wonder about sample size . 
  the `` retire '' bit was quite correct though as his presidency was seen as a merkel move to get rid of a competitor . 
  rau was a very influential politician but old when he finally became president . 
  heu\u00df , l\u00fcbke , scheel , herzog , k\u00f6hler were not , heinemann , carstens , v. weizs\u00e4cker only arguably so . 
  i did n't indicate that . 
  only that working towards common goals in europe is hard to accomplish with either . 
  or to put it another way : the eu partliament will have quite a share of `` unsavoury characters '' without having to extend to ukraine . 
   yes there 's some bad on both sides - but the end goal for the western ukraine side is integration with the rest of europe - and that should mean less corruption , better opportunities , more democracy and civil rights - so i 'm prepared for the west to work with some unsavoury characters to get there . 
  my fear is that the upcoming elections will let the european parliament resemble the ukraine government . 
  all-out anti-semite parties have become stronger in various european countries . 
  add to that the `` euro-sceptics '' in uk , finland , and netherlands ( there 's a reason that no party in the knesset may have the abolition of the state israel as an ultimate goal ) and you will see how endorsing that merry band as a legitimate government will backfire . 
  i 'd be surprised if a country had established rules on how to lose parts of it . 
  for instance , article 23 in german grundgesetz establishes how other regions may join the country ( which was relevant during the mergers of saarland and east germany ) but there is no prescription on , say , bavaria how to separate from the country . 
  after browsing a little i actually am surprised to find that the constitutions of the ussr allowed the secession of its member states from the union . 
  the ukrainian constitution does n't seem to provide that liberty . 
  it did count as long as we unambiguously sided with the mujahedeen and cheered for every helicopter hit with a stinger missile . 
  for a historic account of the official view of the situation , see how sean connery sided with the true muslims in `` never say never '' . 
  as early as 1989 at tiananmen , banners [ in english ] ( http://brushduck.com/2011/02/27/the-protest-that-didnt-happen/ ) were seen . 
  it 's frequently done by protesters to get their message across internationally . 
  protests against a bill which would change the colour of p\u00f8lsen sausage would be uttered in danish . 
  thing is the chancellor never speaks out . 
  after having a relative as an in-patient for a neurological check up in a renowned german hospital i can testify that failure on an organisational level can cost patient four days and long waiting hours . 
  the situation that stresses most people out can be described as a bisection of human beings into people that are busy with work up to their collar and people killing their time waiting for attention . 
  plus it is the birthplace of robert gernhardt . 
  my 10yo son . 
  * that * kind . 
  i so want to walk the mala fatra !, 
  i like subalpine mountains best , the region which is walkable without risk of falling down a gorge but high enough to lack trees and offering views . 
  the region in germany which comes closest is the [ rh\u00f6n ] ( http://www.weitwanderungen.de/images/rhoen-landschaftsweite.jpg ) . 
  wonderful cityscapes make up for it . 
  i am not familiar with campaigns by the west or east german govt . 
  against dialects but my father-in-law had massive difficulties learning the language they taught at school , so massive that he refused to talk platt with his children . 
  but formalities do n't go that far back as wods for day , apple , or house , therefore very often different words are used in similar languages for things like hello , thank you and how are you . 
  case in point : obrigado vs gra\u00e7ias . 
  i assumed another slavic language . 
  andorra made me chuckle . 
   i would n't want to see an abwehra agent as a kanzler of germany ... that was the quote i responded to . 
  i do n't think my response is invalidated by the amount of influence of the secret service . 
  it 's not as if a vice chancellor of germany had a more influential secret service to choose from on his career path . 
  i do n't doubt that andropov , bush and putin were more influential in their respective positions . 
  klaus kinkel was chief spy in west germany and became vice chancellor in united germany later . 
  generally comes in handy if you feel you have to make up for small numbers . 
  what does the colour scheme of the chart signify ? 
  there 's a fair share of christian palestinians , though it is shrinking . 
  in a german 1990 's detective story series , when the officer with a gdr upbringing experienced something unpleasant on the street : `` and * that 's * what we have been standing behind the curtain for in 1989 ? '', 
  well i hope \u0662\u0660\u0661\u0663 has been a good year for you , habibi . 
   schiff has been described as the greatest musician hungary has produced since the composers bela bartok and zoltan kodaly , in the first half of the 20th century .
