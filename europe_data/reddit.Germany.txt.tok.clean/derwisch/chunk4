  the catch was that the boy was white and blonde , did not look like a gypsy at all . 
  revealed my racial connotations to me . 
  better one : ecuador , france , and honduras . 
  take a good look at the grocery section of your supermarket , especially in the upcoming winter . 
  i once read in a us tourist guide that washing lines are a sign that you are entering amish country . 
  the first minute foul by vogts was outside the box , so that kinda cancels out . 
  try learning german when your mother tongue is czech . 
   germany 's rugby team is in group 1b of the european nations cup . 
  this is hardly a well known fact in germany . 
  the late georg kreisler can relate . 
  it is not that un started their investigations without a cause . 
  they were under the impression that the dutch government filed an application for recognition of sinterklaas as intangible cultural heritage . 
  otherwise , the un would not give a damn about racist connotations . 
  in their answering letter , the dutch government denied that such an application was underway . 
  [ dressing up in racial stereotypes ] ( http://www.losanjalis.com/?p=404 ) [ is a touchy subject ] ( http://torontoist.com/2009/11/a_lesson_on_blackface/ ) in some cultures . 
  when alemannic groups are trying to file fasnacht with unesco we 'll see how [ antisemite nursery rhymes ] ( http://www.hagalil.com/archiv/2010/02/08/fastnacht/ ) will be received . 
  prague , vienna and budapest are too closely related culturally . 
  op is asking for more variety . 
  any one of the three should be included in a 10 days europe tour , i agree . 
  i 'd mix these with c\u00f3rdoba / granada . 
   make z the letter for the voiced s there are clear pronounciation rules for s , i do n't see a necessity in changing that . 
   as in any other language funny how the s in `` as '' is voiced , isnt ' t it ? 
  any other my as . 
  possibly , i could n't read it out loud anymore though . 
  i even struggle with russian texts when the diacritic dots above the e are dropped . 
  languages with strict pronounciation are great stuff . 
  the late [ werner icking ] ( http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cdeqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2ficking-music-archive.org%2f&amp;ei=gqltuvuxhkwg4asj0ig4ca&amp;usg=afqjcng3qbblrg1mydkdklh-x3pfaljm4w&amp;bvm=bv.53537100,d.yms&amp;cad=rja ) once related how he read out hungarian children 's books . 
  although he did n't understand a thing the kids clung unto his lips . 
   germany 's credit rating would not be endangered , because eurobonds would compare favorably with bonds issued by other major countries . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  while silicon valley is right-leaning , with hardly any immigrants ? 
  that was n't my impression when i visited . 
  that approach was sold 50 year ago as `` policy of high chimneys '' . 
  need n't really be pointed out to someone with a portuguese flag . 
  personally , i can read out czech or slovak faster than polish as diacritical marks are easier to parse for me than letter combinations . 
  my mother tongue would benefit from a \u0161 too , sch is awkward . 
   greece was then at about the same level as romania ; now its performance is several times better . 
  those were the days ... 
   also i think europeans would be pleasantly surprised by the beer market in the us these days . 
  indeed . 
  my brother-in-law has a soft spot for everything homegrown and organic , and the beers he served me were one-of-a-kind . 
  i 'd be hard pressed finding anything like it around here in germany . 
  hansa pils , affectionately named hansaplast . 
  that said , the malt beer is actually good , not so sweet like vitamalz . 
  had no idea about the background but posted it anyway b/c i was interested precisely in the background comments that you 've given here . 
  thanks r/europe !, 
  and the karma does n't hurt either . 
  we 've been on summer vacation to lisbon and our impression was that economic hardship does not translate to racist groupings like golden dawn down there . 
  yeah , and that the environmentalist/communist alliance abbreviates cdu is too good to be left out of a headline . 
  as a german i love the hammer and sickle icon next to the letters c , d and u on an election campaign poster . 
  that the local candidate 's last name was judas is just the icing on the cake . 
  what 's it with belgium being white ? 
  as far as i know the german-speaking community in east belgium is among the most pampered minorities in europe . 
  but as we know , correlation does not imply causation . 
  certainly , but the quest was for hits in our native country sung in our native language ( and falco made some attempt to avoid dialect so native language is fair game here ) . 
   the left-wing candidate is too boring too appeal to the public gregor gysi is actually quite entertaining . 
  and steinbr\u00fcck is not left-wing . 
  the sequence in which the `` non-representative '' candidates fill the seats assigned to a party is not negotiable by voting . 
  a temporary party affiliation as in the u.s. during the campaign , in which the lists are decided upon , would be an improvement . 
  the actual emboursement scheme is a lot more complicated it seems , but 85 cent per single vote is a good guidepost . 
  and your nick does not fit your comment very well . 
  exit polls are not too reliable , extrapolations based on actual results are more precise . 
  the greens would better think twice about following the examples of the two former merkel coalition partners . 
  parties get tax money based on the number of votes if they get at least 1 per cent . 
  this is peanuts for industry-backed parties but huge for small parties like pirates or npd . 
  considering you can contribute to the political process outside parliament ( like the pirates could throw crypto parties ) , one could argue that your vote was n't completely pointless . 
  to expand : capitalise on the devaluation of the euro brought about by economically less successful member states . 
  works until the next general election . 
  what does the lithuanian word for poland mean ? 
  the biggest copper-processing furnace in germany . 
   i guess it 's the harbours but hamburg . 
  moar shopping malls . 
  `` terrorists '' are what you are left with if you are not allowed to have an army . 
  not chinese . 
  not gon na happen . 
  why english ? 
   `` encul\u00e9 '' , `` fils de pute '' ( son of a whore ) these words came to my attention during the last football world cup . 
  `` schlickef\u00e4nger '' for a slimy , devious person . 
  `` heiopei '' for a non-observant person . 
  in germany you only can get `` augenkrebs '' ( oog kanker ) for looking at 1995ish bigfoot.com style websites with stark contrasts , blinking tags and marquees . 
  `` sch\u00f6nen tag noch '' is much more common , `` guten tag '' as `` bonne journ\u00e9e '' must be a thing of 100 years ago . 
   bonn yes , i would like to see a variant of the map where bonn is the capital . 
  people bitch a lot about brussels but nearly half of the germans live closer to it than berlin . 
  that 's where i switched off . 
  prospect engineers should have better ways with numbers . 
   that 's a lot of playful words !, 
  it 's a shame they are lost . 
  that 's not even playful : stuiver is an old currency unit , and dubbeltje is , well , two stuivers . 
  kwaartje would have survived if they 'd introduced a 25 cents coin , a ` riks ' is short for ` rijksdaalder ' ( imperial dollar ) . 
  oh , and the official abbreviation for guilder was fl . 
  so it 's more history than slang terms that was tossed . 
  in west germany , groschen or tacken was 0,10 dm and heiermann was 5 dm . 
   a few dozen demonstrators compared to the size of the town this is not too much . 
  twenty years ago you could see [ large demonstrations ] ( http://loveparade.techno.de/geschichte/loveparade1993.html ) about the issues berliners really care about . 
  [ keepvogel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwxhj3ghpg ) is the one cartoon that i wish it existed when i was little . 
   we have some of the worst bike lanes in all of europe i think i thought this trophy would go to worrington . 
  did n't know that so many redditors are single parents . 
  some 20 years ago on a cycle tour to poland and lithuania we camped near the river of nemunas , which forms the border to the russian exclave . 
  about midnight we were picked up by a lithuanian border patrol and escorted to their army base , where we had to spend the rest of the night . 
  the commander of the base , in his main job school director ( which did n't pay enough ) , was really apologetic about all that but insisted we could n't camp near the border , and that he was obliged to impose a fine of ~ 6 eur on the both of us .
