  as eu citizens we had unlearnt to take borders seriously . 
  did n't sound like the parliament was involved . 
  being discriminated against in monaco must feel different from being discriminated against in russia . 
   the horse is fine , why do we need a car ? 
  cars have longer ranges and generally more load capacity than horses . 
  horses have an edge in rough terrain . 
  it all depends on circumstances . 
  plus iirc the operator accepts interrail passes . 
  during the last bends it is impossible not to sing `` we all came down to montreux '' . 
  i remember being in awe about glasgow - ft william . 
  [ miljoenenlijn ] ( http://zlsm.nl/site/ ) is spectacular for dutch standards . 
  not the most recent bills though . 
  the colourful bills used in the 1980s made me jealeous . 
  boundaries do n't run between countries but between top and bottom . 
  this is a notion that wo n't catch on for quite some time . 
  interesting , did n't know that . 
  and 25000 $ would be considered a steal down here in the south west . 
  on a related note , 10 per cent provision is quite steep for an area `` no one wants to live in '' . 
  on january 2nd , 2002 , i got handed french coins -- near the town of nordhausen in the middle of germany . 
  sagt man vielleicht , but you do n't see it in newspaper headings or train schedules . 
  do you really use that word for every cucumber no matter the size ? 
  yes , it is well known among the theology collegiate in regensburg . 
  the french far right makes sure there is pork in the food they hand oout . 
  town of my ancestors . 
  i loved the bit about sheffield in levycka 's < sp ?  * caravan * , where the one guy goes to sheffield thinking it is worker 's paradise , and someone else tells him it 's a huge dump , and he goes to find out that it 's really something in between . 
  subtle alterations . 
  i like . 
  the insitution sounds like they are native russian speakers . 
  got it  so what 's honey in czech ? 
  that 's overall mortality , not only of cervical cancer . 
  generally a high death rate of cancer is a sign taht people live long enough to experience cancer and die from it . 
  most se african women are not so lucky , i 'd estimate the cervical cancer death rate to be lower than in eastern europe . 
  [ klageweib ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/klageweib ) is even a word in german . 
  netherlands has a rather poor network density ( see belgium for comparison ) , but the frequency of service is quite nice over there . 
  so if you happen to live near a station you 're set . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.pigor.de/getcmsdata.php?id=398&amp;category=hoeren ), 
  i was in finland in 1986 and english was far from dominant as a second language . 
  seemed to me that swedish was most prominent , followed by english , russian , and some german . 
  sweden definitely brought a vast amount of fluent speakers of english into the eu . 
  finland , much less so . 
  also , the switch from german to english in prague in the 1990 's was most possibly caused by those americans who chose prague as the new hip place to live , and the lack of east germans . 
  how would a national firewall prevent that , other than by shutting down the entire connection ? 
  there 's a movement in [ luxembourg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_luxembourg#flag_discussion ) to change to a more zoologist flag . 
  hey , without equestrian and canoeing we wo n't make any medals !, 
  have you read the article ? 
  that was exactly what i gathered reading it . 
  that argument has repeatedly been brought forward by helmut schmidt , for instance . 
  as my mother says , a lot of people did n't know , but everyone could have known if they had n't looked the other way . 
  the matter is so atrocious that denial goes a long way . 
  of course it 's taboo . 
  in our country it is an offense to question the holocaust ( unlike 9/11-truthers , creationists etc. ) . 
  that 's why ahmadinejad retaliated against muhammad caricatures ( and western mockery of `` easily offended '' muslims ) by publicly disputing the historic truth of the holocaust . 
  gives a new perspective on how people `` coudld n't have known what happened '' . 
  it 's not that easy to hide if committed in more different places . 
  in case of the holocaust , i 'd rather call an article propaganda if it debated the pros and cons of exterminating other tribes . 
  ( just looked it up ) extermination camp . 
  we german voted worse when in economic slump . 
  [ atlas of german usage compiled from internet surveys ] ( http://www.atlas-alltagssprache.de/runde-2/f11/ ), 
  he wanted his party to give him some `` legroom '' , apparently in order to kick anyone else 's shins . 
  yes you can . 
  some doctors are quick to certify that granny slipped in the bathtub and hit her head . 
  some op-ed on the closedown of forensic medicine institutes in germany estimated the reported rate at 50 per cent . 
   this is why vietnamese is my favorite asian language . 
  bahasa melayu/indonesia all the way . 
  vietnamese would looke nice if someone got to pull all these acupuncture needles from the letters . 
  i like the german word `` hubschrauber '' too , if only for the days when the language was still inventive enough to coin new terms . 
  that 's already [ taken ] ( http://dict.leo.org/?lp=ende&amp;from=fx3&amp;search=schneebrett ) . 
  voiced ? 
  i 've been doing it wrong then . 
  utrecht and maastricht are holy german empire cities though , and less specifically dutch than , say , leiden or delft . 
  i always associate the netherlands with the golden age cities . 
  finnish , to me , is a language which can compete with italian for it 's pleasantness to listen to . 
  slovak is to me a slav language done right . 
  no cyrillic alphabet , alphabetisation recent enough for good congruence between written and spoken language , easier to pronounce than czech and polish . 
  someone has called slovak `` the slav esperanto '' in that it is the language best understood by fellow slav languages . 
  a slovak girl once related that , when abroad , she tried to get home news from short wave radio ( before current ubiquity of the ` net ) . 
  obviously , am radio has some transmission quality issues , especially it is hard to fine-tune in order to get the hissing noises out of the talk . 
  when she failed to remove the hissing noises she 'd realize she hit polish radio by mistake . 
   from personal experience i have met many of polish natives from east of krakow who were required to learn german before english in high school . 
  i did n't know that , and i would say that english would be more useful . 
  in zielona g\u00f3ra it 'd be different . 
   i do n't think danish is similar enough to german for them to be intelligible with another , dutch is another story . 
  ca n't say much about it as i have spent many a holiday in the netherlands but hardly ever went to denmark . 
  but i 'd think that three months of intensive training and immersion in the country would let me catch up a lot wrt language skills . 
  the same time in the czech republic , much less so . 
  swiss people who have to learn german as a second language at school are often frustrated how little use their knowledge is when they try to talk with their compatriots . 
  and schwiizert\u00fc\u00fctsch has [ no common standard ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bahnhofbuffet_olten#bahnhofbuffet-olten-dialekt ) suitable for teaching . 
  for denmark and netherlands , german is close enough a language that people will pick it up when they really need it , not that pressing a need to teach it in school . 
  some polish regions are quite distant from german borders . 
  czech republic , in contrast , shares most of its borders with german-speaking countries , and many people will seek jobs ( even if it 's just summer jobs ) in those countries . 
   law which bans horses as means of transportation what 's next ? 
  a law banning slide rules ? 
  more slovak than czech people speak german ... 
  i 'd think that czech republic would be the one country where learning german makes sense geographically . 
  i would love it if butchers were selling horse meat over here !, 
  pity your shamans forgot to tell you that , 65 yrs later , access to germany [ would n't be that easy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lechfeld ) . 
  i shudder at the prospect of the french population even resemble the german , let alone match . 
  sorry , could n't find a better ( more english ) source . 
  in terms of reliability , this site as quite a good track record . 
  our education system aims at a standard of english that allows you to get understood , not to speak so immaculate as to act condescendingly to your countrymen .
