  dashes are for wimps . 
  anyone joining the [ ironman ] ( http://www.fr-online.de/marathon/ironman-in-frankfurt-ironman-droht-hitze-stopp,1473466,31106530.html ) in frankfurt ? 
  thanks , and i do n't know why you were downvoted . 
  [ where 's the difference to orban 's campaign ? 
  ] ( http://www.vocativ.com/world/australia-world/australia-asylum-ad/ ), 
  a slight inconsistence as once h is transliterated as \u0413 and on another occasion as \u0425 . 
   diev\u010da as in the song `` diev\u010datko oravsk\u00f4 '' ? 
   oh , and also the use of plastic bottles has n't declined . 
  at all . 
  but the amount of litter in whatever people use for picnic has declined . 
  twenty years ago there were beer cans everywhere . 
  race cyclists on the sidewalk ? 
  ok , there seems to be a problem i have n't been aware of . 
  not bad , but / u/seadge was talking about nazi german concentration camp . 
  your first example refers to a camp no sane person would call a nazi german concentration camp . 
  ( at least it was operated at a time when the colours of the reich were black , red , and gold , i have to hand you that one . ), 
  no , it 's a nationalist located in poland . 
  ok , this seems to be a well-researched matter as i am learning so you can certainly back up that statement . 
  name a source from may 2011 and from june 2013 , please . 
  quota have not been determined yet but are under negotiation . 
  if you have 15 per cent refugees you should get some `` discount '' . 
  but that 's a big `` if '' . 
  i doubt that all 15 per cent have refugee status . 
  come on now . 
  there are deep rifts between basque and castilian tribes , yet spain would encounter roaring laughter when they tried it to enter the equation on how refugees are distributed . 
  i think you get a bonus based on how many refugees you have already accepted as a country . 
  brussels is itself an ethnically much more diverse place than latvia . 
  i 'd be surprised if the percentage of flamish and waloons was higher in brussels than of latvians in latvia . 
  do n't think of brussels as of some monolithic brasilia in the middle of nowhere . 
  not really . 
  before euro , prices in netherlands were exact to the cent but at the cash register you were charged in multiples of stuivers ( 5ct ) . 
  rutger hauer is dutch . 
  yep , and once the treaty is open for democratic scrutiny it will be too late to change anything of it , let alone turn it down . 
  infrastructure is cheaper for air travel along most of the distance travelled . 
  i meant the bit that sounds like an albanian doctor named mengele . 
  i do n't understand everything but the thing on bottom right of `` 2 '' looks like a piece of gruesome propaganda to me . 
  but you do remember that a song from wizard of oz topped the british charts the week she passed away ? 
  invention of the printing press . 
  maybe timothy snyder is `` no-one '' for you , but the page has 40 occurrences of `` russia '' and 21 mentionings of `` putin '' . 
  i would be very surprised if the ard would refrain from airing the tournament . 
  fun fact : do you know there was a statisticis/epidemiology program package named sudaan ? 
  yes , you would not often see a family do this in broad daylight . 
  prussia 's rivalry with austria , along with other conflicts , started the seven years ' war , which was fought on five continents and is consequently coined the first world war sometimes . 
   create more floodbasins . 
  this may not help against spring tides , only for overrun rivers . 
  alexis ( ducks ), 
  just ask batavus droogstoppel . 
  so it 's also `` goose step '' in russian ? 
  at least the baltic states are slowly turning towards freedom . 
  all three have a quite thin rail network , at least the netherlands have a high frequency schedule . 
   yeah , just like there 's a correlation between cars and car-related deaths . 
  it is a public health strategy to lower the number of cars in inner cities for precisely that reason . 
  that leaves the question of unintended harm caused by guns . 
  does it correlate with gun ownership in similar ecological studies ? 
  in the eu . 
  europe-wide it would be russian . 
  ten years ago i had been anticipating , and looking forward to , national governments handing responsibilities up to europe and down to regional states , i do n't see the latter happen here in germany . 
  incidentally , tonight i 'll be visiting a reunion of a group of erasmus students who took a course abroad 1989/90 . 
  studying abroad is one of the lasting impressions in life , and this reunion testifies to this . 
  do try it out if you have the chance , and may the powers that be continue to offer the chance . 
  did n't see it , now it 's gone . 
  nice to see that they give us the temperature in \u00b0 c along with \u00b0 f and altitude in m to pay tribute to these peculiar system they are using in the country so easily mistaken for australia . 
  now if they could give the outside pressure in something like mbar , kpa or some other freak units , the whole thing would be even more intellegible to me . 
  how is the gamma in the greek word for `` chancellor '' pronounced ? 
  looks odd to me . 
   what did the abundant moderate muslims did about this or other matters ? 
  did they publicly condemn or march against bigotry or intolerance among their own religion ? 
  [ of course . 
  so belgium 's motorways are not illuminated any more ? 
  that 's amazing . 
  i know i ca n't read 1300 year old german texts . 
  russian , for example , has two prominently used words for different shades of blue , which i would both name `` blue '' without breaking a sweat . 
  one of the two is the colloquial term for `` gay '' . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.pigor.de/getcmsdata.php?id=398&amp;category=hoeren ) ( sorry i did not find a video of this marvellous song ), 
  she has publicly denounced the notion of intellectual property rights , [ which is obviously not the same as copyright law but nobody seems to care ] ( http://www.stefan-niggemeier.de/blog/ekelhaft/ ) . 
   this article was amended on 20th september 2012 to correct the figure of 1.3 % relating to [ annual ] community growth in the first paragraph . 
  it previously read 13 % . 
  i wonder how innumerate one has to be to let this go unnoticed initially . 
  but the two languages are really close , are n't they , like czech and slovak ? 
  martin schulz is hardly germany . 
  most germans would n't know his name . 
  the article is not about the possible boycott of israeli products . 
  yes , i would be surprised to see hawaiian volcanoes on an ad like this , much as i 'd be surprised to see images of r\u00e9union in this ad . 
  i 'll grant that greenland , madeira and the canary islands are closer to europe and therefore easier mistaken for it . 
  greenland is technically part of the north american continent ( al shelf ) . 
   medieval villages usually did normally that would make them towns ; fortifications were one defining aspect of a town . 
  when on vacation in frysl\u00e2n this year i saw the sp 's posters which sported only the iconic logo . 
  i ( probably mis ) interpreted it as a variation on the [ frisian water-lily ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_friesland ) and am no surprised to realise the logo is nationwide . 
   he simply removed his anti-muslim as a focal point , instead is now using anti-eu rhetoric in much the same way . 
  sounds like [ thilo sarrazin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thilo_sarrazin ) and the [ two ] ( http://www.randomhouse.de/book/edition.jsp?edi=296641 ) [ books ] ( http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/titel-abrechnung-mit-dem-euro_aid_755283.html ) he wrote . 
  i guess the next one will be about gas prices . 
  and that 's why i would like to read more multi-lingual content here . 
   it 's not rejected . 
  was n't there a spam filter mentioned somewhere up there ? 
  i , for one , would n't mind more russian , french , or dutch content . 
  speak for yourself . 
  in our country , there 's a dearth of common-sensed politicians , i 'd rather not have them weeded for language skills . 
   if a dodgy part of ukraine proclaimed itself independent through a mini military coup , would we want it to be automatically in the eu ? 
  as ukraine is not an eu member , i do n't see why we should . 
   greece is among the eu countries with the highest fluency in english ireland ?
