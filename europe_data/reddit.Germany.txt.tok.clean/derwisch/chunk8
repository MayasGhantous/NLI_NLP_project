  norway ? 
  united kingdom ? 
  i thought the pronounciation of ` meisje ' is close . 
  her * spiritus rector * has received [ some comments ] ( http://www.titanic-magazin.de/uploads/pics/card_1160105430.jpg ) about his appearance during his long reign . 
  a former republican presidential candidate would sympathise with restricting google suggest , as would the former first lady of germany . 
  [ the aticapitalist wing of the nsdap came to a brutal end in 1934 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gregor_strasser ) you need money to start a war , therefore hitler had to befriend those that had . 
  lets hope his career goes the way of [ ronald barnabas schill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ronald_schill ) . 
  on a pdf document i am watching on screen ? 
  what does the fsc logo signify here ? 
  the misery index is the combined apples rate and oranges rate . 
  adding unemployment rate and inflation rate is creative indeed , more so as only one of the two can not be higher than 100 . 
  the british prefer his performance in `` never say never again '' ? 
  i did n't even know . 
  have n't watched this for ages . 
  that 's a crying shame . 
  was n't reagan of irish descendance and visited the town of his forefathers ? 
  you may want to consider the first-past-the-post majority voting system over there . 
  election results and representation in parliament are only in very rough agreement . 
  granted , but other modes of public transport had been privatised by 1990 , including competing companies serving the same line . 
  what did it for me was that bus schedules were not allowed to have direct connections to busy trains as this would constitute an unfair edge over competitors . 
  around here in old europe , he is more remembered for his foreign-policy antics . 
  it took some very level-headed ( andropov , gorbachev ) or too senile to notice adversaries for the cold war not getting hot . 
  and that 's prior to the collective delusion that followed the wtc strikes . 
  obviously , saving . doc was not what ude had in mind when touting open standards . 
  braindead minimum of total votes to count is braindead . 
  given that it encourages opponents of the motion to abstain rather than to vote with no , the actual rate of eurozone rescue fund supporters should be even higher than 55 per cent . 
  at first i thought : this is about britain , not england . 
  then i remembered that the representatives from wales and scotland were not exactly pleased with cameron either . 
   bosnia is a slavic nation , aintitso ? 
   please read and see how beautiful can czech language be . 
  the sentence [ `` str\u010d prst skrz krk '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/str%c4%8d_prst_skrz_krk ) was used in nazi times to challenge that assumption . 
   a lot of german words in czech are a negative alternative to the czech word . 
  i just yesterday realised that we german have a bit of that habit too , only with french . 
  not to the extent that separatist movements would gain momentum in elections like in your country , but there is a lot of regional identity . 
  some states are conglomerates of previous duchies or prussian provinces , and even within these states the borders come to show sometimes . 
   and * sans bulgaria * , we all used to be part of one country . 
  the ottoman empire would like to have a word with you . 
  you mean estonian fairy tales are scarier than grimm 's m\u00e4rchen ? 
  and you know what happened to snow whites step mother or aschenputtel 's sisters ? 
  whoa . 
  no doubt about folk music though . 
  i can not name a single german folk musician i have a crush for while i only know [ one estonian group ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tiqqz9dagm ) whose cd i purchased on the spot after hearing them the first time . 
   before all that before all that ? 
  how about shostakovich , ustvol ` skaya , gubaidulina ? 
  german here , mostly sharing kinship with the neighbours of my latitude : dutch , belgian , polish , czech , slovak . 
  also , a movie like * bienvenue chez les ch ` tis * makes me realise how alike countries are , with vast cultural differences within the same country ( west germans transferred to the east in the 1990s could relate ) and parallels to neighbouring countries ( flemish tradition of belfries and frikandel ) . 
  that 's one of the notorious false friends between german and dutch . 
  both words have the same root , which should have a meaning like `` solid '' , which acquired the meaning of `` posh '' in dutch and `` down-to-earth '' in german . 
  does this word exist in frisian too ? 
  crappy infographic is crappy . 
  by choice of colours , countries with shrinking debt-to-gdp ratio look most alarming . 
   i do n't recall reading anything that adams wrote and feeling he was being racist or ` harping on about cultural stereotypes ' . 
  i thought you had clicked the links i offered before you responded . 
  never mind . 
   irish are stupid . 
  scottish are drunks . 
  dutch are junkies . 
  french smell . 
  germans are still nazis . 
  belgians are boring . 
  ` belgians are boring ' is , to me , on a different level than ` belgians are into child porn ' . 
  agreed that stereotypes of that sort can get in the way of conflict resolution when shit is approaching fan . 
  the discussion on the euro 's future would have been more advanced if it were n't for some stereotypes regarding mediterranean lifestyle . 
  i would n't even call it racism as you 'd be hard pressed to identify a british as opposed to a french , let alone belgian , race . 
  harping on cultural stereotypes , as one might call it , is a completely different kettle of fish when directed at a neighbouring , politically more or less aligned country , than at the brown people in the same country , as this comes always with an explicit or implicit `` why do n't they just integrate '' . 
  douglas adams is just not on the same level as geert wilders . 
  there is definitely an [ anti-belgian ] ( http://crookedtimber.org/2005/06/19/belgium-man-belgium/#comment-75503 ) [ sentiment ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=life,_the_universe_and_everything&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3 ) with the british , but it seems to me it 's on a tongue-in-cheek base . 
  in the nineties belgium became associated with child porn , at least among germans . 
  i remember a series where one character brushed off a child porn possession allusion with `` do i look belgian ? '', 
  if racism is being exerted against people other than the underpriviledged minorities in your own country , it becomes a lot more bearable . 
   you hear it all over europe : from frenchmen , from dutchmen , from danes , poles , czechs , serbs , greeks -- even , occasionally , from britons . 
  talk about understatement . 
  [ nicholas ridley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicholas_ridley,_baron_ridley_of_liddesdale ) , anyone ? 
   really ? 
  i guess i was too young to properly remember . 
  yes , definitely , i remember the talklines of `` germany should be the economic locomotive of europe ; as a matter of fact they are the couchette . '', 
  what 's the difference between `` free '' and `` independent '' ? 
  why is tripoli coloured as if it was a german colony ? 
  l\u00fcbeck was n't part of the `` ungedeelt '' duchies and , unless i am mistaken , did not participate in the german-danish war . 
   but the problem is rather that ultra-right ideology has a solid foothold in parts of germany , mainly in the former east . 
  during the 1970s the raf terrorists murdered while claiming an ideology that was shared by a lot of people back then . 
  and except for selecting low-profile targets . 
  the raf managed to really unsettle the elite in germany because they were directly on their hit list . 
  there was a fair amount of political assassinations in the weimar republic , famously reported by the statistician [ emil julius gumbel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emil_julius_gumbel ) : in the first two years after end of wwi there were 314 murders by the political right , amounting to a total of 31 years 3 months of prison for the murderers , plus one life-long detainment . 
  the political left , in contrast , committed 13 murders and the murderers duly received 8 death penalties and a total of 176 years imprisonment . 
  political assassinations are not equivalent with terrorism but it 's safe to say that some of the crimes were committed with the aim of intimidating the political opponent . 
  it took only one day after the fall of the berlin wall until the bulgarian leader was toppled , for instance . 
  npd should be in there when bnp is listed . 
  [ titanic ( in german ) ] ( http://www.titanic-magazin.de/rss.4554 ) was a bit more explicit about it . 
  not much left to eat if you use a shotgun . 
  this should read 120 per cent . 
  bad enough . 
   the eu is more liberal than the right wing in our country ; therefore right wing voters do n't like eu ideals and institutions ; such as maximum working week hours , human rights act ( ! ), 
  centrist and left wingers do like these things . 
  is that sentiment in the eu going to change now that conservatives are in the majority in the parliament ? 
  the west/north border of bohemia was among the most stable on the whole continent . 
  [ guardia di finanza ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guardia_di_finanza ) : til . 
  i 'd put more faith into the [ e-cell ] ( http://www.e-cell.org/ecell/ ) project to complete . 
  simulating the metabolism in a single cell is hard enough .
