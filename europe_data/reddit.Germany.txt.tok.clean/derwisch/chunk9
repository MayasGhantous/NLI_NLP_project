  which scandinavian tourists do you see in latvia most often ? 
  learn their language , and talk english to all the others ( or encourage the odd norwegian to join the swedish group ) . 
  extra-sensory money . 
  add to this that the only party with substantial opposition to bailing out greece took a severe blow in the most recent regional elections . 
  on the other hand , germany 's * non * - respectable ( and therefore most read ) news outlet is in favour of dropping greece from the euro zone . 
  that love goes into the ellipsis . 
  then again , this is typical food which can be ruined by some country pub . 
  west berlin was a different kind of sexy back then . 
  it was a safe haven for young male west germans who wanted to avoid getting drafted . 
  you could feel confined ( day trips to the countryside were doable , but rarely entertained ) and free ( because of a more liberal lifestyle ) at the same time . 
  it was quite but not particularly cheap back then , despite an 8 per cent negative income tax for west berlin employees . 
  no , that 's really a stereotype the british earnt themselves through decades of serving mushy peas and greasy haddock with chips in country pubs . 
  but even 25 years ago , every tourist to uk would come back and go `` british food is disgusting , * except * pastries , scones , their breakfast ( if you avoid the sausages ) , cheese and crackers ... '' sounding a bit like reg in life of brian . 
  the more radical alignment of ep parties than of national parliament parties -- do you think it has something to do with the rather marginal role parliament plays in the eu government ( again , as opposed to the national governments ) ? 
  do you think this is a chicken-and-egg problem ? 
  after the outcome of the last ep elections i became uncertain if it 's a bad thing the parliament has that little influence . 
  i 'd gather they vote green . 
  the greens seemed to have an image problem as being too tightly associated with gentrification and southern germans , which are generally more violently hated in berlin than islamic arabs . 
  when i was a child and we went on holiday to belgium , my father would point out that unlike in germany , belgian car license plate revealed no information about the region the car was registered , as otherwise cars from the other part of the country would be singled out by policemen for overfined tickets . 
   it 's only in the last century * or two * ( i believe ? ), 
  that the situation reversed . 
  given that belgium is younger than 200 years , rather the last century . 
  the coalfields in wallonie used to make more money than the flandrish ports until less than a century ago . 
   green-cabbage kings he talks about events that focus on [ kale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kale ) , something like the crowning of [ wine queens ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%bcdesheim_am_rhein#tradition ) . 
  this phrase would be barely comprehensible in german to people unaware of northwestern traditions . 
   also the west pays a tax to the east so who cares . 
  so does the east . 
  when i worked in east germany in the 1990s my colleagues assumed that i get western wage while my western friends assumed that i would n't have to pay solidarit\u00e4tszuschlag . 
  to cope with today 's worldwide carbon emissions , sequestered co2 would accumulate as rapidly as water falls down niagara falls . 
  makes me feel uneasy too . 
  how high would the pressure have to be compared to just storing wood blocks or logs deep underground and prevent it from rotting ? 
  the adolphe sax museum of musical instruments in brussels is nice . 
  [ this device ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=datei:wagenschl%c3%bcssel.jpg ) may be helpful ( eg to lock your compartment ) but its usage is not appreciated by train personnel . 
  540 \u00b0 turn ? 
   people constantly confuse us with slovakia you ca n't really blame us here due to the resolution of the flag icon . 
  but you got me when you mentioned the foreign language aspect , which in slovakia would be czech or hungarian more often than not . 
  you forgot concrete-slabbed cycle lanes . 
  do they still exist ? 
  i got that :-), 
  the hard thing is to get the proper english spelling if you are not english yourself . 
  i dispaired on the asia map when trying to enter kyrgystan or something . 
  gp is a guy who comes from a place where 0.05 $ still buy you a goat . 
  these kind of people attract the only nazis in town like you attract the only vegan on a party . 
  [ ahem ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/hqajb/frances_record_drought_is_threatening_electricity/ ), 
  loriot is the embodiment of a stiff upperlip approach so i always figured he might strike a chord among the english . 
  nuclear power is prone to terrorist attacks on several levels . 
  this opens opportunities for government to engage in security theater and expand . 
  solar , wind , and heating-power cells can be operated by smaller enterprises . 
  so traditionally , the big government parties , like the waning soviet-style left , are in favour of nukes , while those wary of a police state and more in favour of individual entrepreneurship have an argument against . 
  it 's only one argument which has to be weighed against all other pros and cons , but it 's enough not to pretend political affililation does n't have anything to do with it . 
  coal plants are being [ built ] ( http://www.kraftwerk-datteln.com/pages/ekw_de/index.htm ) or [ expanded ] ( http://www.gkm.de/projekt_block_9/ ) . 
  it has repeatedly been shown that speed limits reduce accidents . 
  i have n't information on the effect of enforcement , but i 'd suspect that enforced speed limits are more effective . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://www2.securiteroutiere.gouv.fr/ressources/bilan/2009/sources/index.htm ) ( p. 16 ) is a source which highlights the development of road deaths in france in the course of speed limit enforcement . 
  * feeling smug about how los angelinos speak of frankfurt as being `` neat as a pin '' *, 
   the eu is more on dependent on freight rail and the us trucking . 
  without having checked , i am not so sure about that . 
  but i think that 11 ) precisely b/c of the steep tax the price is not that much affected by the market here . 
  germany borders on poland so skilled workers would be able to work in germany over the week and still be with their families on the weekend , or even each night . 
   if you ask pirates about their goals for the next election , `` more votes than the fdp '' has largely replaced other goals such as `` finally enough votes to overcome the five-percent minimum '' . 
  sounds they are becoming more modest . 
  as i have heard , many young german-speaking and french-speaking swiss communicate in english , though their partner 's native language is usually the first they learn in school . 
  you have to give them some credit as the german spoken by swiss is somewhat unlike the german taught to french-speaking swiss . 
  when on vakantie in holland i had grolsch malzbier which was outstandingly non-sweet for its kind . 
  nice demonstration how a small sample size begets extreme results . 
  the marshall islands are the safest nation and the cook islands the most dangerous . 
  [ not ] ( http://www.koenig.de ) [ every ] ( http://www.brinkhoffs.de/ ) [ beer ] ( http://www.harte-arbeit-ehrlicher-lohn.de/ ) [ from ] ( http://www.stauder.de/ ) [ the ] ( http://www.moritz-fiege.de/ ) [ ruhr ] ( http://www.hoevels-hausbrauerei.de/ ) [ is ] ( http://www.stifts.de/marken/301_u1125.html ) [ altbier ] ( http://www.dab.de/ ) . 
  tfa does n't state he is `` far-right '' , only that the far right welcomes his statements . 
  this is as close to a [ factual statement ] ( http://www.taz.de/1/leben/alltag/artikel/1/wahlkampfhilfe-fuer-rechtsextreme/ ) as possible . 
   once they started spielkreis around 3 , they became fluent in german . 
  this . 
  research on language acquisition shows that children are best at picking up both languages if their parents speak their native language exclusively at home and their peers in kindergarten exclusively speak the local language . 
  of course this sounds easier than it is given that german cities are quite segregated by cultural backgrounds , which means you can expect different kindergartens to have different language domains . 
  chicken wings ? 
  steaks from the bbq . 
  from what i recall , beef is generally more tasty in north america than in europe . 
  are you norwegian ? 
  you may ( hard to say given your range ) also like kalabra ( swedish folk ) . 
  deishovida ( austrian , instrumental folk ) have regrettably split last year . 
  figli di madre ignota if you are into balkan ska from milano . 
  plus it 's less than clear that the german regions feel like joining germany or france . 
  terms like `` midnight hour '' are too deeply ingrained in cluture . 
  i do n't see any change happening . 
  the next european football championship on either side of the outer eu border will be a challenge for security forces . 
  ok i was wrong about the 1970 's my bad . 
  but 1981/02/23 was not what i 'd call waaay before 1986 . 
  plus it 's about perspective . 
  by the way , i remember the spanish people 's reaction to the attempted coup d'etat , which was nearly as heartening as what we 're witnessing in north africa right now . 
  i do n't dispute that ( who am i to dispute numbers , let alone wolfram alpha ) and eu would n't look the same afterwards . 
  but romania , for instance , got an associated state of the eu when their gdp/capita was at $ 1560 ( thanks w\u03b1 ) , so i 'd say this line has been crossed quite some time ago . 
  me ( german ) , i am taking a stab at french now because i have moved to a place where the closest border is to a francophone country . 
  before that i lived closer to the netherlands so i picked up some dutch . 
  as a teenager i learnt russian mainly b/c i played chess back then . 
  i agree on the english/romance/slavic approach , this makes it easier to get some bits of a language before vacationing . 
  most people from the host country appreciate if yu are bungling around their linguistic territory . 
  only one campground manager in prague 1991 rebuffed me for manslaughtering czech instead of directly addressubf her in german . 
  but first of all it should be a matter of personal preference . 
  if you ca n't wrap your head around the language , learn something else . 
  budapest was great . 
  the last time i have felt so left out was in malaysia .
