imagine how they felt when russia invaded georgia in 2008 . :d, 
  also know as serbocroatian in many languages including english . 
  ok , just making sure we 're on the same page . 
  as in , they all are a part of different brands of feminism , some more radical than others ? 
  that 's absolutely right . 
  well that does explain it . 
  i have no doubt that young poles in large cities speak good english , just that throughout the country the proficiency is markedly higher than throughout germany . 
  krakow is a wonderful city by the way . 
  well , i would n't call it major by any means , but it 's definitely a city . 
  it 's the 7th-largest in poland and there 's only one city with more than a million . 
  the two closest german cities in terms of population in germany would be duisburg and bochum , and i 'd definitely say those can speak english better than szczecin . 
  those * are * part of the ruhr area , so they might not count because they 're in the middle of an agglomeration of 11 million . 
  in that case , szczecin is between n\u00fcrnberg and bielefeld , which i 'd still wager speak better english . 
  add that to szczecin being a border town , and i 'd expect more people to be bilingual , as it usually is around borders . 
  i 'd guess , in fact , that the only exception to what i 've observed would be university-aged poles in warsaw . 
  may i ask where in poland you lived ? 
  i 'm actually drawing my experience from cities , especially those close to the border ( szczecin ) . 
  i do n't have much experience with polish towns at all . 
  yeah , really . 
  germany below poland ? 
  i live close to the border with poland and there 's a marked difference in english proficiency as soon as you cross the oder . 
  here 's one source : http://www.saveservices.org/dvlp/policy-briefings/what-is-the-profile-of-domestic-violence-around-the-world/  the largest survey conducted to date probed dating violence among 13,601 university students in 32 countries . 
  severe physical aggression included any of these actions directed against a dating partner : punched , hit , kicked , choked , slammed against a wall , beat up , burned or scalded , or used a knife or gun ( 4 ) :  #overall , 10.8 % of couples had engaged in severe physical aggression in the previous 12 months . 
  among these couples , both persons were violent in 54.8 % of cases , only the female was violent in ** 29.4 % ** of cases , and only the male was aggressive in ** 15.7 % ** of cases . 
   male-initiated severe aggression was more common in the following ** 4 ** countries : greece , portugal , tanzania , and venezuela . 
   female-initiated severe aggression was the more prevalent pattern in the following ** 25 ** countries : australia , belgium , brazil , canada , china , germany , great britain , guatemala , hong kong , hungary , india , israel , lithuania , malta , mexico , netherlands , new zealand , romania , singapore , south africa , switzerland , taiwan , south korea , russia , and the united states here 's another couple : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epidemiology_of_domestic_violence#cite_note-31  31 : a review of the research literature indicates that female intimate partner violence ( ipv ) is a frequent as male ipv . 
  it is just as severe and has much the same consequences for males as for females . 
   32 : a 2007 study of over 2,400 spanish high school students found that girls are substantially more likely than boys to exhibit physical aggression ( 41.9 % vs. 31.7 % ) , including higher rates of hitting/kicking ( 13.4 % vs 5.3 % ) , slapping ( 12.4 % vs 3.1 % ) and shoving/grabbing ( 22.5 % vs 11.9 % ) . 
   33 : a 2000 meta analysis found that men inflict 65 % of domestic injuries , but women are more likely ( d = -.05 ) to use any act of violence or aggression . 
   35 : a study of university students in spain found that `` violent psychological behaviors ( characterized by the presence of verbal aggression and coercive and jealous behaviors ) and physical aggression were significantly higher in women , though the consequences of physical aggression were worse for the women 's health . '', 
  pretty sure the numbers are fairly even in most western countries . 
  on those roads ? 
  you 'll be swallowed by a massive pothole , that 's practically suicide !, 
  well , shit . 
  that 's basically how i speak dutch , by speaking what i know , the rest is all german with the consonant shift reversed and my terrible accent . 
  same ... :(, 
  if you 've never had tegernseer spezial , i highly suggest you try it . 
  it 's pretty hard to find though because the brewery ca n't keep up with the order volume , so i 've had the most success by ordering from a drinks deliverer who puts you on a waitlist . 
  sterni  oettinger !!, 
   k\u00f6nigsberger klopse , kassler , bockwurst , rote gr\u00fctze , fassbrause well fuck me , i must be an ultra-prussian then . 
  i always thought those were just german things , not regional things . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  i think people are misunderstanding me , because i never said anything against that . 
   maybe , i do n't know enough about that in germany , but the uk is definitely not germany . 
  the uk is definitely not germany , i know , but my comments were based on my experiences here . 
  i strongly believe that if a government is going to decide that you do n't work `` enough '' it 's their responsibility to give you the chance to do so , first and foremost . 
   nothing is too hard for people who do not have to do it . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're saying here . 
  it 's not too hard for people to find a job when the government allows them to live on welfare indefinitely ? 
  the categorisation would n't be too hard if it did n't have to happen ? 
   well , i think you 're wrong [ ... ] and that 's why i think that these policies have to be implemented well , which is what i have been saying all along . 
  it is society 's duty to support those of us who ca n't make it . 
  but is it also our duty to support those who can and choose not to , because they know we will support them ? 
  i would not agree with this . 
  instead , it is our responsibility to give tools to make it on their own to those who are n't , regardless of whether it 's a choice or not . 
  if they do n't choose to use those tools , i do n't see a problem with also not supporting them . 
  you see , the philosophy of welfare here , which i think is a great one , is that it 's a trade between society and citizen . 
  society has a duty to support the citizen , and in return the citizen has a duty to offer themselves to the work market or in some way work for the common good of society in whatever ways they can . 
  in the case being discussed here , assuming correct categorisation , which should be perfectly doable , the trade is not being fulfilled . 
  remember , there are six other categories , and we do n't know what all of them are . 
  and , in the end , perhaps you are right that in practise this would never work in the uk . 
  why that would be , i have no idea ; i 'm not an experienced citizen of that nation . 
  i 'm speaking based only on my experiences with welfare in my home country , and what the article puts forth in theory . 
  then it 's the goverment 's responsibility to help them find better-paying work . 
  that 's how it works in germany . 
  they want you out of the system as fast as possible , so they try to find you a job . 
  additionally , i 'm sure that if that job was all they could find , they would n't be categorised as `` not working enough '' . 
  these are both questions about the idea 's method of implementation though , not about the idea . 
  the implementation could use quite a lot of scrutiny , and all i was saying above is that the idea ( obviously with sufficiently good implementation ) is a good one . 
  this is n't actually bad , in my opinion . 
  it only applies to those in receipt of some sort of benefit who make below the minimum wage for 35-hour weeks . 
  i ca n't think of a reason why a person who does n't fall into their other categories ( `` too sick to work '' , `` too committed to work '' , a category including lone parents , ... ) should receive full benefits if they simply choose not to work enough hours to receive minimum wage . 
  reichelt , then kaiser 's , then lidl . 
   so you do n't keep track of email and internet data ? 
   not the way you 're saying . 
  i 'm going to hang up now . 
  combined with that the other service agent kept asking for contact info this is hilarious . 
  peanut cheese *, 
  he said that german supermarkets have products swiss ones do n't , and are usually a bit cheaper . 
  that does n't mean the swiss supermarkets are shitty , just mundane and expensive in the eyes of this swiss poster . 
  makes perfect sense , thanks . 
  the \u044a makes for an interesting transliteration . 
  the ipa equivalent would be / \u0264\u031e / , which does n't correspond to a single latin letter . 
  it does correspond to the sound / \u0259 / , though , might mean that they decided to stick b\u0259 ... at the end of the b * list . 
  i agree that it 's a strange sorting order since it attempts to sort words of multiple different alphabets together , but this is one possible explanation . 
  another would be that they simply transliterated it as u , just like convention is , which also puts bu after be . 
  sure , that 's one way to look at it . 
  either way , there are no options for countries besides germany , which is what makes the map showing the responses for that question so funny . 
  because according to eu law , it 's illegal to hate gay people . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry . 
   what 's \\ ^ with \\ ^ the \\ ^ uppedies ? 
  get res , it lets you view the source for comments . 
  yes , it was , so those who answered it that way would not be counted at all , since that is not a country . 
  personally , i had to laugh when i saw that question . 
  yeah , seems to be sorting alphabetically . 
  fair enough . 
  i wondered if there was a reason behind it , or there was a reason you chose those two cities specifically . 
  i 'm biased because i come from berlin , but you have made quite a hard question . 
  both are beautiful cities . 
  may i ask why you want our opinions on this ?
