  of course they are n't people . 
  people do n't get these rights through ttip . 
  minefields between essex and sussex are always an option for the romance of travel . 
  these are mock trial by any standards of a liberal democracy and constitutional state . 
  that is the question and not if the dictator is benevolent to those he was put in charge for ( surprise ! ) . 
  when the federal republic of germany `` encourages '' ( huh ! ), 
  me to buy something and later outlaws it i do n't get to sue them before a secret extra-legal court in which half of the judges are appointed by me . 
  -_- it was an attempt at a humorous remark trying to point out the very limited usefulness of statistics based on quantities not being defined . 
   the cause of countless death without preventing a single terrorist incident . 
  `` war against terror '' in a nutshell . 
  80 percent prevalence of sexual harassment means everybody is constantly being sexually harassed for 24 * 8/10 = 19.2 hours per day . 
  it 's ok . we know it was n't your fault . 
  nice to hear that germany is on an unstoppable way to world domination as proven by the iron laws of economy . 
  alas , the same yellow economy press , economist et al , who claims that were already planning the funeral for the german economy only 10 , 15 years ago . 
  did anybody think of the carbon footprint ? 
  that 's too harsh . 
  you take that back !, 
  we have a sense of humor we just prefer not to use it . 
  i expected this , but with more vodka . 
  i just looked it up and can confirm : dear and teuer are cognates . 
  til !, 
  do n't editorialize ... oh wait this is the title . 
  reuters can see the future and a pretty improbable one at that . 
  does that mean in slovenia there is no such thing as a government or no such thing as quality ? 
  thanks god it 's not his [ right arm ] ( https://cynicritics.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/drstrangelove02.jpg ) . 
  but apparently a common one , and better than any i could come up with . 
  `` the voice of the internet '' = / = individual europeans social media + pseudonymousity acts as a filter that any wise or at least smart thought struggles to pass . 
  come again ? 
  spiegel did exactly the opposite . 
  what b\u00f6hmermann says is '' [ irony ] our video is real [ / irony ] '' and spiegel concludes it 's not . 
  i 'm sure there never was a varoufakis in the first place . 
  `` varoufakis '' = varou-fake-is , get it ? 
  / s indeed , i do n't believe greece really exists . 
  the whole money went to area 51 . 
  we should go full autism and reshape europe into a square with 5x5 provinces . 
  i guess i 'm too neurotypical to see the benefits of this . 
  why not uefa ? 
  yes . 
  we ( as individuals ) all deal with other countries in one way of the other , and other countries deal with us . 
  this happens according to rules . 
  the question are how these rules are made and by whom . 
  everything else follows from that , in my humble opinion . 
  [ grub first , then ethics .

  if you ca n't remember you say you ca n't remember and not `` the video is clearly faked '' if you 're a ) honest ( or at least not stupid ) and b ) not a loony conspiracy theorist . 
  do n't mind that i 'm lefthanded now and 2 cm taller . 
  seriously : see : he is n't dead and/or toppled . 
  it was just the flu . 
  or the back . 
  or a cancer treatment . 
  but it was fun while it lasted ... 
  in general , i agree with that i just do n't think bloomberg would put `` putin '' into a report on their own volition in this situation . 
  in this case , i guess , it is exactly what the agency wrote . 
  and some intern at bloomberg then made an article out of it without thinking about it too hard . 
  die zeit writes exactly the same btw . 
  but what if jews , obama and unknown authorities killed putin ? 
  there wo n't be a monday until putin returns . 
  one of putin 's girlfriends is not pregnant . 
  he just returned from a visit to his home planet . 
  because the information that an austrian tabloid claims to know a mysterious , unnamed doctor claiming to treat putin 's ~ ~ butthurt ~ ~ back problems is worth shit ? 
  that 's said , it 's actually a * realistically sounding * made up explanation for once . 
  blick is n't exactly a trustworthy news source . 
  they cloned stalin 's brain and implanted it into his head ? 
  things to be executed for [ _ ] running a stone age genocidal totalitarian terror regime [ x ] betraying your leaders you know what ? 
  is agrees . 
  you 're correct , be careful what you wish for . 
  however i think it 's highly unlikely that he 's `` gone '' ( though it 's even more unlikely that this would happen through peaceful means ) . 
  my guess is he 's in hospital , for nothing too serious . 
  but they ca n't admit it because being ill is a sign of weakness , therefore gay , therefore illegal in russia . 
  putin does n't have an alibi . 
  just saying ... 
  and both are shorter than napoleon . 
  i turned all my stocks into gold and a bunker below my garden . 
  do you know how hard this is on a weekend ? 
  putin better launches all his nukes now or i 'll be pissed . 
  iirc it was invented on krautchan . 
  sometimes they switched the eu members ' country flags for the eu flags . 
  leading to everybody pretending they 're from another country , often provoked by threads starting `` name your country and do you ... '' . 
  the answers were then typically `` sweden yes '' if '' ... '' is anything relating to homosexuality . 
  i blame putin . 
  i just do . 
  but you would n't guess that looking at their legal standing worldwide . 
  we could put her behind the wheel in saudi arabia and see what happens . 
  she 's also a so-called `` woman '' . 
  to bring some humor into the world ? 
  i 'm speculating now but despite the name , i do n't even think that their stance against islam is at the heart of the movement . 
  it 's a general uneasiness with the modern world . 
  but yes , the majority sees islam as a threat and muslims as some faceless collective that has conspired to subvert german culture into something different that fits their interests . 
  i do n't think there are many potential lone wolf terrorists among the pediga marchers , they want an properly organized state `` to take care of that problem '' . 
  they do n't have genocidal ideas and probably did n't put any thought into that at all . 
  however if they attempted to put a regime into place that fits their ideas how a `` true democracy '' is supposed to look like , they 'll probably end up with something else entirely and the destruction of any safeguards against a genocide . 
  as history shows . 
  they see themselves as democrats , i suppose . 
  they just have a pre-modern , anti-western , romantic and naive understanding of democracy that there is an objective and obvious `` will '' of the `` people '' somewhere ( as opposed to an infinity of competing interests of individuals ) which the state merely has to execute against any opposition ( as opposed to manage these interests , adhere to the rule of law and respect individual rights ) . 
  this will of the people is of course their own , they themselves as representatives of the broad majority . 
  this is pretty much the fundamental assumption of their movement and expresses itself in their central slogan ( `` wir sind das volk '' ) . 
  the state failing to execute their demands is thus seen as a sign that the government is not truly democratic but instead betraying the will of the people ( `` volksver\u00e4ter '' ) . 
  media painting a different picture is `` lying '' ( `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' ) being part of the conspiracy . 
  any real opposition inside the population ( which is small anyway , see above ) are traitors and enemies to democracy . 
  tl ; dr they do n't see themselves as nazis but true democrats .
