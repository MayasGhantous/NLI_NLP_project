  i wonder how many people here actually get what these maps are supposed to mean . 
  they are n't meant to display the facts . 
  they 're not the result of a scientific study of prevalent stereotypes either . 
  they 're supposed to teach what a stereotype * is * . 
  that 's why they 're painted with the broadest brush imaginable and at best full of inaccuracies . 
  the effect would n't be even close if the artist had respected national boundaries because people are used to carve their stereotypes along them . 
  the north-west of europe is protestant , ireland is in the north-west , so ireland is protestant . 
  if you think this is bs then you 've just understood what a prejudice is . 
  today i learned : the principle of presumption of innocence is unknown to us pesky continentals . 
  i guess `` in dubio pro reo '' must be old saxon then ? 
  calling it now : epp becomes largest group , juncker replaces rompuy , epp pulls a different commission president out of their hats . 
  edit : the map on that page is useless at best , misleading at worst . 
  this is not a us presidental election . 
  see also https://www.myvote2014.eu for comparison, 
  alternative names currently under discussion are freedom cheese , liberty cheese and cheesus . 
  this is not some jingoistic flag waving contest . 
  i 'm neither a european nor an american company but a voter and tax payer , and this is where my legitimate interests lie : my vote having an effect and my money not financing ceos whatever passport they may hold . 
  new york times claiming the treaty would `` give '' corporations the right to sue governments implies they do n't have this right now . 
  truth is : they have . 
  just not before a travesty of a court deciding in secret . 
  i 'm all for a proper international court judging in a transparent way on the basis of laws established in a legitimate way . 
  in fact , we have something like this already , it 's called the ecj . 
  can you vocaroo me that ? 
   they have been particularly incensed by a proposal for the insertion of a legal proposal for the insertion of a legal provision known as investor-state dispute settlement , which would give corporations the right to sue governments within the european union for damages if an agreement was `` breached '' and it caused economic harm . 
  so i open the nyt and read this . 
  and what do i learn ? 
  `` in communist yurop you ca n't sue the government ! '', 
  brb making strawpoll about somebody seceding from somebody . 
  the economist considers itself a `` liberal '' newspaper . 
  remember when `` liberalism '' meant fighting for civil rights ? 
  if europe started this crisis , it probably started it [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_the_rights_of_man_and_of_the_citizen ) . 
  yougov stands very close to the tory party , to put it mildly . 
  i do n't believe these alleged poll results are worth anything and neither are the conclusions this article draws from it . 
  the political intentions of the author are obvious . 
  basically , it 's journalism as bad as it can get . 
  yes , i should have explained what i mean instead of just giving a hurr-durr reaction . 
  yeaaaaah , ok . another day , another poll . 
  wait until sofia becomes the next big thing for the hipster community , if it has n't already . 
  good idea . 
  so , non-cynical answer : i do n't consider the eu unappealing , so i 'm not the right person to ask . 
  i perceive a growing alienation of the people from the democratic process , with eu phobia being only one facet of it , it worries me , and i 'd wish do n't know how to fix it . 
  it 's certainly not simply `` the politicians fault '' . 
  sorry for being cynical , but * executing the will of the people , meaning : my own * disregarding lobby and other selfish interests and sinister forces , meaning : other people * taking responsibility for everything that goes wrong in the process that 's at least the impression i get from online news commentaries . 
  works for eu as well as for national institutions . 
  `` russia itself '' meaning `` putin '' i guess ? 
  i feel tempted to formulate a witty comment containing the words [ penis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:david_von_michelangelo.jpg ) and [ guns ] ( http://www.ilpost.it/2014/03/08/david-armato-pubblicita/david_ar50a1_72/ ) and america , but it 's late and it 's not that you have n't read a thousand sentences along that lines already . 
  because of the notable absence of russian troops in edinburgh during the referendum . 
  [ so green ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz1pukkd3m1r5zttro1_400.gif ), 
  ukip is hypocritical in their talk but at least consequent in their goal : out . 
  cameron on the other hand ... 
  if the eu was a car it had 28 brakes , that 's the problem . 
  where do they grow these merkel fanboys ? 
  and you 're not looking for an answer . 
  otherwise you would address your question at somebody who can answer it . 
  remember , according to russian government propaganda , what happened in the ukraine was a far-right uprising against the russophone population . 
  so what was he supposed to tell his believers ? 
  `` the crimean population , while being persecuted by a fascist mob that took over government in kiev , is now holding a proper , recognized referendum in a civilized way whether or not to secede from ukraine , a referendum supported by the evil capitalist masterminds in the west . '', 
  disregarding what you think about ttip in general , note :  according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , ( ... ) german officials are disappointed by the tariff reductions proposed by the us side . 
  ( my own , hopefully somewhat better-than-google translation . ), 
  just as a reminder for those who 'd like to swap their eu membership against a free trade agreement : a `` free trade agreement '' is n't the same as an internal market , if fact it 's not even an agreement about * free trade * . 
  greetings redditors , i 'm a time traveler from the 1980s . 
  now , how 's life like under japanese global domination ? 
  what on earth has that to do with `` holding hostages '' please ? 
  first rule for wannabe hostage-takes : do not send your hostages away . 
   seriously , i 'm the last person who speaks out for punishing people for acts they did n't commit . 
  but the people op has in mind are n't here despite their family but * because * their family is able to afford the tuition fees . 
  and their university education is a privilege , not a right . 
  ordinary russians without financial backup who overstay would be extradited without a second thought . 
  sending down an university student does n't exactly amount to a war crime . 
  the current regime in russia is not totalitarian . 
  just to point that out . 
  well , ok , i guess . 
  question : `` what if things stabilize in the conflict in the ukraine and the proxy conflict between the eu , us , nato and russia ? '', 
  answer `` the media is biased . 
  wars do n't solve problems . '', 
  huh ? 
  maybe you should just have chosen another title for whatever your point is . 
  i read the title and i thought i understood the question - then i read the text below and ... what ? 
  relevant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_d_vmkswe, 
  goddamn ignorant fat merican redneck hillbill ... oh wait !, 
  there is nothing to negotiate and merkel knows that very well . 
  must be the covenant between karl marx and josef stalin then . 
  how broad is ukraine ? 
  you 're getting that backwards , i fear . 
  croatia has a persecuted russian minority now . 
  russians troops are already underway to protect them from the fascist government . 
  it is n't `` so interested '' that 's mostly tory spin . 
  the natives of europe do not eagerly wait for the british empire to bring them civilization . 
  what is this `` 33 percent blocking minority '' he 's talking about ? 
  generally , the ep decides by majority 50 % + 1 . 
  does he have any concrete clause in the treaties in mind or is he 's talking out of his behind ? 
  of course , that farage can not dictate decisions just because people do n't vote for him again shows how evil the eu is . 
  a country is n't sovereign anymore the second it enters a trade agreement . 
  and a common market is even much more than a mere trade agreement . 
  for contrast and comparison , [ this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/treffen-mit-der-queen-kanzlerin-merkel-reist-nach-london-a-955376.html ) is the spiegel 's take on this . 
  since [ translation results ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fausland%2ftreffen-mit-der-queen-kanzlerin-merkel-reist-nach-london-a-955376.html ) german -  english are probably awkward , here my attempt on the key points * the tories overestimate merkel 's influence * the german government ( 's speaker ) judges their expectations as too high * german reform ideas point into a more integrationist direction , if anything * merkel is in no hurry for reform , anyway * she will make vague promises in that direction which is easy since cameron has n't come around with anything substantial yet * germany wo n't agree to restrictions on free movement , weakening labor laws , or weakening justice cooperation, 
  he has been buried alive ? 
  i do n't think potential swiss erasmus students of all people were the group that voted in favor of this motion . 
  it 's not the us republicans ' goal to dissolve the united states . 
  but whatever the european parliament `` has to accomplish '' , the europhobes will be happy if it wo n't .
