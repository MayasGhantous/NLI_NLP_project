cia is playing the world like it 's a fifty cent pinball machine . 
  one of my favorite bits of that is still volker pisper 's show about [ us foreign politics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg0ql0vfcrg ) ( there 's also a [ russian translation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw_f7wi7zly ) somebody seems to have done ) . 
  not admitting that the cia/us is just as much a threat to sovereign countries and their democratically elected leaders is just being deliberate ignorance in the face of history . 
  so poland and lithuania , back together at last . 
  good to hear they worked it out , even if it 's become a threesome with the uk involved . 
  damn austrians ca n't stick to their side of the border :p, 
  yup , anecdotally i can say that it 's not a bad thing at all . 
  if people move here to go to university , they are already contributing to our economy by living here and buying local goods . 
  and a fair number of them even stay , either for work or to continue their studies as a phd student . 
  the only thing that i think is still potentially a bit lacking is more support in helping them learn german . 
  a lot of courses in the most faculties are still only taught in german , so a fairly decent command of it is required very early on . 
  additionally it 's really isolating here in germany if you ca n't speak any german , at least outside of university culture . 
  we do n't and honestly , saying they are ` common ' unless you live essentially next to a military base or something might be an overstatement on the part of the article . 
  i 've not seen a tank drive on any roads around where i live at least . 
  no worries . 
  you just need to be bigger than florida for size comparisons of dick-shapes across continents . 
  '' ... um die russen zu verwirren '' ( to confuse the russians ) is an idiom among german engineers for a reason . 
  balearics/mallorca as the 17th bundesland , and we 'll bail you out . 
  it 's fine , they also sell the 2nd rate products as flightless earthbound medium altitude long endurance drones . 
  kind of . 
  \u00dcberfall is a a robbery . 
  \u00dcberfallen is the act of committing one . 
  in the context of war , it generally refers to wars which are started by some aggressive/overt act that comes more-or-less unexpected and not just diplomatically , for instance japan attacking pearl harbor , not something like [ the uk declaring war on japan subsequently ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_declaration_of_war_on_japan ) or somilar things . 
  well there was cooperation before that , e.g. 
  the latin monetary union from 1865 , but that also does n't really translate into the creation of the eu . 
  every now and then i guess . 
  we do n't really vote for the chancellor directly , but for the party , which put up a chancellor candidate ( so it is well known in advance who they want ) , so popularity of a person is not usually polled for . 
  polling results for which party is popular are done very regularly , if not weekly by various outlets . 
  [ this website ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/ ) for example lists various polling results along the lines of `` if you had to vote next sunday , which party would you vote for ? '', 
  ( merkel is part of cdu/csu ) . 
  actually the wikipedia article ( [ disarmed enemy forces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disarmed_enemy_forces ) ) provides a source that says the contrary :  the icrc made approaches to the authorities of the four occupation zones and , in the autumn of 1945 , it received authorization to send both relief and delegates into the french and british zones . 
  on 4 february 1946 , the icrc was allowed to send relief into the american zone , and on 13 april 1946 it obtained permission to extend this activity to the soviet zone . 
  source : [ international committee of the red cross ] ( https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnwx.htm ) wikipedia says the reason for the designation was that they were having difficulties supplying food at the level the geneva convention would have demanded :  because of the logistical impossibility of feeding millions of surrendered german soldiers at the levels required by the geneva convention during the food crisis of 1945 , the purpose of the designation -- along with the british designation of surrendered enemy personnel ( sep ) -- was to prevent categorization of the prisoners as prisoners of war ( pow ) under the 1929 geneva convention . 
  while unsourced , if that 's the case it would n't have made sense for them to deny external ( red cross ) aid if they ca n't keep up the demand themselves , unless they want to starve their prisoners or something on purpose , which according to the red cross at least does n't seem to have been the case , otherwise they would have mentioned it here :  the allied authorities took the view that unconditional surrender amounted to giving a free hand to the detaining powers as to the treatment they might give to military personnel who fell into their hands following the capitulation . 
  in fact , these men were frequently in a very different situation from that of their comrades who had been taken prisoner during the hostilities , since very often they had not even gone into action against the enemy . 
  although ** on the whole the treatment given to surrendered enemy personnel was fairly favourable ** , it presented certain disadvantages : prisoners in this category had their personal property impounded without any receipt being given ; they had no spokesman to represent them before the detaining power ; officers received no pay and other ranks , although compelled to work , got no wages ; in any penal proceedings they had the benefit of none of the guarantees provided by the convention . 
  most important of all , these men had no legal status and were at the entire mercy of the victor . 
  ** fortunately , they were well treated ** but this is no reason to overlook the fact that they were deprived of any status and all guarantees .

  there 's bound to be a dutch guy or two among those 160,000 ... 
  in my experience most european exchange students ( e.g. 
  france , slovenia etc ) who come here speak german quite well , students from outside of europe ( e.g. 
  often india and china for my university ) in computer science have usually very rudimentary knowledge of german at best , but a lot courses in cs at my university are taught exclusively in english ( even by german professors ) , so it 's likely that they anticipated that . 
  outside of tech fields it 's significantly more rare to find classes in english and unless you speak german beforehand there is no point to attend them . 
  if he meant to study german in germany ( e.g. 
  immersive language education ) that surely exists , but i 'm not familiar what the conditions are for people to get into those programs and get a visa for it from e.g. 
  i 'd imagine it 's likely rather hard . 
  civilian targets and the like are not avoidable in any armed conflict on that scale . 
  even with that , they have in the past tried to [ minimise civilian targets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roof_knocking ) . 
  israel is n't playing easy and is certainly restricting the citizens of gaza and the west bank , but it has also been obvious in the past that if they do n't , israeli children get kidnapped , civilians get attacked by rockets or suicide bombers are sent into their territory , so it would certainly be hard to convince them to be less hard handed . 
  i generally agree that israel is in a pretty bad situation geopolitically and was the victim of its neighbors many times , but the [ six-day war is generally regarded as the text-book example of a preemptive war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/preemptive_war#pre-september_11.2c_2001_united_nations_period_.281945.e2.80.932001.29 ) ( i.e. 
  they attacked first , thinking it would only be time until the other side did ) . 
   israel incorporates preemptive war in its strategic doctrine due to its lack of strategic depth . 
  the six-day war , which began when israel launched a successful attack on egypt on june 5 , 1967 , has been widely described as a preemptive war and is , according to the united states state department , `` perhaps the most cited example [ of preemption ] '' . 
  as a result of it they also occupied and settled the sinai peninsula , which they eventually guaranteed back to egypt and slowly desettled under heavy internal protest on the matter . 
  most do n't care either . 
  i 've seen peppers for instance that are clearly marked as ` israel ' before in my local super market . 
  not sure how it is in ireland , but here in germany vegetables and stuff are pretty much always clearly marked with their country of origin . 
  sounds unnecessary and nitpicky to add a label for specific things like this . 
  if you do n't want to support israeli settlers , then just do n't buy stuff from israel in general then . 
  the down votes on your original post are a bullshit , you tackled some stereotypes ( notably leaving out being overly religious ) . 
  i think it mostly stems from the fact that it is a fairly widely held position here on this and related subreddits that americans tend to overestimate the diversity between regions in the us or underestimate the ones in other similarly sized areas ( e.g. 
  europe , asia , africa ) . 
  even if the us is big , all regions share a lot more in common that european countries do amongst each other , you have things like a common language ( for the most part ) , similar/same tv channels/newspapers , often the same tv shows or movies are popular , similar history of getting founded etc. 
  there 's not really film industry that specifically markets to oklahoma or something for instance . 
  yeah sure , there are local news and stuff like that , but that 's on the same level as any other country has . 
  if you are looking at say distinct countries in europe the differences are perceived to be more fundamental . 
  so sometimes when americans go on about their country being so diverse it seems a bit like hyperbole , as all countries have within them some cultural variations or regions specific aspects . 
  when it seems like some people want to elevate the differences in culture between two us states to that of two very distinct countries ( e.g. 
  france and poland ) it seems out of proportion considering how much most us states still have in common in shared history , current events etc. 
  or american , 
  please be mindful and say ** lithuania ** when you say the e-word to not ruin the score . 
  should maybe be army or navy , or else luxembourgish , swiss german and icelandic etc. 
  remain dialects . 
  flip cup ? 
  it is indeed fairly random with some historic background thrown in ( e.g. 
  german has specific names for places where germans lived e.g. 
  places in transylvania ) . 
  the phenomena is called exonym . 
  [ wikipedia has some more info about it and how it tends to develop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exonym_and_endonym#tendencies_in_the_development_of_exonyms ) . 
  i 'd actually be interested to know if the offer was serious or if they expected poland to decline , like that serbia-austria situation before wwi . 
  but yeah it 's like in eu4 , ca n't have the stability drop for attacking when you have military access or stuff like this . 
  order must prevail . 
  i like how the map goes `` we do n't have the number for switzerland , but we all know it 's high . '', 
  the non-aggression treaty was canceled a few months before the attack ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact ) ) . 
   in october 1938 the nazi foreign minister joachim ribbentrop presented poland with the proposition of renewing the nonaggression treaty in exchange for allowing the free city of danzig ( gda\u0144sk ) to be annexed by germany and for permitting the building of an extraterritorial motorway and railway between east prussia and germany proper through the polish corridor , as well as germany accepting poland 's post war borders . 
  poland refused to accept these demands . 
  as a consequence , the non-aggression pact was unilaterally abrogated by adolf hitler on april 28 , 1939 , during an address before the reichstag , as germany renewed its territorial claims in poland . 
  after another few months of rising tension , germany invaded poland on september 1 , 1939 , initiating world war ii . 
  well here 's the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_erfnte1hgw a quick translation is : http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=naaduc4u she said things like that before , even on the bundesregierung youtube channel . 
  i give her at least credit for openly stating her opinions . 
  she did also at least say that it 's mostly her personal and party 's issue and she would not try to initiate such a new law that would make them equal . 
  ( there are other institutions in germany , other than the chancellor , that can try to initialise the process of adding new laws and they have not either . ), 
  to at least somewhat dissuade cross-border purchases maybe ? 
  or at least , not allow one country to give local companies an unfair advantage on the international market by not having high sales taxes . 
  the article about [ eu vat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_value_added_tax ) on wikipedia has some information . 
  specifically over the internet it seems a bit muddy , saying :  `` when goods or services are sold ( and sent ) to a private person across a border within the area , the buyer usually pays the sales country 's vat to the seller , and does not pay any vat in the buyer 's country . 
  but if the seller 's annual sales of goods to the buyer 's country exceed a threshold ( which varies by country ) , the seller must instead charge vat in the buyer 's country . 
  these are known as the distance selling rules . '', 
  not really sure how high these limits are or anything though or if it was just to prevent the administrative task of trying to go after every little shop that might be above them .
