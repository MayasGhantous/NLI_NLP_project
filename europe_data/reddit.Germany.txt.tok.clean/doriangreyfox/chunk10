  other than many on r/europe seem to believe , the attacks also have not much to do with merkel . 
  isis was able to smuggle people into europe well before her so called `` invitation '' and would still be able if there was a 15m high wall around us . 
  we only know the identity of one of the attackers so far and he was born and risen in france . 
  the hole story with the syrian refugee landing in greece is based on the found passport , which could have been planted on purpose ( who brings his real passport to a terror attack ? ) . 
  isis has openly condemned people fleeing to europe before and it is in it 's interest to stop it by strengthening right wing positions . 
  do you follow the conflict closely ? 
  isis is losing at all fronts at the moment , baiji has been taken by the iraqi forces , ramadi is encircled since quite a while and almost liberated , sinjar and al-hawl have been taken within only two days , around 300 dead isis fighters and only two dead kurds . 
  the most important supply line between raqqa and mosul has been cut . 
  kuweires airbase has been liberated by saa after a two year long siege by isis . 
  deir-ezz is a constant meatgrinder for isis offensives . 
  important propaganda figures like jihadi john or deso dogg have been killed recently . 
  isis can not advance very far into the other rebel 's territory because they only share a small common front and do n't battle their brothers of al-nusra with full efforts . 
  itt : people thinking that isis waited for merkels `` invitation '' before they sent a member via the refugee routes . 
  as if there was no possibility to get to europe on these routes before . 
  seriously ? 
  as if people had n't come before the so called `` invitation '' . 
  yeah sure , isis waited all the time for merkel 's `` invitation '' to send someone . 
  before that , there was absolutely no way to reach europe via the refugee routes . 
  seriously ? 
  merkel and germany have to be blamed for potential future problems but not for paris . 
  i did n't say or imply that other countries get less per capita . 
  i just wanted to hint at one of the reasons for the steady and stable growth of poland , especially when compared with russia . 
  nonetheless , if you check the source i 've cited , you will see that poland gets more than romania , czech republic and hungary combined , although the combined population of those is bigger . 
  poland gets roughly $ 76 bln out of the eu budget pool from 2014-2020 [ [ source ] ] ( http://msp.gov.pl/en/polish-economy/economic-news/4015,dok.html ) . 
  that means ~ 2 % of the current gdp of 525 bln usd is added to the gdp by the eu every year ( those evil bastards ) . 
  that 's a pretty independent source of growth . 
  of course this is not pure selflessness by the eu , but without these payments , the economy would look a lot worse . 
  [ money ] ( https://youtu.be/mdji8qo2nck?t=79 ), 
  yeah , totally comparable . 
  spending holiday in bangladesh will be much cheaper than spending holiday in czech republic as well . 
  there is no significant difference in the percentage of people with immigration background between germany ( ~ 20 % ) and france ( ~ 23 % ) . 
  i found one german source [ ( here ) ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/statistik-30-prozent-der-neugeborenen-sind-migrantenkinder/1883768.html ) which says that 30 % of german newborns have such parents , while they form ~ 20 % of the population . 
  i doubt that french immigrants are much different to german ones in terms of birthrate . 
  and you loose a lot in fees and bad exchange rates . 
  no sure if sarcasm because this argument is ridiculous . 
  it would be much cheaper to create incentive to have children . 
  if the french can do it , we can as well . 
  labour is becoming less dependent on humans every year . 
  we have the third highest robot density in the world . 
  if we would invest the 15 bn/year in automation ( this woiuld double our already high research budget ) , we would n't need to pay for unskilled immigration . 
  according to a recent article in `` die welt '' , a majority of the immigrants will be on state money for the first 15 years . 
  germany is already one of the densest populated countries in the world . 
   do you really think it 's so hard to hide ? 
  no , but it 's not lifestyle they are coming for . 
   why do they assume all of the thousands or tens of thousands arriving in germany every day will apply for asylum ? 
  because they will get deported if they do n't ? 
  just because deportation rates have been low in the last years , does n't mean it has to stay like this for all times . 
  the new law explicitly mentions faster and more efficient deportations . 
  there are mechanisms to determine the country of origin , if migrants suddenly forget it . 
  germany will ( have to ) change it 's sensitive stance in this regard and the new law is an important step . 
   ... why bother with it & make themselves visible to the authorities ? 
  few want to live a live here with the imminent threat of beeing caught and deported . 
  [ extended time lapse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjpsrqitsmq ) of how it was built . 
  make sure that he can control the conflict ? 
  effectively , he can turn the heat up and down now to make sure that his real enemies ( the west ) get the worst out of the situation . 
  these guys do n't view russia as a threat but rather as a saviour to europe . 
  i will never get the reasoning behind it but it 's a loud faction . 
  well , trump called belgium a city and brussels a `` hell hotel '' recently so junker is not entirely wrong with his assessment . 
  respect is not a one way street . 
  boris called erdogan a `` goat fucker '' not a long time ago . 
  still not sure who is the better diplomat here . 
   how does such an eu-army look like ? 
  similar to nato , the strongest defense union in the world ? 
   who serves in this army , what is the salary decided by the member states ? 
   what institution decides what this army does ? 
  a central command , similar to nato central command ? 
   you ca n't have an army where one of 27 entities can veto deployment which is not even an option in case of an attack against the block . 
  works for nato , should as well work for eu . 
   how do you handle things like taxes ? 
  similar to how the eu does it with the common budget ? 
  if we consider the defense case , it is an army . 
  a lot of stuff is standardized , there are many joint exercises and the defense plans usually involve all of nato . 
  in case of an attack it would act like one single army . 
  even in afghanistan nato acted as one army after 9/11 . 
  the bundeswehr did n't get their orders from the us . 
  i do n't get why people think that a common foreign policy is so important . 
  if one country is attacked , the attacker has a problem with the whole eu and thats it . 
  the eu army should be for defense and nothing else . 
  no eu ministry of foreign affairs needed to determine if we should react when someone attacks the eu . 
  these guys are most likely dead by now . 
  the video is from 2003 . 
   the largest bureaucratic mess this is just wrong . 
  the eu employs less civil servants than the city of munich . 
  it saves it 's member countries much more bureaucracy than it creates itself . 
  the amount of border protection staff we were able to reduce thanks to schengen is most likely higher than the total number of `` eu bureaucrats '' will ever be . 
  it 's just a buzzword , far away from the facts . 
  they would have had to lock up half of germany if they would 've been consequent . 
  he is stating his anecdotical opinion on a very fringe group of the turkish minority . 
  my personal experience is the complete opposite . 
  never met a  3rd generation turk who did n't speak a perfect accent-free german . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  sounds interesting . 
  what 's more surprising to me is that unemployment was on similar levels in 1995 and 1985 . 
  there are so many people constantly telling us how unemployment is the euro 's fault and mainly happening because spain can not devaluate its currency . 
  ~ ~ depends on how high these tariffs are . 
  in principle they could be connected to the eur-gbp exchange ratio . ~ ~ the eu has a lot more bargaining power in these talks than the uk because it has a lot less to loose . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phare  the phare programme is one of the three pre-accession instruments ** financed ** by the ** european union ** to assist the applicant countries of central and eastern europe in their preparations for joining the european union . 
   originally created in ** 1989 ** as the poland and hungary : assistance for restructuring their economies ( phare ) programme , phare has expanded from poland and hungary to currently cover ten countries . 
   painful reforms while ukraine did not which were a condition to join the evil eu . 
   like mentioning that poland grew her economy very fast since the end of communism while the exact reverse of this happened in ukraine because there was an accession process to the eu which started in 1989 including massive financial help .
