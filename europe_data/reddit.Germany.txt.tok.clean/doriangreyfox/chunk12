  it has to be done after it is reformed . 
  if it was your money you would talk differently . 
   otherwise known as a race to the bottom . 
  the capitalist economy system is by definition of a race to the bottom . 
  we are c, 
  except germany does n't have a  6 % surplus towards the eurozone . 
  no , china/asia/india had two to three times higher growth rates even when the eurozone countries were recklessly throwing money at their economies ( early 2000s ) . 
  but yeah , austerity is the root of all evil . 
  let 's solve the debt problem with more debt . 
   economically reorient the uk as a major trading hub , focusing more on the developing countries than on europe , since developing countries are expected to overtake europe in the next 50 years i have serious doubts that the uk can become a significant trading hub when rotterdam and le havre are just a stone throw away and directly connected to the second-largest economic zone of the world . 
  and i do n't see why developing countries would n't trade with the eu directly . 
  china has set its focus recently to the silk road 2.0 project circumventing traditional sea trade . 
  i still rather see the uk as a big financial hub which might even gain importance outside of eu regulations . 
  this will certainly not help the personal situation of the typical leave voter though . 
   `` portugal would be making a big mistake if it does not stick to its commitments , '' schaeuble told a news conference in berlin . 
   `` it would have to apply for a new programme , which it would get . 
  but the terms would be severe and it is not in portugal 's interests , '' he added . 
  sounds like he would n't have a problem with portugals finances if it was n't him who has to pay for it . 
  the uk does n't have the experts to negotiate 153 trade deals in the next 20 years which would be necessary to get back to the status quo . 
  and it has much less bargaining power in these talks compared to before . 
  poles seem to be a lot more sensitive to this stuff if it comes from us which is understandable . 
  those who think long term . 
  on both sides , rich and poor . 
  it does n't matter to the eu if the status quo is held for longer ( why would it ? ) . 
  they just want to call out the brexiters to live to their word . 
  if they do n't , it severely hurts their credibility and that of many other anti-eu movements . 
  i thought you were a supporter of `` the will of the people '' . 
  if the majority of londoners want back into the eu it would be democratic to let them have a referendum . 
   no it does n't . 
  yes it does . 
  why risk your life if you have a much smaller chance to reach your goals ? 
  also , this is just the start , the libyan engagement is about to be significantly increased . 
   civil war has erupted in libya and syria , and the eu twiddles it 's thumbs . 
  not true . 
  you could read up on that . 
  the eu can not stop civil wars by flicking with the finger . 
   very , very little has been done to stem the flow of them . 
  [ wrong ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pc5rr/number_of_refugees_immigrants_coming_to_the_eu/ ) . 
   the turkey route is not closed the rates dropped from  10k a day to 0 for most days . 
  what else do you want ? 
   visa-free travel i believe it when i see it . 
  at the moment , turkey does not fulfill the requirements for it ( anti-terror law ) and erdogan said he is not going to change that . 
   it 's still a boat ride across . 
  except it does n't make sense anymore . 
  there are deals with libya gaining momentum already , the libyan coast guard rescued 1500 migrants yesterday for example which wo n't get to europe now . 
  this sends a strong signal to potential followers . 
  frontex gets a stronger mandate , the turkey route is closed and the numbers of migrants from libya decreased compared to last year . 
  we are much closer to a solution than many here think . 
  however , many will miss the opportunity to hate on the eu and spread their backward nationalist propaganda . 
  btw , they do n't save `` thousands '' every day . 
  it was 55k since the beginning of this year . 
   ** libya 's navy ** intercepted about 1,000 migrants on board eight rubber boats off sabratha on thursday morning , spokesman ayoub qassem said . 
   as of wednesday , 56,328 boat migrants had been brought to italy in 2016 , a 5.5 percent ** decrease ** on the same period of last year , according to the interior ministry . 
  correct . 
  i consider the current and previous levels as sustainable and even beneficial in the long run if managed correctly . 
  yeah , they try to play this card as long as they can and this thread could be downvoted to oblivion soon because it does n't fit the narrative of the `` concerned citicens '' and brexit demagogues . 
  you will still have an undemocratic political system , mass immigration from pakistan and incompetent leaders afterwards . 
  what will be the tune if the eu can not be scapegoated anymore for their own failures ? 
   not going to work , as it stands now , leaders of our countries are becoming governors of eu . 
  the main body of the eu is the european council which is the only organ with real power . 
  and guess what , it consists of the heads of the member states . 
  how can they be their own governers ? 
   not enough time . 
  you 've had all the time in world . 
  in reality it is about making others responsible for your own failures . 
   the officials that make the decisions are n't elected . 
  any example or source for that ? 
  the comission can not bypass the european parliament and the european council , both of which are democratically elected . 
  except they have to implement some of the most important e.g. 
  freedom of movement which is the main problem according to many brexiters . 
   we would n't have more influence if we were inside . 
  so the right to veto important decisions is not more influence than beeing able to do exactly nothing . 
  interesting . 
  a huge part from your side of the discussion does though . 
  why is it important who proposes legislation if the final decision is up to democratically elected bodies ? 
  the comission ca n't do shit without knowing the ep and the ec will agree to it . 
  the uk can still veto when it comes to the important topics . 
  if it ends up with a status like norway ( which ukip praises regularly ) it would pay in more per capita than now and would n't have any say at all . 
  then how about change that before you whine about the eu beeing undemocratic when it actually is more democratic than the uk . 
  then maybe you should n't have voted for them . 
  this argument is ridiculous . 
  britain voted for free movement and actually pushed for the eastern expansion . 
  now the eu is responsible although the uk not only did n't veto it but actively supported these politics . 
   where is this disposedness to accept mediocrity coming from ? 
  from the fact that we are not mediocre ? 
  we are at position 7 in the international infrastructure index out of 100 countries compared [ [ source ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/264753/ranking-of-countries-according-to-the-general-quality-of-infrastructure/ ) ] and at the second position if we exclude small nations and city states . 
  of course we should aim for position 1 but claiming that the state is `` horrible '' is just factually wrong and shows a severe lack of discernment . 
  still better than in the us which is the most important country in terms of technology . 
  so it ca n't be that bad . 
   this anonymous burocratic apparatus ... is controlled to 100 % by the democratically elected heads of the member states because it has exactly zero real power ( no executive ) . 
   there 's some truth in that tbf . 
  so the positive case needs to be made a lot better than it has been so far . 
  the true power in the eu still comes from the elected heads of states of the member countries ( ec ) because they are the only ones with a real executive power . 
  the comission and the parliament could be dismissed the next day and there would be nothing they could do about it . 
  exactly . 
  how do you want to compete when the other side is free to promise milk and honey while you can not do that for obvious reasons . 
  i do n't know where you live but where i live all three are far from a `` horrible state '' . 
  it could be better as it always could . 
  and never in history has it been better than now . 
  compared to other first world nations we are at the very top .
