  you should read the article again . 
  a majority is defending the gdr in a sense that `` not everything was bad '' . 
  the article nowhere states that these people would prefer living under communism . 
   ** eight percent ** of eastern germans flatly oppose all criticism of their former home and agree with the statement : `` the gdr had , for the most part , good sides . 
  life there was happier and better than in reunified germany today . '', 
  glorifying the past is very human and psychologically explainable . 
  the survey was limited the departement bouches-du-rh\u00f4ne which is rather small and mainly consists of marseille which is the city with the highest muslim ratio in france ( 25 % acc.to wiki ) . 
  im rather surprised that the numbers are that low for this region . 
  sorry to disappoint you . 
  and i think before russia does something insane like this , our world would have changed so much that it 's not worth to speculate about it now . 
  compared to crimea or donbass which were surprising admittedly , this would be on a whole different level . 
  there is a reason why they did n't go into territory with a < 40 % share of ethnic russians . 
  if russia attacks a nato or eu country , we will have other problems than russian gas . 
  a lot has to happen before such an attack becomes a realistic option for russia and they would have shut up our gas long before it . 
  it would be suicide for them to kill us soldiers in an act of aggression . 
  germany followed the us to afghanistan , they would also follow to romania . 
  nye events were in cologne . 
   the us and uk militaries come to romania often for joint exercises , but i honestly ca n't remember the last time the germans or french came here , maybe you are just misinformed . 
  germany takes part at most of the relevant nato exercises . 
  germany had the third largest deployment in afghanistan and 57 soldiers gave their lifes for our allies . 
  romania is much more important to us than afghanistan . 
  you can check the stats . 
  they show that this is not the case . 
  the eu is not a bureaucratic monster . 
  how about you read the article before you post a wall of text full with unfounded theories and anti-german sentiment ? 
  why should we trust you more than the guardian ? 
  quote from the article :  the uk stance was in part motivated by a desire to protect the dairy sector , despite research indicating that ammonia-based fertilisers -- rather than saharan dust -- were responsible for britain 's worst pollution event in a decade . 
  it 's not about emissions from coal plants . 
   limits on methane , a potent greenhouse gas , had already been removed from an eu proposal seen by the guardian , after pressure from the uk and other states , including france , italy and poland . 
  no mention of germany . 
  and then :  some 85 % of ammonia emissions come from just 20 % of the uk 's farms , mostly the largest ones , according to eurostat data . 
  thing is the problems of a cut trade relationship would be shared between 27 member states while britain would have to carry its alone . 
  and you are importing stuff from the eu because it is the best deal for you not only because other countries like it . 
  if the eu would stop any trade , they would lose maybe ten percent or something . 
  the uk would lose 60 % and basically be wrecked . 
  this is a strong negotiation position . 
  calling someone a refugee is not an ad hominem . 
  so they disagree with facts . 
  sadly that has been my impression of many eurosceptics lately . 
  why do you always use the same buzzwords without giving convincing examples . 
  i will give you one : the so called eu bureaucracy has less civil servants than the city of hamburg . 
  do you have examples for those `` non-existing '' problems ? 
  what horrific law has been dictated lately ? 
   that 's economy 101 , you specialize ... why is everybody driving german cars and not chinese ones ? 
  economy does not only consist of cars . 
  why does everyone buy chinese smartphones and not german ones ? 
  we do n't want it as badly as you want to trade with the whole rest of the eu . 
  you are by far not our biggest customer . 
  your trade with the eu is more than five times the trade with all 52 commonwealth countries combined ( according to john major ) . 
  you would definetively have to move towards the eu position in trade negotiations because you have much more to lose than any single member state . 
  germany could also benefit if frankfurt becomes the new main financial hub of the eu . 
  calling out hypocrisy and selfishness is not automatically tu quoque . 
  it could be more democratic but it is still far from undemocratic . 
  because the latest trash `` documentary '' on youtube and the comments below it say so i guess . 
  the dalai lama is a refugee himself . 
  sadly , a loud part of r/europe thinks similarly . 
  golf gte and bmw i3 ( without rex option ) are pure ev 's as well . 
  discussing with tesla fanboys is like discussing on r/russia sometimes . 
   yes , sorry , that might be inaccurate . 
  here is a newer statistic of their sales . 
  it 's not inaccurate , it 's plain wrong . 
  your source is meaningless without comparison to other ev manufacturers . 
   tesla were not even though they are the biggest seller of evs in germany . 
  they are by far not the biggest seller [ [ source ] ( http://evobsession.com/german-ev-sales-split-february-2016/ ) ] . 
   the nuclear submarines are irrelevant , why ? 
  do you think the us would risk to catch a few nuclear missiles with multiple hiroshima equivalents in new york , san francisco etc. ? 
  the latest russian submarine rockets can carry six warheads , each with 150 kt yield which is ten times the power of the hiroshima bomb . 
  if that 's not a second strike capability then what else is ? 
   if those arguments are ridiculous then why did the usa almost start ww3 over the cuban missile crisis ? 
  at this time , the nuclear submarines as well as the warheads were n't as developed so stationed missiles were far more of a danger to the second strike capability . 
  furthermore , these missiles were not defensive but stationed to be used in an attack . 
  i will never understand the russian whining while they have icbms pointing at any bigger european city without beeing realistically threatened in a nuclear way by us . 
  and if some eastern countries prefer to have a defense shield and do n't threaten russia remotely in the same way as russia threatens them , the big victim cries start . 
  ridiculous . 
  never heard of nuclear submarines ? 
  do n't you know that russian rockets attacking the us would fly over the north pole or via alaska anyways ? 
  forgot about those tupolevs which are in the air 24/7 and potentially carry cruise missiles with nuclear warheads ? 
  these arguments are ridiculous and just show that russia does n't want to lose an option to bully europe . 
  of couse he would not defend that statement to stay electable . 
  the fact that he was able to molest the parliament with such a bs parliamentary question in 2013 , especially as an airline technician , shows to me that this guy is a very questionable person . 
  [ here . 
   actually he does not . 
  which is one of the most bullshit sentences i 've ever heard . 
  i did n't say that . 
  twice that number was arriving ** per day ** , when `` mass immigration '' became a term . 
  10.000 per month is nothing if you check the history of this kind of immigration and if you consider that these people are sooner or later sent to northern countries anyways . 
  well , hofer believes in chemtrails and is part of a pan-german fraternity . 
  nothing to worry about . 
  no people arriving in lesbos is mainly because turkey is now actively preventing it . 
  the migrants would still rather go to greece than stay in turkey . 
  the balkan borders are only a part of this picture . 
  and winter is over since a few months . 
  [ they do n't have to ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugees-and-migrants-arriving-in-greece-from-turkey-down-90-per-cent-says-border-agency-a7029081.html ), 
  of a 72 year old . 
  wtf ? 
  did you notice that the mass-immigration basically stopped a few months ago ? 
  i guess those politicians changed their mind . 
  otherwise , mass-immigration would continue .
