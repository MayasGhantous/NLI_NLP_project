   ca n't fix that with endless austerity i did n't say that and i agree . 
  a part of istanbul is in europe by definition . 
  it was even european capital of culture in 2010 [ [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_capital_of_culture ) ] . 
  you are correct , depending on the calculation , public sector is the biggest employer in most countries . 
  still , i do n't think we have to discuss that greece had a bloated public sector with one of the lowest efficiencies in the developed world for a long time . 
  nixon ended it in 1971 . 
  the us had the gold standard back then . 
  so printing without limit was n't possible . 
   ... except during the new deal era , the government was the largest employer , and government `` debt '' was what paid for it all so it was ( source ? ), 
  an answer to the crisis , not the reason and core problem . 
   by 1945 fdr had grown the national debt from $ 20bn to $ 260bn ( in 1945 dollars ) , with increases of 50 % a year in the years right after the crash . 
  yeah , there was a very expensive event between 1941 and 1945 . 
  from 20 bn to 30 bn in the first year is n't really a big step and not comparable to what greece did . 
  you forgot turkey . 
  and the economy was not built on government debt with the public sector as it 's largest employer . 
  eu structural funds add ~ 3 % to the gdp of poland every year . 
  between 2007 and 2013 it was $ 137 bn in total , which means ~ $ 23 bn per year . 
  thats about 4.4 % of 2013 nominal gdp ( $ 517 bn ) [ [ source ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_poland ) . 
  do n't know when exactly eu payments started though . 
  ukraine does n't get this money so far , but hopefully in the future . 
  i am impressed by your reading comprehension and argumentation skills !, 
  lol . 
  i never said nor suggested that . 
  `` i made no contact with anyone '' - good approach `` the streets were made wider so that they could have missiles go down in the middle of the street '' - he tells it as if all streets were made wider because of the missiles which is bs . 
  `` one thing about russia , still today i think , is that noone has any money '' - bs , especially in moscow `` at least one of these kids killed those guys '' - most likely a joke i personally do n't find the speech offensive , knowing that most of it is exaggerated for the sake of a good story . 
  however , i do n't like it when people brag with questionable attitudes like `` i 've always been a big loser in math , hahaha '' . 
  it 's entertainment , i know . 
  and it would n't be funny if he made a politically correct speech with no factual errors or exaggerations . 
  but i can understand when russians feel offended in this case . 
  no one is . 
  but some appear to be more influenced than others . 
  you can still hear a good portion of cultural ignorance somewhat proudly presented . 
  quote from wikipedia :  in everyday english usage , allies are people , groups , or states that have joined in an alliance for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose , whether or not explicit agreement has been worked out between them . 
  even if it was for a short time , they were technically allies . 
  the first does not exclude the latter . 
  because appeasing is a little different to annexing and attacking ? 
   who forget ( presumably on purpose in order to make a trite point ) that germany had experience of a two front war and took steps to shore up their eastern flank to prevent it happening again . 
  does this make the russian occupation of eastern poland or the war against finland any better ? 
  as far as i remember , russian public ranked her third , not that bad . 
   furthermore china is at the top of patents grants nr . 
  of patents ! = innovation  there was never a link with autocracy and innovation ( prussia , imperial germany , ussr , japan and little asians tigers ) the first four lost in the game . 
  they were innovative to an extend but not as innovative as their competing nations or failed for other reasons ( e.g. 
  through becoming fascists ) . 
  the little asian tigers were never more than workbenches until they opened up their societies . 
   south korea was a dictatorship until the late 80 's under the unelected military general/dictator chun doo-hwan yes but it 's giant leap from a workbench to a true innovator correlates with the development into a liberal society . 
   there is a lot of evidence that infant economies grow reasonably well under some mild form of autocracy you have a point here . 
  the question / u/cieloroto raises is what happens if the infant state is over . 
  south korea is basically a liberal democracy with a free press ( before japan on the index ) . 
  it 's still not proven if people in a non-liberal society can leave their role as workbenches and create markets with the innovative pace of liberal countries . 
  japan and south korea still are/were the only countries capable of true innovation in asia in my perception . 
  yeah i mean that quote is part of a poem , so not his own words . 
  citing it in public is still strange ... 
  if renzi was citing lines comparable to [ `` the mosques are our barracks , the domes our helmets , the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers ... '' ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2270642.stm ) , i would be worried as well . 
  so putin was wrong with his sanctions backfire stuff ... 
  finn detected . 
  looking at [ this ] ( http://solargis.info/doc/_pics/freemaps/1000px/ghi/solargis-solar-map-africa-and-middle-east-en.png ) map , it is in fact around 20 % higher compared to southern spain . 
  with a ~ 1000 km longer distance , we can expect some extra losses in the hvdc cables of around 6 % though . 
  edit : did some more research , hvdc losses are more around 2.8 % / 1000km in the case of desertec transmission lines, 
  i do n't get why desertec was planned for some north african countries while southern spain has almost the same solar potential . 
  why do n't we build some huge plants there , support a politically stable eu country and transfer the energy with some hvdc cables to other parts of europe . 
  i would assume that it 's a better deal than investing the money in potential civil war countries just because they might have a few percents more irradiation . 
  [ this article comes up with a more likely explanation imo ] ( http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2014/01/23/likes-lies-perfectly-honest-businesses-can-overrun-facebook-spammers/ )  bob believes that one day , facebook will recognize the problem and purge the fake profiles . 
  but by that time , bob worries that the sudden spam fan decrease will actually end up damaging his page . 
  `` the outward appearance to my real fans will be that i bought a s ** tload of fake likes , which is n't the case and will be severely damaging to the social media aspect of my business , '' he said . 
  `` and those people who actually paid for the reach , without knowing , actually did buy fake likes !, 
   i 've seen a few vocal people assume the ukrainian economy will bounce back , and return to big growth , and improvement overall . 
  i do n't remember anyone saying that it would happen this year or next year . 
  from my travel experience , i can say that merkel is actually quite known in countries where you would not expect it . 
  still better than atomfried . 
  max planck society has more employees and most of them have no teaching duties . 
  so not directly comparable to universities whose main purpose is the education of students . 
  research is not everything . 
  if i compare lectures from ivy league universities to what i had to endure in some better german universities , the difference is huge . 
  there are some other important ones like `` universities in the worlds top 50 '' which are not mentioned . 
  i guess it 's because making fun of people suffering is not that much upvote-worthy . 
  any finn care to explain what `` optimal equipment '' is . 
  should n't it read `` optical '' ? 
  there is a special reason , long tradition and duty for germany to take part of the ww2 commemoration . 
  while visiting russia before visiting the closest allies is a bit unusual for a freshly elected eu prime minister . 
   will the us delay its rate rise and suffer worse inflation ? 
  us economy saw a growth of 0.2 % for the first quarter ( if stretched to the whole year ) . 
  i think the fed will delay its rate rise . 
  it 's made in the very same style as the `` i 'm an american citizen '' video , by which they tried to prove an academi involvement during the donetsk protests . 
  cyberberkut claims , that they stole this video from azov . 
  so according to them it was not supposed to be used as a pr video . 
  edit : i agree that the whole setup seems to be made for the camera though . 
  and i remember a very similar video from the pro-russian side which alledgedly shows right sector hanging a guy . 
  similar video quality and also without showing the end . 
  what still makes me unsure about the crucifixion is the fact that they hit the guy in the balls in the process . 
  would they do that if it was staged ? 
  another possibility could be , that it 's a mock execution that was n't finished . 
  according to eurostat , [ bratislava region is on the 5th position in gdp per capita ppp compared with other regions in the eu ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/5173650/1-27022014-ap-en.pdf/a46ded44-83cf-4368-9315-27f96bcc3a0e?version=1.0 ) . 
  because your country meanwhile has a similar or higher gdp per capita ppp than the former gdr states ? 
  the eelt is actually ~ 60 % larger in terms of aperture area compared to the tmt . 
  i would suggest , the us just add their 492 mirror segments to the eelt to create an even bigger telescope . 
  `` fight between the believers and the non-believers '' good luck with fighting against an alliance of europe , the us , china , russia and india . 
  because he does n't have to serve a comparable debt with his primary surplus . 
  the number of 4.5 % is insane though . 
  not in their home countries of course but in intermediate countries like libya , turkey , jordan or eu bordering countries in general . 
  his concept could be expanded such that asylum seekers can apply at the embassies of the country they want to go to .
