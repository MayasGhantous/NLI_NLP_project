  of course , these would basically need to look like refugee camps to deal with the mass of applicants . 
  we should give each applicant the same chances , especially families and we should not prefer the most agressive and shifty young men , many of whom coming for economic reasons . 
  still better than the [ original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61pzqtl3a8m ), 
  the rhine as the backbone of the old eu and the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) . 
  and the historic development of silicon valley . 
  as europe still profits from its leading position during the second industrial revolution ( steel , electricity , mass production etc ) , the us profits from its edge in the third industrial revolution ( semiconductors ) . 
  it is really difficult to compete with the place where the seed was planted . 
  well , it is obvious . 
  one of the reasons is english proficiency . 
  one difference is that one is fluent in english and one is not ( which can be understood since he is 72 years old ) . 
  thats a great development . 
  from the community rules : * it is ok to criticise immigration . 
  * it is ok to criticise members of minority groups . 
  * it is not ok to suggest that members of different cultures or races are incapable of cohabiting . 
  * it is not ok to suggest that some races or cultures are inherently better than others . 
  this year you will most likely have a higher gdp per capita ppp than the german regions of former gdr . 
  time to invest us some money back ... 
  throw christians overboard on their way to countries full of christians . 
  what intentions do they have ? 
  how many have similar intentions without throwing somebody overboard ? 
  throwing money at the problem is it neither . 
  reform is the answer , which has to be connected with reduced government spending in the case of greece . 
  i can quote another [ source ] ( http://www.izajoels.com/content/1/1/3 ) :  on the other hand , various flexibility instruments at the firm level , combined with discretionary adjustments of the institutional framework by policy makers ( i.e. 
  enhancement of the short-time work schemes ) , enabled firms to adjust their workforce along the internal rather than the external margin ( m\u00f6ller [ 2010 ] ) . 
  in addition , far reaching labor market reforms between 2002 and 2005 , initiated to fight the high and persistent unemployment that had evolved since the end of the seventies , had significantly altered the core elements of the labor market , including active and passive labor market policies , the organizational structure of labor offices as well as the pension system . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.28.1.167 ) source sums it up quite well . 
  i doubt that bill gates has $ 323 bn to spend . 
   germany carried out austerity during the biggest economic boom in human history . 
  germany was known as `` the sick man of europe '' at that time . 
  believe me , i was there . 
  greek economy is far from being comparable to that of the us . 
  you can see the difference in the interest rates greece has/had to pay for its loans compared to the us . 
  if the greek economy would promise a reasonable roi , private investors would throw their money at them . 
  at least he wears a skater helmet instead of a bicycle one and no knee protection . 
  these people make me wan na throw some euromonies at them . 
  eu could triple their gdp by giving them our unused [ budget commitments ] ( http://insideurope.eu/node/534 ) . 
  [ meanwhile in ivano-frankivsk ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ccjfeacxiae1cpa.jpg ), 
   humans ( me obviously inclusive ) are not ready for a single-man-rule yet . 
  i tend to disagree . 
  i think we are over it once and for all . 
  our societies are too diverse and advanced for it . 
  in the same sense as one person can not develop an iphone , a single person can not make the best decisions for a demanding electorate as we have it in developed countries nowadays . 
  maybe we will be ruled by a hyperintelligent ai in the future though . 
  get on my level beaches !, 
  i doubt , that `` most of the people '' do a similarly demanding job . 
  although many think they could do it better . 
  maybe we can form a joint battlegroup . 
  we point the broomsticks to the enemy and you say `` bang bang '' . 
  division of work . 
  germany was an occupied country for many years . 
  easier to trust if you know your army can intervene easily whenever necessary . 
  judging your sense of humour and grumpiness , you could well be one of us . 
  i stopped watching when she used the word `` economic wars '' . 
  why would any euro country want to lead an economic war against greece ? 
  how is pumping billions and billions of euros into a country with no chance to ever see it again benefitial for the creditor nations ? 
  sure , there is no doubt that the us have the strongest navy by far . 
  nonetheless , the usefulness of carrier fleets against a highly developed opponent is sometimes overestimated in my opinion . 
  they still manage to sink us carriers with their submarines in exercises from time to time . 
  according to some [ german sources ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/suedafrika-bundeswehr-beschiesst-versehentlich-motorboot-a-1026011.html ) the `` marine '' admitted it was them . 
  paris seems to absorb the innovations from around itself . 
  i remember it well from my ryanair flight to riga . 
  saw a hot stewardess entering the cockpit as a pilot left it . 
  they seemed to be flirty chatting so my first ~ ~ thought ~ ~ fantasy was that they must be doing something dirty inside . 
  switzerland would probably be of a deep black . 
  disappointed that they are not included . 
  edit : my guess was wrong . 
  had some different stats in mind , where they are the [ world innovation leaders ] ( http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2014/article_0010.html ) . 
  i am waiting for the day , google releases its first tunnel drilling machine and apple makes the first lithography stepper . 
  i would love to see the creation of an artificial european language comparable to esperanto . 
  or we could alternatively switch to ancient latin . 
  that would make us sound badass as hell . 
  why would poland or the baltics do `` naturally better '' ? 
  ukraine and poland started on a similar level in the early 90s . 
  guess who of them chose russia . 
  i can see it even without stopping . 
  please note , that the pics are switched in the still provided by / u/lm24 . 
  you need to have a look on the left one in the vid . 
  excellent find !, 
  edit : maybe it 's a triple fake ? 
  they might have inserted these artifacts on purpose . 
  looks like dayz, 
  trennungsvaeter e.v. 
  is for sure an unbiased source . 
  not . 
  maybe they only count exports to outside the eu or eurozone . 
  another interesting fact : [ worlds nr . 
  4 in robots per manufacturing workforce ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/01/08/top-countries-robots-workforce_n_2434503.html ) . 
  ahead of the us . 
  the next swedish coup incoming . 
  why is the last one too vague ? 
  do you follow russian media ? 
  whats the difference between `` the jews poisoned our wells '' and `` the ukrainians crucify russian kids '' ? 
  i would say the prefix `` semi '' is appropriate , if three of four criteria are more or less matched . 
  i do n't say russia is on a germany 1945 level , but maybe on a 1935 level . 
  i did not mean completely gay but with certain tendencies . 
  societies like ancient rome or greece show , that bisexualitiy can be quite common , if it 's not socially suppressed . 
  definition of fascism according to oxford dictionary :  an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization . 
   fascism tends to include a belief in the supremacy of one national or ethnic group , see the view of many russians on ukrainians  a contempt for democracy , check  an insistence on obedience to a powerful leader , more or less  and a strong demagogic approach check not every point is matched to the fullest but `` quasi-fascist '' is a fair description imo . 
  they follow a book and therefore another persons opinion . 
  persons who wrote those books as instruments of power where obviously scared of homosexuality .
