  example 2014 : 200k refugees and 10k deportations . 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/inflation-cpi on this site you can look at german inflation . 
  before we joined the euro we often had much more than 2 % . 
  and the ecb should lookt at eurzone inflation not just at germany . 
  i would have no problem with higher wages and more infastructure spending . 
  i have always liked the german version of [ where have all the flowers gone ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/where_have_all_the_flowers_gone%3f ) sung by marlene dietrich . 
  isnt the oil price responsible for 90 % of the economic problems ? 
  its not about professions you can extend this to all subgroups within a society . 
  do you want to be punished for things you didnt do ? 
  i want to be treated as an individual and not as a member of a group . 
  edit : and yes he lacks empathy if he thinks its ok to murder people . 
  so the police men that were murdered where the same that murdered/killed the students ? 
  exactly the same ? 
  collective punishment is a very very bad idea . 
  btw . 
  a lot of police officers are hard working people . 
  your view of the world is black/white and doesnt do justice to the complex world we live in . 
  what would you think if some militant organisation would decide that all germans need to be killed and your friends and family would be among the victims ? 
  in my opinion you lack empathy with your fellow human beings . 
  tell that to the parents/friends/family of the murdered . 
  for them the world surely became a better place . 
  if you think you need to kill innocent people you make the world worse not better . 
  the crimes of the police do not justify murder . 
  there are crazy people on both sides . 
  here for you : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction edit : leftist terrorist organisation . 
  killed a lot of innocent people including police men . 
  there goes my tax money : /, 
  my point is that in most cases its not european governments that owe each other . 
  its banks , private people etc. 
  therefore countries can not forgive these debts . 
  at the moment only the debts of greece are in the hands of the eurozone governements . 
  so we could help greece but not italy , spain etc. 
  so i think my comment was relevant . 
  and if 80 % of `` the people '' are angry and vote anti-euro parties than this is very bad for greece . 
  if angela merkel was a queen she could pay even if `` the people '' didnt want it . 
  therefore democracy has everything to do with it . 
  because if you need german money you need parties in governement that are willing to pay . 
  so its no too smart to antagonize the people you need support from . 
  you could argue that the current germany is already vastly different from the germany of the 1940 . 
  just look at how many people migrated here from around the world . 
  they should care if they want money from germany ( you know democracy etc. 
  most debts of the southern europeans with the exception of greece isnt held by eurozone governements and therefore cant be fogiven by them . 
  edit : i really dont like it if people downvote me for stating facts . 
  this for example https://lupocattivoblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/griechenland-inselverkauf.jpg `` sell your island and acropolis you bankrupt greeks '' you dont think thats offensive or insulting ? 
  thats like demanding the pyramids from the agyptians or selling the eifel tower . 
  edit : or a recent one : http://meedia.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/6w650c0.bild_.jpg `` no !, 
  further billions for the greedy greeks . '', 
  they did . 
  calling greeks lazy and corrupt etc. 
  yes , but if we have no time limits and germany still exists in 500 years do germans of the year 2500 still have to pay ? 
  most germans didnt . 
  and as long as germany is a democracy this is very important . 
  the question is : how far do we go back then ? 
  because a lot of europeans had benefits because of the wars of their ancestors . 
  greece knew about the no-bailout clause when they signed up for the euro . 
  its even worse to connect a very serious issue like wwii repartions with the debt crisis of 2015 . 
  i dont like it to use such issues to score some ( mostly domestic ) political points . 
  information : axel springer is the publisher of bild . 
  i like this one more : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stdnfwcnkrm, 
  i watched some horror movies when i was 10-12 years old but real beheadings or executions are on a whole different level . 
  of course i had no internet access when i was that age ... 
  on the positive side boobs are no problem in germany :p edit : its has improved a lot in recent years . 
  futhermore the video above was the 2004/16year/usk16 version . 
  you could buy the 18year/usk18 version without any cuts . 
  i know that the eu funds worked especially well in poland . 
  how does it work in romania ? 
  for germany the end of the ussr/re-unification and the eastwards expansion of the eu was one of the best things that ever happened to us . 
  edit : not just because of the economy . 
  i feels really good to know that all our neighbours are very good partners/friends . 
   whether other members provide financial aid , and under which conditions , is entirely up to them . . 
  this is an important point we should never forget . 
  the nation states decide over their money not the eu . 
  and only as a part of a united europe with a european army . 
  it would be a european superpower with a german speaking minority . 
  not a german led europe . 
  hehe , jo  . 
  i thought i should provide an example and the `` killerspiel '' discussion is a perfect one . 
  ~ ~ germany has some history with banning or censoring violent games/games with wwii symbols . ~ ~ a popular term for ego-shooters among politicians was `` killerspiele '' which literally means `` killer games ; murderer games '' . 
  some of them wanted to ban all ego-shooters from germany . 
  no , they didnt ban minecraft :p . but germany has a past of games cencorship . 
  yep , also gema , general attitude towards new technology in germany :d ps : in recent years more people migrated ( mostly with turkish roots ) to turkey than the other way . 
  maybe turkish gamers will complain about the german influence to their culture in the future . 
  / s edit : with my `` yep '' i meant the `` ridiculous bans on wolfenstein and similar games '' not minecraft, 
  ah , it seems they have learned from germany . 
  sometimes i would really like to live in new zealand . 
  far away from all the crazies . 
  thats one of the reasons why the blame game should stop . 
  because in the end neither merkel nor tsipras are kings and if the voters get to fed up with each other and vote for anti-eu , anti euro parties we will have much bigger problems than now . 
  ps : i have sometimes the feeling that some greeks dont understand that merkel and sch\u00e4uble are not the worst that could happen in germany . 
  and that we also have a democracy that is able to vote for different , non-eu forces . 
  if this blame game doesnt end there will be a german/dutch/finnish anti-euro syrizas . 
  its even worse that this parties would most likely be ( very ) right wing . 
  the worst thing is that alot of people hear in germany were very sympathic until some of the comments in the last weeks . 
  even my conservative father said we have to reduce debt for them and invest more in europe . 
  there are more newspapers and views than bild in germany . 
  did they know that this was because so many refugees came to germany in 2014 ? 
  do you still have contact and if what do they think about life in germany ? 
  i think thats normal . 
  now and then you hear or see stories about germans that have emigrated to other countries and there is almost always a certain amount of naivety involved . 
  how was their live in the asylum shelter ?
