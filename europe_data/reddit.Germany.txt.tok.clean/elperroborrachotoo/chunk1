... because there 's nothing that could possibly be said , right ? 
  right ?? 
  i am pretty proud of the restraint in this thread . 
  i 'm pretty certain it 's meant ot be symbolic rather than `` true '' ( whatever that would mean in this context ), 
  in 2020 , the prime exports of finland were : * education * vodka , to compensate for the effects, 
  if that is so , maybe it 's not even the government 's fault . 
  only they were almost never sung , because of that one bastard line * deutschland einig vaterland * ( germany united fatherland ) so you 'd just stand there and hear the melody played , and try to hide behind the first row so noone relevant could see you `` forgot '' your * fdj-hemd * . 
  because it does n't say `` fuck you '' . 
  maybe . 
  i 've read that , but without establishing a base rate that increase is pretty meaningless - except that i ca n't imagine * any * base rate of failure where a 30 % increase is the difference between `` rock solid '' and `` omg the sky is falling '' . 
  i can only assume the author was able to select one of the better examples . 
  yet as much as can be gleaned from the text , that shining beacon of hurt simpy did n't protect themselves . 
  now , i have no qualms socializing such cost by providing a top-notch infrastructure . 
  yet with so many people told * the good times are over , adapt or die * , and the massive exemptions for the mfg industries get , i fail to see why the public should accept extra cost just so these companies can do business as usual . 
  * edit removed gibberish, 
  yes i did , right after you linked it . 
  well now , there 's something impressive and scary about that article . 
  scary is hooking up heavy machinery directly , when a 1ms voltage dip can cause $ 10k of machine damage , downtime and `` could lead to a fire '' . 
  reading between the lines it sounds like the voltage watchdog was overly sensitive . 
  now , the impressive part is that the grid was stable enough that someone thought * `` this setup is a good idea '' * , and it seems to have worked indeed for quite a while , too . 
  -- in my work experience , every change - even within specification - brings up some user who relies on the current behavior and gets upset about changes . 
  i understand that a 150k investment is n't made easily and might hurt the company at an unfortunate time . 
  but when do you think they 'll say * `` now would be fine '' * ? 
  putting on the cynic cap : it 's just a polemic piece in favor of the factory that wants utility companies to pay more . 
  it 's interesting at least that it 's an aluminum mill - one of the most power hungry industries already enjoying massive exemptions from paying the * \u00d6kostrom-umlage * . 
  stability regarding frequency and voltage ? 
  i understand that managing this is a garganteous task , and has become much harder with renewables ( so one could assume relative quality has gone down . ), 
  yet i 've never heardf of consumers - private or industrial - to have significant problems because of the variations . 
   the us gets hit with a lot more natural disasters i 'm not sure if enron counts as a * natural * disaster . 
  but yeah , we ca n't blindly compare numbers . 
   having huge problems with it what do you mean ? 
  as in `` hard to solve '' - certainly . 
  still , germany has one of the most reliable power grids . 
  your country does a fantastic job to promote itself to the people who were there once . 
  i understand that tourism is more or less the only thing that can replace the income from fishing and textile . 
  yet a lot of portugals magic is that you can easily get away from the bulk of visitors . 
  all the amazing us civil rights apply to citizens . 
  if i 'm a furinner visiting the states - for whatever reason - my only cover is the us ' meticulous compliance with international treatments . 
  but everone * chose * to paint taxis the same color by electing a government that mandates that !, 
  you are doing every redditors work !, 
  there 's always a palce on my balcony for you . 
  * glued, 
  i grew up in an atheist environment , i would n't even say `` extremely '' - it was just the default in en environment where you do n't question defaults lightly . 
  looking back , i guess i started to get religion-curious when i realized that some of my friends and classmates had a christian background all of the time ; despite all the adolescent dissection of the world , it never really came up . 
  well , this has been reported a few times and , as usual , the further it got away the more ... interpretetive it became . 
  [ here 's the paper ] ( http://www.norc.org/pdfs/beliefs_about_god_report.pdf ) . 
  fwiw , guardian links to the original pretty prominentlystudy , which is a big plus . 
  did you try , * going to the [ original study ] ( http://www.norc.org/pdfs/beliefs_about_god_report.pdf ) * , maybe ? 
  thank you , 
  have you considered the option that maybe it does n't matter much ? 
  -- religion is a very personal thing in east germany - `` do you believe in god '' is almost as socially awkward as asking `` do you like doggie-style '' in the us heartlands . 
  plus , there 's little - if any - fanatism in religousness here . 
  in practice , it 's more about the community and an alternative to materialism , a framework for activity , rather than a crusade against the unbelievers . 
  * ahem * before the fall of the wall : church membership or getting involved with the church was , at best and for very few exceptions , a career limiting move . 
  ( e.g. 
  excluding you from a higher education . 
  typically , it could also affect your family . ), 
  this was reinforced by the church groups being somewhat of a haven of resistance . 
  a strong secular infrastructure competing with christian traditions ( youth organization , * jugendweihe * , etc. 
  ) , with a lot of pressure to participate ; the ones who did n't always were the odd one 's out . 
  many church buildings were forcefully repurposed . 
  all social and historic education , in respect to religion was that this is some dark-age / peasant oppression shit that we enlightened people have overcome . 
  which means for the under-28 's they grew up in a predominantly atheist environment . 
  tl ; dr i grew up in r/atheism 's wet dream , and it was all fun and games . 
  -- still , comparing to other countries - e.g. 
  post-curtain poland - might be interesting . 
  i can * speculate * why religion rekindled in other countries but largely not in east germany . 
  facts - or at least a more educated opinion - would be much more valuable , though . 
  iir the original reporting correctly , it was * not enough people to be statistically significant * , primarily because of the * under 28 * requirement . 
  pleasant ? 
  it was killing me !, 
  i am certain ikea will have good business tomorrow when we replace all the furniture with teeth marks . 
  still , pulling the * '' ... and it 's all legal '' * rug from under their feet . 
  well , not exactly pulling the rug , more like plucking at the fringes , but it 's a start . 
  yeah , well . . 
  i do n't think any answer to that question matters at all . 
  roughly , silly face ( as far as i understand ) . 
  neues deutschland headlines \\ ^ \\ ^ history lessons and the little my father told about business trips . 
  ( at east german times , neues deutschland was a close-to-the-party newspaper . 
  not that i read it without being forced to ... ) -- edit : for the origin of the question : i can see where she 's coming from . 
  soviet union was a centrally governed union of `` kind-of '' independent states ( * sowjetrepubliken * ) . 
  and it 's big . 
  which is where the fruitful comparisons end . 
  `` conchita '' , diminutive of `` la concha '' , the clam , includes the , ahem , genital meanings in at least many spanish-speaking regions . 
  so , `` clam sausage '' . 
  very fitting . 
   you were the one who was disrespectful from the beginning , t where ? 
  please show me . 
  no , i 'm a drunk dog , not a donkey . 
  if you miss respect for your opinion in my reply , i am sorry . 
  you did n't seem to be interested in an actual discussion . 
  a lot of misinformation , too - and that 's not even the point . 
  but hey , you called bullshit , so i must be wrong . 
   things like these are the reason why ~ ~ some things should not be decided by a referendum . ~ ~ democracy requres educated and informed people . 
  please . 
  right now , we are only a little artistic liberty away from having the relevant information at the bottom of a locked cabinet in a dark basement with broken stairs , and a helpful `` beware the leopard '' sign . 
  if you want millions of people to change , complaining about them wo n't do . 
  german here - looks quite familiar , especially the camping pic, 
  coming from eastern germany : it 's not just the big-or-not , it does n't matter most of the time . 
  some people , when sitting down with their family for a meal , say `` enjoy your meal '' , others say grace .
