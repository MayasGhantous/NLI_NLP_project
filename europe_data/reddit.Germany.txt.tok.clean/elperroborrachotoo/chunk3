  for some , living with their knowledge is more suffering than they deserve . 
  yet i am not their judge , and i would consider myself fully responsible for the results of any ( non - ) exposure . 
  not a burden i want to carry . 
  [ edit ] as for my closest circle , i never got into any situation . 
  i 've lost contactr with many - where knowledge would n't change anything . 
  there are some that are still close : it would certainly destroy what kept us together . 
   who knows why they did what but we do know many cases - and often , it 's a decision i would n't demand anyone to choose against . 
  faced with the option to either vanish in the local guantanamo , or signing a paper that you will `` help the country to protect it against its enemies '' , it 's not really much to ask , you are n't a terrorist , are you ? 
  you just go on like you always did , an that music circle you go to every thursday , you just write a little report of what you did . 
  your wife loves her job , but of course , if we have to question your loyalty , she ca n't work in that position anymore . 
  but in our contry , there 's a job for everyone . 
  * there 's no need to mention working with boiling hot lye and little to no protection 8 hours a day in an airless hellhole , you know already . 
  * your son wants to study chemistry ? 
  see , the country does n't need any more chemists right now , but lathe operators . 
  of course we could make an exception for him . 
  is it to much to ask for a little in return ? 
  the cases are `` old '' , and for the majority , life went on . 
  which is an excellent time to look at the underlying mechanisms and results how it could happen , continue to happen , and how it affected society . 
  if the film is any good , it shows that becoming a stasi spy is n't a black-and-white affair . 
  it 's not `` the evil stasi spies '' against `` ordinary people '' . 
  the things that turned people into spies were manyfold and complex . 
  it is a result of social conditions more than individual choices . 
  we wish you would n't have to learn that the hard way . 
  * hug *  i think this is the largely a byproduct of the average us citizen being isolated from the rest of the world . 
  this might be a factor . 
  otoh seeing that our two highest officials , who both grew up in east germany , one of them having been tasked with public processing of stasi history , turn a very dim eye to the us spying and a very inquisitive towards snowden , seeing that many people who grew up in east germany react with `` not my problem , i have nothing to hide '' , i would give you guys the benefit of doubt . 
   just like everyone else ... who is doing poorly right now ... so not really a good idea . 
  yeah , i got that . 
  what i do n't understand is why this would n't devalue the dmark quickly , i.e. 
  why it would * remain * strong . 
  --  do n't take this crap too seriously well - i feel like i 'm told not to work so hard for the betterment of everyone , which makes me feel like being stuck in a weirdo atlas shrugged universe . 
  with me on the randian side , which creeps me out to no amount describable . 
   ride it out better i still remember a decade ago when the economists giggled at german stubborness to stick with production ( of goods !, 
  in the middle of europe !, 
  in a high wage country ! ), 
  instead of seeing the future and start betting double default credit mobile tendon swaps . 
  my question is : how would the dmark continue to soar with a huge amount of inflation and the export-centric economy losing its `` monopolist position '' ? 
  how would the mark remain strong while the economic model `` goes to the shitter '' ? 
  thanks for your but my digestion is fine , thank you !, 
  whatever you it 's either this or one of [ yurigol ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1pl53r/german_lawmakers_say_they_will_give_edward/cd3lqt9 ) 's suggestions . 
  but it 's still . 
   or yes ^ \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  oh , ok . and here i just my country grew a pair of balls . 
  it might be not exactly that , though : it is `` not exactly implausible '' that german agencies are n't any better at least locally , that german agencies have helped and are helping the us agencies gather information here , and the merkel doesn #t have much maneuverability here . 
  in favor of this crazy crackpot conspiracy theory i would point to the ccc report about reverse engineering the * bundestrojaner * . 
  not only does it blatantly ignore requirements set by the constitutional court , the process - as described - is set up with basically zero efecdctive control . 
  or gift another one , the `` statue of fear '' . 
   global weirding pckmsc, 
  safe from what ? 
  when i say `` make them '' , i mean us a society . 
  when they say they `` want to '' stock shelves in a neon-lit underground bunker , it 's usually an very indirect goal , a response to economic and social pressure put on them . 
  for people working shifts ( as i have done myself many years ago ) , besides the social and health implications , there 's one thing sticking out : you have little to no say in the shift schedule . 
  management put one out that 's legal , if there 's something you do n't like or ca n't do , find someone to switch with you , or pack your staff and begone , there 's always a bunch of students and between-careerers to fill in . 
  to use your image : the manager wo n't go around every day asking people who would like the graveyard shift tonight , and close down the store when the default owl says `` not tonight , i have a date '' . 
  --  it 's better to let the people decide for themselves what schedule is better suited to their life style . 
  just because it has an `` either-or '' , it 's not a free choice about their life style . 
  just because people need a job for various purposes does n't mean every job is good for them - or us . 
  just because some people work shifts does n't mean everyone has to . 
   well that 's something [ businesses ] can calculate for themselves if one starts to - because they are at a great location and large enough for a sufficient pool of staff - the smaller one down the street will have the free choice to either do likewise or shut his store down . 
  saying `` let them decide for themselves '' is closing your eyes from the reality of choices they actually have , it 's rejecting the reponsibility for the results of our policies , it 's `` do n't bother me with details , if it does n't work for them , it 's their fault . '', 
  why do '' * most major * grocery retailers * need * to '' , just because '' * not everyone * gets out of work before 8 '' ? 
  no , seriously , why ? 
   i hope you realize that some people would love to work these hours so that they can have a job or earn some more money . 
  i do , but that 's not enough reason for me making them to . 
  i am certain they would prefer to work reasonable hours . 
  i 've seen the zombie shift workers in countries where this is a thing , and lately , that staff more and more looks undead throughout the day . 
  there are very few people who i 'd want to punish with such a schedule , and i would n't want to buy my groceries from them . 
  economically : do you think if opening time is e.g. 
  doubled from 12 to 24h , revenue or profits will increase with the additional labor cost ? 
  if not , what does that mean for prices , wages and employees ? 
  are you joking ? 
  no , i was asking `` what for ? '', 
  i am not saying there are no uses , and i do udnerstand that applications often follow technology . 
  otoh , i can use steam , watch tv online and play online games with less than that . 
  so ... 50mbit `` peaks '' for 3 minutes x 3 times per day x 30 days / month ~ 5h/month should be sufficient . 
  all night public transport is a local issue , e.g. 
  dresden has it . 
  most foreign ^ \\* guests ca n't understand why there is n't free wifi in a newly built the hotel !, 
  50mbit ... well , what for ? 
  ( serious question ) . 
  ( \\* for perspective , asking recent chinese guests what they notice most : the people are friendly . 
  there are not so many . 
  the air is clean . ), 
  shopping hours : i 'm ok with how it is . 
  yes , it takes some planning . 
  no , i do n't want people to work night shifts or sundays just because i ca n't be bothered to go shopping earlier . 
  retail is cut throat enough already in germany . 
  ( for ermergencies , i have 3 * sp\u00e4tshops * within 10 minutes distance . 
  ymmv ), 
  did you know he was also a literary critic , did you know ? 
   and then people wonder why do they want the independence ? 
  independence wo n't stop violent idiocy . 
  if you could just stand upright , black on top , red on bottom , yellow straight , and not loll around sideways af if there was nothing to do !, 
  i 'm not your typical german , i guess . 
  * hug * i just like your optimistic look at the world , little cubed warrior !, 
  it 's less than a dozen steps the other direction into winter again . 
  i know , and i was n't . 
  questioning whether the us is a fascitoid state is smart . 
  equating fascism with hitler is dumb . 
   us = literally hitler .
