  yeah , if you would kindly read the text beside the picture when you come by your history book again , that would be great . 
  we do have the same problem as the us : you ca n't have your secret service `` spy in the open '' , yet you need to exercise democratic control . 
  ( there were some recent scandals highlighing yet again that a secret organization tends to expand their authority in secret . ), 
  that 's an effective argument against hypocrisy : germany is n't a single entity . 
  -- however , there 's another issue that 's structurally very problematic : a country 's laws tend to protect only the citizens of that country . 
  however , secret services spying on other countries and exchanging that information effectively evades any country-local control . 
  even if you ca n't stop the burglar you do n't have to hold the door for him . 
  i 'd be feckin ' proud of my country if he ended up in germany . 
  however , there are so many big powers stirring that pot i could n't wholeheartedly recommend it . 
  [ edit ] ... aaaaaaand it 's gone !, 
  so you want police not to respond to call from private businesses , courts not to bother with your complaints about a supplier cheating you , move private businesses away from public infrastructure , and deal yourself with the leather tanning shop opening right beside your outdoor cafe ? 
  violating their god-given right to lie to me . 
  this feels like it should be a page 5 `` did you know '' item rather than a headline . 
  still i wo n't complain about what 's probably good news . 
   there are certainly ways in which massive new construction in london could diminish this demand ; if the city tore down all its most beautiful streets and buildings and replaced them with charmless new construction , that would hurt the appetite for the city a bit ( though less than one might imagine , as people are paying for much more than pretty buildilngs ) . 
  but they are paying for what the pretty buildings do to other people , because that 's a big part what makes london london . 
   if the city did n't update infrastructure to accommodate a building boom , congestion costs would rise to choke off demand . 
  now that 's the city i want to live in . 
  updating the infrastructure would n't help anything if it 's the first limit : the city would grow to the choking point until another `` stopping condition '' is hit . 
  such as infrastructure overdone . 
   but one could free building rules dramatically ( lowering the shadow tax rate ) and raise actual property taxes to help fund new infrastructure , and still have everyone come out ahead . 
  while that would certainly be more straightforward , i do n't see how this changes things ( unless i misunderstand what he means with the `` shadow tax '' ) . 
  [ ah well ] ( http://www.google.de/search?q=brot&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;hl=de&amp;tbm=isch&amp; ), 
  can we compromise on `` money helps , but is n't help '' ? 
  the 1970 ' small town economy is far from the economic reality faced by the majority of citizens nowadays . 
  but in no way i want to shred the canadian example for its obvious deficiencies - i 'm far to happy that it 's been done at all . 
  however , i 'd be careful with extrapolating conclusions . 
  generally - as it came up in another sub thread - i 'd experiment with base services rather than base income . 
  it 's not any easier , but it forces you to face the real problems . 
   i 'm not sure what you suggest . 
  maybe s/he is n't suggesting as much as pointing out a problem ? 
  if you are looking for ideas , the core is : * money is n't help * you have to look beyond the current economic model , stop seeing it as inevitable or god-given . 
  why do you * need to buy * food , rent and utilities ? 
  corporations have a good model to shed social , responsibility : we are only doing what the market demands , if we do n't someone else would , we are only responsible to out stockholders , etc. 
  government handing out money to fix problems is kind of denial of responsibility as well . 
  but somehow it 's still the responsibility fo consumers and welfare recipients to make things right . 
  if the system as a whole is n't working out for so many , we have to accept it 's a systemic rather than an individual problem . 
  -- i would , well , toy around with providing * unconditional base services * , rather than base income income : free public health care , public transport , public ( higher ) education etc. 
  it is problematic to keep these services functional , draw limits what to do and what not ( free homes ? 
  food ? 
  ) , and adopt to social and technological changes . 
   money is n't help +1, 
  while i love the idea of an unconditional basic income , i see practical problems . 
  mainly , cost for private sector goods - especially unforgoable regular cost like rent , water , electricity - will rise to largely capture surplus , not reducing the working week . 
  secondary , subsidies , while we can all agree they are allocated wrongly , are one of the few regulatory mechanisms a government has in a market-oriented society . 
  it takes a lot of trust in economic fairytales to imagine a society running without it . 
  i love the experimenting with the idea , even if it 's only to slaughter some holy cows of the western world , but i do n't see it 's practical . 
  makes me imemdiately think of [ lise ] ( http://workingtropes.lmc.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/the_winter_market ), 
  `` made in germany '' was originally introduced by the poms , to label cheap imports ... 
   the dublin iii that germany independently halted ? 
  ... i.e. 
  processing syrian refugees themselves , instead of sending them back to the country that would be responsible for processing them ? 
  i do n't hear anyone complaining about germany stealing refugees from them . 
  i 'm not sure about the legal position , but the intent of dublin-iii was to shield germany from the majority of refugees . 
  ( now * that * was a shitty move , sure . ), 
  plus , `` independently '' ? 
  as if all other countries would have followed dublin-iii by the t. 
  * however * , as eu members they are bound by various guidelines and agreements , such as dublin iii , freedom of movement applying not only to eu citizens , and 2011/95/eu `` qualification guidelines '' and more . 
  so while , yes , they have not agreed to quotas yet does n't mean they can do whatever the fuck they want , close their borders and hey , suckers , deal with it . 
  what 's wrong with  it 's time to confront extremism head on . 
  oh yes , indeed !, 
  i often ca n't tell apart sarcasm and confidence either . 
  to be fair , the situation is pushing limits , it has a lot of triggers , and the subreddit apparently has become a target for people who ... usually do n't hang out here , if you take my meaning . 
  [ might be a tl ; dr ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f8nh2fpjst8lr5-ieupkyoy7zjc6tvcnhsm78ea95i3m2f27zby4ux0cg40du_o9dqhiesm2k9hncwonr5ucxg3z2mvw4oqjzplp5n8edrqua1ndpig6telrnakr5hwpym_y3urs ), 
  would `` infused by cheap stereotypes '' considered wrong ? 
  he 's brown . 
  how much more evidence do you need ? 
  maybe that 's because women and children are still less likely to be drafted for military service . 
  naah , must be something more sinister . 
   welfare terrorists please , when you really have to do it , do it right . 
  how do you want to stir up fear and hate with `` tourists '' ? 
  . . or by plane , or by boat or by any means of transportation with territorial independence . 
  bit yes , technically you are absolutely correct  it 's just that the right to apply for asylum in europe goes much deeper than dublin ii . 
  in a sense , it 's just a procedural agreement how to implement the more fundamental right . 
  ( e.g. 
  if it was found that dublin ii was invalid , the right to apply for asylum would still stand . ), 
   but really , the way germans react nowadays can indeed be called nothing else but a guilt trip this is a pretty questionable generalization : germany itself is torn between extremes as much as the rest of europe . 
  what we see , however , is that the side which you call `` guilt trip '' currently has an advantage . 
  and that 's good . 
  because what you call guilt trip , i call : the [ axelrod initializer ] ( http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/axelrod.html ) , innocent until proven guilty , good until proven bad . 
  standing up for one 's ideals even when it 's * hard * . 
  refusing to join the * `` hey , yes , technically you have the right to apply for asylum , but , ahem , today it 's really . . umm ... inconvenient , you understand ? 
  '' * game . 
  the * `` do n't you dare to exercise a right '' * game . 
  certainly , guilt plays a role . 
  but it should be considered tha `` nazi guilt '' , as / u/imzephyr so eloquently puts it , plays a minor role here : showing the world that the new germany is more than just heidenau and pegida certainly drives more . 
   while neglecting to think of long term effects or taking action against the root cause of the mass influx of refugees/migrants . 
  you ca n't play one for the other . 
  you need to treat the root cause and the symptoms . 
   altruism ? 
  not really : people want to show off how good they are in order to get social approval it 's amazing how your gaze can penetrate the skulls of 80 million people . 
  over the years , i 've seen a lot of mental acrobatics showing without a doubt that any altruistic , compassionate or selfless action is so only superficially , and deeply rooted in selfishness . 
  that 's a pretty popular sport with aynrandists and free market fundamentalists . 
  this tells me more about the one making the claim than people in general . 
  nowithstanding glee 's statement being laughable , i , too , take it as a compliment . 
  `` germany the hippie state '' . 
  that 's so freaking sweet !, 
  no , it 's called `` not being too much of an asshole '' . 
  oh yeah , going to denmark is , like , really hard !, 
   however , there should be a strong , loud no to this .
