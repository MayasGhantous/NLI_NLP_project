  1 . why ? 
  2 . how ? 
  agreed , but  `` we do n't want food , we want to go on '' is setting priorities . 
   we really need to do something to counter the unrealistic expectations these people have about europe and its asylum system . 
  such as applying the laws for asylum ? 
   if you want asylum in a safe country you should be happy with what you 've got , even a wooden shack in rural poland with a school nearby is 100x better than living in a refugee camp in turkey . 
  life in * any * refugee camp will - for most - be significantly worse from their life before they had to flee . 
  their level of reference is * not * the turkish refugee camp , * not * the bombed-and-burned home . 
  for most , it is a rather modern and stable life . 
  and what 's wrong with them trying to make the best of it ? 
  the problem is * not * refugees daring to voice their expectations , hopes and dreams . 
  they were peacefully protesting , what more can you want ? 
  they are still people , not cattle . 
  i am certain for most of them life in a refugee camp - no matter the country - is worse than the life that was suddenly taken from them . 
  their frame of reference is * not * a war-torn shithole . 
  it 's having a home , a family , a plan for their life that was at least somehwat on track . 
  imagine being thrown out of your current life , ending up in a tent camp , the ground turning to mud with the more frequent rain , barely enough toilets and irregularities in food supply . 
  like that last day on the open air festival . 
  only there 's no car , no hot shower , little to no room to shut out the world . 
  would you not try to go for something better ? 
  our own home - and jobless would be chastized for being too dumb and lazy to go the last mile . 
  rivers of milk and honey ^ 1 are waiting for you , why do you have to sit back and do nothing ? 
  sticking to it , not giving up , beating all odds * and * going for the princess are the things we ostensibly value in our society . 
  no , germany ca n't take them all . 
  but i ca n't find any blame in myself for anyone trying . 
  -- ^ 1 of course , typical exaggeration . 
  our rivers consist of milk * or * honey , you keep them separate and orderly : milk downhill , honey uphill . 
   hungary is actually pretty nice . 
  absolutely , as far as i know !, 
  :-) but refuguess certainly heard more of germany than hungary . 
  my niece moved to france some years ago and it is n't obvious she 's from germany anymore . 
  so when some co-workers found out : * `` oh , you are from germany ? 
  your family must be very rich , then !, 
  '' * which is n't exactly true , but shows . 
  yes . 
  though surprisingly hungary does n't want to process them all , and not all of them want to stay un hungary . 
  i 'm shocked , shocked , shocked . 
  yeah , it 's problematic for various reasons . 
  one is germany 's interest to shield themselves - we 'd have to process only those that arrive by plane or by ship via the north / baltic sea . 
  this would create a very problematic distribution . 
  another is eugh declaring the accomodations for asylum seekers in greece a violation of human rights . 
  oh yeah , and then there are refugees actually daring to have preferences . 
  you make it sound like they can pick . 
  legally ^ ^ * they can not . 
  roughly , the procedure for granting asylum rights must be done by the country that has `` induced or not prevented '' entry into the eu . 
  and you can not blame them for * trying * to get to their preferred country . ^ ^ * ^ \\* edit, 
  i have been to new york a few times ( 3 or 4 ) . 
  would n't want to live there . 
  a town that would grind me up or turn me into an asshole . 
  dear anoneuropoor , i am displeased by having to inform you that despite growing up in a socialist country and despite my strong - almost primal - rejection of a restrictive society , i observe that i am growing more and more communist . 
  i am convinced this world should be ashamed of turning me into a communist , but that 's my personal and ultimately inconsequential opinion . 
  having said that - mostly as a fair warning - here i am . 
  as moderate as i can muster . 
  best regards , a drunk dog on the internet . 
  having more than the other guy is the other half , then ? 
   being required to exchange 25brd marks for 25ddr marks , well yeah , there was that , too ... a very late but still heartfelt `` thank you '' for helping bring the taste of watermelons to my younger self !, 
  you mean [ mark der deutschen demokratischen republik ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mark_%28ddr%29#/media/file:1_mark_ddr_wertseite.jpg ) ? 
  just kidding . 
  on vacation , i always enjoyed the different currencies . 
  of course it 's more complicated , but it also added some exoticness to travel , something that was uniquely associated with that country . 
  in a way , a lovely impracticality . 
  i have the feeling you would welcome the method if the results for germany and czech republic would be reversed . 
  let 's just call it `` even '' . 
  no , not shirley , amelia !, 
  plus , permanent statues of still-living persons are particualry risky . 
  and yet readigng that they are temporary only was a letdown . 
  trying to be positive : it 's an example for america being very accomodating to the stupid . 
  ( are n't we all - some of the time ? ), 
  i am truly and simply not in the position to say whether that 's right or wrong . 
  yet i 'm sure i do not want this hypothesis to be tested . 
  lets put that differently : those closer to russia want to fight . 
  those closer to germany , though ... 
  this is the armchair supremacy section !, 
  facts are that way !, 
  however , it is dumb , arrogant and/or intellectually lazy to equate a visit to mcdonalds with a fundamental flaw or failure of the person in the picture , their goals or desires or their movement . 
  oh how i wish i sounded like werner herzog when i speak english !, 
  oh and here i thought the standard response would be `` more surveillance , less civil rights , more power to the powerful '' . 
  how wrong i was !, 
  the tempest never forget !, 
   even though he probably would go to austria , aka lying . 
  how do you think he should have stated that he accepts the restriction without triggering your lie detector ? 
   what the hell is wrong with you ? 
   and why my parents always wanted to go there , in spite of the chilly summers . 
  your parents liked to ... chill ? 
  i 'd love to see this tried in european capitals , i 'd even be willing to do that - if it was n't for the mankini . 
  that 's my point : `` asked to leave '' is different from being arrested . 
  i 'm against it because anyone who thinks or has to wear a niquab or burka for whatever reason is practically excluded from public life . 
  it 's harming helping the woman yearning for liberation from her tyrannical husband . 
  it 's de-integrating the woman that choses to wear . 
   you ca n't wear an mankini in most cities in europe for instance , you 'd be arrested ** ^ ^ [ citation ^ ^ needed ] ** i 'd expect that you might be asked to leave a private property or certain area , and forcibly so if you resist . 
  arrested ? 
  rather unlikely . 
   you ca n't wear a nazi uniform in some countries e.g. 
  in germany , but there are very strict `` legal walls '' to prevent this from being extended to more . 
  yea , we should totall make stuff explode . 
  thanks !, 
  did i just * whoosh * or did you reply to the wrong comment ? 
  consider yourself honorary europeans . 
  not anymore . 
  your know your sister has to stay at home when tourists are around .
