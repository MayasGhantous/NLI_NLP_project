  can i also upvote you for explaining this purpose ? 
   bail out banks [ ... ] most of which has now been paid back unrelated to the topic , but wut ? 
   the government gets its mandate from the public . 
  [ ... ] of course . 
  this does not mean , however , that the public participates in each and every decision ( with good reason at least in theory ) . 
   nobody recently elected a government with a manifesto promise of inviting thousands of illegal migrants into the country . 
  otoh , only a minority elected parties campainging for closing borders and restricting immigration . 
  few if any campaigned on actually * revoking the right to apply for political asylum * . 
  ahem . 
  applying for asylum is legal for everyone . 
  for those who are already here illegally , * it is already illegal * . 
  if we fail to apply the respective laws , it 's hardly the immigrants fault . 
   what orban is saying is that the eu member state 's decisions on the migrant crisis does not have the backing of the general public of the eu of ** large parts ** of the general public . 
  and important distinction imo . 
  he 's also suggesting that how to deal with the influx should require * specific * authorization from the public , which is questionable at best - how questionable varies between countries . 
  huge parts of the `` crisis '' is europe not being able to find common ground . 
  that 's not the fault of refugees , to be clear . 
  the process is n't unregulated , but europe largely fails to exercise the amount of * control * desired by ... some people . 
  hardly the refugee 's fault , either . 
  --  what does snow have to do with it ? 
  just an single simple example that `` the public '' can withstand a lot more of `` chaos '' and `` uncontrolled and unregulated processes '' than not only orban suggests . 
  fwiw , the government controls the weather as much as it controls the flow of refugees . 
  it 's certainly not that people are coming here because suddenly europe has become much to cozy . 
  & nbsp ; of course europe 's governments need to `` sort out '' immigration , and there will be significant changes in the following years . 
  of course , the flow does shake the foundations of europe ( more than many of arguably worse crises before ) . 
  but i ca n't see much more than orban drumming his own right-wing drum . 
  `` fear the dark man '' seems to be quite popular with him for a long time . 
   * you are running out of accommodation for migrants and you do not have the resources to teach the new arrivals german or spend money on other programs to integrate them into wider society . 
  it 's a recipe for disaster . 
  * is just fear-mongering . 
  yes , ressources are strained , but there is still capacity . 
  we have until now not allocated the resources , but they are there . 
  `` recipe for disatser '' us just utter bullshit . 
  get a grip , man/woman . 
  the sky has been falling for thousands of years , and is still up there . 
  ** tl ; dr : half-truths and strawmen . 
  ** most government actions are n't authorized directly - but in the same sense government did n't get `` authorization from citizens '' to stuff billions into bank pockets . 
  as for the `` chaotic '' part - every year , the first snow on the streets creates more chaos for millions of people relying on public transport than millions of refugees . 
  from what i see and what i hear , day-to-day life is pretty normal for the vast majority of people here . 
  the brunt of the chaos is taken by volunteers . 
  even the professionals involved , while pretty stretched , are n't dropping left and right . 
  i make it a point to ask them about their workload ( not too many , admittedly ) , and i was pretty surprised by the `` it 's busy , but not overly so '' attitude being prevalent . 
  the only chaos affecting many is the topic itself : it has created deep trenches across families and friends . 
  well . 
  i guess that 's somethign we can deal with . 
  unregulated : not exactly , existing regulations are n't applied . 
  an hungary had its part in that . 
  you mean `` troublemakers '' like people burning down asylum homes , insulting foreign tourists on open street ? 
  people who use soccer matches as a cheap excuse for mindless violence ? 
  people who buy apartment buildings to triple the rent ? 
  yeah !, 
  question is : who will take them ? 
   but once they 're free to live in our society it 'll magically work out somehow ? 
  of course not - because the normal living conditions in europe are comparable to that of an emergency refugee shelter . 
  i am living in the same country as thilo sarrazin and josef ackermann and joachim gauck and lutz bachmann . 
  surprisingly little facepunching going on for that . 
  this could be said about every functional prototype . 
  whether this solution can be improved to scale well reamins to be seen - for the moment i 'm happy to see more experiments tackling the storage problem . 
  it 's a good thing , because she rather wants to be sexed by you than someone who can get it up . 
  good answer - probably , i do n't know but i thought that this might be indeed a question that requires some history knowledge to answer . 
  why is n't it part of one of the surrounding countries , was n't annexed in one of the wars , etc. 
  well , now tell me , why * is * belgium a country ? 
  east germany was like poland - abortions quick and easy to get . 
  yes would mean , * `` yes , it 's a strong desire of mine to be on the ballot and be elected by the people !, 
  '' * it could also mean `` yes , whatever that means . 
  have fun , guys . '', 
  yes !, 
  because ... well , because ? 
  we all do bad things every day . 
  does n't mean we * are * bad . 
  life is n't that simple . 
  never . 
  i will separate * doing bad * from * being bad * , too - as long as my mind is strong . 
  maybe there are different brits people . 
  i thought they were all !!! 111 !!!, 
  converting to christianity to improve their chance of asylum . 
  that comment is n't the spawn of understanding either . 
  according to you , judging the room i 'm in now i could `` easily say '' the population is 100 % male and would n't be `` much wrong '' . 
  but i would . 
  calm down , have a coffee . 
  urrrgh . 
   irish car bomb that 's some weird drink , right ? 
  right ? 
  heck , i am german and could fly off the handle right now, 
  `` merkel did nothing wrong '', 
  your ocean is running out to the left !, 
  but yeah , wild place . 
  checkout `` mid summer night tango '' : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qauzo-rrc0g, 
  that 's how bad it is !, 
  two weeks in summer , when there 's not to much hail . 
  now kiss !, 
  ^ [ edit ] ^ ( if there 's trouble because of the brokiss , there 's always asylium in germany . 
  right ? 
  right ? ), 
  he forgot ~ ~ poland ~ ~ ~ ~ that other poland ~ ~ romania !, 
  that circle on the bottom left is weird . 
  ... i.e. 
  the position of the new polish government regarding legal abortions . 
  whoa !, 
  i am certain this is how polish words are born .
