what are we doing ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  `` it 's simple : if we all act like assholes other assholes wo n't visit out city . 
  little do they know that we are just acting . 
  `` shut up , else ikke will come over , asshole '' got ta love berliners . 
   i think most of them want to be part of something rebellious . 
  that 's how you do rebellions . 
  and that 's why many rebellions fail after everyone calms down and asks what they actually want to do . 
  the only consensus is that what they have now is bad . 
  and i totally agree with them . 
  would a born german who became a dutch citizen be a possible king , too ? 
  usually i would make a joke about speeding up the process to make me the king of the netherlands , but i guess at this point in time three different anti-terror team would raid my ass then . 
  so , no joke for you !, 
   germans have a notoriously bad reputation in austria [ ... ]  austrians watch german tv all the time that explains everything . 
  the iers [ principles ] ( http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/about/ ) say everything . 
  why does a research institute need any principles other than working according to research ethics ? 
  their principles scream `` free markets , no regulation , governments can fail too you know !, 
  for germany : the problem is n't the amount of money spend , but the return on investment . 
  we blow hideous amount of money for partially-functioning military hardware that is never delivered on time ( helicopters ( nh90 ) , fighterjets ( eurofigher ) , ships ( corvetts class `` braunschweig '' ) ) . 
  on the other hand we do n't have enough money left to buy spare parts for the working equipment/vehicles we already have . 
  the whole acquisition process in the ministry of defence is totally screwed and most likely corrupt . 
  we put our soldiers in danger because the politicians are willing to accept whatever the defence industry is selling them . 
  if a company can not deliver , you wo n't buy from them again . 
  the highly-qualified people working there can find jobs elsewhere in germany . 
  old , original berliners are often seen as unfriendly and poor . 
  new , hipster berliners start to complain about tourists and people who move to berlin as soon as they moved there to study social media pr bachelor of arts and drink coffee . 
  that is the stereotype . 
  every time i actually go there i meet nice people . 
  bristol is an awesome city , and you have bath nearby for some ancient roman stuff . 
  and not as expensive as london . 
  nobody want to legislate competition away . 
  we just want to soften the blow . 
  maybe , because the polish land was n't defended by polish soldiers ( or at least not officially ) but mainly by german soldiers . 
  you ca n't bribe the sea . 
  these children are 13 . 
  do you really think they are able to make an informed decision about life and death ? 
  they are manipulated by their environment . 
  if they ( hopefully ) return , they should be taken out of this environment by the authorities , get psychological treatment and hopefully become productive members of our society . 
  edit : and the people who manipulated them into going there should be punished of course . 
   ( the full version is the only one i accept as our anthem ) as long as you not only accept the borders mentioned in the full version as the borders of germany i have no problem with that . 
  a news break, 
  oh , thank you . 
  i changed it on my websites . 
   if you publish a few texts on a web page ... ... with a commercial interest . 
  so if you just write your private blog and do n't make any money with it , you do n't have to have an imprint . 
  as soon as you start including ads or a flattr-button on it i would advise to have an imprint . 
  see telemediengesetz [ \u00a7 5 ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__5.html ) ( german ) ^ i ^ am ^ not ^ a ^ laywer ^ and ^ this ^ is ^ no ^ legal ^ advise . 
  ^ i ^ am ^ also ^ not ^ a ^ firefighter ^ if ^ you ^ somehow ^ thought ^ that ^ so ^ i ^ can not ^ help ^ with ^ that ^ either . 
  ^ i ^ am ^ however ^ a ^ random ^ guy ^ on ^ the ^ internet . 
  thank you , that was close . 
  i almost started a world war because i thought \u7530\u820e\u8005 meant something meaner . 
  our history teacher played that in class once and i was sure that it was satirical ... 
  the gdr anthem is really nice though . 
  what i wanted to express with the comment was how quickly decisions to kill or save a person are made . 
  some ( mine ) simply based on two previous comments which are both from hearsay . 
  to make that clear i let the lyrical me write that he himself is an uninformed fuck . 
  tl ; dr : do n't worry , i wo n't try to save sepp blatter . 
  somebody needs to save sepp blatter . 
  some uninformed fucks are trying to kill him . 
  ^ i ^ am ^ an ^ uninformed ^ fuck ^ too . 
  i think you are mixing things up here . 
   watch?v = s-moy8vuebks it even sounds danish to me . 
  i think i just ordered milk . 
  that depends on how the level of sovereignty of the federal states is set . 
  look at colorado in the us smoking marijuana all day long while texas would probably go ape shit over this . 
  if we would have a government like the writers of the us constitution intended it ( securing borders , controlling the army , setting some general laws , nothing too specific ) it would not be that hard . 
  let 's talk again in 10 years about this , after the whole southern europe/northern europe `` who gets the monies '' - thing settled down a bit . 
  in the background there is the [ monument ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sevastopol#mediaviewer/file:2012-09-09_%d0%9f%d0%b0%d0%bc%d1%8f%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%ba_%d0%b7%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%bc_%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b1%d0%bb%d1%8f%d0%bc_%d0%b2_%d0%a1%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b5_%281%29.jpg ) for the scuttled ships of the crimean war , which stands in sevastopol . 
  so this would have to be pro-ukrainian activists staging a staged pro-russian demonstration in territory controlled by russia . 
  that stretches the theory a bit too far i think . 
  edit : / u/slezyr [ wrote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2d2e2f/crimea_sevastopol_russian_media_makes_reportage/cjljrrt ) already about the monument . 
  and for a short time i thought i could impress anyone with my geography skills ( aka reading the wikipedia article some time ago ) . 
  there is a saying : `` wer hat uns verraten ? 
  ( `` who did betray us ? 
  social democrats . '' ), 
  they do pretty much anything to be in the government . 
  i know us consumer protection can not cope with german/eu standards . 
  does anybody now how whether that is also true for canada ? 
   nsa is a surveillance agency . 
  it is their job to want to have all kinds of information . 
  it 's the job of the rest of the government to keep them in line with our values . 
  in a democracy , if you have ( private ) information about every citizen ( including your commanding politicians ) , you have control . 
  you do n't even have to give the information you have about an unpleasant politician to the public , it is enough to hint that someone could have some information about some politicians to keep them in order . 
  and , thanks to fox news and their counterpart msnbc even the smallest error of a politician of the opposing party while be a mayor issue on the networks . 
  ( same in germany , it is not specific ) ( and there is still a difference between targeted surveillance of suspected enemies and mass surveillance of every persons connected to the internet . 
  keep in mind that the german foreign intelligence service does the same thing and i am also against that , so this is not the usual my-country vs usa thing ) . 
   could you explain or link that negotiation ? 
  sounds interesting !, 
  i think it was fairly common that a lot of upper class german citizens did not want their cities to be further destroyed by combat on the ground . 
  so many cities tried to send committees to the incoming allied forces to negotiate a peaceful capitulation of the city . 
  the sad thing is , that many nazi officials , like my grand-grandfather was one , shot soldiers or citizens who wanted to surrender . 
  so it was quite dangerous for the people in the committees . 
  i only found a german source for the capitulation of my home town ( and region ) . 
  it says that the third canadian division sent their 7th , 8th and 9th division to conquer the city of aurich and use that as a bridgehead for the conquest of the war-important city of emden . 
  all that happened in the last week of the war in europe . 
  source : http://www.ostfriesischelandschaft.de/fileadmin/user_upload/bibliothek/ortschronisten/kriegsende_in_ostfriesland.pdf edit : of course also lower-class people wanted the war to end , but usually educated `` important '' people like doctors or teachers were sent . 
  damn , even my grandfather talks highly of the canadians , even though they put this father in jail ( who admittedly was pretty evil ) . 
  also , they negotiated that my home-town was freed without a street-to-street fight . 
  nice guys those canadians . 
   `` germany has never figured out whether it wants to be part of the west , '' says john kornblum , a former american ambassador to germany who is now a lawyer in berlin .
