  the meaning changed in later years . 
  you know what few people know , many germans are n't aware of its original meaning . 
  i agree , time for some anschluss . 
  that jokeis hard to get :p, 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg wiki tells me it 's the right one , though . 
   baden-w\u00fcrttemberg anything i 'm missing here ? 
  i think they 're not very well informed about german politics . 
  i like your hover text , 
  yikes , this is definitely not true . 
  in polisci the german system is called a * fluides 5-parteiensystem * ( fluid five party system ) , that 's the general view . 
  i think a dominating party would mean that they can form a government by themselves ( although i 'm not sure since this map is unsourced and not accurate ) so something the cdu is * currently * quite close to but was n't in the last 40 years and wo n't be in the near future . 
  it 's the first time since 1990 that there are 4 instead of 5 parties in parliament and i 'm sure that this will not be a thing that sticks around , on the contrary , i hope that there will be a 6th party in parliament soon . 
  [ all i can think of is ikea ] ( http://capdesign.idg.se/polopoly_fs/1.529800!imagemanager/1689849862.jpg ) , 
  surely worse than hitler . 
  no , that 's you guys . 
  fucking liberals , it 's especially them who use this term with a negative connotation . 
  well the muricans will still write 11.9.2013 , especially ridiculous when it 's at the end of a month , something like 11.27.2013 . 
  i hope you 're joking ... 
  welp , i think the standard for separatist movement is very low in this graph ... 
  same with bayern , it 's merely a joke i think . 
  is it like a car accident so that you just * ca n't * look away ? 
  * depending if you want one of * our * ( i.e. 
  * your german - euren ) or * his/her * ( i.e. 
  * one out of his personal six-pack * - deinen ) beers i 'm a native speaker but i do n't think i 'll be fluent in german anytime soon , too many rules . 
  but i hear finns are n't very different in that way , 
  i 'm sorry to hear that . 
  it sounds kind of dirty when you say ` ihre bieren ' . 
  do n't get me wrong , i like it , but it sounds like ` your meatballs ' . 
  : i love you , beeristheanswer , and not only because i 've got a hot swedisch teacher from finland but also because you 've got a great username . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how this is handled in germany but iiirc we pay for the fresh water and for the water that runs down the drain . 
  i just looked into how this is handled in my city but i do n't understand it , it seems to be progressive in price but 15 $ / m \u00b3 seems to be a little expensive . 
  in school we learned 5dm/m \u00b3 which * should * equal 2,5 $ / m \u00b3 , but maybe that was the price ten years ago for the fresh water only . 
  [ so my buddy went to this awesome place once ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9yz4jxv_53s/udmq6rehfri/aaaaaaaabuy/0br48suafu4/s1920/neil-armstrong.jpg ), 
  this used to be a regular thing in sarajevo , a few years ago . 
  time to break things up with the rogue states . . 
  not true , if he is granted * freies geleit * he would n't need to be extradicted . 
  http://www.dw.de/might-snowden-get-asylum-in-germany/a-17201788 i hope he gets it !, 
  definitely not after the guardian raids . 
  was trying to make a joke about the ~ ~ stereotype ~ ~ fact that germans do n't have humor . 
  if you click on the dot at the end of my sentence in my original comment you 'll see my intention ( :, 
  i 'm sorry , i ca n't laugh about such jokes [ . 
  oh my god i love the first one . 
  in germany only three articles ca n't be changed * at all * ( article 1 , 20 and 73 ( 3 ) ) . 
  article 2-19 are also under special protection , they ca n't be changed in their * wesensgehalt * ( = essence ) . 
  that 'd mean that you could change the wording and maybe add things but you ca n't change the initial meaning . 
  highly interesting in the third article , which grants equality for * everyone ( in paragraph 1 ) * between men and women ( in paragraph 2 ) if intersexual should be inlcuded one day it would be interesting to see wheter or not that would be a change to the * wesensgehalt * . 
  i 'd love that idea , although i really like our basic law and would n't know what i 'd change ( besides already proposed changes that 'll hopefully soon be implementes [ right for homosexuals to adopt ] and ` semantics like aknowleding that there are more than two genders ) . 
  i agree , it 's an example of bad propaganda . 
  but there is also very good and powerful propaganda that makes people do something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tokj6v0lxy ) , celebrating a death or rather a killing of someone who was n't really a threat any more and who 's killing did n't accomplish anything besides giving some people the feel of revenge . 
  the us is pretty prone to propaganda , hell they 've given up there civil rights and started wars because of it , what more could you dream of ? 
  he banned political parties ( communists and the social democrats ) , the opposition was allowed to vote . 
  haha, 
  wow , thanks for the link . 
  you know a lot about your constitution , 
  seems like the constitution is not really bad but just outdated ( in some ways ) . 
  sadly the founding fathers did n't seem to have any way to update it implemented . 
  it 's similar in germany , could n't someone simply sue the us for maybe an unfair voting system ? 
  i was n't arguing for a mis-interpretation of the constitution , i was thinking about a paragragh that granted a fair voting system , that may forbade something like gerrymandering . 
  the nsdap still got 43,9 % in the [ 1933 elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_march_1933 ) and there were two referendums that helped him rise to power : he did n't take over the power , the german people voted him into it : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_referendum,_1934 ( ca n't think of the other one , maybe someone can jump in . ), 
  we have two of these three things here too , 
  fuck , i do n't even know all the rules , i do n't know how people learn this language if it is n't their first language . 
  i 'm learning swedish right now and it just makes much more sense the way they do it . 
  look what you 've done , you made jamed the burrito cry . 
  you should be ashamed , both of you !, 
  as long as you ask `` was ist das ? '', 
  ( `` what is this '' , for people who do n't speak german ) often enough combined with pointing at things you should be able to learn the language pretty well  kidding aside , if i can help you in any way , you can pm me , i 'm also quite active in / r/lanl _ german , if you want to to study german ( :, 
  the ironic thing is that we have to thank you for many things in this system . 
  i definitely have to study the american system more closely , i hope i can do this further down the road . 
  well seeing that many americans think they are doing the countries they bomb a favor it really does n't suprise me that this congressman asked us to be thankful . 
  most americans are just deluded by their propaganda . 
  [ here 's a prime example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kc5xvr24aw ) [ this ] ( http://puu.sh/50cps.jpg ) was one of the questions that the interviewer , who spoke a whole of 5 words in a 30-minute ` interview , asked . 
  really pressing if you ask me ... 
  this is the really ridiculous thing about his statement , thanks for explaining it . 
  it was definitely clear were hitler was headed , the other nations did n't care and most germans supported him , it 's also a myth that hitler just seized power , there were two votes were germans gave him this power . 
  could the supreme court order something that would change the system ? 
  there has been a ` similar ' situation in germany , the * bundesverfassungsgericht * ( constitutional court ) ordered that [ overhang seats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overhang_seat ) were unconstitutional and that it had to be changed through legislation and it was done , although the two major parties profit from this . 
  one hell of a double standard , especially because it was n't even her ` business ' phone but the private one . 
  but aparently * muttis * privacy is worth more than mine ... 
  which is awesome if you travel with the wind . 
  so it 's the os you 're using ? 
  if so , what is it ? 
  i was talking about the v. 15 , i think , and i did n't find any settings for this , even through googling . 
  yay for being watched and controlled by the largest tracker in the world, 
  opera became worse than ( current ) ie with the last update , if you ask me . 
  you ca n't edit the start page , what is this bullshit ? 
  a better word would be * ranting * ( = st\u00e4nkern ) :p, 
  had and have the same problem with sync for many versions , i do n't know how a bug can remain such a long time , it 's sad . 
  do you mind sharing your ` setup ' ? 
  it started really early for me , my school used it as the default browser and that continued in my first uni . 
  my second one sadly uses ie as a standard but they always have ff installed on their machines . 
  it 's the by far best browser , imho . 
  * would be the correct translation for * now kiss !, 
  we do n't need more may-mays on reddit , we need less !, 
  a friend of mine studies * soziale arbeit * and i was in one of her lectures . 
  it covered child protective service and showed how long the process in these cases will go and how much paperwork and bureucratic work needs to be done . 
  sometimes it 's really sad that it is this way , they showed a short documentary and the sozialarbeiter told that she had multiple cases where she could n't reach out for the kid and it had severe consequences ( abuse and iirc even a death due to malnurition ) . 
  interesting but also depressing lecture . 
  wow thank 's for the link . 
  a rather extreme measure i have to admit . 
  ridiculous though that he stated that a school degree is pointless , try finding a job without any kind of education .
