  i can smell the freedum wou brought to this thread from here . 
  i hardly watch private television , mainly because it 's shit , but when i watch galileo once a month - you know to educate myself about water slides and large fast food portions - i instantly regret it because all you get is advertisements in disguise . 
  and even if i wanted to go to oktoberfest i would n't want reports on it for weeks prior to the event . 
  i made the mistake to watch private television ` news ' . 
   its like someone documenting a terrible disease outbreak move to germany and get three weeks of news coverage about what to wear on oktoberfest , 7 secrets about it , how it origined , useless facts about how many metres of sausage are eaten and how many swimming pools of beer . 
  it * is * a disease . 
  could you pin-point me to examples or anti-semitism ? 
  to be clear : critic on israel ! = anti-semitism , i hope you know that . 
  was that sarcasm or are you actually relieved/suprised that there is n't any anti-semitism in here ? 
  received it ( :, 
  when i see reports about the uprising in istanbul i get so carried away , it 's just beautiful to see people stand up for themselves . 
  those are the times that i really really want turkey to join the eu . 
  but i guess that there are many conservative areas in this huge country i sadly have n't visited yet , that would make the joining difficult , sadly . 
  and i think something like this should n't be rushed , i feel that this was a little bit rushed with romania and bulgaria , but i think that these issues will sort themselves out over time . 
  * wunderbar * would mean * wonderful *  you can send me your pm , i 'll try to not forget to do it this time around and i 'll usemy native language , * hessisch * :d, 
  man i definitely have to visit soon , what i see on documentaries is just stunning !, 
  this is still not america . 
  that you guys are very green-minded ( * umweltbewusst * ist gemeint ) , i think that 's really awesome !, 
  and if a german tells you that that has to mean something !, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ hope ^ ^ so ^ ^ at ^ ^ least . 
  i send you some support from here , 
  i often see no major difference between the policies of the cdu and those of the spd , they 're really close together right now . 
  a logic laugh is the best laugh !, 
  why do you guys get a 4 % treshold and we have to deal with 5 % ? 
  : / not that i 'd want the fdp or the afd in parliament , but i 'd definitely speak out for a lower treshold !, 
  no , i was wrong . 
  seems to be that it 's ` only ' ~ 60 % of their consumption that 's green : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=de&amp;pcode=t2020_31, 
  i tried , yes . 
  could n't grow one . 
  honestly ? 
  grow a pair , trees . 
  can someone explain me why they do n't have trees ? 
  [ here it is  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hso_nd41-6g ), 
   energy ( of which iceland , as only country in the world , produces only renewable . 
  i thought norway was powered entirely by hydro energy ? 
  ask him if he tried croissants . 
  they definitely apply , statistically/mathematically speaking . 
  but i get what you mean , just like any statistic is fuzzed when it 's a very small country . 
  that is just so nice , why ca n't more nations have such a friendly relationship ? 
  who wants to be my country buddy ? 
  i just wanted to state their policy on arms exports , i did n't vote for them and would see this too as a critical issue . 
  i 'm still against arms exports , i do n't want my country to profit thorugh blood money . 
  if you can assure me that these weapons will be stored in antactica for the case of a zombie apocalypse i 'm for it , in every other way : no thank you . 
  i agree , but since they usually agree with the spd it 's only rather symbolic . 
  i 'm honestly suprised that noone else came to this pun , bravo . 
  yes , but there was a bad experience with this in the largest german state * nrw * . 
  and i would n't know which delegates would be in for something like this , they would pretty much sell their whole party . 
  it provokes discussion , that 's dfinitely a nice thing . 
  and you can argue about this with pretty much every country , but i guess people misunderstood the question as something along the lines `` is germany already as worse as north korea or is it even worse ? '', 
  which they probably did n't want to imply . 
  it 's actually 0,5 % in federal and european parliament elections . 
  they 'll get 0,85 $ for the first 4 million votes and 0,70 $ for any further votes . 
  the pirates gained ~ 826.000 $ through this yesterday in the federal elections and ~ 50.000 $ in the state election in hessen . 
  for the first 4 million votes and 0,7 $ for any further votes . 
  the pirates gained 826.000 $ through this . 
  other germans in this thread will say i 'm insane but i think it 's the most likely turnout . 
  but a grand coalition is almost as likely , pretty difficult at the moment . 
  you 're ruining all the subtlety , silly bot . 
   and thanks to / u/heinz _ tomato_ketchup [ 1 ] [ ... ] do we have sponsored redditors already ? 
  ^ ^ this ^ ^ comment ^ ^ is ^ ^ brought ^ ^ to ^ ^ you ^ ^ by ^ ^ pepsi, 
  sure 'cause linke = sed * hurr durr *, 
  unless sexist assholes of course :p, 
  the defining moment that summarized her entire policy was when steinbr\u00fcck and merkel had the tv debate and in her final statement she ended with something like  and now i wish all ov the viewers a pleasant evening and a good night . 
  she just went full mutti and sent all viewers to bed where they shall remain without worries . 
  * let mummy do it * . 
  thing is that most germans ( and most people in general ) do n't know how to handle the eurocrisis either . 
  because it 's too fucking complex . 
  most people still think that we save the greek people , while we actually save greek banks , while we actually actually save german banks in greece , while we actually actually actually save our own fucking ass . 
  it 's depressing that people favor gridlock ( or the beautiful german word * stillstand * ) . 
   would n't it be better for world peace to stop producing high-tech killing machines [ ... ] ? 
  that 's one of the main positions of die linke , to be fair . 
  people will even doubt that . 
  it 's 0,85 for the first 4 million votes , 0,70 $ for any further votes . 
  the * piratenpartei * gained almost 1 million euro through yesterdays elections , that 's something . 
  sad thing is that it 's unlikely we 'll ever see such a change because the two big parties profit from it . 
  really interesting idea . 
  kind of , yes . 
  it 's ridiculous to see the photos of everyone on facebook . 
  they 're on basically every continent besides antarctica . 
  so you 're some kind of bird ? 
  glad you liked it , i love to joke about german stereotypes or even better about myself :d, 
  please contact your local authorities so that action can be taken immediately !, 
  hooooold on there cowboy ... do you honestly think such a change can happen from one day to another ? 
  it 'll have to pass multiple hearings and have you supplied all the necessarry forms that are needed for this change ? 
  and who 's going to pay for the new sign ? 
  surely not the city , that 's the business of the state . 
  did i mention that there is a 20 character limit for street names ? 
  it just does n't work this way , okay ? 
  no , i just meant that i had many encounters with people from the us that were n't in favor of limited speech . 
  i 'm aware that not everybody from the us is against this , just like not everybody in europe is in favor of it . 
  i see , i just wanted to clarify that you 're not being hypocritical on this issue . 
  so you are generally in favor of limitations on free speech , is that correct ? 
  that makes sense , but it * was * enforced , was n't it ? 
  funny that you 'll always hear many americans stand up for absolute free speech but when it goes against the us it 's suddenly hate speech . 
  i have to admit that i laughed as well when i imagined that . 
  this video does n't include the 5 % hurlde which will be veryimportant in this election . 
  great explanation of the rest though . 
  i 'd welcome it if you do n't use capital letters in your title the next time , no matter how arrousing the topic is . 
  this shall not become / r/politics . 
  okay , that 's right .
