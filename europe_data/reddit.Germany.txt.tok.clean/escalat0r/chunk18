  but if it 's not forbidden in the netherlands ( definitely not sure if it is or is n't ) there 's nothing you or me or anyone else could do about it . 
  what are they doing in this video that would justify to ` remove ' them ? 
  is playing football against any laws ? 
  or showing that flag , is that illegal in the netherlands ? 
  they may be morons but as long as they do n't do anything against the law why bother to even spend a thought about all this . 
  i was much more bothered with the intro ' of this video , they should get a few mre shoutouts in there , i only counted eleven . . 
  i was making a joke ... 
  that 's true , makes me wonder how she managed all this . 
  we were even told that we would n't be allowed to ride our bikes to school if we had n't a * fahrradf\u00fchrerschein * . 
  i was afraid man , afraid !, 
   but is it really so essential to make it compulsory ? 
  yes . 
  it 's an easy way to make sure fewer people drown . 
  why are you guys so upset about this , that 's 6 weeks in the life of a 8-10 year old , not a big deal ... 
  sometimes the american idea of ` freedom ' seems ridiculous to me . 
  yes , i like it that there is a punishment for holocaust deniers , it does n't violate my freedom of speech because that 's not a thing i feel the need to express ... 
  same here , just like people who ca n't ride bicycles . 
  when she was in 10th grade my sisters class wanted to make a bike trip as school trip , everyone was psyched and they had to cancel it because one girl could n't ride a bike . 
  who are these people and what did they do when they were little , we 're not even from an urban area ... 
  but many people wo n't learn it if neither their parents or school is making them learn it . 
  i 'm all open for students letting themself decide what they want to learn and what not but not when it comes to essential stuff . 
  teaching kids how to survive in water ... why is this so hard to understand ? 
  what do you mean by ` body image ' ? 
  ( i seriously have no clue ), 
  i do n't think it is really out in the open now . 
  sadly . 
  i whis more people had their comming out but we still have many homophobic fucks around us . 
  people with disabilities will definitely be able to not attend them . 
  although it 's often mandatory to still come and sit on the side ( broken arm for example ) i think it 's worth it even if only one in one hundret children is saved from drowning . 
  you 'll deal with it 6 weeks in your youth and will be done with it , why are we even discussing this ? 
  not enough information , they 're definitely ` murican . 
  it 's only teached so that people can survive in water . 
  and since many people wo n't learn it unless they learn it as a child ( out of shame mostly ) i think it 's a good thing . 
  but that might collide with the * freedum * thingy americans love so much . 
  are you under the assumption that homosexuality was n't around 30 years ago ? 
  i think it 's bullshit . 
  we 're so shy about sexuality , even in the oh so liberal european countries . 
  there is nothing wrong with it and it often annoys me that people treat it as something forbidden . 
  and i 'm not even a liberal hippie or something like that , i just think it 's ridiculous to treat sexuality the way many people treat it . 
  get over it . 
  that 's what was offered , she refused to do that . 
  i only learned about this here on reddit , that 's how little it affected me ( i.e. 
  i ca n't remember saying `` too bad that we ca n't go out tonight due to the tanzverbot '' ), 
  pm me your adress and i 'll send one too , 
  so expensive ... 
  i usually buy my groceries at lidl but when i shop at rewe i end up with the same stuff for much more . 
  usually around 20 $ and at lidl it 's often 10-12 $ . 
  even when i use * ja !, 
  * products . 
  and imho * ja !, 
  * products are behind the lidl groceries quality wise . 
  i agree . 
  makes me want to change my flair to this one , sadly it 's not available , do n't know why - fucking nazi mods !, 
  time for some * anschluss * !, 
  godwins law i guess , 
  i 'd take the second one , it reminds me of the nordic flags and i especially like norways and icelands flag , they look fantastic . 
  fitting to those countries , 
  i was joking , thanks for the link though , 
  harry potter or britain ? 
  in either way : very mysterious !, 
  whenever i read this or other * ministry of x * i have to think of the ministry of magic . 
  that 's why i ca n't take britain seriously . 
  david cameron is voldemort and maggy thatcher kills dumbledore . 
  gosh , that 's one ugly flag ... why not just use the current one and write `` fuck china '' on there ? 
  it 's still linked to the right scene and i do n't think this would be an option ( i know you were joking but as a german i have the * verpflichtung * to take jokes seriously ) . 
  if i could choose i 'd proably take the [ flag of hongkong ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/flag_of_hong_kong.svg/2000px-flag_of_hong_kong.svg.png ), 
  [ let 's go the whole hog . 
  ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_german_reich_%281935%e2%80%931945%29.svg ), 
  ah c'mon , you 're just a dutchfrenchluxembourgerish person that stole our flag !, 
  they spying is a terrible waste of tax payer dollars . 
  maybe this is what 'll eventually stop it , rather than privacy concerns . 
  and yet the cdu will ` win ' this election . 
  replies like this should be taken seriously . 
  i do n't see a joke there . 
  this is not funny . 
  [ you were lookig in the wrong places ... ] ( http://www.zoovienna.at/tiere/saeugetiere/koala/ ), 
  i think an asylum for a limited time may be a valid alternative but we really do n't know how long this conflict will exist . 
  maybe it 'll be 15 years , a time in which children are born and raised in the country of asylum . 
  it 's hard to force them out again when it 's become their home country . 
  maybe it 'll encourage others to follow swedens lead . 
  i hope germany will do so , we must help people who flee from such terror . 
  i think they raided this thread too , you have 14 downvotes but no replies . 
  really said , i like / r/europe and do n't want it to be influenced by this scum . 
  the page 404 's so i ca n't check but that 's likely to be the answer . 
  i 've also never heard of something like this ? 
  maybe they confused it with portrayal of the hakenkreuz and other nazi stuff ? 
  but that 'd be a huge difference . 
  i think many football players do n't even know their national anthems . 
  and sometimes the singers wo n't even know it : sarah connor ( german f celebrity ) once sang  br\u00fch ' im lichte dieses gl\u00fcckes ( * boil * in this blessing 's glory ) instead of  bl\u00fch ' im glanze dieses gl\u00fcckes ( flourish in this blessing 's glory ), 
  yeah i do n't take those polls seriously either . 
  i think some people just like to say that they * totally changed their mind * due to this debate . 
  according to the polls 10 % of the ~ 1100 people who were called changed their mind . 
  if it 'd be only 5 % that would be an enormous amount . 
  i 'm definitely looking forward for some suprises in this election . 
  how do you know that my granny does n't have nukes ? 
  sure , bring israel in this , we should totally listen to what they say . 
  new poll shows that my granny from jamaica is against any kind of intervention , equally relevant . 
  [ the only humane ` bombing ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade#the_start_of_the_berlin_airlift ), 
  the thing that disgusts me that every time the power of the us military comes up you guys state it with such a satisfaction that i imagine spit dropping from your mouth corner . 
  like it 's a good thing to have an overpowered war machine in your state .
