  i wish we 'd do this too . 
  the amis can suck it . 
  there is a similar rule in the elections of * schleswig-holstein * . 
  the party of the danish minority ( ssw ) is also excluded from the 5 % hurdle . 
  thanks . 
  i was being lazy , 
  i meant using it to have an advantage in a competition . 
  that 's most definitely true , it discredits you . 
  do you happen to have any source on that ? 
  ( i 'm not saying that i do n't believe you , i just like to read that ) . 
  maybe they argue that it 's some kind of fraud ? 
  but if somebody just uses it to run faster , let 's say just for themselves , i think you should n't be punished . 
  i think they 're not like you picture them right now . 
  they 're a populist party which voters consist of generally old people that get their news threw the bild zeitung ( german ` daily mail ' ) and are also infested by off-right folks . 
  i think it 's ironic that this attack achieved the opposite of its intention and only gave them more attention . 
  it 'll also most definitely not keep anyone who intended to vote for them from doing so . 
  they 'll likely see their positions as controversial , in a positive way . 
  * das muss man doch noch sagen d\u00fcrfen * for my german folks ( translates to : you * must * be able to say/state something like this ) . 
  i would n't call * being anti-gay * an opinion , it 's just a hateful and intolerant attitude . 
  well put . 
  i would 've argued that it 's the right thing to treat everyone equal , but your approach is much simpler . 
  i think it 's just one example . 
  there are also situations in germany that go against the rights of homosexual , i hope that we 'll soon have full equality for them . 
   because being `` non-gay '' is the normal thing to be . 
  that 's just not true . 
  there is no * normal * sexuality . 
  i would n't say that we have the best roads in europe . 
  i 'm not sure if i remember correct , but i always found the roads in france quite good . 
  that sound more than delicious . 
  i sadly do n't remember how it was in m\u00fcnchen , but iirc it was quite good or at least okay . 
  i think the most bike friendly cities in germany are m\u00fcnster and i think t\u00fcbingen . 
  bikes are n't allowed on * kraftfahrtstra\u00dfen * ( the actual term , * autobahn * was actually not influenced by hitler as i believed until now and how many germans will tell you , robert otzen was the one that called it this way ) . 
  that would be the classic autobahn but also * bundesstra\u00dfen * ( smaller highways , autobahnen are called a1 , a6 etc ; bundesstra\u00dfen will be b2 , b23 etc. ) . 
  so no , but that would be really difficult and i would n't know why anybody would ride a bike on an actual autobahn . 
  they 're allowed on every other street though and you can definitely get from point a to b with a bike but we 're lacking the amazing bike infrastructure the netherlands have . 
  that also includes places where you can lock or even store your bike hope that answers your question , 
  sometimes it 's that easy . 
  i wish we had more round prices or at least a five as last digit so we could get rid of the one and two cent coins . 
  i 'll try to refuse buying anything that ends with a nine ... and starve . 
  goodbye cruel heavy wallet world . 
  why are there prices like 1.22 $ in the supermarkets ( albert heijn to be specific ) . 
  in germany you 'll mostly have 1.29 $ , 1.35 $ or 4.99 $ but never such - to me - odd figures like 1 . * 22 * . 
  is it a tax thingy ? 
  i agree . 
  although it 's technically included i find it rude to not tip at all . 
   they were chocked when we told them that highways are free of charge in scandinavia though . 
  what ? 
  it 's the same in germany . 
  that 's ... right next to austria . 
  good for you i guess . 
  it was really weird to throw away plastic bottles that would be worth a few euros . 
  i 'm much more into vla than weed , but it 's good to have this right . 
  i 'll definitely give you django but i think the dubs in movies are often pretty decent . 
  but i wish i could watch ` this is the end ' in english tomorrow , i think it 'd be much better . 
  * sigh *, 
  the * komma * is n't neccessary  feel free to pay / r/lanl _ german a visit !, 
  quick correction/specification : pretty much everything you buy in bottles will have a deposit unless : * it is n't carbonated ( typically juices ) * it 's more than 3l ( you 'll sometimes find 3.01 l bottles in cheap stores for this purpose ) why ? 
  do n't ask . 
  it does n't make sense unless you argue that juices and large bottles are n't bought as much as water etc. . for everything else there are three different categories : - 0,08 $ - typically [ beer ] ( http://www.designnation.de/media/galerie/4ee2521fbee10,bierflasche.jpg ) ** unless ** it has such a [ cap ] ( http://www.flaschenland.de/images/product_images/info_images/500ml_braune_bierflasche_3500_2412_0.jpg ) then it 's : - 0,15 $ typically [ glas water bottles ] ( http://noerdlicher-bodensee.klimaktiv.de/media/09/30_symbole/10_bilder/glasflasche_wasser_q.wikipedia_rainer_zenz.jpg ) and also reusable plastic bottles ( the thicker ones ) - 0,25 $ everything disposable ; [ bottles ] ( http://files.homepagemodules.de/b39696/f101t1555p3073719n1.png ) or cans . 
  ___ as you see a bottle of beer can comefit in all three of the categories : [ 0,08 $ ] ( http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/digitalr/digitalr0908/digitalr090800156/5458794-leere-braun-bierflasche-isolated-on-white-background.jpg ) - [ 0,15 $ ] ( http://www.flaschenland.de/images/product_images/info_images/500ml_braune_bierflasche_3500_2412_0.jpg ) - [ 0,25 $ ] ( http://www.kkb-clan.de/images/forum-pics/bier/biersorten/zlatopramen_11/forum_2009_09_15_-_1.jpg ) - and as an special gift the lord gave us disposable glas bottles . 
  do you have this ? 
  when i visited a few weeks ago i never saw such a deposit system when i bought bottled drinks . 
  i 've watched an episode of dexter with german dubs - it 's horrible . 
  i wish more people would watch especially shows in ot . 
  that 's ze shpirit !, 
  i admire your bike-friendliness . 
  and this is n't only the case because the netherlands are so flat , there are many flat cities in germany that you are lightyears ahead of . 
  same with public transportation ( although i have n't used that much outside of amsterdam ) . 
  another thing i really like about the netherlands is your political system and the open-minded people . 
  that 's definitely much more worth than good recycling . 
  vla of course too . 
  prague  amsterdam , although both cities are quite nice . 
  they even mentioned the sommerloch in todays * heute * . 
  i found that quite funny . 
  do n't fool yourself , you 'll all be german * eventually * . 
  i was confused as well . 
  what 's prague for example if london is cheap ? 
  ah i see , thanks for the reply . 
  i hope you enjoy ( ed ) your stay in slovenia/germany . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  why do you have a slovenian flag , i thought you were an american ( visiting germany ) ? 
  the machines that handle the fruit or vegetable wo n't be able to support something like [ this ] ( https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3235/3131385339_79378d340a_o.jpg ) if they want to get clean slices . 
  i see . 
  still no reason to attack iraq then , we have our history with agressive wars and i 'm glad we did n't participate in this one . 
  same experience when i went to london , i was amazed that even in england they did n't care to check my passport thoroughly . 
  it 's kind of forbidden due to our basic law i guess . 
  the bundeswehr is only supposed to act on defense , but i guess that must 've changed since we 're involved in other conflicts . 
  help me fellow germans , i know too little about this . 
  i like french supermarkets the best . 
  supermarch\u00e9 and casino and stole my heart when i was younger and they had firecrackers in stock even in the summer . 
  it 's only legal to sell these from 27/12-31 / 12 in ze reich . 
  my mom tells me size does n't matter . 
  i do n't know what to believe anymore . 
  if i were oprah i 'd buy this store just to fire this schmuck . 
   her claims are a public relations disaster for switzerland , our correspondent says . 
  i really do n't like such conclusions . 
  that person was not a government official , but just a dick . 
  this should n't be treated as if switzerland is responsible . 
  no : / what makes us shitty ? 
  yeah , that 's also true .
