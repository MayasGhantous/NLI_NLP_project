  it 'd be hard to measure for outsiders . 
   is europe pal or is europe foe, 
   but there is less to envy in america today . 
  whatever osama bin laden thought he was doing by staging 9/11 he tipped the us towards developing a menacing and ever-more powerful security apparatus . 
  and accomplished what he intended . 
  i 'm really not sure why there 's an active war on terror when it was lost 12 years ago . 
  and it 's remarkable that norway did n't react this way after ` breivik ' but they actually fought this terrorism the right way , by becoming * more * open and democratic , not by closing themselves in and becoming authoritarian . 
  people are really making a mistake downvoting you because you 're just a troll , you a n't honestly believe all that ...  invading sovereign nations to murder people  prove it ? 
  iraq , pakistan . 
  one little thing : * iraq * guantanamo * overthrowing democraticly elected presidents in south america * spying on the whole world * invading sovereign nations to murder people should i go on with this * one * thing ? 
  as i see it , nothing is safe . 
  the nsa is snooping into all the traffic that enters and exits the us . 
  so unless you visit some government site in denmark you 're probably being watched . 
  you can be glad then that australia , nz , gb and canada are also involved in the nsa spying , they 're the big five . 
  oh and most other countries share information with these big fives . 
  so , maybe antarctica then ? 
  not sure why you 're downvoted , i 'm too critiial of mandatory voting ( even if it means that you have to go in the booth but nothing more . 
  and i 'm a person who would n't even be affected by this , i vote in every election possible . 
  wow , thanks for that detailed explanation . 
  i have to admit that i do n't know much about luxembourgish politics and just assumed that you have a highly fragmented party system just as the netherlands and belgium . 
  intersting to see that it 's pretty much the opposite . 
  i 'm not a fan of strong political leaders or candidate orientation , i think that this offers much potential for abuse . 
  it 's not very different in germany , merkel is well liked by the masses and most people ca n't imagine that she wo n't be chancellor any more . 
  even me , and i 'm not a big fan of hers . 
  i do n't see any other candidate that could represent germany in the same way she does . 
  but that 's also due to a crisis of our second largest party . 
  we 'll have elections soon and i 'm interested wheter or not our predictions will become true  p.s. 
  : your english is outstanding , it was very nice to read your comment !, 
  do you really think so ? 
  how can he be successful if he admits that he was making mistakes , how do people trust him to not make those mistakes again ? 
  wow he definitely looks older than 58 . 
  amazing that it only took 3 hours from `` i wo n't resign '' to `` i will resign '' . 
  i submitted the euronews link as a standalone post and saw your article and this comment after that , i had n't even hear that he may resign . 
  incredible development !, 
  they 're probably not talking about these user-cloud services but rather services like amazon e3 , which will provide the initial servers . 
  i do n't care that much , most people wo n't know the differencce between something like this and anything else either way . 
  it 's your decision , but i would n't want that to be on oru coin . 
  i was kind of baffled when i read a letter that my greatgreat grandma got from the prime minister of my our state and he wished her `` gods blessings '' . 
  then again , it was a personal letter and he 's in the cdu . 
  but i 'm not sure if a non-christian would get the same letter . 
  it 's still a form of religion and has therefore nothing to do on the coin , imho . 
  well imho religious things should n't be on a euro coin since we 're not a religious union but a political union that shares the values of freedom , democracy and unity , not religion . 
  and other religios groups should n't be ridiculed , neither should non-believers . 
  but what will be on the front - this is the real question !, 
  this weeks issues : * * raf pretty much inactive at this point * * * berlin wall finally fallen * * * check out merkels new haircut that udo waltz got her *, 
  seems like i did n't catch this , thank 's for the reply . 
  seems like i did n't catch this , thank 's for the reply . 
  does n't he have some emergency papers from ecuador though ? 
  he 's also a priest . 
  and * loooooooooves * freedom . 
  so probably something like [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/iimuhsxyzgk?t=7m10s ), 
  sadly were still wielding clubs rather than pencils : /, 
  you should write poems , that was a beautiful composition !, 
  sadly not yet , no , but that sounds like fun . 
  may also invite half of asia :d, 
  there 's always family for that . 
  but you 're right . 
  and it 's totally okay to identify with your country . 
  i just never got the point of pride on such a large scale . 
  and why it has to be a competition . 
  no , i was * totally * saying that germans , germany , the german language and most of all ** german shepherds ** are the worst of all . 
  especially me , since i 'm a german shepherd living with a german speaking german in germany . 
  i never got the point of * national * pride . 
  be proud of what you accomplish , what good things you do . 
  but i would n't want to be proud of my country by default . 
  it 's just a line that was drawn in some point , the line could be 100km west of where it is now . 
  and to me there is no need for lines at all . 
  we 're all humans , are n't we ? 
  wow , that was really not what i was implying . 
  i just find our language to be ` edged ' and rough . 
  which does n't have anything to do with ww ii ( which by the way not even my grandparents fought ) . 
  it 's just not as nice sounding as french or in some way english , that is all . 
  i like the german language , just like i like the smell of gasoline . 
  but the smell of roses is still more appealing , 
  boy , even to me our language sounds angry ... 
  nevertheless : wilkommen liebe kroaten  ^ ^ smileys ^ ^ should ^ ^ be ^ ^ mandatory ^ ^ in ^ ^ the ^ ^ german ^ ^ language ^ ^ so ^ ^ that ^ ^ you ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ sound ^ ^ hostile ^ ^ , 
  but he 's bullshitting us , lying straight to our faces . 
  making promises he wo n't keep . 
  and we have to pay for this . 
  no thank you , you can keep your shitty president , there are greater problems in the us than there are here . 
  and i do n't want teh us as an ally anymore . 
  he just should 've stayed home , his visit was a joke . 
  time for a stricter * yankee go home * sentiment . 
  rightfully so if you ask me . 
  ca n't be too concerned with privacy , it 's a basic ( human ) right to me . 
  come on , it was a funny remark and especially adressed to the / r/gaming circlejerk . 
  germans are kind of odd this way , i do n't think that most people are not willing to help you but we do n't have this openless and unwound attitude that people from the british isles or say australia seem to have . 
  that 's kind of sad , i always make sure to look out if anyone needs help especially when they really look like they search for something and especially when they do n't seem to be from the region . 
  i find the people to be much more relaxed here than in hessen , which is kind of nice . 
  in the first week here i ran into an elderly man in the supermarket , i instantly apologized but je just laughed and said that it was fine , that would n't have happened were i 'm originally from . 
  are there study fees though ? 
  i think scotland does n't have them for any eu citizen , which would be quite an adventage . 
  and how are the costs of living ? 
  a friend is going to rotterdam this fall and his rent will twice as much as mine ( well mine is pretty low , but still ) . 
  not a hard change wheater-wise , huh ? 
   i really need to go there some time , i have n't traveled as much as i 'd like to have , i hope i can take a semester abroad and ireland would be great to do this . 
  i could improve my english and - at least my stereotype and a few stories from people who spent some time there tell me that - you 're great people over there :d, 
  i 'm from hessen but i currently live in th\u00fcringen for studies , 
  probably in most rewe , edeka and teguts . 
  i just created and then deleted an account ( does n't fit my needs , i want to select the folders that will be synced , not just one folder with subfolders ) and this is what they show me : [ ~ it can take up to 30 days to delete your data ] ( http://puu.sh/3i4zh.png ) they surely do n't take privacy * that * serious if they only wipe this every 30 days .
