  you can get salted here , at least were i live . 
  i spend an ridiculous amount of my life looking for butter so that i do n't accidently grad some salted . 
  okay this is not true , but in my head it kinda is . 
  sometimes the salted ones are silver and the unsalted ones are golden . 
  that 's all i can tell you about the state of butter in germany right now . 
  i 'm not sure about this , but my gut would tell me so , yes . 
  i do n't think that the young and educated people are the problem , it 's rather the more conservative people or the government . 
  but that 's just my opinion , so it 's still good that you listed it . 
  i do n't find it funny , sorry . 
  i agree , i also like this type better . 
  sadly we do n't have much satirical newspapers in germany , probably only titanic , which covers i sometimes find amusing , but definitely not high quality stuff like speld seems to be . 
  a [ recent cover ] ( http://www.titanic-magazin.de/uploads/pics/01-u1-titel-201305-zschaepe_03.jpg ) with [ beate zsch\u00e4pe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beate_zsch%c3%a4pe ) and the title ` forced marriage for zsch\u00e4pe ' may be a good , rather dark example . 
  is it a satirical newspaper like the onion ? 
  they probably have the most intelligence agencies but i think nothing beats states like north korea , china , saudi arabia . 
  i read witchcraft . 
  this is banned in germany , fyi . 
  what about do n't doing this neither there nor here . 
  i think we should start to shape a decleration of basic human privacy rights and anyone who does n't obey them can bugger off . 
  but who am i kidding , the us does n't even respect the actual basic human rights . 
  do you really think that the nsa cares about legal means ? 
  i just replaced them and until now they work pretty well , at least for simple searches . 
  you can always use google when duckduckgo does n't find anything . 
  you shoudl give it a try , but a real try . 
  such a change takes a few moments . 
  we 'll give her another 5 years . 
  even the dutch ministery of defense sounds cute . 
  not to me , no . 
  i just find this humor ` childish ' ( in lack of better word ) and too comical . 
  it 's okay , you still rank higher than them : [ page 4 ] ( https://portoncv.gov.cv/dhub/porton.por_global.open_file?p_doc_id=1034 ) . 
  fuckin ' norway with their freedom and democracy . 
  at least it 's warm where i live ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  you 're completely right when you say that wy has more weight than nh . 
  i kind of worded that badly , in this case it does n't matter what they vote for , what i wanted to point out is that nh is a swing state and that their votes are * more intersting * than wy 's . 
  that 's probably why nh is more often cited as the most influential state although it 's technically wy . 
  wyoming indeed has a stronger position in the electoral college but it 's a strong republican state . 
  theoretically the votes of wyoming matter the most but in practice  the biggest winners in the system , those whose votes count the most , live in just four states : colorado , new hampshire , iowa and nevada . 
  they have low voter-to-elector ratios and are in battleground states . 
  only 4 percent of the nation 's eligible voters -- 1 in 25 -- live in those states . 
  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/electoral-college-math-not-all-votes-are-equal and now i want pretty much every european to be thankfull of their voting system , 
  and yet they have much more votes per 100k citizens than most other countries . 
  they 're the new hempshire of the eu . 
  what word are you talking about , all i see is  but we still know what ______________________________________ is . 
  you 're welcome . 
  consider to donate a small amount if you use it on a regular basis or want to support the cause . 
  i think it 's a great project . 
  i get what you 're saying , i do n't see a huge irony in there . 
  would be similar to calling it ironic that germany is a democratic country now that actively pursues more freedom in europe in the world although the nazis ruled ` just ' ~ 70 years ago . 
  [ another one , no data limits ] ( http://www.vpnbook.com/ ), 
  streetview was a privacy issue for many and since i do n't see a huge advantage to google knowing everything i actually side with them . 
  i 'm not sure why twitter is n't as widespread as elsewhere but facebook surely is , many people do n't seem to ` get ' the concept of twitter or do n't like it . 
  does n't really apply on this map , just look at germany . 
  edit : typo, 
  neither do i. 
  but there are few people that i 'd say i * hate * . 
  that 's the cutes german i 've ever heard , i imagined yourself as a teenage girl with a slight franco-canadian accent , while you 're probably not . 
  it sickens me that there are negotiations about this . 
  how could germany ever say * no we wo n't give you anything * to holocaust victims . 
  if the elders really need money why are there not other people who pay for this ? 
  `` we are seeing germany 's continued commitment to fulfill its historic obligation to nazi victims '' - this is not our obligation anymore , we 've payed our debt and we ca n't actually ever call it even no matter how much money we give them , so please stop milking us . 
  he 's not german , he 's an american * visiting * germany and also a big fat phony . 
  but quite funny at least , 
  we 'll never catch a break from this one . 
  on a serious note : nobody in their right mind is denying that it was a horrible thing what the nazis did to jews , roma , homosexuals and many more innocent people . 
  but i never got how money can balance such horrible events . 
  i actually find it repelling to be offered money since there is nothing for me that could * ever * make us even with the survivors . 
  but neither i nor my parents took part in the actions of the holocaust , my granfather was a little boy in 1945 . 
  i really hope that things change when the oldest people on this lovely planet were born in 1946 . 
  it shall never be forgottten and i 'll make sure of that myself when i educate my children and grandchildren about all this , but i do n't think that these reparations are the right way to go . 
  i assumed tap water and i was n't implying that either spain or sweden has bad tapwater , but rather that you may feel different about the quality when you get asked a subjective question . 
  just like -5 \u00b0 c is rather cold for me and it 's likely not a big deal for north swede but a huge deal for someone from south spain . 
  the thing is that there are also personal views in the data :  germany also does well in terms of water quality , as 93 % of people say they are satisfied with the quality of their water , more than the oecd average of 84 % . 
  well but maybe germans are just more critical than people from spain or sweden . 
  we have very high standards regarding water , actually higher standards than for bottled water . 
  not very different . 
  why are they protesting , what are they afraid of if they 're not just homophobes ? 
  so why are they protesting * against gay marriage * if they are n't in some way homophobic ? 
  why are they protesting if not that because they 're afraid that something bad could come of off that ? 
  . . or they do , i 'm not sure in this situation . 
  here 's a screenshot from his topcomment in / r/worldnews : http://puu.sh/31ep9.png and yes , troll or extreme racist : http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f1rhd/nearly_twothirds_of_people_in_the_uk_believe/ca6bgf7, 
  i 'm sad that you deleted your initial [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1euarj/man_hacked_and_beheaded_with_meat_cleaver_by_two/ca3vn51 ) in the / r/worldnews thread . 
  gladly there 's [ uneditreddit ] ( http://puu.sh/31ep9.png ) , mr. xenophobe . 
  well if anyone actually believed that germans have absolutely no sense of humor , then yes . 
  even a bad humor is humor . 
   that 's why we need more people like ayaan hirsi ali who come from that culture and are willing to publicly fight dangerous ideas that can breed within such ideology . 
  i wholeheartedly agree !, 
  ruthe and nichtlustig is actually the worst example of german humor i can think of ... edit : it was n't my intention to bash you so that you delete your comment , feel free to like whatever you want  here 's the link for anyone interested : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tr_8tboym, 
  i 'm not sure about the boston bombings because that hardly interests me but i don ' think that the people in the london murderer had a pretty life . 
  that 's no excuse but maybe an explanation . 
  i just wish more people would see the real denominating factor , poverty and poor education , instead of blamin islam . 
  just like video games : ego shooters do n't make a mass murderer but people who are fucked up can be influenced by brutal games . 
  we systimatically keep a whole continent ( africa ) from developing . 
  protectionism is a huge deal in the eu and the us and we do it so that farmers in africa ca n't compete with local prices . 
  we actively ruin lives and wallow in luxury , that 's why many people in developing/poor nations hate us . 
  well since there were two plebiscites that helped hitler rise and he won both i 'd say that germans back that actually voted hitler into power . 
  sure , that was a few years before the ss or the holocaust ( actually ) started . 
  but what i 'm really talking about is that rioters , who sometimes do n't even act because they * are * muslims but just happen to be muslims , do not represent a whole religion . 
  people always complain and say that real , peaceful muslims should call this out but they fail to realize that a ) many muslims wo n't hear about this b ) some ca n't express themselves as free as we can c ) they actually call this shit out , via twitter or whatever . 
  just do n't generalize such a huge group , the wbc does n't represent christians as well . 
  do n't underestimate darts , what if you get a scratch or something like that . 
  * bild * means * picture * if that 's what you 're asking .
