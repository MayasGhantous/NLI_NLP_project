  in there . 
  those are terrorists , that was n't an attack from a nation that was declared , jst two terrorist . 
  you could also ask the usa that question . . 
  it 's fascinating that there can exist such an ignorance towards geography in a country that consists nearly entirely of immigrants . 
  [ romanticism ] ( http://coursesite.uhcl.edu/hsh/whitec/terms/r/romanticism.htm ) actually has quite a few fitting elements in this scenario . 
  * * farewell/sendoff * * * remoteness * * * loneliness * and even * * death * it just would n't fit in the * modern * , simplified definition of romantic things . 
  nobody would go ahead and say `` oh loneliness is so romantic '' . 
  well at least we only ` harmed ' ourself . 
  that 's nothing !, 
  the most seen german news show got our [ own flag ] ( http://www.kiwitz.com/blogfotos/2008/06/tagesschau.png ) wrong ... 
  as i see it orangen are larger whilst apfelsinen are smaller and sweeter . 
  also this of course , you 're right . 
  there are many things like this , tpb blocks in the uk and netherlands iirc . 
  and although it 's very easy to circumvent this with a proxy or a vpn it still worries me . 
  sure , theses sites are often or most of the time linked with illegal filesharing but there 's still legal file sharing/video hosting . 
  stormfront is also blocked , i sure do n't want it to exist in the first place but i 'm not sure if a block is the right way to do this . 
  i think they should link this to a wikipedia site about right extremism . 
  i 'd say it 's far more drastical than u/countvontroll described it . 
  * as i see it * ( i want to stress that because it 's an opinion ) theypretty much droppen anything i liked them for i.e. 
  civil rights and protection of privacy . 
  guido westerwelle ( who used to be the parties chairman ) recently voted with abstention on wheter or not gay marriage should be allowed . 
  he 's gay . 
  i seriously ca n't take them serious anymore and i think the onl people who still vote for them are rich people and business owners . 
  when i enter the voting booth my first and only thought is literally ` how do i fuck up ortus and his friends most ' / s, 
  good translation . 
  remember that you vote for a whole party and not just one candidate and certainly not a chancelor . 
  steinbr\u00fcck wo n't be chancelor . 
  so the only question is who will bring in the vice chancelor . 
  i hope you 're aware of / r/lanl _ german ( there 's also / r/lanl _ spanish / ) . 
  i really like this place since it 's so easy for a native speaker to help learners . 
  so feel free to come around if you have n't yet or just pm me , i 'm always glad to help !, 
  pm me your adress and i 'll send you a keyboard with an * \u00d6 *  no seriously , why do you speak german ? 
  so i 'm thinking ` bout this ribbon thing and i think we should get more of these !, 
  maybe they 'll also have [ these ] ( http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/images/24106851.jpg ) . 
  i can help , if you need some . 
  references : public class helloworld { public static void main ( string [ ] args ) { system.out.println ( `` helloworld '' ) ; } }, 
  well i think you should n't call it ` marriage equality ' until you 're freely able to marry anyone you want , regardless of any gender . 
  congratulations from your neighbor , i hope we follow you soon . 
  you just did n't care to listen what they say for a minute . 
  that 's * your * problem . 
  media is heavily biased . 
  ask some people in greece how germans are portrait or ask me about how the biggest tabloid called them ` broke-greeks ' for weeks . 
  fuck this bullshit , i want unfiltered interaction . 
  they just want to reach large investors which is actually achievable when you have many likes on facebook . 
  even imgur asked for those likes although they 're really well known but some investors seem to really care about these likes . 
  there are only honest people in here . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ kiddin ', 
  that 's rather due to unemployment i 'd say . 
  other rather extreme parties are pretty pupular too like * die linke * ( socialist party ) . 
  people migrated when the wall fell , especially women . 
  some cities there will even pay woman to move back . 
  everything +14 , yes . 
  i was very confused at first because i was only aware of [ this ] ( http://www.bueromarkt-ag.de/bilder/micro-sd-karte_sandisk_16_gb,p-msd16-sd,s-700.jpg ) not what you wrote . 
  nothing beats [ biebian ] ( http://biebian.sourceforge.net/ ) . 
  i actually installed it on a vm and i seriously ca n't complain . 
  works like advertised , baby . ^ ^ baby ^ ^ ^ ^ baby ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ oooooh, 
  i second this . 
  very good for unbiased news coverage . 
  i 'd be in favor of banning this site . 
  it 's biased and run by the russian government . 
  sadly it is n't : /, 
  seems like a valid point . 
  while we 're at it : thank you mods for cleaning up this place !, 
  not if you say :  the people do n't have a right on privacy  people should just accept that most european countries are drifting to the political right . 
   people are n't people but banks are people . 
  that would be a stereotype . 
  and a rather non fitting . 
  of course some germans are tied up but i would n't think that brits are funnier . 
  but remember that a filled fridge will consume less energy . 
   there 's an old usa children 's rhyme [ 1 ] http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=step%20on%20a%20crack%2c%20break%20your%20mother's%20back that establishes ` crack ' as the correct colloquial term . 
  i looked it up and found joint . 
  it made sense since the panels are joined at this joint . 
  but i thought it 'd be confusing if i wrote that . 
  but hey , i 'm a man of the people . 
  thanks for the reply , 
  as i said , it 's stupid and i have no reason . 
  but i 'm a little special when it comes to fridges . 
  i wo n't even put unwrapped food in there . 
  it can be brand new and cleaned with industrial cleaner - i still wo n't . 
  do n't know why but i think i can live with that . 
  in the end it 's nothing more than not being allowed to step on cracks ( do n't know if that 's the right word , i mean the things between stone panels ), 
  that 's what i meant and i honestly do n't understand why anyone does it . 
  i looks nice though . 
  they are and they make pretty much everything . 
  if you want to get really awesome tools choose the blue series . 
  they 're professional tools and professionally expensive . 
  but be assured that this fridge will still do it 's job in 2050 . 
  i have a bosh myself and it 's from the 90s i guess . 
  it 's not energy-effiient but i ca n't afford a better one . 
  i do n't like those , i think they 're unhygienic . 
  stupid assumption i know but i would n't bother to place them in there either way :d, 
  i do n't buy them refrigerated but i put them in the fridge when i come home . 
  thank 's for the reply  it 's also pretty chaotic over here . 
  and it 's even more difficult when there are 16 versions of it ( each for every * bundesland * ) . 
  i went to a private gymnasium and there was a school literally on the other side of the road and even between these schools were some differences . 
  it 's an omnipresent issue in germany ( next to healt care system and how we 're supposed to write fucking properly ) and i 'm glad it is since it 's very important but as much as i like federalism ( and education is one of the few responsibilitys that are left to the * l\u00e4nder * ) i wish there would be a more consistent system . 
   slovak citizens have the same status in czech academia as locals . 
  that 's actually really cool , 
  well op asked about when people start university . 
  it 's highly unlikely that people who went to * hauptschule * will go to university ( though i know two people who did this ) .
