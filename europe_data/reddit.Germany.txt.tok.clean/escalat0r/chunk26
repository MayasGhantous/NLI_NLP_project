  i and probably him just found it to be irrelevant . 
  you know what ... you 're horrible . 
  you 're mom 's horrible . 
  i actually do n't care for the whole esc but that one 's at least better than a rip-off of you 're song from last year . 
  i just want ` kind of a nice guy ' : /, 
  i think they were refferring to the habit that people from the usa say they 're irish just because they had a great-grandfather who was irish . 
  but since you have dual citizenship you have to be partly a real ire . 
  i 'm jealous !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js0iym4mpro ) would 've won if there would 've been a fair voting system . 
  the voting went similar to the real esc . 
  three parties , a jury , radiostations and callers could vote . 
  radio and callers favored this but the jury containing of 4 ` experts ' ruled them out ( giving them * one * point ; the radio stations gave them 12 ) it 's bullshit and you should give us 1 point . 
  edit : * nackert * s is bavarian for * naked * . 
  it may not be a great song but at least it 's joyful and * something different * and i hate when something is faked . 
  4 people ruled out many thousand people ( callers and radio stations ) , that 's just unfair . 
   realschule which is a easier version of the gymnasium . 
  it 's actually a different kind of school form and you can continue with you education after the 6 years of * realschule * so you can still attend uni after that . 
   so you will be able to have your first university degree at the age of 20/21 now . 
  i just want to add that tha 's highly uncommon . 
  most people will have their bachelors degree a little bit later , maybe 23 . 
  apparently slovakia has the most similar system to germany , very interesting . 
  obama recently praised the german school system ( i actually do n't know why , i find it to be a mess ) . 
  are you pleased with your system or would you change anything ? 
  germany : ( it varies from state to state so here it goes for hessen ) : * 6-7 - * grundschule * ( pre-school ) 4 years * 10-11 - * gymnasium * - high school used to be 9 years , now it 's 8 . 
  * many people do something in between this time ( at least in my surroundings ) - all voluntary ( voluntary service , military service/civilian service - both now cancelled ) 6 to 12 month * 18-19 - off to the * universit\u00e4t * or * [ fachhochschule ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fachhochschule ) * ( classic university or university for applied sciences ), 
  wow i never would 've thought that you 're not a native speaker . 
  i just wanted to tell you to translate your ver well fitting reply so others can understand , 
  remember that you 're not in a german sub here . 
  tl ; dr : britan ~ ~ can ~ ~ should into urope . 
  i bet he 's a muslim . 
  wow that 's really not funny . 
  not offensive , just unfunny . 
  seems you are frustrated . 
  that 's okay . 
  but please do n't spam . 
  or berlin with the rest of germany . 
  even funnier : richard dawkins - 1:666 . 
  that simply ca n't be a coincidence . 
  seem like i was n't familiar with this phrase . 
  thanks for explaining , i thought they meant it literal . 
  i 'm a student so i do n't have much money but i tip nevertheless . 
  i do n't have a specific rule and it depends on how much the service costs ( i 'll tip more if it 's more expensive ) . 
  i just do n't tip if the prices are unreasonable . 
  but that 's also shitty , because it 's not the waiters fault . 
  i know exactly what you mean by ` make you go out of your way for them ' and i hate these people . 
  when a waiter walks up to you and has probably walked much more than you or even has to carry multiple plates * you * just move , not the waiter . 
  i 'm very embarassed when i see this . 
  have fun , 
  that 's all i 'm asking for . 
  todays picture is kind of sad . 
  i think it 's good that shops are closed on sundays but if you need something important it sucks that you have to look for a gas station or a kiosk which will have extreme high prices . 
  and even some restaurants are closed , which is kind of stupid since many people are free on sundays ... 
  awesome !, 
  no hurry , i 'll be paitient . 
  i just do n't like it if there 's a post every 12 days :p, 
  i already look at the blog a lot and it 's really amusing . 
  please keep on the regulary posting ( :, 
  not that i care for it but thanks anyways  my comment was n't really clear so i ca n't blame anyone . 
  i just stated that he 's right . 
  neither of them were members which means that they were candidate countries . 
  it actually does n't mean that , mexico is n't a candidate but you know what i 'm talking about . 
  and you are super fast at replying , 
  you 're right , it 's [ 2006 ] ( http://puu.sh/1s48t.jpg ) . 
  map says 2006 , so neither of them wer * e * members . 
  must be the same people that moved the brandenburg gate 300km south-west . 
  do n't get me wrong , there is a lot of crap on there . 
  i wish it would be more like the bbc , they do amazing stuff !, 
  i think it 's a positive thing that we have public stations for ( more ) independent news coverage and somewhat quality television , but i found the previous system unfair . 
  now everyone has to pay for it no matter if they have a radio/tv/pc or not . 
  it 's cool this way because ( hopefully ) more people will watch/listen/consume the public media and get more educated . 
  at least more than through private channels . 
  stop it if you can . 
  many students do n't have tv 's for example . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  they also included pcs that are able to access the internet just because you have the option to stream content on their websites . 
  so everybody has to pay for it even if they just use their pc to send an receive emails . 
  but the gez ( they collect these fees ) are mostly hated because of how they act . 
  you 'll often hear of cases where they threaten people . 
  and they charged the university of heidelberg for their 200 + tv 's that were only used for showing videos and did n't even had a tv connection but they * could have * one - backdated for the last 30 years . 
  i think it was some 100k euro back then . 
   apparently there is a suggestion that one should start charging people the tv tax , even if they do not have a tv , just a computer . 
  just came today , in my opinion not very likely . 
  we have that shit too ... 
  wow you seem bitter . 
  more borders , more governments . 
  this is clearly what europe needs and what europe is heading to . 
  this is the worst website i have ever seen . 
  do n't ever post something from there unless it 's in / r/adviceanimals or / r/atheism !, 
  why do we even listen to the bullshit he says ? 
  what an intelligent comment . 
  i 'd like to submit this to / r/bestof , are you okay with that ? 
  schr\u00f6der is a prostitute and will whore himself out for everyone . 
  dae urope = good ? 
  i think he/she meant iraq . 
  yeah . 
  fuck that . 
  urope good . 
  ` murica bad . 
  seriously , what 's the harm ? 
  ( honest question ) people will get this book if they want it anyway .
