  a large city is often really different from the rest of the country , same with berlin or new york . 
  istanbul has many people from all over the world in it , so it 's internationalised . 
  right , the excuse for american propaganda is usually that it 's supposed to make the movie more thrilling . 
  rougly translates to :  furthermore historians believe that hitler would serve the british administration ( in 1944 ) more dead than alive due to his irrational stretegics . 
  all that nazi gold means switzerland will forever be on the plus side . 
   nazi germany and the communist soviet union , there could be no winning for the states and peoples trapped in-between , just more or less suffering . 
  great comment and a powerful statement , i ca n't imagine what it must 've felt like to be a pole or someone from the baltic states in that time , * trapped in-between two totalitarian states * puts it very well . 
  not sure if i get your point : /, 
  i 'm 100 % against this but it is n't really ` traitorous ' , is it ? 
   they do n't want to publicly embarrass merkel a healthy relationship should have fights and it should be able to work through them , there is n't * enough * embarrassment and outcry and shaming , it * should * be more !, 
  i 'd be pissed at any colaboration to spy against a befriended nation but spying on our closest ally just shows you that there are no boundaries in the intelligence community . 
   itt : people not getting jokes it 's not our fault :(, 
   germans have no experience with communism . 
  okay , troll confirmed . 
  [ a comic that sums it up ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fldrxxi.jpg )  mr. \u00dcg\u00fcl\u00fcp\u00fc , as one of 750 devout muslims in dresden you alone have to threat over 700 of your fellow citizens with islamisation . 
  how do you do it ? 
   with german efficiancy . 
  ( dresden has 525.000 inhabitants and 750 devout muslims , that 's 0,0014 % of the population , iirc it 's 0,6 or 0,06 % for the state of saxony , and yet that is the only area where pegida could establish their movement . ), 
  i 'm just going to assume your trolling here . 
  surely the us must be at the center of things , right ? 
  ca n't be not # 1 ... 
  iirc he was drafted into the ss but volunteered for the wehrmacht , just as a correction . 
   `` kai diekmann '' just for some context for anyone who is n't too familiar with that name or german media : kai diekmann is editor in chief of * bild * , a german tabloid and compareable to * the sun * . 
  he 's a shithead to put it lightly , constantly scare-mongering etc. , you know the drill . 
  this was n't meant to be taken seriously , really not , just to share some corrupt ( ed ) politicians from germany to romania . 
  radu maz\u0103re seems a little bit more fun though to be honest . 
  i do this every morning right before i brush my teeth , got ta stay sharp and review those flags . 
  uncensored videos of naked kids ? 
  check . 
  currently a vacant position in politics ? 
  check . 
  time to move , [ sebastian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sebastian_edathy#resignation ) . 
  i would n't wish that on you romanian guys though , you 're nice , 
  you have a cool handwriting !, 
  with how many postcards that little girl will receive  isa  the netherlands will probably suffice , haha , 
  * height * would be pretty close to * heit * actually . 
  not how it 's pronounces , but g8 b8 sk8erboy :p, 
   silly willy * [ ... ]     * yep , i just invented that term right now :p rightfully so , our history teacher made sure that we understood that willhelm ii . 
  was a complete retard , she basically started all the lessons that time with stories about his fuckups ( she usually used * fettn\u00e4pfchen * which translates to * sandtrap * or * to blunder * as a verb which is well ... putting it mildly ) and ridiculed him based on this . 
  it would 've been funny if his bullshit would n't have cause so much trouble . 
  even more than that you 'll achieve the opposite , at least with me . 
  when someone compares someone to hitler i usually think `` okay buddy '' , because * usually * they 're not as bad as him , so i just think that you hold a grudge against that person and you blow things out of proportion . 
   puts * 1kg * weight on a precision scale what are you , a commie ? 
  it 's on amazon . 
  ** co.uk ** , ~ ~ supply and demand ~ ~ well this would be an exception to the rule of supply and demand , actually opposite supply and demand ... cut me some slack here , i 'm trying to make a joke !, 
  not that i 'd ever argue to be proud of your country but what is your trouble with the country you 're from ( italy ) ? 
  no i 'm just sick of people spreading bullshit to make their country look better . 
  haha :d, 
  you do n't count with all your oil moneys . 
  only one thing to do , throw them off a cliff like the spartans did it . 
  pretty tough though in both countries . 
  just to add to this , * erregen * can also mean to stimulate , in a positive way ( also sexual arrousal but that 's not too relevant here although varoufakis probably has some game with the ladies ) . 
  and i think `` a middle finger stirs the republic '' is quite accurate , people are discussing the finger , some view it very negatively , some find it funny , some even agree with it and especially since #varoufake it 's a very hot topic in germany . 
  you could also be clever and say `` a middle finger pokes the republic '' . 
  and all magazines do it , [ titanic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titanic_%28magazine%29 ) is a german satirical magazine and iirc their issues with hitler or something hitler relatved sell 3 times of what the other issues would sell so they regularily ( probably every 4-6 issues ) put him on the cover . 
  it 's a common spiel . 
   i can remember something happened there only some time ago . 
  yeah and i can remember ten things happening in germany after that and even today , do n't twist the facts you jackass . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground just to name one ... 
  you do n't even need to go that far back , the [ nsu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground ) was a thing and it 's still not clear how german agencies helped them cover their tracks . 
  nazism is sadly alive in germany , as it is in pretty much all of the western world . 
  biking is definitely a thing in germany although nowhere near as big and great as it 's in denmark or the netherlands but i 'm always puzzled when i learn that someone ca n't ride a bike or swim , does n't happen often but when it does it always weirds me out , what did these kids do when they were young ? 
  am i saying that the ( german ) media is always right and portrays things without any bias ? 
  no , that 's just not possible because you first have to pick a limited number of topics that you cover and than have to choose the specifics of that story that you want to cover . 
  but there is a really great margin between that and propaganda , seriously . 
  so apparently the finger was the real one and b\u00f6hmermann faked it . 
  do n't know what to believe though but it surely is funny as hell and points out how ridiculous the initial uproar is . 
  i like that , 
  ah they changed it . 
  makes sense after all , i do n't think they have a huge bandwith from the few people abroad that watch it . 
  just so you know , all the mediatheken are blocked for non german ips iirc . 
  neutral power strikes again . 
  you 're right though !, 
  russia today . 
  so you are one of the people that claim that ? 
  can you point out what is propaganda ? 
  i really did n't get the uproar in the first place . 
  varoufakis did n't have a public position at that time so he did n't represent anyone but himself ( i would argue that it would be different if he had done this as the greek secretary of finance or even as a mayor or so ) . 
  and between you and me i would n't have cared if he would 've done it after he became secretary of finance , at least through him there are talks about the whole situation . 
  i do n't know enough to judge the situation myself but i would n't be suprised if germany deserved that finger , many people deserve that finger . 
  there is a person speaking in the video that basically confirms that , yes . 
   which is propaganda care to point out some of that propaganda ? 
  i thought we were over this * l\u00fcgenpresse , the only ones that tell the truth are rt * bullshit ... 
  well the eu is already represented on other continents besides europe . 
  amateurs , the most efficient thing to do is to get one group that you can blame for everything . 
  no i wo n't share ours because it 's just too good to not have it all for yourself ( it 's the swiss army knife of scapegoats ) but it starts with a `` j '' and ends with the sound you make when you see one . 
  seriously , get on our level , russia . 
  [ you ' goin ' choke yerself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsygrut7t0s ), 
   the people paying for the ads like to know if they are successful or not , also they try to maximize their click-through rate . 
  yeah but this exposes you to privacy violations and in extreme cases to malware . 
  ai n't gon na happen with me . 
  this is the best explanation then , thanks for providing the source , very interesting , 
  yeah this could be an explanation . 
  i remember a few of those and most countries had multiple countries that they liked pretty well . 
  i 'm not expecting everybody to love everybody , but how can someone nit like the dutch as people for example , that 's just beyond my imagination . 
  read my comment again . 
  well this is what i mean , it 's just negativity in general . 
  fair point, 
  indifference means that you do n't feel anything towards something , so it ca n't be positive by definition . 
  if you do n't care about baseball you do not like it , right .
