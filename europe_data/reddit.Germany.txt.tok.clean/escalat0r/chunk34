  so the statement that - according to this graph - there is no country that poles seem to genuinely like , is true . 
  i find that sad to be honest . 
  there is very much a difference , what are you saying ? 
  not according to this translation : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dsa63/the_attitudes_of_the_poles_toward_other_nations/d1tvr8t, 
  ah sorry , i replied to the wrong person, 
  ~ ~ not according to this translation : ~ ~ ~ ~ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dsa63/the_attitudes_of_the_poles_toward_other_nations/d1tvr8t~~, 
  wow , not one country that poles actually like (  50 % ) , that 's pretty sad : /, 
   i can appreciate how outside perspectives are n't really wanted though . 
  that 's not the point , outside perspectives are welcome , just not from people who have zero clue , which means the majority of reddit . 
   but reddit has informed me that germany ( and europe in general ) is now completely unsafe especially for women . 
  to be fair , sharia law improved things when it was introduced last month . 
  some people wrongfully claimed that there were * 1000 * , compared to that it 's really * only 5 * . 
   i am sorry you feel this level of contempt against people who simply feel a specific way ... that does n't concern or affect you . 
  well , that 's what fascists do , they want to force their views on others , through nationalism for example . 
  good to see that there are still rational people left in here !, 
   wished to visit during my youth , not so much now . 
  right , so you 're `` polish '' and `` irish '' without ever having been to one of those coutries , as usual , lol . 
   nationalism does n't cause these things yes it does , do n't tell a german that nationalism is n't a major reason for ww ii  but instead of blinding love , you have blinding hate . 
  nope , just a very strong disdain for nationalism . 
  you calling that `` hate '' is exactly what nationalism does , you 're one of those guys that says `` either you love your country or you hate it '' , pretty totalitarian to me . 
  did n't understand the rest of your comment to be honest , but your assertion of germany is very funny to me , an american telling me how it really is where i live , lol . 
  the modern days jewish world conspiracy ... 
   i 'm irish and polish . 
  so , american , right ? 
   the best you can do is try not to repeat it , right , and you do that by actively remembering it and realising that nationalism will cause these atrocities if it rises up again . 
  this is why nationalism needs to stop to exist , it leads to horrible things !, 
  i think i 'm done at this points i 've read enough of your comments and some other stuff you posted , you sound like somebody that really has n't the capability to grasp why nationalism is useless and dangerous , you even asked [ why racism is a bad thing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4b2sip/eli5_why_is_racism_bad_exactly_or_why_is_it_a/ ) , what the actual fuck ... 
  try accomplishing something real in your life so you do n't have to fall back on your ` heritage ' to find something to be proud of , otherwise you 'll be a victim of history , because nationalism is dying with each passing day and your ` heritage ' is becoming more and more irrelevant . 
   to shed some sin done by people long dead as i know the holocaust is over hyped to all hell in germany , which looking at every other country that committed mass atrocities on a larger scale and at the same time even , they do n't give a shit in the modern day . 
  and this is supposed to be a good thing , that other countries are ignoring their atrocities ? 
  this is why you can fuck off with your bullshit nationalism , you think it 's more important to love your country than it is to remeber horrific crimes against humanity . 
  that is fucked up . 
  you 're a savage with a savage ideology , * this * is why i do n't want to be identified with people like you , regardless wheter or not we `` share a heritage '' . 
  we have nothing in common and i hope you do n't think that it 's different with other people from here . 
  face it , i and many other people care very little about things like heritage or their origin , at least not in the degree you 'd like to have it . 
  i 'm very interested in history and enjoy traditions and such , but i do n't use them to divide myself from other people . 
   actually it does , since nationalism is the strife for and continuation of a state that binds a particular group together . 
  nope , that 's just your weird interpretation of it . 
   if you oppose that you 're either an anarchist , full global communist tm or supporter of an anschluss with a third party . 
  again , i am not , i just know that nationalism is an outdated and superflous concept that a few people grasp to because they ca n't generate worth from something else in their life so they have to be proud of their country/heritage . 
  the world will work fine without nationalism , everyoe who has somethig to offer for this planet besides their `` nationality '' will do fine without it . 
   that having some sort of pride in your origin and heritage and wanting to preserve it for your children is a good thing . 
  again , what does it accomplish though , what does it matter what your origins are ? 
  i ask because i sincerely could n't care less about what nationality i have , it 's just a label someone gave me . 
  you 're on the `` blue team '' now , do you cherish this label as well ? 
  and still , opposing nationalism does n't mean you want to abolish the state , why would you even make such a ridiculous claim . 
   but with the quasi-religious propaganda around it . 
  care to give an example of the `` quasi-religious propaganda '' ? 
  edit : seems like you ca n't , lol, 
  so you think if someone does n't give a rats ass about patriotism/nationalism then they `` want to abolish germany as a state '' ? 
  i 've read your other comments in this thread but this seals the deal , you have no clue what you 're talking about with this topic and are just spouting nonsense . 
   also can someone explain me how afd are ` liberal-conservatives ' ? 
  they seem very backward on lots of issues to call themselves liberal . 
  they are neo-liberals in an economic sense , they want a flat tax for everyone ( 25 % iirc ) , even millionaires and they want to cut benefits etc. 
  they are definitely not liberals in the sense of personal liberties , you 're right about that . 
  on the contrary , they 're on the exact opposite of that spectrum , with many policies bordering forcing a lifestyle on people or what i 'd call , borderline-fascism . 
  they want to abolish certain studies , want to teach * less * about german crimes in ww ii which i think is horrific , and influence what gets shown on tv and in theaters , so that there is more `` classic german culture '' playing there . 
  what does it accomplish and why should t be pursued ? 
   statistically very few oppose it . 
  care to provide the statictic you 're citing here ? 
  because i think you 're talking out of your ass , many people in germany oppose or do not favor patriotism/nationalism . 
  why is is in their party 's program then , care to explain that ? 
  you 're right and wrong , she earned a doctorate as a physical chemist , but most of the time she 's just called a physicist i 'd say . 
  i 'm not . 
  patriotism accomplishes nothing and changes quickly into nationalism . 
  we made this mistake once , we wo n't make it again by following a useless `` hurr durr , germany is the best hurr durr '' mentality . 
  if anything we all should thrive to overcome nationalism and focus on a bigger identity such as humanity . 
  it 's far more important if someone shares your values than your passport . 
  thee afd is afraid of it , they voted it as one of the most concerning issues on a convention last year iirc . 
  i 'd agree with that definition of nationalism and i do n't think that there are very different prospects on nationalism . 
  it 's a more extreme form of patriotism although i hardly see a difference between both for the most part . 
  who pays the ones that support the notion that climate change is real and man made ? 
  big oil ? 
  there are more than two genders and there is no correlation between the gender ( s ) of a parent and a child 's happiness . 
   we conclude that there is a clear consensus in the social science literature indicating that american children living within same-sex parent households fare just , as well as those children residing within different-sex parent households over a wide array of well-being measures : academic performance , cognitive development , social development , psychological health , early sexual activity , and substance abuse . 
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4091994/ [ just to defelect one common response to someone posting a study , this is n't * one * study , it 's a meta-analysis about 48 studies in this case , so 48 studies say that it does n't matter what gender the parents of a child have . ], 
  why do you want to force one specific family model on people ? 
  man , you 're one old dude , haha . 
  did n't know that , but i guess it 's generally rising across germany/europe . 
  it was supposed to be a `` should n't '' , you should n't be afraid of society accepting the fact that therer are multiple genders and they all deserve to be represented , right ? 
  i was just giving input here , no opinion . 
  you should also stick to english , this is n't r/de . 
  if you 're looking for the trnalation of `` versifft '' to complete your little name calling then you should go with `` filthy '' . 
  what is perverted about `` studierende/lehrerinnen '' ? 
  feeling threatened in your manliness , haha ? 
  is n't that more a thig in saxony and bavaria though due to the czech border ? 
  so you should n't be afraid of an appropriate and open representation of all genders , right ? 
  even if it originates from feminist ideas it 's still only used in a fud context by the afd . 
  what are you afraid about anyways ? 
  i only hear it from you afd morons nowadays though . 
  just because they 're mocking your party does n't mean that it 's propaganda . 
  but you afd guys are notorious for playing the victim card , so i 'm not too suprised . 
  i could offer you a tissue if that would help in any way . 
  ah too bad , the actually use a mixture of wheat and soy as a basis for most of their products but i guess that 'd still be a no-go for you : /, 
  nope , it 's a far-right term . 
  with whom though ? 
  this wo n't offen any neo magazin royale viewers , that 'd be like the daily show offending people by supporting bernie sanders . 
  not much leben there though , just sadness . 
  he 's trying to have fun , get him boys !, 
  l\u00fcgenpresse is pretty much exclusivey used by right wing conspiritards .
