  i 'll try to give some context : 1 ) bdm-haul , is making fun of beauty channel videos which is one of b\u00f6hmermanns ( the host of the show , who plays hitler in these videos ) pet peeves . 
  bdm = [ ** b ** und ** d ** eutscher ** m ** \u00e4del ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/league_of_german_girls ) , the hitler youth equivalent for girls and young women . 
  it references [ ** dm ** ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/dm-drogerie_markt ) , a german drug store where you 'd get beauty products . 
  * boss parfume , well hugo boss designed the ss uniforms as we know from countless til posts , `` smells ike ernst r\u00f6hm right out of the shower '' * wunderbaum eiche = little tree ( car freshener ) oak = oaks are a symbol for something very german ( even nowadays ) and with symbolysm in the [ nazi medals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_nazi_germany ) ; generally a reference to an oaks sturdiness * the toothpaste `` leib colgate adolf hitler '' is referencing '' [ leibstandarte adolf hitler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_ss_panzer_division_leibstandarte_ss_adolf_hitler ) '' , the ss division responsible for the protection of hitler . 
  * lebens * raumspray * , well yeah , `` lebensraum '' means living space and the nazis claimed that germany needed/deserved living space in the east . 
  `` raumspray '' is the german word for `` air freshener '' . 
  adi says `` smells like right in front of moskow '' * no real joke about the q-tips , other than him needing 50 in the moring ( maybe i 'm not getting this one ) . 
  * alpecin 88 , yeah `` 88 '' references the 8th letter of the alphabet , so `` hh '' = `` heil hitler '' , common neo-nazi symbolism . 
  * * always * are `` binden '' , which is the german name for `` band '' as well as `` pads '' for women on their period . 
  not much references in the rest of the video , he asks for a `` right arm up '' for people who liked the video and for comments , although critical comments should include an adress so that the gestapo does n't have as much trouble . 
  _______ 2 ) i think most of this is self-explanatory or ca n't be translated _____ 3 ) as you probably know , * mein kampf * 's copyright has expired so that it can be re-printed again , adi is presenting alternative versions of his book . 
  1 : classical version but with a commentary of [ beatrix von storch ] , a member of the right-wing party afd . 
  `` storch '' also means `` stork '' and he 's referencing storch 's grandfather who 's the man in the black uniform in this [ photograph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ao1bx0v.jpg ) . 
  adi says that von storch 's commentary is pretty much in agreement with what he wrote . 
  2 : `` der kleine hitler nimmersatt '' , a reference to `` die kleine raupe nimmersatt '' / '' [ the very hungry caterpillar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_very_hungry_caterpillar ) '' , a very famous childrens book in germany . 
  3 : yeah , do n't need an explanation for that one i think * nr . 
  4 : `` vom klenen adolf der wissen wollte wer ihm ins gehirn ge ... \u00e4h ... auf den kopf gemacht hat '' `` about the little adolf who wanted to know who took a shit in his head ... uhm ... on his head '' , originally '' [ the story of the little mole who knew it was none of his business ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_story_of_the_little_mole_who_knew_it_was_none_of_his_business ) '' , a famous german childrens book . 
  5 : `` mein kampf im bett '' , `` mein kampf in bed/in the bedroom '' * nr . 
  6 : `` f\u00fcnf feinde und der hund blondie '' , `` five enemies and the dog blondie '' `` f\u00fcnf freunde '' means `` five friends '' and it 's the german translation of enid blytons '' [ famous five ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_famous_five_%28series%29 ) '' ; blondie was hitler\u00c4s german shepherd . 
  7 : `` die drei hakenkreuze und der verlorene weltkrieg '' , `` the three swastikas and the lost world war '' , referencing '' [ the three detectives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_investigators ) '' * nr . 
  munching food ) , by atilla hitler , referencing attila hildmann , who 's a famous german cook and author for vegan cookbooks who said some controversial stuff with right-wing tendencies . 
  ___ i probably missed a bunch of things , so feel free to ask away if you do n't get something . 
  a kid * mouthing * words and an adult actually saying them , oh the humanity . 
   are you implying they are n't ? 
  they certainly are not . 
  `` wir sind das volk '' was chanted by 500.000 people in leipzig in the late 1980s , who demanded democracy because * they * should rule - and they were right about that . 
  today it 's chanted by a small mob consisting of right wingers , xenophobes , conspiritards and straight up neo-nazis , who certainly * do n't * represent germany or democratic values . 
  they 're abusing a chant that asked for democracy for their hateful anti-democratic messages , it 's disgusting . 
  oh give me a break , it 's not propagada , it 's political satire and no party in germany is safe from being made fun of * and that is very important * . 
   also kids swearing . 
  nobody in germany gives a fuck about that . 
  also funded partly by the rundfunkbeitrag : bbc documentaries which are often produced in a partnership with zdf and great movies like citizenfour, 
  german public tv stations are n't payed by taxes . 
  yup , some people even believe that germany is a gmbh ( corporation ) , lol . 
  the backstory to this is qute ridiculous , shockig for a constpiracy theory i know . 
  there actually * is * a brd gmbh , which was founded in 1990 so right before unification . 
  and it 's also operated by the german government ( by proxy at least ) . 
  iirc the german government uses it to manage their stocks , which is quite typical and exists in every country . 
  get some tofurkey if you can , it 's an american brand and they make such great stuff , even my granddad who 's diet consists literally of 80 % meat says they taste great . 
  they have italian style sausages with dried tomatoes and basil in them , fucking delicious !, 
   and we dont know if they warned/informed the turkish government/intelligence service confidentially . 
  i 'd be suprised if they did n't . 
   not everyone can have food and clean water . 
  what an incredibly sad attitude . 
   if you want to help the workers you need to empower them , right and by giving them better wages through buying fair trade i 'm not empowering them . 
  the only way to empower people is to keep paying them shit wages by proxy . 
  * yeah , stupid bangladeshis , why do n't they just get a better job ? 
   somebody else already explained how `` fair trade '' mainly just leads to more middle men and the workers get nothing . 
  a huge part of the fair trade idea is to get rid of the middle men , so i do n't really know what you 're talking about here . 
  and of course your , mine and our consumer behaviour can change things for the better , by buying # 5.99 pants we support the current status quo . 
  you 're in some deep denial my friend . 
   of course conditions in bangladesh are terrible . 
  yet the western consumer is the last person responsible for it . 
  that 's just a bullshit excuse and you know it . 
  consumers could pay a * very small * amount more for their clothes and it 'd greatly improve conditions for the workers . 
  it 's called fair trade . 
  you actually find certain topics that are n't linked to right-wing ideas in the policies of right-wing parties . 
  in germany it 's also often animal rights and it 's happening in britain as well : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1353870/neo-nazis-join-animal-rights-groups.html, 
  even if he did , that certainly would n't make it okay . 
  an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind . 
  we 're equally secure if we just imprison people , you just want to have some revenge , which is archaic . 
  it 's savage to sink down to the same level as the people you want to condemn . 
  your ideas belong in the middle ages . 
   should now suffer in return . 
  a yeah , this is where we are apparently in 2016 , being fucking savages from the middle ages . 
  psychopaths like you would clearly belong in the second one , i 'd take it ? 
  yeah , sure , boohooo the world will end . 
  i have yet to notice any difference in my life , you really ca n't judge the situation from the uk . 
  most actually are n't . 
  your mom did n't deserve to be hit by your dad , but he was drunk so that explains why he did it . 
  get it now ? 
  yeah that 's a better term , i always translate it wrong . 
  you 're saying `` they 're bad and only the attackers are responsible , but ... '' . 
  there is no `` but '' , that 's my point . 
  if you 're including the `` but '' then you 're defending or excusing these attacks . 
  yes it is , `` logical '' implies that b is a direct result of a that is inevitable . 
  honestly , why are you defending a bunch of right-wingers who beat up completely innocent people ? 
  ca n't we just agree that it 's a racist and disgusting attack and be done with it ? 
  if you do n't support vigilante `` justice '' or revenge then you should n't write that , as simple as that . 
  it 's not my fault when i assume you support it when you wrote `` revenge is good '' . 
  it 's still not * logical * that this happened , this would imply that it 's reasonable , which it is n't . 
  it sadly has to be expected ( that 's probably what you wanted to say ) but it should n't . 
  i do n't agree with your second paragraph , nothing justifies these attacks , nothing . 
  it 's important to understand this , these were n't self defense cases due to tensions between refugees and germans , these were people who went out there and wanted to attack completely innocent people based on their race and that 's what they did . 
  * no man , i just like the number 8 that 's why i have it tattooed * . 
  twice . 
  right over that symbol here , which is supposed to be a bhuddism thing but my stupid tattoo artist got it wrong so it 's inverted *, 
  maybe i did read it wrong , but this thread is filled with people excusing the attacks . 
  still , the only people to blame for this cowardly attack are the attackers , there 's no way of excusing that . 
  now you 're just backpaddling . 
  there was no need for you to accept vigilante `` justice '' , it 's always wrong to take the law in your own hands . 
  period . 
  sure , it 's not very suprising , i 'm just disgusted that a comment which is excusing a racist attack is upvoted here . 
  okay then i misunderstood your previous cooments . 
  it read like `` has to be expected '' was a reasoning that this is okay . 
   racism and utter contempt for legal principles are part of it , but i refuse to believe that they 're the only things that led to this . 
  i think that 's actually the main motivation . 
  people with right-wing tendencies well before nye who used the opportunity to attack foreigners . 
  but yeah , if we do n't watch this closely we 're risking more attacks like this , especially because violance ( against foreigners ) as a form of political dissent is backed by movements like pegida or the afd, 
  people like you honestly scare me more than anything , you 're a danger to the state of law .
