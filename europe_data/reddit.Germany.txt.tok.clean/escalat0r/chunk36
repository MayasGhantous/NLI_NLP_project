  definitely not fucking vigilante justice , are you a moron ? 
  wow , seems like you 're actually looking forward to it . 
  i still get the feeling that you 're excusing people who targeted foreigners out of racism . 
  so simple question : were these attacks okay ? 
  do n't bother , he 's clearly a complete moron . 
  have n't read such a stupid comment in a long time ...  there is no middle ground . 
  lol, 
   so much for ignorance ...  revenge is good . 
  yeah buddy , you 're not better than him . 
  probably does n't fit the definition of progrom but the nsu is definitely a clear sign that right-wing extremism is very much alive in germany . 
  yeah that 's not what you wrote though , you were suggesting that the attacks were justified because the police `` does n't protect the people '' , were n't you ? 
   of course , try to prove any of this . 
  probably difficult to prove because it 's based on one video spread by a right-wing site . 
  the protesters also were n't peaceful , they threw bottles and firecrackers at the police and were warned three times ti stop doing that , they did n't so the police acted . 
  it 's pretty straight forwards , no ? 
  88 is definitely a thing in the german neo-nazi scene , i think this is global . 
  i have n't heard of the `` 14 '' part but i 'm also not an expert on this , haha . 
   vigilante justice has to be expected no it really has n't , the people who attacked the pakistanis are racist assholes and deserve some jail time . 
  how can you excuse this blatant attack ? 
  no this is a issue with racism and xenophobia . 
  these people were attacked because of their race , not because some people wanted to make trouble . 
  what the fuck man , you 're making it seem like this was n't a planned attack motivated by racism/xenophobia . 
  and you 're sitting at +154 ? 
  this subreddit is a complete shithole , holy shit . 
  oh boy , another american who thinks that everything around the world works just like in the us . 
  nazi code , 88 refers to the 8th letter of the alphabet `` h '' , 88 = hh = `` heil hitler '' 14 is not very common in germany ( at least i had to google what it refers to ) . 
  it 's connected to 14 words - \u201e we must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children `` which is actually a us neo-nazi thing , david eden lane said that apparently . 
  but maybe / u/stwic meant 18 , which `` translates '' to ah , adolf hitler . 
   yeah , ok 6 pakistanis getting beat up is n't a good thing . 
  i have the feeling that you actually think it 's a good thing . 
  the incident rightfully gets attention and you labeling it as not news worthy is pretty disgusting . 
   i 'm actually truly baffled about how you arrived at such an idiotic conclusion . 
  it 's the usual right-wing rhetoric , pretty apparent when someone posts  yeah , ok 6 pakistanis getting beat up is n't a good thing . 
   the scene which just happened in cologne would never have happened in the us , because american police have zero tolerance for that type of behavior . 
  i do n't agree to that , this can happen pretty much anywhere . 
  it 's just people who used a large crowd , darkness and confusion to commit various crimes ( as of now i 'm aware of one reported rape , 15 cases of sexual invasion and various cases of theft ) . 
  why do you think could n't this happen at mardi gras for example , that 's pretty naive i 'd say ? 
  the police fucked up , that 's fairly sure i 'd say , why could n't the police fuck up the same way ? 
  police fuck ups are n't really a rare thing in the us . 
  ah right , since it 's suicides and gang-related there 's nothing to worry about . 
  and i totally forgot guns per captia as well which totally makes it okay that 147 people died . 
  anyways , i should 've qouted what 's more relevant here , the rape rates . 
  turns out you 're not better off in the us , three times as many rates as in germany : http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/crime/rape-rate, 
   and the news was suppressed in germany no it was n't . 
  the media has reported about it starting january 1st . 
  why do you spew such bullshit ? 
   way better off then america . 
  ...  nobody was talking about america ... 
  i 'm not saying that it was definitely a polish accent , i ca n't evaluate it myself and it 's easy to mishear it . 
  just calling out how ridiculous armchair experts evaluate the events in cologne when it 's not clear yet what exactly happened . 
  why ot skip to a million instead , saves us all time . 
  still very different from a fucking thousand like many people claim here . . 
   way better off then america . 
  [ lol , right ... ] ( http://www.vocativ.com/news/267453/guns-have-already-killed-at-least-147-people-in-2016/ ), 
  nope , 1000 people in general by the train station , regular people , tourists and varying numbers ( between 2-3 and 20 according to eye witnesses ) of criminals . 
  i do n't see the necessity for that . 
  but they 're not and this is what you get with gun culture , wackos with weapons . 
  no thanks , we 're better off than the us the way it 's now . 
  do n't think so bud , but anyways , guns do n't make societies safer . 
  we 're 5 days into the new year and [ 147 people ] ( http://www.vocativ.com/news/267453/guns-have-already-killed-at-least-147-people-in-2016/ ) have been killed by guns in the us . 
  do n't want that , do n't need that . 
  and it wo n't be different in 20 years . 
  alrighty , misjudged it then . 
  i 'm calling you out for your bullshit , there 's nothing like what you described in germany , so piss off with that bullshit . 
  [ you 're not even from germany ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3vep8m/movie_theater_goers_of_reddit_have_you_ever/cxnj1x1 ) which is especially ridiculous . 
  good for you , but not everyone has this insurance in the us . 
  no i 'm not , you seemed suprised that there were refugees two years ago , or did i read that wrong ? 
   ( up to 30 if i remember right if they are students or trainees . ) . 
  it 's 25 actually, 
  right , that 's when you 'll get the really weird looks . 
  right and the numbers reported by eye witnesses range from 2-3 people to 20 people who did the actual crimes , certainly not all 1000 of them . 
  they could be but they 'd quickly be rejected . 
  yeah but you also need that right much more in the us than in germany . 
   treasonous rebels i do n't see any treason in their actions but that word gets thrown around a lot in the us it seems , they 're rather domestic terrorist . 
  and sorry , but i do n't think anyone would want them here , we do n't need gun wielding wackos , be them americans or germans . 
  very well . 
  i 'm sorry but i ca n't answer your question regarding cologne but cctv cameras are not that usual in germany , we have a strong privacy culture . 
  but there could be some at the central train station , usually more there . 
  but it 'll be difficult to asses the recordings , too many people in a confined space , too dark and fireworks everywhere . 
  but we 'll have to see . 
   they should just imprison the scum as members of a criminal organisation yay for [ sippenhaft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sippenhaft ) , just imprison everyone . 
  are you under the assumption that there were no refugees in 2013 ? 
  ah r/europe , where people can safely judge a not fully investigated event by reading a headline but it 's impossible for one person to detect a polish accent . 
  this place has really become a dump . 
  yeah we need militias , i heard there 's one in oregon that will be free in a few days , might lending us them ? 
  that 's bullshit as well , stop talking out of your ass . 
   it 's reached the point where women in a non islamic country have to obey sharia law and where would that be ? 
  we really do n't need more surveillance , no thanks . 
   the evil right wingers said this would be a problem , so they can not ever acknowledge it . 
  just to make this clear : it 's unlikely that there were many if any refugees involved if that 's what you wanted to imply here . 
  nope it was n't , russia annexed crimea . 
  much appretiated , thanks !, 
  well that seems reputable . 
  i did n't want to question you per se but i just was n't aware that merkels approval ratings dropped that much , she had around 60 % approval last time i checked . 
  germany has a -6 % score for merkel ? 
  any source on who conducted the survey , iirc she still has a pretty high approval in germany . 
  edit : i found a -1 % score in [ novembers * deutschlandtrend * ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/deutschlandtrend-437~magnifier_pos-2.html ) and a +4 score in [ decembers deutschlandtrend ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_ard-deutschlandtrend_dezember2015_3_764237f426.png ) so this is n't off by much . 
  did n't know that her favourability dropped that much to be honest . 
  no '' so no sarcasm , '' / s '' . 
  that 's not what happened though , was it ?
