  probably especially the google.nl results that pushed this . 
  how am i ignoring it when i 'm criticising both ? 
  of course it 's bad , but conventional slaughter is n't really better . 
  it 's like claiming that you 're better because you 're fucking 12 year olds when the others fuck 10 year olds . 
  maybe do n't do either . 
  you 're puzzlng me . 
  yeah right , that 's exactly what i 'm saying / s. 
  my point is that regular meat eaters ca n't really claim any high ground . 
  `` oh look , we 're killing the animals so much better than you , they only suffer bad , not * really bad * '' . 
  such a ridiculous argument . 
  i was just trying to explain why the statement does n't equal support of this treatment , at least from a logical standpoint . 
   if your book says violence is ok against gay people or non-believers , then it 's a crappy book . 
  we can definitely agree on that . 
  nope , rather take a look at your own actions before you criticise others , especially if what you do is not really better . 
  killing animals is deplorable , no matter how you do it . 
  and you 're trying to avoid an uncomfortable reality by shushing someone who has a very valid point . 
  sure it is . 
  does the bible support ill treatment of homosexuals * ? 
  sure does . 
  do i support it ? 
  certainly not . 
  * sorry , do n't know what the bible actually says on this but you 'll get the gist . 
  i was being ironic in case you missed that , germany , spain and other countries were experiencing a similar situation . 
  i do n't want to brush it off as a statistical anomaly , i 'm just saying that it is n't normal !, 
   obviously it is n't a normal , everyday occurance , but what 's your point ? 
  ** this ** , only this . 
  op implied it was normal , that 's bullshit . 
  that 's my whole message . 
   seeing a terrorist attack in news is nowadays more disappointing than it is shocking . 
  oh come on ... 
  thanks , you too , 
  yeah but my argument is that - following your climate change analogy - it 's more like u/peczko saying that climate change is n't real because it 's been cold the last two years and it 's normal that it 's cold . 
  such small trends can not be seen as `` something becoming normal '' . 
  terrorism is n't normal , at least not in europe . 
  try telling a israeli or iraqi that terrorism is a normal , every day thing in europe . 
  then you should provide a chart of that and not a chart of * all * terrorist attacks of the world . 
  if boko haram is killing nigerian kids than their attack does n't target europe , no ? 
  worst back paddeling ever , haha . 
  this includes the whole world , i thought we were in r/europe and hence discussing europe , no ? 
  what am i wrong about ? 
  your `` harmless comment '' is nothing but fear mongering . 
  terrorism is n't normal and it does n't happen on the regular basis that you 're implying . 
  generally means that it 's a larger trend and it did n't increase in the last decade , around 10 years ago there were more attacks/victims for a start . 
  you 're still falling for terrorism though by seeing it as `` something normal '' when it really is n't . 
  it does n't happen every day and not even every week . 
  you 're being ridiculous , sorry . 
  still a pretty stupid statement since terrorism is generally declining . 
  you know what also helps terrorism ? 
  people falling for terrorism by being overly afraid . 
  yeah , i really dread the 70 's and 80 's when terrorism was pretty much unheard of in europe . 
  not tor guard , but tor . 
  tor will work even better , is completely free and will anonymize you too . 
  i know one thing that 's braindead for sure . 
  no , you dumbass . 
  this thought is actually contradictory to the basic principles of science . 
  let people explore all fields , do what you 're interested in and shut up !, 
  and implies that only these scientific fields matter , which is ridiculous . 
   the onus is on your lot to first make an argument , before i can disprove any of it . 
  not really given that you started the discussion . 
   because op has n't even presented an argument , instead they have thrown out some vague claims . 
  what ? 
  op has given a pretty good explanation and you just replied saying `` uhuuum no '' , * you * did n't have any argument . 
  anyways , not going to debate someone like you , it 's a waste of time . 
   i have disproven gp 's claim that gender theory has nothing to do with queer theory , yeah , this is the gotcha part . 
  / u/acrasie said that gender theory does not ** equal ** queer theory and you `` disproved '' their point by saying `` uhuum but it 's a part of it '' . 
  wow . ', 
   also it is obvious to anyone that is not a delusional leftist activist that beliefs such as these are mainstream only within narrow ideological bubbles . 
   feel free to put forward an actual argument . 
  how about you start with that , you 're attacking the field without anything to back it up , you 're just throwing shit . 
  no point in continuing this . 
  this is a gotcha reply that does n't really disprove anything , pretty ironic that you present yourself as a defender of science though . 
  lol only stem amiright ? 
  that 's a bit confusing though , on the one hand you argue that everything was rushed and on the other you say that the government should 've taken more control . 
  anyways , what has been done ca n't be undone . 
  the only time where this might be relevant is with north and south korean unification , although that is a hell of another beast and will probably take 10 times more effort . 
   but i do understand , that there was this one time opportunity for reunification , and it was hard to tell at the time , for how long it was really open . 
  yup , i think this was the reason why things were a little bit rushed . 
   i 'm just a little bit hesitant to buy the `` official '' narrative of the events unconditionally . 
  what `` narrative '' ? 
  probably cheaper and easier than finding a hotel and i 've heard similar stories , yup . 
  yeah that too and if you 're delayed by  2h you can get a partial refund , if you have to stay over night they have to provide a hotel . 
  you really ca n't though , it is our constitution and it is valid . 
  everything else are weird conspiracy theories based on naming technicalities and wrong facts . 
  i like db for the most part , definitely could be better though but imho the most comfortable form of traveling and if you book smart you will get your connection 90 % of the time . 
   i could have lived with two german states , if people had equal rights and freedoms . 
  i ca n't imagine that would 've worked . 
  look at the economic differences alone and very little experience with democracy , that 's a state that would 've been waiting to fail in some form or another . 
  i most definitely do n't think that , haha . 
  * i love myself a beer , must be my irish drunktard heritage . 
  boy do i love my rich cultural background , i know so much about how it is to be irish with their drinking and all . 
  would love to visit london one day !, 
  yeah probably not , it 's about 14 \u00b0 c and raining here which is n't really cold but the temparature suddenly dropped so it feels colder than that . 
   and rutte can not into merkel is that really something you 'd desire ? 
  no worries , neither ist mein , just gave me a chuckle  greeting to mexico from fucking freezing ( not really , but feels this way at least ) germany :d, 
  neither drugs nor that , it 's a standard phrase in most lonely planet guides and in there for countries where you need to say this because it 's not certain that you 'll get a clean syringe , read : devoloping countries , not the netherlands . 
  i 'd wager that most germans are n't fond of that sterotype because it does n't even represent bavaria very good , pretty much no-one wears lederhosen in real life , oktoberfest are two weeks of the year that have more vistors from the rest of the globe than germans and people who can dance schuhplattler are not very common either . 
  but noone will really lose their mind over it , we 'll just laugh and explain that that 's only a thing in germany 's texas . 
  yeah what an absolute asshole ... 
   spanyard should n't you rather identify as spanmeter . 
  does n't keep muricans from claiming they 're irish just because their great-great-grandfather once farted in the general direction of cork .
