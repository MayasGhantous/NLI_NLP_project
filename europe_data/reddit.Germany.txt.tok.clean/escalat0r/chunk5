  i think the most outsatnding fact about italian food is that a large group of people can agree that it 's good food . 
  some people like mexican food and some do n't , some * love * japanese food while i can really not get into it . 
  but i have n't met many people who said that they did n't like italian food . 
  * plus * you can eat genuine italian food and will still like it , many cuisines will get changed to fit the taste of a country , thai food will be siginficantly less spicy in europe for example . 
  you 're an allstar, 
   kaiserschmarrn kaiserschmarrn is seriously one of the greatest achievements of mankind , love that stuff . 
  fell free to take bayern , fucking conservative trouble makers . 
  [ ^ ^ welthauptstadt ^ ^ germania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welthauptstadt_germania ) ^ ^ anyone ? 
  they 'd probably portray it as a sea of piss . 
   but can you give a source on germany 's reluctance ? 
  i 'm still in the process of figuring this out , i just read it today and was quite puzzled because most of the other sources that i read stated the adenauer was in general not really anglophobe ( unlike de gaulle ) , something like the eu would probably be his dream , his goals were mainly ensuring peace and maintaining/acquiring a strong position for negotiations with the su for his goal to restore germany . 
  just checked again and it actually states that adenauer did n't want to include the uk in a european political union ( there were talks about the formation of a european politican union between 1958 and 1961 - [ fouchet plans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fouchet_plan ) ) and apparently adenauer did n't want the uk to be part of that , for whatever reason . 
  all these plans failed because especially france had so deviating opinions from the rest of the eec ( benelux , italy , germany ) and it kind of reads like a fight in kindergarten . 
  each side proposes a vision for a epu , the other sides reject them and proposes them , it gets rejected and the other side proposes pretty much the exact same thing . 
  the source are notes from a former ambassador to paris , [ josef jansen ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_jansen ) , what i read is a summary by thomas jansen which i suppose is his son . 
  it 's so weird , i 'm just writing a paper on the [ \u00c9lys\u00e9e treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lys%c3%a9e_treaty ) ( treaty of friendship between france and germany for cooperation in different fields ) and around this time it was the uk who wanted to be a part of the [ eec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_community ) ( european economic community ) and france and partly germany ( mostly chancelor adenauer ) were against them joining . 
  nowadays it 's the brits that want less integration and all that jazz and france and especially germany wants to convince everyone that more integration is the way to go . 
  but many german politicians campaigned for germany to take a stance for the inclusion of the uk , which caused that a pramble was added to the treaty that stated this stance , which i 'm glad about , de gaulle had some very strong ideas . 
  hope you enjoyed your stay in germany , what did you do ? 
  romania is still definitely on a way and i do n't know too much about it but i hope that you simply continue with this progress . 
  i wrote my first report in uni on the integration of romania and bulgaria into the eu and their development alongside what the eu demanded . 
  i found that romania was doing much better , getting rid of corruption and many other improvements . 
  i hope i can visit soon , romania seems like a fascinating and beautiful country !, 
  yup , un resolution 1973, 
  technically maybe but the us was also technically at war with germany only 24 years ago . 
  on paper that is , hitler and stalin never thought about taking the hitler-stalin pact as a series collaboration . 
  this is an important remark , no country is really peaceful until they stop producing and selling weapons . 
  i found that weird when i saw the post on / r/dataisbeautiful ( ? 
  ) , iirc german penises are even above average in europe although i 'm not sure if i 'd trust these statistics . 
  and i 'm also not sure why i 'm rambling about germans dick lenght here . 
  maybe i should seek help . 
  or enlarge my penis . 
  or both . 
  would n't austrians just be cheating then , measuring their dick from tip to chin ? 
  haha , i hope i did n't creep you out , 
  good old l-street * , only about 5 walking minutes to the next lidl , i see , i see  weird to see someone in / r/europe that lives about 5 minutes away from you . 
  this is [ my view ] during that thunderstorm a few days ago . 
  * not sure if that 's correct and shortened for your privacys sake . 
  i really like this one , 
  few people know that istanbul is actually one of the most expensive cities when it comes to housing . 
  i really like these , nice design and it does n't look that intimidating . 
  probably because the danish police really is n't but will try to sort things out through a conversation . 
  at least that 's my stereotype . 
  you can always count on bavaria to want the * extra sausage * . 
  not sure if this is intended to be a pole joke ... 
  oh god i 'm dying , haha . 
  fuck you , your opinion is wrong !, 
  it 's so weird , for me reindeers look * kind of * like magical creatures and for you it 's probably not at all uncommon . 
  hope i can visit northern europe soon , 
  i think that 's not too expensive given that this is probably what you pay for a small coffee in oslo . 
  also if you 're in the midwest us and not married yet . 
  that 's why i wrote * securing * , maybe * keeping it up * or * maintaining * are better words . 
  haha , you 'll * definitelly * have the same in germany , probably even more . 
  the eu is about more than just being an institution for already wealthy countries to enhance their wealth , for me it 's ultimatively about securing peace in europe . 
  you were in bavaria i assume ? 
  even there you 'll get a decent pils . 
  two answers - both regarding beer . 
  i 'd rather take the better education system although beer is a neat thing . 
  let 's just hope that it wo n't take long for these states to pass by russia in this map . 
  really refreshing to see a pro-eu brit . 
  what would you say is better in germany than in norway ? 
  here is how it 's calculated : [ t ] he hdi combines three dimensions : a long and healthy life : life expectancy at birth education index : mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling a decent standard of living : gni per capita ( ppp us$ ) in its 2010 human development report , the undp began using a new method of calculating the hdi . 
  the following three indices are used : 1 . 
  life expectancy index 2 . 
  education index 2.1 mean years of schooling index 2.2 expected years of schooling index 3 . 
  income index https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index#dimensions_and_calculation ___ so you look at three things , 1 ) life expectancy does n't vary that much , the us ranks at # 35 , many/most european countries rank higher . 
  2 ) i think this is kind of weird , more years of school/education do n't automatically equal better education . 
  some german states recently switched from 9 years of higher education to 8 , this would result in a negative hdi impact although you ca n't conclude that german children will receive not as good education as before . 
  of course this also features university education . 
  3 ) income is probably where the us really scores , they [ rank almost exclusively among the top 5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage ) , although that 's * average * income not * median * income . 
  this number is obviously to be taken with a grain of salt since the us also has many people in the top income category , namely [ 492 billionaires ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_the_number_of_us_dollar_billionaires ) . 
  glad to hear that not everyone buys into that stereotype , although it 's pretty harmless and i definitely do n't mind if people say it jokingly . 
  i agree with you , germans are mostly funny people but it 's also definitely true that we have an extra large number of people who take life too seriously , we could learn something in this regard from the balkan people , 
  i was rather poking fun at the stereotype of germans not having humor :p, 
  ah okay , i thought it was supposed to sound like something funny in english , thanks for explaining , 
  \u00e5tta - sju - six , spoken * otta - sch\u00fc - six * . 
  i do n't get it , can you explain ? 
   there 's nothing glorious about that . 
    the whole thing is just a joke . 
  ca n't expect a german to get a joke though . 
  do n't forget switzerland . 
  may be a little late but just as an fyi : this is a known troll in here and in / r/de, 
  arguably just as shitty but i 'll give it a try . 
  not sure , you could develop one yourself or ask someone in the community to do it . 
  or you can just avoid spon alltogether . 
  haha , do n't worry . 
  here 's the link : https://youtube.adblockplus.me/, 
  you can use ad block to block the whole comment section , works pretty well . 
  consider yourself lucky , we have the whole of bavaria to deal with * shudder * . 
  i 'm not going to jump into that dutch discussion , but does n't pretty much every country have a small amount of hate for their countryside , which is most often more conservative and all that jazz . 
  it 's probably just jaden smith 's alt account  how can ukraine be real , if europe is n't real . 
  your fault for naming it zagreb , all hail the wonderful * aa * chen , number one on any list of cities in alphabetical order . 
  that paintshop makes it fucking ugly . 
  i do n't get that joke , it 's not like they 're used as door stopper or to buld dams , why would n't you choose a reliable car as the thing you make money with every day ? 
  ah i though you meant `` kommentare '' i.e. 
  opinion articles . 
  well if we took these comments seriously we 's also castrate or kill child molesters , they 're pretty much garbage and that 's the reason why they 're so extreme , because level minded people avoid it . 
  in german newspapers ? 
  can you quote what you 're referencing here ? 
  he mentions in the video that this has n't been the first time they did this , yes .
