it would be self-defeating , they wo n't bankrupt the airport as a whole by taking a large chunk of what they have . 
  they might hold a share of the current company 's profits and the canadians could sue the original ( german ) owners . 
  i 'm under the impression that the commenter above wrote about how scams work in general . 
  in this case the company did not want to pay the vat the tax office said they had to pay . 
  their books were cooked ( missing vat payments ) and they looked good abroad . 
  it 's as if i claim that i should n't pay what the state wants from me and pretend that everything is fine . 
  hochtief sucks and i 'm not the only german in this thread that believes so . 
  also note that the 600 millions include fines and interest . 
  still has a point though . 
  it 's been 4 weeks , years have passed without doing anything at all . 
  it was a german company for the duration of their contract with greece . 
  see other comments below , the subsidiary is canadian-owned since 2013 . 
  i agree . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/comments/2hrrab/commissionersdesignate_european_parliament/ ), 
  i 'm glad you like landscapes . 
  the other day i was also [ downvoted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zm85j/physical_andor_sexual_partner_violence_since_the/cfuxc5r ) to hell for stating the obvious . 
  you people have to learn to read . 
  it 's about ** an invitation ** . 
  not about being sexually aroused in general and subsequently asking someone out . 
  case 1 . 
  john is aroused by mary . 
  john is polite and asks mary out . 
  mary accepts . 
  john and mary have sex . 
  this is normal . 
  case 2 . 
  john is aroused by mary . 
  john tells mary that he likes the way she swings her juicy ass and that he is mesmerized by her bouncing tits . 
  he also tells mary that he wants them to grab a bite and then go to his place to get down and dirty . 
  john is mary 's boss and tells that to her on a daily basis . 
  mary is afraid that she 'll lose her job . 
  what 's the difference in this story ? 
  ** john is a jerk and mary is the victim . 
  of course these are reports from women , they explained that . 
  in general women are afraid and ashamed to report violence against them . 
  so the situation might be worse than shown in the survey . 
  women are reluctant but not stupid . 
  never change , / r/europe , never change . 
  it always must be a feminist conspiracy !, 
  the map is about physical and sexual violence . 
  you 're questioning the whole study because in a part of the study you do n't understand how some ** inappropriate invitations ** might be harassament ? 
  you do understand that there are appropriate and inappropriate remarks , do you ? 
  it 's not about asking a woman out . 
  if you ask a woman to go out with you because she has a sweet ass and you want to tap that after dinner it 's fucking inappropriate . 
  it might surprise you but some people do n't get it . 
  this is what this section covers . 
  jerks , employees that are afraid they 'll lose their job and things like that . 
  they follow a specific methodology and focus on specific jurisdictions , read the [ faq ] ( http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/faq ) . 
  i have the feeling he does n't refer to what happened with the girl but to stealing , trafficking etc. 
  destitution is a hotbed for crimes and does n't care about heritage . 
  remember [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/19v6xt/poll_do_you_find_anything_wrong_with_the_choices/ ) ? 
  i 'm not much online lately , but i now go [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europeans/ ) and do n't miss much , it only needs more people to discover it . 
   lol , i love this faux-democratic fa\u00e7ade you 're putting on here . 
  it suits you . 
  my democratic credentials are not a matter for you to judge . 
   meanwhile , you closed the poll long before a reasonable number of people had the chance to vote . 
  i.e. , i missed it completely due to actually being at work this morning . 
  the people voting after the update , which was made when the post was about to vanish from the front page , actually make the numbers a bit worse for the mods . 
   leading questions it appears that you are in the minority that feels that way . 
  in any case , your opinion was noted . 
   i did not consider people 's nationality when i picked the mods . 
  but you argued about native english speakers and visibility in activity . 
  are these people from china or from the uk ? 
  look , i 'll repeat it again . 
  i 'm not saying that you plotted to do this . 
  i 'm saying that in the end , your choices demonstrate that cultural affinity played an important role . 
  it did n't just happen to end up with 67 % of mods from the uk and us in / r/europe . 
   i recommend you ask the newly added mods to check for any evidence of inproper behaviour now , in the past or in the future , and see what they say . 
  ask our chosen ones if they are good chosen ones , or if those that chose them are good ? 
  what are we , 12-year-olds ? 
  sorry , i do n't have anything else to add , your actions speak for themselves . 
  if you want to follow my suggestions then you 're free to do so . 
  this is the definition of cherry-picking . 
  we 're discussing a specific aspect of your choices here . 
  what the heck , forget about it . 
  i 've said what i had to say and it seems that you are unable to comprehend it , although there 's no language barrier . 
  you just disagreed with yourself , because you chose people that were not active here , or were being less active than others . 
  also , there is a large difference in the quality of contributions between active users . 
  so , if you 're being downvoted it is not because people do n't agree with your choices , but your choices could be supported by the amount of anonymous upvotes of self-nominees . 
  what kind of logic is this ? 
  you would drive [ bertrand russell ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bertrand_russell ) mad . 
   our evil anti-german bias really , this is what you understood from what i wrote until now ? 
  try to substitute german with another nationality in my example above . 
  / u/pappenheimer was not nominated . 
  if you want to fix this , reduce the number of british mods , replace self-nominees , and be geographically diverse . 
  i do n't give a single eurocent about german or martian mods . 
  i want people that are active in this community and were nominated by other people active in this community . 
   / u/span12 must have deleted his comment . 
  as i said , i have no way to examine thoroughly what happened back then , but let 's accept what you say . 
   on an english-language website most of the active and known mods are native english speakers . 
  this is insulting . 
  it 's not a website for the anglosphere , it 's a multicultural and multilingual community using english as the lingua franca . 
  further , it 's not / r/anglosphereandfriends but / r/europe . 
  see the map and tell me if mods choices reflect european realities . 
  the vast majority of non-native speakers here are perfectly able to communicate in english . 
  i 'm not saying that you 're necessarily biased , but it is pretty clear that you have the tendency to pick people you 're familiar with , linguistically and culturally . 
  this is equally bad . 
   i have no problem with self-nomination . 
  their nominations were upvoted and no-one pointed out any major problems in the comments . 
  that was good enough for me .
