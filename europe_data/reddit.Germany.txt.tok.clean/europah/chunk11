  http://www.canada.com/news/serb+fisherman+keeps+watch+over+danube+saving+people+from+suicide/7318377/story.html this new link only briefly mentions the fisherman story , and goes on with more data about depression and suicides . 
  because we might be looking at a few more wars , many things are at stake for europe . 
  well , some of us read it just now . 
  you did n't understand . 
  the savile issue will now be inside a bigger pile of paedophile shit . 
  now , tories will be in the frontpages , not bbc . 
  and what should we do , legislate differently for muslims , christians , pagans , scientologists etc ? 
  everyone should learn to live in a civil society and accept diversity . 
  what i got is that they are not ready because they are not ready to face new big challenges , as their party 's percentages just skyrocketed . 
  as a side note , if someone is not ready he does n't sign up for the job unless if he is irresponsible . 
  i never tell my customers that i can do something i am not able to do . 
  what is this ? 
  a bbc/newsnight attempt to divert attention after the savile scandal ? 
  i know , right ? 
  they have no clue . 
  every price will go waaayyy up , and every price will be rounded upwards !, 
  that 's roughly $ 0,75 per day from every person in the eu , or $ 274 per year . 
  that was fast . 
  yup , a vw golf .

  as an outsider from the german inquisition , i see it perfectly in context . 
  he says that they are not ready , they wo n't lie like the other parties , but they are trying to be ready in the future , if the people elect them in government . 
  so papandreou wanted to ask his people if they wanted a new loan , in exchange for a new austerity program , but merkel and sarkozy did not let him . 
  then papandreou had to find an excuse and said that the referendum would not be for the loan , but for euro membership , because he knew that greeks would vote yes . 
  then he resigned and there was no referendum . 
  the deal went through with papademos , a non-elected pm . 
  democracy . 
   in finland you do n't have to prove anything , you only need to show your social security card that card is linked with government databases and proves who you are . 
  that 's why you show it . 
  i do n't know how you do it , you 've said politely the same thing a million times to jrohila and he still does n't get it . 
  jesus , you describe all these administrative procedures above and you wonder why other countries also have them ? 
  budget allocation falls from the sky ? 
  payments fall from the sky ? 
  contributions happen by themselves ? 
  do n't you have to prove who you are in finland ? 
  do n't you have to fill applications ? 
  does everything happen with the power of thought in finland ? 
  krattr describes what happens with people that do not work . 
  they might be homeless or whatever . 
  someone has to verify who they are and if they are really poor , in order to receive these benefits . 
  there is only one option saying `` no religion / atheist '' . 
  it does n't fit there ; agnosticism does n't deny , nor accepts religious beliefs . 
  it 's simply another state . 
  the `` other '' option is still not suitable , because agnosticism can not be grouped with other religious beliefs . 
  i think that if some beliefs that are considered minor , statistically , are represented , then agnostics ought to have an option , too . 
   you either have a religion or you do n't . 
   every agnostic is in the end either a theist \u039d\u03bf . 
   or an atheist no . 
  is it that difficult to understand that being agnostic is about not following either choice , because there is n't sufficient proof for either case ? 
  it seem that on reddit it is . 
  darwin was an agnostic , curie was an agnostic , sagan was an agnostic , tyson is an agnostic . 
  it 's a different category . 
  it 's not about being with one group , deists or atheists , in the end . 
  i think that i do , but on reddit there is a skewed view of agnosticism . 
  it 's not a state that fits in any other option . 
  anirdnas and other people also understand the difference . 
  tyson and sagan also understand the difference . 
  i also think that we should all follow the reddiquette . 
  seconds after my replies , you add a comment and i get a downvote . 
  i 'd like to believe that it does n't come from a moderator . 
   suspending judgment on whether to believe still means you do n't believe . 
  this is where most people get it wrong . 
  it 's not a matter of belief . 
  you do n't suspend judgment , you claim that you are ignorant because there is n't enough proof for either case . 
  you do n't claim that you know that deities exist , and you do n't claim that you know that deities do not exists . 
  also read the sagan quote i added above . 
   agnosticism is not a recognised religion , therefore you should select `` no religion '' . 
  thank you for your suggestion , but it seems that you do n't understand what agnosticism is . 
  it does n't fit in any other option . 
  the survey asks for `` religious belief '' and agnosticism is a unique state that is not included . 
  atheism is . 
  reddit has got it wrong on the atheism/agnosticism difference . 
  i explained it here . 
  it 's not the same thing . 
  it 's a different state . 
  [ i just explained it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1229f8/official_reurope_member_survey/c6rozel ) . 
  90 % if not 99 % of people who think that agnosticism and atheism are in essence the same thing , are young / r/atheism subscibers that misunderstood what the terms really mean . 
  i 'm not saying that you 're one of them , i 'm just saying that reddit has got it wrong here . 
  agnosticism is * by definition * the state of not knowing . 
  you do n't claim * gnosis * ( knowledge ) about anything . 
  agnostics are not deists or atheists , the just do n't * know * if supreme beings exist . 
  they listen to all arguments , but since there is no proof for anything , they claim that they are ignorant . 
  i think it 's the most honest scientific stance . 
  listen to neil degrasse tyson . 
  i 'm on the same boat . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czsmc5rwvos ** edit ** people , if you think that you 're better than tyson , i 'd like to see your work . 
  let me also offer something from carl sagan . 
   when i say i 'm an agnostic , i only mean that the evidence is n't in . 
  there is n't compelling evidence that god exists -- at least your kind of god -- and there is n't compelling evidence that he does n't . 
  contact : a novel ( 1995 ) , page 175, 
  it 's neither , that 's why it should be offered as a separate choice . 
  how many of us participated in the program ? 
  i 'm one of them . 
  oh , the memories . 
  our debts to txampion , / r/europe 's resident troll , can never be repaid !, 
  ca n't do it , you did n't let us agnostics in . 
  agnostics are not atheists . 
  averages do not tell the real story , just take a loot at satellite maps to understand the us mosaic . 
  as for the two coasts , some states do better than the others . 
  estonia fares better because smaller scale projects are easier to deal with .
