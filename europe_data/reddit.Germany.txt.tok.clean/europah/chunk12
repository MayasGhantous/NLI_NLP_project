  the euro is a young currency and manages to survive even during a huge crisis . 
  give it another 10 years and you 'll see why the pound will be irrelevant then . 
  their economies will start growing in 2014 and their house will be in order . 
   illegal migrants/asylum seekers from non european countries coming to uk through europe they wo n't end up in the uk , unless if they fall from the sky . 
  ** edit ** people , you missed the point . 
  read what op wrote again . 
   unlike europe uk does n't issue national id card to its citizens but passport and uk does n't want to deal with the illegal migrants/asylum seekers from non european countries coming to uk through europe then read what i wrote . 
   they wo n't end up in the uk , unless if they fall from the sky . 
  what is the issue we 're discussing ? 
  the consequences of uk `` s participation in the schengen zone . 
  will this change the patterns of illegal immigration ? 
  ** the uk will not be the first point of entry . 
  ** britain is an island and the uk shares a land border only with the republic of ireland , which is also an island . 
  illegal immigration exists everywhere , and will continue to exist as long as there are humans in poor or war-torn countries . 
  participation in the schengen zone wo n't change that . 
  my point is that the number of illegal immigrants coming ** from europe ** wo n't change . 
  the authorities of the uk will still be able to look for illegal immigrants . 
  enough with that scaremongering . 
  the only country that has a big problem is greece , because it has thousands of islands and turkey turns a blind eye on illegal immigration . 
  i see the eurozone as a way to avert [ black wednesday ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday ) - type events . 
  these tests are a polite way of saying no . 
  test 2 will always fail in the eyes of the uk , because uk would always argue it is more flexible for them to have their own currency . 
  this is not the case , they 're just bowing to city .

   berlin ( dpa ) - one in 20 people in germany are unable to pay bills on time or skip meals due to poverty , data released on tuesday showed , as the european union takes stock of its progress on poverty . 
   around 5.3 per cent of the population live in deprivation , defined by european statisticians as being too poor to pay the rent on time , to eat meat at least every second day or to buy a car , washing machine or colour television . 
   including those at serious risk of poverty , the figure rises to 12.8 million people , or 15.8 per cent of the german population , according to data released a week ago , despite their country ` s strong economic growth . 
   german statisticians interviewed a cross-section of 13,500 households last year to ask what they can afford and discover if incomes from work , welfare and pensions suffice . 
   poverty was defined as meeting at least four of nine criteria . 
   the data was fed into an eu-wide survey of social progress in 2011 , but the comparative picture from other member states was not yet available . 
   although germany so far has been less affected by the recession that has hit much of the eurozone , its poorest have seen little benefit from economic growth . 
  chancellor angela merkel last week voiced alarm that the poor lack adequate pension plans for old age . 
   germany ` s definition of poverty is well above the world bank and un definition of having less than 1.25 dollars daily to live . 
   anti-poverty campaigners say the german poor may not starve , but they suffer from outcast status and lower life expectancy .

  estonia is advanced in many ways , because they 're a close-knit society having the advantage of small scale and adaptability . 
  as for the us , there are some states that are more progressive than the rest , such as california . 
  there are also many people that are more progressive than the rest . 
  we 're having this discussion on reddit 's platform . 
  but the roots of the problem in the us are burried deep . 
  in the course of getting rid of the british , these immigrants developed their own sense of exceptionalism . 
  the size and the relative geographical isolation of the country makes this difficult to change . 
  in europe , diversity derives from coexistence . 
  in the us , diversity is the short period between landing and getting your green card . 
  as a us citizen , you hold some constitutional principles as self-evident truths , although in reality some of them are chains , holding your society back . 
  europe has its own problems with crazies too , but most people accept some basic modern political , social , and scientific principles . 
  this is because we have many different nations , speaking many different languages , trying many different working models for their societies . 
  i will take the unified but diverse model over the melting pot model any day . 
  us is a backwards country in many ways , but keep in mind that estonia is flat and small . 
  geography is a bitch for transport and networks . 
  the culture is different too . 
  americans fear anything related to the federal government , and this makes it much more difficult to harmonize decisions and policies across all states . 
  am i the only northerner that got the sarcasm ? 
  that 's very good news , good job indeed . 
  now we should * all * stop talking shit about each other and help the young and the poorest to find a path in life . 
  europe needs a few years and we 're back in business , baby . 
  usually companies have local representatives that know the local culture and make the appropriate adjustments , when necessary . 
  my comment had to do with different outlooks in life , which translate to different outlooks about how to deal with economic matters . 
  `` our people are not perfect but our culture is superior to others '' germany : 5 in 10 agree france , uk : 3 in 10 agree fml want to solve the financial crisis ? 
  start here . 
  i 'm glad it 's here , i would n't see it over there . 
  these subreddits are scary places . 
  most monitors would be from europe , it belongs to / r/europe . 
  maybe one of op 's points , because the hill is considered a serious publication . 
  socialists from un and yurop come to take our children !, 
  if the people of kosovo want to be independent , and eu accepts it , why the people of catalonia ca n't be independent ? 
  forget the highest manned ballon flight record .

  change the video quality to a lower setting . 
   scientific contribution focus  red bull stratos aims to provide information that will further the progression of aerospace safety . 
  the key benefits for the science community are as follows :  - to aid development of a new generation of space suits - including enhanced mobility and visual clarity - and other systems to lead toward passenger/crew exit from space . 
   - to aid development of protocols for exposure to high altitude/high acceleration . 
   - to aid exploration of the effects on the human body of supersonic acceleration and deceleration , including development of the latest innovations in parachute systems . 
  and to get more kids interested in science . 
  basically the post is about a youtube video in german , i just ignored the rest . 
  booing is still booing . 
  he was joking and you missed it . 
  however , the most obvious benefit is pushing the envelope . 
  it 's not just someone jumping , there are scientists behind this . 
  i do n't care who pays about it . 
  hundreds of years ago many expeditions were privately funded . 
  i do n't understand why you would have problems , if you did read the article . 
  it 's donges answering about the role of banks in the bailouts . 
  that 's the context . 
  what else would be the context ? 
  the article is in english and it has link to the original source . 
  there are reports in other languages too , for example in [ italian ] ( http://www.investireoggi.it/economia/un-consigliere-della-merkel-ammette-stiamo-salvando-la-spagna-per-salvare-le-banche-tedesche/ ) . 
  it happened . 
  live with it , it 's not the end of the world . 
  did you read the article ? 
  the context is clear . 
  did you click the links in the article ? 
  there are direct quotes . 
  this is the one that is referenced in the title . 
  overreacting much ? 
   it 's interesting how a major british newspaper mixes the european union and the european court of human rights , when those are entirely separated organisms . 
  but it 's european , so it 's bad !, 
  if he is really involved in legal proceedings , he ca n't disclose much . 
  the problem is that most people in creditor countries are not economic experts and believed the opposite .
