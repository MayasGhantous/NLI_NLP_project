  upvotes do not have usernames next to them and it 's impossible to say who * really * supported whom . 
  i could post a self-nomination and register dozens of accounts to upvote myself . 
  everyone around here is at least a bit technical . 
  but if you still want to stick with this argument , then why are you being downvoted and i 'm being upvoted in this thread ? 
  if we accept your reasoning , then i 'm right and your choices are wrong . 
  finally , this has nothing to do with being a german that wanted to see a german mod . 
  exactly . 
  it was an example . 
  if it had no influence , then you would n't seem so eager to choose more british mods and ignore german proposals , for germans or non-germans . 
  i 'm done here . 
   nationality was not a factor in who was added . 
  i 'm sorry but it does n't seem that way , because more than half of this subreddit 's mods ended up being british . 
  there is nothing wrong with being british , i 'm just saying that your choices are questionable . 
   i added / u/theskynet and / u/span12 about 2 years ago , because they were the only people who responded to a mod-post asking for new mods . 
  i have no way to check that , but let 's accept it . 
   i added / u/skuld and / u/davidreiss666 because i wanted mods i know are active in this subreddit and have a good reputation at modding . 
  and it just happened to be another british and an american ? 
   i added / u/jb _ uk , / u/gschizas , / u/bezbojnicul and / u/metaleks because they were nominated by the community / u/metaleks and / u/gschizas were self-nominated . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/196bah/reurope_new_mods_nominations/c8l8wzu  gschizas 10 days ago  i nominate myself http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/196bah/reurope_new_mods_nominations/c8l7iug  metaleks 10 days ago  i shamelessly nominate myself i wish good luck to new mods , but what happened here speaks for itself . 
  yes , it does . 
  see my comment below . 
  imagine what people would say if we had some old german mods choosing * more * german mods . 
  although the ability to moderate is not defined by one 's heritage , i do n't think that the moderator choices reflect the realities of this subreddit . 
  british mods choose other british mods and other self-nominated people . 
  i would expect a more democratic and pluralistic approach . 
  british * / u/raerth * / u/theskynet * / u/skuld ( new , not nominated ? ), 
  * / u/jb _ uk ( new , [ had hesitations about number of british mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/196bah/reurope_new_mods_nominations/c8lq5ww ) ) * / u/span12 ( british ? ), 
  american * / u/davidreiss666 ( new ) greek * / u/gschizas ( new , self-nominated ) romanian * / u/bezbojnicul ( new ) serbian * / u/metaleks ( new , self-nominated ), 
  raerth , what are the nationalities of all currently active mods , including the new ones ? 
  i 'm asking because one ca n't tell from the flags alone . 
  some search engines are also the default in browsers other than ie . 
  other oses , commercial or free , also have preinstalled browsers . 
  i do n't even use ie , but i consider this a stupid fine . 
  microsoft does n't force users to use ie , they can install whatever they want . 
  mozilla makes money off google , which has the advantage in firefox installations . 
  should n't they fine them as well ? 
  are you up for a small symbolic bet ? 
  you wrote `` this fast track to spanish citizenship includes coming over with a few million in the bank and investing a certain amount in property and business '' . 
  the loser buys the winner a month of reddit gold . 
  never tasted coca-cola . 
  i did n't like the colour as a child . 
  then i did n't like the list of ingredients . 
  am i the only one ? 
  because of the jewish bankers ' lobby , amirite ? 
  i hope you 're not serious . 
   the youth have a larger percentage of unemployment simply because they have less experience \u03a4his could be a plus , because they have fresh ideas . 
  take young people like this one and put them in suitable positions . 
   the previous poster made it seem that the problem is the fact that `` skopje [ is transforming ] into the kitsch capital of the balkans '' . 
  i did n't . 
  it 's not an issue of aesthetics . 
  they did n't build a random statue of mickey mouse . 
  what they did follows a pattern of thought and has implications .

   it is also the flipside of a much darker reality in the countries of origin of those immigrants i thought the same . 
  the brain drain has a cost . 
  in the end , it might be better * not * to be happy about them coming in hordes , because their home economies need to grow . 
   given the keenness to veto fyrom that greece has been showing thus far , and bulgaria just waiting for chances to blackmail ( every country does that ) , you 'd be still looking at at least 10 years of accession talks for macedonia . 
  right , because they are the model candidates and we ca n't see the fruits of their labour . 
  did you miss the reports on freedom of the press , treatment of homosexuals etc ? 
  the crazy plan to transform skopje into the kitsch capital of the balkans , where alexander the great meets czar samuel ? 
  / facepalm, 
  am i the only one unable to open any imgur links now ? 
  everything else works for me .

  in italian , but you see party and coalition names and percentages , it 's easy to understand what is going on .

  what is this , the eurovision song contest ? 
  joking , guys !, 
  peace be upon you . 
  a german proposed him and other germans support him . 
  that should tell you something . 
  it 's not like / r/europe will start a revolution . 
  adults have different opinions about different issues . 
  i knew that you would n't accept . 
  [ i made a nomination below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/196bah/reurope_new_mods_nominations/c8lctzc ) . 
  i have a request and i 'm sure that many will agree . 
  we should be geographically diverse when choosing new moderators . 
  i would like to see someone from the nordics and the baltics , someone from the balkans and the southeast , you get the idea . 
  seconded . 
  i especially like the fact that he 's not a karma whore and often submits a little less mainstream , but very interesting and informative content . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-23/yahoo-dell-swell-netherlands-13-trillion-tax-haven.html  tax avoidance has fostered a sizable industry in the netherlands of so-called trust firms , generating about ** 1 billion euros in annual tax revenues ** and about 3,500 jobs , according to a 2009 study by seo economic research . 
  local companies such as intertrust group holding sa and tmf group set up high-priced mailboxes for multinational companies , often by providing them with an address at their gleaming , high-rise office buildings near the amstel river and amsterdam 's massive soccer arena . 
  trust firms also provide non tax-related services , such as bookkeeping and payroll administration . 
  this is more than the cuts for the elderly in portugal and greece . 
  it is ** a lot ** . 
  i 'm with krattr on this one . 
  it will be more expensive to get in again in the future . 
  granted , they will make their balance sheets look prettier for a couple of years , but that 's shortsighted . 
  you 're 5 years in recession , it wo n't last forever . 
  how did i miss this ? 
  thank you !, 
  farage really had to have his flag up there ?
