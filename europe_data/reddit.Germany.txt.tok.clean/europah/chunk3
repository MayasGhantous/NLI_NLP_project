  people tend to upvote things they agree with . 
  i wo n't get to a debate about reddiquette , that 's how we 've seen it work here . 
  those downvoting you did not agree with you . 
  they do n't have a reason to downvote you before reading your argument . 
  they see a case they think it 's weak , they downvote . 
  it is n't difficult to understand . 
   just support those companies that do not charge roaming fees yes , let 's support those companies that do n't exist . 
  i 'll be that guy . 
  we had $ 8 . 
  now we have $ 7 . 
  can we find smarter methods to function with $ 7 ? 
  they would upvote you in any other case . 
  indeed , the people in charge of social media accounts of eu institutions can be very stupid . 
  works like a charm in germany . 
  since you never seem to get bored , i have one question for you . 
  can you read this ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pella_curse_tablet i suspect the answer is no . 
  they beat you in portugal . 
  with a german coach . 
  we remember !, 
  :-) not to mention that we 'll avoid plenty of brits if we choose the lesser known islands . 
  we 'll probably uncover a dinosaur meat scandal in 2053 . 
  ditto , i support your police force in this case . 
  seems like some people want to play political games , they could n't care less about those arrested . 
   can i get some feedback on why i am being downvoted ? 
  because you make a weak case ? 
  it is supported by facts that other people bothered enough to put together and offer in a clear manner for the public . 
  people will not read reports consisting of hundreds of pages , and are not qualified to process all the information . 
  scientists and experts do that . 
  the council of europe accepts the facts . 
  you can argue until the end of time , but it does n't matter . 
  it 's not an academic paper . 
  it 's supposed to inform the public about the findings of international organizations . 
  they use experts to communicate with readers .

  it seems you did n't read my other comment . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/184k4p/1_in_5_women_is_the_victim_of_domestic_violence/c8bkrs2  http://www.coe.int/t/dg2/equality/domesticviolencecampaign/fact_sheet_en.asp  an overview of figures for prevalence of violence against women suggests that one-fifth to one-quarter of all women have experienced physical violence at least once during their adult lives , and more than one-tenth have suffered sexual violence involving the use of force . 
  secondary data analysis supports an estimate that about 12 % to 15 % of all women have been in a relationship of domestic abuse after the age of 16 . 
  many more continue to suffer physical and sexual violence from former partners even after the break-up . 
  ngos just cite coe 's research . 
  more cold , hard facts . 
  domestic violence is common . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_344_en.pdf  domestic violence against women  report  fieldwork : february -- march 2010  publication : september 2010  domestic violence remains very common : one respondent in four across the eu knows a woman among friends or in the family circle who is a victim of domestic violence . 
  since the previous survey , the proportion of europeans ( on a comparable eu15 basis ) that say they know a victim of domestic violence in their circle of friends or family has increased from 19 % to 25 % . 
   one person in five knows of someone who commits domestic violence in their circle of friends and family ( 21 % ) . 
  from the council of europe , i suspect . 
  http://www.neurope.eu/article/council-europe-demands-action-domestic-violence  the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , nils mui\u017enieks has demanded action on domestic violence . 
   one fifth of women in europe have experienced physical violence , 10 % sexual violence and 45 % have been victims of stalking says nils mui\u017enieks . 
   more alarmingly , a study for the eu has revealed that there are around 3,500 deaths related to related to intimate partner violence each yea . 
  ** edit ** the original source .

  so the 1 in 5 claim is perfectly supported by facts coming from a very reliable source . 
  that was an informative read . 
  too bad that long reads are not appreciated here . 
  sad , but i 'm not surprised . 
  manuel also maintained that his pet was a siberian hamster . 
  namely . 
  echoing g_morgan 's comment , i 'm fairly sure there will be a transitional period for many matters . 
  interesting project . 
  there 's too much processing involved in `` printing '' food . 
  still a long way to go . 
  i said that it 's absurd to regulate everything . 
  i did not say that we should n't regulate anything . 
  there is a big difference . 
  not to mention that the child abuse analogy has been abused as a swiss-knife type of argument , for anything and everything . 
  what about [ polish plumbers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_plumber ) ? 
  how is it a liberal process , if you have a list of approved names ? 
  you just have more approved names since 2004 . 
  [ these are the provisions on first names . 
  ] ( http://www.familiestyrelsen.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/engelsksprogede_filer/the_danish_act_on_names.pdf )  first names  12 . -- ( 1 ) all individuals must , as a minimum , have one first name . 
   ( 2 ) the person or persons with parental responsibility for a child must , no later than six months after the birth of the child , choose a first name to which the child is entitled pursuant to sections 13 and 14 . 
   13 . -- ( 1 ) any name included on the list mentioned in section 14 ( 1 ) and approved pursuant to section 14 ( 3 ) may be adopted as a first name . 
   ( 2 ) a first name may not denote the opposite gender in relation to the individual who will bear the name . 
  the minister for family and consumer affairs may specify rules that exempt transsexual individuals from the provision in the first sentence . 
   14 . -- ( 1 ) the minister for family and consumer affairs publishes a list of names for boys and girls which may be adopted without approval pursuant to subsection ( 3 ) . 
   ( 2 ) the list mentioned in subsection ( 1 ) includes names which are or have been common in denmark , and names approved pursuant to subsection ( 3 ) . 
   ( 3 ) names that will be approved upon application are names that :  ( i ) are proper first names ,  ( ii ) are not unsuitable for use as a first name in denmark , and  ( iii ) are not inappropriate and that will not cause offence . 
   ( 4 ) the minister for family and consumer affairs may specify more precise rules pertaining to the publication and content of the list mentioned in subsection ( 1 ) , and the provisions mentioned in subsections ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . 
  a first name may be dropped provided the applicant retains or adopts another first name . 
  but you 're not the only ones , we have our own share of stupidity . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_name#forenames  in germany , the chosen name must be approved by the local standesamt ( office of vital statistics ) . 
  the name must indicate the gender of the child and not negatively affect the well being of the child . 
  last names or the names of objects and products are not acceptable . 
  for example , `` matti '' was rejected for a boy 's name because it did not indicate gender . 
  but nothing indicates gender . 
  it is our perception that gives meaning and indicates gender . 
  names did not drop from the sky . 
  what about using common sense ? 
  it is absurd to regulate everything , all the time , because someone might do something stupid . 
  we do n't limit the amount of coffee we are legally able to drink , because a nitwit might drink 50l in an hour . 
  your taxes pay for them . 
  this is hilarious !, 
  heh , the british invasion . 
  or all ? 
  the answer is a resounding yes . 
  [ i still think that lablanquetteestbonne 's charts are better ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/17da2k/chart_of_the_eu_spending_divided_by_gdp_by_country/ ) . 
  it 's about percentages and gdp , not absolute amount of money per person . 
  different countries have different capabilities and different living conditions .
