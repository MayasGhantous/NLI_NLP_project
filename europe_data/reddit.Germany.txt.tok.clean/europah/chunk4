  [ spiegel is their source . 
  of course , i do n't deny that . 
  he is trolling , as always . 
  thank you for this . 
  this shows that many large countries spent a small amount , but they get so much in return . 
  many people in other countries want the same . 
  i see no problems in sharing the same vision . 
   quickly ditching the economic argument then . 
  make me laugh . 
  i 'm the one pointing out that germany , an eu member , bound by eu 's rules and regulatons , is able to trade with the rest of the world without any problems . 
  you are your own problem . 
  the only positive news from you came a couple of days ago , with the identification of 8 great technologies to invest in . 
  you still have to produce something after that , but that 's a start . 
   the people do n't want . 
  it 's one thing to say that you reject something because it has measurable negative consequences , and another to say `` i just do n't like it '' . 
  facts and ideologies do n't mix . 
   this is a reply to the question you did not ask to which i replied it would n't be polite if i did n't reply to someone that dedicated his time to reply to me , even if his answer was for the wrong question . 
   everything you have just written , about what i wrote , must be reviewed in light of that revelation about what i had already written , but you had not read . 
  it would be inappropriate to reply to something i have n't read . 
   it * all * applied . 
  i 'm afraid not . 
  as an example , i do n't see how unfounded fear of a federation you would be part of , and ignorance about the different courts in our continent are arguments based on facts . 
   we understand procrastination mixed with horseshit when we see it then why cameron is your prime minister and you ca n't get your act together ? 
  why you are unable to produce ? 
  we are in the eu too . 
  the euro project was in design for ** much more ** than 7 years . 
  what you mention is only part of it . 
  this is a reply to a question i have not asked , and does not take into account the proposed reforms underway , as other redditors have pointed out . 
  in other words , you do n't reply to the question `` we 'll be that much better when we 're out '' but you complain about some unreformed current policies . 
  ** agriculture and fishing **  when half the eu budget goes towards cap half of an amount means nothing . 
  half of $ 2bn is $ 1bn , half of $ 100bn is $ 50bn . 
  $ 1bn for malta is a lot of money , $ 50bn for the eu is not . 
  the eu budget is small . 
  this makes cap 's percentage seemingly large . 
  it went up to 70 % in the past and it will go down to 40 % this year . 
  uk 's often cited common market described the goals of a cap from the very beginning . 
  cap was and is there for a reason . 
  you took it as part of the deal and voted for it . 
  cap was reformed again and again , and will be reformed again . 
  quotas are already set to expire , many proposals are on the table . 
  the agricultural ecosystem is dynamic and this should be reflected on how and where the eu spents our money . 
  * the reform process has started : http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ciolos/headlines/news/2013/01/20130124_en.htm  the cap does n't represent uk farms for the better , but allows continental farms to close the gap . 
  you do n't like others to have advantages in some sectors when you do n't benefit equally from it , in this case because you have a more urbanised population , but you do n't have any problems with sectors where you take a special interest in . 
  by the way your population still has to eat and you ca n't do it on your own . 
  eu is n't about maintaining imbalances , but about creating a level playing field , which means closing the gaps everywhere . 
  gaps lead to conflicts . 
  that 's why the eu was created for , we 've learned it the hard way . 
  you seem to think that what is n't in your interest is not of your concern . 
  this has to do with a certain kind of mentality , not with the eu . 
  while i agree that abuse of the subsidies system should stop , scrapping the system altogether and returning to a national subsidy system will provide fertile ground for more distortions and more scandals . 
  ** fishing ** i wo n't repeat the same points , but i will add that fish are a * mobile * natural resource . 
  they 're * common * property . 
  in or out , one party ca n't have its own way . 
  * the reform process has started and is a priority for the irish presidency : http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/mare/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=9310&amp;subweb=343&amp;lang=en ** trade **  the uk economy is unique to europe . 
  no , it 's just an economy of another eu member . 
  we do n't do exceptionalism here . 
  unless if by `` unique '' you mean being the clearing house for criminals manipulating rates , affecting the global economy . 
   are we expected to believe an eu commissioner best represents uk financial services when the uk , along with the czech republic , were the only two states which refused the eu fiscal compact ? 
  are labour supporters expected to believe that a conservative-led government best represents uk 's interests abroad and at home ? 
  are conservative supporters expected to believe that leaving the epp was good for your country 's interests in europe ? 
  we can do this for as long as you want . 
  you 're not the only country with an interest in financial services . 
  do you believe that 25 out of 27 states are stupid and do n't know what is best for them ? 
  well , you might believe this , but it would be very short-sighted of you . 
   we also should n't need the eu to trade with countries whom we share a head of state with !, 
  i could n't help but wonder : are black and jewish people expected to believe that you have an equal society when they are unable to reach to the post of the head of your state ? 
  ** political future **  they never wanted political unity or judicial courts . 
  my god , again with the issue of courts . 
  look , you are bound by international treaties , agreements , and all that jazz . 
  international courts already decide for you . 
  you ca n't escape that . 
  you could try , but you 'd have to leave the planet . 
  eu courts are for matters of eu law . 
  eu law is not a matter for intepretation from germany , the uk , or any other country . 
  it 's a matter for an eu institution . 
  common market or common market plus whatever you do n't like , you would still be bound by some rules , and someone would have to decide in the case of a dispute . 
  that 's the european court of justice . 
  as for the european court of human rights , it has nothing to do with the european union . 
  let me write it again . 
  the european court of human rights has nothing to do with the european union . 
  the council of europe is not the european union . 
  you are a founding member of the council of europe . 
  everyone in europe is a member , apart from belarus . 
  do you want to take belarus ' place ? 
  as for the political unity , you seem to forget how nations and nation-states were and are created . 
  we 're not far from the days of an undemocratic multinational empire in which you were part of . 
  i do n't see how the prospect of a democratic union could scare someone . 
  ** the uk response **  the uk is actually saying it will continue to be a net contributor , will continue contributing in european projects and defence . 
  it is saying it will get out of the way of federalism and deeper political integration for those members that need it . 
  the uk 's * current administration * is actually saying that it wants to create a mess by undoing what has been done , for short-term political gain . 
   eea contributions are considerably less than those of the eu , and the uk would only have to agree to regulations relating to the common market . 
  using the icelandic ratio that means approximately only ~ 7 % of them - whilst retaining all the benefits for the uk , control of the agriculture and fishing , and flexibility in trade outside the eu whilst still being a member of the common market . 
  germany trades outside of the eu while being a member of the eu . 
  germany is bound by eu regulations . 
  germany produces things that people outside of the eu want to buy . 
  my friends , ** you are your own problem ** , the eu is not to blame . 
  we were our own problem too , many times in the past . 
  we reformed and got our act together . 
  take a hint . 
  this .
