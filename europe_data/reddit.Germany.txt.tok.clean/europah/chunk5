  a greek once explained to me that german companies try to enter the balkan market starting with salonika , because the immigrants from the '50s and the '60s took their money back to greece to retire and they knew the brands they used in germany . 
  we reciprocate by using socks with sandals when going to halkidiki . 
  :p as for op , i would also vote berlin , although it 's more expensive and the weather is not that good . 
  it 's pretty bohemian though . 
  there are many atheists and christians in albania . 
  atheism was the state dogma during the communist years . 
   a lot of people there do n't regard electricity as a natural commodity , as something you pay for . 
  they take it for granted like the air they breathe ... do you have any data to back these claims , or you 're just reproducing some xenophobic excuses ? 
  come on , find a better title , many people do n't go past the first page and miss important things this way !, 
  a thousand upvotes for you . 
  forbrydelsen is another example . 
  the danish original was so , so good .

  what did i write ? 
   which ** was not ** even a mosque , and it ** is n't ** a mosque . 
  title of the article :  lego accused of racism amid claims jabba 's palace resembles istanbul 's hagia sophia mosque everything clear now ? 
  should i paste this again and again , until we all get our tenses right ? 
  while we 're at it , it 's moronic to accuse someone of racism , when you deny another religion the right to continue using its churches . 
  tell me about it . 
  bbc recently cut a fawlty towers scene from a hilarious episode that aired in 1975 . http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/poll/2013/jan/23/fawlty-towers-racist-language-cut  the corporation took the decision to cut a line from the show , in which major gowen , cantankerous permanent resident at fawlty towers , talks about the time he took a woman to see india play cricket : `` the strange thing was , throughout the morning she kept referring to the indians as niggers . 
  ` no , no , no , ' i said . 
  ` the niggers are the west indians . 
  these people are wogs . ' '', 
  it was supposed to make fun of racism and stereotypes , but the pc police has no sense of humour . 
  who defines the pressing concern ? 
  how do you know ? 
  did you ask the people ? 
  when was the last time you asked the people about it ? 
  do n't you want people to voice their opinion about it ? 
  it 's the only democratic thing to do , right ? 
  is n't the eu referendum about democracy ? 
  surely , democracy is n't a cherry-picking sport . 
   which was not even a mosque , and it is n't a mosque . 
  jpgs do n't resize nicely , there 's a limit to what a software solution can do for low resolution original material . 
  in any case , the one i found is much bigger ( 12 mb ) and will do the job . 
  i did . 
  i also searched tineye and google images , but without any luck . 
  i was looking for something that would print nicely in bigger sizes . 
  ** edit ** i found it . 
  they have a free high resolution pdf in the eu bookshop . 
  let 's give them a voice about everything , then . 
  monarchy , eu , the whole package . 
  lovely . 
  any chance for a bigger size ? 
  `` lego accused of racism amid claims jabba 's palace resembles istanbul 's hagia sophia mosque '' which was not even a mosque , and it is n't a mosque . 
   did you just say , `` larger that what you paid for greece '' yes . 
  the loan to ireland was * optional * . 
  your contribution to the imf was * not * . 
  you are member of this organization . 
   the point was that the uk paid additionally towards the ez , even if through the imf . 
  \u039d\u03bf , you did not paid * additionally * towards the eurozone and it 's not a semantics issue . 
  you are shareholder of this bank . 
  95 % of its shareholders approved a * loan * for some people . 
  a * loan * , as in `` i give some people money and they give me back more '' , which is happening * now * . 
  you ca n't go cherry-picking and say you will voluntarily provide an additional large loan for ireland , outside of this bank 's mechanisms , but you wo n't for greece , portugal , or any other country . 
  this is hypocritical , especially when taking into account that other nations , most of them poorer than you , approved the largest ever imf loan to * you * , when you needed it . 
  this cherry-picking attitude gets you ( the uk ) nowhere . 
  if i recall correctly , their gdp was 10 times smaller than what it is now . 
  it was big news at the time , from a historical perspective there 's not much difference between what happens now and what happened then . 
  i wrote :  ** you ** did n't pay anything special for greece or portugal . 
  ** you ** provided a bilateral loan to ireland . 
  i was referring to the uk . 
  you responded :  # 15bn in extra imf funding no , there is * nothing * extra in imf funding for ** you ** . 
  everything was part of the * regular * imf procedure , which you were * obliged * to follow ( ** more on imf membership later ** ) . 
  first of all , you 've got your [ exchange rates mixed up ] ( http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/gbp-eur-exchange-rate-history.html ) . 
  the amount is higher , more like # 23bn . 
  that 's how high my `` anti-uk sentiment '' is , correcting you with a higher amount . 
  second , the [ # 3.2 bn bilateral loan to ireland ] ( http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/int_loan_to_ireland.htm ) is larger that what you paid for greece through imf . 
  imf approved two loans for greece , $ 58bn ( # 48bn ) in total . 
  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/new050910a.htm http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2012/car031512b.htm see where the uk stands : http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx#u  quota  millions of sdrs 10,738.5  percent of total 4.51  votes  number 108,122  percent of total 4.29 as you see , the uk paid * far less * for greece through imf ( obligatory ) , than the amount paid for ireland bilaterally ( non-obligatory ) . 
  now add the $ 22.5 bn imf loan to ireland . 
  even after taking into account the $ 26bn imf loan to portugal , the total amount you paid for greece and portugal , two countries with a combined population 5 times larger than ireland 's , is lower . 
  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/car121610a.htm http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2011/pr11190.htm we 're not anti-uk , anglophobes or whatever the hell you want to name us . 
  personally , i like the uk . 
  also , this has nothing to do with our ancestors doing some fucked up things that put a large part of your population in suffering . 
  i was not alive and i ca n't turn back time . 
  and now we come to our conclusion . 
  why is the uk an imf member ? 
  because the uk needed imf and might need it again . 
  http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/sterling-devalued-imf-loan.htm  as pressure on the pound continued , the government approached the imf for a loan of $ 3.9 billion in september 1976 . 
  this was ** the largest amount ever requested of the fund , which needed to seek additional funds from the us and germany . 
  ** poor countries helped you through imf . 
  countries do stupid things and their friends help . 
  we did it , you did the same , let 's not forget it . 
  good night and good luck .

  i have no control over how some people are voting ; i only have control in what i write , and i put it here for us to discuss and criticize . 
  i do n't see myself or anyone else as pure black or pure white , we are all imperfect . 
  finally , i 'm not against some people because of their ethnic origin , and i do n't see myself as a saviour . 
  the problem is that their view is not the established mainstream view of this religion , thus making them akin to a cult . 
  this is a failed attempt to make it seem like the korean fan death incidents . 
   immediately dry your hair after a shower . 
  never go outside or go to sleep with wet hair . 
  makes sense to do these during colder months . 
  sleeping with wet hair is stupid . 
   never expose the back of you or your child 's neck to the wind during the fall , winter or spring . 
  makes even more sense to do these , if you have small children . 
   the back of your neck should always be covered with a hood or scarf . 
  during winter , why not ?
