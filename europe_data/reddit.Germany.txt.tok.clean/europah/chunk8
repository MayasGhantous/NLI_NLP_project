  the markets work in mysterious ways and a uk economic disaster might undermine investor confidence in the neighbourhood . 
  the neighbourhood is the eu and the eu includes germany . 
  we do n't need this in times of crisis . 
  we can take the hit in the long run , but it 's not necessary to prolong austerity because the uk wants to do something stupid . 
  my god , imagine what would happen if we had superpacs and all these attack ads . 
  i like it , but i want faces for the next series . 
  europe oozes culture and history , it 's not only about buildings . 
  i believe this discussion will start after our elections this autumn . 
  it is possible that greece will achieve a small primary surplus by the end of this year . 
  this means that the state can cover its costs . 
  this is a huge accomplishment in such a short time , for a state that could n't devalue . 
  they got so much negative publicity , which was often just slander , but it seems they made it . 
  that was very , very , very painful to watch . 
  this is a valid question , but it wo n't fly well over here because now we 're taking some things for granted . 
  people forget how their countries came to be . 
  look at germany and france 2-3 centuries ago . 
  suddenly , the situation in balkans seems familiar . 
  blame the eu . 
  did you ever try to run even a small business ? 
  this is impossible , we ca n't have it all . 
  people want less working hours , improved productivity , cheaper prices , more domestic production , more profits , and less taxes . 
  i want to be santa but i ca n't . 
  in this thread i 've learned that the north/south divide is artificial , and that people can not distinguish between acts of kindness and acts of fraud . 
  people have homes , too , and states is in plural . 
  nobody is expected to do anything . 
  you go out of your way to help me and i send you some flowers to acknowledge that . 
  also , even if all the citizens of the biggest eu country started giving one bottle of wine each to their doctors for a period of 10 years , the total amount would be laughable compared to the amount that was overpaid due to libor fraud over the course of a day . 
  we 're not robots , we 're people and we do nice things for each other . 
  at least some of us , as it is evident from this thread . 
  you have a dated receipt , and the value of the gift is negligible compared to the services offered . 
  that 's the meaning of a * symbolic * gift . 
  it 's something small , wine , flowers , a book , things like that . 
  value , position , and timing play a big role . 
  it 's one thing to bribe a surgeon operating in a public hospital in order to get operated early , and another to sent flowers to a doctor in a private practice if he got out of his way to help you outside of office hours . 
  jesus , people . 
  we 're not talking about the libor scandal here , have a sense of scale . 
  politicians develop relationships over time , it 's not unusual to receive personal gifts . 
  we 're not talking about a luxury car here , but about folk art products , drinks , etc. 
  afaik , there is a limit in monetary value and this is observed in most advanced states . 
  perhaps you have a limit in monetary value . 
  even ministers can accept gifts from foreign politicians , it is not considered an attempt to influence foreign policy . 
  you were treated . 
  i wrote this . 
   ** after ** he has done his job and ** you paid him already ** it 's an appreciation gift , not a bribe . 
   if you want your kids to have an education useable in the marketplace exactly . 
  i use multiple oses ( windows , linux , android , ios ) and i always install open source or freeware solutions for personal use , but the marketplace is what it is . 
  people need skills that are usable now . 
  if the marketplace changes , then education will change . 
  it 's not illegal to give a bottle of wine to anyone , after he has done his job and you paid him already . 
  as rmc says below , sometimes . 
  while i might see something as obvious , you need absolute proof and preparation to bring a country to court . 
  i 'm sure that hungarians will find pretty words to mask what they want . 
  they wo n't say that you have to have hungarian blood for 20 generations . 
  if they proceed , it will take time to undo what they did . 
  none of the above . 
  the point is that the many countries believe that they are right on a number of issues , and look after their interests . 
  this includes the uk . 
  india called . 
  remember that most redditors are very young and do n't know much about the past . 
  i do n't understand how the uk thinks it has the right to dictate what other countries should do , on a number of issues . 
  go to your stupid sexy flanders and leave us weeping !, 
  you have a point here . 
  if we are going to let biology rule insurance schemes , then we should not be able to pick and choose . 
  me too . 
  luggage space is not expanding . 
  bavarians = germans do n't shoot me , it 's a joke !, 
  it is definitely blown out of proportion . 
  to be fair , greece takes all the load from middle east and asia , as the closest schengen country . 
  it would be more productive to change the eu regulation and help these poor immigrants collectively . 
  good luck in carrying that with you , in our spaceship !, 
  balance of power , conflict ... 
  it 's not only about hunting . 
   with any luck we 'll survive op 's death trap , faust can be heavy . 
  i see what you did there :p, 
  i see that some countries picked up really fast . 
  50 % in 6 years is no joke . 
  you 're pissing some of your people off , with your facts and all these exotic number stuff . 
  that would be the french . 
  for some reason , i read that as middle earth . 
  spanish speaking german . 
  well , i ca n't say that i 'm proud about that development . 
  i mean , this could end in tears . 
  no supervision , no stress tests = no reliability , no transparency . 
  too soon . 
  my thoughts exactly , but i suspect there are problems with local councils , environmentalists , hunters , birdwatchers , architects , and so on . 
  it 's the same everywhere , you ca n't find many spots easily . 
  tectonic shifts , you know . 
  that was really good . 
  do n't give up guys !, 
  there are too many coincidences to attribute everything to luck . 
  they could n't fool the byzantine populations that were already in contact with nations next to their empire . 
  today we define many groups as roma , for simplicity , but they arrived from the east following different routes . 
  i just think that the request is not as innocent as it might seem . 
  i would advise against a career in fortune telling . 
  do i really need to point out the errors and the fallacies in your reasoning ? 
  i think not . 
  the fine is about $ 23k . 
  your other comment contains the most important part . 
   the second document is really the issue here . 
   `` the second document included , in essence , the background to the ` titlos ' 2 transaction as well as an analysis carried out by ecb staff on the financial structure of that transaction and the possible existence of ** similar transactions effected by other member states ** [ ... ] it was not about greece , it was an attempt to get the eu to commit suicide , with speculators happily watching .
