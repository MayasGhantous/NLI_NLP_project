sounds like the british are pretty blinded or do n't know how the eu works, 
  he 's not kidding , he 's just edgy, 
   western governments fund their hospitals to take medical personnel from eastern europe and condemn eastern europeans to live as 2nd class citizens in dirty , under-equipped and under-staffed hospitals . 
  this sub has become a joke, 
  its germany 's fault romanians earn shit in their country, 
  the 19th century called . 
  guess you remembered something from history class at least, 
  they 'll bring it up once one side is painfully non-controversial , like every other topic they choose, 
   point out where it is said that europeans have to accept migrants ( not refugees ) from outside of the eu and i 'll agree with you . 
  nice job editing your comment though point out where it is said that having to accept migrants from outside of the eu is a violation of human rights and i 'll agree with you  we have a right to live our lives like we used to not a human right either . 
  perfectly valid to argue about this but please stop bringing human rights into it, 
  i think you have no idea what human rights are, 
  at least youre revealing your true colors here it 's still funny how you go from implying a second german holocaust to blaming it for wanting other countries to help refugees . 
  not to mention germany does n't fine anyone , the eu does . 
  those border checks from austria are not controversial at all in the affected areas and if you have n't realised , they 're there to stop illegal immigrants and smugglers , not refugees . 
  this was the plan all along in every eu country , it just may take some more measures than it used to, 
  you think that day will be in the near future with all the drama about supporting isis and whatnot ? 
  why do n't you read some more national news then instead of / r/europe where your country happens to be irrelevant, 
  is n't it just more expensive to run a business in many european countries because of economic reasons like minimum wage , insurance paid by the employer or similar ? 
  a sentence requires a written verb or an implied one so its not a sentence . 
  guess you can call it a term, 
   where as in europe look mate , you can get out of the eu if you want but you 'll still be in europa : ^ \\ ^ ), 
   imminent threat of russian invasion would n't go that far, 
  [ `` how do the germans view americans '' ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/eb54c1479a1d10294935ca59deea8530.jpg ), 
   perhaps a moderate behavior that 's what 's gon na happen when it 's time, 
   opposite of being bored feels like a feeling, 
  if an ethnic german joining them results in loads of articles about him , i would n't be too worried about it being common, 
  he 's not refering to anything , he just used european austerity as his reason leading to suggest he didnt read the link . 
  and you 're basically just repeating what the guy above you said . 
  did the `` refugees welcome '' message from the german public ever get any traction other than a couple days ago ? 
  if not i do n't even see how this is a valid argument . 
  all merkel always talked about officially was solidarity and other buzzwords but other european leaders did the same, 
  it 's not nearly as bad as any other subreddit covering news . 
  try to find an article about refugees in europe with a positive title in / r/worldnews for example . 
  they 'll never see the light of the frontpage, 
  you 'd be surprised what sort of plans every single army has , just in case, 
  there 's nothing wrong with this reasoning but we 're a mid-size subreddit , not mainstream media . 
  the discussion already takes place on frontpage reddit and much bigger venues like r/worldnews . 
  if there were zero related threads here , how many / r/europe visitors do you think would not get exposed to it through tv , radio , newspaper , other subreddits etc. . . ? 
  banning it here does n't achieve anywhere close to enough to support this strategy to excuse the removal of discussion here, 
  so threads in one language are a weird , specific , bad setup glad you know how to use xkcds to support your position, 
  fuck bitch navy seals al - quaeda 300 gorilla wipe out shit fucker, 
  creating megathreads to combat spam and duplicates is one thing . 
  removing the initial thread and discussion in this process is another . 
  not even giving an english article in the megathread ? 
  makes perfect sense, 
  not just functionally , but pretty much officially . 
  99 + % of mentions of removal in any rules on reddit refer to what he names `` delisting '' . 
  controversial threads are crosslinked all over reddit and social media and while i have often followed links to `` delisted '' aka removed threads , i have never encountered a 404-type page , one that would have to be the result of literal thread deletions . 
  but maybe mods and admins are just gods at never using actual removal of threads and comments that have had its direct link posted anywhere else, 
   in any case , i often ca n't believe the lack of tact exhibited by high ranking diplomats . 
  it 's like they have no filter or something . 
  i mean ... just because something is true/obvious does n't mean you should say it out loud whenever you think of it . 
  most of the article does revolve around that and the bottom line defense seems to be that things were said in off-the-record conversations in hebrew and selected statements were taken out of their broader context and distorted in a way that alters their meaning . 
  how ignorant was/am i for never really mentally connecting the dots from the holocaust to today 's israel ? 
  i 'm concerned cause i thought israel was in fact `` just another country '' up until now  she even said that without them , we 'd be just another country as far as they 're concerned . '', 
  his emphasis leads me to believe that is indeed the joek, 
  what else are you supposed to watch though ? 
  nothing i guess ? 
  analogy = rekt, 
  dude i wish our chancellor would look like that, 
  what 's wrong with russians ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's directly about society aswell . 
  just look at the story characters from gta v , especially michaels entire family . 
  they all fit a typically american stereotype that 's taken to the extreme to ridicule it . 
  then most other npcs have a lot of funny quotes they just randomly say, 
  you do n't really believe that do you, 
  the laws are strict but certain parties are above the law it seems, 
  he meant to write dat ** a ** isbeautiful but ended up writing dat ** e ** isbeautiful, 
  jesus , everything is so hostile, 
   scuffles between the police and pegida supporters started after the demonstrators hurled firecrackers and beer bottles at law enforcers . 
  not sure if we 're living in the same country . 
  i 'm talking about the one that protests over things such as turkey killing a bunch of kurds, 
  . . inaction ? 
  that 's the first time i 've heard that one it takes the tiniest thing to get thousands to the streets and protest to force a reaction from the government , i do n't think i 've observed that on the same level in any other country false promises go hand in hand with democracy and holding politicians accountable is a fairy tale in literally every western democratic model . 
  i 'm not sure how these examples serve your initial point anyways, 
  fascinating ... a 3 sentence long article about hungary not putting pressure on poland like most of the eu over their new government going a little authoritarian turns into merkel forcing quotas on poland, 
  you should read the article . 
  it 's 3 sentences long, 
   he said bulgaria , one of greece 's northern neighbours , should be adopted into the eu 's border-free schengen zone just toss that one in there huh, 
  i agree , politics are never funny but are you really trying here or just being le funny troll ? 
  also it 's flattering of you to equate germany to the eu like that, 
  if that 's a joke about recent/current events in poland , i 'm missing it, 
  does the original have that same smug sarcastic tone or did you add that in the translation ? 
  hats off if its the former , bold move, 
  i do think having a land border as opposed to no border and an ocean inbetween helps a lot to carry out deportations though and earlier you said  at the least illegal immigrants in the us know if they draw too much attention to themselves they will be deported . 
  the eu ca n't even manage that . 
  yet the article specifically mentions rejected asylum seekers flee to other parts of the country and do the exact opposite of drawing attention they 've lost their chance to get welfare or a job ; i would n't be surprised if many of them resurface eventually, 
  did you read some articles on it ? 
  i 'm interested but not sure what to google for, 
   how long before the women of cologne are advised to stay indoors , or even cover their heads ? 
  so we just pretend this is good journalism if you do n't have an official agenda ? 
   there will be hundred of thousands of people today in the famously civilised city of cologne , who will be in a state of shock about a similar `` cultural misunderstanding '' . 
  sorry , what ? 
   up to 1,000 men a.k.a 100-200  if you are doctrinally commanded to cover up your women then the sight of a woman like the lovely , blonde michelle , who is both uncovered and happily self-confident , provokes temptation , and this makes you angry . 
  a little creepy to reference a victim of sexual assault like this but amazing how she has figured out the mind of the rapey muslim immigrant just like that . 
  i bet their blood was boiling while they did those things  i was truly astounded , however , when a libyan spokesman appeared on our local tv news . 
  the uniformed male said he was sorry , but the libyans did n't realise that you were n't allowed to do such things in england . 
  it was an unfortunate case of cultural misunderstanding . 
  i am also astounded , why not say a little more about that incident or provide a source ?
