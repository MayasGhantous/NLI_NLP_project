everything has to go through both parliaments . 
  it is more complicated than that . 
  some federal matters are not subject to bundesrat-control . 
   so in the worst case , a land slide can change 50 % of the system and the newly elect rulers will still have to compromise with the other 50 % on everything . 
  or you can have a perfectly viable federal government that suddenly turns into a sitting duck as the majority in the bundesrat changed due to state elections . 
   bernie sanders gave up his candidate status for social democratic concessions that now will never happen . 
   simply being anti-establishmen i do n't get how people can look at a born rich billionaire who never really had to pay real taxes and see anti-establishment . 
  just because he 's not part of the certain clique within the establishment ? 
  might have been the one good idea the us had lately . 
   that 's the first step in defeating her . 
  the problem is the difficulty of fighting populism . 
  those who do n't care for facts because the bullshit their leader is telling them feels right are mostly lost to any argument . 
  it usually only ends when they get smacked in the face by reality * hard * . 
   is now serving a time penalty oh the hard hard life of being a junior partner in the grand coalition . 
  i do n't know . 
  [ rudis tagesshow ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rudis_tagesshow ) predates both . 
  just because someone does a similar format does n't mean it 's a rip-off , especially if it 's as broad as `` funny news '' . 
   these people and their families spent generations nice ironic phrasing . 
  so there an underclass of poor that is stable over generations without any real chance of social mobility -- but it 's of course the fault of those bad foreigners . 
  since his area of historical expertise overlaps considerably to the same topics from a sociological point of view i 'm not sure that matters . 
  researching historians usually specialize on a narrow field of history . 
   he tries to play historian but is shit at it . 
  of course , you know better who is historian and who is not [ than princeton university ] ( https://history.princeton.edu/people/jan-tomasz-gross ), 
  that would be an [ earth quake swarm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/earthquake_swarm ) then , would n't it ? 
  italy does n't frack , does it ? 
   note that the girl in this hamburg gang rape case did n't appear in court . 
  and nevertheless the case went to trial and the adult rapist involved got 4 years of prison . 
  a50 requires a unilateral declaration and then a consensus decision about the exit terms . 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  we could ask e.g. 
  namibia if they take the crazies in exchange for some additional development funds . 
  the gender of german compound words is determined by the last word in german . 
  if there is no noun for that word in german , we often use the gender of the corresponding translation . 
  so for `` british exit '' , the last part is `` exit '' , which is translated to `` der ausgang '' , so `` der brexit '' . 
   all that hollande says is that a hard brexit is the only fair brexit . 
  not at all . 
  it is the only thing that makes sense and is possible given the uk 's insistence on controlling migration . 
  the norwegian model would be just as acceptable to the rest of europe , maybe with some reservations about the viability of the deal for the brexit minded public . 
  ( there is n't much won if a soft brexit is done and the same bullshit starts happening after a few years ) . 
  there ca n't be cherry picking . 
  wonder what the pound will still be worth by 2021 . 
  are we sure this is not banned as bio terrorism ? 
  they failed to establish a second ring of police catching potential runners . 
  revolution is ungerman . 
   the stress test is an outlook into the future . 
  it 's basically `` what would happen in a worst case scenario '' . 
  this was how it was sold . 
  this and other things show that it was more of a `` do n't worry , everything is fine '' measure to increase trust in the european banking system and calm the markets . 
  except that he apparently is an [ ukip supporter ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4r8q9h/nigel_farage_if/d4zdpxo?context=3 ) and [ ok with spreading anti foreigner sentiments ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/51mz5m/peter_hitchens_visits_probrexit_boston/d7dbogd?context=3 ) . 
  the eu gave the uk special favors and privileges up the wazoo . 
  this is the result of the uk establishment and media blaming the eu for their own faults and also just xenophobia and racism in the uk . 
   if we all collectively condemn the rise of abuse toward minorities and immigrants in a post-referendum uk , then we equally should condemn treating our british members with active disdain because of the majority vote of their countrymen . 
  oh please . . you ca n't compare violently attacking random people in the streets with getting verbally shit on as a result of your own hate campaign . 
  now you 're in the `` only geographically part of europe '' group , like russia or turkey . 
  optics and visual perception work the same in poland as they do elsewhere . 
  why do n't you go there , take a photo with a normal camera and have a look at it and compare it to this picture . 
  you 'll see . 
   but i do n't see why we should prioritize the people who hired human traffickers to enter our countries illegally . 
  for the unfortunate fact that they 're no longer in syria or whereever , but in our countries/stuck on the balkan route . 
  the german law is certainly not applicable in syria , but it very much has to applicable to * everyone * here and at our borders . 
  the european integration and solidarity extends that somewhat to the eu territory . 
  the thing is that the refugee crisis had been predicted a long time ago , but no one actually did anything even when people started drowning en masse . 
  of course it would have been and would be much more sensible to actually help the people in their home countries and not just help the strongest because they can make it de facto our problem . 
  [ here 's some explanation of it ] ( http://lifehacker.com/5991508/what-is-hdr-and-when-should-i-use-it-in-my-photos ) . 
  the style became very popular , very quickly with a lot of people and has been widely critized by photographers/artists for the kind of pictures it creates . 
  surreal , unnatural sharpness and detail all over the image , giving the eye neither directional hints nor rest . 
  this image is certainly not the worst , but it suffers a lot from that i think . 
  you can create good results if you 're careful and use the right tools . 
  [ this article has some good examples ] ( http://www.lightstalking.com/the-truth-about-hdr-photography-is-it-really-that-bad/ ) . 
  no , it 's just the discussion no one wants to have . 
  the german basic law is what it is exactly because of the genocides of the nazi era . 
  it establishes the individual human rights as prime directive . 
  you ca n't just wave away the consequences from that because it is inconvenient to actually try to deal with refugees instead of letting them rot in bad humanitarian conditions . 
  you also should n't let the mediteranean nations carry the whole load of the crisis , but that 's another point . 
  i 'm sick of hearing how we could defuse the populists by doing the sick and twisted stuff they demand voluntarily . 
  fuck all of that . 
  it clearly looks like a hdr composite to me . 
  this is some hdr stuff . 
  this is more than just a few retouches . 
  it 's reinventing the scene . 
  meanwhile in photoshop ... 
  in short , if all parties agree that killing jews is bad , it 's their fault when populists start killing jews again . 
  it 's not about what 's right or wrong , it 's just about giving the people what they want . 
  kill jews ? 
  done . 
  done . 
  how will we know what 's inside you ? 
  science sometimes requires sacrifice , you know . . 
   ask this question a thousand random people . 
  science is not the same as family feud . 
   do n't brainwash little children into your cult . 
  tradition is of course totally no cult . 
  `` instead i will demand that they conform to * my * limited unterstanding and interpretation of the world . '', 
   unfortunately humans are pretty messy and they ca n't be studied in the large hadron collider mostly because it 's generally frowned upon to collide together humans at high velocities to study their inner workings . 
   if you as a regular person would write that poem to cite it on your no-nonsense youtube channel , the prosecutor could have made a different decision . 
  or if b\u00f6hmermann had made the same poem about a regular person on youtube . 
  erdogans elevated position of public interest means he has to suffer through more than the average private person . 
  his behavior in censoring the press and his reactions to the other song by extra3 also provided the necessary context for the satire ( you ca n't just have a go at someone for being a politician ) . 
  what !? 
  being right next to a huge country being a major market for drugs * and * providing guns surely does n't help .
