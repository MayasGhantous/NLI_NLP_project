   why the fuck even launching a smear campaign in the first place ? 
  because they 're fucking * crypo-nazis * ? 
  hey . . why should we get upset about people aiming at a repeat of the last time they murdered millions and caused even more millions to die . 
  edit : * in any official capacity or way that goes beyond writing a letter . 
   if you think a business should be ruined who did `` ruin '' the restaurant ? 
  some politicians wrote a not even strongly-worded letter . 
  a brewery exercised their economic rights as they saw fit . 
  the restaurant owner did not yield to that mild pressure and then faced the financial consequences of everything . 
   and even attacked i never advocated or excused any attacks , which by the way , do n't seem that substantial . 
  a few grafitti and stickers is what you can expect in a large city in any case . 
  i just fail to see a reason to get upset . 
  everyone but the vandalizers acted within the scope of their rights and the outcome follows the logic of our market economy . 
  this is just another occasion for / r/europe rightwing circle jerk . 
   then it 's you who 's the intolerant bigot here yeah , right . . no projection here . 
  if only there was a difference between your race and voluntarily joining a political hate group . 
  restaurant houses regular meetings of racists and bigots , politicians give their opinion , people stay away , turnover drops 25 % , brewery cancels lease , restaurant closes . 
  so what am i supposed to be upset about ? 
  that everyone did what they had the right to do and people voted with their feet ? 
  if we assume the french to be as stupid as the americans . . 
  [ ` the role of islamic inheritance in the development of islamic mathematics ' on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_inheritance_jurisprudence#the_role_of_islamic_inheritance_in_the_development_of_islamic_mathematics ), 
  macron is the french `` hope and change '' guy . 
  why should a person from algeria be judged by the fact that there are more criminals coming from his poor country ? 
  should n't we be looking at personal merits and not vague guesses based on ethnicity ? 
   spain and the uk are civilized countries that have not let a small rock get in the way of the bigger picture . 
  in contrast to to argentina and the uk who did ? 
  die mannschaft still wears white and black because those where the colors of prussia , the dominant state when they first played in 1908 . 
  they 're not really wearing flag colors . 
  in later years , the jerseys usually included the national colors somewhere in small . 
  not sure about the racing thing , not a big racing sports aficionado . 
  but is n't that the silver of mercedes ' `` silberpfeile '' / `` silver arrows '' ? 
  all in all it 's mostly the combination of it being a flag and red , white and black being present that feels not right . 
  we germans usually do n't feel that positively about displaying flags in the first place . 
  there are certainly exceptions for the black-red-gold during soccer events , especially since 2006 , but everything containing black-white-red is either flagged by neonazis , the rightwing fringe or clueless americans . 
  in general , red-white-black are the colors of totalitarian germany , i feel uncomfortable with that flag . 
   i hate it when i also accidentally misdial a world leader no , it was * erdogan * . 
  the percentages of people doing atrocious things is even lower than that 33.09 % result at the elections . 
  the wehrmacht was only in parts involved in war crimes ( round 10 to 20 % ) , even less people where directly involved with the concentration camps . 
   or profited from them what profit did the average german have to expect ? 
  the nazi policies very much did n't redistribute any wealth besides the stolen properties which all ended up in the hands of high nazi caders . 
  as is that ever stopped anyone , especially the poles , from demonizing us . 
  who cares if only 33.09 % voted for hitler , germans are clearly evil !, 
  yeah , right , that had absolutely nothing to do with france invading parts of germany before . 
  it 's really odd . 
  sometimes it sounds yiddish , then austrian and then suddenly like german with russian accent . 
   you 're asking people to predict the future without the possibility to correct their mistake if it turns out they were not , in fact , clairvoyant . . clairvoyancy is certainly not helped by drastically misrepresenting the current situation and outlook and/or making ridiculous promises on busses . 
  on my distribution ( ubuntu 16.04 ) there 's also capslock + \u00df and also altgr + shift + s to get the new \u1e9e, 
  other people were killed , but the term holocaust specifically relates to the killing of jews :  the holocaust , [ b ] also referred to as the shoah , [ c ] was a genocide in which some six million european jews were killed by adolf hitler 's nazi germany , and the world war ii collaborators with the nazis . 
  -- [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust ), 
   you ca n't fight an ideology with a non belief atheism is just one form of exercising religious freedom thus ca n't be the basic ideology in the first place . 
  that would be the principles of being a free and open democratic society , which is far from being a `` non-belief '' . 
   does n't mean we have to cede the primacy of our own beliefs to them who is `` we '' when large parts of german citizen are either atheist or only formally christian without any participation ? 
  a religious minority that controls everything ? 
  after the balkan wars were over , 95 % of the refugees in germany returned home . 
  not sure the 5 % are reason to get ones panties in a bunch and threaten cooperation and solidarity among the european states . 
  immigration and refugees are two different topics . 
  this is about refugees . 
  the state has to respect the * universal * human rights in all his actions . 
  that is the difference between just and unjust . 
  * everyone * enjoys human rights unconditionally . 
  i am generally against using weasel word tactics to specifically circumvent these rules . 
  who needs principles if you can employ lots of weasel wording ? 
   sick and borderline psychotic grudge against them [ ... ] really , really bitter towards brits it 's always hilarious reading such analysis having followed the brexit campaigning based on xenophobia , anti-eu lies and just plain lies . 
  and the rest of europe is supposed to respond with the kind of stiff upper lip the brits want to see themselves as having but nearly constantly failed to come even close to in this matter . 
  yeah . . you just end with with [ laws like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuremberg_laws ) and the corresponding atrocities . 
  no , the one that was abolished was [ \u00a7 103 defamation of * organs and representatives of foreign states * ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1035 ) , not the \u00a7 185/186 i linked to . 
  erdogan had sued under both laws and lost both . 
   `` i hate those muslim goatfuckers , they 're all terrorists '' if you say that in relation to a specific muslim , they can sue you for [ insult and/or defamation ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1694 ) though . 
   i hope it will causes as much outrage and changes in government legislation may : `` we need even more internet surveillance '', 
  * hope and change !, 
  `` yeah , you saw it !, 
  we fucked up both times ! '', 
   you enjoying content without the content creator getting paid = piracy or is it fair use ? 
  that is more about tax evasion than anything , is n't it ? 
   extra-ordinarily cuntish that was related to the nazi-era . 
   the treatment of the pagans this is an hilarious example by the way . 
  the big bad german charlesmagne is of course not totally the same guy as the glorious founder of france , charlesmagne , and the way christianity was spread in europe has of course nothing to do with your british culture here . 
  that 's all on us germans . 
  edit : when napoleon conquers us , he is the great conqueror . 
  when the pissed germans retribute in the franco-prussians wars , they 're of course the bad ones . 
  the 30 year war mostly never happened , i guess . 
   germany 's history is not one of unblemished moral perfection and humanity i described it as `` comparatively good '' and not `` extra-ordinary cuntish '' . 
  that does not seem to be quite the same . 
  the estimates about the percentage of wehrmacht soldiers taking part in atrocities was about 12 % if i remember correctly . 
  apart from that , it was also a matter of timing that makes it somewhat plausible . 
  due to joining early he managed to snatch a good post as driver for a higher up and missed most of the early war because he either came there late when everything was over , then he got stuck with the car in yugoslavia waiting for it to be repaired . 
  the first real battle experience he had was as reinforcement in stalingrad , where he froze several toes off so that the war was already over in 42 for him . 
  none of my relatives were the classic resistance heros . 
  first husband of my grandmother ended up in a concentration camp for being communist , my great-grandfather evaded capture by living in the bavarian woods for 5 years . 
  i did not start the comparison to germany , i did not start out with presenting any ashkenazim heritage , but i wo n't let `` hurr durr , your grandfather gassed jews '' stand just like that . 
  i did not blame the brits for the past , i was pointing out the consequences of that , mostly to the `` our culture is in danger '' crowd . 
   that germany 's history was worse on the grounds that it can not be reduced to a period of 12 years . 
  and the rest was comparatively good . 
   but do n't shit on one country for its past that might be your perception . 
  personally , i was taken a piss at your racists / the majority mentioned here . 
   no one should be held responsible for the sins of their fathers yeah , i that was directed at current actions . 
   trying to excuse german involvement as minor i 'm was not excusing , i was telling it like it was . 
  it was very very minor . 
  the german public was very much opposed to slavery ever since serfdom slowly ended . 
   failure to secure markets yes , of course . . 
  if all the land-locked german states just would have been sea empires , they would be at least as shitty .
