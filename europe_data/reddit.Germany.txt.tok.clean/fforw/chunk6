  better marginalize more !, 
  nuanced in this case means dealing with multiple historically placed views on things , some of which have survived until now . 
   his view is certainly held by enough people you do n't say that rich people come with the self-serving views that go with it . 
  what does this have to do with this imam and the accusations of supporting slavery ? 
  do we blame the pope and christianity for josef fritzl and marc dutroux ? 
  he referred to traditional interpretation of certain quran passages which are now superceded by the abolition of slavery and human rights etc. 
  as i said , wilfully ignorant . 
  if you want to continue this , i suggest to you keep reading this exchange over and over until your understanding improves , i 'm done with this . 
  his point from the beginning and my point here being that he did not say these things or only in the same sense that you said . 
   indeed , i 'm dumb . 
  you said those words , but i intenionally omitted the context . 
  of course i 'm just a poster fucking with a wilfully ignorant individual and not being payed to publish this drivel as `` news '' . 
  did you aim to ironically relate to his statement  tyranny is the deliberate removal of nuance or does this just come natural to you ? 
   indeed , [ ... ] i 'm dumb see ? 
  now you 're saying it yourself . 
  is n't this fun ? 
  you really made your case there . 
  * this * is called lacking reading comprehension skills and also lacking intellectual capacity for nuanced debate referencing historic contexts . 
  just drag them around the corner and shoot them in the head , savages !, 
  depends on how being `` against islam '' manifests . 
  if it involves advocating human rights violations for muslims , then , yes , i would compare that . 
  you know the `` put them in camps '' , `` send them back into the war zone '' , `` deport legal citizen for being muslim '' crowd . 
  tell us [ who gave you the money ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal ) or stfu . 
  i such hypotheticals are a crime , you can arrest half of / r/europe for thought crimes against muslims . 
   germany spends more than half that much yearly on refugees alone . 
  yes . 
  and the refugees just sit on the money . 
  it does n't get spent in germany for food and lodging . 
  this seems different from being scared of selfie sticks . 
  bingo . . well , not only discussed . . taken as representative example for that slice of society . 
  all muslims ... !, 
  i should have added the / s. 
  it 's just amazing how little you hear of these things when `` white '' brits are involved ( bbc case anyone ? ), 
  but how often the one in rotherham is brought up in a general discussion about muslims . 
  let 's focus on that muslim paedophile ring , shall we ? 
  because this one clearly does not represent the majority of people . 
  edit : / s, 
  it 's also being in the comfy position of being the largest recipient of eu funds , while blaming the eu for everything that 's wrong -- especially gay , bicycle-riding vegetarians that threaten good polish values . 
  i 'm not against poland prospering . 
  i am against regressive nationalism , in any nation , especially within the eu . 
   poland hurray stupid backwards nationalism !, 
  well . . this might have been a good opportunity to turn that shirt inside out . . 
  the fact that it is political theatre to present one source of danger and blame millions of peaceful people for it while downplaying an even greater threat . 
  right . . when facts are spun into narrative here , pointing out conflicting facts is a `` horrbile attempt at a rebuttal '' . 
  do n't derail the hate train , gotcha . 
  in the classic ( now neo - ) nazi sense . 
  newsflash : no group of people will ever be perfect . 
  you 're the one framing humatarian efforts and aid for refugees in exclusively muslim terrorism terms . 
  so you 're ok with being killed just as long as it is a wholesome patriotic inner country killing ? 
  nothing the right-wing loons [ have n't done ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oktoberfest_terror_attack ) . 
  strange how the right-wing loon exception has so far killed so much more people in germany , even if we start post ww2 . 
  i did not say it was impossible . 
  i said there is no evidence for that . 
  and there is lots of evidence against it . 
  there is no evidence for that either . 
  his parents emigrated is from a now overwhelmingly muslim country , but as i said : just after the iranian islamic revolution . 
  religious people do n't flee from religious revolutions . 
  a ) people emigrating from iran after the islamic revolution are generally not known to be highly religious . 
  b ) he was a right-wing lunatic who killed mostly muslim immigrants c ) there 's evidence he [ converted to christianity ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000041670966/was-wir-ueber-den-taeter-wissen-und-was-nicht ) d ) the `` you 're wanker , that 's what you are . '', 
  video has him going on about how he is german and bullied by those muslims etc. 
  e ) [ iranian is not the same as muslim ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianity_in_iran ) ( also not the same as arab ) . 
  edit : `` david '' also could be a name of christian background . 
  we were talking about merkel and germany . 
  and again : ** he was no muslim ** . 
  who considered himself aryan , was proud to share a birthday with the f\u00fchrer and admired anders breivik . 
  and you go and decide that him being of iranian descent ( i 'm not aware there is evidence he even was muslim at all ) is the thing that determines him . 
  you seem to be part of the problem . 
  edit : hah . 
  our secretary of the interior [ reported evidence for him having converted to christianity ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000041670966/was-wir-ueber-den-taeter-wissen-und-was-nicht ) and his parents reported him as not being religious . 
  the deadliest of the recent attacks was a right-wing loon . 
  have you ever been to germany ? 
  do you speak german ? 
  what makes you think you know so much better what 's going on here and what to do than us germans ? 
  haha . . 
  i think there 's a nice saying in english that seems to apply here  cutting off the nose to spite the face, 
  he specifically targeted muslim immigrants . 
  he was a right-wing loon . . admired anders breivik , planned his attack for the 5th anniversary of the ut\u00f8ya massacre . 
  edit : [ faz article about it ( german ) ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/f-a-z-exklusiv-amoklaeufer-von-muenchen-war-rechtsextremist-14359855.html ) edit2 : [ guardian ( english ) ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/27/munich-gunman-saw-sharing-hitlers-birthday-as-special-honour ), 
  i do n't . 
  but that 's what the law says at least . 
  instead we should surely vote for an economic suicide pact , right ? 
  it is controversial because a large part of why these dark nets exist is government overreach and blatant illegal practices and mass surveillance . 
  we do n't abandon privacy of correspondence because you can write bad letters . 
  we do n't ban all shady bars because you might buy illegal stuff there . 
  hmm . . could that be because we generally do n't call ordinary military terrorists ? 
  they kill a lot more people for sure . . 
  this is to check and balances as a lynch mob is to justice . 
  [ representative democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representative_democracy ) in a nutshell . 
  how is that different from your national parliament ? 
  because the distance is slightly greater ? 
  that can hardly be the argument in times of internet communication . 
  no , the french and german people obviously have to just agree to being second class citizen with fewer voting rights . 
  our own european 3/5th rule !, 
  of course ... all the people in france and germany should just be dominated by all the smaller countries . 
  it 's good that we finally take population sizes into account . 
  disagreement does n't mean anarchy . 
  you ca n't just ignore democratic decisions because you do n't like their outcome and they inconvenience your country/ideologic orientation . 
  you are free to disagree all you want and change those majority decisions , but in the mean time , you 're bound by them . 
  you can not take all the money and deny the responsibilities . 
   wales could receive much better funding but would it ?
