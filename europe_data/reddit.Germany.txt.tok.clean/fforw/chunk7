  and what about the other us states ? ^ ^ / s, 
   germans are good at demanding others to fulfill their obligations an obligation is a treaty with non-optional concrete targets and penalties for not making the targets , not some declaration of intent like `` we will strive to improve our defense spending towards a goal of 2 % gdp '' . 
  in those aspects we were kind of similar to chinese products . 
  but on the other hand , the quality was very good . 
  which is the reason why the `` made in germany '' warning did not work out as such , but was quickly seen as a mark of quality . 
  pssst . . we germans are bad for invading countries and killing people , while great britain is * good * because of it . 
  dude , you 're the one defending poles for turning in jews because they were afraid for their families . 
  they also knew what was going to happen to the jews . 
  everyone surely knew about the existence of the camps and forced labor . 
  the first husband of my grandmother was murdered in a concentration camp for being communist . 
  she witnessed the jewish neighbors being taken away , their infant just thrown against the wall . 
  of course she did not expect anything good to happen to them , but she did n't know any specifics . 
  what was she going to do ? 
  abandon her two children and take up arms in a pointless fight ? 
  or just keep her head down and try to survive as single mother ? 
  she 's clearly guilty !, 
  edit : i do n't think even the exile assocations would n't call germany `` a victim of ww2 '' . 
  outside of neonazis circles there is a clear awareness about who started the war . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right , though . 
  many germans * were * victims of the nazis though . 
   like previous elections in nazi germany , it was characterized by high turnout , voter intimidation and a massively lopsided result -- [ german election and referendum , 1936 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_election_and_referendum,_1936 ) that election was already largely overshadowed by street violence and intimidation . 
  at the last free elections , the result for the nsdap was [ 37 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_july_1932 ) . 
  edit : not to mention that communists and social democrats were already arrested / in concentration camps . 
  for the election in 1933 , the nsdap was the only party on the ballot already . 
   bashing simple people for not endangering lives of heir family and neighbors is ridiculous . 
  meanwhile the germans supporting the atrocities for the same reason are clearly all evil nazis . 
   interesting , what party 's victory would he actually welcome though ? 
  it 's obviously not an acceptable election outcome if the akp does n't win . 
  that gets you a highschool diploma in the us !, 
  you guys are hilarious . 
  guy kills 69 people , but it does n't matter . 
  instead we should blame every single muslim for the extremism . 
  germany does not need to bury its 1950s policies !, 
  and the 1940s were only half bad . 
  where 's wallace !, 
   stupid incompetent weak traitors . 
  imax level projection . . 
  vienna schnitzel is veal . 
  they are . 
  afd creates exactly the kind of conflict isis wants to create in europe . 
  to pretend that their disgusting self-serving terror regime is part of a big war between all muslims and christians . 
  the only ones buying into that are isis and afd et al. 
  that 's the new social democratic challenger schulz trying to kill mighty mammoth-mother merkel . 
   more likely to commit/or be suspected of a crime so the article says `` suspected '' and you already equate that with them being guilty ? 
  how about the fact that rates of crime reporting vastly differ ? 
  here in germany for example , a german child beating another german child is reported 18 % of the time while a turkish child beating a german child is reported in 31 % of the cases . 
  in a similar vein , people are more prone to being suspected based on ethnicity . 
  it 's not as simple as simply saying `` suspect = criminal '' . 
  that is a common misdiagnosis for an allergy to totalitarianism . 
  terrorists , if you like the word more . 
  the same country trump has business with and which he spared from the ban in spite of the majority of 9/11 attackers coming from saudi arabia . 
  do something 2 . 
  finnish, 
   however , it was agreed to by every member in 2002 and again in 2014 . 
  the first formal agreement or even protocol mention is from september 2016 and is still really vague and non-committal . 
   allies currently meeting the nato guideline to spend a minimum of 2 % of their gross domestic product ( gdp ) on defence * will aim to continue to do so * . 
  [ ... ] allies whose current proportion of gdp spent on defence is below this level will halt any decline in defence expenditure ; * aim to increase defence expenditure in real terms as gdp grows * ; * aim to move towards the 2 % guideline within a decade * with a view to meeting their nato capability targets and filling nato 's capability shortfalls . 
   seems a decent deal if that happens to america . 
  the trade balance of the ming empire might have been a little more in their favor . 
  as i said : feels over reals . 
  there was no general opening of the border , the north african opportunists have next to no chance of being granted asylum or refugee status . 
  they wo n't become legal german citizen , schengen does not apply to them etc. 
  edit : the syrian , for which the borders were `` opened '' , on the other hand are also not granted asylum but are refugees according to the geneva refugee convention . 
  their special status ends when the civil war in syria is over . 
  feels over reals . 
  the perceived problem of too many pakistani and polish workers in the uk is of course the fault of syrian refugees and merkel . 
  does n't have to make sense . . 
  right , so of course , the thing that caused the 4 % is to blame , not the 48 % . 
   one of the main causes of brexit was merkel 's refugee policy . 
  it 's one of the time-machine effects it had . 
  the decision to open the borders in september 2015 not only traveled back in time to cause the crisis , it also went even further back to 2013 to make cameron announce the brexit referendum . 
  . . different legal standards . 
  i think we germans should start complaining about other countries using the most ridiculous words for us . 
  `` german '' , wtf !? 
  we 're deutsch !, 
  tedesco and tyskland are ok , the italians and danes understand . 
  hey . . we 're no saxons , that 's just ignorant !, 
  that would be quite a stretch . 
  sadly , `` baltic states '' also means nothing to a lot of people since in german , the sea is mostly called `` ostsee '' / east-sea , but the states `` baltische staaten '' . 
  maybe we should start calling you more often `` ostseeanrainer '' / east-sea-neighboring . . 
  i was thinking of hume and locke , but the latter was no scot :\\, 
   time to start teaching geography at schools then . 
  when these people where in school , it was the soviet union . 
  point being that the areas where far from being simply prussian . 
  the people sure did think of themselves as westphalians etc , something that did not vanish 1871 . 
  you can just was well call the occupied poles germans . 
   almost 2/3 of the german empire was prussia by both population and land . 
  because the areas were occupied by prussia who [ `` saved '' them after the french invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_campaign_of_1813 ) , e.g. 
  [ westphalia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_westphalia ) . 
  in the end you can blame france as well as prussia . 
  even with just the official numbers , right-wing terrorism caused the most deaths . 
  and a lot of the non-official cases stink . 
   you know unbiased numbers that do n't try to push an agenda like you . 
  you mean cherry picked numbers that make it look different ? 
  i hear you sometimes meet germans on the [ oktoberfest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oktoberfest_terror_attack ) , and some people seem to think you keep being a german in spite of being a social worker or a punk . 
   well rationality was born in germany after all . 
  [ let 's see ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rationalism ) :  pythagoras , plato , aristotle , descartes , spinoza , * leibniz , kant * . 
  well ... ( also : are n't there one or two scots missing in that enumeration ? ), 
   lso , if you just go by number of attacks , the extreme left wing is far more dangerous than outside enemies the majority of german terrorism deaths is by far [ * right-wing * extremists ] ( https://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/news/chronik-der-gewalt/todesopfer-rechtsextremer-und-rassistischer-gewalt-seit-1990 ) .
