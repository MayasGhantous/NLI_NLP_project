  somehow i would have expected jetski to be the express bike messenger equivalent . 
   yet , for international journalists it only took a couple of hours to locate his native village in tunisia and talk to his family . 
  after they knew about his significance . 
  let 's see them doing the same with 1 million plus people . 
  that 's the general backside of all the snooping and data retention . 
  let 's assume a data analysis method that can detect terrorists with 99.9 % probability . 
  you apply that to 80 million people and you have * 80 thousand * cases where you misidentified either an innocent person as terrorist or failed to detect a terrorist . 
  i 'm confused . 
  how exactly differs the explicitly stated policy of killing families as done by the russian from the implicit killing them by drones ? 
   moreover , there is absolutely no panic about it and it does n't have any particularly large media presence . 
  and most importantly , because we approach the problems not with a fearful mindset but with rationality , we 're far more likely not to fall for the emotional manipulation of populism there . 
  all the `` suggestions '' from csu and afd do n't help anyone but the profile of the populist among the easily manipulated . 
   does not deserve the enactment of exceptional regimes such as our emergency state here i think in the very short term it is a useful tool to give the government more control over an uncertain potentially volatile situation , but it certainly should n't become the new normal . 
  yeah . . let 's kill [ innocent waiters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lillehammer_affair ) because they happen to be muslim and we kind of think they 're guilty . 
   irrational maybe we better judge things not by what they are n't , but what they are . 
  not being rational can mean so many different things . 
  homicidal rage is hardly the same as altruism . 
  disgusting were the [ afd-tweets ] ( https://twitter.com/marcuspretzell/status/810941651258580992 ) milking the tragedy when the bodies literally were still warm ... 
  your linked post is a reaction to that . . 
  a large quantity of anti-matter !, 
   there could have been tens , if not hundreds , of casualties . 
  if the kid had had a real bomb . 
  just imagine what he could have done with a nuclear warhead !, 
   you guys who is that now ? 
  in case you mean me and / u/latrinethoughts , we were mocking the rightwing mentality on human rights , not advocating any right violations . 
  no , it 's of course only `` the others '' that should have less rights . . any inconveniencing of the right-wing simpleton and they go full drama / `` oh noes the oppression '' mode, 
  yes ? 
   it would n't really be like the bbc to pull statistics out their ass well . . one of their sources is [ rainer wendt ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainer_wendt ) who heads the smaller of the two police unions who is kind of notorious for being `` colorful , blustering , populist , conservative and always present in the media '' as that wikipedia article puts it . 
  they source their numbers too weakly to really tell their quality . 
  my suspicion would be that they 're talking about accusations of these crimes , not convictions . 
   but that does n't mean that people are returned to their home countries . 
  because while e.g. 
  burglary or robbery is a serious crime for which you should withdraw residence permits etc , the sentence for it is `` x years in prison '' and not `` x years in prison and then death in their home country '' . 
  human rights etc. 
   it is one of the areas in which the us is clearly ahead of us . 
  are they ? 
  what part ? 
  the fetishization of free speech und relative unimportance of basic human rights ? 
  free speech zones ? 
  the decision that company money is free speech ? 
  found a lot of sites going on about the evil jews and walls of text . 
  i want facts . 
  edit : allright . . `` anetta kahane '' is apparently the chair woman of the [ amadeu antonio foundation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amadeu_antonio_foundation ) . 
  what does she have to do with press freedom ? 
   you refuse to recognize that people want a real change well , at least that 's what the populists say , leaving out some important details , brushing over the fact that people mean a whole lot of different things with `` change '' and have a different ideas of what is it that needs changing . 
  and the populists are feeding it by given them promises just vague enough to let everyone think that their problems will be addressed . 
  a number of economic problems mixed in with pure racism and race purity bullshit . 
  as history has shown again and again , none of these problems will be solved even partially by the populists . 
  as soon as they get into political work , they prove inept and incompetent and in a few years the next wave of populists lies their asses off . 
  who ? 
   how about reddit thought police ? 
  what ? 
   you are speaking about echo chambers sorry . . the world of facts is not an echo chamber . 
  not all things are alike . 
  if there is no maxim-gorki-park , there was no rape in it . 
  and they even went to look for other parks where it might have happened . 
   outpour of joy because of this dumbass in afd sure . . there is lots of schadenfreude over the misfortunes of those bullshit peddlers , but that 's not all there is . 
  people are using these fake news world to attack foreigners , burn down asylum centers and whatnot . 
  it 's a real problem . 
   that will kil trumps , le pens , putins of the world . 
  but sorry . . for those determined to be outraged at fake bullshit , there will be no changing . 
  killing the populists works by realizing their bullshit . 
  realizing that all they can is point at the problems people want to be pointed at , for whatever made-up reason , without any solutions whatsoever . 
  facebook is not news . 
  facebook * does * censor heavily where it [ fits their sensibilities and ad revenue ] ( http://media.news.de/images/das-satire-magazin-extra--liebe-details-ueber-nazis_856306013_323x190_6b2e0e90674b56bd45b5bd3b42976ea5.jpg?images/a6/8d/5ad2bfb36fbaff606823420bba05.jpg,nopic/no_pic.jpg,323,190,,1,8,149,942,554 , , ) , they 're just against filtering here because it would mean less advertisements sold to outraged people . 
  and i did not call for `` filtering the news '' or anything . 
  i just presented problems . 
  not even the government has presented any real ideas what to do about the problems yet . 
  they will at the time , most likely not changing much . 
  the courts will make sure it is legal and in conformance with the basic law in any case . 
  are there any other opinions you want to put in my mouth ? 
  i 'm starting to get a feeling where you are getting your news . 
  of course , the right-wing must be able to lie their asses off or civil liberties armageddon is upon us . 
  facebook is not even press . 
  and as i said before , * they * are amplifying this shit to push their advertising . 
  the more upset people are , the more they earn . 
  i see what is happening here in germany with all the fake news even causing the afd to waste everybody 's time with official inquiries about the populist fake news like [ this official inquiry to the saxon state government ] ( http://imgur.com/enczgrn ) : * was there a rape in maxim gorki park in may 2016 ? 
  * is there a connection to an asylum seeker or did the victim give a description that points to an asylum seeker ? 
  * was this case communicated to the press ? 
  was the press allowed to print it ? 
  * were there attempts from officials or third party to silence the victim ? 
  * what is the current status of the investigation ? 
  answer : `` the questions are not decidable as we are not aware of any maxim gorki-park in saxony . '', 
  this is of course only the tip of the ice berg . 
  a whole segment of the population whipped into a frenzy by pure lies , amplified by the echo-chamber facebook . 
  everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but not their own facts . 
  i have no influence on the freedom of the press since that relates to the state interferring with the press and not the people not buying disgusting drivel and calling a populist spade a spade . 
  i 'm still not quite sure if that answers your question , but a better journalist to interview about this might be someone from a more reputable newspaper . 
  maybe the [ faz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurter_allgemeine_zeitung ) if we want a center-right leaning or [ zeit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_zeit ) or [ s\u00fcddeutsche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%bcddeutsche_zeitung ) for more center-left leaning . 
  i think they 're an evil organization with bad influence on the german public and the political culture . 
  i wished more people would recognize their poison and stop buying the bullshit , but i 'm not sure banning newspapers is something we should do . 
  we could fine them heavily for provable false articles maybe , but these days they seem to be more clever about this stuff . 
  their days of `` whenever he eats fat : student turns into bird spider '' and similar outrageous bullshit are mostly over . 
  these days they 're more careful with their lies and misrepresentations . 
  springer publishes bild , the largest german tabloid newspaper , known for their casual relationship to veracity etc. 
  it 's not surprising that he holds that position . 
  bloomberg , the guys doing the interview . . 
  heh . . springer press boss against measures against fake news , who would have thought ? 
  they should ask rupert murdoch , too . . 
   what else can you describe a combination of non-factually based assertions that are repeatedly debunked and cited and known influence from a variety of sources ?
