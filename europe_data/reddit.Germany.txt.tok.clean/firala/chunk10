  moving to munich soon , that city will be better than stuttgart for bicycling . 
  stuttgart is built around / in a basin , my apartment is on the opposite side from my work , so i 'd have to bike down and up again . 
  too lazy for that . 
  looking forward to being able to bike again in summer . 
  furthermore , we have the typical run-of-the-mill conspiracies . 
  flat earthers , chemtrailers , and people who believe the rothschilds are behind everything . 
  so the icelander / norwegian says sweden is cheap , the swedes look at denmark , the danish at germany , the germans at czechia & poland ... the road goes on and on ... 
  and they 're - from my experience - mostly desperate foreigners from countries where hitchhiking is more common . 
  oh , we have something similar to l'isola dei famosi - dschungelcamp ( jungle camp ) , where they send c grade celebs into a `` jungle '' and make them eat bugs and elephant dicks or something . 
  low resolution , but the best i could find . 
  [ markuskirche ] ( https://www.orte-bw.de/grafik/uploads/6770_2010_1040.jpg ) ( marc 's church ) . 
  according to some documents it was first used around 1049 , however most parts have been renewed and rebuilt . 
  the small building next to it is the public bakery . 
  people can pay to bake goods in old ovens there . 
  not as fancy as the others , i see , but still a wonderful town here . 
  not going to share the name for privacy reasons . 
  it 's pretty small ( 8000 ) anyway . 
  schwarzwald area is a nice addition as it shows the baden style of `` tracht '' ( traditional clothing ) . 
  you can go visit the village brauhaus ' brewery . 
  op , mind that if you visit bavaria ( and baden ) you will miss out on northern germany style of clothing - but i 'm not from there so i ca n't really say anything about that ... 
  if you 're here in summer there are plenty of medieval fairs everywhere . 
  while not everyone is 100 % historically accurate you will see plenty of interesting folks and trades there . 
  some examples : they do lots of scripted reality . 
  - wife ( woman ) swap : two families switch the women . 
  lots of yelling and emotion . 
  most famously known for the `` halt , stop ! '', 
  guy , and `` nadine the brain '' . 
  - wanted : daughter-in-law : weird people get selected to be displayed on tv . 
  then they try to get him a girl . 
  always some sort of nerd of course . 
  currently well known because jan b\u00f6hmermann 's show sent two actors in `` undercover '' . 
  they played pretty weird characters from the start , but rtl managed to exxagerate stuff even more . 
  behind the scenes dialogue from hidden recordings : `` so , how much alcohol do you drink '' `` like ... 6 or 7 beers per day '' ... ... '' so ... 
  i 'll put down `` none '' on the paperwork . '', 
  the way we own up to our past . 
  they are europe 's refugees . 
  greece and italy ca n't take them , they 've got enough problems as it is and they have shouldered that burdon for many , many years now . 
  europe needs to work together , which is why a quota system based on each country 's economic state is a good idea - as long as we work on reducing the amount of all kinds of refugees ( war , climate , economy , political ) at the same time . 
  well , the idea is great , yeah . 
  but sitting with random drunk people , paying five times the normal price for beer , and dodging puke is not my idea of a fun evening . 
  if you want authentic , do n't visit the oktoberfest ( or the wasen in stuttgart , for that matter ) , but small local `` hocketse `` s ( in swabia ) and summer festivals . 
  make sure to learn the article alongside the noun . 
  so do n't learn `` tree '' = `` baum '' , but `` the tree '' = `` der baum '', 
  make sure to learn the article alongside the noun . 
  so do n't learn `` tree '' = `` baum '' , but `` the tree '' = `` der baum '', 
  have n't tried , i think my boyfriend may object . 
  germany : tschechien , or very very rarely tschechei . 
  pretty much the same . 
  yeah , i believe you 're right . 
  occasionally . 
  what irks me is that when i visit the us and meet people , they 're very eager to tell me their connection to germany , or sometimes europe . 
  i am nice and nod , but truly this is what i am thinking : why would i care ? 
  do you think i 'll feel some sorta connection that was n't there before based on that knowledge ? 
  do you think every german knows every other german ? 
  it 's information i do n't care about when we first meet . 
  tell me when i got to know you better , if it 's important at all at that point . 
  do n't be sad !, 
  at least now you know germans know what pizza is !, 
  it 's really quite astonishing . 
  from what i 've seen , they also put a lot of work into their schreberg\u00e4rten . 
  `` egal wie chill du bist , friedrich war ( s ) chiller '', 
  - if hitler were still alive . 
  - if i liked all the muslim dick here in germanistan after t_d regular found out i was a woman also , because they get asked too often - all the fucking `` hurr durr no speed limit '' questions, 
  hummm . 
  ... you could be right . 
  anyway , the second paragraph still stands , 
  wow . 
  really dumb mistake , sorry . 
  because the drittes reich is pretty significant , and the reich before was n't really a reich , but the weimarer republik . 
  the word * reich * is simply negatively connoted in germany . 
  stupid hitler , ruining words . 
  make sure to keep your bags closed and on you at all times . 
  even if you think it 's safe there - having your wallet in your pants pockets is n't a safeguard - pickpockets are damn good . 
  do n't stop for people trying to get your attention with leaflets or other bullshit - it 's a scam to get your attention . 
  example : here at the main station people sometimes stop you to get your signature for something `` super-duper important '' . 
  while they talk to you , their colleague grabs your phone and / or wallet . 
  have a healthy dose of paranoia and distrust in all zones prone to pickpocketing and scamming ( tourist places , public transport hubs ) and you 'll be fine . 
  china to jina . 
  you know , the way trump pronounces it . 
  bohemia would be awesome . 
  then we could go back to calling you b\u00f6hmen . 
  what about m\u00e4hren though ... 
  not in germany . 
  sounds too close to fourth reich . 
  although with the increase of fashionable nazism ... huh . 
  of all the things you can blame us for you choose to mention our * effiziente , platzsparende raumaufteilung * ? 
  awwww . 
  in my opinion , you ca n't really be proud of being of a nationality , because you should be proud of something you achieved . 
  and being german , to me , is pure luck . 
  i mean , my great-grandpa lived in estonia , then went to prussia and my grandpa fled to germany , so technically they * could * be proud - but i ca n't . 
  there was an opinion ~ ~ peace ~ ~ piece ( but for real , we need more peace guys ! ), 
  on spiegel online a while back in germany about a nurse who has to deal with impatient patients in the er . 
  it 's message was : be glad you have to wait , because the ones who ca n't wait would sometimes do everything to switch with you . 
  i definitely mind being talked to without reason . 
  now if there 's something we can both be outraged about - like the train being late or something being broken , that 's a good reason for me . 
  let 's all be angry together !, 
  as long there is no clear definition of intelligence and what constitutes the ability to cast an informed vote , it 's not possible . 
  if there was , i would be very for it . 
  yeah . 
  it 's not like we 're forcing anyone to speak german .
