  tell me a joke !, 
  i love animals and travelling . '', 
  short german `` e '' as in `` eh '' . 
  or `` supermarket '' and `` zeppelin '' . 
  same in germany . 
  we have really weird censorship laws . 
  in traditional educational media and most films you can depict nazi symbols ( especially the swastika ) , but games get censored all the time . 
  i think in wolfenstein they do n't do the bellamy salute and alll that . 
  however , the developers go along with that ( extra effort and cost ) because it 's sold so well in germany . 
  mexico of course . 
  in german it 's better because `` danke '' is two syllables . 
  now everyone : danke merkel . 
  [ dahn-keh meh-rkel ] pronouce englishly, 
   the environment loses big time bigly . 
  no lollygaggin ' . 
  when i was 16 i visited my former host parents ( from an earlier language learning trip ) . 
  when we were at the airport for my flight back they had canceled it and there was this huge line we should stand in to get information . 
  instead , we walked to the original counter and i did my best `` sorri . 
  impression . 
  it worked , five minutes later they got me on the other flight . 
  happy me . 
  i doubt there are many inner-city trainstations that are fun to be at at 3 o'clock in the morning . 
  well , if a naked guy would ask me for directions i would think `` weird , but ... sure . 
  you go , guy / gal , ... that way . '', 
  similar to how mezzo-mix gets produced and sold pretty much only in germany . 
  gulash to me is very thick soup with loads of meat in it . 
  but the only goulash my parents ever made was with deer meat , so `` hirschgulasch '' for christmas . 
  we 're kind of superstitious with technology . 
  lots of old people protested and google said `` fuck it leave those places out then . '', 
  there was this one village where people protested about their privacy online and some website printed their pictures , names and houses . 
  to be honest , if you 've got six days from munich just do germany . 
  every country 's citizens will be very offended if you only visited one city for 2-3 days , let alone multiple for less . 
  munich can be done for three-four days i 'd say . 
  take a trip to to the dachau concentration camp site , if you 're interested in it . 
  you can reach a couple of nice castles like hohenschwangau from there . 
  if you 're into cars and engineering go to stuttgart see the porsche and / or mercedes museum . 
  other interesting cities : dresden , berlin . 
  but again , most cities ca n't be fully experienced in two days . 
  and in a continent as diverse as europe you wo n't find two cities much alike . 
  hahahaha . 
  street view in germany . 
  good joke . 
  quick , attach him to a thing that generates power out of movement !, 
  i think most european countries have to deal with that from english-speaking folks . 
  it 's especially fun when they ask about unskilled work . 
  like i wrote , we read them in english classes , which we had four hours a week . 
  german classes were separate of course . 
  interesting cities more or less on the way frankfurt-munich : - heidelberg - rothenburg ob der tauber ( * the * medieval town ) - n\u00fcrnberg, 
  we learn a lot about english literature in english classes here . 
  so we read macbeth and holes and had lectures on animal farm and 1986 . 
  also we read various short stories on british colonialism , though i ca n't seem to remember the titles . 
  our teacher did the best impression of the three witches in macbeth i 've ever seen . 
  she was amazing . 
  expensive [ apartments ] ( http://fotogipfel.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/stuttgart-1.jpg ) ( go for about a million i think ) in stuttgart-killesbergh\u00f6he . 
  there is a beautiful park and all kinds of shops right at your door though , and you get a nice view over stuttgart and sometimes as far as the swabian alps . 
  this [ villa ] ( https://www.immowelt.de/expose/286ah4x ) goes for 2.5 million , it 's at the popular `` halbh\u00f6henlage '' ( about halfway between surrounding hilltops and neckar river valley ) in stuttgart . 
  hummm ... 
  i do n't agree with merkel 's stances on many things , but i admire her stamina and the strength she shows . 
  she is a good head of state . 
  i am a huge fan of [ gregor gysi ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gregor_gysi ) and from time to time i find myself agreeing with [ sahra wagenknecht ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sahra_wagenknecht ) , both linke ( left ) politicians . 
  to get a student visa in germany you need to prove you have 8000 $ in a bank account somewhere . 
  also learn german . 
  and loads of other stuff . 
  it 's not as simple as some website tells you . 
  check out the wiki on studying on the right on / r/germany . 
  yeah , that 's what i expect to happen . 
  take it slow , expand the idea . 
  with france and germany being at the heart of europe , they 'll be the first . 
  there might be a northern union too . 
  i 'd love for france and germany to become closer . 
  our countries have done so much shit to each other , every step closer is a victory over the past . 
  well , it would take a long , loooong time for two countries as different as germany and italy to become one . 
  i doubt it 's possible . 
  but a federation does n't equal that . 
  you 'll still be de italianos , we 're still ze germ\u00e4ns . 
  smalltalk ... no . 
  usually does not happen without a reason . 
  definitely not on public transport . 
  depends on the person of course , i 'm kinda chatty . 
  reasons i have smalltalked / chatted with people : drunk me on my way home was trying to get a snack from a vending machine ( was stuck ) and elderly person on her way to the airport helped me . 
  chatted on the shared metro ride afterwards about terrible vending machines and outdated tech . 
  germans love to complain , so if there 's something outrageous happening you can join in on the complaining ( like above , darn those vending machines ! ) . 
  but that 's usually older people . 
  this `` cold '' behavior is often noticed by us americans who say we are rude when our service staff / service industry does n't talk to them apart from `` can i take your order '' and `` hello / goodbye . '', 
  the best waiter in germany is the one you notice the least . 
  a true friend is someone i can call and they make time for me . 
  someone who shares big and little things with me and i have a great time hanging out with . 
  so that 's pretty average i think . 
  but ( ! ), 
  you 'll have hard times making friends in germany if you do n't already have something in common with them , so for meeting people join a sports club ( called `` verein '' ) or try to talk to your coworkers more , though the latter very much depends on your workplace . 
  i would n't make friends with the guys at my corporate desk job , although i like them as good acquaintances . 
  edit : if you go to a pub : find your own table , at least if you 're not in the rhineland region ( they 're the most outgoing in all of germany . 
  northerners are even more remote , southerners are in between ) . 
  if there 's no table the wait staff usually asks wether it 's okay for you and the already sitting party to sit together , which normally is not a problem at all . 
  but even then it 's rare to talk to each other . 
  on that note , shoutout to the czech guy and his us girlfriend we met in prague , they were awesome guys to talk to over a lot of beer . 
  i learnt latin in school and i can read most italian and understand the gist of it . 
  i ca n't understand them talking at all , since it 's fast and the pronunciation is very different from how i 'd read it . 
  french is less readable , but from time to time it works , spanish as well . 
  we in europe do n't get decent american beer since we usually have enough of our own .
