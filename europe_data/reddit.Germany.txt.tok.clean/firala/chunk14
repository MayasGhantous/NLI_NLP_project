  hey , ours were in that year as well . 
  gon na see sabaton live in two days . 
  extremely excited . 
  student here so it depends on wether i 'm working or not . 
  work means getting up at around 6:30 -7:00 , dress and go . 
  grab brezeln or a sandwich from the bakery on the way to munch on in public transport . 
  stare braindead at cellphone until i 'm at w\u00f6rk . 
  i thought we were friends by now ? 
  heh , being at the heart of europe does n't help us germans either . 
  but that might have to do with sending shit artists . 
  there are some diners and american-style restaurants . 
  they usually offer good burgers ( heaven compared to what mcd 's and others offer ) and bbq stuff . 
  it 's good , but never great . 
  there are n't lobster or pancake houses around here . 
  because we 're efficient !, 
  even if they speak dialect to each other , they 'll be nice and speak their best hochdeutsch if you ask . 
  goes for all german dialects . 
  and do n't worry , i ca n't understand hardcore dialects either . 
  there was a swiss girl in our guild and when she forgot to mute her mic it was fun for all of us . 
  well , yeah . 
  it 's popular among the tourists . 
  local hotel and hostels not so much . 
  i guess it 's the same in nl ? 
  god damn it . 
  yeah , no . 
  not on bread anyway  i meant cold cuts . 
  like sausages and stuff . 
  many people in germany do n't eat breakfast . 
  if i do , it 's either cereal with fruit or bread with cheese + jam / nutella / ~ ~ cutlery ~ ~ . 
  edit : yes , germans eat cutlery , because germany stronk . 
  i meant cold cuts of course . 
  blutwurst ( blood sausage ) is n't popular anymore though . 
  more and more people shy away from innards and blood food , and many germans are becoming vegetarians or at least try their best to eat less meat . 
  important to note that it 's not just turks , but they are a huge minority here . 
  i did n't say all turkish germans were assis . 
  however , due to social and economic circumstances a lot are living in poorer areas and do not speak good german , resulting in bad education and so on . 
  this goes for most germans with a migrant background . 
  that 's how it was in my hometown . 
  the hauptschule was mostly visited my non-100 % - germans , but those that * did * visit it often adopted these accents and words . 
  okay , so these are the three most expensive ones 10 km around my hometown : [ 1 ] ( https://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/89320385 ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/86138972 ) [ 3 ] ( https://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/89469119 ) they 're all very close to the next biggest city with great public transport , but the towns are rather small ( < 15.000 people ) all seem to have a garden and such . 
  now let 's take a look at the next biggest city ( stuttgart ) , which is n't the most popular in germany , albeit very expensive due to the high amount of intellectuals and engineers working at bosch , porsche , mercedes , etc. 
  ... [ 1 ] ( https://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/89339104 ) [ 2 ] ( https://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/89226934 ) [ 3 ] ( https://www.immobilienscout24.de/expose/89226934 ) damn the last one 's fine ... 
  germany . 
  `` assis '' , from `` asoziale '' = `` asocials '' . 
  there are various variations , like `` aslack '' . 
  usually uneducated and poor people that are still for some reason proud of being dumb . 
  especially weird if you meet 100 % germans that hang out with turkish germans that talk with a turkish accent to be cool with them . 
  german note on backpacking . 
  you can not do wild camping here , it is forbidden almost everywhere , so you should do couchsurfing , hostels or campgrounds . 
  airbnb is not very popular here as it circumvents a lot of laws hotels and such have to deal with and thus are only semi legal ( just like uber , which is forbidden by now ) . 
  check out the sidebar in / r/germany , we got a very good wiki about studying and living here . 
  but please * do * read and research first , since we hate open questions without base knowledge over in that subreddit . 
  this [ slideshow ] ( http://www.frauenzimmer.de/cms/die-20-beliebtesten-hunderassen-in-deutschland-1003784.html ) says : 3rd place golden retriever , 2nd place labrador and 1st place mutts . 
  there are diner style restaurants with good burgers , steak , huge portions . 
  it 's also that media everywhere have started picking up on it since it sells well . 
  mass information age sucks balls . 
  some people still believe we 're nazis , but that 's older folks or stupid folks , the latter do n't count . 
  other than that i was quite surprised to hear about that `` german '' christmas tradition with the pickles on the tree . 
  living expenses depend on the city , but should be around 600 $ - 1000 $ . 
  majority of that will be rent . 
  we have the new stuff as well , but the gross reddit users are students in their twenties so we do n't exactly know or care about new shows . 
  while yes , it 's possible to live without speaking the language , why would you ? 
  you miss out on social life and most things that make out the country you live in . 
  apart from the fact that most people will expect you to at least make an effort to learn the language . 
  it 's short for `` einen '' , 
  two persons going out to dinner is very serious in germany and screams `` he 's totally into you and wants a relationship '' . 
  which is why it 's rarely done . 
  more common is a coffee date . 
  but usually people are friends first and then it kind of evolves to a relationship . 
  the whole concept of dating is very different and i do n't like it personally . 
  is usually meant romantically i refuse immediately if i 'm not into the guy . 
  then they get all defensive `` man , it 's just coffee '' and everyone is pissed . 
  you 're sleeping during the other 45 % i take it ? 
  are you asking when people in our region usually travel or when it 's the best time to visit out region ? 
  roughly the same in standard procedures . 
  there are nice tsa officers , and there are assholes , but you get that everywhere . 
  however , once they have any reason to mistrust you , they 're ridiculous . 
  story time : i visited my former host parents from a language exchange for three months when i was 17 . 
  in newark they pulled me out of line without stating a reason , brought me to a separate area and started questioning me ( after taking my phone from me ) . 
  what i was doing , who i was visiting , why , wether i had money with me , wether i wanted to work there , etc. 
  i was pretty unsure by the time and close to tears . 
  i wanted to call my brother who at that time was living there and my first stop during the three months . 
  the officer started making threats that my brother would lose his visa and so on and on . 
  i was n't allowed to ask questions or contact anybody ( keep in mind my brother was waiting for me ) . 
  almost an hour and more ridiculous questions later they had no other choice but to let me go . 
  but that asshole for sure got off on terrorising a teenager . 
  during the questioning they asked me to unlock my phone . 
  officer looked at it ... gears turning ... `` that 's german '' . 
  `` yeah , i 'm from germany . '', 
  so his fingers find the messages icon and then he asks me to translate my german texts . 
  so , i probably got on some kind of no-travel-list now by complaining . 
  eh , who cares . 
  yes , mouth bags , but `` maul '' is more the mouth of an animal than a human 's . 
  nah , it 's a roast with lots and lots of onions . 
  fucking delicious , i tell you . 
  they 're kind of like big ravioli from swabia ( southwest germany ) . 
  they 're eaten in broth , with sauted onions and maybe some potato salad . 
  if you find yourself in the region , get some `` geschm\u00e4lzte maultaschen '' . 
  if you 're up for something not simple : zwiebelrostbraten or sauerbraten . 
  it 's just gr\u00fcnkohl , not gr\u00fcnkohlsuppe .
