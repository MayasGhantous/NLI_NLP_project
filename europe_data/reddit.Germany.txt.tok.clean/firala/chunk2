  like seriously , unexpected . 
  nothing to do , there 's like 2cm of snow , sorry guys , who could 've known . 
  sucks to be you i guess . 
  eh , but mostly the bahn is very good compared to what i 've heard from other countries . 
  it definitely is beautiful !, 
  two friends and i went camping near ravenna spontaneously last year . 
  none of us speak italian , but we spoke french , spanish and i learnt latin in school , so we communicated with hands and feet and had a great time . 
  people were trying very hard to understand us  when my friend said `` merci '' at a bakery they proceded to sell him baguette though . 
  also , i got a real friggin expensive parking ticket . 
  and what 's up with the narrow streets ? 
  had a wonderful time . 
  fun story : i was very close to the mexican border with my host family and we were stopped . 
  officer : `` are there any non-us-citizens in your vehicle ? '', 
  host-dad : `` yes , sir . '', 
  officer flinched and got serious , then i added : `` do you need my german passport or driver 's license , sir ? '', 
  he just nodded and let us go . 
  same here , friend . 
  same here . 
  it 's not used in southern germany . 
  i was super confused when my 2nd grade textbook used it all the time . 
  like what day is that even ? 
  7 year old me did not like . 
  it 's a tourist attraction : greek earthquakes !, 
  i agree with your point about the pensioneers ( there are still people handing out flyers in front of the main station and they 're all 65 + ) , however the planning of s21 was a complete mess full of obfuscation and obvious lies as well . 
  also bad planning , you ca n't load and unload an ice in two minutes for heaven 's sake . 
  anyway , there was a vote , they 'll build it . 
  hrmph . 
  how would german pitchforks work ? 
  -- \u00df -- \u00e4 -- \u00f6 -- \u00fc no wonder we ca n't protest properly :(, 
  i am so glad they changed internship laws here in germany ... it used to be quite the same , unpaid internships everywhere . 
  since this year ( i think ) all non-mandatory internships lasting longer than three months need to be paid 8,50 $ or more . 
  glad to hear we 're on good terms  but then again , my friends visited prag and reportedly had a blast with the locals , so yay !, 
  it 's not wrong to have air conditioning . 
  but i spent a summer in southern california and arizona and what the fuck is up with having to put on a jacket when going inside a restaurant . 
  cool it down so t-shirt is fine without dying of a heatstroke , do n't make me bring a jacket on a 100f day . 
  politicians wo n't tackle the issue until it 's too late . 
  because no matter what they decide , they will lose a whole lot of votes . 
   beautiful place ... 
  people are moving away from former east germany 's countryside . 
  the cities are okay , i think . 
  berlin is growing more and more popular because of it 's uniqueness and style . 
  but with the rent rising like that it 's also getting more and more exclusive and difficult for students ( who move there because of the `` berlin lifestyle '' ) to live there . 
  you can have it , if we can get elsa\u00df-lothringen back  it 's a totally fair bargain . 
  well , the plural of `` krieger '' in german is `` krieger '' . 
  she 's extremely strong , i agree . 
  and i do n't think she 'll lose the next election - but she might step down the one after ( some people think she 's trying to `` groom '' ursula von der leyen as the next chancellor ) . 
  but with such a strong cdu leader i do n't feel any chance of being properly represented in the government , which is why i do n't like her a whole lot . 
  i agree . 
  i love being able to go to france , austria , italy whenever i want without worrying about visa and stuff . 
  it 's for me the most tangible thing of living in europe ( besides $ ) and without it people will be even more sceptical of the whole thing ( `` what has it ever done for me ? '' ), 
  when have we ever had a good relationship , dear gb / england / i-don ` t-even-know-what-to-call-you-guys-anymore-love-you ? 
  i agree partly . 
  we have to realise people did vote for the nsdap and they did support a great amount of statements the nazis made . 
  we ca n't comfort ourselves in saying they were all oppressed and made to do evil things . 
  however times were different and propaganda is simple to believe . 
  their situation must teach us to always think critically of what people tell us . 
  because complaining is totally cool . 
  but seriously , even the best jobs are seriously exhausting in this heat . 
  to be honest i had a pretty stupid opinion of the whole greece affair before frequenting reddit . 
  i ca n't believe i actually believed german media . 
  the problem is , even proper newspapers are not objective on this whole issue , let alone magazines . 
  tabloids try their best to get bought by having racial slurs and titles like `` make greece pay '' on their front page , it 's disgusting . 
  i never paid much attention to them , but even walking past them you get influenced quite a lot : /, 
  she says we have to do something . 
  that something usually is `` be compassionate , help them '' , but nothing tangible . 
  nothing considering this situation is only going to get worse . 
  i do n't think anyone likes our government ... if only there wer some sort of political system were the people could choose !, 
  apparently you ca n't sticky link posts or something, 
  i 'm sorry to hear that - and i can already hear our right-wing politicians saying the same thing . 
  i hope people will realize giving up personal privacy and freedom is not the solution ... 
  i have about 1200 $ per month , part support from my parents , other part student job . 
  it leaves me at about 200 $ for fun and 250-300 $ for my savings , but i 'll have to move to a more expensive apartment soon , so i things are going to change a bit . 
  the same reason someone converts to christianity or any other religion . . 
  they believe in its teachings . 
  just because you only hear about those asshole extremist does n't mean the religion is n't a loving and peaceful one . 
  the `` plop '' is very important . 
  do n't take it from me . 
  we might have lost the war , but we 're spreading . 
  slowly , silently , * punctually * . 
  ohhhhh . 
  though it was one of [ these ] ( http://png.clipart.me/graphics/previews/179/christian-symbol-fish-icon-isolated-on-white-background-vector-illustration_179922293.jpg ), 
  cool , so we got couple more years before the civil war . _ . 
  they 're politicians . 
  if they stop letting immigrants leave libyan shores , they will be called inhumane monsters . 
  if they let everyone in the eu und their own country will suffer greatly . 
  both options will lose votes . 
  like the other replier said , infrastructure is a problem . 
  a single company would n't be enough , there needs to be a bunch . 
  then streets and stuff has to be built . 
  only then people will stay or move back . 
  my sister-in-law is from a town that 's an hour from the nearest autobahn . 
  nothing there . 
  her parents stay because they do n't have jobs and a beautiful house they ca n't sell . 
  there 's a fish symbol in front of the scooter . 
  as someone else mentioned , there 's also / r/kreiswichs for germans . 
  i was looking for jobs online recently and the websites of bosch , mercedes and so on all `` asked '' me to store cookies . 
  if i do n't agree i ca n't use the site , which is bs . 
  i like trains . 
  i think that 's similar in every other language , too . 
  when managers walk into the office : `` wir m\u00fcssen dringend die ** diversity ** erh\u00f6hen und brauchen mehr ** work-life-balance ** um den ** profit-margin ** zu erh\u00f6hen . '',
