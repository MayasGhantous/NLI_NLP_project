  the song sucked ... they 're still trying to recreate satellite ... 
  do n't worry , france and germany will share our 0 points !, 
  if it 's not our voices , it 'll be our asses taking the world . 
  hah , the world 's complaining all the time our language is so ugly ... , 
  helloooooooo spanish background dancer !, 
  it does n't work for me :( the german commentator is snarky as hell though , i like it . 
  german : `` i guess they still think this is just for fun . 
  oh well , at least there 's something to laugh whenever uk performs at the esc . '', 
  finale is on the 23rd . 
  not if everyone has it ... there were four maximilians in my latin class . 
  also four jessicas . 
  but it does have a royal ring to it , i think . 
  oh , it 's not going to be better over here , really . 
  teflon-merkel does whatever she want and still get votes and right-wing populists are getting stronger as well . 
  all while we 're getting fucked by the bnd working for another country . 
  you could try using a vpn to watch german netflix if you have it , 
  family support , government support ( especially for students ) , loans , etc. 
  also i would n't call cigarettes a european basic anymore , they 're becoming rather uncool . 
  i agree , had i stayed with [ a company with a red font that sells power drills ] i would 've been paid similar , but after experiencing that mess for two years as a student worker i 'd rather not , 
  yeah , could be three , you 're right . 
  well , 750 $ is n't too bad !, 
  where do you work if i may ask ? 
  i like the place i intern at , so i 'm not complaining too much . 
  i realise that that minimum wage is a lot of money for smaller companies . 
  germany : [ rock im park ] ( https://www.rock-im-park.com/ ) / [ rock am ring ] ( https://www.rock-am-ring.com/ ) / [ rock am see ] ( http://www.rock-am-see.de/ ) three rock festivals in center and south germany . 
  they 're quite commercialised , but the line-up 's always great . 
  there 's [ wacken ] ( http://www.wacken.com/de/ ) of course - biggest metal festival in germany , high up in the north . 
  as a metalhead from the south part of germany i always go to [ summerbreeze ] ( http://www.summer-breeze.de/en/start.html ) . 
  there 's also the [ hurricane ] ( http://www.hurricane.de/ ) festival and i 'm sure a lot of alternative/indie stuff another friendly redditor will add , 
  your internship is at minimum wage only if you 're not obliged to do it because of university requirements and if it 's longer than 4 months . 
  because i 'm getting paid shit ( jk , 2.50 $ / h ) for my internship . 
  this might help : https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/136232.html, 
  but they will be . 
  until very recently i worked in automobile micro-electronics and all the new solutions and technology were cloud - and internetbased . 
  which is fucking bad . 
  we can but so much computing strength into such small devices and they 're trying to tell us remote computing is necessary ? 
  i 'm not really into the idea of self driving cars , so i 'm probably biased , but if companies would care for the safety of the systems as much as making money of it they would n't be so keen on `` always-connected '' . 
  it 's the ship german navy soldiers learn sailing on iirc . 
  i feel ya . 
  turns out i ca n't trust my own country after all . 
  and as a german i am very afraid of that shit . 
  parties like the afd ( alternative for germany ) , who are plainly populist right-wing are gaining a lot of votes these days ... 
  muslims , orthodox , christians , [ insert whatever fucking religion here ] can definitely live together , 
  thanks !, 
  could you link the document , please ? 
  you `` know '' ? 
  care to elaborate that ? 
  do you need someone in krakau or in berlin ? 
  and yeah , try the subs vertitto posted . 
  there was stuttgart-winnenden in 2009 . 
  boy killed 15 people and lastly himself after fleeing from the police . 
  young people are mostly university students and attendance is n't always necessary . 
  never was at my courses . 
  so if the weather is as awesome i 'd rather skip a session of boring lectures to get some sun . 
  as for the working folks : with an 8-hour day most people are off by 5 or 6pm , some have flexible hours ( i could leave work two hours early at 3pm if i work two hours more in the next couple of days/weeks ) . 
  and if you 're not in tight schedules or super important nobody will bat an eye if you say `` bye guys , gon na leave early to get some sun '' . 
  edit : + university , since normal school is of course mandatory . 
  i learnt be in classes 5-8 , then all of a sudden ae and in grades 11 and 12 nobody gave a fuck as long as you were consistent . 
  which i 'm totally not . 
  it 'll be in german though . 
  maybe subtitles will be there though , since the video is getting international attention . 
  i think it 's quite unfair that everyone has to `` pay '' for them buying rights to show soccer . 
  i do n't watch bundesliga and champions league , yet i ( should ) pay 17 $ per month ? 
  besides , for poorer people 17 $ ( which is getting raised to 19 i think ) is a lot of money . 
  this should be taken in account i think . 
  that 's pretty typical american , and it 's okay . 
  but it always seems pretty strange to europeans when someone justifies their behavior by lineage . 
  downvotes are part of reddit lifestyle anyway , own that shit . 
  well , hillary clinton is still high up in the polls ... 
  but it 's another thing to condemn the entire african population for it . 
  the netherlands and europe are not unsafe because of this . 
  my life ( as a small-ish girl in germany ) has n't changed one bit since it started . 
  there 's nothing to be afraid of . 
  they * want * us to stop . 
  because they want more people needing help and be ostracized by the countries they flee to . 
  those people are the ones joining terrorist organizations in the first place , so yeah . 
  good job , terrorists , you did it . 
  jeez , you do realize that it is so much easier for a billion dollar organization like isis to fly those people here . 
  of course there might be terrorists among the hundred thousands - but one out of how many - a million ? 
  that 0.0001 % . 
  it is easy to say `` we do n't accept any more `` of these migrants '' when we are in the easy position of having food , a home , friends and are not being bombed out of our lives on a daily basis . 
  i do n't think that 's possible since border control is handled by the german government , not the bavarian . 
  they certainly do want firmer controls , the csu even wants a total stop of immigration . 
  but we will see major changes in the next weeks , of course . 
  i 'm pretty sure numberwise we could handle it . 
  however , the bureaucracy involved is extremely slow , for example the whole asylum process - they used to take multiple days to assess the situation for each individual , now they 're down to decide a lot of cases a day . 
  if the government had prepared for this situation earlier , it would n't be so hard , but well , that 's hindsight . 
  i just wish germany ( maybe europe , too ) would decide to fight the cause , not handle the refugees like cattle because we 're overwhelmed . 
  it 's the beginning of karneval season in germany . 
  or at least in the regions of germany that celebrate karneval . 
  not us germans , we know we were shit !, 
  hey guys , what are you talking about ? 
  take a look at / r/german , too . 
  beware in / r/de because we might be a bit circlejerky . 
  do not adapt the language there . 
  of german nation . 
  ^ ^ pls,

  then i guess we have to teach them that their views are wrong . 
  it 's not impossible to overcome prejudice .
