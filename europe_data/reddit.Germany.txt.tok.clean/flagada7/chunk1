south of n\u00fcrnberg nobody wears them either , apart from two or three days in the end of september . 
  bahaha this one 's good !, 
  adf ? 
  ** a ** chse ** d ** es ** f ** \u00fchrers ? 
  used taxis multiple times from lisbon airport and never got cheated . 
  the key is to use those at the departure area . 
  west germany is same , just uglier architecture . 
  your logic is massively flawed . 
  obviously the less parties that are able to veto the treaty , the less likely it is to be rejected . 
  you do n't need academic citations to realize this . 
  so if it is your goal to get the treaty through , secret negotiations might be the right way . 
  if it is your goal to do a good job governing your people though , it is a horrible way . 
  australians * do * have a soft spot for european music ... 
  what does ze pale , skinny boy want ? 
  he shall go away !, 
  yeah no . 
  exactly . 
  `` catches fire '' ... stupid building , catching random fire and all !, 
  peter prevc !, 
  islamists are not * that * big of a problem . 
  bothersome is the word i 'd use . 
  in the refugee related threads you see so many users `` concerned with germanys future '' , where are they now ? 
  well then the pension was surely enough to live . 
  and even if that guy squandered his small pension on cigarettes , he could still go to a tafel and get free food . 
  i do n't want to sound arrogant , i know there are a lot of pensioners who have to live on a very small amount of money and we need to better the situation of them , but i assure you that nobody has to go to bed hungry . 
  not true.yes some , people are poor , like in every place around the world , but nobody must go hungry if they are not too proud for welfare . 
  there are not many homeless people who did n't choose to be homeless . 
  they often have psychological problems . 
  obviously they need help , but it 's not like there would be no homeless person if they just spent a ton of money on that issue . 
  fortunately we have n't . 
  note that these stats are only about berlin left radicals . 
  [ english source . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-russi%ef%bf%bd-iduskcn0v90xh ), 
  the law just states that certain officials are allowed to use guns . 
  * obviously * this needs limitations . 
  i do n't get the fuss about it . 
  why would this concept be complicated ? 
  just recently someone told me that she does n't read sz anymore , and hopes that at least faz stays reliable . 
  i think both are rather trustworthy . 
  enough for me at least . 
  just how often exactly do you need to read the word `` verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfigkeitsprinzip '' ? 
   it seems to me that what the afd stated is not completely wrong . 
  yes it is completely wrong . 
  the circumstances under which they are allowed to use guns are clearly not given in this case . 
  i did n't include magazines . 
  feel free to add your opinion about spiegel and stern . 
  you ought to take them because you promised to do so . 
  ... and each country should think about the massive eu funds they 're getting for being a member in a community of solidarity . 
  that guy is talking out of his ass . 
  sadly this is the internet , and everything you read on the internet is true , right ? 
  president is more fitting imo , as he is a political actor with representative duties , not just the highest ranking police officer . 
  people from sudan do n't look northern african , there are no refugees from algeria . 
  maybe some from libya , but fewer than regular migrants from morocco , algeria and tunisia . 
  there have never been refugees from northern africa . 
  yeah , let 's build a wall around germany and let the austrians pay for it !, 
  this wo n't get attention here . 
  r/europe does not fail to disappoint . 
  it is clearly stated that suspects are known to the police and have nothing to do with refugees . 
  as someone living between the alps and bodensee : nope , it 's fairly cheap here . 
  probably because of the rather bad traffic connection to munich and stuttgart . 
  22/23 are born in germany and names should n't matter . 
  if the uk is doing well in the eu , nobody would want to leave . 
  the first statement is preconditioned for every brexit supporter . 
  and while you did n't explicitly write the second one , i can already see this as the ultimate face saver for the time after a possible exit . 
  if they stay and do badly it 's the fault of the eu . 
  if they leave and do badly it 's also the fault of the eu . 
  why do you have to put migrants in quotes ? 
  it 's not like they materialised out of thin air . 
  they migrated . 
  based on mostly irrelevant games . 
  does n't matter . 
  there was some sort of violence involved , and we 're on r/europe so it 's obviously islamistic terror and a direct result of germany 's refugee policy . 
   czech republic is n't even eastern europe that 's an opinion you have exclusively in western europe , pal . 
  in this case i misunderstood . 
  i thought you were making fun of the original title for being exaggerated . 
  the phrase `` xenophobic hate crimes '' is perfectly fine . 
  you could also say `` hate crimes against foreigners '' . 
  nothing about it is smashed up . 
  there are hate crimes against other people , too , you know ? 
  the world you see must be oh so simple . 
  i am quite jealous . 
  yeah right , exept that 's not happening . 
  portugal , italy , turkey . 
  some even in germany or other northern countries . 
   how much are you willing to pay for your clothing ? 
  * multiple * manufacturers producing in europe match h&m 's prices . 
  this is no argument . 
  thanks for being the voice of reason here . 
  yes , bad godesberg has a problem with integrating migrants . 
  no , the women in niqabs and burqas are not among them . 
  they are medical tourists . 
  gabriel 's father was an outspoken national socalist , even after the war . 
  gabriel broke off contact with him after learning about it . 
  * of course * those people who feel abandoned by the big parties have to be heard out , integrated better . 
  but afd , fp\u00d6 , sd and co. do n't care for their voters . 
  their economic proposals would make matters even worse for these people . 
  just because it 's allowed , does n't mean it 's a good idea to vote for them . 
  does n't change my point that these parties do n't raise points you can react to . 
  frau kepetry is simply herr kepetry 's wife . 
  the one and only point they raise is `` brown people are evil '' .
