  maybe these people actually flee war and persecution ? 
   sorry , germans , but you 'll have to take these people . 
  or what ? 
  140 euro is probably better than welfare in hungary . 
  start to lobby for a eu-wide solution . 
   and even on bigger scales these past few months can you cite some numbers for that ? 
  we had 200,000 asylum applications last year , in the first half of 2015 we were already at 200,000 again . 
  last year , greece had 9430 applications last year . 
  spain 5615 , italy 64625 . 
  or let 's compare q1/15 numbers . 
  germany 73120 , spain 2030 , greece 2615 , italy 15250, 
  temporary border controls are put in place all the time . 
  be it football matches or g-meetings . 
  if the eu collectively agrees on a asylum policy border controls will end . 
   also i think that every refugee must be given a finger print scan , and that their information must be put into a database to handle this situation countries with external eu borders are already required to do that . 
   if germany and austria can not process 9 days worth of migrants you are funny . 
  9 days ... as if germany was asylum seeker free until a few weeks ago . 
  germany received 200,000 asylum applications last year . 
  almost 1/3 of all applications in the eu . 
  until july this year we had received another 200,000 asylum application . 
  around 40 % of all applications in the eu . 
   if anything , northern european countries said that spain was very , very , very bad for trying to defend its border with africa . 
  pretty much a fascist state , they said . 
  can you quote a few sources ? 
   can they prove where they entered the eu by now ? 
  in that case hungary could just deny the dublin request by austria . 
  `` closing your borders '' does n't void your duties according to the dublin regulations, 
  nord stream 2 is a project of multinational private companies . 
  the german government did n't sign anything . 
  what rules ? 
  the dublin regulations ? 
  a receiving country is in no way obligated to push asylum seekers back to the country of first entry . 
   article 21 -- submitting a take charge request  where a member state with which an application for international protection has been lodged considers that another member state is responsible for examining the application , ** it may ** , as quickly as possible and in any event within three months of the date on which the application was lodged within the meaning of article 20 ( 2 ) , ** request that other member state to take charge of the applicant ** . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2013:180:0031:0059:en:pdf `` it may '' not `` it must '', 
   `` the fundamental right to asylum for the politically persecuted knows no upper limit ; that also goes for refugees who come to us from the hell of a civil war . '', 
  this is literally the gist of the un refugee convention . 
  eu15 best eu . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  which german politician told a greek politician to accept a bribe ? 
  germany is a schengen country without an external border . 
  schengen forbids systematic border checks . 
  we are not allowed to check every train , car and person that enters the country from another schengen country . 
   and greece had to give contracts to siemens and other german companies valued in 10s of billions . 
  they gave these contracts because siemens and other private companies from germany bribed government officials . 
  the problem are corrupt government officials who will hand over schengen visa to people who are illegible . 
  when a country without an external border ignores the dublin regulations it voids its right to send asylum seekers back to the first dublin country they entered . 
  but it was never obligatory to send asylum seekers back into the country of first entry . 
  but not having systematic border checks is mandatory under the schengen agreement . 
  you see the difference ? 
  besides that , for years courts said that enforcing dublin deportations to countries like hungary , italy and greece violates the human rights of the deported . 
  if germany would have enforced the dublin regulations fully we would have received 2,000 asylum applications last year , and not 200,000 . 
   has there been any past tradition of the eu making policy calls in switzerland ? 
  do you know about the relation between switzerland and the eu ? 
  because the gulf countries do n't have treaties with the eu in exchange for access to the single market . 
   i understand women and children , but why men do n't stay and fight for their country ? 
  let 's assume you are a syrian man , which faction would you fight for ? 
  it 's one thing to fight in a war with an external enemy . 
  but in a civil war ? 
  you do n't fight for your country . 
  you fight for the faction you choose . 
  and then you try to kill your neighbors because they have a slightly different believe and are therefor fighting for a different faction . 
  no way . 
   why they riot in european cities , destroying our home and making us feel unsecure ? 
  they riot because they have a plan , and they do n't want to change that plan . 
  and that plan does not end in hungary . 
   why they are not grateful for european hospitality and demand more and more ? 
  because they are humans . 
  wanting the best way for yourself is a very human behavior . 
  they can have protection , the prospect of a job and live in a nice ( as perceived by them ) country . 
  so why stop at a place that offers protection , but neither jobs nor the niceness they want ? 
  they crossed the mediterranean sea . 
  traveling through the eu to the country of their choice is no problem for them . 
   what are they really expecting by coming here ? 
  among many things , safety and a future . 
  not sitting in a refugee camp in turkey or rural romania . 
  but working for a company in germany , earning the big money . 
   why people traffickers told them to cut the rubber boats they arrive to europe on ? 
  because they know that people rescue people who are in distress . 
  that 's human nature . 
  if someone drowns you try to help them . 
  and in that case the people that rescue them are european coast guard or european navies . 
  which bring them into the eu after they were rescued . 
   do they really want to work here or just live on social income from rich countries ? 
  they want to work . 
  talk to them . 
  they really want to work . 
  they believe they can be the turkish gastarbeiter of our generation . 
  work hard and earn good money . 
  the problem is that europe needs way less unskilled work than what was needed in germany in the 70s . 
  social benefits in rich countries might seem plenty if you do n't live in that rich country . 
  if you have to pay rich country prices the 140 $ pocket money wo n't buy you a lot . 
   can syrians and afghans live together in europe ? 
  yes . 
   what is the best solution in your opinion ? 
  there is no best solution . 
  all are shit , some are less shitty . 
  i will spare you the 5000 word essay about all the things i said thousand of times already . 
  i hope they were properly registered in poland . 
  so they have to choose between staying in poland and not getting anything in germany . 
  if you want to talk about betrayal we have to look at the timeline of recent news .
