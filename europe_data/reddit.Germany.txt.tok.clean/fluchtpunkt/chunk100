  and that 's not a program from before 1990 .  if that is the benchmark , the afd is pretty much center-right . 
  sorry , but i ca n't take social commentators seriously if they do n't wear a guy fawkes mask . 
   they barely scraped past 20 % in saxony saxony-anhalt . 
  thankfully saxony did vote in 2014 already . 
  if they have had elections today , at least the 30 % could have been reality . 
  finding a coalition in saxony-anhalt will get very interesting . 
   that 's latest data , i 'm talking about overall accumulated number since 2004 enlargement , uk did n't use their transitional controls at all , which germans kept till 2011 . 
  so what is the total overall accumulated number since 2004 ? 
  it 's not like there was no or only little migration to germany before we had eu freedom of movement . 
  here are the numbers of people ( excluding germans ) who moved from poland to germany : - 2000 : 74,144 - 2001 : 79,650 - 2002 : 81,466 - 2003 : 88,020 - 2004 : 124,629 -- poland joined the eu - 2005 : 146,943 - 2006 : 162,453 - 2007 : 139,967 - 2008 : 119,177 - 2009 : 110,951 - 2010 : 114,726 - 2011 : 163,414 -- freedom of movement between germany and poland - 2012 : 176,367 - 2013 : 189,109 - 2014 : 190,926, 
  almost all immigration rules are created to prevent a massive influx of poor people . 
  because that would put a huge burden on the low skilled job market . 
  nobody cares about culture . 
  that 's why non-eu migrants who want to stay in the uk will soon need an income of # 35000 . 
  they do n't need to prove that they pray to the queen ( i 'm not sure if the 4 richest commonwealth countries actually do this ) and have tea time each day . 
   uk has received a lions share of ee migrants mainly because of the language , if germany or france spoke english , it 'd have been more equally distributed . 
  germany has a higher net migration rate of eu-citizens . 
  according to [ this bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34931725 ) net migration of eu citizens to the uk was 180,000 in the 12 months that ended march 2015 . 
  in 2014 , 810,000 eu citizens moved to germany , while 512,000 moved away , which leaves us with a net migration of 298,000 eu citizens . 
  the uk just complains a lot . 
  a decline of births during and after ww2 ? 
  some of the decline in the 60s can be attributed to the introduction of the birth control pill as well . 
   they should be force to adopt and fulfill the ordinary set of requirements before they 're given the visa deal . 
  do you know what requirements these are ? 
  then people should stop talking about the commonwealth if they do n't want to include the 4 largest countries of the commonwealth . 
  maybe add a footnote :  `` i think it could work , '' said lord howell of guilford , president of the royal commonwealth \\* society . 
    `` we need to welcome our friends \\* with open arms when they visit us , and , in doing so , work to ensure as much free mobility as possible . '', 
  --  \\* rich dudes only, 
  two-speed commonwealth of nations ? 
  or why no free movement for india , pakistan , nigeria or bangladesh ? 
  the uk could totally implement this without leaving the eu . 
  and after 90 days the uk can expel them . 
  sanctions have to be unanimous . 
  and hungary already said that they will veto . 
  do you have any proof that the statement of that one redditor is true ? 
  the heute show has a house ban in the german parliament . 
  so they are probably not conceived as very government friendly . 
  but maybe that 's just a ruse to cover up that merkel herself approves each segment of the show . 
  if you ca n't compete , adjust . 
  if you ca n't adjust , file for bankruptcy . 
  farming is a business . 
  first turkey let them in . 
  then greece let them in . 
  then macedonia let them in . 
  then serbia let them in . 
  from there we have two possible ways . 
  croatia let them in . 
  then slovenia let them in . 
  hungary let them in . 
  at that point there were in the schengen area and countries would have a hard time preventing their border crossing because systematic border checks are against the schengen rules . 
  when the spd introduced the hartz reforms to slash social security and unemployment benefits . 
  including the whole sanction scheme for example , if you do n't look for a job your unemployment benefits will be reduced . 
  if you play dumb during a job interview , your unemployment benefits will be reduced . 
  if you do n't take that 1 $ job ( ~ 1 $ per hour on top of your unemployment benefits ) , your unemployment benefits will be reduced . 
  if you do n't do what the unemployment office wants , your unemployment benefits will be reduced . 
  that 's literally the opposite of `` pandering to the feels '' . 
  find a different field to earn money . 
  here 's what farmers to today : price too low . 
  increase production by 20 % . 
  price still too low . 
  increase production by another 20 % . 
  price still too low ? 
  how does economy work ? 
   if they wanted to study , why did n't they follow the legal way ? 
  because a non-eu citizen who wants to study in germany needs a bank account with enough money to live one year in germany . 
  that would be something between 5000 and 8000 euro . 
  the average afghan has to work between 3 and 5 years to earn that much money . 
  and that 's if he speaks german and passes the test . 
  it 's likely that many of those who `` want to study '' do n't match the education requirements . 
  so these measures should have accompanied the introduction of the euro , but merkel prevented it ? 
  i know she has the magic power to start a refugee crisis months after it started . 
  but now she also has the power to prevent the creation of measures years before she became the chancellor of the eu [ sic ] ? 
   already german youth are asking why they should feel guilt for something their great grandfathers did . 
  the german youth learns the difference between guilt and responsibility in school . 
  that 's why it 's usual not-germans and the german far-right who say things like `` why should germans feel guilt ? 
   in fact if russia does want to destabilise the west right now all they need to do is report actual facts our media wo n't . 
  facts like the story of that russian 13 year old girl in berlin that was raped for 48 hours by refugees ? 
  i do n't hate eastern europeans . 
  i just do n't want to be in a union with their countries . 
  not because they are the scum of the earth . 
  just because our values differ a lot . 
  we are the vegetarian cyclists that they loathe . 
  and we should n't force our values on them . 
  that 's why i hope every single country that is n't part of the eu15 leaves the eu and joins efta instead . 
   i honestly do n't know if there 's a standard procedure underage killers . 
  reminds me of this quote from broken arrow :  i do n't know what 's scarier , losing nuclear weapons , or that it happens so often there 's actually a term for it . 
  you assume that there will be early federal elections where the spd has to surpass the cdu . 
  that 's not necessarily the case . 
  and i would say it would be stupid to have elections and this time more than 100 days of coalition talks . 
  that 's something you can do if you are n't in the middle of eu wide crises . 
  spd , greens and left have a majority in the parliament . 
  they could call for a constructive vote of no confidence where they disapprove merkel and approve gabriel as new chancellor . 
  a csu/cdu candidate ca n't win the vote of confidence without the spd . 
  and if spd , green and left vote together the csu/cdu wo n't be able to prevent it . 
  it might not be the most likely scenario , but it 's probably the only chance for a spd chancellor in the foreseeable future . 
  and if he does his job good , he will be able to score some points for the federal elections in 2017 . 
  the problem is to convince wagenknecht and the left . 
  that 's my point . 
  the current referendum does not take these points seriously . 
  the outcome of the referendum wo n't reflect peoples opinion about ukraine .
