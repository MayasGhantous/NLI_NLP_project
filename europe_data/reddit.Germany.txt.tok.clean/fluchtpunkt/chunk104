  and while they might be able to influence the german position , there are 26 other eu countries who will have a say in the negotiations . 
  so you should have written : i predict the queen will punch you on the nose . 
   our biggest trading partners are all outside the eu , such as china . 
  did that change recently ? 
  according to [atlas.media.mit.edu ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/ ) in 2013 uk 's largest trade destination were the us ( 11 % ) . 
  followed by germany ( 10 % ) , the netherlands ( 7.9 % ) , france ( 6.3 % ) , belgium-luxembourg ( 5.5 % ) , ireland ( 5.2 % ) . 
  only then comes china ( 4.0 % ) . 
  i would call it a prediction rather than a threat . 
  it 's not germany that the uk has to convince . 
  there are 26 other eu countries that will have a say as well . 
  just look how well the ttip negotiations are going . 
  they were supposed to be finalized at the end of 2014 . 
  now they 're hoping for 2020 . 
  and the uk-eu negotiations will be as diffictult . 
  if not more difficult because of hurt feelings . 
  leaving the eu has consequences . 
  in that case the consequence will be that the uk has to trade under wto rules with each and every eu member . 
  and negotiating a new agreement that will be accepted by all parties will be very hard . 
  the uk wants to stay part of the eu single market . 
  but they do n't want to participate in freedom of movement of workers . 
  which is impossible under the current eu treaties . 
  the uk also wants to negotiate its own trade agreements . 
  which is outright incompatible with being part of a single market . 
  german bdi ** predicts ** to leaving ireland in limbo for 5-10 years of negotiations in case of a brexit . 
  negotiating a trade agreement with a country that wants to be part of the eu single market but does not want to participate in free movement of workers while it wants to be able to negotiate its own trade agreements wo n't be easy . 
  i 'm not seeing how the bdi could profit from having a bad trade relation with the uk . 
  i read `` asylum '' instead of `` visa '' in your previous post . 
  but that does n't change anything . 
  people who are likely to request asylum in the eu wo n't get a schengen visa . 
  an asylum application is not a valid reason to travel to the schengen zone . 
  syrians , afghans or iraqis who do n't have a legitimate business in their country will find it ~ ~ very hard ~ ~ next to impossible to obtain a schengen visa . 
  they might get one if they have an entity in europe that is willing and able to guarantee that the visitor wo n't cost the country any money . 
  edit : i read `` visa '' as `` asylum '' in peter 's post almost no country allows the request of asylum in an embassy . 
  not germany , not the us , not the uk . 
  the embassies would literally drown in asylum seekers if instead of paying thousands to smugglers you just had to walk into an embassy to come to germany , the us or the uk . 
  how sure are you that this is possible in the uk , or any other eu country ? 
  there is a thing called diplomatic asylum . 
  and it 's granted if the group that wants to persecute you is literally waiting outside the embassy . 
  for everyone else ( uk version ) :  as a signatory to the 1951 refugee convention , the uk fully considers all asylum applications lodged in the uk . 
  ** however , the uk 's international obligations under the convention do not extend to the consideration of asylum applications lodged abroad ** and there is no provision in our immigration rules for someone abroad to be given permission to travel to the uk to seek asylum . 
  the policy guidance on the discretionary referral to the uk border agency of applications for asylum by individuals in a third country who have not been recognised as refugees by another country or by the unhcr under its mandate , has been withdrawn . 
  no applications will be considered by a uk visa-issuing post or by the uk border agency pending a review of the policy and guidance . 
    source : uk guidance [ applications from abroad ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257377/applicationsfromabroad.pdf ) from [ guidance on how uk visas and immigration makes decisions about asylum . 
  ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/asylum-decision-making-guidance-asylum-instructions ), 
  has outsourcing gone too far ? 
  airlines that fly to the eu wo n't allow people without a valid visa to board the plane . 
  in case an asylum request at the airport is rejected , the airline has to pay for the flight back , so they have a big incentive to not let asylum seekers aboard planes . 
   others should apply the correct way the correct and only way to apply for asylum status in the eu is to enter the eu . 
  there is no way to apply for asylum in the eu if you are n't on eu soil . 
   if they are legitimate refugees , macedonia will let them in . 
  a `` legitimate refugee '' is a person who is persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  the process of determining if a person qualifies for protection under the unhcr refugee convention takes a lot longer than checking passports . 
  and if i only take that part :  `` our goal is to make the procedures more efficient and faster , '' can i claim that germany plans to create more efficient and faster death camps ? 
   left wing euractiv ( sponsored by ec ) what and what ? 
  since when is euractiv left wing ? 
  and since when is it directly sponsored by the european commission ? 
  here 's a unbiased press release from the ec : http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-387_en.htm and the unbiased portal of the eu action plan against wildlife trafficking : http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cites/trafficking_en.htm and of course we have the unbiased full text of the communication of the eu commission as well : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=com:2016:87:fin here 's a long report about wildlife trafficking , only biased if you like to buy ivory dildos or tiger penis pills : http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cites/pdf/studies/illegal%20wildlife%20trade%20-%20final%20report.pdf, 
   i do n't know if deutsche wirtschafts nachrichten is politically biased they are pro-russian , eu-sceptic , populist , click-whores with a love for conspiracy theories ( especially ones that show how the eu will either kill , poison or enslave all of us ) . 
  nobody takes them serious . 
  dwn often outright lies in their headlines and introductory texts . 
  they probably know that their target audience wo n't read the full article anyway . 
  visiting anyone 's home few times only and threatening them with something vague is n't , though . 
  maybe frontex should close the tunnel between greece and germany, 
  fyi : thomas strothotte is not germany . 
  make them feel like they are not in danger ( of being deported ) so they do n't revolt . 
  so the only reason you do n't kill people is because your country has police that is able to enforce the law against you ? 
  did i get this right ? 
  no morales or empathy involved ? 
   also i 'd be curious , deport where italy , portugal , france , romania , germany . 
  to name the top 5 nationalities of foreign crime suspects ( stgb + betmg ) in switzerland in 2014 . 
  for some reason people seem to believe that these laws will only be used against asylum seekers . 
  but eu citizens will be affected as well . 
   not so long ago , the ministry for refugees ( bamf ) claimed that 300,000 refugees were missing , presumably having become illegal immigrants . 
  do you have a link for that ? 
  because the only story i can find about 300,000 whatever from the bamf is about 300,000 unprocessed asylum applications . 
  it 's still 13 % . 
  the other article you read just used 1,000,000 people as calculation base . 
  well ... v4 , in particular hungary , has lost almost 100 % of the people that requested asylum there . 
  we are talking about 200,000 people between q3/2014 and q3/2015 . 
  compared to that , 13 % seem quite small . 
   meanwhile governments monitor our every single step . 
  mine does n't, 
  maybe we can reuse the plans that were made for the humanitarian crisis that was anticipated had greece crashed out of the eurozone . 
  that 's what the government would say to cast fud about the enlightened !, 
  the last part sounds like basically every volunteer army in the world . 
   seriously i do n't understand how greece hasnt begun using lethal force against this tide of people flooding in . 
  they wait until all the internet tough guys that lack empathy and morals , but would totally shoot at asylum seekers travel to greece , rent boats and shoot at asylum seekers . 
  we can always create legislation to prevent the future . 
  maybe he has a very large music collection . 
  from what i 've heard the annotations are interesting as fuck though . 
  at least if you are interested in history . 
  this is about the annotated book . 
  the annotations are really good , which makes it really interesting for people interested in that time . 
  protip for people who think about buying the annotated edition : contrary to rumours spread by scalpers , the book will stay in print . 
  so wait until it 's available for 59 euro again . 
  do n't pay the 150 + euro that scalpers want . 
  there is no disparity . 
  i 'm not sure why this concept is so hard to grasp . 
  italy does not invite asylum seekers , they do n't grant them visa so they can fly to italy either . 
  italy does what the laws they have agreed upon require .
