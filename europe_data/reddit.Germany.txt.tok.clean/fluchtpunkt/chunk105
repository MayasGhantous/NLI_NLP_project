  and that is to process asylum applications of people who request asylum on your own soil . 
  there is no connection between asylum seekers and phds from pakistan . 
  italy does n't want asylum seekers . 
  and they do n't want some phds from pakistan . 
  they ca n't refuse the former if they appear in their country . 
  but they can refuse the latter if they request to come to their country . 
  what would be the difference between efta and that `` economical eu '' that you propose ? 
  according to bild , the bag of cash contained 700 euro . 
  which is less than what the smugglers take . 
  according to bild , the afghans that returned received 700 euro . 
  200 euro for travel cost and 500 euro to re-establish themselves in afghanistan . 
  i 'm not sure what the smugglers take these days , but it 's more than that . 
  practically as well . 
  at least in germany , a forceful deportation comes with a 5 year schengen ban . 
  such a ban is registered in the schengen information system , where all eu countries can see it . 
  that entry also included fingerprints . 
  i 'm not sure what the current state of the sis is , but there was a time when it was technically impossible to search for fingerprints . 
  so you could only use them to verify an identity . 
   i do n't know how we learn languages in the netherlands then https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subtitle_ ( captioning ) # / media/file : dubbing_films_in_europe1 . png, 
   i love how they seem really angry even when saying things like i love you is this based on videos you saw on youtube ? 
  the ministry of justice has plenty english [ translations ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/teilliste_translations.html ) . 
  many laws , for example the [ criminal code ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html ) , the [ ordinance on accommodation and recreational facilities for crew members on board of merchant vessels ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_seeunterkunftsv/index.html ) , or even the [ act implementing the unesco convention of 14 november 1970 on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import , export and transfer of ownership of cultural property and implementing council directive 93/7/eec of 15 march 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_kultg_r_ckg/index.html ) are available . 
  some of them might be slightly outdated though . 
  and unfortunately the rindfleischetikettierungs\u00fcberwachungsaufgaben\u00fcbertragungsgesetz is not available , but that might just be because it was replaced . 
  if you want to stay strictly at the word yes , we use the colloquial alternatives * jo * and * yep * for * ja * as well . 
  and suddenly every eu country wants to contribute multiple frigates to standing nato maritime group 2 . 
  fuck your editorialization . 
  --  each school morning in the foyer marienthal , children set out for the 600 metre walk to the bus stop to go to school . 
  for six-year-old amir , who suffers from pains in his legs , the walk is difficult , particularly when it is cold and wet . 
    his father , saif , an iraqi refugee , can not understand ** why the children must walk to the bus stop to take the bus when it drops them off at the door of the foyer at the end of the day ** . 
  sound like a reasonable opinion . 
  -----  the bins are filling up with uneaten food in the foyer maternit\u00e9 in strassen . 
  this , says nasreen hassan , is because residents are tired of seeing the same food served for lunch and dinner . 
    ** also , he says , some residents are unable to be at the foyer canteen for the rigid mealtimes because they are out at certain times of the day for appointments with doctors , language classes or other things . 
  **   `` why can we not cook for ourselves and eat when we feel hungry ? '' he asked . 
  `` even if it was just once a week ? '' . 
    ** in some foyers , cooking facilities are provided to residents , ** along with a weekly food allowance . 
  sounds reasonable as well . 
  -----  all residents have access to laundry facilities according to a schedule . 
  hind explained that the schedule is not always convenient for her , however . 
    ** `` sometimes i am at language school and can not be at the foyer at the allocated time '' . 
  ** and another reasonable opinion . 
  but i guess `` strict rules '' are more important than learning the language . 
  it 's alphabetically . 
  they should have named their country zypern instead . 
  -- seriously , it 's not only afghans who get deported . 
  germany mostly deports people to the west balkan countries . 
  because their governments could be convinced to take their citizens back without creating artificial hurdles . 
  and it looks like afghanistan is now on that list as well . 
  prolonging the german contribution to nato 's resolute support mission and continued financial support were probably used to convince the afghan government . 
  oh and asylum is for people who are persecuted because of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  not for people from war-zones or from fucked up countries . 
  did you seriously just extrapolate the extrapolated number of 4000 to 100,000 ? 
   foreign ( non-eu ) students pay fully for their education that depends on the country and the university . 
   they traced a number of cell phones to a refugee center that first week . 
  that was the end of it . 
  they did n't go in , do searches , nothing . 
  any source for that latter part ? 
   imagine 300k + a year turks wandered into your country , worked hard but made it harder to get a better paid job !, 
  or even worse . 
  300k + brits . 
  we would all drown in a sea of tears . 
  booohooo immigration . 
  so bad . 
  all these workers taking our jerbs and houses . 
  eu -  uk net migration in the year ending june 2015 : +180,000 eu -  germany net migration in 2014 : +339,000 . 
  ( and first 9 months of 2015 14.5 % higher than first 9 of 2014 ), 
  one of the dozen or so 17th bundesland . 
  mallorca will always stay the 17th bundesland of our hearts though . 
  indeed . 
  admit the mistakes of the 2000s and back to eu15 . 
   are we now calling finance ministers `` uninformed '' ? 
  only finance ministers that stayed in office for less than a year . 
  not being able to decide on immigration does though . 
  and being part of the eu single market means to agree to , among others , freedom of movement for workers . 
  like the last one , it was most likely developed by a company that sells such things to law enforcement . 
  probably [ digitask ] ( http://www.digitask.de/ ) again . 
  here 's something from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaos_computer_club#staatstrojaner ) about the previous version :  the staatstrojaner ( federal trojan horse ) is a computer surveillance program installed secretly on a suspect 's computer , which the german police uses to wiretap internet telephony . 
  this `` source wiretapping '' is the only feasible way to wiretap in this case , since internet telephony programs will usually encrypt the data when it leaves the computer . 
  the federal constitutional court of germany has ruled that the police may only use such programs for telephony wiretapping , and for no other purpose , and that this restriction should be enforced through technical and legal means . 
    on october 8 , 2011 , the ccc published an analysis of the staatstrojaner software . 
  the software was found to have the ability to remote control the target computer , to capture screenshots , and to fetch and run arbitrary extra code . 
  the ccc says that having this functionality built in is in direct contradiction to the ruling of the constitutional court . 
    in addition , there were a number of security problems with the implementation . 
  the software was controllable over the internet , but the commands were sent completely unencrypted , with no checks for authentication or integrity . 
  this leaves any computer under surveillance using this software vulnerable to attack . 
  the captured screenshots and audio files were encrypted , but so incompetently that the encryption was ineffective . 
  all captured data was sent over a proxy server in the united states , which is problematic since the data is then temporarily outside the german jurisdiction . 
    the ccc 's findings were widely reported in the german press . 
  this trojan has also been nicknamed r2d2 because the string `` c3po-r2d2-poe '' was found in its code ; another alias for it is 0zapftis . 
  according to a sophos analysis , the trojan 's behavior matches that described in a confidential memo between the german landeskriminalamt and a software firm called digitask ; the memo was leaked on wikileaks in 2008 . 
  among other correlations is the dropper 's file name scuinst.exe , short for skype capture unit installer . 
  the 64-bit windows version installs a digitally signed driver , but signed by the non-existing certificate authority `` goose cert '' . 
  digitask later admited selling spy software to governments . 
    the federal ministry of the interior released a statement in which they denied that r2d2 has been used by the federal criminal police office ( bka ) ; this statement however does not eliminate the possibility that it has been used by state-level german police forces . 
  the bka had previously announced however ( in 2007 ) that they had somewhat similar trojan software that can inspect a computer 's hard drive . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  where exactly are we lacking ? 
  what would you suggest to do ? 
  if asylum seekers in europe do n't want to come ; the unhcr would be happy to resettle a couple thousand refugees from camps to portugal .
