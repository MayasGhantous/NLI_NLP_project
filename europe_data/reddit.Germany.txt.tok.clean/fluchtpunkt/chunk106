  that 's what the [ court of justice of the european union ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm ) is for . 
  you either fight your case in a court of the violating country and if you are not satisfied with the decision you take the case to a higher instance . 
  or you complain to the [ general court ] ( http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/jo2_7033/presentation ) directly . 
  freedom of press does n't mean that you have to publish every single opinion . 
  it means that you can report whatever the fuck you want . 
  but i guess some `` freedom '' of press proponents would prefer if the government guarantees a balanced media . 
  since the url says germany-highest-surplus-since-reunification-in-2015 i would say they changed the article to something completely different . 
  the european side ( i.e. 
  : e.on , omv , shell , wintershall , engie ) does the project because of economic reasons . 
  if they start today to reform their countries , not before 2050 . 
  in my opinion the last enlargements were already a decade , if not more , too early . 
  the eu should realize that it 's not only a free trade area but a union of common values . 
  if a country does n't like these values it should stay the fuck out . 
  and with values i do n't mean the nice cash that will be given to poor eu countries . 
   if france and germany disagree on anything then france can always get enough votes from spain and italy ( without anyone else ) to get their way . 
  without anyone else ? 
  26 % of the votes is not even close to `` get their way '' . 
  even more so for the eu dictatorship duo germany and france and their impressive 23 % that they use to decide everything in the eu . 
  maybe , just maybe , proposals find a majority in the ep because they are good . 
   without the records , the germans ca n't send them back . 
  depends where they are registered . 
  good luck convincing the relevant court that asylum seekers who were apprehended in freilassing ( on the austrian border ) entered germany via a country that is not austria . 
  and if the german police registers them right at the border ( which i think they do ) , not registering their fingerprints is n't enough to avoid dublin relocation . 
   i do n't expect the eu will erect trade barriers with the uk of course not . 
  we 'll trade under wto rules until the inevitable negotiations for a free trade agreement are finished . 
  the eu has , plans to have or wants to have ftas with [ half the world ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/eu_free_trade_agreements.png ) . 
  it 's stupid to believe that the eu would not grant the uk one , just to `` punish '' them . 
  so 1 year below the age where they have to be treated as adults . 
   we may actually be able to profit off of this if the uk decides to use ireland as a bridge into the eu market and vice versa . 
  and that 's precisely why individual eu members are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements . 
  these are two different types of cost . 
  most of the cost of hosting refugees and asylum seekers will flow back into the economy pretty much immediately . 
  that cost is also paid from government budget . 
  there 's no such effect if you pay people to wait at border checkpoints . 
  and these costs are n't paid from the government budget . 
  neither macedonia , serbia nor croatia are part of schengen . 
  if not being part of the schengen zone stops asylum seeker , there should be none in schengen countries that are n't greece . 
  non-germans are very lazy , did n't you know ? 
  the us invoked nato article 5 after 9/11 . 
  would be quite interesting if turkey would do the same . 
  do you think the uk will create a visa requirement for eu citizens after they leave ? 
  the uk is not in schengen . 
  they look at everyone who enters the country anyway . 
  so if they do n't require visa from eu citizens in the future , nothing will change . 
   we tried to federalize europe all together we did what ? 
  actually ... 
  according to the un refugee convention , merely being from a war zone does not qualify a person for protection , i.e. 
  asylum . 
  for some reason people have that backwards and they believe that asylum exists to protect people from war . 
  it does n't . 
  that 's not what asylum is for . 
  asylum is for people who are persecuted because of their believes . 
  not a single neo nazi will go to jail if he says `` these are not humans . 
  these are criminals '' . 
  not . 
  single . 
  one . 
  english article : http://www.dw.com/en/planned-refugee-shelter-in-eastern-german-town-of-bautzen-set-on-fire/a-19063792, 
  the leave-voters will be pissed . 
  for the average brit , migration from eu citizens is probably one of the most important reasons to vote to leave . 
  and if the uk wants to be more like norway or switzerland they have to allow freedom of movement for workers as well . 
  but it looks like nobody told that to the brits . 
  i 've talked to brits who oppose freedom of movement , and then said that norway shows that life outside the eu is possible . 
  the uk will probably try to negotiate their own accession deal without freedom of movement . 
  which hopefully wo n't happen . 
  yes . 
  without the greatest empire of the world , the eu is just germany and a bunch of untercountries . 
  we will disband on the spot . 
  it 'll happen on 24 june 2016 . 
  without the greatest of nation in our club , the whole project does n't make sense any longer . 
  jeez . 
  and i thought `` america \\ # 1 '' is annoying . 
  you wo n't have a healthy economy if hundred-thousands of businesses lose the money they have in their bank accounts . 
  i did n't get a vote . 
  why does the average brit get a vote , while the average eu citizen does n't get a vote ? 
  then sue . 
  and as ~ ~ greece ~ ~ tsipras , ~ ~ poland ~ ~ kaczynski wo n't risk to actually sue in front of an international court . 
  because if they do , they risk to lose , and then their voters will see that they are populist bullshitters instead of the stronk men they want to be . 
  the other eu countries should have a referendum on 22nd of june to decide if we want to let the uk stay in the eu . 
  according to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/renewable_energy_statistics ) waste only includes renewable waste :  renewable energy sources include wind power , solar power ( thermal , photovoltaic and concentrated ) , hydroelectric power , tidal power , geothermal energy , biomass and ** the renewable part ** of waste . 
  -- there are different ways to turn biomass into energy . 
  some of them burn the biomass directly , i.e. 
  my wood-fired oven . 
  some of them capture biogas ( i.e. 
  methane as its main component ) . 
  some create biodiesel . 
  there are also things like wood gas generators .

  unfortunately we wo n't be able to put in the emergency break for eu citizens from countries that also have an emergency break in place , read : brits . 
  it would be great if we were able to punish brits only . 
  no need to take away the benefits of hard working citizens from other eu countries . 
  because it 's irrelevant . 
  the uk is not required to pay anyone who is n't a worker a single cent of benefits . 
  same in germany , italy and every other eu country . 
  this is all about in-work benefits . 
  benefits you get while you work . 
  every person who legally works in germany has access to these benefits , you do n't even have to be a eu citizen .
