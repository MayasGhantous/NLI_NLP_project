  if you earn too little you receive housing allowance . 
  if you have children you will receive children allowance . 
  that 's literally how it works in every country in the eu , at least for eu citizens . 
  if there are in-work benefits for native citizens , every eu worker has access to them as well . 
  if you go to the uk you wo n't get benefits either . 
  but if you start working in the uk you currently have access to in-work benefits . 
  and if you start working in germany you have access to in-work benefits as well . 
  housing allowance would be available for you if your income would be below the threshold . 
  and children allowance would be paid if you had children . 
   ... that deliberate mispronuciation thing is interesting . 
  same is done by icao . 
  three is pronounced like tree ( so germans do n't say sri ) four like fow-er ( to distinguish from for ) five like fife ( no do n't fire ) nine like nin-er ( so germans do n't understand nein , i.e. 
  no ) -- and in german , you usually say zwo in radio communications instead of zwei . 
  because zwei ( two ) and drei ( three ) sound similar . 
  we have a standard for our `` colloquial '' version , din 5009 : - anton - \u00c4rger - berta - c\u00e4sar - charlotte - dora - emil - friedrich - gustav - heinrich - ida - julius - kaufmann - ludwig - martha - nordpol - otto - \u00d6konom - paula - quelle - richard - samuel ( probably more common but not official : siegfried ) - schule - eszett - theodor - ulrich - \u00dcbermut - viktor - wilhelm - xanthippe - ypsilon - zacharias ( probably more common but not official : zeppelin ), 
  and if you do n't count the ones where the terrorist killed himself with his gun ? 
  why go to china ? 
  to have the visual and social experience you can just invite a couple chinese over to your apartment where you all watch a documentary about china and eat some chinese takeout . 
  cheaper and faster . 
  and unlike in real china , you might even understand each other . 
  so after the brits vote to stay and the emergency break is activated , it will only be 7 years until the next referendum . 
  what about that dude in vatican ? 
  will he be able to go on stage as a religious leader in austria , without being able to speak german , without having a certificate from the austrian authorities and without being nominated by austria ? 
  and what if austria wants a different guy as the big boss of the catholic church , because they do n't like what he preaches ? 
   they should be certified and nominated by the state is that compatible with religious freedom ? 
  it 's suspended since 2011 . 
  but if the parliament declares a `` state of tensions '' or `` state of defence '' , every german man between 18 and 60 can be conscripted . 
  did n't you know that they are currently oppressed by brussels ? 
  if you base immigration policy on the human aspect you could just let everyone stay . 
  economic migrants have plenty of sob stories to tell as well . 
  do n't underestimate the great military might of belarus !, 
  i still do n't get it . 
  either croatia is capable of closing its border or it is not . 
  if it 's capable of doing so , they could do it right now . 
  no matter what germany does . 
   could n't find the documentary , but found a news article about it which does not mention schools . 
  and why not ? 
  shadowing is a fun game that everyone enjoys . 
   trade agreements pre date `` union '' agreements . 
  does n't matter . 
  by definition individual countries of a single market can not have their own trade deals . 
  trade does not need a trade agreement . 
  there are wto rules which forbid things like unreasonable tariffs 2 . 
  the eu will not put the uk under an embargo . 
  so every eu country can trade with the uk under wto rules 3 . 
  individual eu countries are not able to negotiate their own trade deals . 
  the eu is a single market , and every product that is legally ( i.e. 
  regulations met , taxes and tariffs already paid ) imported by a eu member is treated as an internal product , hence no tariffs in other countries . 
  and if individual members could make trade deals they could circumvent all eu import regulations and tariffs in other countries . 
  these sovereign nations should have read what they signed up for . 
  eu members ca n't negotiate trade deals , the eu has to do that . 
  and if you think about it for a minute , that 's the only thing that makes sense . 
  considering that austria is so generous to let 1.1 million people pass yearly , everything will be awesome soon . 
  and by `` germany '' you mean private businesses from four or five countries . 
  freedom of movement has nothing to do with schengen , though . 
  from the article :  `` we ca n't negotiate with the terrorists of the isil , but if we were able to reach an ** agreement ** between anti- and pro-assad forces on a kind of no-fly zone , in the sense of a sanctuary for the many refugees , then this would save many lives and aid the political process about syria 's future , '' she said . 
  maybe the savings come from not needing an eu flag in front of the building that hosts the intergovernmental emergency coordination agency . 
  most of the foreigners in switzerland are eu citizens . 
  that argument does n't hold . 
  the consequences of a conviction have always been different for citizens and non-citizens . 
  citizens never face deportation , depending on the law , non-citizens do . 
  even in the eu , countries are allowed to expel people from other eu countries if they are a safety concern . 
  though the swiss proposal goes way further than anything we have in the eu . 
  which might become a problem for switzerland , because eu freedom of movement only allows to expel people who continue to be a security risk . 
  you ca n't expel people just because they were a security risk before . 
  the country actually has to prove that they continue to be a risk to public safety . 
  wait until you learn about the asylum policies of the person that would replace her . 
  hint : he 's currently vice chancellor . 
  who has estimated 13 million asylum seekers in 2016 ? 
  that 's just ridiculous .

  which restrictions would that be ? 
  besides things like anti-personnel mines , cluster munitions and nuclear , biological , or chemical weapons . 
  which are self-imposed . 
  and what does this have to do with reconnaissance jets being shadowed by russia ? 
  what ? 
  according to the central firearms registry 1.45 million people owned 5.5 million registered firearms in germany in 2014 . 
  that 's like 7 legal firearms per 100 . 
  i doubt that there are 23 non-registered and/or illegal firearms per 100 people . 
  [ source ( german ) ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/politik/auch-legale-waffen-toeten-article12090366.html ), 
  they are clearly talking about the vegetarian cyclists that the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ west brought . 
  because he 's not a pole who insists on poland being in central europe . 
   major cost drivers for european companies are ( in some countries ) the energy costs and co2 emission costs . 
  chinese companies can skip these for a large part , allowing for unfair competition . 
  that 's not unfair competition . 
  that 's just competition . 
  otherwise every single product that is imported into the eu would be unfair competition . 
  the unfair part happens when china or russia subsidize steel makers by paying them to export steel . 
  so similar to what the eu did with agricultural products . 
  since refugees do n't live in fenced off camps , integration is important ( but unrealistic ) from day one . 
  there 's got to be a joke in there somewhere ... 
  in other threads you insist on saying migrants instead of refugees . 
  or more [ specific ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3s5ghs/germany_unable_to_house_300000_refugees/cwuoz6t ) , `` until their status is clarified they are migrants '' [ and not refugees ] . 
  so now migrants and asylum seekers are the same again ? 
  make up your mind . 
  the press just used the so very important distinction between migrants and real refugees , that are always highly voted on \\ / r/europe . 
   not everything has to be put into law , and not all dislikes have to be legislated . 
  you just do n't sell to shitty people hans . 
  tell that to piotr ...  poland has asked the european commission to send a formal complaint to the world trade organisation ( wto ) over the russian ban on imported eu food products that has hit poland particularly hard , the polish economy ministry said on tuesday ( 19 august ) . 
     so far the commission been cautious about taking the embargo case to the wto , with lawyers in brussels advising it could escalate a trade conflict with russia over ukraine .
