  the snmg2 will do monitoring and surveillance of smuggler activity in the aegean sea . 
  that is the exact same thing that [ eu navfor med ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_navfor_med ) ( operation sophia ) is doing between libya and italy . 
  but the snmg2 operation will use that information to help the turkish coast guard stop smugglers , while operation sophia has no direct effect ( yet ) . 
  as quickly as the generous country that protects us unarmed europeans got help when they invoked article 5 . 
   and have a reasonable amount of leverage . 
  stuff like the autobahn-toll for foreigners was not wanted by any of the other parties but were vehemently pushed through by the csu because the other parties knew what would happen . 
  how many foreigners currently pay autobahn-toll ? 
  that 's right , not a single one . 
  because the eu investigates the law , because it discriminates other eu citizens . 
  that 's how important the csu are . 
  they were allowed to push through legislation that would be invalided by eu courts . 
  and everybody knew that this would happen . 
  it 's the first time since basically forever that such a proposal is worth discussing . 
  because it appears that turkey is willing to cooperate with the eu to stop the massive influx via the aegean sea . 
  before the current eu-turkish negotiations and the request for nato assistance it would have been just another of these smart-ass suggestions like `` just close the border '' . 
  as we told putin , a country ca n't simply violate the sovereignty of another country . 
  we all know what italians do when they are on a sinking ship . 
  they ~ ~ leave as soon as they can ~ ~ slip and fall into a lifeboat . 
   i wonder how far they would be prepared to push into russia though in a worst-case scenario ? 
  not very far i guess , at least if we 're talking about a conventional war . 
  moscow is pretty close . 
  and any aggressive advancements into the direction of moscow will turn the conflict into a nuclear war . 
  according to eurostat the czech republic has the lowest unemployment rate in the eu . 
  sounds like the incentive to work is there . 
   at this point ? 
  i would honestly take putin over merkel and the rest of the eu . 
  maybe you can request asylum in russia ?!, 
   and being shat on constantly when our people migrate to there legally do you have a quote from merkel or any other german person that matters ? 
  since they abolished slavery you ca n't send workers anymore . 
  the countries have to work to attract workers from other eu countries . 
  which will be hard . 
  because if the unemployed worker from spain , greece or even romania is moving to another eu country , why should he move to the czech republic if he can move to the uk or germany as well ? 
  unemployment rates are similar in the three countries . 
  but wages , which is important if you ever intend to return , are not . 
  that 's how i understand it as well . 
  and in every nato country along the eastern border there will be a small contingent of nato troops that are rotated . 
  similar to how baltic air policing works today . 
  i guess we 'll know more once the nato defence ministers meeting is over . 
  -- but nato strategy for deterrence seems to be a small forward presence and the ability to reinforce quickly . 
  not sure where i read it , but the majority of the recently announced investments of the us army in europe will actually happen in germany and not in more eastern countries . 
  the weapons will be stored in germany . 
  because the good transport infrastructure would allow nato ( or in this case us troops ) to reinforce everywhere along the eastern border . 
  so the ger in reforger will stay the same , and in case of a conflict between ~ ~ warsaw pact ~ ~ russia and nato , us troops will be deployed to germany , where they pick up weapons and move eastwards . 
  military posturing is the language russia understands very well . 
  to prevent a totally not-russian but local green men `` crisis '' in the eu , we have to be prepared to defend the eu . 
  and for that we need nato and eu tripwire forces in these countries . 
  after the paris attacks we already know what happens if a eu member does n't want to trigger article 5 but requests help on the eu channels . 
  many proclamations of solidarity with very few actual contributions . 
  if only we had a ** e ** uropean ** f ** ree ** t ** rade ** a ** ssociation that britain could join , or better rejoin . 
   this is getting pretty insane   you got someone you do n't like ? 
  just put out keylogger and post mean things under his name , better yet create account under his name . 
  just get prepaid to post or something similar and you are set . 
  you know how you can achieve that much more effective ? 
  do the same thing with child pornography . 
  if it reveals how little poland values freedom of expression , freedom of press , non-state controlled media and other european traits , i wish to incite as much anti-german sentiment as possible . 
  and the satire is currently doing a wonderful job . 
   rather they found a unique way to raise public awareness regarding the refugee crisis . 
  that is the fucking definition of terrorism . 
  here 's the uk definition of terrorism :  ( 1 ) in this act `` terrorism '' means the use or threat of action where :   ( a ) the action falls within subsection ( 2 ) ,  ( b ) ** the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public and **  ( c ) ** the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political , religious or ideological cause . 
  **   ( 2 ) action falls within this subsection if it :   ( a ) involves serious violence against a person ,  ( b ) involves serious damage to property ,  ( c ) endangers a person 's life , other than that of the person committing the action ,  ( d ) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public or  ( e ) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system . 
   there 's also a huge political cost in that we have an entire continent that we have to look out for , which eats up political capital and attention to other issues . 
   [ ... ]  the most significant hidden cost though is the security guarantee that we provide to other countries . 
  that puts us at constant risk of becoming entangled in some foreign conflict no matter how far away it is . 
  tell me about it . 
  a friend of mine died in the war that started after the entire continent we have to look out for invoked article 5 . 
  it 's almost like nato is a mutual defence alliance and not an alliance where the us protects defenceless europe . 
  they do . 
  25 bulgarians have requested asylum in germany in 2014 . 
  and 80,069 made use of freedom of movement to migrate to germany in the same year . 
  source : [ migrationsbericht 2014 , page 244 and 254 ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/migrationsberichte/migrationsbericht-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  says someone from the european country that is the furthest away from russia . 
  school holidays during winter . 
   prime minister alexis tsipras told german chancellor angela merkel that any nato involvement should be restricted to the turkish coast and guarantee greek sovereign rights . 
  if greece even has fears when nato is operating in their territory i have a counterproposal . 
  nato involvement will be restricted to albania and bulgaria , and if they want help from nato ( which they probably do ) , macedonia . 
  that should make everyone happy . 
  the asylum seeker influx to the other european countries is slowed down . 
  and greece does n't have to fear a covert nato invasion . 
  case by case . 
  however , the migration authorities of a state usually follow the decision of a higher instance ( which the court that just ruled is not ) of a administrative court in that state . 
  but it 's very unlikely that this ruling has an effect on another german state . 
  what 's noteworthy ? 
  in 2014 , 67,799 people moved to germany from the americas . 
  among them 5,613 from canada and 31,861 from the us . 
  so 30,325 people from countries in central ( including mexico ) and south america and the caribbean . 
  among them 10,872 from brazil ( not necessarily brazilian citizens ) and 5,600 from mexico . 
  unfortunately the statistics does n't show the country of origin of the other 13,853 unaccounted immigrants . 
  and about hearing about migration . 
  you generally do n't hear about regular migrants at all . 
  okay , the uk is an exception , they whine pretty loud about regular migration as well . 
  you hear about asylum seekers , but that 's basically it . 
  did you know that in 2014 , 1.34 million ( 2013 : 1.11 million ) people ( excluding germans ) migrated to germany ? 
  810,000 ( 2013 : 708,000 ) of them were eu citizens ( excluding germans ) . 
  outside of far-right groups nobody cares about these migrants . 
  they do n't get much media attention either . 
  they just come here and live their life . 
  and inform all other eu countries about their identities . 
  they pose a serious threat to public security , so they have no right to be in any eu country besides their home country . 
  it 's time that we start to deal with these `` activists '' in a proper way . 
  but of course they should receive a fair trial first and they should only be expelled if they are convicted .
