  32,000 $ that will be spend on things for the parents is much easier to implement . 
  just have to take more debt . 
  no need to go against employers . 
  do n't you see the difference between monthly payments and a one-time payment ? 
  do you think children only cause on-time expenses ? 
  and do you think most parents will use these 32,000 $ for their children ? 
  it 's much easier to waste a 32,000 $ one-time payment than lower monthly payments . 
  i would have no problem with increasing the kindergeld in hungary . 
  but a one time payment that high is a populistic way to buy some votes . 
  i see the hungarian government follows the former greek way of buying votes with debt . 
  good luck, 
  when someone says `` you ca n't discriminate against eu citizens '' they actually mean `` you ca n't do the things that are forbidden according to eu freedom of movement rules '' . 
  every country discriminates against eu citizen . 
  because none of them allow eu citizens to vote in national elections . 
  but that does not violate eu law . 
  and eu freedom of movement rules do n't require host countries to pay benefits to eu `` tourists '' ( first 90 days of residency when not working ) or eu non-workers . 
  in fact , if you ca n't support yourself and are a non-worker you lose freedom of movement for that country . 
  which is hardly enforced . 
  but if you have n't worked for a substantial amount of time in another eu country you wo n't receive welfare . 
  and if you have been unemployed for a substantial amount of time and do n't actively look for work you wo n't receive welfare either . 
  it 's just that german courts have ruled stricter than eu court . 
  according to german law some non-workers qualify for benefits . 
  so germany wants to change the law so that is no longer possible . 
  obviously within the limit of eu laws . 
  you can discriminate against eu non-workers and eu non-tourists as long as you want . 
  freedom of movement is freedom of movement for workers . 
  the eu was smart enough to not create freedom of movement for benefit leeches . 
  eu freedom of movement is freedom of movement ** for workers ** . 
  people who do n't work are not covered by freedom of movement . 
  they can stay in a country for 90 days for vacation . 
  after these 90 days , only workers and their families ( or people who are able to support themselves without welfare ) are allowed to stay in the eu country that is n't their home country . 
  german courts have ruled that according to german law , even eu citizens who are n't workers qualify for welfare . 
  and now that law will be changed . 
   tell me again how an eu federal army will do that when half dont even agree with one another ? 
  like nato ? 
  because nato consists of several member countries as well ? 
  there is no nato army . 
  there are individual armies that cooperate under the nato flag with a common command structure . 
  and 22 of the 28 nato armies are eu armies . 
  if we had to defend the eu outside of nato we would obviously create these structures . 
  heck , we could probably just use the nato command structure that exists in europe . 
  so we can help the us invade countries like afghanistan . 
  remember the last time a nato country invoked article 5 ? 
  almost like nato is a mutual defence agreement . 
  europe does n't necessarily need the us to defend itself . 
  and the us does n't necessarily need europe to defend itself . 
  but that does n't mean that we should abolish nato . 
  if we are in a mutual defence treaty it 's easier to defend ourselves with the partner from the other side of the atlantic ocean . 
  the rhetoric of the generous us that protects us incapable leeches in europe is getting old really quick . 
  -- and here 's another fun fact about article 5 :  at the drafting of article 5 in the late 1940s , there was consensus on the principle of mutual assistance , but fundamental disagreement on the modalities of implementing this commitment . 
  the european participants wanted to ensure that the united states would automatically come to their assistance should one of the signatories come under attack ; the united states did not want to make such a pledge and obtained that this be reflected in the wording of article 5 . 
   http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm, 
  which nato members refused to participate after article 5 was triggered for the first and only time ? 
  that 's wrong as well . 
  that table is about direct spending on nato . 
  several budgets are covered by these contributions . 
  the civil budget contains the cost of running the nato headquarter . 
  the military budget for providing the integrated command structure . 
  and there 's also the the nato security investment program , which contains investments to the long time security of nato . 
  mundane stuff like increasing the capacity of conference rooms . 
  or the modernization of a lithuanian airfield . 
  that 's all paid from a common budget . 
  individual nato members contribute to that budget by a share that was agreed by nato members . 
  there are also indirect contributions which do n't come from the budget . 
  for example germany pays for the german troops that are currently in afghanistan for the nato mission resolute support . 
  unless article 5 is invoked these contributions are voluntarily . 
  but the military budgets of individual member countries are not part of the nato budget . 
  nato just set the guideline to spend 2 % of the gdp on military . 
  these 893 billion are the total of the military budgets of the 28 nato members . 
  obviously the us contributes most to that . 
  but they do n't contribute all of their budget because of nato . 
  if the us would leave nato they would n't downsize their military to 0 . 
  so it 's hardly justified to say that they only have such a huge military to protect europe . 
  it 's not . 
  because no eu country is willing to spend these additional 2.7 billion dollar on weapons that will be deployed to eastern europe . 
  not even eastern europe . 
  do n't trust things that redditors point out . 
  he quoted the table that shows the percentage each member contributes . 
  the total nato budget is not 100.0000 billion , as outlined in that table . 
  it 's 100 % obviously . 
  and the us , being the biggest economy in the nato contributes 22.1446 % of the budget . 
  germany contributes 14.65 % to the budget . 
  which is actually much more than i would have expected considering that the us gdp is 4.5 times the german gdp . 
  but i 'm no expert in nato budgeting , so i do n't know how the `` direct spending '' share is calculated . 
  europe is lacking behind in spending 2 % of their gdp on the military . 
  but that has nothing to do with nato contributions . 
  there are n't that many designated nato soldiers . 
  if they exist at all they only protect the nato headquarters . 
  every other soldier that fights under the nato banner comes from a member country . 
   from 22.1 b to 25.5 b  [ ... ]  ( see the table under `` direct funding '' ) . 
  you mean the table that is labeled with `` cost ** share ** arrangements '' ? 
  share as in `` percentage '' ? 
  that 's also why all numbers add up to 100.0000, 
  that table shows cost ** share ** arrangements . 
  the percentage each contributor pays to the nato budget . 
  that 's why the sum of all that is 100.0000 . 
  100 percent . 
  not 100.0000 billion . 
  for people like me :  a kangaroo court is a judicial tribunal or assembly that blatantly disregards recognized standards of law or justice , and often carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides . 
  merriam-webster defines it as a `` mock court in which the principles of law and justice are disregarded or perverted '' .
