  ( greece is in eu ), 
  good luck keeping people out of the eu if you do n't even want to force people to stay in slovakia . 
  so let me get this straight . 
  according to you , the situation will fix itself , because after germany , other countries will naturally close their border . 
  so why do n't the other countries close their border first if germany refuses to do so ? 
  what 's stopping slovenia to do what they agreed when they joined schengen ? 
  why can they only close their border after germany and austria have closed their borders ? 
  the federal agency for migration published a forecast of 800,000 asylum seekers till the end of the year , a good week before merkel `` invited everyone '' . 
  or ten-thousands of poles before the collapse of the ussr . 
  be careful , she might lose the case . 
   the czech prime minister , bohuslav sobotka , says a `` alternate border system '' that would run from bulgaria to macedonia should be created if the external borders of the schengen zone are not successfully reinforced . 
  what does this even mean ? 
  cut of greece and leave a hole in that `` alternate border system '' in albania ? 
  and why the fuck should that work better than schengen ? 
  because macedonia is intrinsically more capable of protecting its border than slovenia ? 
  nobody gets arrested for protesting . 
  but you might get arrested for throwing bottles and fireworks at police . 
  but no , there are n't 200 bottle-throwers in investigative custody . 
  the number is 0 . 
  to clarify , that 's the first arrest of a suspect that is accused of sexual assault . 
  currently there are 7 other suspects in investigative custody , they are accused of property crimes only . 
  there are ongoing investigations against 21 suspects . 
  that 's the nice thing about having the atlantic ocean between you and the asylum seekers . 
  you can be picky . 
  the eu ca n't be picky . 
  because the asylum seekers simply appear in our countries . 
  or alimanovic c-67 / 14  the court notes that there are two possibilities for the purposes of granting a right of residence to job-seekers such as those in the present case :    where an eu citizen who has enjoyed a right of residence as a worker is in ** involuntary unemployment after having worked for less than a year ** and has registered as a ** job-seeker ** with the relevant employment office , he ** retains the status of worker and the right of residence for no less than six months . 
  ** during that period , he can rely on the principle of equal treatment and is entitled to social assistance . 
    where an eu citizen ** has not yet worked ** in the host member state or where ** the period of six months has elapsed ** , a job-seeker can not be expelled from that member state for as long as he can provide evidence that he is continuing to seek employment and that he has a genuine chance of being engaged . 
  ** however ** , in this case the ** host member state may refuse to grant any social assistance ** . 
  wonderful plot twist . 
  the increase in sales of pepper spray and other weapons happened because the asylum seekers arm themselves . 
  on the other hand , transport by rail is much faster than going by ship . 
  beijing to hamburg takes 15 days by train and ~ 30 days by ship . 
  the railway connection closes a gap between slow and cheap ship and fast and very expensive airplane . 
   it was a really hateful place from then on . 
  but you could actually have a discussion back then . 
  there were plenty of postings where two comments with opposite opinions right next to each other were both upvoted significantly . 
  you wo n't find that anymore . 
  the average brexit-supporter will answer with a blank stare if you mention things like * single market * , * eea * , * efta * or * customs union * . 
   we import more than we export to europe . 
  if they really want to screw themselves over they can do that sure . 
  let 's assume there wo n't be any trade between the uk and the eu . 
  in 2014 the uk would have lost 295 billion euro . 
  and the eu would have lost 367 billion euro . 
  or 13 % of the uk gdp and 3 % of the eu gdp . 
  who would suffer more ? 
   i do n't see why we ca n't negotiate a new trade deal . 
  and , as pointed out in the article , the question is what kind of deal that would be . 
  so where are the trains ? 
   those laws were created after the fact . 
  murder was illegal in the third reich as well . 
  in fact most of the murder section of the current german law was written in 1941 . 
  we just replaced the death penalty to live long prison sentence later . 
  and there is currently a debate if we should revise the murder paragraph because it uses rather arbitrary criterions like treachery and greed to distinguish murder and manslaughter . 
  `` thwart ''  berlin -- german chancellor angela merkel backed bulgaria on monday in its bid to seek new talks with russia about the south stream natural gas pipeline after moscow shelved the project this month in favor of an alternative link via turkey . 
   http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/germany-backs-revival-of-russia-s-south-stream-gas-pipeline-project/513348.html --  `` we should clarify all of the legal issues related to the south stream project and use them to move forward talks with russia . 
  ... at the moment , the west and russia have signed many contracts . 
  ... representatives of germany 's economy have experience in cooperating with russia as a reliable partner '' . 
   http://nsnbc.me/2014/12/16/is-germanys-merkel-trying-to-resuscitate-the-south-stream-pipeline/ --  the eu should try to eliminate the obstacles to the construction of south stream , the minister of economy of germany sigmar gabriel stated . 
   http://www.rusmininfo.com/news/18-11-2014/germany-calls-remove-hindrance-way-south-stream --  `` regarding the big energy projects -- nabucco and others which could pass through bulgaria in the future , such as south stream , we reached an agreement to maintain normal relations with the russian side and to observe the law and directions by brussels . 
  i am very thankful that chancellor merkel engaged personally , together with jean-claude juncker and the ec 's legal team to act first for a solution to the south stream case '' , bulgarian pm commented following the meeting . 
   http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/germany-to-help-bulgaria-on-south-stream, 
  are there any other sources for this ? 
  reuters ? 
  something reputable ? 
  heck , a link to the alleged source of this news , ukrinform , would satisfy me as well . 
  this sounds like a strange step , considering that a couple days ago ukraine made a deal to buy gas from european suppliers . 
  as a good german i only buy german lemons . 
  did you read the part about the 10,000 datasets of swiss bank accounts that north rhine-westphalia gave to greece ? 
  i doubt that these accounts , combined worth some 4 billion euro , belong to the average greek pensioner . 
  german municipalities set the taxi fees since basically forever . 
  in germany , taxis are part of public transport , which has plenty of rules . 
  congratulations , you succeeded at not being funny . 
  ever heard of airplanes ? 
  awesome technology . 
  germany 's largest airline , lufthansa , moves more than 100 million people per year . 
  none of these prove citizenship . 
  so it 's a mobile-only aliexpress ? 
  i would call it unnecessary instead of hilarious there 's zero chance that he 'll be banned . 
  they debate it because they are legally required to debate petitions that reach a certain amount of signatures . 
  `` above '' offered him 3 platoons ( \u00e0 38 officers ) state police as reinforcements , which he declined . 
  considering that the last police chief who downplayed something was forced to retire by state and federal government , i would side with the police . 
  that 's not second tier though . 
  if we go by eu integration , efta is second tier . 
  they implement all the single market rules brussels dictates . 
  the eu customs union would probably be the third tier . 
  no harsh diktat , but common external tariffs and no solo-runs on treaties with other countries . 
  turkey is part of that tier . 
  the uk wants to be associated on a level below that . 
  because they do n't want brussels to interfere with their ability to form treaties with other countries . 
  so the uk would be fourth-tier or fifth-tier . 
  one of them contains the eu accession candidates . 
  though i 'm not sure who wants higher eu integration , the uk or countries like serbia . 
  judging by their opinion about the european charter of fundamental rights , the uk probably settles for fifth-tier . 
  if there 's one thing that 's for sure , it 's that the uk will continue to blame the eu . 
   but it would harm the eu more would it ? 
  let 's assume there wo n't be any trade between the uk and the eu . 
  in 2014 the uk would have lost 295 billion euro . 
  and the eu would have lost 367 billion euro .
