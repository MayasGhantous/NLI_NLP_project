  no shooting necessary . 
  so 3 % of the men that were convicted for committing rapes in a gang were white . 
  here 's the paragraph that follows the one you picked for your headline . 
   ** considerable caution ** is needed when looking at these numbers , as our sample is very unscientific . 
  there are grooming cases we will have missed , and there will undoubtedly be offences that have not resulted in convictions . 
  and a few paragraphs above the part that you picked :  of 52 groups where ethnicity data was provided , 26 ( 50 per cent ) comprised all asian offenders , ** 11 ( 21 per cent ) were all white ** , 9 ( 17 per cent ) groups had offenders from multiple ethnicities , 4 ( 8 per cent ) were all black offenders and there were 2 ( 4 per cent ) exclusively arab groups . 
    of the 306 offenders whose ethnicity was noted , 75 per cent were categorised as asian , ** 17 per cent white ** , and the remaining 8 per cent black ( 5 per cent ) or arab ( 3 per cent ) . 
  and as far as i understand the article that 's just for gangs that committed sexual violence . 
  how many of the child groomers that were n't part of a gang are white ? 
  without a diplomatic solution with turkey , there is no way to protect sea borders from asylum seekers in a way that is compatible with european values . 
  it 's a pipe dream to think that the crisis can be solved by simply stationing more border guards in the mediterranean sea . 
  unless turkey allows us to send people back , every single person that is caught by these border guards will be brought to the eu anyway . 
  because we wo n't let people drown . 
  would n't be the first time that french authorities raid that camp . 
  that 's what the eu does since basically the beginning of the crisis in syria . 
  our thw even build the infrastructure of one of the camps in jordan . 
  but that has n't stopped people from entering the eu . 
   also , while at it , consider kicking out austria as well . 
  last time i checked austria does n't have external schengen borders . 
  the schengen treaty requires that austria does not protect its borders with other schengen members . 
   well that 's crap , the eu needs to bolster frontex and frontex needs the specific mission of guarding the outer eu borders ( read : greek coastline and waters , same for italian , french and spanish waters ) . 
  that would just be a ferry service with officers who have guns . 
  the truth is that in europe 's situation , sea borders ca n't be protected without letting people drown . 
  turkey does n't want to take people back , and greece ( or frontex for that matter ) ca n't invade turkey to bring people back to turkish shores . 
  and international law and common sense require that you help people who are in distress at the seas . 
  no matter how many frontex agents you station in the mediterranean sea , if every single person that gets caught is brought to greece nothing will change . 
  the refugee crisis needs a political solution that involves turkey and the unhcr . 
  everything else is just positive thinking . 
  yes . 
  now . 
  but hungary has let in at least 201,495 people . 
  that 's the number of people who requested asylum in hungary in the 12 months before october 2015 . 
  and basically everyone of them has already left hungary for another schengen country . 
  according to the [ eurostat asylum quarterly report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_quarterly_report ) 201,495 people have requested asylum in hungary in the 12 months before october 2015 . http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/7/7a/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_q3_2014_\u2013_q3_2015.png, 
  maybe she does n't think that she was wrong . 
  you misunderstood that . 
  currently there are laws that only allow businesses to employ asylum seekers ( with undecided or denied applications ) if they can prove that there is no eu citizen who can do the job . 
  if that law is abolished , it does not mean that a business has to employ asylum seekers before they can employ eu citizens . 
  it would just mean that germans , eu-citizens and asylum seekers are equivalent . 
  once an asylum seeker has received refugee status they are already equivalent for employment purposes . 
  anyway it 's highly unlikely that this law will be abolished . 
  because it would incentivize even more economic migration . 
  the asylum seekers are not in germany to plug any gap . 
  they are here for humanitarian reasons only . 
  neither to replace the aging population nor to provide a cheap workforce . 
  any positive effect of asylum seekers is `` if life gives you lemons make lemonade '' . 
  we have plenty other migration that we want . 
  eu migration for example . 
  because it 's much cheaper , and the social tensions that are caused by it are less severe . 
  even if you remove every single asylum seeker from the statistics , germany has the highest net migration in the eu . 
  in 2015 we might have reached a net migration of +400,000 eu-citizens alone ( 2014 : +340,000 , 2013 : +300,000 ) . 
  in that case we should kick out slovenia and hungary first . 
  asylum seekers do n't board planes in greece . 
  they leave the schengen area , just to enter it again further north . 
  asylum seekers that enter the schengen area in greece are primarily a problem for greece . 
  ever heard of eurodac , the eu wide database for asylum seekers ? 
  it 's the very right word . 
  we have separation of powers , it 's not up to merkel , or anyone from the executive branch , to decide who gets deported . 
  we have judges for these decisions . 
  how much money do you need so you leave germany ? 
  if you get an opt-out so you do n't have to participate in certain policy areas , why should you get a voice in that very same area ? 
  only brits can demand more say in matters concerning the euro while at the same time demanding that the eu has less say in matters that concern the uk . 
   so they 're not that alone . 
  i doubt that portheault was talking about pseudonymous postings on the internet . 
  unfortunately we do n't have a papua new guinea . 
  you mean `` on an island '' . 
   austria and germany both have laws that allow deporting non-integrating refugees ( like ones living on welfare , criminals etc. ), 
  so its just a matter of executing these laws . 
  these laws are n't worth the paper they are written on . 
  we do n't even manage to deport half of the people that are n't refugees according to the un definition . 
  heck , i live next to a family of asylum seekers from kosovo who are here since more than a year . 
  from kosovo !, 
  a country that will most likely be part of the eu within the next 10 years . 
  we ca n't even deport people back there . 
  and you think that laws that allow us to deport `` non-integrating refugees '' are useful ? 
  did you know that since 1993 we have a law that says that people who enter germany via another eu country do n't have the right to asylum ? 
  since then we have probably handed out more than a million positive asylum decisions to people who entered germany via another eu country . 
   i will make the assumption , that most refugees are really fleeing from war and are not trying to migrate for economical reasons . 
  according to [ bamf numbers published yesterday ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/meldungen/de/2016/201610106-asylgeschaeftsstatistik-dezember.html ) , of the 282,726 asylum decisions that were made in 2015 , 137,136 ended in refugee status . 
  additionally 1,707 people received subsidiary protection . 
  so 49 % of the people that requested asylum in germany are actually persecuted or threatened in their home country . 
  the second largest group of people who requested asylum in 2015 are still albanians . 
  followed by kosovars . 
  and even people who are fleeing from persecution have economic motifs if they go to germany . 
  greece is a safe country . 
  hungary and croatia are safe countries . 
  and of course austria and slovenia are safe countries too . 
   i think we have a moral obligation to help and there are are two main reasons for that :  2 \\ . 
  the humanitarian situation of these refugees . 
  they basically gave up everything they had to escape the horror of war and we should show solidarity with other human beings . 
  they bought a very expensive entry ticket to the life they want . 
  there are millions of people who do n't have the money to buy that ticket to germany . 
  where is the solidarity with them ? 
  you want to show solidarity ? 
  send everyone who came on his own back to a refugee camp . 
  and resettle persons who are actually in need for resettlement . 
  people with illnesses , people who are victims of torture or war crimes , children and young women who travel alone . 
  like germany did in 2013 . 
  resettle the full fucking obergrenze of 200,000 each year and you help more people than today . 
  currently we only help people who can afford to pay the smugglers .
