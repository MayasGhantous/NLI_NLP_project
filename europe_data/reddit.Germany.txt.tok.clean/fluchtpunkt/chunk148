  dublin request the shit out of italy , hungary and croatia ? 
  did he declare that the play is * entartete kunst * ? 
  they did n't let people through in early 2015 because merkel would `` invite '' asylum seekers in august 2015 . 
  maybe you have the timeline wrong . 
  q2/2015 ended in june 2015 . 
  hungary started to build their fence in june 2015 as well . 
  and in the same month hungary [ announced ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/23/uk-europe-migrants-austria-hungary-idukkbn0p31zb20150623 ) that they would suspend the dublin regulations . 
  that means they would not take migrants back that left hungary for another country . 
  merkel `` invited '' people in late august . 
  in august she also said that germany will not request dublin relocations for syrians . 
  and hungary completed the fence in september . 
  hungary 's strategy was not to `` not allow them into hungary in the first place '' . 
  their strategy was to let them continue to other parts of the eu . 
  and then they realized that this strategy could backfire because countries like austria , germany , sweden could request dublin relocations if they get too many people . 
  which would mean hungary actually has to host and process the 100,000 asylum seekers they let through . 
  that 's why they build a fence and announced that they wo n't take anyone back . 
   from the perspective of the other eu nations , we recognised that there was a problem and we needed to do something about it . 
  letting everyone continue to austria , germany and sweden ? 
  around 100,000 people ( [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/2c/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_q2_2014_\u2013_q2_2015.png ) ) requested asylum in hungary in the 12 months before the end of q2/2015 . 
  merkel `` invited '' everyone in late august 2015 . 
  almost like there was a problem before merkel `` opened the border '' . 
  it might sound strange , but germany has no control over borders that are n't german borders . 
  somebody else let all these people in . 
  and germany never suspended the dublin regulations . 
  the mandatory part of the dublin regulations say that a country is responsible for the asylum application of an asylum seeker who entered the eu in that country . 
  if an asylum seeker appears in a country that was not the first country they set foot in , the dublin regulations allow that country to file a relocation request with the first country . 
  the dublin regulations also offers the option to voluntarily take responsibility for an asylum case . 
  and that 's what germany did . 
  they said `` we wo n't request dublin relocations for syrians '' . 
  yeah . 
  if we would n't give a fuck about human rights everything would be awesome . 
  unfortunately human rights are part of the european values . 
  italy was fined because they send asylum seekers back to libya where they faced the risk of torture and persecution . 
  which is a violation of article 3 of the european convention on human rights . 
  `` no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . '', 
  did we send the army or how can we dictate such things to other eu nations ? 
  or are you referring to the eu quota system which received overwhelming support ( 432 yay , 142 nay , 57 abstentions ) in the eu parliament ? 
   no problem with mentioning poles , though . 
   apparently only nazi germans were killing jews , but all poles did . 
  poles were mentioned two times in the article . 
  and both times were about present day poles . 
  does the us do pre-clearance in russia ? 
  do n't forget hungary . 
  100,000 people requested asylum in the 12 months before the end of q2/15 ( [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/2c/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_q2_2014_\u2013_q2_2015.png ) ) . 
  and yet they are one of the biggest opponents of a eu refugee quota system . 
  because their strategy was to send everyone to austria . 
  then they announce that they no longer take dublin relocations ( that 's the mandatory part of the law , germany ignored the optional part ) . 
  the refugee crisis did not start in late august when merkel `` invited '' everyone . 
  weeks before her `` invitation '' , the federal agency for migration and refugees already estimated 800,000 asylum seekers for 2015 . 
  and many , including me , did not believe these numbers , because at this point we had just gotten 200,000 asylum requests . 
  and according to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/2c/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_q2_2014_\u2013_q2_2015.png ) 746725 people requested asylum in the eu in the 12 months before the end of q2/2015 . 
  q2 ended way before august . 
  there 's as much difference as there is between `` innocent until proven guilty '' and `` guilty until proven innocent '' . 
   either write `` nazis and anti-semitists '' or `` germans and poles '' . 
  would be a bit stupid , because the two times poles were mentioned in the article would read like this :  more than 40,000 jews were killed here but for decades that horror was erased from history , buried by repression and forcibly forgotten by a generation of postwar ~ ~ poles ~ ~ anti-semites desperate to ignore what they had witnessed . 
   [ ... ]  institutes such as grodzka gate and the recently opened polin museum of the history of the polish jews in warsaw have alerted huge numbers of ~ ~ poles ~ ~ anti-semites to the contribution that jews made to poland 's rich history . 
  and suddenly the article is implying that todays poles are anti-semites . 
  which is probably not what you intended . 
  ireland is not part of schengen . 
  when people on here say multicultural , they usually mean multireligional . 
  there are good migrants from different cultures like greeks , and bad migrants from different cultures like turks . 
   i wonder if there are any other place that would love to have a vote on their sovereignty the donbass region ? 
  we do n't need no constitution . 
  we do n't need no separation of powers . 
  the majority party can do as they please . 
  if you buy 12 bottles maybe . 
   considering that montenegro has no military then probably . 
  they actually have an army . 
  they are even part of the resolute support mission in afghanistan . 
   i mean luxembourg has no military but thats in nato so de ja vu they have an army as well . 
  iceland is the only nato country without a standing army . 
   anti-govt protests not a nato problem . 
  it 's sad how the uk handles the poorest of the richest 1 percent . 
  they should at least subsidize mortgage payments for their 1 million euro family-home . 
  nobody can expect a london family to survive on an monthly income of just 22,000 $ . 
  a family with two daughters nonetheless . 
  what 's the reason for your expectation ? 
  rule number three if you create visible alphanumeric identifiers : check against a dictionary in at least english and your local language and discard every identifier that contains a substantial word . 
  when was the last time you have protested against terrorism ? 
  it 's safe to assume that you never did . 
  because if you are not muslim nobody assumes that you support terrorism if you do n't publicly protest against terrorism . 
  so what do you suggest ? 
  should they sneak around in the neighborhood looking for clues ? 
  should they become private investigators and do the job of the police and the intelligence community ? 
  the conclusion after the last few terror attacks on eu soil is that the perpetrators are known to police and the intelligence community . 
  most of them are being `` watched '' already . 
  yet authorities are not able prevent these attacks . 
  and suddenly non-extremist muslims have an obligation to stop terrorism because of their responsibility to the greater society . 
  time for two-speed commonwealth . 
  commonwealth-brexit referendum imminent !, 
  are you a nato general or something ? 
  we still have . 
  after usa and georgia . 
  and because the parliament recently decided to increase the number of soldiers we 'll have the second largest contingent soon . 
  is that your opinion as a soldier who participated in kfor/isaf/resolute support ? 
  ask in kosovo or afghanistan . 
  the countries with an outer border were responsible for controlling the outer border . 
  because these countries want to keep sovereignty over such a substantial thing like border control . 
  and these countries were incentivized to actually control their border by rules like the dublin regulations . 
  for comparison : in a similar poll ( tns forschung 2001/51 ) in 2001 , 68 % of germans were for a german contribution to a un mission in afghanistan .
