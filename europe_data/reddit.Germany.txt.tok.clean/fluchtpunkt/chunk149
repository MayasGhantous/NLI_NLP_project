  not even the us coast guard sinks boats full of illegal migrants . 
  on small levels like a unified army . 
  lol that just needs a unified foreign policy . 
  and the will of a soldier from lithuania to fight in south america for some french territory . 
  it 's a great plan . 
  if we relinquish our freedom voluntarily , terrorist ca n't take it away . 
  that 's why 2015 has a little asterisk attached . 
  and the foot note `` stand : 17.11.2015 '' translates to `` as of 17 . 
  november 2015 '' . 
   simple as this, 
   persons at-risk-of-poverty are those living in a household with an equivalised disposable income below the risk-of-poverty threshold , which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income ( after social transfers ) . 
  the equivalised income is calculated by dividing the total household income by its size determined after applying the following weights : 1.0 to the first adult , 0.5 to each other household members aged 14 or over and 0.3 to each household member aged less than 14 years old . 
  [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion#context ), 
  3 ) the love for dank memes . 
  the `` sternly worded letter '' meme is among the most upvoted in news related subs . 
  the solution are guarded refugee camps , where each refugee waits until their background check and asylum process is completed . 
  after that it 's either jail , deportation or relocation to another eu country . 
  it 's nothing that will happen though . 
  we just build higher fences and hope that they will go somewhere else . 
  yeah . 
  without such a system it 's nearly impossible to find a bus or s-bahn in berlin . 
  as eu citizen you can travel , live and work in every single eu country . 
  and liechtenstein , iceland , norway and switzerland . 
  no matter in what other organization these countries are in addition to that . 
  schengen is a subdivision of the eu ( to be more correct : eea/switzerland area ) . 
  you are allowed to travel and move to all eea ( eu + liechtenstein , iceland , norway ) countries and switzerland . 
  so of course you are allowed to enter and travel in the schengen area . 
  your eu citizenship allows you to travel ( and move to ) every single eu/efta country . 
  which of course includes the schengen zone . 
  -- as eu citizen there are even more countries you can visit without a visa . 
  wikipedia has an article about it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_european_union_citizens make sure to check on the website of the country you intend to visit before traveling . 
  but there 's no reason to check for eu countries and switzerland , norway , iceland , liechtenstein . 
  that 's a different proposal . 
  the proposal by jeff flake and dianne feinstein wants to ** end ** the visa waiver program for people who travelled to iraq or syria . 
  rand paul 's proposal wants to institute a 30-day waiting period for citizens of visa waiver countries . 
  --  additionally , the legislation would impose a 30-day waiting period for all entries to the u.s. in order for background checks to be completed , unless the traveler has been approved through the global entry program . 
  if a person does not have a valid schengen visa , or another permit that allows them free travel in the schengen area , he is not allowed to travel in the schengen area . 
  if persons without schengen permits are detected is a different question . 
  schengen removed systematic border checks , but random checks still do happen . 
  so there 's always a risk that border police waits at the end of the flight to check for illegal migrants . 
  albania entered visa liberalisation with the schengen zone in december 2010 . 
  which means albanian citizens with a biometric passport can enter the schengen zone for 90 days ( within 6 months ) , and travel freely in it during that time . 
  but the 30 day waiting period , as suggested by rand paul , will affect a sizable portion of people . 
  last time i checked sweden does not control external eu borders that are used by a noteworthy amount of refugees . 
  i think someone else is letting refugees enter the eu . 
  even without refugees , `` your own '' wo n't receive more support . 
  that 's the common gist of `` we should do x first before we do y '' arguments . 
   there is a perfectly good alternative to the european union -- it is called the european free trade association , founded in 1960 . 
  switzerland , norway , iceland and liechtenstein are members . 
  stands for friendship and cooperation through free trade . 
  it does not rob anyone of sovereignty , it does n't aim for the political unification of its member states , but members do have access to the internal european market . 
  wait until you realize that countries who want access to the eu internal market have to implement laws that were made in brussels . 
  all efta countries have freedom of movement for eea/switzerland citizens . 
  good luck with setting your migration policy by joining efta . 
   we need a system like switzerland 's , in which people have the opportunity to hold regular binding referendums whenever they feel that elected representatives are acting against the people 's will . 
  it 's no coincidence that the swiss never sold out their interests to brussels . 
  so when does switzerland limit eu migration ? 
  i have yet to see someone who questions freedom of movement for eea/switzerland workers because of the terror attacks . 
  you are still hated because you try to regulate migration of good economic migrants , namely eu citizens . 
  oh so peaceful balkans during the early nineties !, 
   but they can provoke a civil war which parts of europe eventually ** will look like the balkans in the early nineties ** . 
  learn to read . 
  because the title says * refugees * instead of `` economic migrants who are actually soldiers who want to destroy europe '', 
  it 's not the job of frontex to protect eu borders . 
  just look at their full name and you 'll see what their job is : `` european agency for the ** management of operational cooperation ** at the external borders of the member states of the european union '', 
  because an iron curtain on the southern external eu border would be kind of hard to build . 
  considering that there is an ocean . 
  that 's why she suggests a cordon sanitaire there , a buffer zone if you will . 
  a buffer zone that is large enough so we should be able to arrest and intern anyone who tries to cross it . 
   all this comes down to a ` fortress europe ' , with ** a new iron curtain in the east ** and ** a cordon sanitaire in the mediterranean and the adriatic ** ? 
  yes . 
  who says that the iron curtain would be in the middle of the eu ? 
  in this context iron curtain probably means `` nearly impenetrable border '' , not `` in the middle of europe '' . 
  the german laws prohibit public statements and the production , import , supply and distribution of propaganda material . 
  not more . 
  if you deny the holocaust and call for the death of all jews while wearing a ss uniform at your private birthday party you wo n't be charged . 
   iirc in germany you can be arrested for possessing nazi paraphernalia . 
  if by possession you mean showing it in a public setting without historic context , yes . 
  so two-speed europe will still be without the brits ? 
  even efta with brussels diktat , customs union , free movement and the non-discrimantory clauses for eu/efta citizens will be too much for many brexit advocates . 
  they want to set their own immigration policy , negotiate their own trade agreements and not be ruled by brussels . 
  this will neither be possible in efta nor in eu light . 
  uk ( and probably norway ) want 50 ( +6 ) speed europe . 
  every country can adopt the eu things that profit them , and ignore the things that cost them . 
  no problem , just have to establish a permanent state of emergency , remove civil rights and leave schengen and everything will be fine . 
  we already have two-speed europe . 
  eu and efta . 
  move eastern europe to asia , so they all post in \\ / r/asia instead of \\ / r/europe . 
  because they have turnovers of less than 36,400 $ ? 
  too bad europe is not a police state . 
  it would be so safe and comfy . 
  it is in the legal framework that the states have to work in . 
  because 1 . 
  saxony will not host millions of refugees 2 . 
  the federal government compensate the states for every refugee that 's why it 's a populist proposal . 
  there is no realistic way to implement it . 
  but now the afd can put on their website that they wanted to pay every newborn 5000 $ . 
   they have n't done anything yet as they have not been in power , for more than a year they have 14 seats in the state parliament of saxony . 
  but you are correct , they have n't done anything substantial . 
  well they have proposed things like that every new born child receives 5000 $ .
