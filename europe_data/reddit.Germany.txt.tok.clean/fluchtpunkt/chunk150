  which would cost the state of saxony 180 million euro per year . 
  they have yet to announce where that money should come from . 
  they are a typical populist fringe party . 
  they propose things that sound great , but they have no plan how to implement that . 
  that 's why they simply tell the landtag what they should do . 
  i think they have yet to propose an actual law change . 
  it will be totally boring and not interesting at all . 
  greetings from a state that has 9.7 % afd in the parliament since more than a year . 
  they are a populist fringe party and they will stay a populist fringe party . 
  their proposals ( e.g. 
  pay every new born baby 5000 $ ) usually cost 100 million euro and more . 
  or they just state common sense like `` the police should be friendly to citizens '' . 
  it 's pretty obvious that none of them have political experience . 
  and their proposals are actually just requests for others to do something . 
  they have yet to propose an actual law change ( with all the complicated legal speak ) . 
  but at least they do n't smuggle weapons into the landtag . 
  so they are a bit better than npd . 
  and i 'm sure that every country west of the iron curtain can not monitor every muslim . 
  still unconfirmed . 
  it 's a very effective way to show people that the daesh cutthroats ca n't be stopped by infidels . 
  to inflict the maximum amount of fear you want to commit your terror acts in places where people feel safe . 
  even without schengen there would n't be guarded fences between eu countries . 
  well . 
  it 's time to change that law . 
  mutual defense clauses that are n't really mutual are not the best idea . 
  so i guess it 's now germanys fault that it does n't protect the borders of other countries . 
  the only thing the eu should do is to coordinate our efforts in syria so we do n't accidentally kill each other . 
   while the german military is notoriously hard to use ( parliamentary clause ) for a military that is notoriously hard to use , we are present in many foreign countries . 
  - kfor in kosovo ( largest contingent ) - operation active endeavour in the mediterranean sea to fight piracy - air policing baltic - unifil ii -- united nations interim force in lebanon - unamid -- united nations and african union mission in darfur - eu navfor somalia -- operation atalanta - eutm somalia - air policing iceland - unmiss -- united nations mission in the republic of south sudan - eucap nestor -- regional maritime capacity building mission in the horn of africa and the western indian ocean - active fence , patriot systems and awacs to protect turkey from syria . 
  though i 'm not sure if troops are still deployed . 
  - op\u00e9ration serval and minusma ( united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali ) - eutm mali - minurso ( united nations mission for the referendum in western sahara ) - ~ ~ eufor rca ( european forces republic of central africa ) ~ ~ ( ended march 2015 ) - resolute support -- afghanistan ( largest contingent after usa and georgia , may 2015 ) - training for peshmerga in the autonomous region kurdistan, 
  only a good guy with a database of every communication anyone has made can stop a bad guy with a gun . 
  worse than hitler . 
  we need more authorit\u00e4\u00e4 . 
  and all these democrats with their decisions that i do n't like can fuck off too . 
  i 'm getting tired of this . 
  but okay , let 's do it again . 
  merkel `` invited '' everyone in the last week of august 2015 . 
  a few weeks before that `` invitation '' , the german federal agency for migration and asylum already estimated that 800,000 people will request asylum in 2015 . 
  at this point we only had like 200,000 asylum seekers . 
  which means they estimated that the influx will increase tremendously . 
  many , including me could not believe these numbers . 
  little known fact , but in the 12 months between q2/2014 and end of q2/2015 more than 100,000 people requested asylum in hungary . 
  the refugee crisis did n't start in late august . 
  not at all . 
  there 's a third option . 
  we like some privacy and do n't store biometric of every single citizen in a suspect database . 
  and even if you give them , they wo n't end up in a database . 
  they are stored in the passport/id-card so authorities can later verify that it 's your document . 
  normally , fingerprints that are taken for biometric passports do n't end up in a database . 
  they are stored in the passport so authorities can verify that it 's your passport . 
  and if your country values privacy , they were deleted after they were stored in your biometric passport . 
  pretty weak trump card considering that there are only very few things that germany could sanction unilaterally . 
  if you do n't want shit like this to happen , why did you agree on the proposal ? 
  because everyone hates democracy when the majority decisions are n't their own . 
   how can someone basically force countries to take in refugees . 
  democracy . 
  it works like this : 1 . someone proposes something 2 . the others vote 3 . if there is a majority the proposal comes into effect germany is n't forcing anything on anyone . 
  germany , among other countries proposed a refugee relocation plan . 
  the eu assemblies voted on that plan , and all countries , except hungary , czech republic , slovakia , romania agreed to the plan . 
  it 'll go like this : do we have enough evidence to throw him into jail ? 
  but he 's a terrorist , and that accusation does n't need evidence , so let 's revoke his citizenship and deport him . 
  so let 's assume france removes the only nationality of someone . 
  what do you do with them ? 
  deport them to a random country ? 
  let them live in france because they no longer have a passport which means they are not allowed to enter any other country ? 
  the question should be : should the coalition of the willing compensate france for iraq war that created the power vacuum that brought up isis ? 
  and if you want to add the refugee crisis , the question should be if germany , sweden , austria and greece should be compensated as well . 
  here 's a list of countries that were part of the multi-national force -- iraq ( bold : present during the invasion ) : ** usa ** , ** uk ** , ** australia ** , romania , el salvador , estonia , bulgaria , moldova , albania , ukraine , denmark , czech republic , south korea , tonga , azerbaijan , singapore , bosnia and herzegovina , macedonia , latvia , ** poland ** , kazakhstan , armenia , mongolia , georgia , slovakia , lithuania , italy , norway , japan , hungary , netherlands , portugal , new zealand , thailand , philippines , honduras , dominican republic , spain , nicaragua , iceland . 
  and the answer is no . 
  the past is the past , it 's important to learn from our mistakes in the past and do n't do them again . 
  blaming others wo n't solve any crisis . 
  so it 's like article 5 then ? 
  because article 5 does not require countries to go to war . 
  is would claim to be responsible for my burned pizza if it would help them to reach their goals . 
  so maybe i should go back to school , because i interpreted it the wrong way . 
  would greece give away sovereignty over their own borders to the euro-reich ? 
  \\ #thisisacoup frontex could be a lot of things if the individual countries would give them these rights . 
  but they do n't want to . 
  and why should they . 
  there are no consequences if a country is unable to protect its borders . 
  just let them all through to austria , germany and sweden . 
   just bring a passport or id card . 
  and time . 
  an hour at least , depending on time and border checkpoint much more . 
  which is a problem for many people , because cross-border commutes are actually a thing . 
  and it will be a problem for businesses as well , because a truck that crosses a protected border spends hours waiting in line . 
  guess why romania wants to enter schengen . 
  so that they do n't have to show their passport when they go on vacation once a year ? 
  where do you live ? 
  the uk ? 
  of course in that case a border check is just a minor inconvenience . 
  a friend of mine works in germany while living in poland . 
  how much time will that minor inconvenience add to his daily commute ? 
  how much money will be lost because the truck that takes car parts from the german supplier to bratislava has to wait on two border checkpoints ? 
  the point is probably that countries should do something to stop these private entities from financing the daesh cutthroats . 
  clickbaity headline makes it sound like governments are funding is , but :  `` i provided examples based on our data on the financing of different islamic state ( is , formerly isis/isil ) units by private individuals . 
  this money , as we have established , comes from 40 countries and , there are some of the g20 members among them , '', 
  everyone that makes it into a country that signed the un refugee convention can request asylum . 
  here 's a handy [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/refugeeconvention.png ) so you can see them .
