  every country that is n't gray is such a country . 
   what exactly does he propose we do when police or the army encounter a terrorist with - for example a suicide vest on ? 
  use the current legal framework that allows to kill people who are an immediate threat to yourself or others . 
  read the article again . 
  ** the uk does not have a shoot-to-kill policy . 
  ** do you feel unsafe in the uk ? 
  having a shoot-to-kill policy means that the officers on site are not allowed to use their own judgement if they are faced with a terrorist suspect . 
  they are not allowed to attempt an arrest , they have to shoot to kill no matter the circumstances . 
   the uk 's police forces do not have a blanket `` shoot-to-kill '' policy - but at the same time , police can be legally justified in shooting even if the attacker ends up dead . 
   it all comes down to the law on self-defence . 
  the only person who is legally responsible for pulling the trigger is the police officer holding the gun . 
   that officer must be able to justify under the law that their action amounted to reasonable force to protect themselves or others . 
   that means no chief constable , let alone a minister , would be ever able to tell an armed officer how to respond to the specific scene before them . 
   so if the officer could show the only way to stop a bomber was to shoot them in the head , then he or she would be legally entitled to do so . 
    asked about the prime minister 's own opinion of the shoot-to-kill policy , david cameron 's official spokesman said such matters were ultimately `` an operational decision for police on the ground '' . 
   he said there was a `` clear legal framework '' and that the police `` have extensive training '' . 
  since northern ireland is part of the uk we can assume that it 's exactly about this kind of policy . 
  corby is not happy to have a policy that says `` terrorist suspects have to be killed , no matter the circumstances '' . 
  a shoot-to-kill policy means that every single terrorist has to be shot . 
  even if he is naked and has his arms in the air . 
  the uk currently has no shoot-to-kill policy . 
  and according to the bbc article cameron is okay with that . 
  you do n't need a shoot-to-kill policy to kill suicide bombers . 
  they are an immediate threat and can be killed under the current legal framework . 
  and he 's right . 
  shooting suspects because of a shoot-to-kill policy is pretty stupid . 
  each case needs an individual decision that has to be made by the people on site . 
  if a terrorist suspect is no longer an immediate threat , they should be arrested and not shot . 
  dead people ca n't provide you with information that can help to destroy terror networks . 
  and as it turns out , that 's what is currently the case in the uk . 
  there is no shoot-to-kill policy , and it looks like cameron is okay with that . 
  neither nato 's article 5 nor the eu defense clause require a country to fight a war anyway . 
  you forgot the broomsticks meme . 
  for your information , germany was involved in the war in afghanistan from the get-go . 
  germany was among the biggest suppliers of troops , and we lost 57 soldiers . 
  and currently we have the third largest contingent , after usa and uk in afghanistan . 
  [ 2 october 2001 ] ( http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2001/1001/e1002a.htm ), 
  i wonder if that law change will have a name as cool as '' ** u ** niting and ** s ** trengthening ** a ** merica by ** p ** roviding ** a ** ppropriate ** t ** ools ** r ** equired to ** i ** ntercept and ** o ** bstruct ** t ** errorism act of 2001 '' that 's basically all we have to wonder about , we already know what it will do to civil rights in france . 
  of course nato and eu members both follow the un charter . 
  since many eu members are nato members i would assume the eu article is highly influenced by nato 's article 5 . 
  nato 's articles do n't seem unreasonable so there 's no need for the eu to have a completely different collective defense clause . 
   i imagine he wants to meet with obama and co. before invoking the nato article though . 
  in that case both articles are similar as well . 
  before invoking the defense clause members have to consult with other members . 
  nato has a council , that can and will meet on short notice . 
  and the eu has a council for coordination as well . 
  -- here 's article 51 of the un charter for reference :  nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations , until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security . 
  measures taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the security council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the security council under the present charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security . 
  they are very similar . 
  nato 's article 5 does not require a party to go to war either . 
   article 5   the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that , if such an armed attack occurs , each of them , in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations , will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , ** such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force ** , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . 
    any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the security council . 
  such measures shall be terminated when the security council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security . 
  -- fun fact : [ according to nato ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm ? 
  ) , it was the us that wanted to avoid an obligation to go to war for their allies . 
  can you point out the differences ? 
  it will be the same as last time article 5 was invoked . 
  it 's a fundamental goal for the countries which are currently in the euro and do n't intend to leave . 
  which means a treaty change will be vetoed by them . 
  sweden would not leave the eu if the eu would force them to adopt the euro . 
  there would be another referendum `` yes eu and euro '' and `` no eu and no euro '' , which would end in a yes eu majority . 
  the eu accepts sweden 's decision , because it ca n't do anything that does n't require a treaty change , which would be vetoed by at least sweden and the other members that do n't fulfill the requirements yet . 
   let 's be honest here , if debt haircut was massively unpopular in germany , how can annual donations of billions of euros go through ? 
  because the transfer union will come together with a fiscal union . 
  many eu citizens do n't want that greece is rewarded for their tax and expenditure policies by getting an out of debt card . 
  in a fiscal union greece can not set tax and expenditure policies on their own . 
  so that 's something completely different . 
  most germans already live in a transfer union , but it 's one with common fiscal and expenditure policies . 
   yes but it seems like it is down to an oversight when they were drawing up the treaties . 
  a single currency is one of the fundamental goals of the eu . 
  you wo n't reach that goal if you allow countries to leave the single currency . 
  -- here is article b of the common provisions of the [ maastricht treaty ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:11992m/txt ) :  article b   the union shall set itself the following objectives :   - to promote economic and social progress which is balanced and sustainable , in particular through the creation of an area without internal frontiers , through the strengthening of economic and social cohesion and through the establishment of economic and monetary union , ** ultimately including a single currency ** in accordance with the provisions of this treaty ;, 
  the euro is mandatory for every single eu country , except denmark and the uk because these two negotiated opt-outs . 
  every other eu country has to join when it fulfills the criteria . 
  as a consequence you have to leave the eu to leave the euro . 
   returning from a war-zone should be a one way ticket to jail . 
  is that true for all war-zones , or only muslim ones ? 
  should people who return from ukraine spend the rest of their life in jail ? 
  that will be a quick debate . 
  - do we want to leave the eu ? 
  - so we wo n't leave the euro zone . 
  there are plenty of guns for sale in ex-yugoslavia and eastern europe . 
  no need to smuggle them from countries that are suspects for helping terrorism for decades . 
   let me tell you the european people will not take the right wing extremists lightly . 
  they will , if they keep the muslims out . 
  and they will regret their choice after the muslims are gone . 
   extreme nationalists would n't have a reason to carry out attacks if it were n't for islam 's presence in europe . 
  yep . 
  and if we would have managed to kill all the jews by 1920 , hitler would n't have started the holocaust . 
  the only thing to learn from that is to not pull out too quickly , is n't it ? 
  there were huge protests before and during the early months of kfor and isaf as well . 
   the thing that always crosses my mind when keeping a moment of silence is ` what should i be thinking about ? ' . 
  the same what literally everyone thinks . 
  `` is the minute already over ? 
  it would be very awkward if i would be the one that breaks the silence . 
  i hope somebody else says or does something first '' . 
  calm down , it was just a terror attack that so far killed 139 people . 
  it 's not like reddit fired victoria taylor again , which would justify to take the whole sub [ private for a day ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c0m0a/why_reurope_went_private/ ? ) .
