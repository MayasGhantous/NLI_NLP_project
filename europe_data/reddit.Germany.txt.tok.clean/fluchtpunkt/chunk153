  goebbels disagrees . 
  roughly :  when our opponents say `` yes , we have granted you freedom of expressions '' , yes , you did for us !, 
  but that 's not an argument for us to do the same . 
  that you allowed it is proof of how stupid you are !, 
  can you cite her ? 
  in that case we should kick out eastern europe as fast as possible . 
  do n't want to risk that in case of war half of ukraine/belarus would be swarming to romania/hungary/slovakia / poland/lithuania/latvia / estonia for that sweet sweet eu residency . 
  if poland got into the eu , then the eu would have land borders with russia . 
  because muslims . 
   why now ? 
  now ? 
   the agreement creating an association between the republic of turkey and the european economic community ( commonly known as the ankara agreement ) , made in ** 1963 ** , is an agreement aiming towards the accession of turkey into the european economic community ( eec ) . 
  so 100 % remain ( ex undecided , ex leave ) ? 
  `` monte-who ? 
  that 's some place in south america , is n't it . '', 
  that 's probably how it went . 
  supergau = disaster beyond all expectations, 
  but poland can guarantee the human rights of that one human by not deporting them to a country that will very likely violate their human rights . 
   but far-left activists screaming for the abolition of borders and nations are praised as visionaries . 
  by whom ? 
  by the police force ? 
  or by the public persecutor ? 
  the german government ? 
  merkel even ? 
  can you cite someone ? 
   germany created this problem for themselves by unilaterally inviting waves of immigrants into their country , encouraging them with reassurance they would all be accommodated and treated as asylum seekers rather than economic migrants . 
  yes . 
  the asylum crisis literally started in the last week of august 2015 , after merkel invited everyone . 
  lets just ignore that weeks before her invitation the federal agency for migration and refugees already estimated that 800,000 people will enter germany in 2015 . 
  let 's just ignore that between april 2014 and june 2015 more than 100,000 people requested asylum in hungary . 
  it 's all germanys fault . 
  we started the crisis in late august 2015 . 
  and we failed to protect the outer borders of the eu . 
  that pretty much shows that it 's a stupid meme . 
  because liking someone less and less is not how you react if someone destroys europe . 
  you mentioned sanctions . 
  sanctions that include the gas trade were never on the table , because almost every single eu country relies on russian gas . 
  and south stream was not stopped because germany intervened , the ep is not germany . 
  we do n't have the absolute majority in the european parliament . 
   on 17 april 2014 , amid the 2014 pro-russian conflict in ukraine , the european parliament adopted a non-binding resolution opposing the south stream gas pipeline and recommending a search for alternative sources of gas supplies for the european union . 
  [ 41 ] on 29 april 2014 a memorandum on the implementation of the austrian section was signed in moscow . 
  commissioning of the austrian section is scheduled by january 2018 . 
  [ 42 ] in june 2014 , bulgaria temporarily stopped construction due to the european commission 's infringement procedure against bulgaria for non-compliance with european rules on energy competition public procurements . 
  [ 43 ]   in april 2014 russia filed a complaint at the world trade organization against the european union 's energy market laws that were enacted in 2009 , claiming that they violate international rules . 
  these laws ban suppliers from owning transit facilities such as gas pipelines , and would force gazprom to allow third-party gas producers to use the south stream pipeline . 
  [ 44 ]   on 1 december 2014 , during a state visit to turkey , president putin announced that russia was withdrawing from the project , blaming western sanctions and lack of construction permits in the territory of the european union . 
  [ 4 ] [ 45 ] russia instead intends to build a pipeline through turkey known as turkish stream , although negotiations between russia and turkey have not been finalized . 
  [ 46 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_stream and on december 15 , 2014 the moscow times published [ this article ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/germany-backs-revival-of-russia-s-south-stream-gas-pipeline-project/513348.html ) :  berlin -- german chancellor angela merkel backed bulgaria on monday in its bid to seek new talks with russia about the south stream natural gas pipeline after moscow shelved the project this month in favor of an alternative link via turkey . 
    the eu , at odds with moscow over the ukraine crisis and keen to reduce its energy reliance on russia , had raised objections to the $ 40 billion south stream pipeline , which was to run under the black sea and enter the eu via bulgaria . 
    critics of the plan said they believed it breached eu law , but some eu member states saw the pipeline , which would bypass ukraine , as the best way to secure their own gas supplies and economic interests and still hope it can be revived . 
    `` we need to examine all legal questions surrounding the south stream project and then use these to move discussions forward with russia , '' merkel said after talks with bulgarian prime minister boyko borisov in berlin . 
   germany has shown so much disregard for fellow europeans that it 's fascinating there 's no political voice in germany bringing up the question `` wait , are we actually destroying europe again ? '', 
  yeah . 
  politicians should totally react to \\ / r/europe memes . 
   or if it decided to stick together to sanction russia . 
  but that 's not viable due to german interests . 
  what sanctions against russia has germany vetoed ? 
  the nsa is appeased as well , bnd will help to access the data . 
  turkey has already said that they are not interested to become the refugee dump of the eu . 
  not even visa free travel for turks will make them host every single asylum seeker that enters the eu . 
  but i have to admit it 's very amusing . 
  the biggest economy in the world asks the country that currently hosts more than 2 million syrians for help . 
  turkey , please host 3 million people , so we do n't have to host anyone . 
  let me guess , you are neither a soldier nor a border guard who would shoot at these unarmed civilians ? 
  for the hungarian solution you have to stop people right at the border . 
  if someone smart requests asylum in warsaw , poland ca n't prove which route he took . 
  so they ca n't push them back to that safe country . 
  theory meets reality . 
  yesterday i learned about [ rolling coal ] ( http://www.vocativ.com/culture/society/dicks-pick-trucks-meme-rollin-coal/ ) . 
  maybe that would be something the uk government could subsidize . 
  could show those clean energy liberals who 's the man in the house . 
  romania is not in schengen . 
  and if someone decides to request asylum in poland because that would allow them to live out their extraordinary dreams ( maybe the asylum seeker hates muslims as well ) poland ca n't stop them . 
   the amount has been lower than in germany if it 's about benefits for refugees , germany is n't the most generous country in the eu either . 
  asylum seekers come because someone with an interest in them risking the trip ( i.e. 
  people smugglers ) told them about the paradise in sweden and germany . 
  it does n't matter how the situation actually is . 
  i 've talked to asylum seekers from the balkan who honestly believed that they get an interest free loan in germany to buy a car and build a nice house for their family . 
  because somalia is not a safe country of origin . 
  so you have to check every single asylum application thoroughly . 
   that 's the plan . 
  help those in need while they are in need , tell the rest to fuck off . 
  once that 's the baseline , then we can talk about quotas and sharing the burden . 
  you see , that 's the problem . 
  for you that 's the plan . 
  ask your neighbor if he has the same plan . 
  in q2/2015 the average acceptance ratio for asylum decisions was 45 % . 
  since then the percentage of syrians has only increased . 
  so one can expect that the quota of positive decisions for people that arrive in the eu today is in the high 50s , if not already in the 60s . 
  that 's a lot of people who can stay . 
   he [ mr cameron ] said the crisis is `` the biggest problem facing europe today '' , and told the sailors and royal marines : `` you should be incredibly proud of the lives you have saved . 
  ** there will be people who will live out extraordinary dreams and lives ** that would n't have happened were it not for what you have done in the mediterranean . '' but not in the uk . 
  but they can live out their extraordinary dreams in one of the 26 schengen countries . 
  explanation ! = excuse, 
   but not being willing to take your own citizens back is a strange move that 's also regularly suggested by us eu citizens . 
  granted , we mainly do it when it 's about eu citizens that joined isis and want to return . 
  but rejecting your own citizens is not such a strange idea . 
  sure it 's an asshole reaction and clearly against un conventions and human rights . 
  but reintegrating rejected asylum seekers is not an easy task . 
  they will be angry , criminals will be among them , and many of them wo n't have any place to stay .
