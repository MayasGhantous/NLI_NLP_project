  and then we want to abolish family reunification . 
  and suddenly , syrians have no longer the right to asylum . 
  what ? 
  what we do right now is a waste of time . 
  we hold german coalition summits and agree to change tiny details to hope to deter future asylum seekers . 
  we pretend that everything will be okay if we deny more asylum applications . 
  we pretend that there is a realistic way for us to deport hundreds of thousands of people per year . 
  we pretend so much these days that i have to ask myself , is xenophobic eastern europe right ? 
  maybe we are total idiots and human rights are a waste of money . 
  and then i like to pretend that the eu can work together to solve the crisis in a way that is somewhere between the yes sweden meme and hungary 's tear gas . 
  maybe valletta will mark the beginning of that eu solution . 
  at least i can pretend that until the end of next week . 
  the point is that syrians would no longer receive asylum . 
  they would receive subsidiary protection . 
  apparently syrians do n't fall under the un convention . 
  that might be because there are still parts in syria that are not under threat from isis . 
  and , as i have learned just a couple minutes ago , being from a country that is in civil war does not get you asylum . 
  you only get subsidiary protection , because you are not threatened because of your race , your religion , your sexuality or similar traits . 
   what makes germany believe they can ignore people 's human rights when it suits them ? 
  the law . 
  only refugees that are covered by the un refugee convention qualify for family reunion . 
  it would be an option if the eu would n't be too scared to try to make a deal with the unhcr . 
  the unhcr is always in need of money and help . 
  and they always want to resettle refugees that are actually in need , because they require special medical assistance , are victims of torture , or are under threat in refugee camps . 
  the eu is the biggest economy in the world , we have plenty of money and we have plenty of space . 
  and we have a little problem with illegal migration . 
  a deal could look like this : the eu offers : - multi billion euro funding every year from now on - a quick response team that helps to set up infrastructure in case the unhcr need a camp . 
  the german civil relief agency thw alone could probably fulfill this . 
  - volunteers with skills . 
  i think there are many eu citizen that would help if they would n't have less money when they return . 
  so the eu could pay them a little bit . 
  - temporary resettlement for a set amount of refugees every year , who will be picked by unhcr and eu . 
  if the eu works together 100,000 people per year should be doable . 
  unhcr offers : - to host illegal eu immigrants in their camps it would take only a couple months until every economic migrant in africa or asia knows that they will end in a unhcr camp if they try to enter the eu . 
  no more dead people in the med . 
  no more tear gas against refugees . 
  no more entitled asylum seekers that want to receive their mercedes benz . 
  no more gang rapes . 
  but nope , not going to happen . 
  we still hope that the refugee influx suddenly stops , or that our fences are higher than the ones of our neighbors . 
  so of course we ca n't commit in spending billions of euro every year for refugees . 
  because deep inside we do n't give a fuck about refugees , as long as they do n't come to europe . 
  these laws were made when we had 700,000 asylum seekers last time . 
  back in 1992 , the government agreed on the so called asylkompromiss , they even changed the constitution to stop all the people that came over from yugoslavia . 
  the laws are already as harsh as they can get . 
  but currently no one is using them . 
  merkel and gabriel could cry as long as they want , they ca n't do anything except trying to change the grundgesetz . 
  if the responsible agencies use the german law to the full extent , willkommenskultur is over . 
  according to the current laws only people who enter germany without setting foot in a safe third country can qualify for asylum . 
  since we are surrounded by third safe countries , that means only people that land on the coast , or people who come via plane can qualify for asylum . 
  everyone else can be deported to a place that is not germany . 
  the best way to get people out of a refugee camp is unhcr resettlement . 
  currently asylum seekers tend to get a sense of entitlement because they have paid to get into the eu . 
  maybe he is the only one that actually read the current laws . 
  for christmas i want a frosted 60 watt incandescent light bulb ( not halogen ) . 
  can you tell a couple legal sellers in the eu ? 
   the government is telling people they can buy alcohol , but they can not give alcohol as an new years gift . 
  the government tells shop owners that they are not allowed to put alcohol in the gift baskets they sell . 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes , but that 's literally what the article says :  ** traditional `` new year baskets , '' gift packages of beverages and snacks sold at supermarkets ** during the last weeks of the year , ** will not be permitted to include alcoholic drinks ** this year , according to a ruling from turkey 's alcohol and tobacco regulator . 
   ** how much imagination does it take to change this into a win-win situation ? 
  **   ** none at all . 
  **   ** it just demands a sense of reality ** , a quantum leap of courage , and a couple of changes to german military law to make the bundeswehr into an army that an immigration country needs , so it can serve both the newly arrived immigrants and their new home country . 
    [ ... ]   not only would it have the most translators , reconnaissance scouts , and soldiers who actually know the region and grew up there , ** but also those with the best early warning system for avoiding the wrong path , when it presents itself . 
  ** with one of the first and the last paragraphs combined the whole thing sounds like some sort of sophisticated satire that should highlight the stupidity of many of the proposals we hear in regards to handling the current situation . 
  but i tend to overthink things , so this could actually be a real proposal . 
  they would fit right into the eu . 
  we ban light bulbs , they ban alcohol in gift baskets . 
  the telephone and mp3 . 
  change it to latvia and be done . 
  people outside of the baltics mix the two up constantly anyway . 
  or maybe cooperate with current latvia so they change their name to northern latvia and lithuania names itself southern latvia . 
  and how many of these 2.1 million households and businesses will magically find some money ? 
  if there are no consequences if you do n't pay , people wo n't pay . 
  even if they could pay if they would try hard enough . 
  though it would be nice if they would install prepaid power meters for customers who are n't able to pay . 
  symbolpolitik . 
  the numbers of asylum seekers from safe countries of origin ( not to be confused with safe third countries like every eu country ) decreases every single month , while the number of people from countries who most likely have valid asylum claims grows way faster than the former . 
  so basically like every country that joined after 1953 ? 
  they all come for the economic benefits . 
  and then we try to infect them with our values . 
   best i can tell his major private sector experience is as economist in residence for fucking valve . 
  but he did that for almost a year . 
  which is almost year ** s ** . 
  at least one referendum every weekend . 
  like in switzerland . 
  yes . 
  actually deporting people is hard . 
  way harder than people seem to believe . 
  more like delicious . 
  a similar product is soled by coca-cola in germany , switzerland , austria and finland . 
   take fingerprints , picture , passport data etc in one system and let all countries see into it ... that 's literally how it 's done since 2003 . 
  every asylum seeker gets a file in an electronic eu database called eurodac . 
  including fingerprints . 
  and every member country is obligated to register asylum applicants and irregular border-crossers over the age of 14 . 
  wait until you realize that cost of living in eastern europe are lower than in sweden . 
  guess what , nobody expects eastern europe to give benefits on the level of sweden . 
   as someone from eastern europe at this point i 'm wondering why i should n't just throw away my passport and apply for asylum in sweden . 
  because being an asylum seeker is not as great as people on this sub believe . 
  not even close . 
  are you eu citizen ?
