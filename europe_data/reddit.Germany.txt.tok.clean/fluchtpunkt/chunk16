  we appreciate . '', 
  you know what happens when a german citizen whose parents came to germany in the 60s commits a crime ? 
  people left and write will write `` german '' to point out that this person is not really german . 
  they might be in possession of a german passport . 
  but that 's it . 
  not real german . 
  and you can replace german with any nationality in the eu . 
  if someone with a migration background does something news-worthy the scare quotes will be added to their nationality . 
  no matter how hard a turk , or the child , or even the grandchild of a turk desires to become german , he will always be a turk , he will only be `` german '' . 
   europe has had record high unemployment for years now germany does not have that problem . 
  if you are willing to move , you will have a job within a few weeks . 
  there are plenty of opportunities even for unskilled workers . 
  until recently we still liked to pretend that we are not an immigration society . 
  nope . 
  the money would have been used to pay government debt . 
  for years there have been calls that the german government should increase internal consumption by spending tax money . 
  yes . 
  18 billion euro last year . 
  surplus in the first half of 2015 was already 21.5 billion euro . 
  are you 12 ? 
  you should wonder how many isis fighters did n't even leave for syria . 
  why do n't they use the ten-thousand isis fighters with eu passports that already were in europe ? 
  they smuggled them to syria instead . 
  isis loves to say that they will soon invade the whole world . 
  yes please . 
  do it . 
  what value does the eu have if it ca n't even work together if there are manageable crisis like in the last few years ? 
  it 's better it ends now than we continue to believe that the eu will help in a real crisis . 
  [ seriously ] when did merkel ( or a german government official ) say that asylum seekers should not be registered ? 
  they would send other sons to fight a war . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  they will be treated according the human rights charter . 
  and if they want to leave they just have to reveal their nationality . 
  first they smuggle thousands of isis fighters , that have eu passports , into syria . 
  and now they smuggle thousands back . 
  disguised as refugees . 
  -- fucking buzzfeed should concentrate on stealing content from reddit instead of becoming the mouthpiece of isis . 
  i wonder how that would look if the baseline would be 1995 . 
  at least in germany a big part of the decrease in co2 and pollutants since 1990 was caused by the loss of industry in eastern germany . 
   and is willing to take him hehe . 
  there are many safe countries ( tunisia for example ) that do n't even cooperate to take back their own citizen . 
  we can improvise . 
  they do n't need high security . 
  a guarded fenced-off tent city in the middle of nowhere in rural east germany should suffice . 
  they 'll soon remember where they are from . 
  we simply ca n't afford to host people indefinitely just because they forgot where they are from . 
  the answer is always the same : ask a local charity . 
  just pick one . 
  if they are involved in the refugee situation they 'll tell you where what kind of help is needed . 
  if they are n't , they will tell you where you should ask . 
  they will not get asylum . 
  their application will be rejected , but their deportation will most likely be suspended because nobody knows to which country they belong . 
  if i were in charge i would put people who refuse to cooperate into prison . 
  maybe that helps them to remember a few things about their home country . 
  deported to which country ? 
   but otherwise , it seems that refugees ' claims of who they are and where they are from is currently being taken at face value . 
  what led you to believe that ? 
  it 's lovely how naive these people are . 
  it 's very easy to prove that you have not been living in a specific country . 
  i doubt that you need more than a handful of questions to prove that someone is lying . 
  just give them google earth without labels and ask them to point out some things in their alleged home town . 
  if they would receive the exact same amount of benefits in the whole eu , most refugees would still try to get to germany . 
  why ? 
  because our image is one of the best in the eu . 
  germany means industry , jobs , education , culture , religious freedom , wealth , open-mindnesses . 
  in 2013 , germany had a net positive migration flow with basically every major country in the world . 
  no matter if you look at the usa , russia , the uk , india , china , poland , the netherlands or france . 
  from almost every nationality more people migrated to germany than have moved away . 
  eastern europeans move to germany en masse . 
  are they motivated by greed as well ? 
  or do they just seek a better future ? 
   then there is more points to discuss . 
  what does he mean by family ? 
  and to what extent does reunification laws work ? 
  if i am granted asylum , can i bring my sister or mother ? 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l33118  the following are eligible for family reunification :   - the sponsor 's spouse ;  - the minor children of the couple ( i.e. 
  unmarried children below the legal age of majority in the eu country concerned ) , or of one member of the couple , where he or she has custody and the children are dependent on him or her , including adopted children . 
    eu countries remain free to authorise , under certain conditions , family reunification of :   - first-degree ascendants in the direct line ( father and mother of the foreign national ) ;  - unmarried children above the age of majority ;  - unmarried partners . 
     ** polygamy is not recognised ** ; only one spouse can benefit from the right to reunification . 
  likewise , children of the ineligible spouses are excluded from the right to reunification unless their greater interest warrants it ( pursuant to the 1989 convention on children 's rights ) . 
    eu countries are also permitted to require the non-eu national and his/her spouse to be of a minimum age ( subject to a maximum of 21 years ) , before they can exercise the right to family reunification . 
  from the link i provided :  ** polygamy is not recognised ** ; only one spouse can benefit from the right to reunification . 
  likewise , children of the ineligible spouses are excluded from the right to reunification unless their greater interest warrants it ( pursuant to the 1989 convention on children 's rights ) . 
  this time it 'll work !, 
   i completely disagree on this . 
  refugees who stayed in turkey and jordan should be given first priority for asylum in the eu as they stayed and did things properly . 
  sure . 
  let 's give asylum to 4,000,000 syrians who live in refugee camps . 
  they will be very welcome all over the eu . 
  the people in the eu just do n't want refugees that entered the eu illegally . 
  btw , we opt-out of your 4 million redistribution scheme . 
  let 's hope you wo n't experience the same resentments as many immigrants in europe . 
  because the feed-in tariffs for new solar installations are ( or soon will be ) so low that it will be cheaper to use the energy yourself . 
  i think residential batteries are also subsidized by the kfw . 
  `` germany '', 
  do n't tell them . 
  it 's always nice if you can identify americans from the things they say . 
  it 's also good to know the rules if you want to have an informed opinion . 
  why are you waiting for the eu to do something ? 
  the german federal relief agency was active in refugee camps in lebanon from 2012 to earlier this year .
