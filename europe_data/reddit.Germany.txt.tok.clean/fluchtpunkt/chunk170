  and each time systematic border controls are brought back because of a political summit or a football match , border police catches plenty criminals who did n't get the memo that border controls are back . 
  schengen is great , and the positive effects are bigger than the negative effects . 
  but saying that an increase in cross-border crime is bullshit is still wrong . 
   everyone with half a mind knows the `` corruption '' thing is bullshit when it comes to borders because you do n't allow border guards and government officials who decide about visa applications to be corrupt ? 
  or why exactly does corruption not harm the security of borders ? 
  maybe you should educate yourself about the difference between schengen and eu freedom of movement first . 
  here is something to start : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement_for_workers_in_the_european_union, 
   in between approach of poland and germany - very hard and very soft . 
  complaining to the wto because russia stopped the import of polish apples ? 
   on 7 august , russia banned the import of eu food products , including fruit and vegetables from poland . 
  poland 's total food exports to russia are worth around $ 1.13 billion per year . 
  as the eu 's second biggest apple producer , poland is now stuck with some 700,000 tonnes of the fruit it usually sells to russia . 
    the ban was imposed in response to western economic sanctions against russia , over its annexation of crimea from ukraine , and a pro-russian rebellion in eastern ukraine , which western capitals accuse moscow of fomenting . 
    poland 's economy ministry told the news agency reuters it had sent the request to european trade commissioner karel de gucht , who represents eu members in all wto cases . 
  http://www.euractiv.com/sections/social-europe-jobs/poland-wants-eu-complain-wto-over-russian-embargo-307859 is that your very hard approach ? 
  --  and - again as far as i know - poland was looking for support to follow lisbon treaty and implement a common energy policy . 
  any links so i can read more about the polish concept of the common energy policy ? 
  not being in schengen does not stop any eu citizen from going to other eu countries . 
  they just have to show their passports . 
  the problem is alleged corruption of government officials . 
  the fear is that romanian government officials hand out schengen-visa for people who are not eligible . 
   the eu funds is the compensation paid to e.european countries for them being in the common market the eu funds are used to help build infrastructure in the eu . 
  that 's why even germany receives money from the eu infrastructure funds . 
  eastern europe gets more money from the infrastructure funds because eastern europe has more infrastructure projects that are eligible for eu assistance . 
  but i really have to wonder why whole eastern europe was so stupid to join the eu . 
  experts like you could have easily foreseen that eastern europe loses billions of euro per year . 
  i hope you are able to leave the eu soon , so you can finally turn your country into the economic powerhouse it deserves to be . 
  eads , the european aeronautic defence and space company . 
  the multi-national group that is now known as airbus group . 
  so basically every country was tricked to join the eu by germany and france . 
  can the eu sue romania if corrupt government officials grant schengen visa for people who are n't eligible ? 
  in that case maybe romania should have taken the more expensive bid from another company ? 
  let me quote the article . 
   the agreement signed last week between russia 's gazprom pjsc and ** european companies including royal dutch shell plc , eon ag and engie ** to expand the nord stream pipeline under the baltic sea , `` completely neglects polish interests , '' duda said tuesday at an economic forum in krynica , poland . 
  germany , i.e. 
  the german government did n't sign anything . 
  in germany businesses do n't have to ask the government if they are allowed to do business in areas that are n't regulated . 
  if germany would n't give a fuck about eu unity there would be no eu wide sanctions against crimea/russia . 
  would you say that the uk is not more than a market for german and french products ? 
   eastern european countries should form a separate , maybe polish led block . 
  yes please . 
  i 'm looking forward to see everyone in eastern europe blaming warsaw . 
  does polish pegida fly russian flags as well ? 
  and do they decline any interview with media that is n't rt ? 
  that 's what they do in dresden . 
  also known as the balkan filibuster . 
  on what base can you assume that ? 
  it depends on the date that you want to call start of the civil war in syria , but you have something between half a year and a year left , and the 5 years are over for the first arrivals . 
  the [ siege of homs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_homs ) started in may 2011 . 
  -- but does n't matter because , to quote the article :  norway 's right-wing government is to limit grants of asylum to a five-year term , after which refugees will be automatically sent home ** if the situation in their country has changed for the better ** . 
   political situation in germany can for example drasticaly change any day now . 
  afd is already at 6 % in the country-wide polls !, 
  no need to be slavo-anything . 
  pick one : 1 . refugees go to germany because they are economic opportunist who want the most benefits 2 . refugees that know the german language , and are living in germany for at least 6 years , have or had a long-term full-time job with a minimum wage of 8.50 $ in germany , will mass-migrate to eastern europe once they gain german citizenship, 
  do you even know what conservative means ? 
  because people with jobs in germany ( that is one of the requirements to become a german citizen ) will totally move to poland to work for much less money . 
  the almighty v4 should just erect that zone . 
   she did say that germany wont turn away syrians . 
  eu wide protection rate for asylum applicants from syria was 96 % in the second quarter of 2015 . 
  nobody in the eu turns away syrians . 
   curiously nobody questions the fact that all these migrants do come from ( because through ) only one country :   ** turkey . 
  ** because that is n't true ? 
  yep . 
  if people ca n't buy bread on sunday , they will just use their g6 to buy it in the united states . 
  global competitiveness is very important for local shops !, 
  in the first 8 months of 2015 200,000 people requested asylum in germany . 
  weeks before merkel send her `` invitation '' , the federal office for migration and refugees said that they expect 800,000 asylum seekers in 2015 . 
  and i can guarantee you that they did n't know that merkel would `` invite '' all those people . 
  4 countries , romania , the czech republic , slovakia and hungary have voted against mandatory quotas . 
  not 27 . 
   after being ussr 's puppets for 45 years , the last thing ee countries want is to be dictated by mutti 's caliphate . 
  easy . 
  just leave the eu . 
  then you are no longer influenced by eu decisions . 
  you seem to believe that the asylum process is the easy part of hosting refugees . 
  it 's not . 
  `` let 's just kick them out '' is easier said then done . 
  and stupid east europe was tricked into joining . 
  the voting system in the us is very different from the voting system in germany . 
  you do n't need to show proof of citizenship in germany because you simply wo n't be invited to vote if you are n't a citizen . 
  and without that invitation you ca n't vote . 
  the option to get citizenship is limited to refugees that do n't require welfare , and are in germany for at least 6 years . 
  at that point merkel wo n't be a candidate to vote for . 
  but do n't let that stop you , keep the conspiracy theories coming . 
   teh church bells that have rung fro 200 years ? 
  kiss them goodbye , the muslims dont feel welcome sounds awesome . 
  worst case scenario the uk has to trade with the eu according to wto rules . 
  like every other country that does n't have a trade agreement with the eu . 
   just as most norwegians prefer their current arrangement to being in the uk , i think most brits would too . 
  if it makes sense for most norwegians , why would n't it also make sense for most brits ? 
  in that case many brexit supporters use the wrong arguments . 
  `` we do n't want uncontrolled immigration '' , `` we want to negotiate trade agreements without interference from the eu '' and `` brussel should not dictate uk laws '' are not good arguments if you want to become a second norway . 
  crystal meth, 
   eurosceptics have argued that the uk would still enjoy favourable trading terms with the eu even if it left , often citing norway , which is not a member but is still the fifth biggest exporter to the bloc . 
  i still do n't get that . 
  do people in the uk not know what norway 's relationship to the eu is ? 
  do n't they know that norway has to follow plenty eu rules to be part of the single market ? 
  what fucking sense does it make to leave the eu just to become another norway ? 
  so you do n't have any say in the rules you have to follow ? 
  all those polish plumbers that invade the uk to take away jobs and leech unemployment benefits ?
