  being the next norway wont keep them out either . 
  because to be part of the single market norway had to implement freedom of movement . 
  instead of complaining that they have to trade with the eu under wto rules , they should be happy about that . 
  because that 's the only way to keep the fucking eu out of the uk . 
  you ca n't relocate people to turkey , without declaring them a safe country . 
  mercury-vapor lamps emit a whiter light . 
  the light from sodium-vapor lamps is orange . 
  britain got an opt-out , otherwise they would be part of the eu proposal . 
  many eu countries resettled in total tens of thousands of syrians in 2013 . 
  germany resettled 20,000 for example . 
  and exactly the same number that were resettled from refugee camps to germany in 2013 . 
  britain smart , everyone else dumb . 
   you will never get those numbers . 
  germany - the main destination - have split the responsibility over a mess of organizations , so they do not know what is happening , and they have no valid numbers . 
  i 'm not sure where you get that from , bamf publishes pretty detailed asylum numbers on a monthly basis . 
  and once a year they publish a long report about migration in general . 
  getting proper education is a weird priority if you want to earn money . 
   unfortunately , this video is not available in your country because it could contain music from umg , for which we could not agree on conditions of use with gema . 
  -- one day media rights will be unified across the globe . 
  that day should become a national holiday . 
   there are actually people speculating do they , by any chance , wear tinfoil hats or talk about jews a lot ? 
  from what i [ understood ] ( https://youtu.be/t36obmnbcrg?t=43s ) from the video , it uses lasers . 
   well she did tell other eu countries to forget shengan and open your borders and send them on through she never said that . 
  and let 's be realistic , that 's what every country in the eu did and does anyway . 
  more than [ 100,000 people requested asylum in hungary between q2/2014 and q2/2015 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_time_asylum_applicants,_q2_2014_\u2013_q2_2015.png ) . 
  highest number of applications per capita in the eu . 
  where are all those people ? 
  in germany , austria , denmark , sweden , finland . 
  nothing changed . 
   in her podcast , merkel said germany needed to make clear that those who needed protection would get it but those who were only coming here for economic reasons would have to leave again . 
  that 's what she said in her two `` invitations '' . 
  the law still does n't know a limit for legitimate refugees . 
  and syrians who apply for asylum in germany will not be send to the first eu country they entered . 
  so you believe the crisis started to unfold in the last week of august 2015 ? 
  weeks before that the federal agency for migration and refugees already said that germany expects 800,000 asylum seekers this year . 
  at this point of the year there were 200,000 asylum seekers in germany . 
  so they either did know what merkel would say weeks later , or they expected a massive increase themselves . 
  so maybe , just maybe , the influx would have increased without merkels statement as well ? 
  like it did last september , and the september before that , and the september before that . 
  here 's are the asylum statistics from sweden : http://www.migrationsverket.se/om-migrationsverket/statistik/asylsokande---de-storsta-landerna.html you can clearly see an increase around september . 
  and as far as i know , merkel did not announce `` come one , come all '' in 2014 , 2013 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . 
  maybe there is a more natural cause for that increase . 
  she never said anything even close to that . 
  before the quoted sentence she said that there is hope that the minsk agreement can be implemented if talks continue . 
  so i think she refers to the minsk agreement . 
  which does not cover crimea . 
  germany will applaud because the mighty v4 have realized that `` not our problem '' and `` they will go to germany anyway '' does n't solve anything . 
   and once people recognize who is chiefly behind pushing the importing of these hostile aliens into these lands which knew relative peace , the natives will be indifferent to it at best even though they 've been shamed from birth about the nazi regime as if they have any kind of blame for something that happened before they were even born . 
  yes yes . 
  let me quote the article :  the report , published by the eu 's agency for fundamental rights ( fra ) , found that there were ** 1,596 recorded hate crimes against jewish people ** last year in germany , the highest level since 2009 . 
  in 2014 , the figure stood at 1,275 incidents . 
    ** more than 1,300 of the perpetrators were classed as `` right-wing '' ** , seven were `` left-wing '' and 176 were motivated by `` foreign ideology '' , according to the report . 
  the latter figure has risen from 31 in 2013 . 
  you think brits are concerned about nordstream 2 ? 
  refugees . 
  what else . 
  it was the fact that they did n't knew they would get a visit from a politician , yet alone a woman that nobody knows . 
  10 years ago spiegel had an [ article ( german ) ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40788889.html ) about the photo . 
  it seems that she was quite liked by the men . 
  she drank a couple shots with them and they talked about the situation of the fishermen . 
  the `` german economic news '' actually sound like a reputable news source , but they are n't . 
  they are pretty much a conspiracy blog . 
  if the germans are outraged , why is her approval rating still 54 % ? 
  but i like how you are outraged because merkel single-handedly violated the constitution , and just a few sentence before you want the bundeswehr to do policing tasks . 
  guess what , that 's also against the constitution . 
  are television polls these call-in thingies where you have to pay between 25 and 50 cent per vote ? 
  according to many of these before the last federal elections , we would be ruled by the afd by now . 
  not in a coalition , but absolute majority . 
   yes , i thought it was for advancing the cause of world peace . 
  yep . 
  that 's why barack ` drone strike ' obama got one . 
   perhaps , but as a whole , jews are leaving europe in droves ( especially from france ) . 
  so merkel will not turn germany into a jew-free country ? 
  if you are n't a refugee , without scare-quotes , you are not eligible for family reunification . 
  if you make 100 000 a year , how the fuck are you paying for land and construction of a building if the planted roof alone costs 100 000 ? 
   it 's generally only used for large infrastructure projects . 
  but it 's generally possible for all kinds of public use . 
  sure thing . 
  that 's what entrepreneurs do . 
  buy buildings and let them sit around completely empty and unused for years . 
  do n't worry , your country has similar laws . 
  every single country in the world has similar laws . 
  otherwise infrastructure projects would never be possible . 
  want to build a road ? 
  sorry , there 's one guy who does n't want to sell his property . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  for starters , before you deport someone to a country , you contact the authorities of that country . 
  they then figure out if that person is actually a citizen of the country . 
  according to the oecd 10500 people commit suicide in france yearly . 
  naturally many of them do it because of economic reasons . 
  why should i care about 600 farmer suicides in particular ? 
  because they have powerful lobbyists and tractors that can blockade brussels ? 
  that should answer the question why the us want to exclude germany from the syrian peace talks . 
  and without the right to veto it will be an even bigger joke , because the unsc would cease to exist . 
  terrible and not true . 
  have you clicked on these statements ? 
  http://i.imgur.com/h7ier83.jpg such a thing could probably be heated , so they do n't have to suffer finish cold . 
  i 'm speculating , but i assume they have to get their tap water in the bathroom . 
  i know a couple people who are perfectly okay with drinking tap water .
