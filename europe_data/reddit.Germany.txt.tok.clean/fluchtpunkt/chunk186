  the highest german court on the other hand has ruled that according to german law all legal residents have a right to a minimum life standard . 
  and if they ca n't afford that themselves , the state has to pay welfare . 
  even in the first 90 days of their residency , and after that even if they are n't workers . 
  they wanted to limit these for all eu citizens . 
  which would have covered people who are workers . 
  which is not allowed under eu rules . 
  --  the main proposals in the speech - which are dependent on mr cameron remaining in power after may 's general election - are : '   - ** stopping eu migrants from claiming in-work benefits , such as tax credits , and getting access to social housing for four years **  - ** stopping migrants claiming child benefit for dependents living outside the uk **  - removing migrants from the uk after six months if they have not found work  - restricting the right of migrants to bring non-eu family members into the uk  - stopping eu jobseekers claiming universal credit  - speeding up deportation of convicted criminals  - longer re-entry bans for beggars and fraudsters removed from the uk  - stopping citizens from new eu entrants working in the uk until their economies have `` converged more closely '' . 
   - extra money for communities with high levels of migrants   mr cameron ruled out a temporary cap on migrant numbers or an `` emergency brake '' on eu freedom of movement rules , ideas both mooted in recent months , saying this would be less `` effective '' than reducing the incentives for people to come to the uk . 
  i bolded the ones that discriminate against eu workers . 
   the package cameron got was only related to in-work benefits not out-of work benefits actually . 
  because it was not necessary to allow the uk to curb out-of work benefits . 
  because the eu does n't require countries to pay out-of work benefits unless the eu citizen has worked for a significant time in the country . 
  do you believe germany violates eu law with this new legislation ? 
  wrong . 
  germany wants to limit welfare access by eu citizens that ** do n't ** work . 
  the uk wants to limit welfare access by eu citizens that ** do ** work . 
  after 90 days freedom of movement becomes freedom of movement for workers ( and people who can afford to live abroad ) . 
  according to eu law , non-workers do n't need to have access to welfare . 
  germany enacts these legislation because according to german law even non-working residents have a right to welfare . 
  according to eu law only people who have worked for a significant time become eligible for out of work benefits . 
  the new german legislation wo n't change that . 
  but with the new legislation people will no longer be able to work for 6 months and then bring over their family of 10 to receive welfare . 
  so all north african men should apologies because there are north african men that commit rape . 
  lol indeed . 
  they ca n't lump everyone together with rapists . 
  let me just lump everyone together with rapists . 
  they changed the headline , after they were no longer confused respectively after the value bounced back a bit . 
  the url of the article says confusion-as-pound-falls-10-in-insane-asian-trading-and-no-one-knows-why , which was their original headline . 
  it 's a solid logic . 
  finland might join nato because it feels threatened by russia . 
  let 's threaten finland a bit more . 
  then we can complain about nato expanding and encircling peaceful russia . 
  after `` to prevent the rise of the extreme right we have to become the extreme right '' we now have `` to prevent the rise of the extreme right we have to let them do what they want '' too . 
  the finnish readiness to join nato . 
  maybe that 's why you are n't a currency speculator . 
  considering that ukraine is russias backyard , putin would love when the eu ignores international law in its backyard . 
   if the eu 27 all agree on this all throughout negotiations then sure , it 's likely uk will be outside of single market that 's the wrong way round . 
  if all 27 other eu countries agree to a compromise , the uk can be part of the single market . 
  lucky you . 
  i have to fight against brown children . 
  we have two of the worst in our neighborhood . 
  they are sisters , children of syrian refugees , i guess they are 4 and 5 years old . 
  they are always hiding in the bushes , when a white european walks by they jump out and scream `` hallo '' ( i believe that 's german for as-sal\u0101mu \u02bfalaykum ) and then they start to giggle . 
  once they gave you a heart attack they want to talk to you about ~ ~ sharia law ~ ~ kindergarten . 
  every fucking day they harass me by singing me songs they 've learned . 
  go back to syria to sing your depressing songs about autumn . 
  but at least they are picking up that beautiful saxon dialect . 
  muhammed is the most common turkish-arabic name for newborns in germany , and it ranked 41 in the overall list . 
  the birth rate in eastern germany is actually higher and always has been higher than in the western parts . 
  it dropped significantly after the reunification , but it never went down to western levels . 
  and it 's probably because of child care facilities . 
  if you compare child care facilities and their attendance rates you 'll see that there are way more in the eastern parts , and the attendance rates are much much higher . 
  in the gdr it was accepted and even expected that mothers start working soon after giving birth . 
  while you were at work your child would socialize with other children of their age in the kinderkrippe ( for children as young as 3 months , but usually 1 year ) , in kindergarten and in the schulhort ( after-school care ) . 
  only very few mothers became stay-at-home moms . 
  and nobody called you out for giving your 1 year old child `` away '' to the kinderkrippe . 
  nowadays , and especially in the western parts that 's different . 
  back then many companies had their own or an associated kinderkrippe or kindergarten , which had schedules that were perfectly synced with the work of the parents . 
  nowadays if your work start 6:00 you 'll have problems finding a kindergarten that opens before that . 
  and that system of associated child care facilities is slowly coming back , in whole germany . 
  the hospital in my city ( east ) has recently opened a kindergarten for their employees . 
  with great success , it has boosted the number of job applications they receive . 
  many other companies have started to cooperate with child care facilities as well . 
   for sure , germans value their new middle eastern friends and do n't see any problems at all regarding the non-eu migration . 
  i never said that . 
  let me guess , you were n't even in the army . 
  i know because you 're talking like shooting at people is like in a video game . 
  just shoot them . 
  no biggie . 
  they wo n't even shoot back . 
   where is this fear coming from ? 
  if you only read international media a significant part of the news about germany will be about asylum seekers and refugees . 
  if you only read the international media that makes it into reddit 90 % of the news about germany is about asylum seekers and refugees . 
  in that case we 're safe . 
  because almost all migrants in germany do n't cause trouble . 
   i do n't know any guy that is not in the bw and still has a solid base of knowledge about the conflict in afghanistan , not even mentioning the isaf / oef participation of the bw . 
   if you want to see surprised faces , tell germans that kfor is still a thing , and that the bundeswehr is the largest troop contributor . 
  and then they 'll stop migration from europe . 
  because 52 % of all babies born to non-german mothers have european ( excluding turkey ) mothers . 
   new, 
   there are 48k babies from european mother followed by 25k mothers from asia ( not sure whether this includes births from turkish mothers which is 21k ) there were 48k babies from ** other ** european countries . 
  from countries that were n't listed in the table before . 
  if you sum up all the european countries that are n't turkey you end up with 78,852 . 
  or 53 % of all babies that were born to a foreign mother . 
   plus the you can see that the middle eastern mothers ( syria etc ) will increase at-least by two order of magnitude in years to come ... because you say so . 
    the number of babies born to romanian women rose by 47 percent in 2015 ( to 8,154 , compared to 5,551 in 2014 )   5k or 8k is chump change compared to numbers posted ...  8,154 romanian mothers is chump change . 
  but the 4,829 syrian mothers are a sign of the planned white genocide . 
  top 10 of babies born to foreign mothers : - 21,555 babies from turkish women - 10,831 babies from polish women - 8,154 babies from romania - 7,146 kosovo - 5,982 italy - 5,616 serbia - 5,458 russia - 4,800 syria - 4,202 bulgaria - 3,245 greece - others : 70,887 the top 10 countries make up 52 % of all ( 147,905 ) babies born to foreign mothers . 
  and foreign babies make up exactly 20 % of all ( 737,575 ) babies born in germany https://www.destatis.de/de/presseservice/presse/pressemitteilungen/2016/09/pd16_332_126.html, 
  the various military airports throughout the country should be more than enough . 
  no need to build a terminal that will be useless in a few years . 
  so war is only sometimes good for business ? 
   inner european borders were only necessary once merkel let in all the refugees . 
  merkel should have never tore down the border fences in hungary and slovenia that protected the schengen zone from uncontrolled migration . 
  more like 70 - % . 
  of the 305,715 asylum requests that were made in the eu in q2/2016 90,455 came from syrians . 
  lobbyists do a lot to exploit the proletariat . 
  just about stealing money from the population to live the oligarch life . 
  and how the western world supports them . 
   it takes a certain kinda man with a certain reputation  to alleviate the cash from a whole entire nation  take my loose change and build my own space station  just because you can , man  [ ... ]  i put a bank inside a car inside a plane inside a boat  it takes half the western world just to keep my ship afloat  and i never ever smile unless i 've something to promote  i just wo n't emote,
