  so you will pay import sales tax when you bring a good from norway to sweden or vice versa . 
  in that case you can get back the sales tax you paid in the exporting country . 
  both countries have 25 % sales tax , so the cost is close to 0 . 
  if you do n't request reimbursing of the swedish sales tax importing gets quite expensive obviously . 
  since norway is part of the eu single market , you do n't have to pay tariffs for goods that originated in the eu single market . 
  it also does n't matter if you are private person or a business . 
  no one is exempt from import sales taxes , except if the good is valued less than the threshold , which in the case of norway is nok 350 , or around 39 $ .

  very good .

  where can i read more about these liquidity throttlers ? 
  sounds fancy . 
  outside of zerohedge preferably . 
  sorry , but i do n't speak mexican . 
  can you provide a translation ? 
   i think people in the eurozone need that pointed out though . 
  in that case : thank you for your service . 
  until now no one in the euro zone has heard anything bad about the euro . 
  it 's just too easy to overlook the daily articles that bombard us with doom and gloom about the euro . 
  and if you do n't go to the bookstore regularly you probably do n't even realize that stiglitz writes a whole fucking book about how bad the euro is every week . 
  thanks for creating this thread , so eurozone sheeple can learn that not everyone believes that the euro is the best thing since ever . 
  you did n't even exclude 94 % of the population like the white commonwealth of nations ( canzuk ) does . 
  so i guess it 's a good thing that america does n't want loaned money back from deutsche bank . 
  -----  after all the money germany loans to greece , goes to greek banks , and from there back to german banks , meaning the money is recycled in a loophole . 
  that 's how money works . 
  the economy is all about moving money around . 
  an example : you work for vw . 
  you decide to buy a nice vw that costs 40,000 euro . 
  but you do n't have that money so you ask the vw bank for a loan . 
  they make a deal with you , you do n't have to pay interest but they get your full salary until you have paid back the whole sum . 
  ( do n't worry , your wife has an income as well ) . 
  a week later you crash the car . 
  unfortunately you did n't bring the insurance application to the mailbox in time , so you have no insurance , and the scrap metal dealer only gave you 100 $ for the car , so you basically turned your 40,000 euro investment into 100 $ . 
  so you work at the vw factory for two years , but as soon as the factory transfers that money to you , you have to transfer it to the bank . 
  according to your logic you were ripped off because you had to work for free . 
  because the money they gave you went to the bank and the bank gave it back to vw , meaning the money was recycled in a loophole . 
  in germany we call calculations that are based on naive or wrong assessments a milchm\u00e4dchenrechnung . 
  a milkmaid-calculation . 
  according to our duden ( the official dictionary of the german language ) it goes back to a french folktale about a milk girl . 
  while she walked to the market she pictured what she could buy with the money she gets for selling the milk . 
  she could buy 100 eggs , then she could sell the chickens to buy a pig . 
  then she would sell the pig and get another cow . 
  then she tripped and spilled all the milk . 
  ** warning : questionable statistics interpretation ahead . 
  proceed with caution !, 
  viewers discretion is advised !, 
  ** the statistics say that british men are almost as ugly . 
  27.5 % of the mothers who gave birth in the uk in 2015 were born outside the uk . 
  and 27.2 % of the fathers were born outside the uk . 
  but if you like naive assessments as much as i do , you could spot a trend if you look at individual countries .

   so hungary should had done background checks on all 150k + people who applied for asylum ? 
  call me back when your country is done doing the background checks for the 800k + you currently got . 
  orban should just shut the fuck about about merkels open door policy . 
  because it was hungary that actually had the open door in its country . 
  hungary is n't the savior of europe . 
  hungary was one of the countries that were jointly responsible for letting the flow of asylum seekers grow to that massive size . 
  there are many others , but hungary is one of them too . 
   there were over 1400 police operations due to crude force inside berlin refugee camps alone last year . 
  where can i read more about that ? 
  he 's trying to tell you that turks can do whatever they want because they vote for the parties that social workers like . 
  the social worker in that case is the person that tells turkish parents that they have to send their kids to school . 
  or the person that works at the unemployment office and decides over sanctions . 
  and according to op they allow more levy with turks because social workers all vote for spd/green , so turks are their allies . 
  because they vote or would vote for these parties too . 
  it 's basically a huge conspiracy among the central left . 
  and merkel is part of it !, 
   but we know that police do n't report or even hides identity of many perpetrators . 
  to the public . 
  and the perpetrator will pay for it anyway . 
  so where is the threat of sanctions ? 
   the important thing is it was only a threat over the use of a border fence . 
  it was a threat over their ignorance towards eu and international laws that grant refugees certain rights . 
  they let in tens of thousands basically uncontrolled . 
  [ between april and september 2015 more then 140,000 people requested asylum in hungary . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/2/22/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_q2_2015_\u2013_q2_2016.png ) but they tried to contain them in hungarian camps . 
  then the asylum seekers protested and rioted because they did n't want to stay in hungary . 
  which prompted merkel to say that hungary can let them through , and that germany would n't request dublin relocations for syrians that entered via hungary . 
  meanwhile hungary build the fence . 
  and saved europe . 
  and merkel destroyed europe by inviting the whole world . 
  last year hungary had the highest number of asylum applications per capita in the eu . 
  because there was no fence for the most part of 2015 . 
  what exactly was merkels gun ? 
  and why does n't she have that gun anymore ? 
  at least we get a free ^ ^ \\* maple leaf .
