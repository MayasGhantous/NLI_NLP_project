  or what ? 
  yes . 
  that 's precisely what i said . 
  because if you are responsible for pregnancy in consensual sex you are also responsible for becoming pregnant during rape . 
  you can also state that people are responsible for their own death if they get murdered . 
  because i said that people are responsible for their death if they commit suicide . 
   so man 's phychic problem arent a thing , y-yes ? 
  yes . 
  that 's precisely what i said . 
  again . 
  because i was the one who who ignored psychological problems and i was the one who believes that everything is fine as long as she 's reimbursed for the 2 days she ca n't work because of her abortion . 
  or she just does n't tell you for the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy and then you can no longer weasel out of being a father . 
   again , why do you want to force anticonception only for men , you dont mention women part in that . 
  i mean they are both responsible , arent they ? 
  you want to make `` legal abortion '' available for men , why should i then talk about women ? 
  it 's pretty easy . 
  ** you ** do n't want to pay child support ? 
  ** you ** make sure that your sex partner does n't get pregnant . 
  ** you ** do n't want to give birth or do n't want an abortion ? 
  ** you ** make sure that you do n't become pregnant . 
   i agree for men and women share costs of everything that comes out of abortion including her lost paycheque during and after they procedure and her health complications . 
  what price do you put on her psyche ? 
  because it 's a stupid concept . 
  if that human being exists it has to be cared for . 
  and that requires money . 
  that does n't change no matter how often you repeat `` legal abortion '' . 
  do n't want to pay child support ? 
  get a vasectomy and use condoms . 
  actual aborting an unwanted child can have very severe negative consequences for the woman . 
  weaseling out of paying child support does n't come with any negative consequences . 
  the two things are n't even related , yet alone equal . 
   what ? 
  of course not . 
  terrorism targets the general population was the red army faction a terrorist group ? 
   leaving the eu would take two years two years is the negotiation period that is granted to every country that wants to leave . 
  but there is no minimum time you have to stay in the eu after invoking article 50 . 
  if you do n't want to keep your privileges , and if you continue with your obligations , you could probably leave within weeks . 
  you leave the eu when the negotiated agreement comes into effect , or if there 's no agreement reached after 2 years ( unless everyone unanimously decides to prolong the negotiation period ) . 
  unfortunately we ca n't ask him , but i doubt that he would approve violent acts by anyone in germany . 
   question : how many refugees was he planning on bringing over ? 
  not his decision . 
  but apparently there were no concrete plans for hosting asylum seekers at all . 
  they were about to discuss the renovation of an old apartment building with 4 apartments . 
  and some locals feared that asylum seekers could move into these apartments . 
  which would be bad for property values . 
  the neighbor village kisdorf , population 3600 , hosts 40 asylum seekers . 
  they do n't have any problems . 
  and the mayor does n't get death threats either . 
   he has power , and he 's ( presumably ) using it to hurt his people . 
  the mayor has basically no say in things related to asylum . 
  that 's a matter of the federal government , the state and the administrative district . 
  everyone gets a number and a date from the higher up and then figures out how that number can be distributed in their area of responsibility before the deadline runs out . 
  the mayor is last in this chain , and he ( or more precise , the city/municipality council ) can decide where to host them in his municipality , but that 's it . 
  the municipality has absolutely no say about how many to host , what nationalities they have , what personal status or what age or gender distribution the asylum seekers have . 
  mayors get attacked because they are easy targets , not because they make the decisions . 
  and no , there were no plans to host 2000 asylum seekers in that 900 people village . 
  they were about to discuss plans for renovating an old apartment building they have bought . 
  and some people thought asylum seekers could move into these apartments . 
  the number of apartments that would be created in that building ? 
  four . 
  it 's not a yearly thing . 
  because the number of asylum seekers that have entered germany in 2016 has already decreased significantly . 
  and the numbers wo n't rise again . 
  even merkel wo n't let a situation like last year happen again . 
  on the other hand the numbers of deportations of rejected asylum seekers have raised significantly as well , naturally still on a low level though . 
  but that number will also continue to raise in the future . 
  contrary to popular believe , not even merkel wants to host economic migrants , and everyone wants to deport them . 
  and do n't forget that good old white europeans also move to germany . 
  686,000 eu citizens moved to germany in 2015 , net migration was at 382,000 . 
  62 % of them fall into the < 35 category . 
  though that covers women and men . 
  i 'm too lazy now to bring out the migration report to look up the gender distribution among eu immigrants . 
  it 's probably around 60-70 % male . 
  so if we just take net migration into account we are looking at 140,000 < 35 year old males from eu countries that entered the `` population replacement program '' in 2015 . 
  but that number will at least stay stable in the coming years . 
  and that number has also been in a similar range in the last years . 
  if we look at the last 5 years , or the next 5 years instead of 2015 we 'll see that more white eu-citizens than brown people entered the demography . 
  if people are honest they have to adopt the npd opinion and include all migrants , which includes fellow eu citizen , when talking about the good ole ' population replacement . 
  because the actual risk that the asylum seekers make anyone a minority is pretty slim . 
  does migrant in your posting actually mean migrant or does it mean asylum seeker ? 
  because if it 's the latter , of these 1.5 million asylum seekers only 890,000 [ actually ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-interior-minister-revises-2015-refugee-influx-from-11-million-to-890000/a-35932746 ) came to germany . 
  if it 's the former the number is too low . 
  because of these 1.5 million migrants 686,000 were citizens from other eu countries . 
  but the majority of them is also male and under 35 . 
  -- and if we use the asylum applications of last year as a basis , only 57 % of the applicants were male and under the age of 35 . 
  ( tabelle i-4 , ` ( 21529 +8037 +17676 +17233 +16253 +88121 +50828 +32923 ) / 441899 ` ) so we are now looking at 507,300 people ( 57 % of the 890,000 that entered germany ) in that 25 million group . 
  population replacement down to 2 % . 
  and considering that the number of people who entered germany has declined significantly ( until 21 september 210,000 people have entered germany in 2016 ) we will see a population replacement of 0 . x % . 
  and in the year after and the year after and the year after that number will most likely decrease further . 
  numbers from : https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2015-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationfile, 
   `` those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable '' - jfk i doubt that jfk meant that thugs who believe they are speaking for the majority are allowed to act violently . 
  we have political parties that propose that peaceful `` revolution '' . 
  people are allowed to vote in secret in germany . 
  there are no negative consequences for voting a far right party . 
  there is also no election fraud . 
  vote the afd into a position where it can decide policy and you have your peaceful revolution . 
   maybe they 'll ask you for a drink from my blood ? 
  the embryo wo n't choose anything , because it is neither physically nor mentally able to make decisions . 
  you are pro-birth . 
  you do n't give a fuck about the life of the child after it is born .
