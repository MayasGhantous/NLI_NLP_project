  and to prevent corrosion and calcification the water used in heating systems has to meets certain specifications that normal tap water does n't meet . 
   it would cost basically as much as opening all of the hot taps in your house , 24/7 . 
  no need to drain it , you can circulate hot tap water as well . 
  which gives you basically instant hot water at your taps . 
  and it allows weird things like having radiators that run on hot tap water and therefor work independent from main heating . 
  though i 'm pretty sure that this radiator running from tap water system would be illegal in germany . 
   i would buy new almost every time . 
  though you would have to pay more . 
  you wo n't get 12 new planes for 200 million us-dollar, 
   considering germany calls most of the shots in the eu citation needed . 
  tradition mainly . 
  and of course on a sail ship you are much closer to the elements than on a modern navy vessel . 
  which is good for learning basic seamanship . 
  it 's also a good exercise in leadership , at the start of the cruise the trainees are closely managed by the crew , but the trainees start to lead themselves rather quickly and the crew just observes and intervenes when necessary . 
  team building or however you want to call it , there 's just not much you can do without working together as a coherent team . 
  in germany only officers undergo training on the tall ship gorch fock . 
  the current [ gorch fock ( 1958 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorch_fock_\\ ( 1958 \\ ) ) is a modernized version of the old [ gorch fock ( 1933 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorch_fock_\\ ( 1933 \\ ) ) . 
  the romanian ship is actually a sister ship of the old gorch fock , she was build for the romanian navy . 
  another sister ship of the old one is now with the us coast guard , now named [ eagle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uscgc_eagle_\\ ( wix-327 \\ ) ) . 
  she 's also used for training . 
  our only aircraft carrier is already [ there ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/55\u00b016'59.8%22n+18\u00b025'33.1%22e/@55.2370769,17.7126833,8.27z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d55.283286!4d18.425858 ) . 
  waiting 80 meters below the surface for its mission . 
  now russia is responsible for it , they received it as a war trophy and sank it there in 1947 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_aircraft_carrier_graf_zeppelin, 
  or by the file name . 
  yes . 
  we even have a tv series about them . 
  which was built 1938 in germany . 
  implementing the americans with disabilities act for the f-35b . 
   germany is n't allowed to have carriers an often repeated myth . 
  the last thing i know is that they tried to auction it , but nobody wanted to bid . 
  italy . 
  the pictured giuseppe garibaldi is the only carrier of the three that is still in service with its navy . 
  the french foch was decommissioned in 2000 and sold to brazil , the spanish pr\u00edncipe de asturias was decommissioned in 2013 . 
  only on [ db.de ] ( http://db.de ), 
   this is pure bs , for multiple reasons :   first of all , they are suing because of our plans . 
  nothing has even passed any sort of legislative anything . 
  it 's called the [ infrastrukturabgabengesetz ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/infrag/ ) and it entered into force on 12 . 
  june 2015 . 
  but its implementation was put on hold because the eu commission raised objections against the law . 
   customs is the only thing that needs to be done if the uk leaves the single market if they leave the eu customs union . 
  which is a given . 
  otherwise they could n't get their own trade agreements . 
  single market and customs union are two different entities . 
  for example norway is part of the single market , but not part of the customs union . 
  good entering the eu customs union at the norway-swedish border are subject to taxes and duties ( if their country of origin is outside the single market ) . 
  yes . 
  that 's why these benefits ca n't be granted to countries outside the eu , or in this case outside the eea . 
  if the uk wants to be a participant of the single market they have to join eea . 
  they wo n't get single market benefits without that . 
  i 'm not sure if there 's a solution that does n't involve at least checkpoints on the major roads . 
  ireland is part of the eu customs union . 
  even if the uk becomes a full eea member the uk wo n't be part of the eu customs union , because they want to negotiate their own trade agreements . 
  so there must be customs checks between the two countries . 
  the borders around switzerland and norway are similar . 
  they are part of the schengen area , so there are n't systematic border checks . 
  but both are n't part of the eu customs union , and above certain limits all goods that enter or leave the eu customs union have to be declared . 
  so the importer can pay taxes ( always ) and duties ( if country of origin is outside the eea ) . 
  but there is n't a border barrier around switzerland . 
  and there are plenty of border crossings that are n't even manned . 
  you only have a [ sign ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/st._margrethen_-_switzerland_-_austria_\\ ( 15957725 \\ ) . jpg ) that tells you when the crossing is open and that you are only allowed to enter if you do n't require a visa and have the necessary papers , and if you do n't bring goods that have to be cleared . 
  but the eu customs union might want them . 
   who does it harm more if we end up in a new tariff environment ? 
  does it harm more those who sell more to the u.k. or the u.k. ? 
  interesting question . 
  in 2015 the uk exported services and goods worth 255 billion euro to countries in the eu . 
  the uk imported services and goods worth 336 billion euro from the eu . 
  if there was absolutely no trade at all , and we looked only at trade while ignoring all the effects that are caused down the line , the uk would lose 255 billion euro . 
  and the eu would lose 336 billion $ . 
  clear win for the uk . 
  but . 
  in 2015 the uk had a nominal gdp of 2575 billion euro . 
  so by losing the exports to the eu , they would lose around 10 % of their gdp . 
  in 2015 the eu-27 had a nominal gdp of 12060 billion euro . 
  so by losing the exports to the uk , they would lose around 2.8 % of their gdp . 
  so who does loss of trade harm more ? 
  the eu commission has made suggestions how germany could implement the toll without violating eu laws . 
  for example by lowering fuel tax . 
  or by increasing the commuters allowance . 
  but the transport ministry was not willing to compromise . 
  that 's why minister dobrindt sucks and needs to be dismantled . 
  not even the afd wants germany to leave the eu . 
  to find one that wants to leave the eu you have to go to the real fringe parties . 
   i 'm having a hard time to understand the british behavior because at this rate they are just going to infuriate what used to be their closest ( on geography ) allies and their most important business partners . 
   it 's weird . 
  i believe they would have had a much much better chance of getting a favorable deal if they would have invoked article 50 soon after the referendum . 
  and then have worked together with the eu to get a deal that is acceptable for everyone involved . 
  and by keeping good relations without stupid `` uk stronk . 
  uk buys italian prosecco and german cars . 
  so uk demands '' posturing they could have easily get that unanimous vote from the eu-27 to prolong the negotiation past the initial 2 year limit . 
  but all that `` it 's not a eu matter . 
  we alone decide when we invoke a50 . 
  we have to find the best negotiators so we can get the most favorable deal for britain '' posturing has destroyed a lot . 
  under current circumstances i doubt that they would manage to convince all 27 members to vote for prolongation . 
  and that bullshit about announcing vetos for things that wo n't be their business 2 years after a50 was invoked wo n't help them either . 
  for some reason they do n't want to realize they are the junior partner in eu-uk negotiations . 
  the eu wo n't be bullied into submission . 
  all that posturing can only have negative effects on the outcome of the negotiations . 
   but at least it would have been a way to generate more money that is desperately needed . 
  we have a 18.5 billion euro budget surplus . 
  according to the optimistic forecast of dobrindt , the road toll for foreigners was supposed to bring in a net of 500 million euro per year .
