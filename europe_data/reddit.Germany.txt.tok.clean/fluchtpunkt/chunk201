  or just empty words ? 
  the difference is that the ones in refugee camps in the middle east are n't able to leave . 
  many just ca n't afford the trip . 
  nobody stays in these camps voluntarily . 
  people in these camps are n't more humble . 
  they are n't happy with the little perspective these camps offer . 
  they just are n't able to leave . 
  every compromise will be a loss for the eu . 
  because the eu wants to keep the current single market freedoms . 
  and every compromise will be a gain for the uk . 
  because the uk wants to limit the current single market freedoms . 
  either the eu gives up demands , or the uk gives up demands . 
  or both give up demands . 
  there 's no compromise that will benefit both . 
  of course there might be a compromise where both suffer only as little as possible . 
  but from a eu perspective that 's not something i would call beneficial . 
  eu citizens would literally lose a right they currently have . 
  in some sectors of the brexit discussion it 's pretty much a case of either or . 
  if the uk gets single market participation without freedom of movement , they 'll win big time . 
  and the eu loses . 
  if the uk does n't get single market participation without freedom of movement , they 'll lose . 
  and the eu loses . 
  and because of that unfortunate situation for the eu , brits believe that they have a right to single market participation . 
  because then at least one party wins . 
  what do you want to tell us ? 
  barristers do n't work in starbucks , these are barista . 
   there are n't 25 countries that want to make brexit hard in the first place . 
  1 country is enough . 
  and eastern europe in particular does n't seem too fond of the idea to allow the uk access to the single market without freedom of movement . 
   depends , pretty sure london is eagerly awaiting the swiss question . 
   it could set a precedent . 
  and switzerland was hoping that brexit would be that precedent . 
  the swiss question will be solved by another referendum . 
  the eu wo n't cave in . 
   but gunnar beck argues that germany 's negotiating position is weaker than most people realise [ ... ] italy , too , is in no position to put its exports at risk . 
  just 25 more countries that can prevent a deal that favors the uk . 
   on 17 august michael roth , germany 's minister of european affairs said : `` given britain 's size , significance , and its long membership of the european union , there will probably be a special status which only bears limited comparison to that of countries that have never belonged to the european union . '' and on 2 september [ he said ] ( http://www.stern.de/news/roth-lehnt--rosinenpickerei--durch-grossbritannien-ab-7038386.html ) :  `` wer weiter von den grundfreiheiten der eu profitieren m\u00f6chte , der kann nicht nur die grundfreiheiten f\u00fcr kapital , dienstleistungen und g\u00fcter in anspruch nehmen , sondern dazu geh\u00f6rt nat\u00fcrlich auch die arbeitnehmerfreiz\u00fcgigkeit ''  who wants to continue to profit from the eu basic freedoms , can not solely make use of freedom of capital , service and goods , but of course has to include freedom of movement for workers . 
  for some reason that interview was way less reported in international news . 
  -- mark my words : there wo n't be full single market participation if the uk does n't grant full freedom of movement for workers . 
  better than 0.015 %, 
  they could get immigrants from central asia right now . 
  immigration policy continues to be the sole responsibility of member countries . 
  nobody is stopping them . 
  hungary just has to grant them work permits . 
  that number of the 54 refugees who found work , that was reported a while ago , was actually solely about the 30 german companies that are listed in the dax . 
  according to the following news report 12000 refugees found work in germany ( if you believe the headline ) or even bavaria alone ( if you believe the article ) . 
   68 were employed by local companies ... as full time employees by the 30 companies that are listed in the dax . 
  a couple hundred work in apprenticeships and internships in these dax businesses . 
  12000 refugees work in german businesses that are n't listed in the dax . 
  i 'm not sure if that number is only for bavaria as the article suggest , or if it 's about germany as the headline suggests . 
  so i 'm going with the more conservative number . 
  i demand a `` slightly misleading '' tag !, 
   so it appears that more citizens with immigration background are in the area less percentage does the anti-immigration party reaches , which only makes sense . 
  to make sense of that outside of the `` fear of the unknown '' , people with migration background must be much more likely to vote than people without migration background . 
  on that day we 'll all be euphoric . 
  someone has a different opinion ? 
  must be a messed up soviet in disguise . 
  not yet . 
  preliminary headquarters in brussels , and once the eu army is ready we invade switzerland . 
  i added the former border , so you do n't have to . 
   yep welcome to / r/europe `` we are better than worldnews because we 're not racist and stuff '' . 
  we just dislike foreigners . 
  but that 's not a race . 
  neither germany nor sweden have non-schengen borders that were significant in the refugee crisis . 
  neither germany nor sweden have changed their stance on the right to asylum , yet the flow of asylum seekers via the balkan route has drought up almost completely . 
  amazing , is n't it ? 
  i showed these numbers to argue against the 7 year restrictions that were put in place . 
  in that case poles that moved to germany are the only relevant statistics . 
  people like to believe that the uk let in every pole while germany did n't let in anyone . 
  which was clearly not the case . 
   berlin is as metropolitan place as you will find in germany today . 
  that 's why left get as many votes as they do there . 
  berlin is in east germany . 
  that 's why the left gets as many votes as they do there . 
  the left received better results than in berlin ( i use the 15.7 % prognosis ) during state elections in saxony-anhalt ( 2016 , 16.3 % ) , thuringia ( 2014 , 28.2 % ) , saxony ( 2014 , 18.9 % ) , brandenburg ( 2014 , 18.6 % ) and saarland ( 2012 , 16.1 % ) . 
  in the recent elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania they got 13.2 % of the votes . 
  it very likely was . 
  either the numbers the bbc uses are questionable , or the german migration report is wrong . 
  according to the bbc :  while britain is still home to more polish expatriates than any other european country , germany has become more of a lure , with about 41,000 moving there in 2015 . 
  according to our 2015 freedom of [ movement report ( pdf , german ) ] ( https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/broschueren/freizuegigkeitsmonitoring-jahresbericht-2015.pdf;jsessionid=3690a30f8f4e07ada1339bcea325541e.1_cid286?__blob=publicationfile ) , 147,910 poles moved to germany . 
  70,740 poles left germany . 
  hence 77,170 net migration . 
   why are so many young people leaving poland these days ? 
  because they can earn more money in western europe . 
   nothing surprising here . 
  had uk also extended 7 year labour restrictions back than in 2004 total number of poles there would be signifficantly lower , or the same had germany let poles working there without restrictions already in 2004 total number of poles in uk/germany would be quite different . 
  `` restrictions '' . 
  germany basically granted a work permit to every pole who asked kindly . 
  here is the number of poles that migrated to germany - 1992 : 131,780 - 1993 : 75,195 - 1994 : 78,745 - 1995 : 87,305 - 1996 : 77,545 - 1997 : 71,322 - 1998 : 66,263 - 1999 : 72,402 - 2000 : 74,256 - 2001 : 79,033 - 2002 : 81,551 - 2003 : 88,241 - 2004 : 125,042 -- poland joined the eu - 2005 : 147,716 - 2006 : 152,733 - 2007 : 140,870 - 2008 : 119,876 - 2009 : 112,027 - 2010 : 115,587 - 2011 : 165,705 -- full freedom of movement between germany and poland - 2012 : 177,758 - 2013 : 190,424 - 2014 : 192,172 source : migrationsbericht 2014 , table 1-10 , page 179 [ ( german , pdf ) ] ( https://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2016/migrationsbericht_2014_de.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  should n't they call it schweigepresse then ? 
  at the last berlin senate elections the pirate party grew from 0 to 8.9 % . 
  and now they shrank to 1.5 %, 
  5 years ago people told us we have to get used to the pirate party ( 8.9 % in the last berlin senate election ) . 
  you at least have to post the video of the `` translation '' that bends his words to `` we should kill all germans '' . 
   1 ) attacking private property is a lot more threatening than attacking public property because of the fact that you 're singling out a person rather than a policy and the potential victims of the fire in a public building are collateral damage . 
  yes . 
  i chose three years because by then the uk has hopefully left the eu . 
   the uk suggesting they will veto an eu `` defence union '' whilst they are members could be an attempt to force the eu to move quicker on a new uk/eu deal . 
  move quicker ? 
  it 's not the eu that stops the uk from triggering article 50 to start the negotiations .
