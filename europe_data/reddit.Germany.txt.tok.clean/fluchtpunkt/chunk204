  to play farage 's advocate : the murder of a polish man in essex is what happens if the uk does n't control immigration properly . 
  they probably quote it because the court ruled that it 's a violation . 
  british media always use a strange style when using quotation marks . 
  they often quote a few words or even single words mid-sentence without explicitly mentioning who was quoted . 
  quite different from what we have in german media . 
  at least that 's my conclusion after reading many british articles . 
  see other headlines of the independent :  man ` killed by porsche driver ' after hit-and-run in london  teenager drugged and raped by her own father ` every day ' for two years  donald trump 's ` impossible ' tax plan  ` easy ' water birth video stuns internet with 16m views  dolphins capable of ` highly developed spoken language '  gorillas are now all critically endangered amid ` extinction crisis ' those are n't scare quotes to mark irony , disagreement with the choice of words , or non-standard use of words . 
  we could increase the eu budget so we can spend # 350m a week on the eu bookstore to make it great again . 
  that love to talk about the shared history of the commonwealth , while ignoring 49 of the 53 member states of the commonwealth , among them the 4 most populous members . 
   james skinner is the founder and executive director of the commonwealth freedom of movement organisation , an international organisation advocating the free movement of citizens between the united kingdom , australia , new zealand and canada . 
  good old whitecommonwealthists . 
  then opt-out . 
  done . 
  if the decision is so crystal-clear for you i do n't understand the problem . 
   i do n't know about the netherlands , but in germany at least you have to register yourself regardless . 
  we do n't even have a register for organ donations . 
  you can opt-out on the organ donors card . 
  if you do n't document your choice anywhere , your dependents have to decide in your name . 
   then the documents are either too complicated or people do not put in the effort to understand them . 
  adults should be able to understand this paperwork and if they do n't they can always ask for help . 
  there 's a lot more than understanding the paperwork . 
  in ethics classes we spend like 6 weeks \u00e1 90 minutes to discuss organ donations . 
   my next of kin know that in principle i 'm ok with donation but want to offer them the possibility to decide not to do it if for any reason they would feel bad about it at that point . 
  so you told them what you want , but then you left them with a ostensible choice . 
  if they decide against organ donation they will sooner or later have doubts about their choice because it was actually against your will . 
  so they will probably decide for organ donation . 
  which sucks for them if they are actually against donations , because after you have made them responsible for choosing they have to ignore their own opinion . 
  they would have much less ethical problems if you would just decide yourself and document that somewhere . 
  because they then do n't have to make a decision at all . 
  -- i know , i know , you talked to them and they are okay with making that decision . 
  ( because they do n't yet realize with what you have burdened them . ), 
  and russia has cited health concerns for similar bans in the past . 
   - the government requires you to register , taking away the choice not to choose . 
  where `` choice not to choose '' means that your dependents will have to choose for you . 
  which is always great , because while coping with your death , your parents , children or siblings also have to figure out how you would have decided . 
  which can be quite hard because if you make use of the choice to not choose , there 's a good chance that you 've never talked about that with your family . 
  otherwise you would have probably figured out that it makes a lot of sense to document your own choice . 
  what health concerns did they ~ ~ make up ~ ~ find this time ? 
  did they figure out that excessive consumption of salt is connected to heart problems ? 
  that has nothing to do with schengen though . 
  people who are n't eligible for schengen visa who pay a little extra fee to the romanian/bulgarian border official so they get a schengen visa . 
  the countries that oppose schengen membership of romania bulgaria have stated plenty of times that this is about corruption . 
  he said northern europe though . 
  replace `` money stolen '' with `` money taken away '' and you have an interesting analogy . 
  once you have died , you no longer own your money . 
  and you ca n't opt-out from that . 
  if she could have named a valid reason why she rejected someone for wearing a `` scarf covering her head '' , the court would have ruled in her favor . 
   romania has met the criteria to join schengen for a while now as gerd leers has said , `` you can have a door locked and fitted with the latest systems , but if the guard is not trustworthy , it 's no use . '', 
   how come a business can not refuse a client ? 
  they can . 
  if they have a valid reason that has to do with the business . 
   it 's not discrimination , it 's a business . 
  it 's discrimination if you reject a client because of their religion . 
   why are n't homeless people accepted in restaurants , even if they might have the money ? 
  i guarantee you that a groomed , freshly showered homeless guy in a clean suit will get served in every restaurant ( that is open to the public ) on this planet . 
   why not refuse people with very poor hygiene in your hair saloon ( might not be the case here , just exemplifying ) ? 
  that would be okay . 
  but she was not refused because of bad hygiene . 
  she was refused because she is muslim . 
   as a business owner , i think i have the right to choose to whom i offer my services . 
  you can . 
  just not based on reasons that have nothing to do with your business . 
  at least not in the eu . 
  and not in many other civilized countries . 
   if i run a bar and some hobo comes up to order a drink , stinking up my place and might be bothering other customers , but he has the money , what am i supposed to do ? 
  do n't let him in because he is stinking up your place and because he might bother other customers . 
  that 's not discrimination . 
  that 's a reason to reject customers that has to do with your business . 
  because it would make the experience for your other customers unpleasant or even dangerous . 
  the eu has stopped being about shared values over a decade ago . 
  eastern europe was n't added because they share our values . 
  they were added because we could get some economic growth from them . 
   all trade will continue as is without any limitations . 
  except for that tiny limitation named customs . 
  you ca n't afford to travel anyway . 
  does n't matter . 
  you were part of the invasion . 
  if you would have had more useful units you would have send more . 
  poland was one of the four countries that invaded iraq in 2003 . 
  it 's not the employed bankers who decide where the bank moves , 
   vacation and being somewhere ` safe to reside ' are two completely different things in the eyes of the law ... generally not . 
  traveling to your home country is a strong reason to make your refugee status void . 
  as in all cases that 's decided on a case by case basis . 
  the problem is , as the article mentions , that the asylum agency does n't know . 
  they do n't have access to travel data . 
   can you think of any counterexamples ? 
   [ rassenschande ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rassenschande ) , [ untermensch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/untermensch ), 
  i 've read the article for you . 
  yes , everyone who is n't a citizen of a eu or schengen country would have to pay . 
   on saturday , the guardian reported that as part of draft european commission legislation for a ** proposed eu travel information and authorisation system ** , france and germany have backed a system based on the us esta scheme . 
  under the american system , visitors from countries that do not require full visas are required to apply online for permission to travel at a cost of $ 14 ( # 11 ) . 
    ** such a scheme , if imposed ** , could end up applying to travellers from a uk no longer in the eu , legal experts said . 
  50 $ that she 'll continue to be chancellor . 
  are you in ? 
  you qualify for refugee if your life is endangered in your home country . 
  there are just two options if you return voluntarily , your life is no longer endangered , or you are suicidal . 
  the former should get your refugee status taken away , the latter should get you admitted to a hospital . 
  reject them at the border and put them on a return flight . 
   edit : apparently the examples i cited were covered in other media . 
  obviously .
