  even christians from the middle east do n't fit the description of being from `` our western , christian culture '' . 
   in the future , priority must be given to immigrants from our western , christian culture the original :  `` in zukunft muss gelten : vorrang f\u00fcr zuwanderer aus unserem christlich-abendl\u00e4ndischen kulturkreis '', 
  the opposite of being part of the common market is n't a trade blockade . 
  it 's just a matter of time until facebook will poach that european startup for 15 billion us-dollar . 
  fun fact : there is already an agreement in place about names like champagne . 
  the use of such descriptions on labels in the us is already restricted . 
  only producers that used `` champagne '' on their labels before march 2006 are allowed to continue to use that designation . 
  that 's certainly not the reason why the ttip negotiations have stalled . 
   ### [ agreement between the european community and the united states of america on trade in wine ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/all/?uri=celex:22006a0324\\ ( 01 \\ ) )   article 6   use of certain terms on wine labels with respect to wines sold in the united states   1 . 
  with respect to wine that is sold in the territory of the united states , the united states shall seek to change the legal status of the terms in annex ii to restrict the use of the terms on wine labels solely to wine originating in the community . 
  labels for such wines may use the terms in annex ii in a manner consistent with the us wine labelling regulations in force as of 14 september 2005 . 
  paragraph 1 shall not apply with respect to any person or its successor in interest using a term listed in annex ii on a label of a wine not originating in the community , where such use has occurred in the united states before 13 december 2005 , or the date of signature of this agreement , whichever is later ; provided that the term may only be used on labels for wine bearing the brand name , or the brand name and the fanciful name , if any , for which the applicable cola was issued prior to the later date referred to in this paragraph and the term is presented on the label in accordance with the regulations in effect on 14 september 2005 . 
  annex ii contains burgundy , chablis , champagne , chianti , claret , haut sauterne , hock , madeira , malaga , marsala , moselle , port , retsina , rhine , sauterne , sherry and tokay . 
  the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the us department of the treasury already defines scotch whisky as :  unblended whisky ** manufactured in scotland ** in compliance with the laws of the united kingdom why do i know this ? 
  because 2 hours ago i wanted to write a witty comment about the uk losing the protected designation of origin for scotch . 
   the sun 's political editor , tom newton dunn , tweeted `` hard to think of a more anti-british figure , declaration of war . '' that sentiment was echoed by tom shipman of the sunday times , who tweeted `` appointing michel barnier , one of the least popular ex-commissioners in london , as point man for brexit is an act of war by juncker . '' now may can show if she really does n't hesitate to nuke the enemies of the uk . 
  he who laughs last , laughs loudest . 
  they could delay invoking article 50 until all these guys are dead . 
   would countries like greece be willing to lease uninhabited islands for the accommodation of refugees to the eu ( not a sarcastic question , i genuinely have no idea ) ? 
  i wonder when you proponents of the australian solution will realize that the center of the australian solution are n't islands but countries that are n't australia . 
  using islands that are part of the eu defeats the purpose of the australian solution . 
  because even on these uninhabited islands , the asylum seekers will be covered by eu law . 
  which means that all the people that are actual refugees have a right to not be detained in a camp on a uninhabited island . 
  people who got refugee rights would have a right to live in greece . 
  the deal between eu and turkey is as close as the eu will get to the australian solution . 
  the difference to the australian solution is that turkey is not as weak as papua new guinea , so the eu ca n't bully turkey into submission like australia did with png . 
  so the eu had to make more concessions . 
  germany has just announced that it will increase it 's defense budget by 1.7 billion euro in 2017 . 
  that increase is about three times the lithuanian military budget . 
   sure , tell that to the . net application you used . net ? 
  why did n't you develop your own framework . 
  could have saved even more . 
  she can say a lot of things . 
  but the judge wo n't believe her . 
   the simple fact is that the referendum was n't legally binding and it is not up to the eu to decide when the talks start . 
  and it 's not up to the uk to decide how the talks go . 
  if the uk alienates the eu by delaying the invocation of article 50 , the eu might reciprocate that during the article 50 talks . 
  and do n't forget that eu in that case could mean just 1 of 27 members . 
  they want to ban certain guns that are already banned in germany . 
   they want to put semi automatic guns into a category that would effectively them . 
  they want to put semi automatic guns that have been converted into fully automatic guns into that category . 
  and semi automatic guns that are capable of firing more than 21 rounds without reloading . 
  and semi automatic guns that have a folding stock . 
   but now reddit publishes these links and could be held responsible ... 
  please read at least the [ press release ] ( http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-09/cp160092en.pdf ) of the coj . 
   the posting of a hyperlink on a website to works protected by copyright and published without the author 's consent on another website does not constitute a ` communication to the public ' ** when the person who posts that link ** does not seek financial gain and acts without knowledge that those works have been published illegally if the case was reddit v. sanoma the court would have ruled different . 
  because reddit ca n't check the millions of links users create each day . 
  a totally different case from a gossip website where an editor post links to photos , and after the original photos have been deleted , changes the link to a different site . 
  since most of the content of \\ / r/pics is uploaded to imagehosters by the individual posters those have always infringed the rights of the copyright holders . 
  the eu court has judged about linking to photos that were uploaded by someone else . 
  in that case the link made the content available for the public , and therefor the link itself can infringe copyright . 
  if the entity that posted the link knew about the copyright infringing nature of the content , and if it 's done for profit . 
  the latter should exclude \\ / r/pics users . 
  however , courts might interpret the current ruling as an obligation for reddit to check each link . 
   including banning semi-auto firearms any neutral source for this ? 
  german law would n't change that much with the new gun directive . 
  it 's already pretty restrictive . 
  indeed . 
  germans who were n't jews , gypsies or homosexuals could easily get firearms . 
  the nazis even abolished the license requirement to own long guns and ammunition . 
  they also allowed more people ( inside the nsdap ) to carry arms in public without a permit . 
  i doubt that many would struggle with inserting a dvd and pressing next a couple of times . 
   peanuts literally 1.5 billion euro more than germany 's 2016 defense budget . 
  so you 're saying large economies have larger absolute vat gaps ? 
  who would have thought . 
  here 's a chart that shows the vat gap as a percentage of vat total tax liability : http://i.imgur.com/sljnjjw.png source : https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/2016-09_vat-gap-report_final.pdf, 
  phase 4 happens after phase 3 . 
  in phase 4 there wo n't be any waffenscheine because there wo n't be a weapons law . 
  and everyone has the constitutional right to bear arms . 
  my translation :  phase 4 : the right to posses and carry arms   inclusion of the right to bear arms in the basic law ; complete abolishment of the weapons law , because misuse of weapons and related offenses are regulated by the criminal code https://german-rifle-association.de/forderungen/, 
  thank you for your service , / u/executivemonkey, 
  we could finally call the czech republic eastern europe again !, 
  it 's time to bring back the old punishments for horse theft . 
  an eu army would be an actual army . 
  not several armies in a defense alliance . 
  latvia might want some of that estonian potato . 
   seriously , can you paint me the absurd scenario where a country in eu would be attacked and it wouldn \u00b4 t affect poland ? 
  - turkey invades the southern part of cyprus - morocco invades ceuta - brazil invades french guiana - argentina invades the falkland islands, 
  it 's like nato article 5 which does n't require countries to respond with military force either . 
  because the swiss have always been capable and willing to defend their neutrality . 
  very easily ? 
  last year when the eu suggested that frontex will help to secure the outer borders a couple member states were complaining because that results in the loss of sovereignty . 
  in greece people were up in arms because this would be another coup attempt by the euroreich . 
  and the eu was just talking about additional officers . 
  not about replacing national border guards with eu units . 
  private window / incognito mode / porn mode, 
  great color scheme . 
  there 's more difference in shade of green between 100 % and 100 % than there is between 80 % and 20 % . 
  and then there 's spain ... -- edit : i think i get it now . 
  the map does n't show how much of your wage you get while being sick . 
  it shows the absolute amount of money you get while being sick . 
  in other words , totally pointless . 
  euractiv and their `` source '' seem to be the only ones who talk about a fee . 
  i 'm not convinced . 
  the ( allegedly ) proposed fee , as well as esta , has to be paid by travelers who do n't need a visa . 
  people who need visa already pay visa fees . 
   they 're rejecting everything that is n't stricly related to free trade and the economy , which is what they signed up for . 
  then they have signed up for the wrong club . 
  leave the eu and join eea , and the eu customs union . 
   from a logistics standpoint a standardization of weapons , fuel , procedures would make a huge difference .
