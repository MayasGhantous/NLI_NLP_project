  which means that they 'll take less risk and will favor traditional businesses over `` uber for dogs '' . 
  such grants almost always depend on the proposal of viable a business plan . 
  which includes a three year profitability preview . 
  that alone is a pretty high obstacle for fraud . 
  they will also very likely require proof of previous work . 
   ( besides a ton of other reasons ) we finally get our papua new guinea so we can implement the australian solution . 
   10\u00a0000\u00a0000 divided by 0.00005 is 200\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 math is hard :d, 
  i own a company in germany . 
  our products are only sold outside of germany . 
  50 % of our revenue originates from sales in france , 50 % from sales in the uk . 
  according to your model france and the uk would each get taxes on 50 % of my total `` revenue '' . 
  how can i deduct the costs ( e.g. 
  salaries , rent , raw materials ) i have in germany from that ? 
  do i sum up my costs and deduct 50 % in each country ? 
  or can i deduct more costs in france because i have to hire translators ? 
  and why should germany agree to get zero taxes from my company ? 
  or just bring an assortment of vegetables and fruits . 
  oranges make a great replacement for a mandatory safety vest if you fix them to your chest and back . 
  put a green apple on your dashboard if you do n't have a sticker for the umweltzone . 
  a couple juicy watermelons can replace fire extinguishers . 
  of course . 
  otherwise you brits could get away with [ crashing into our gardens ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f4sivhl.jpg ) and [ crushing our teenage girls cars ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tx9jm9g.jpg ) ( no one harmed , license plate blacked out for privacy reasons ) too easily . 
  but brits do n't use the euro . 
   even the number of regions does not make sense , since they show administrative regions , but the administrative region i live in ( hessen ) is split in half by the color scheme . 
  in germany the map shows regierungsbezirke . 
  hessen has three of them . 
  the ec has more information , including methodology : http://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/facts-figures/regional_en, 
  they wo n't get any help outside of their assigned country . 
  problem solved . 
  please do n't bring freedom . 
   they have so loose rules for license plates in florida they do n't require license plates in the front . 
  so you can put whatever you want . 
  ( except other official us license plates , if i had to guess ), 
   by the end of this parliament does n't this mean until the next general elections , i.e. 
  if you ignore the raf . 
   yeah , i guess they just took the nearest working number plate from any car to maybe distinguish the tanks from each other . 
  more like a joke from the ukrainian man who moved a truck from germany to ukraine on a temporary license plate in 2011 . 
  ( that 's actually the confirmed origin of the license plate ) in florida i regularly saw cars with german license plates on the front . 
  a lot of bmw 's with munich plates in particular . 
   how many foreign products do you use on a regular basis ? 
  dozens . 
  my coffee is dutch . 
  shampoo , shaving stuff is from procter & gamble ( usa ) . 
  my deodorant is from p&g , but now belongs to coty inc. ( usa ) . 
  my bodywash sometimes comes from unilever ( nl/uk ) . 
  i drink coca cola products . 
  i eat butter from ireland , olive oil from greece , pasta from italy , ketchup from the us . 
  a lot of the stuff i eat belongs to nestl\u00e9 . 
  my energy drinks are from austria . 
  my laundry detergent is from p&g ( us ) . 
  my mouthwash from johnson & johnson ( us ) , toothpaste from colgate-palmolive ( us ) . 
  catfood from mars ( us ) . 
  various house cleaning products are made by us and uk companies . 
  parts of my furniture are from sweden . 
  my tv pretends to be from the netherlands but is actually from hong kong . 
  my monitors are from south korea and taiwan . 
  computer and mobile phone from the us . 
  printer from japan . 
  even my fucking beer now belongs to belgium . 
  i could continue for a while . 
  my home would be pretty empty if every foreign product disappeared . 
  am i being detained ? 
  someone went to romania and brought one home as a souvenir . 
  not that uncommon . 
  good old bild `` reporting '' . 
   today at frankfurt airport a passenger entered the security area before the security check had been completed . 
  1/1 https://twitter.com/airport_fra/status/770906594955624448  therefore the german federal police cleared departure hall a as a preventative measure.passengers will be rechecked prior to departure .2 / 2 https://twitter.com/airport_fra/status/770906934149058560, 
   20000 by the end of the year . 
  by the end of the year 2020 , according to gov.uk  he also spoke about the uk 's approach to resettlement and ongoing work with the unhcr to resettle 20,000 vulnerable syrian refugees by 2020 . https://www.gov.uk/government/news/minister-highlights-uk-commitment-to-syrian-resettlement, 
  welcome to the [ club ] ( http://i.imgur.com/de5hhce.jpg ), 
   cameron was also right in his approach , which was to take refugees only from the camps on-site , because that way - and only that way - can you actually vet them properly as well as select those with the highest chance of integration . 
   [ ... ]  and cameron was isolated in europe almost every eu country participated in unhcr resettlement of syrians . 
  germany resettled more than 40,000 people from lebanese and jordan camps . 
  did n't stop anyone from entering germany on their own . 
  keeping them on a shelf to look intelligent . 
   you really want to get into it look at what they charge us for import taxes compared to what we charge them . 
  what specific goods do you have in mind ? 
   but i ca n't remember the last time i actually read through an entire book . 
  must have been around 1997 , in grade 7 . 
  back then i figured out that there are brochures that tell you everything the teacher wants to know about books we had to read . 
   \\ + some profit for each item they make so i can continue to route my profits to ireland ? 
  my company in germany sells the goods i produce for ( cost + 1 $ ) to my company in ireland . 
  my company in ireland sells these goods for ( cost + 100,000 $ ) to my company in the us . 
  the company in the us sells the products for ( cost + 1 $ ) to the customer . 
  i pay 20 % on the 1 $ profit i made in germany and 20 % on the 1 $ profit i made in the us . 
  in ireland i pay 0.005 % on the 100,000 $ profit . 
  -- the `` distribute profit taxes by point of sale '' scheme only works if you actually take worldwide profits into account . 
  in my case we have to come up with a distribution scheme for 100,002 $ profits that involves three countries . 
  germany will argue that most of the profit is created in germany , because without the business in germany there would n't be a product to sell . 
  the us will argue that most of the profit is created in the us , because without a customer i would n't be able to sell . 
  and ireland will complain because my business presence in ireland is no longer necessary . 
   taxes should be paid where the sale is physically made . 
  that 's what sales taxes are for . 
  in the eu physically sales always have been taxable at the location of the sale . 
  since last year sales of virtual goods are taxed in the customers country . 
  before that amazon , google , apple and many more sold virtual goods from luxembourg to profit from a lower sales tax . 
  paying sales tax by location is okay and common practice . 
  but distributing profit taxes by location of sale becomes a nightmare rather quickly . 
  the bureaucracy that is necessary to figure out how much profit was made in each country would be massive . 
  example : i hire people to build a product in germany .
