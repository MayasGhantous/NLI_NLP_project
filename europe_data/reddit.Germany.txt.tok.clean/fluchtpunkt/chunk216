  because other arguments get too complicated . 
  it 's either `` they force companies to hire the illiterate cleaning lady in their board of directors ! '', 
  or `` i want women quota for garbage collection service ! '' . 
  always has been and always will be . 
  it 's a great idea if you want cheap contracts . 
  it 's a shitty idea if you want new technologies in a country wide scale . 
  why should a company pay thousands of euro to lay a ftth connection to a house if a second provider can just rent that line so they can offer a cheaper contract to the customer because the second company does n't have any investment risks . 
  yeah . 
  we should totally let her get away with a criminal offense , just because others committed crimes that are somehow related to her offense . 
  in fact we should change the laws that only the protected un-critizable demographics can be charged with crimes . 
  nothing in regards to the incidents in cologne will change . 
  sexual assault stays sexual assault and rape stays rape . 
  groping without any violence at all was not covered by the current laws . 
  that will change . 
  but that has nothing to do with cologne , because these incidents involved violence . 
  in regards to the law , violence also covers things like blocking someones way , or threatening someone . 
  if the victim repulses , dodges ( even subconscious ) or fends off the attacker it 's considered sexual assault and covered by existing law . 
  the new law covers cases like `` accidentally '' touching someones ass in the subway while leaving the train . 
  specifically , he clicked on a link in the article . 
  you seem to believe that every country is a dictatorship where some leader decides what laws a country enacts . 
  that 's not the case in parliamentary republics like germany . 
  merkel ca n't do jackshit if the parliament decides to enact or not enact a law . 
  furthermore , merkel is the head of government , not even the head of state , she does n't even have a right to veto laws . 
  thank god . 
  so the cops did encourage sexual assault ? 
  and no , nothing is ignored . 
  ** a fucking isis flag ** that was painted with a pen on a piece of paper to be precise . 
  people that are paid off the books usually get paid by money that did n't enter the books . 
  everything else is easy to track down , at least in `` real '' companies that are n't sole-proprietors . 
   i wish more european countries would adopt uk model [ ... ] everything can be done in english . 
  truly astonishing . 
  only if poland is willing to host 450 million to 2.2 billion refugees . 
  the jews ? 
  so maybe arrest them , charge them with a crime and let a judge decide if they are guilty . 
  i know , i know , too expensive . 
  i 've just called sky news . 
  they 'll soon pick up the story about the unknown man who said `` fuck you '' to a german on the internet . 
   and i have zero doubt that there will be civil wars across france and germany any day now . 
  any day . 
  they can harm us . 
  they can kill us . 
  but how dare they come to our nude beaches and say nasty things !, 
  they crossed a red line here . 
  yes . 
  we have to take such incidents seriously . 
  they called them names and said nasty stuff . 
  that 's illegal !, 
  but no . 
  not even national news reports about it . 
  no live coverage from the crime scene . 
  and of course merkel did n't gave a press conference . 
  we have n't even coined a twitter hashtag !, 
  i at least expected a ard brennpunkt about a bunch of dudes who went to a nude beach to call people names . 
  everyone knows that the only weakness of a terrorist is his citizenship . 
  he wo n't dare to attack switzerland without having the proper citizenship . 
  germany does n't border non-schengen countries . 
  it ca n't have an open door policy because there are no doors at all . 
  blame someone else for letting asylum seekers enter the schengen zone . 
  finally the uk can leave schengen !, 
  since you mentioned schengen , take a look at the map of europe . 
  maybe you 'll notice something . 
  if you do n't take an airplane or a ship you ca n't enter the schengen-zone in germany . 
  somebody else allowed the asylum seekers to enter the schengen zone . 
   the bomber last week was supposed to be deported soon . 
  to bulgaria . 
  that has changed . 
  up until mid 2015 we complained that she changes her opinion based on polls . 
  since then we complain that she does n't change her opinion when we want it . 
  that was the joke . 
   its the americans ... which tell you in your own country `` speak english ! '', 
  when dont understand anything . 
   ** had this now more than atleast 5x in berlin **, 
   italy spends quite a little but the forces are deployed in various anti piracy missions , migration surveillance , and have major presence in iraq and lebanon . 
  basically like every western eu country . 
  we are all leeches that are part of multiple military missions . 
  that 's when you realize that arms manufacturers want to be paid in euro or dollar , and not in % of gdp . 
  you thought about the correct law . 
  the description of the group was public and violated laws against what people call hate speech , volksverhetzung . 
  i would n't call a 900 member facebook group private either . 
   raids can be completely polite in germany most are . 
  they do n't come with a sek team to take your smartphone and your computer because you are suspected of inciting hatred on facebook . 
  unless you have connections to violent groups or have been convicted of violent crimes . 
  and they wo n't even kick in your door . 
  they 'll politely ring the doorbell and tell you that they have a search warrant . 
   you 're arriving uninvited at 6am to prevent people from destroying evidence . 
  between 1st of april and 30th of september they are even allowed to raid you at 4am !, 
   remember nuremberg race laws . 
  in nazi germany people were convicted for things that were `` crimes in germany '' at the time . 
  murdering people was also illegal back then . 
  i guess we should get rid of that law as well . 
  remember kids , having similar laws like nazi germany means you are secret nazi . 
  even if the laws are used for a completely different purpose . 
  now we are soviet nazi germany . 
  also 1984 and brave new world . 
  a facebook group that had 900 members and a public description which violated laws . 
  to be precise . 
  so i looked it up . 
  that so called private facebook group had 900 members . 
  it was named `` anti refugee movement '' and it 's public description was `` war and economic flood our country . 
  they bring terror , fear , sorrow .
