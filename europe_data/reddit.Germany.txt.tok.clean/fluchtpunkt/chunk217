  they rape our women and endanger our children . 
  put an end to this ! '' . 
  the judge considered this volksverhetzung and the man was convinced to 10 months suspended sentence , she had to pay 1200 $ . 
  the rule of law . 
  they did n't came up with the idea of raiding the mosque a few of days ago . 
  the absolute values different currencies trade in are absolutely irrelevant . 
  it 's all about relative changes . 
  maybe i 'm mistaken , but when the euro was created it was n't set up with a 1:1 euro-dollar ratio . 
   well , let 's see if the terrorist supporters who recruited headhunters for isis will get sentences even remotely equal to those of that young german couple sentenced recently just for being too critical of immigration at a private ( ! ), 
  facebook channel . 
  what was their sentence ? 
  if it were n't for us you would all speak german !, 
  please enlighten us with the truth . 
   i do n't see what the uk offers in exchange for those demands . 
  maybe that is what makes it a new model . 
  according to translate.google.com '' \u0414\u0435\u0440\u044c\u043c\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0446\u0438\u044f '' means `` shit turkey '', 
  germany suspended the dublin regulations for syrians in late august 2015 . 
  ( reinstated in november ) the syrian in question requested asylum in germany in early 2014 , that was before august 2015 . 
  according to the [ police ] ( https://twitter.com/polby_1/status/758338725227143168 ) the suitcase contains burned clothes and the remains of a spray can . 
  no explosives .

   i honestly do n't care . 
  it does n't have to be the refugees themselves to do this . 
  if it happens thanks to them , they 're at fault . 
  their skirts where to short , they asked for it . 
  well he did n't mention refugees . 
  no amount of resources would allow greece to close its border . 
  land borders are relatively easy to protect . 
  build a fence and keep people from messing with it . 
  it 's much harder to keep people outside of your coastal borders if you have some morals left . 
  because if you have , you wo n't let people drown . 
  that 's why the turkey-eu deal is so important . 
  it allows greece to keep people out without letting them drown . 
  i get the feeling that some brits try to justify their decision to vote leave by claiming that the eu wants to punish them because deep inside the eu hates and has always hated the uk . 
  similar to how people often claim that their ex partner is the worst person on earth that always treated them badly after they have broke up with each other . 
  `` eu appoints former french minister for negotiation talks with britain '' just does n't have the same ring as `` eu appoints former french minister who really really hates us '', 
  only if isis claims responsibility . 
   meanwhile , ` france is france ' that 's what he said in jest . 
  the legal background is that the deadline for france does n't run out until 2017 . 
  that means the relevant data the eu commission will base their decision on will be submitted to the commission in april 2017 . 
  each year in april the participating countries provide debt and deficit data to the commission . 
  the deadline for spain runs out at the end of the year , so the eu commission had to act on the data they received in april . 
  and the deadline for portugal ran out at the end of 2015 already . 
   and together with germany can break the deficit limit for decades before the crisis and nothing happened . 
  the stability and growth pact was reformed in 2011 . 
  the eu member states agreed to procedures that automatically impose penalties if countries breach the deficit or debt rules . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation  one of the principal aims of the dublin regulation is to prevent an applicant from submitting applications in multiple member states . 
  another aim is to reduce the number of `` orbiting '' asylum seekers , who are shuttled from member state to member state . 
  ** the country that the asylum seeker first applies for asylum is responsible for either accepting or rejecting asylum ** , and the seeker may not restart the process in another jurisdiction . 
  wilhelm , von gottes gnaden deutscher kaiser , k\u00f6nig von preu\u00dfen , that leftist regressive asshole decided that everyone who has german citizenship is a german . 
  how many of them have received asylum ? 
   we can finance refugee camps and create safe zones . 
  but we do n't . 
  we do n't even pay the 1.6 billion us$ that are required to close the funding gap of the existing unhcr refugee response in regards to syria . 
  the truth is that people do n't give a single fuck about refugees , until they step on their front porch . 
   go ahead and house some asylum seekers , or donate money , food , clothes yourself . 
  and if you want to have safe zones go ahead , book a flight to syria , and create them yourself . 
   following the council decision , the commission recommends to cancel fines and to set new fiscal paths for spain and portugal http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-16-2625_en.htm stupid eu wants to see portugal and spain dead !!, 
  ! 111 vote out now !, 
   following the council decision of 12 july 2016 that spain and portugal did not take effective action to correct their excessive deficits , the commission today recommends a new fiscal adjustment path for both countries . 
  ** the college of commissioners also recommends that the fine be cancelled for both countries ** , a recommendation which the council will need to approve , amend or reject . 
  the council is not bound by the commission recommendation but can increase the fine to up to 0.2 % of gdp under eu rules . 
  the french deadline does n't run out in 2015 ( portugal ) or 2016 ( spain ) . 
  france has one more year . 
  of course the commission can be more lax in this case . 
  if they prefer working as slaves in western europe over working in hungary , i do n't want to know about the working conditions there . 
  lebanon asked the un for 1.9 billion us - $ for hosting refugees in 2016 . 
  up until 10 jun 2016 lebanon received 519.5 million us - $ from un countries . 
  that 's 27 % of the required funding . 
  jordan asked for 1.1 billion us - $ , it has received 316.3 million . 
  turkey has asked for 843 million and it has received 294 million . 
  -- and now you say `` but the year is n't over , they 'll pay '' . 
  here 's the breakdown for the year 2015 . 
  - egypt asked for $ 190m , received $ 58m - iraq asked for $ 426m , received $ 178m - jordan asked for $ 1,191 m , received $ 744m - lebanon asked for $ 1,761 m , received $ 1,106 m - turkey asked for $ 624m , received $ 286m if i were the leader of any eu country i would be deeply ashamed of that . 
  the eu countries could have paid that 1.6 billion unhcr funding gap pretty easily . 
  but the sad truth is that nobody in the eu gives a flying fuck about refugees until they step foot into our countries . 
  -- http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php, 
   they 've neighbours as well . 
  jordan ( gdp 33.7 billion us-dollar , less than lithuania ) currently hosts 660,000 refugees from syria . 
  lebanon ( gdp 44.4 billion $ , less than lithuania ) host 1,033,000 . 
  turkey ( gdp 822 billion $ , less than the netherlands ) a whopping 2,733,000 . 
  and then comes the eu ( 16,220 billion $ ) , the largest economy in the world , and says `` you are n't doing enough , we are full '' . 
   but what if he tries to block the movement of nuclear weapons out of turkey ? 
  one of the nuclear weapons might explode . 
  i doubt that turkey would start a war with the us . 
  and that 's the worst case scenario that would happen if turkey decides to stop the us from taking its weapons home . 
  because italy actually manages to provide for asylum seekers in a way that is compatible with human rights . 
  start to treat asylum seekers like shit and the human rights court will tell austria that they ca n't send people back to italy . 
  basically every eu country has done resettlement of syrians from un refugee camps . 
  even the uk itself participated with 216 syrians in 2013 . 
  germany has resettled more than 40,000 syrians back then . 
  20,000 of these via private sponsorship visa . 
  even poland ( 900 ) and hungary ( 30 ) participated . 
  but asylum seeker still come to the eu . 
  do n't get smug because the uk pledged 20,000 resettlements over the course of 5 years . 
  it 's not resettlement that keeps asylum seekers out of the uk . 
  it 's the channel . 
  can you point out a few decisions that require unanimity , where the eu has ignored an official veto by a member state ? 
  so on how many of the ~ 30 eu free trade agreements that were signed after 1987 did ireland have a referendum ?
