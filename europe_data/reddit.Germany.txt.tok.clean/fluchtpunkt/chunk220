  but local , state and federal police ( which includes anti-terror units like bfe + and even gsg9 ) are more than capable of handling those . 
   germany restricted immigration for those countries for 7 years on paper . 
  to appease the electorate . 
  meanwhile the immigration agency rubber-stamped work permits . 
  here are the numbers of poles who moved to germany : - 1992 : 131,780 - 1993 : 75,195 - 1994 : 78,745 - 1995 : 87,305 - 1996 : 77,545 - 1997 : 71,322 - 1998 : 66,263 - 1999 : 72,402 - 2000 : 74,256 - 2001 : 79,033 - 2002 : 81,551 - 2003 : 88,241 - 2004 : 125,042 -- poland joined the eu - 2005 : 147,716 - 2006 : 152,733 - 2007 : 140,870 - 2008 : 119,876 - 2009 : 112,027 - 2010 : 115,587 - 2011 : 165,705 -- freedom of movement between germany and poland - 2012 : 177,758 - 2013 : 190,424 - 2014 : 192,172 source : migrationsbericht 2014 , table 1-10 , page 179 [ ( german , pdf ) ] ( https://www.bmi.bund.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/broschueren/2016/migrationsbericht_2014_de.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  that 's what the 5 % of gdp reverse-membership fees are for . 
  it makes sure that the eastern european countries do n't evolve into countries where asylum seekers want to step foot in . 
  because norway has adopted freedom of movement . 
  outlawing the production of face sitting videos , and the introduction of porn filters where you could opt-out was only the start . 
  who would have thought . 
  now they are coming for the porn consumers that have opted-out . 
  and in a couple of years they will just ban dangerous and unpleasurable sex practices . 
  did you follow the events last night ? 
  eyewitnesses reported a lot of things that did n't happen . 
  according to eyewitnesses there were shootings and hostage situations all over munich . 
  turns out the eyewitnesses were wrong . 
  eyewitnesses also said that there were 3 shooters who had rifles . 
  turns out there was one shooter , the other 2 alleged shooters were just bystanders who fled the scene with their car . 
  and the rifles ? 
  a handgun . 
  eyewitness reports are not very reliable and they certainly do n't become the truth just because they fit your agenda . 
  especially if there 's only a single eyewitness who has only spoken to cnn . 
  itt : what details do i have to leave out so nobody notices that i cheated ? 
   yes , but the minimum wage is n't a wage you can support a family on , in the uk then the uk should increase the minimum wage . 
   in construction there is a huge issue of eastern europeans working cash in hand for wages english labourers can compete even less with . 
  that 's illegal . 
  your local authorities should do something about this . 
   no , ` posted workers ' is what they call it , british companies can hire a pole or romanian in the uk while paying them their domestic wage under eu laws . 
  nope . 
  that 's not what a posted worker is . 
  a posted worker is someone who is send by their employer to carry out a service in a different eu country temporarily . 
  : a construction company from warsaw is contracted by a uk company to build a house in london . 
  the warsaw company sends its employees to london , these are posted workers . 
  that 's the british way to do politics . 
  outside of the uk not everybody resign once rough sea is ahead of them . 
  trigger article 50 , so all the disadvantaged eu members that are suffering under the euroreich can prosper again . 
  could have been anything . 
  eye witnesses from all over the city called the police to report shootings and hostage situations . 
  because the treaties germany and all other eu countries have ratified require that we accept ( the treaties call it protect ) asylum seekers until it can be ruled out that they are persecuted in their home country . 
  there 's also the un refugee resettlement program . 
  many eu countries participated and flew in asylum seekers from refugee camps . 
  many even continue to this day . 
  in fact , as part of the eu-turkey deal , germany constantly flies in syrian refugees from turkey . 
  but well meme 'd nonetheless . 
   confirmed he shouted allahu akbar while executing kids according to cnn , and only cnn, 
  munich police currently holds a press conference . 
  he was german-iranian though , i.e. 
  german passport, 
  i wonder how legit that ( now deleted/disabled ) facebook profile of that muslim girl was that tried to lure young turks to that mcdonalds . 
  standing nato maritime group 2 is patrolling the aegean sea to hunt down smugglers . 
  and eunavfor med is deployed to the mediterranean sea , though their primary objective is n't to arrest smugglers . 
  turkey also pledged to fight smugglers on turkish soil . 
  according to police , the perpetrator most likely acted alone , and he has killed himself . 
  https://twitter.com/polizeimuenchen/status/756631565631905794 https://twitter.com/polizeimuenchen/status/756631852207726592 there 'll be a press conference at 2 . 
  does `` seehofer '' ring a bell with you ? 
  he 's the minister president of bavaria . 
  he was one of the few who spoke up against merkel about her stance on refugees . 
  he 's the one that threatened to close the borders of bavaria if the federal government does n't get the situation under control . 
  why should he have an interest in whitewashing anything ? 
  and what would there be to whitewash ? 
  this whole thing is live on national tv . 
  well . 
  they have paid for it ( in actual us-dollars ) , so of course they believe they have that right . 
  unfortunately for them eu consumer rights protection does n't apply to people smuggling agreements that were made in turkey . 
  so what are the german authorities hiding ? 
  that there are hundreds of dead victims ? 
  that there are similar attacks in multiple german cities ? 
  have they already caught the perpetrator ( s ) but they hide them from public because they are asylum seekers ? 
  did they already know that the perpetrator ( s ) would kill people but they did n't act to not appear `` racis '' ? 
  what exactly are they hiding from the public ? 
  at least deliver a conspiracy theory . 
  that 's why i only trust anonymous reddit accounts . 
  please tell us the truth . 
   kassam haid is that the cousin of [ sam hyde ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/sam-hyde ) ? 
  because it sounds so similar or the brother of sum ting wong and ho lee fuk ? 
  pure luck . 
  until a week ago you would n't have heard about similar attacks happening in germany either . 
  source ? 
  while killing random people . 
  i actually had `` recent '' in there . 
  but it did n't look good . 
  or it was just 1 shooter . 
  as far as i know the number 3 came from eye-witnesses , not from surveillance cameras or something . 
  and just one confirmed shooting scene . 
  - poland : invaded iraq , no terror attack - uk : invaded iraq , no recent terror attack - france : did not invade iraq , terror attack - germany : did not invade iraq , terror attack wake up sheeple !, 
  ^ ^ / s ^ ^ obviously, 
  then \\ / r/europe has to step down . 
  what if the terrorist was one of the 200,000 people that were allowed into the schengen area by hungary before merkel invited everyone over ? 
  do n't forget tony blair and leszek miller . 
  that 's already the job of social media attention-seekers . 
   one of the terrorists was on trial recently . 
  still ongoing ( in munich ) . 
  beate zsch\u00e4pe , the only survivor from the 3 person group is on trial in case someone wants to read more : - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nsu_murders - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nsu_trial, 
  he has obviously no agenda , so it 's okay . 
  so the upper limit is 2 , like in columbine ? 
  the usual definition of terrorism requires an activity that appears to intimidate or coerce a civilian population . 
  or an act that appears to try to influence policy of a government by intimidation or coercion . 
  many countries also consider acts that affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction , assassination or kidnapping terrorism . 
   some people are willing to stir up some extra shit for some internet fame or to further their agenda . 
  which also keeps the police busy .
