  because there is a lack of liquefaction plants , lng carriers and on eu-side regasification terminals . 
  frontex does n't have a single law enforcement officer . 
  they only coordinate between border control agencies of member states . 
  similar to europol and other eu agencies that are not allowed to actual get things done because that would be an attack on the sovereignty of eu members . 
   german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier believes easing eu sanctions on russia -- ** provided it fulfils certain conditions ** -- is an important element in the hunt for a solution to the fighting in eastern ukraine . 
    `` we should be smart when it comes to dealing with these sanctions , '' he told foreign journalists in berlin on tuesday . 
  `` to me , ` smart ' means that if there is truly substantial progress -- ** and currently there is no such progress , yet ** -- we can consider easing sanctions , step-by-step . '' indeed ; that 's the point of these sanctions . 
  these sanctions do n't exist to punish russia for being russia , they exist to improve the situation in ukraine . 
  when talking about asylum , `` safe country of origin '' is a legal term . 
  the eu has defined the criteria in its asylum procedures directive , ensuring that : - the applicant 's life and liberty are not in danger on account of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ' ; - there is no risk of serious harm , in the meaning of the qualification directive ; - the principle of non-refoulement is respected ; - the prohibition of removal , in violation of the right to freedom from torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment as laid down in international law , is respected ; and - refugee status can be requested and those recognised as refugees receive protection in accordance with the geneva convention . 
  like many many countries , pakistan does n't meet these criteria . 
  you seem to care a lot about the appearance of others . 
  have you reported them to the police ? 
   if you come to live in europe , your religion needs to be as evident to me , as your taste in music . 
  if i do n't ask you about it personally , i do n't need you to put on a costume [ ... ] so band shirts should be banned too ? 
  so how many robberies ( or crimes in general ) could n't be solved because the perpetrator wore a niqab , burqa or similar ? 
   our growth rate is way better than the eu average , much better than belgium 's and in absolute values the romanian growth was almost as large as belgium 's . 
  almost . 
  businesses pay taxes on profits , not on revenue . 
  that 's where things in your proposed model get complicated . 
  i make 2000 $ revenue in france and 1000 $ revenue in germany , in which country do i account the 1500 $ expenses that i had in germany ? 
  neither . 
  greece just cares as much about the problems of eastern europe as eastern europe cares about the problems of greece . 
  staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeit : deutsch it 's part of both documents . 
  maybe they would n't have `` impure '' thoughts if the women would wear a burqa . 
   i 'm not sure if this is accurate . 
  afaik , they signed up for an economic union . 
  if that would be the case they would have joined efta and negotiated access to the eea . 
  like norway , switzerland , iceland and liechtenstein did . 
   if any other country was in our position ( sir complain-a-lot ) then they would also want out . 
  for example , germany has a higher net migration rate of eu citizens than the uk . 
  we just do n't complain about it , because we know how to build housing . 
  i bought a 500g pack of spanish strawberries in kaufland a couple minutes ago ; 1.59 $ . 
  so 3.18 $ per kilogram . 
  more important , germany has urged the involved countries to continue talks about south stream . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-gas-southstream-iduskbn0jt1ni20141215 it might be convenient to believe that germany has sabotaged the south stream project to get north stream ii , but it 's wrong . 
   but if you 're looking for someone who i assume is doing better on all this than the rest of europe , it 's probably norway . 
  bold conclusion considering that you have no idea what you are talking about and have n't even bothered to read the article . 
  almost every single eu country has been doing this for years . 
  the uk is late to the game . 
  fun fact : on a per capita base , greece got more than twice the money west germany received from the marshall plan . 
  even in 1950 greece was n't able to turn free cash into long term profit . 
   a country like sweden is so averse to war i believe it is capable of ignoring an article 5 posing a major problem to the alliance . 
  both finland and sweden were part of isaf , and both are part of resolute support . 
  vote to leave . 
  and everyone knows that merkel wants the uk out , so germany can finally pay even more money to the eu , while potentially losing a lot of trade . 
  thanks merkel !, 
   except it wont be an open attack , but more the little green men scenario and nato will spend a few years debating whether that constitutes an attack like nato did in the `` brown little men in planes '' scenario back in 2001 ? 
  and the last time article 5 was invoked shows that you do n't even need an invasion to unleash nato . 
   the attitudes in most nato countries are such that people do n't see any sense in their soldiers dying for baltic states ' freedom . 
  though these countries must love when their soldier die for the freedom of afghanistan . 
  if we consider the last time article 5 was invoked . 
  when talking about asylum `` safe country '' refers to countries that do n't prosecute their citizens for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion . 
  any stats on the effectiveness ? 
  switzerland ca n't control their legislation and immigration policies because they have that free trading agreement . 
  switzerland grants freedom of movement to workers from other eu countries . 
  if the uk wants to control immigration , i.e. 
  keep the eastern eu citizen out , they wo n't get access to the single market on the level switzerland has . 
  gema does n't care who performs a song , as long as the song is registered with gema , or as long as gema can assume that the artist would register the song with gema if he would know that gema exists . 
  if there 's a coldplay concert in germany , the event organizer has to pay gema fees for each and every coldplay song that coldplay has performed during that concert . 
  because people like song authors who are not or no longer part of the performing music group receive a part of the collected money from that performance as well . 
  gema has nothing to do with the reimbursement of rights holders for copyright violations . 
  gema exists to collect fees from businesses that earn money by playing music , that money will then be given to the people that have created the song . 
   the news channel this is coming out of , is paid by the us . 
  it is propaganda . 
  and i thought i pay for zdf with my tv fees . 
  til . 
   i would think most germans would vote for bernie sanders . 
  almost nobody in germany knows or cares who bernie sanders is . 
  also known as : efta, 
  and it wo n't happen . 
    to put this into context , 1gb of data is about half a day 's use of facebook , snapchat or instagram at best . 
  it 's utterly insufficient . 
  so where do people in germany get these 60 gb contracts to get over the month ? 
  according to stratfor reports we have been doomed since basically forever . 
  and is that `` perma ban '' actually permanent ? 
  because i doubt that . 
  if i had to guess i would say you `` just '' have to reapply ( not do be confused with going through driving school again ) for a driving permit and the authorities will decide if you are fit for driving . 
  and if not they 'll tell you what you have to do to become fit for driving again , i.e. 
  attending anti aggression training or proving sobriety for a year . 
  whereas the temporary suspension ends automatically and you 'll automatically get your license back . 
  because they entered `` au '' or `` aus '' into the field that will be populated with the flag instead of `` at '' or `` aut '' . 
  they did n't google `` flag of australia '' and pasted the result into the document . 
  military ~ ~ aged ~ ~ men !, 
  \\ / r/europe is your girlfriend 's crazy stepdad ? 
  caching basically . 
  statista originally had the australia flag . 
  once they noticed their error they changed the image on their server . 
  inside the thread , reddit shows the version they saved on their own server when the thread was created . 
  -- the `` real '' image : https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_8890_how_to_lose_your_driving_license_in_europe_n.jpg the cached image which is shown inside the reddit thread : https://i.redditmedia.com/kujjo2dfak2a1v2a7ysnyfkr0pjhtlskhugjvkklqr8.jpg?w=614&amp;s=6475181f531178763b8b737fc7d8562f, 
  the most important point to distinguish between normal employment and self-employment is the ability to set your own prices . 
  and uber drivers ca n't do that . 
  they were so busy improving the gdp that they forgot a comma after ` no ' . 
   no , public holidays should be dissolved . 
   you know what 's cheap ? 
  not paying taxes . 
  and not following local regulation . 
  taxis in germany have to go to inspection every year . 
  taxis need a special insurance for passengers . 
  taxi drivers have to do regular health checks .
