  `` personnel id '' , because germans are all employees of the deutschland gmbh . 
   ironically , you 're doing he same thing . 
  did i miss how new-atlantis spoke to a tv reporter ? 
  probably vegetarian cyclists that are controlled by berlin . 
   just because somebody is born in a certain country it does n't give him any more rights to just consume welfare . 
  it does n't ? 
  if someone is born in a certain country it 's very likely that their parents contributed in that certain country . 
   or what do we do with all current truck drivers that will be made redundant in 10 years ? 
  if they contributed in a certain country , they should have access to welfare in that certain country . 
  do n't act like there 's a slippery slope . 
  just because foreigners do n't have access to welfare in germany does n't mean that we 'll eventually refuse to pay welfare to germans . 
  why do they always wait that long . 
  if they are responsible they should send out the press releases the moment the attack happens . 
  risky game . 
  too many of these `` vetos '' and the other eu members will reconsider their position regarding multi-speed europe . 
  their love for flexible solidarity . 
  i would bet you 'll enter a temporary agreement to continue membership in the single market and eu customs union until a trade deal is negotiated . 
  the current eu budget period is 2014-2020 . 
  when the uk leaves the eu , we will still be in the current budget for another 21 months . 
  it 's not quite clear what they mean . 
  but the eu uses 7 year budgets . 
  the current budget will end with the end of 2020 . 
  so the uk would have to continue to contribute for 21 months after leaving the eu . 
   it would get hit anyway , what difference does it make if the laptop is in the baggage area . 
  explosives or chemical weapons that require multiple components ? 
  you have a laptop with perfectly safe component a that looks like a laptop battery . 
  your accomplice has a laptop with component b. 
  add a and b together and the plane goes boom . 
  ca n't do that if you hand over both components during check-in . 
  or maybe they believe the laptop battery itself can be used to cause something . 
   while i agree this is stupid , you would just have to put your laptop in the hold . 
  so it can be stolen by luggage handlers . 
   which was already unfair to the new member states because they could n't impose any limits on e.g. 
  western european capital buying up their assets . 
  maybe they did n't ask to continue such restrictions ? 
  for example poland continued to restrict the acquisition of agricultural and forest properties for 12 years . 
   in fact defense spending actually decreased after 2014 as a fraction of germany 's gdp . 
  from 1.19 % in 2014 to 1.18 % in 2015 . 
  and in real money from 34.749 billion euro to 35.898 billion euro . 
  and how much of that decrease was planned ? 
  the budget is decided more than a year before you know your gdp . 
  when the economy grows faster than expected , the % - of-gdp of budget items will decrease . 
  you ca n't put `` plagued by inaccuracies '' in your headline when you mingle all kinds of immigration together . 
  who ca n't afford to start a family in germany ? 
  people just do n't want to have children . 
  probably still exhausted from his trip to south korea . 
  playing golf in florida helps with that . 
  think of all that jet lag from traveling to brussels . 
  spending in all underspending nato members has increased last year . 
  how does the us react ? 
  cut welfare , increase defence budget by 50 billion . 
  so the us can start winning again . 
  the us also needs an even more massive navy . 
  because europe demands it . 
  or so . 
  stop with that subsidising welfare argument . 
  nato members are n't the reason why the us does n't spend more on welfare . 
  the us sets its defence budget without having nato in mind . 
  the us wo n't spend a single dollar less if other nato members spend more . 
  there are valid arguments for spending more . 
  `` we too could have welfare if we would n't need to protect you '' is n't one . 
  i doubt that the number of mothers with german citizenship who are of syrian descend is relevant . 
  but feel free to dig up numbers that are more relevant . 
  so they basically repeated 20 year old stereotypes about mail order brides from eastern europe . 
  that 's like mario barth level of boring and cringy . 
  good decision to cancel the show . 
  since the old article does n't mention actual numbers i 'll help you guys out . 
  [ 2015 live birth statistics ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/presseservice/presse/pressemitteilungen/2016/09/pd16_332_126.html ) . 
  of 737,575 ( 2014 : 714,927 ) live births in 2015 , 589,670 ( 2014 : 584,301 ) had a german mother . 
  of the 147,905 ( 2014 : 130,626 ) foreign mothers : - 21,555 ( 2014 : 21,908 ) were from turkey - 10,831 ( 2014 : 9,958 ) from poland - 8,154 ( 2014 : 5,551 ) from romania - 7,146 ( 2014 : 6,080 ) from kosovo - 5,982 ( 2014 : 5,568 ) from italy - 5,616 ( 2014 : 4,957 ) from serbia - 5,458 ( 2014 : 5,553 ) from russia - 4,829 ( 2014 : 2,281 ) from syria - 4,202 ( 2014 : 3,135 ) from bulgaria - 3,245 ( 2014 : 2,957 ) from greece, 
  do you believe the eu would stop eastern european countries from joining future areas of cooperation ? 
  you 're just saying that because you want presents . 
  that 's what the dublin regulations are for . 
  they contain things besides the first country principle . 
  if someone requests asylum in greece , and tells the greek authorities that they have family in germany , greece will issue a dublin relocation request with germany . 
  germany then checks if the asylum seeker has in fact family members in germany and if the regulations are applicable . 
  if that 's the case germany will be responsible for the asylum seeker and they can travel to germany . 
   and when they get processed they get sent back immediately because morocco is stable and safe . 
  you mean they get sent back when morocco can no longer delay the process of returning them . 
  if i remember correctly morocco is one of the countries ( the other being tunisia ) that issues identification papers that are only valid for 2 weeks . 
  german police requests the return of a denied asylum seekers with morocco . 
  morocco takes months to check the paperwork . 
  they deny that this is their citizen and request more prove . 
  when they finally issue travel documents they are valid for 14 days . 
  if the german police does n't manage to return the person within these 14 days , they have to start the whole process again . 
  there is a reason why something like 80 % of the people that germany returns are from the west balkan . 
  because these countries cooperate with german authorities in useful ways . 
  the goal of morocco and tunisia is to delay as much as possible . 
  it 's a way to extort more money . 
  unfortunately the eu does n't speak with one voice in these matters . 
  plenty of businesses in my area do n't find germans that want to work in certain positions for realistic salaries . 
  if the far-right would n't be busy complaining about people stealing their jobs , they could apply and more importantly stay in these jobs . 
  then these businesses would n't need to hire all these dirty foreigners . 
  who is making excuses ? 
  some people just are n't satisfied with `` he was muslim . 
  case closed '' . 
  everyone can have a beard . 
  must be well groomed though . 
  and if you want to grow one you have to do it during your vacation time . 
  though i doubt that the unbearded people who returned with a respectable beard from their afghanistan deployment followed that part .
