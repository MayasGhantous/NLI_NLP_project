  there 's still a large difference . 
  saxony has the largest gdp per capita of the 5 eastern states ( let 's ignore berlin ) , with 27,776 $ . 
  whole germany has a gdp per capita of 37,099 $ . 
  bavaria has a gdp per capita of 43,092 $, 
  guys !, 
  we finally found something that greeks and turks can agree upon !, 
   europeans owe us a lot thank you for your service . 
  that endless stream of 3 million asylum seekers that came to the eu in the last 5 years ? 
  europe has a population of 500 million people . 
  that is n't the situation we have . 
  if you make up numbers you can obviously always make it more dramatic . 
  feel free to dig up these numbers and show them . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  but i do n't see how age is relevant if we 're talking about demographic shifts . 
  what matters is fertility rate and to a lesser extent the age when you reach that fertility rate . 
  i do n't get it . 
  which part of that article is relevant for the discussion of the number of turkish mothers who gave birth in 2015 ? 
  we 're talking about the demographic shifts in this part of the thread . 
  if we ignore 2015 , or look at 2010-2015 we would see that the vast majority of immigration in germany comes from other eu countries . 
  2015 was an outlier , there wo n't be another comparable mass immigration of muslims . 
  turkey is the only major country that has a negative net migration rate with germany . 
  each year more turks leave germany than come to germany . 
  unfortunately it 's the doctors , the lawyers and the engineers that leave . 
  but hey , fuck turks , amirite . 
  germany needs immigration . 
  in many regions we already have labor shortages . 
  i prefer to not stop immigration , because the vast majority of immigration is from eu countries . 
  as in 65x0 .62 which is how i got my 40 million number . 
  so you made up that long calculation to show that the result of 1.32 / 2.1 is ~ 0.62 ? 
  i do n't know how to properly calculate population estimates . 
  but i know that you do n't know it either . 
  -- would be nice if the people who downvote this and upvote the stuff from whataboutusaism would explain the math behind this . 
  fertility rate is the total amount of live births per mother . 
  it does n't matter if she has twins in one year , or if there are 10 years between her children . 
  it does n't mean amount of children per mother per year . 
  if 65 mothers have a fertility rate of 2.1 they give birth to 136.5 million children . 
  not per year . 
  per lifetime . 
  -- but let 's assume you are correct . 
  so 65 million mothers will give birth to 6.825 billion people in 50 years . 
  sounds stupid if you ask me . 
  because the majority of these children will live until 70 + years . 
  will get pretty crowded in germany . 
  / u/whataboutusaism :   yes actually . 
  germany is currently 80 % non foreign background ethnically german . 
  roughly 65 million people . 
  native germans have a fertility rate of 1.32 . 
  replacement rate is 2.1   2.1 x 50 x 65 million - 1.32 x 50 x 65 million = 25.35 . 
    germany will lose 25million ethnic germans in 50 years . 
    40million population out of 80mil is 50 % . 
  your math sucks 2.1 x 50 x 65 million = 6825 million = 6.825 billion 1.32 x 50 x 65 million = 4290 million = 4.290 billion you have just calculated the amount of children 65 million mothers have when they give birth to 2.1 respectively 1.32 children 50 times . 
  demographics is a bit more complicated than that . 
  but nice try . 
  i doubt that . 
  romania , poland and bulgaria make up 59 % of the eu citizens that moved to germany in 2015 . 
  do you use some math to come to that conclusion ? 
  or feels ? 
  \\ + 980,000 asylum seekers \\ + 911,000 eu citizens -- 579,000 eu citizens in every year that was n't 2015 we had more eu net migration then asylum net migration . 
  but of course it 's 2015 that will decide the demographic war . 
  source : migrationsbericht 2015 . https://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/migrationsberichte/migrationsbericht-2015.html, 
  925,200 people died in germany in 2015 . 
  no statistics about how many of them are german . 
  can you use these numbers to estimate when we 'll become the minority ? 
  just assume that all of them were german if that makes the calculation easier . 
  maybe i 'm safe because non-german europeans have more children in germany than the muslim world . 
  yep . 
  in 9 months we 'll be in the minority . 
  game over guys . 
  i see what you did there ... 
   just look at the demographic shifts taking place . 
  i 'm looking . 
  what should i see . 
  please tell me . 
  particularly i 'm looking at the number of [ live births in germany in 2015 ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/presseservice/presse/pressemitteilungen/2016/09/pd16_332_126.html ) . 
  of 737,575 ( 2014 : 714,927 ) live births , 589,670 ( 2014 : 584,301 ) had a german ( yes , yes , that includes `` germans '' ) mother . 
  of the 147,905 ( 2014 : 130,626 ) foreign mothers : - 21,555 ( 2014 : 21,908 ) were from turkey - 10,831 ( 2014 : 9,958 ) from poland - 8,154 ( 2014 : 5,551 ) from romania - 7,146 ( 2014 : 6,080 ) from kosovo - 5,982 ( 2014 : 5,568 ) from italy - 5,616 ( 2014 : 4,957 ) from serbia - 5,458 ( 2014 : 5,553 ) from russia - 4,829 ( 2014 : 2,281 ) from syria - 4,202 ( 2014 : 3,135 ) from bulgaria - 3,245 ( 2014 : 2,957 ) from greece should i be scared ? 
  any estimates when `` i '' will become the minority ? 
   wondering what people think about a major world leader explicitly saying this , even though it has been going on for a long time . 
  what has going on for a long time ? 
  that muslims who migrate to europe drop down to more european fertility rates within one generation ? 
  and they wo n't change that because erdogan says so . 
  that 's precisely what he wants . 
  they hate us !, 
  they do n't want you to vote for me !, 
  because only i am able to protect you from nazi-eu !, 
  now vote for me !, 
  20 $ per hour gets you barely over the threshold of the blue card program for it jobs . 
  now you just need a university degree and someone who is willing to hire you . 
  thank you . 
  when i hear people talk about the bureaucracy involved in running a business in germany i 'm always scared that we might do something illegal because we 're not spending 90 % of our time filling out forms . 
  the night-club fire is a metaphor for things that harm people in venues that do n't follow risk assessment procedures and ignore basic measures like emergency access because it would hinder entrepreneurship . 
  i 'm self-employed . 
  one part of my work is organising , preparing and running events like dance parties . 
  i do n't like the bureaucracy and the extra work that is involved . 
  we once had a party in an old factory building . 
  the public order office forced us to add more emergency exits . 
  for a one-time event , we cut doors into the walls , and poured concrete stairs . 
  the public order office comes to every event and makes sure that every lamp has a safety cable attached to prevent it from falling down . 
  the fire marshal checks if we have enough functioning fire extinguishers and if the safety exits are adequate . 
  he checks if the fabric materials we use are fire-retardant .
