  that 's why they can be considered startups . 
  a normal business has to prioritise profitability over growth for most of its existence . 
  if you constantly lose money you have to change your business . 
  because at one point your savings are gone and if you took a loan you have to pay it back . 
  these are n't considered startups . 
  but yes , there is no 100 % objective definition of startup . 
   avast_software founded 1988 ; 29 years ago received funding of an undisclosed amount from cvc capital partners in 2014 . 
  which does non-vc investments too . 
  and they seem to be profitable . 
  so they are one of the candidates that might be falsely placed in the map . 
   ozon.ru launched 1998 still not profitable . 
  received funding from systema ** venture capital ** in january 2017 . 
   spotify founded 23 april 2006 ; 10 years ago still not profitable . 
  received funding from harmony partners in july 2016 , according to themselves a boutique ** venture capital ** firm that invests in expansion stage companies . 
  startup pretty much means that your company recently received venture capital . 
  which tttech did in 2015 . https://www.tttech.com/de/news-events/pressemeldungen/details/audi-ge-infineon-investieren-in-tttech/, 
   and just last year acquired avg for 1,3 billion $ in part paid by the undisclosed amount they raised from a venture capital firm in 2014 . 
   what defines being a ` startup ' in this case ? 
  a company that recently received venture capital . 
  which is pretty much the general definition of startup . 
  startup does n't mean `` recently founded business '' . 
  most businesses are n't startups at all . 
  vc is pretty much mandatory to be considered a startup . 
  tax avoidance is all about finding loopholes so parts of your profits are n't taxed at all . 
  if you have to pay a tax rate of 25 to 30 % and you manage to find loopholes so only 30 % of your total profits have to be taxed , you suddenly have an effective tax rate over all your profits of 7.5 to 9 %, 
  the netherlands just have generous exemptions . 
  does n't matter that they charge 25 to 30 % if they exempt large parts of your profits because you just transferred them from a subsidiary in a different eu country . 
  the most sophisticated of these schemes involve multiple countries and even more companies that are set up in a very specific way . 
  one scheme is known as `` double irish with a dutch sandwich '' . 
  you transfer your profits to a company in ireland . 
  you then transfer the profits to a company in the netherlands . 
  then you transfer your profits back to a second company in ireland which is headquartered in a tax haven . 
  and because of the combination of weird tax laws , you are subject to very little tax on your profits . 
  they are guarded by americans with guns . 
  i doubt that erdogan would attack them . 
  but even if they are successful with that attack , they still do n't have functioning nuclear weapons . 
  without the launch codes turkey will only be in possession of the nuclear material . 
  bad enough , but they just killed american soldiers , and are now in the possession of american nuclear weapons . 
  guess how the us will react to that . 
  un is nazis . 
  it 's literally in their name . 
  united nazis . 
  countries could always do that . 
  the discussion about multi-speed europe was to figure out if they should . 
  and it looks like they came to the conclusion that they should n't . 
  we continue with unanimity among all 28/27 members even if it means complete stagnation . 
  maybe poland allows them to reuse the map they used to explain the votes for tusk . 
  more like an attack on our labor market . 
  in most countries and in most jobs , brits will simply compete with eu nationals . 
  there are n't that many eu countries that brits would migrate to anyway . 
  and since we have countries with high unemployment in the union it would make more sense if these countries find ways to attract people from greece or spain instead of brits . 
  with the same argument you could say we should open our borders for everyone . 
  why should brits get freedom of movement when canadians or australians ca n't ? 
  truly high skilled workers can apply for a blue card . 
  except denmark and ireland all eu-27 countries participate . 
  all you need is a university degree and a job offer that pays 1.5 ( less if you work in a sparse sector like it , stem , human medicine ) the national average salary . 
  in germany in it you qualify with a gross salary of 38,688 $ . 
  people without these qualifications will no longer be able to come . 
  the people who think they are high skilled who move to berlin to work as barista while they try to found their `` next big thing '' startup . 
  it 's a bit ambiguous . 
  how i read it , he believes that brits who are currently residents of other eu countries should be able to keep their benefits . 
  in that case i have to agree , somewhat . 
  they should all get a permanent residence permit in the country of their current residence . 
  and they should be able to vote and be voted in municipal elections . 
  however , in my opinion they have to lose their right to freedom of movement and the right to vote in eu elections . 
  uk should obviously get visa-free access to the eu , but i doubt that anyone questions this . 
  how others may read it : every uk citizens continues to be a defacto eu citizen , a brit with all rights of a eu citizen . 
  and i 'm strongly against that . 
  they decided to leave , so they have to leave . 
  the eu will refuse access to things the uk wants . 
  no more schengen information system . 
  no more military version of galileo . 
  there are probably other things the uk wants access to . 
   why do n't you build your country better ? 
  why do n't you change your country so tax payers no longer have to pay for foreign students ? 
  for tourists and business visitors who want to visit the schengen area for 90 days in every 180 day period . 
  they are not allowed to work during that time . 
  please elaborate . 
  why should your company be fined if you change your branding slightly ? 
   i dont get it which part of this you westerners dont understand . 
  the part where you ca n't even be bothered to not eat nutella , to not drink sprite or to not eat fish sticks . 
  these are luxury products . 
  they are not necessary . 
  boycotting them is easy . 
  but instead of eastern europeans who call their countryman for a boycott , your politicians run to the eu . 
  the same politicians that often complain that there is too much bureaucracy in the eu now want an incredible amount of bureaucracy to tackle a problem that the market can solve itself . 
  the customer has to stop buying these lesser quality products . 
  and you 'll see that the market works as intended . 
  because there is no market failure , which means the eu wo n't interfere . 
  that 's the point . 
  the consumer is okay with buying `` shitty '' nutella , because not buying nutella is really hard . 
  so there 's no reason to sell `` real '' nutella . 
  i can only say it again , the only way to change that is consumer action . 
  the eu wo n't act in this matter . 
  because that 's a problem the market can solve . 
  and the eu stance on market interference is to do it as little as possible . 
  not sure if its a market failure . 
  apparently the average consumer in eastern europe cares so little about the quality of their products that they ca n't even be bothered to boycott things like nutella , sprite or fish sticks . 
  if nutella `` eastern europe edition '' sales would plummet , retailers would stock the real product quicker than the eu can sign a memorandum of understanding about equal quality food . 
  do n't eat nutella .
