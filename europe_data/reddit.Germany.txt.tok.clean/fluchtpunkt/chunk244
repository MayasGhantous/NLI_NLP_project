  largest export is non-fillet fresh fish , valued at a bit less than 5 million us-dollar . 
  botanically tomatoes are fruits . 
  perks they can get as a non-eu country under rules for non-eu countries . 
   doesnt say a race but the profile for this sort of attack is of muslims . 
  so what does the statistic say about serial acid attackers ? 
  can you link some cases ? 
  if each incident would be an individual targeted attack against a family member , ex partner or similar , everyone would agree that the cases were very likely perpetrated by muslims who have a strange interpretation of honor . 
  but multiple attacks per night perpetrated with a water pistol from a bicycle ? 
  there are like 14,000 muslims in colombia . 
  yet the country has recently seen around 100 acid attacks per year . 
  like 90 % of them are perpetrated by men whose attitude is `` if i ca n't have her , nobody should have her '' . 
  do you get citizenship or permanent residency rights ? 
   why would i hate someone just because he is from a certain country . 
  because he 's a brit ? 
  are you confusing citizenship and residence rights ? 
  once you get citizenship you do n't have to live in any country . 
  i 'm not aware that there are countries that revoke your citizenship just because you do n't live in them . 
  citizenship is irrevocable for the most part , that 's why they are hard to get . 
  i 'm also not aware that there 's a eu/eea/swiss country that offers citizenship without at least living there for ~ 5 years and more . 
  there are countries that sell residence permits though . 
  but that wo n't help you , because being in possession of a residence permit does n't count towards the time you have to live in the country . 
  and a residence permit wo n't allow you to make use of freedom of movement to work and live in liechtenstein . 
   so far none of the debt has ever been written off in october 2011 the value of greek bonds that were in the possession of private bankers was cut in half . 
  if you want to help birds , replace cats with wind generators . 
  so check it . 
  the list of billionaires is usually public knowledge . 
   i do n't understand what you mean by this . 
  `` if germans would understand what happened they would vote afd '', 
   this situation could have been handled much better like getting ` refugees ' to present valid passports or demonstrate valid skills in syrian . 
  that 's what happens . 
  you wo n't get asylum just because you say `` i 'm syrian , i swear '' . 
  there 's a reason why it takes months to handle asylum applications . 
  btw , the official language of syria is arabic . 
   also put an upper limit of say 500k people so integration could maybe take place and not create ghettos on the outskirts of the cities . 
  how do you enforce an upper limit if you ca n't even keep out the people that say `` i 'm tunisian '' ? 
   take age tests to at least exclude people over 22 years to be in the same rooms as 14-15yr old girls . 
  that 's what happens . 
   but what do i know basic common sense is racist nowadays . 
  well meme 'd bro . 
  [ these are the restrictive measures the eu enacted ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/ ) : - ** limit access to eu primary and secondary capital markets ** for 5 major russian majority state-owned financial institutions and their majority-owned subsidiaries established outside of the eu , as well as three major russian energy and three defence companies - impose an ** export and import ban on trade in arms ** - establish an ** export ban for dual-use goods ** for military use or military end users in russia - curtail russian ** access to certain sensitive technologies and services ** that can be used for oil production and exploration russia then retaliated with a ban on the import of foodstuff from the eu . 
  we tried to be friendly with russia . 
  then they invaded georgia , and we tried to ignore that because maybe being friendly shows the that peace is the way to go forward . 
  then they invaded ukraine . 
  ask russia . 
  the eu sanctions do n't target the average citizen . 
   second , what the fuck does this have to do with 1984 ? 
  the majority of the people that use 1984 in arguments have n't read it . 
  ( i did n't either ), 
  what does that mean ? 
  no passport on earth includes visa . 
  but many allow you visa-free travel . 
  and the most desirable passports in that list allow you to travel visa-free to the usa . 
  and now run the same numbers and convert to '' % of gdp '' in the end . 
  i recommend to join the eurasian union just to spite the eu . 
  from a european perspective there is just nothing positive about brexit . 
  as koreldan sad , we are sad that the uk leaves . 
  pro life sounds better than pro birth . 
   because most germans are leftists leftists who continue to elect center-right and center-left parties instead of left-wing parties . 
   like the one that makes the beer you like . 
  so heineken , carlsberg and beck 's ? 
  that 's why some clinics only give donor sperm to married couples . 
  in a marriage the husband automatically becomes the legal father , who is responsible for paying child support . 
  but yeah , we need to change a couple laws to make donorship safer from a financial point of view . 
  keep the right to know your father , but remove financial responsibilities . 
  fun fact : support goes both ways . 
  if your child is rich and you are old and poor , your `` donated child '' might have to pay for your support . 
  in germany it 's a huge taboo to violate someones privacy without consent . 
  paternity tests are also far from illegal in germany . 
  laws were changed in 2008 to make it easier . 
  however they are still illegal to do without consent of any of the involved parties . 
  which means that you as the ( alleged ) father have to ask the child , and the mother to get a paternity test . 
  if they refuse you go to the family court , explain your case and if they believe that you have valid interest in knowing if you are the father , they will waive the requirement for consent . 
  which is pretty much a given if you are the husband or if you a liable for paying child-support . 
  you can easily switch the involved parties . 
  if a child wants to know if they are the child of their parents , they have to ask the parents for consent . 
  if the mother wants to know if the alleged father is the father , she has to ask father and the child for consent . 
  the court will waive the need for consent as well . 
  except if it does n't , like the case mentioned in the article . 
  the court said that the right to know ones heritage only applies in the boundary of a family . 
  so you can force your father to do a paternity test if he lives in your family . 
  you are not allowed to force an arbitrary person to do a paternity test . 
   why is someone insane , who tries to enhance the chance that his genes survive ? 
  because you might have to talk to the children that were born with your genes . 
  some people do n't like that idea . 
  not true . 
  because men already have the right to do a paternity test ( \u00a7 17 abs . 
  7 gendg ; \u00a7 1598a abs . 
  which will determine if they are the father or not . 
  this new law is about determining who the father is , not if the husband is the father . 
  if you believe that you are n't the father ask your wife to agree to a paternity test , if she refuses go to the family court . 
  and they will most likely allow you to do a paternity test without her consent . 
  in what timescale ? 
  of course we would n't declare war on each other the next day after the eu collapses . 
  but two decades from now ? 
  who knows . 
   they 're always hypocrites . 
  they want their goods to be sold in the us , but do n't want us goods in their countries . 
  because half your goods come from china .

  this has nothing to do with trump .
