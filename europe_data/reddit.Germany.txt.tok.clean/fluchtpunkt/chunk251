  is milk chocolate inferior to 99 % cocoa chocolate ? 
  billions of children will disagree . 
  single market means that sellers can sell in all countries , and that buyers can buy in all countries . 
  it does n't mean that a seller has to sell in all countries . 
  and it certainly does n't mean that sellers have to sell the same product to everyone . 
  to take it to a more obvious level . 
  in your proposed single market a company would not be allowed to sell superman comics written in german while also selling superman comics written in polish . 
  the single market allows you to open a business that buys nutella in germany and sells it in poland . 
   a lot of americans would kill to live in the uk , eu or not , myself included . 
  so you would migrate to the uk to work in a minimum wage job ? 
  currently that 's # 7.20 or 9 us-dollar per hour . 
  it is in countries that want to keep their welfare system . 
  so lets look at the usage statistics for petroleum products , i.e. 
  oil . 
  2014 energy consumption of petroleum products by sector in the eu : - other : 15.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent - services : 15.3 million tonnes - industry : 27.7 million tonnes - households : 33.8 million tonnes - transport : 330.1 million tonnes so the industry used 6.7 % of the oil equivalent of all petroleum products that were used in the eu to make plastic , chemicals and medicines . 
  on the other hand we used 78.1 % of all petroleum products in the eu to move things around . 
  sometimes different markets actually prefer a different taste of a product . 
  how would the eu distinguish equal quality products with different taste from products that actually are of inferior quality ? 
  is the coffee at mcdonalds uk really inferior just because it has a lower content of arabica compared to coffee sold in a german mcdonalds ? 
  is austrian/polish sprite inferior because it only contains 19g sugar per 330ml can instead of the 22g sugar it contains in the uk ? 
  watched the first 5 minutes . 
  where 's the part about the nuclear vessels that await decommissioning ? 
  if i remember correctly , the polish government has enacted laws to fight against that since then . 
  until you reach the point where the bubble bursts and your economy contracts . 
  suddenly your debt-to-gdp ratio increases . 
  and your credit rating will tank , to the point where you can no longer get now loans to pay back old debt . 
  greece only used half of the `` increase spending when economy is shit , reduce spending when economy is good '' equation . 
  that 's why they are where they are . 
  not because the eurozone governments do n't understand keynesian investments . 
  is there also a saying about not doing anything and complaining about those who do ? 
  because afghanistan , bahrain , chad , egypt , iran , iraq , jordan , libya , morocco , niger , qatar , saudi arabia , turkey and the united arab emirates use their military to fight against daesh . 
  austria does n't . 
  but which is the region that breaks away ? 
  which part of a country will stay in the eu ? 
  the one with the capital ? 
   they were not accruing more debt . 
  - greece gdp in 2000 : $ 130b - greece debt-to-gdp rate in 2000 : 103 % - greece gdp in 2005 : $ 248b - greece debt-to-gdp rate in 2005 : 100 % so greece had $ 134b debt in 2000 . 
  and $ 248b debt in 2005 . 
  germans also do n't mind that things like tax rates , welfare payments , pensions and tax code enforcement policies are set by the federal government . 
  greece would tweet \\ #thisisacoup if someone would suggest that these should fall into the responsibility of a eurozone government . 
   yes i am willing to pay more tax for greece , and for portugal . 
  if i find out the iban for the donation account of the greece and portuguese government , how much money will you send them ? 
   i am not saying we just solve the debt and forget about it obviously . 
  because that comes with a bill of more than 1,200 $ per eurozone citizen . 
   there needs to be agreements and things put in place to stop it happening again . 
  so you want to ignore the no-bailouts agreement to bailout a country in hopes that they wo n't ignore a no-more-bailouts-this-time-for-real agreement ? 
   creditors where not interest in debt repayment creditors are not interested in handing out more money to gamble on the chance that greece can now do what it failed to do in the past . 
  which is to use loans to create an economy that makes it less reliable on loans in the future . 
  there 's a high chance that the creditors will just end up with more debt that wo n't be paid back . 
  there is a reason why the greek pre-crisis debt-to-gdp ratio was stable over many years of economic growth . 
  greece can only grow its economy with an ever increasing government spending . 
  if it would be as easy as you claim to improve their economy long-term just by using more debt , non governmental creditors would form long lines to give them money . 
   yes , and if there is no way to convince people to do this , the eu project is doomed to fail . 
  and germany will fail because people living in city a are n't responsible for bailing out city b ? 
   this just all showcases how you can not create a single currency and taxation system for multiple economies . 
  that we do n't actually have a single taxation system is part of the problem . 
   if they had the drachme , they would have had more options . 
  now they are stuck between a rock and a hard place . 
  they could have pretended that it is n't austerity if you print new money without having an economy to back the newly printed money . 
   a default was always on the table . 
  would n't have changed a thing . 
  a default does not magically get rid of your debt . 
  default just means that you do n't pay your debt . 
  the debt still exists . 
  there 's a reason why countries try to avoid a default . 
  a default comes with a lot more problems than troika style austerity . 
  especially if you import twice the amount you export . 
  when grexit was on the table , politicians who said humanitarian aid would be provided by the eu were n't joking . 
   but besides all that - if they could n't win that point , they should have given up on governing altogether . 
  which would have been a pointless statement that would n't lead to anything besides uncertainty which would hurt the greek economy even more . 
  maybe they realized that their only choice is austerity because nobody besides the troika wanted to lend to them . 
  stupid 15 year old liberal arts majors , amirite . 
   freedom of movement inside the borders of your country is a basic human right . 
  and the danish law targets neighborhoods . 
   obama also did something similar , targeting specifically iraq , i believe , and no one said shit . 
  because in this case `` something similar '' means something completely different . 
  obama stopped vetting new asylum applicants from these seven countries for half a year . 
  but that only affected people who would request asylum after the day of his executive order . 
  iraqis who had a business visa were allowed to travel to the us . 
  syrians who already received asylum were allowed to travel to the us . 
  us green card holders with citizenship of iran were allowed to return to their homes in the us . 
  trump banned everyone with citizenship from one of these seven countries from entering the country . 
  iraqis who had a business visa were not allowed to travel to the us . 
  syrians who already received asylum were not allowed to travel to the us . 
  us green card holders with citizenship of iran were not allowed to return to their homes in the us . 
  they probably love him for his constant use of ` fake news ' , which is the english word for l\u00fcgenpresse , which is the most favorite term of the afd base . 
  did they make up evidence back then as well ? 
  how about this ? 
  other eurozone governments and institutions like the imf lead by example and shave off some debt ? 
  contrary to popular believe germany is not the sole lender . 
  still waiting ...

  two germans meet in the train , one of them reads \\ / r/europe , the other one asks `` hans , why do you read this shit ? 
  they hate us . 
  they blame us for all their problems '' . 
  hans answers `` franz , when i read a real newspaper all i read about is our crumbling infrastructure , our incapable military , and how we ca n't even make tunisia cooperate with us . 
  but when i read \\ / r/europe i read about how important we are . 
  everyone does what we say , we call the shots in europe .
