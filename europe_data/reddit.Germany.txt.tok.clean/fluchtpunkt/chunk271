  that 's also how you can beat up any person you want . 
  go out of your way to bully the locals 2 . 
  eventually one of them will try to beat you up 3 . 
  you are now entitled to self-defense 4 . 
  beat them up without punishment conclusion : get rid of self-defense laws because it will be abused to no end . 
  recidivism rates disagree . 
   and the same france that only puts ~ ~ 1.6 % ~ ~ 1.78 % ( 2016 estimate ) gdp compared to the uk 's ~ ~ 3.4 % ~ ~ 2.21 % ( 2016 estimate ) on military expenditure . 
  fixed that for you . 
  but that 's just illuminated in red and gold . 
  no black illumination !, 
  hence it 's the flag of pretoria , south africa and not the flag of germany . 
  merkel hating germany confirmed !, 
   furthermore there seems to be some kind of rule of physics that there can be no more than 3 tax brackets . 
  your country has 4 . 
  germany has 5 . 
  the us has 7 . 
  france has 8 . 
  what a strange way to report that data . 
  the article talks about refugees , and then it ignores the peak of the migration crisis and uses immigration data from 2010 to 2014 . 
  here 's the number of refugees that came to germany in these years : - 2010 : 41,332 - 2011 : 45,741 - 2012 : 64,539 - 2013 : 109,580 - 2014 : 173,072 here 's the net migration of eu citizens ( sans germans ) in these years : - 2010 : +87,175 - 2011 : +190,738 - 2012 : +259,554 - 2013 : +300,716 - 2014 : +339,309 here 's the total net migration ( sans germans ) , including eu citizens and refugees : - 2010 +153,925 - 2011 +302,858 - 2012 +387,149 - 2013 +450,464 - 2014 +576,924 when looking at the data that is supposedly used by the article it becomes clear that it 's the migration of eu citizens that helps to halt the population decline the most . 
  obviously that changes when you look solely at the peak of the migration crisis .

  not according to nato http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160704_160704-pr2016-116.pdf, 
  so he will support the trade deal for a couple of building permits . 
  why do i have the feeling that this survey is fake news in itself ? 
  the majority of these intercepts are military planes that fly from russian mainland to kaliningrad . 
  they fly in international airspace but without transponders . 
  them flying without transponders makes them basically invisible for civilian air traffic control . 
  so nato jets escort them through areas where they pose a risk for civilian air traffic , which is basically everywhere . 
  the escorting nato jets fly with transponders enabled , so civilian atc can see them . 
  source and disclaimer : my information comes from various articles about baltic air policing on luftwaffe.de , bundeswehr.de and nato.int . 
  so some ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ bias might be involved . 
  maybe these russian planes without transponders do n't pose any risk to civilian air traffic at all and this is all for show . 
  it 's a gamble for the countries as well . 
  that we cut development aid does not necessarily mean that we do n't send people back . 
  we could also cut development aid and forcefully return their people against their will . 
  your victim complex prevented the realisation that the article is about countries like tunisia and not about eastern europe . 
   on thursday , the french and german deployments at nato 's bases in siauliai , lithuania , and in amari , estonia , will be replaced by a dutch deployment . 
  not quite . 
  the dutch air force replaced the french unit in lithuania . 
  the german air force does a second four-month turn in estonia . 
  the shot people on the german-german border did n't prevent people from trying , you know . 
  just have to mark the gun-wielding non-terrorists clearly so they are n't accidentally shot in the chaos that follows a terrorist attack . 
   investing you mean exploiting, 
  if only somebody would tell all the unemployed people that they just have to work to be able to live good lives . 
  in basically all jurisdictions the right to self defence ends when the attack has ended . 
  which is certainly the case if someone is fleeing . 
  if the kidnapped child is still with the attacker the attack has n't ended and you are safe to kill the culprit . 
  lets hope that you are a good shooter . 
  according to the law you have to transport a weapon separately from ammunition under all circumstances . 
  as i said , brexit caused confusion . 
  you want access to the single market ? 
  congratulations , you already have it under wto rules . 
  you want tariff free access ? 
  become part of a free trade agreement . 
  or be a developing country and sign a economic partnership agreement . 
  you want access without tariffs and without non-tariff barriers in some market areas ? 
  sign a free trade agreement that includes harmonised regulations . 
  you want access that extends even further than that ? 
  become a member of the single market and accept the four pillars . 
  according to googles reverse image search the photo was taken during the `` eidgen\u00f6ssisches feldschiessen '' event in 2015 . 
  which is a nationwide event organised by the swiss military , photo is from zurich . 
  the two weapons pictured are the service weapons sturmgewehr 90 and sturmgewehr 57 . 
   itt : one guy calling op a neo-nazi , several people defending op from that accusation . 
  fixed that for you . 
  here 's the number of eu countries that receive development aid : 0 . 
  probably brexit caused confusion about the term ` access ' . 
  many people in here seem to believe that `` access to the single market '' means things like freedom of movement of workers . 
   ( do n't ask me for the name of the program , i do n't remember ) [ economic partnership agreements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_partnership_agreements ) with the [ african , caribbean and pacific group of states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/african,_caribbean_and_pacific_group_of_states ) . 
  in the past they were pretty one-sided . 
  after wto complains , these agreements are as reciprocal as required by wto rules . 
  partnership countries are still able to protect their market in key areas . 
  they are now open to all developing economies , even if outside the acp , too . 
  how does closing the border look like in a schengen country without external borders ( outside of airports and ports ) ? 
  there are no border checkpoints . 
  there are no fences . 
  there are no walls . 
  where 's the carrot in the proposal ? 
   edit : just to clarify my absolute rejection of his proposal : access to the single market means free movement of workers , goods and services . 
  no it does n't . 
  that 's membership in the single market . 
  every non-embargoed country in the world has access to the single market . 
  some countries also have tariff-free access to the single market . 
  and many want that access , for example tunisia is currently negotiating a free trade agreement . 
  the brexit debacle made people confused about the meaning of access . 
  why talk in past tense ? 
  in 2015 685,485 eu citizens ( sans germans ) moved to germany . 
  the number for 2016 will very likely be higher than 750,000 . 
  and that 's for germany alone . 
  the migration movements where people `` abandon '' their nations in the eu , outperform external immigration by a large margin . 
  probably talking about 604/2013 , i.e. 
  if the eu is as magical as you believe , the uk should turn into a shithole without any boycotts . 
  without the eu bureaucracy the invention of time travel was finally possible . 
  we left \u017baga\u0144 before christmas . 
  so why not use the german word piepen ? 
  when you make such bold statements you should always include some sources . 
  if you want peace , prepare for war, 
  it starts with one little gender change , next thing you know you are sitting in a dark alley in a really shitty part of town to fill out gender change forms with dirty pens that you share with other kids . 
  @realdonaldtrump : russian looking guy threw grenade on our great american troops . 
  just launched nuclear weapons on moscow .
