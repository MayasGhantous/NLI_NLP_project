  the person in police custody might not be the actual perpetrator . 
  so the correct headline is `` portugal works like every other country '', 
  the police officer did n't say it 's mandatory though . 
  in some situations it 's smart to have it with you because it makes the process easier and faster . 
  especially if you are a target of profiling . 
  and the co-worker is just wrong . 
  as i said , even germans get confused . 
  the law says that you need to have a passport or id . 
  you do n't have to have a form of id with you at all times . 
   bullshit article , is she trying to imply that a police officer being polite and not fining her for not having her id is racist ? 
  you do n't actually have to carry your id in germany . 
  you just have to own one . 
  even germans get confused about this . 
  not even the receivers want a transfer union . 
  because they have to give up fiscal sovereignty for it . 
  a `` street shooting '' in a tobacco store . 
  in other words , a robbery . 
  does he say 30 minutes after merkel gave a press statement . 
  it wo n't be a regular leave , it will be a red blue and white leave . 
  they carry weapons for self defense . 
  i seriously doubt that there are countries outside the korean peninsula that have a policy of shooting at unarmed people who try to cross the border illegally . 
  in this union of self interest nobody expects anything . 
  if italy would behave like other eu countries they would do the following : 1 . reject foreign navy vessels that want to bring migrants to italian shores 2 . veto the sanctions against russia, 
  tagesschau for example , but that 's unofficial . 
  there will be a press conference 13:00 , where details will be made official . 
   i don ; t know what italians expected ? 
  that they will be running a free ferry for migrants , bringing in hundreds , sometimes thousands people a day and that the rest of eu will just gladly take those people in ? 
  any sort of forced relocation will never be implemented . 
  the rest of the eu : - [ royal navy rescues 27 migrants found clinging to sinking dinghy in mediterranean , but another 100 feared drowned ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/17/royal-navy-rescues-27-migrants-found-clinging-to-sinking-dinghy/ ) - [ dutch navy rescues another 248 migrants from sinking ship ] ( http://nltimes.nl/2016/06/17/dutch-navy-rescues-another-248-migrants-sinking-ship ) - [ french patrol boat rescues 297 migrants off italian coast ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-france-idukkbn0o52de20150520 ) - [ german navy ship ` berlin ' rescues refugees in mediterranean ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-navy-ship-berlin-rescues-refugees-in-mediterranean/a-18941502 ) - [ polish navy rescues african migrants dingy from mediterranean ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/46527,polish-navy-rescues-african-migrants-dingy-from-mediterranean ) - [ norwegian , danish ships rescue nearly 1,000 migrants off libyan coast ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/23/1000-migrants-rescued-by-norwegian-danish-ships.html ) - [ irish navy rescues 269 migrants off libya coast ] ( http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/1204/836499-defence-forces-migrants/ ) - [ belgian navy vessel rescues hundreds of migrants tuesday in the mediterranean ] ( http://newsok.com/gallery/6032486/pictures ) - [ greece rescues hundreds of migrants in sinking ship off crete ] ( https://thewire.in/40668/greece-rescues-hundreds-of-migrants-in-sinking-ship-off-crete/ ) - [ spanish navy frigate rescues 227 migrants off libyan coast ] ( http://www.efe.com/efe/english/life/spanish-navy-frigate-rescues-227-migrants-off-libyan-coast/50000263-3105541 ) - [ nearly 400 migrants rescued by portuguese navy on central mediterranean eu mission ] ( http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/nearly-400-migrants-rescued-by-portuguese-navy-on-central-mediterranean-eu-mission/33253 ) even the us participates in the game : - [ u.s. navy rescues 282 apparent migrants in mediterranean ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/07/world/europe/us-navy-rescue-mediterranean/ ) each one of these navy vessels brought the people they rescued to italy . 
   the north african countries will back down when they ca n't access european capital and commodity markets to continue importing 20 % -80 % of their food supplies depending on the country . 
  are you seriously suggesting inducing famines if we do n't get our way ? 
  that 's not just totally wrong from a morally standpoint , but it does n't even make sense as a migrational policy . 
  if you make their countries worse more people will become economic migrants . 
  lampedusa , pantelleria , sardinia and even sicilia are closer to the african coast than malta . 
  and spain has build fences in africa . 
   just recall what they called orban for doing just that . 
  nothing . 
  contrary to popular believe , orban was never called a nazi . 
  austria 's [ faymann said ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-iduskcn0rc0gl20150912 ) that putting people on trains without telling them that the trains are headed to migrant camps reminded him of nazi germanys deportation policy of not telling people that the trains are headed to concentration camps . 
  other politicians criticised hungary 's fence as a selfish one-sided un-european solution that wo n't be able to help europe because asylum seekers will just choose other routes . 
  plenty politicians criticised hungary 's treatment of asylum seekers and refugees . 
  his policies were criticised . 
  but orban himself was never called anything ( by non-fringe , high ranked politicians ) . 
   polish men still now how to fight if they see a muslim . 
  or someone who looks like a muslim . 
  please go back to your safe space . 
  because there were n't any important politicians on that market . 
  for the official reunification celebrations in dresden they basically surrounded the whole inner city with these : http://i.imgur.com/pyqpchi.jpg, 
  i would have said karak , but that was yesterday already . 
  or aden , but that was the day before yesterday . 
  without actively firing shots germany is pretty involved in the fight against isis . 
  germany arms and trains peshmerga that very successfully fight isis on the ground . 
  germany flies recon jets that identify targets so other members of the anti-isis coalition can bomb them . 
  germanys support has helped killing plenty daesh cutthroats . 
  sweden is part of the coalition that fights isis . 
   `` the purpose of the draft constitutional act is to respond to new security threats intensifying , especially as regards the danger of acts of violence , for example . 
  isolated terrorist attacks , active attackers , respectively . 
  other violent hybrid threats , `` explains his idea interior . 
  i 'm sure dozens of civilians with guns will make active attacker scenarios much easier to handle . 
  especially if the facts about the attacker are so sparse that basically the only description is `` person has a gun '' . 
   what we should do is provide a fast-track citizenship to any uk citizens studying/working/retired in the eu if they have come or planned to do so ( in the case of students ) before the vote itself . 
  why should they be able to skip the queue ? 
  they should get a permanent residence permit in their current country of residence . 
  but that 's it . 
  no fast tracking . 
  no associate membership . 
  just being treated like every other non-eu citizen . 
  if they want citizenship they have to fulfil the same requirements and wait for the same time like every other person . 
   how do other europeans feel about the possibility of this happening ? 
  brits do not deserve special treatment . 
  if eu citizens are not allowed to make use of freedom of movement in the uk , uk citizens should not be allowed to make use of freedom of movement in the eu . 
  even if they pay 25 euro a year for that access . 
  so you want to become the country with the most trade agreements in the world by showing that you ignore agreements when it pleases you because you have a military that is able to defend you ? 
  not according to g\u00f6the . 
  as far as i know that was just an idea thrown around by individual politicians . 
   i was in gb twice , but i did n't enjoy it as much as i would today . 
  like the people i met there were so nice and so talkative ... 
  i just loved it , and then i came back to czech republic and bam . 
  asocial , complexed people with their mainstream job , doing the same thing everyday . 
  they do n't enjoy life . 
  in gb , germany , belgium people seemed so chilled - out relaxed and i do n't know what else . 
  that sounds a lot like the difference between being on vacation and living a normal life . 
  probably big touristy city vs. small town too . 
  when i was 15 i thought like you . 
  when i was 20 i thought like you , and i took the opportunity to live and work in different countries . 
  after three months the initial euphoria died and i realised that life is basically like it was at home . 
  granted , these were all `` western countries '' , so i ca n't invalidate your theory at all . 
  but what i want to say , if you have the opportunity to work or study in another country take it . 
  but there 's a good chance that 10 years from now you 'll live in the czech republic again . 
  good luck . 
   re eurodac - sure . 
  https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/identification-of-applicants_en what i can find on that page contradicts your point . 
  from the site :  until now , the eurodac database could only be used for asylum purposes . 
  ** the new regulation now allows national police forces and europol to compare fingerprints linked to criminal investigations with those contained in eurodac . 
  ** brackets for clarity : they are able to compare ( fingerprints linked to criminal investigations ) with those ( fingerprints contained in eurodac ) . 
  that does not mean that criminal data is saved in eurodac . 
  german police would have been able to query eurodac with fingerprints they found at a site of a terrorist or serious crime . 
  --  if the system designers are somewhat competent , they also designed an ` signal system ' which notifies countries which entered someone in the system that another country ran a match on them . 
  systems designers designed whatever is part of the regulation . 
  as far as i can see informing the country that entered the dataset into the database about matches is not part of the regulation .
