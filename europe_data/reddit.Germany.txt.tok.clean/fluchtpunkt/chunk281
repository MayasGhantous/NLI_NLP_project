  if the european navies would n't actively monitor the shores of africa we would see a lot less drowned people too . 
  that does n't mean they do n't drown , we just would n't see them . 
  nobody knows because the boat operations where the australian navy pulls boats back to the edge of indonesian territorial waters are military operations which are classified . 
  for all we know there could be even more attempts now . 
  that 's just 5 and a half years of # 350 million per week . 
  what would you suggest ? 
  some of the french people really need some english training . 
  they hate us cuz they anus, 
   if you come here to work and contribute , all are welcome . 
  except if you actually come . 
  then the uk tries to curb immigration to 100,000 people per year by not issuing national insurance cards . 
  and once they realise that this does n't work , they ask the eu to limit ** in-work ** benefits , so people from other eu countries no longer want to come , work and contribute . 
  and once they realised that this wo n't be enough to stop them from coming , they voted to leave the eu . 
  and now that they promised to leave , they made immigration a red line . 
  uk media will also blame you for everything bad happening in the country . 
  but besides that , all are welcome . 
  germany has a higher net migration rate of eu citizens than the uk . 
  last year 382,000 more eu citizens came to germany than left . 
  that is higher than the total net migration of the uk , which was 333,000 people in 2015 . economy  language, 
  people always forget about belarus . 
  this has nothing to do with turkey . 
  they know already who the deserters are . 
  you wo n't continue to work for your country if you feel threatened enough to request asylum . 
  not commenting about individuals is more like a general thing . 
  similar to how we do n't have public police reports with mug shots and full names . 
  to steal your jerbs . 
  deep inside these people fear that brexit was n't a good decision . 
  their biggest fear is that the uk suffers post-brexit while the eu flourishes . 
  not triggered, 
  speaking german and having a job that can support your family is a prerequisite to get german citizenship . 
  hello usa , we want to inform you that we have deployed 500 sleeper agents with biological weapons targeting your major cities . 
  sincerley , your friend and close ally germany ps : we 'll only used them if you nuke us pps : hope you still come to my birthday party, 
  maybe these people believed cameron when he stated that he 'll invoke article 50 the moment the referendum results come in ? 
  freedom to assembly . 
  violence is already illegal . 
   in this regard , trump 's children made a very good call by stating that they will not be taking roles in trump 's administration . 
  because that would be against the law . 
  no public official in the us is allowed to hire or promote a relative . 
  maybe you can drain the swamp by overfilling it ? 
  because the only way into europe is the serbian-hungarian border . 
  if it 's implemented like the us visa waiver program , your permit is valid for multiple entries over 2 years . 
  if you have both citizenships when the uk leaves the eu , you will most likely be able to keep both . 
  by law , you have to renounce your old citizenship ** before ** you get german citizenship , except if your other citizenship is from eu or switzerland . 
  renouncing your old citizenship is a requirement to get german citizenship . 
  but once you have german citizenship , germany only cares if you acquire another citizenship . 
  i do n't think there 's anything that says you ca n't have multiple citizenships . 
  there are just laws that say that you have to renounce your other citizenships before getting german citizenship , and that you automatically lose your german citizenship if you acquire another citizenship . 
  disclaimer : not a lawyer, 
  the uk has to leave the eu so they can get the people they need to leave the eu . 
   the legality of such a measure is a topic for itself too . 
  not at all . 
  at least not in the case of germany . 
  a eu army is no german army . 
  hence , no involvement of the german parliament needed . 
  the responsibilities of the german parliament in regards to gg 87a do n't extend to german citizens . 
  the parliament decides about deployments of the german army , not about german citizen who became eu soldiers . 
  and i thought 2016 could n't get worse . 
  please stop embarrassing yourself . 
  the ebrd created the `` chernobyl shelter fund '' in 1997 . 
  since then around 40 countries and organizations have contributed 1.3 billion euro . 
  the ebrd to date contributed 500 million $ of its own resources to bridge that funding gap . 
  just move to the uk before article 50 is invoked and you have a very very high chance of getting permanent residency in the uk . 
  which should make you eligible to acquire uk citizenship in a couple years . 
   why did germany sign up to it then ? 
  because security was different back then ? 
  in 1989 west-germany spend 2.7 % of its gdp on defence . 
  nato seems to disagree . 
  deployment sizes changed during the war so we have to pick a date arbitrarily . 
  i 'll choose [ 25 october 2010 ] ( http://www.nato.int/isaf/placemats_archive/2010-10-25-isaf-placemat.pdf ) . 
  troops deployed under isaf by ( current ) eu country : - austria 3 - belgium 491 - bulgaria 516 - croatia 300 - czechia 468 - denmark 750 - estonia 136 - finland 150 - france 3750 - germany 4388 - greece 80 - hungary 507 - ireland 7 - italy 3300 - latvia 155 - lithuania 220 - luxembourg 9 - netherlands 380 - poland 2417 - portugal 26 - romania 1648 - slovakia 300 - slovenia 72 - spain 1537 - sweden 500 - uk 9500 feel free to pick another date to show that denmark contributed significantly more than germany , france or italy : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/107995.htm -- and here 's the current ( as of july 2016 ) deployment for resolute support mission : http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_07/20160707_2016-07-rsm-placemat.pdf, 
  why should n't it ? 
  germanys gdp was 3025 billion euro in 2015 . 
  2 % of that would be 60.5 billion euro . 
  all revenue of federal germany in 2015 combined was 311.7 billion euro . 
  defence spending would be 19.4 % of that . 
  but revenue from taxes was just 282.1 billion euro . 
  defence budget would have been 21.4 % of all taxes collected by the federal government . 
  -- sources : ministry of finance , federal budget : https://www.bundeshaushalt-info.de/#/2015/ist/einnahmen/gruppe.html statista , gdp : https://www.statista.com/statistics/295444/germany-gross-domestic-product/, 
   the amount of money that is spent on military should be determined by the needs of the national army then these countries should leave nato . 
  they can then decide how much money should be spend themselves . 
  nato is a defence alliance . 
  every member has to contribute to the collective defence . 
  and all nato members have agreed that 2 % of gdp is a reasonable level of spending . 
  yet western europe does n't care , because they do n't need it . 
  because the us will stop russia in countries east of them . 
   the nato should demand a number of troops for common missions instead this ( not mandatory ) 2 % spending . 
  then you have to convince the enemy that they announce an attack 10 years in advance . 
  nato is a defence alliance , there are no mandatory missions where members have to deploy troops . 
  or you do n't use it at all for 25 years . 
  like in the case of the castle . 
  it may have been feasible in communism to move things to castles even if it would be much cheaper to construct a new building . 
  it no longer is . 
  depends on the question . 
  if the question is which country pays the agreed nato share the absolute defence budgets do n't matter . 
  if the question is which country would be more helpful in an scenario where nato is actually attacked it is . 
   it 's easy to say , `` spend more for this nato thing of ours '' when all the money goes to this thing of yours , the mighty american defense contractor business almost every military technology is available from european arms companies already , or can be developed by them . 
  clutching at straws . 
  the idea that rich uk citizens could continue to profit from freedom of movement in the eu , while not so rich eu citizens would be barred from doing the same in the uk wo n't go down too well with the electorate . 
  uk citizens who currently reside in the eu should receive permanent residence permits . 
  but should otherwise be treated like nationals from non-eu/eea/switzerland countries .
