  only if you are okay with having weapons in your venue . 
  in many venues security is checking woman 's handbags . 
  and they have been doing that for decades . 
  it 's hard to find more details about the moments before the attack , but according to [ vice ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/this-is-what-happened-at-the-bataclan-concert-hall-during-the-paris-attacks ) this is what happened :  at 9:40 pm , nearly 30 minutes into the eagles of death metal set , three attackers stormed the building and began firing into the crowd . 
    two of the six security agents on duty that night were stationed at the main door , and they rushed to open up the emergency exits when the first shots rang out . 
  `` didi , '' who was overseeing security at the bataclan , told french daily le monde that the attackers fired at the security team and shattered the glass windows in the entrance of the hall . 
  it sounds like a `` whites only '' sign would have been as helpful as a `` no assault rifles '' sign . 
  because they stormed the venue without waiting for permission to enter . 
  the concert was sold out , so unless they had tickets , they would n't have been allowed to enter regardless of signs . 
   ( the part of germany that generally has the least refugees btw ) obviously . 
  because asylum seekers are distributed by applying the k\u00f6nigsteiner schl\u00fcssel . 
  which calculates how much each state has to contribute to common projects . 
  that calculation factors in tax income ( 2/3 ) and population ( 1/3 ) . 
  if we have the least refugees it 's because we are the least rich and the least populous . 
  how many would still be alive if the bataclan would have banned people with assault rifles and hand grenades ? 
   you ca n't deny that night clubs discriminate based on gender . 
  why do n't they get sued and closed ? 
  just because night clubs do that does n't mean that they allowed to do it . 
  the rights to reject people are very limited . 
  you can certainly reject people because they do n't follow the theme of your party . 
  if you have a `` over 30 '' party you do n't have to let people in that are n't 30 . 
  you can also reject people because you have the strong suspicion that someone will cause trouble , for example because someone has caused trouble before . 
  you can also reject people because they are intoxicated . 
  you can of course stop letting people in because the club is full already . 
  but rejecting based on gender is definitely not allowed . 
  and rejecting based on ethnicity is n't either . 
  here 's a [ case ( german ) ] ( https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?gericht=ag%20bremen&amp;datum=20.01.2011&amp;aktenzeichen=25%20c%20278%2f10 ) where a group tried to enter a club . 
  one of the group was denied entry . 
  he sued the club , and claimed that the doorman rejected him because of his skin color . 
  the club argued that he was rejected because his clothing style was not appropriate for the event . 
  the court followed the plaintiff . 
  so the club was in violation of the anti discrimination act , and had to pay 300 $ to the plaintiff . 
  in another [ case ] ( https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?text=10%20u%20106/11 ) a club hat to compensate a guy with 900 $ because they rejected him with the words `` there are already enough blacks '' . 
  and it would have another [ case ] ( https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?gericht=ag%20hannover&amp;datum=14.08.2013&amp;aktenzeichen=462%20c%2010744%2f12 ) , 1000 $ for a kurdish-german because `` male foreigners were unwelcome '' . 
  if the club rejects entry to him again without valid reason the club can be fined with up to 250,000 $ . 
  another [ one ] ( https://dejure.org/dienste/vernetzung/rechtsprechung?gericht=ag%20hannover&amp;datum=26.11.2015&amp;aktenzeichen=549%20c%2012993%2f14 ) , and again 1000 $ of compensation for a dark skinned german with migration background . 
  from now on , only people who are allowed in east german fitness centers should be allowed to post on this sub . 
  fake news !, 
  we are just concerned citizens with a xenophobic background . 
  the eu will tread very carefully in that area . 
  because getting rid of asylum seekers is n't its only foreign policy . 
  if we start to use methods that we are criticising when other countries are using them we 'll lose a lot of soft power . 
  good luck convincing countries that diplomacy and cooperation is the way forward when we rely on threats and various levels of gunboat diplomacy to make countries do what we want . 
  they are n't ferrying them to europe , they are ferrying them to italy . 
  countries like ireland , the uk or germany would have stopped participating a long time ago if the people they rescue would become their responsibility . 
  how do you figure out who 's a genuine refugee without checking their asylum applications ? 
  you do n't actually qualify for asylum just because you flee from a country at war . 
  so comparing their citizenship with a list of countries that are at war wo n't suffice . 
  it will be incredibly boring , because you wo n't see collusion on them . 
  and they will say that the ngos stop colluding with smugglers when they are there to film . 
  when you lease land you do that for a specific purpose . 
  change that purpose and you will lose your lease very quickly . 
  basically all north african countries have made it clear that they have no interest in becoming an asylum seekers dump for the eu . 
  what a coincidence that the only material they receive can be described as being in the interest of a certain country . 
  almost like their sources are n't whistleblowers but government sponsored hackers . 
  i for one am still waiting for that leak on corruption in russian business that assange announced in [ 2010 ] ( https://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2010/1026/wikileaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-russia.-but-will-russians-get-to-read-about-it ) . 
  ca n't wait until they finally make their announcement true to target `` despotic regimes in china , russia , and central asia '' in a series of fresh document dumps . 
   i 'm sure if they had something on le pen , they would publish it . 
  totally . 
  for some reason they never seem to receive anything work leaking about the russian government , or parties that are aligned with the russian government . 
  i ca n't recall any laws that prevent you from sending people to countries which uphold human rights and which uphold the right to asylum . 
  for practical reasons the destination countries should agree to take them though . 
  the eu will certainly not change the laws so you can send people back to current day libya . 
  because that would mean to abolish the un refugee convention . 
  under the convention there are absolutely no requirements to request asylum . 
  everyone has the right to request asylum if they are on the soil of another country . 
  not even orban et al. 
  are suggesting to abolish the un refugee convention . 
  we ca n't . 
  because nobody wants to play the roles of indonesia and papua new guinea for us . 
  the eu-turkey deal is like a light version of the australian solution . 
   but not at the expense of the european economy absolutely . 
  i think in that regard it 's remarkable that the 28 eu countries could agree on sanctions at all . 
  poland wanted to sell apples to russia . 
  hungary wanted to get some military tech from russia . 
  italy wanted to sell military vehicles to russia . 
  germany wanted to sell everything . 
  and basically everyone wanted to buy gas . 
  many people even doubted that the eu could agree on sanctions . 
  and when the sanctions are about to be prolonged everyone seems to believe that this time there 'll be a member that will veto the prolongation . 
  in principle the eu sanctions are also supposed to hurt companies that either profit from or help with the invasion of ukraine . 
  though i 'm not sure if that theme was the actual intent of the sanctions or if they came up with it after they figured out what can be sanctioned without causing harm in our economies . 
  we 're willing to sanction russia , but not in areas where it would really hurt them . 
  if you want to teach russia a lesson you ca n't exclude the energy trade from the sanctions . 
  the current sanctions do n't seem to achieve their goal . 
  but stopping or limiting energy trade is not an option that any eu nation would pursue . 
  because putting limits on it , e.g. 
  no increase , or even a annual decrease , will turn energy trade into a political weapon and there 's the large risk that russia might answer with `` nope . 
  you 'll buy 100 % less this year '' . 
  and without russian gas our economies will take a massive hit . 
  it might not be the same as chamberlain 's appeasement . 
  but it 's pretty comparable . 
  we avoid doing what would be right because we do n't want to bear the cost . 
  but is n't everything that is n't a full embargo appeasement ? 
  well the crime statistics certainly show an increase in crime . 
  and asylum seekers are generally overrepresented in violent , property and sexual crimes . 
  due to media reporting perceived crime among these groups is even worse . 
  but even the actual increase does n't make cities unsafe . 
  they mean that the decrease in crime has reverted and we are back to where we were a couple years ago . 
  since they are always mentioned let 's look at crimes against sexual self determination .
