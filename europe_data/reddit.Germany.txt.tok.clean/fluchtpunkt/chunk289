  in 2016 we registered 47,401 cases , a 3 % increase from 46,081 cases in 2015 ( 2014 : 46,982 , 2013 : 46,793 , 2012 : 45,824 ) . 
  the number of suspects grew from 32,079 in 2015 to 33,533 in 2016 , a 5 % increase . 
  but we went from 6,592 non-german suspects in 2015 to 8,698 non-german suspects , which is a stunning 32 % increase . 
  so how much did the risk increase to become victim of a crime against sexual self determination ? 
  in absolute numbers we 're still a bit lower than the 2009 level ( 49,084 cases ) . 
  where people afraid of going out in 2009 ? 
  how about 2004 where we registered 57,306 cases ? 
  i do n't know . 
  with sexual crimes there 's another factor one should take into account . 
  when you compare cases perpetrated by asylum seekers to cases by other residents one will probably notice that the victims are different . 
  contrary to popular believe a lot if not most sexual crimes are n't committed against random people . 
  they are perpetrated against acquaintances , friends , subordinates or even family . 
  it 's safe to assume that the number of random victims among sexual crimes committed by asylum seekers is much higher than it is in the general population . 
  cynical speaking the risk of getting raped in your own home has decreased while the risk of getting raped in the city center has increased disclaimer : these are suspects , not convicted . 
  a suspect is a person that was suspected of having perpetrated the crime when the police closed the investigation . 
  the sole accusation of someone does not make them a suspect . 
  people who were suspects of multiple crimes of the same category in the same year are only counted once . 
  and registered cases , not cases that lead to a conviction . 
  due to the number of unreported cases crime statistics should not be taken at face value . 
  increases in registered cases could just mean that people are more likely to report their cases . 
  -- but the majority of asylum seekers are n't criminals . 
  since many of them fall into the category of being young , male and from macho cultures they tend to be annoying as fuck though . 
  i 'm from a small city in saxony , we do n't have muslim majority areas . 
  the asylum seekers are basically the only muslims that live here . 
  unfortunately we have many tunisians and other nationalities who have no chance for asylum , they tend to behave much worse than syrians for example . 
  the young ones are always hanging around in the city center ( free wifi ) and look for people who want to play a game of `` why are you looking at me '' with them . 
  but that 's for the most just talk . 
  and annoying music . 
  before 2015 the trouble seekers we had were alcoholics and crystal meth victims . 
  now we have asylum seekers too . 
  but as i said , they are mostly just talk , like the alcoholics . 
  the meth users on the other hand ... 
  thankfully in germany consensus based governing works quite well on all political levels . 
  the coalitions certainly help to make germany stable and predictable . 
  if a party wants to enact a law they always have to find other parties that agree with it . 
  that 's why we only have very few laws that are repealed after the government changes . 
  the nuclear phase-out would be such an example . 
  naturally that means that things move slower . 
  with the grand coalitions one could even say they lead to stagnation in certain areas . 
  one can see that with gay marriage . 
  spd had that on their agenda for quite some time . 
  but when they were in a grand coalitions with the cdu they did n't actually work towards that goal . 
  because in their coalition agreement they agreed that gay marriage wo n't happen during the current legislature period . 
  personally i prefer slow moving grand coalitions over fast moving governments who start their legislation period with repealing laws the previous government enacted . 
  sounds like yet another article where people who do n't live in germany try to explain the situation in germany . 
   some elderly german friends recently whispered into my ear : `` we do n't dare to go into the city centre anymore , there is just so much crime . '', 
  and they of course have to whisper that . 
  because there 's no freedom of speech in germany . 
  am i right . 
   herr merkel will be re-elected but might have to rely on others to keep her in power . 
  it 's frau merkel . 
  in germany parties usually ca n't govern without a coalition . 
  every party since 1949 has governed with a coalition partner . 
  there was only one election where a party could have governed without a partner , that was in 1957 . 
  the chancellor is elected by the parliament , not by the electorate . 
  which means that merkel definitely has to rely on others to stay chancellor . 
  cdu wo n't win 50 % +1 of the seats . 
  do n't they have phones in poland ? 
  yeah . 
  we have to suffer under horrible 3.8 %, 
  many nato countries are in nato because they could n't defend themselves sufficiently if they were alone . 
  at that point they have already surrendered territorial sovereignty to nato . 
  if nato announces that your country is no longer under the protection your territorial sovereignty might be under actual threat . 
  nato soldiers crossing borders freely during manoeuvres does n't threaten your sovereignty . 
  the status quo is already that soldiers crossing borders are n't systematically checked on an individual base . 
  nato announces their plans to the local authorities a few weeks in advance and then they usually get the green light for crossing the border . 
  without customs officials inspecting vehicles or checking the ids of people . 
  not sure what you mean with blind trust . 
  if they want to invade you bureaucracy wo n't stop them . 
  i doubt that there are many people who use formats that differ from the ones used in their countries . 
  i 'll try to provide the `` correct '' results . 
  this was created by code based on the macos locale . 
  i expect that for some regional languages at least the date format is wrong . 
  the locale may default to the iso standard ymd if it does n't know the actual date format used . 
  for the official languages it 's probably correct .

  the german army is already training in poland regularly . 
  and yes , if german troops move to the baltics they tend to move through poland too . 
  but of course they would have been denied entry if they had answered the question at the border checkpoint differently . 
  http://i.imgur.com/9phuaz8.png fun fact : world war 2 would have never happened if countries would have had mandatory border checks for the military . 
  the only reason why germany managed to invade other countries was because back then we had a schengen zone for the military in europe . 
   so we are supposed to allow free and largely undocumented pass of foreign army through europe because ? 
  because you are in a defence alliance with them ? 
   you know the soviets gave exactly the same justification for occupation of czechoslovakia in 1968 ? 
  let 's say it like this . 
  slovakian border guards wo n't prevent nato from occupying you . 
  if nato would want to occupy you they would just ignore any obligations about customs checks . 
  how it is reported is important as well . 
  what they highlight from another leak :  special prosecutor robert muelller flew to moscow and gave the fsb 10 grams of highly enriched uranium ( heu ) in 2009   https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/891431096688271365 what they leave out , you have to dig into the leak itself to find :  2 . 
  ( s/nf ) background : ** over two years ago russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium ( heu ) seized in early 2006 in georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one russian national and several georgian accomplices . 
  ** the seized heu was transferred to u.s. custody and is being held at a secure doe facility . 
  in response to the russian request , the georgian government authorized the united states to share a sample of the material with the russians for forensic analysis .
