  you too are only believing what you want to believe . 
  you are not the free thinker you think you are . 
  no matter how often you scream ` fake news ' . 
  i thought they come to europe to get welfare ? 
  and i 'm a third tier citizen . 
  i have a passion for biological weapons . 
  no free country for me . 
  every country wants to interfere with my passion . 
  the problem will be to get it from iraq into the eu . 
  uk is not part of the schengen area , they also have an opt-out from common immigration policy , they do n't have to let in asylum seekers and refugees . 
  the only people the uk ca n't stop at their border are eu/eea/swiss citizen . 
   well , the relocated folks will just return to germany anyways . 
  and when apprehended , germany will return them to slovakia . 
  getting benefits is a bureaucratic process that requires you to prove your identity and your status . 
  which the asylum seeker wo n't be able to , because he has no residence permit for germany . 
  hence , no benefits . 
  if the authorities are smart they will involve the police in that moment . 
  then the police tries to figure out who that person is and what their status is . 
  at some point the police will enter the fingerprints into the system , either because the migrant refuses to cooperate in determining their identity and status , or because the migrant says the magic words `` i want asylum '' . 
  if the fingerprints are checked , an alert from eurodac should come up that informs the police that slovakia is responsible for the case . 
  germany will then request a relocation with slovakia . 
  if slovakia agrees ( which they will ) , the asylum seeker either gets a train ticket back to slovakia , or he 'll be brought to slovakia in handcuffs . 
  for some context . 
  slovakia is expected to relocate a total of 902 persons from italy and/or greece . 
  what terrorist attacks are you looking at to come to that conclusion ? 
  the recent ones in europe were either completely random , or they targeted police , guards or soldiers . 
  warning people that they are among `` the first to go '' does n't make any sense if you are talking about random attacks against civilians . 
  that was definitely a threat . 
  the extreme right loves to tell people that they `` will be the first to go '' . 
  i have been told that i 'll be among the first who will put up against the wall multiple times in real life . 
  the first time was with 15 in school , when i held a presentation that disproved the favourite talking points of the class-nazi . 
  -- here 's the complete ( as per [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_terrorism_in_europe_\\ ( 2014 -- present \\ ) ) list of islamic attacks in the eu this year . 
  - a machete attack at the louvre ** injured one soldier ** as well as the attacker . 
  - a man was killed by soldiers patrolling orly airport as part of op\u00e9ration sentinelle after he ** attempted to seize a female soldier 's gun ** . 
  - 52-year old khalid masood drove a car into pedestrians on westminster bridge - a hijacked truck was driven into pedestrians along a shopping street before crashing into a department store . 
  - ** three police officers and a bystander were shot ** by an attacker wielding an ak-47 rifle on the champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es , a shopping boulevard in paris . 
  - a suicide bombing was carried out at manchester arena after a concert by american singer ariana grande , killing 22 civilians . 
  - a van ran over multiple pedestrians on the london bridge . 
  - a lone wolf who had pledged allegiance to isil in a video carrying knives in his rucksack ** attacked an officer guarding notre dame ** de paris with a hammer . 
  - a car containing guns and explosives ** rammed into a police vehicle ** on the champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es . 
  - a terrorist ran into brussels central station , where he detonated a small bomb which caused no injuries . 
  still carrying a suicide vest , he ran to another part of the station . 
  there he was shot and killed by soldiers who where guarding the station . 
  - one person was killed and six were seriously injured when a man shouting `` allahu akbar '' stabbed civilians in a supermarket in hamburg . 
   look up some allied propaganda from the wwii , you will see that they depicted `` japs '' as human-sized rats etc. 
  of course they did . 
  otherwise there would have been way more dissent against rounding them up in camps . 
   it is unfortunately a part of the whole killing business . 
  people kill other people easier if they convince themselves that they are not really human . 
  but that 's the point . 
  if states stop to apply human rights because there are people who are no longer humans we 're not far away from camps . 
  maybe just internment camps , maybe extermination camps . 
  when you cease to be human , do you become a subhuman ? 
   shocker , and people thought it could n't be done . 
  who said that ? 
  i do n't watch 15 minutes videos of things that would probably fit into a 500 word article . 
  that 's why i 'm asking if she just read the tweet of ` defend europe ' without offering anything new besides her opinion and the usual rants about ( ( ( soros ) ) ) and his ngos that run the world . 
   why is there a large-scale attempt of sabotaging the mission when its only purpose is to monitor ngo activities and make sure there is no illegal human trafficking going on ? 
  first one has to prove that there 's an coordinated attempt of sabotage , i.e. 
  one has to show that the people that have asked authorities to inspect the ship are organised . 
  maybe they are just pro-refugee people who handled on their own . 
  next thing would be to show if and how a ngo can be capable of such covert operations . 
  the sailors that requested asylum in northern cyprus were supposed to leave the ship in egypt . 
  the ship did not intent to sail to northern cyprus . 
  how did the ngos know that there would still be sailors aboard which could be bribed into requesting asylum ? 
  how did the ngos manage to file agents to norther cyprus that quickly ? 
  how did the ngo agent identify the sailors at the airport ? 
  how did the sailors book their flights ? 
  did they book them theirselves , or was it done by the captain ? 
  will the authorities release information about that ? 
  does she answer these questions in the video ? 
  did she read their tweet into the camera ? 
   dm would be much stronger than the euro . 
  meaning the goods that germany exports would be much more expensive . 
  and basically everyone in germany would be totally okay with it . 
  because we could finally vacation like kings again . 
  many did n't even bother to exchange currencies when on vacation . 
  most shops and restaurants in southern and eastern europe were happy to get their hands on some deutsche mark . 
   frankly , i dont see the `` sacrifice '' . 
  germany did n't want the euro . 
  germany accepted the euro against the advise of its experts and against the will of its population . 
  france and others thought they can impede the german economy with a common currency . 
  did n't work out as intended . 
  and now lets rewrite history and tell everyone that germany forced everyone into the eurozone so they can exploit them . 
  because germany loves nothing more than a weak currency . 
  you 're right . 
  i missed that . 
  the vote is primarily symbolic . 
  it has been known for quite some time that hungary intents to veto procedures against poland in return for a veto in case there are procedures against hungary . 
   the eu executive decided on wednesday to start legal action against poland for violating the bloc 's law , but had to wait until poland officially published the new law to send a letter to warsaw . 
  makes you appreciate living in a country under the rule of law . 
  --  one such case centers on sevan ni\u015fanyan , an ethnic armenian writer and public intellectual who criticized the government 's attempts to prohibit criticism of the prophet muhammad . 
  ni\u015fanyan has been in prison since january 2014 based on an earlier conviction for violating the code of protection of cultural and national properties by undertaking construction on his own property ; [ 96 ] ** he is currently the only person imprisoned in turkey for violating the code ** . 
  [ 97 ] he faces further time behind bars in several pending cases on charges such as `` disrespecting the religious belief of a group , '' under article 216 of the criminal code . 
  other charges stem from posts on his personal blog about the armenian genocide , and about atat\u00fcrk , whom the writer described as a `` fascist dictator . ''   https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2015/turkey, 
   then again , this does n't necessarily have to be the case , if we only allowed legal immigrants in . 
  asylum seekers are legal immigrants when they enter a country with the intent of requesting asylum . 
  that 's like the basic point of the refugee convention . 
  because we want to prevent situations like they happened in many countries during the holocaust . 
  for example switzerland rejected a couple thousand jews from germany at their border , because they had no right to enter .
