  these are basically the countries that oppose a mandatory quota . 
  because they are n't affected . 
  yet . 
  once the west balkan route is closed , asylum seekers wo n't stay at home . 
  they will switch to the bulgaria - romania - hungary route . 
  if austria keeps their border tight , sooner or later people might try to reach germany/sweden via slovakia - czech republic ( - poland ) . 
  it wo n't take long and the opposing countries come back to the table to have a meaningful discussion about short and long term solutions . 
  until now everyone who was n't directly affected , pretended that its not their problem . 
  and i believe that is about to change . 
   germany and eu will set quotas anyhow , for eu countries and candidates alike , there is no need for any additional tension about this . 
  i doubt that . 
  not over the heads of the opposing countries . 
  besides all the threats . 
  it 's either a unanimous decision or no decision . 
  and it looks like we just have to wait until the mandatory quota gets attractive for more countries . 
  slovenia and croatia will soon be among the loudest supporters of a mandatory and probably even unlimited quota . 
  slovenia would have received 1050 asylum seekers in the second quarter of 2015 . 
  shit needs to hit the fan first . 
  common eu problem . 
  probably common everywhere problem . 
  as long as the refugees are not on our doorstep it 's not our problem . 
  do n't pretend that you are overwhelmed my friend in another part of the eu . 
  it 's just refugees . 
  when they are there . 
  help !, 
  we are overwhelmed . 
  then they have changed their opinion recently . 
   brussels , 14 september - slovenia is expected to advocate solidarity between member states but also voluntary quotas as eu ministers in charge of home affairs hold a ministerial in brussels on monday dedicated to the refugee crisis . 
  it wo n't . 
  but it will relief some pressure from the system so the whole eu can work on a mid - and long-term solution . 
  they were in favor of a voluntary quota system . 
  also known as `` we are small country , we can only take 10 refugees per year '' . 
   slovenia set out its case against binding quotas on eu member states in accepting refugees arriving in the bloc via the mediterranean from crisis regions in northern africa and the middle east , as interior minister vesna gy\u00f6rk\u00f6s \u017dnidar took part in a eu ministerial in luxembourg on tuesday . 
    '' ** solidarity needs to be voluntary ** and has to consider the capabilities of our country and specific limitations , '' said the slovenian minister as the ministers opened a debate on the european commission 's proposal for burden sharing in the refugee crisis . 
   http://www.sloveniatimes.com/slovenia-opposed-to-binding-refugee-quotas-in-eu, 
  international law requires that every single asylum application has to be thoroughly checked for their validity . 
  generally the only exception is if you can prove that a person is from a safe country . 
  in that case you can return them with a way quicker procedure . 
  that 's what the us does with people who entered illegally via mexico . 
  so if it 's not clear from which country someone is you get in the experts and you have them examine the applicant . 
  but of course you ca n't deport them if you do n't know their nationality . 
  in my opinion we need a solution that equals a unhcr style refugee camp for people who refuse to cooperate to determine the nationality . 
  sure thing . 
  germany had 200,000 asylum seekers last year . 
  this year , before merkels statement , we had 250,000 . 
  around 20 % of these were syrians . 
  but yeah , merkel basically started the bloody mess with her statement 4 weeks ago . 
  -- the statistics daily mail mentions are the [ q2/2015 eu asylum statistics ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6996925/3-18092015-bp-en.pdf/b0377f79-f06d-4263-aa5b-cc9b4f6a838f ) that were released today . 
  magic merkel causes an influx in q2 with a statement in late august . 
  agree on mandatory quotas , so there will only be a fraction of these people in your country . 
  i give it until the end of next week and slovenia will beg for a mandatory quota system . 
  if the asylum seekers are at your doorstep , hosting only 0.5 % of the people that enter does n't sound that bad anymore . 
  that would only be 1050 for the second quarter of 2015 . 
  if only there were a mandatory quota system so slovenia could deal with way less people in such a short time . 
  the eu needs a common fiscal policy . 
  we need an eu tax law . 
  and we need an eu tax authority . 
  because the us is a lot more than a transfer union . 
  transfer union without common policy is pointless . 
  otherwise germany could lower its taxes to 0 % and at the yearly meeting they request more money from the other members . 
  slovenia made a decision already . 
   `` solidarity needs to be voluntary and has to consider the capabilities of our country and specific limitations , '' said the slovenian minister as the ministers opened a debate on the european commission 's proposal for burden sharing in the refugee crisis . 
  that was published june 16 2015 . http://www.sloveniatimes.com/slovenia-opposed-to-binding-refugee-quotas-in-eu funny how fast things are changing . 
  no need for solidarity if you do n't expect asylum seekers . 
  asylum seekers come ? 
  please help . 
  infrastructure , housing and staff ( teachers , immigration officers , or simply police that can redirect the flow ) are most likely much bigger problems . 
  context : merkel spoke at an election rally for the mayor of stuttgart . 
  this was on ** october 12 , 2012 ** . 
  some of the people that booed her , did hold up posters against [ stuttgart 21 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuttgart_21 ) . 
  which was the actual reason for the protest , not the current refugee situation as it is implied by posting that video today . 
  here 's a german article about this incident : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/wahlkampf-stuttgarter-empfangen-merkel-mit-pfeifkonzert-a-861071.html source for the video to proof the context : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saljmqodlqi, 
  this obviously needs long term commitment . 
  50 years at least . 
  and we need mandatory quotas over that timespan . 
  otherwise it 'll be just used until the current situation is under control i think something like this could work : 1 . 
  the eu pays a reasonable part of the budget of the unhcr . 
  50 % or whatever . 
  the eu creates a infrastructure task force ( think thw and similar agencies ) that are on their way if unhcr requests it . 
  we basically pledge to build refugee camps if the un needs them . 
  we agree to resettle a set amount of refugees per year . 
  let it be 100,000 a year . 
  even over 50 years , the eu would be able to manage 100,000 refugees per year . 
  in return the unhcr allows us to relocate asylum seekers to their camps . 
  that would help europe because pull factors like the german job market do n't matter anymore . 
  instead of economic migrants that behave like entitled assholes we get people who are actually in need of protection and help . 
  it 's very likely that the unhcr would love such a solution . 
  they know very well that letting refugees move to countries of their choosing is not a good solution . 
  and they know very well how hard it is to find support , be it financial or expertise if shit hits the fan . 
  we can offer that support . 
  the eu is the biggest economy in the world . 
  we have money . 
  and we also have some of the best engineers in the world . 
  refugees everywhere would profit from such a cooperation . 
  the problem is that this will never happen , because maybe we could safe money if we build higher fences and pray that the influx stops . 
  as you said , nobody gives a fuck about refugees unless they are already on your front porch . 
  but nowadays all these things are n't done with thousands of workers . 
  you have 10 engineers and 50 skilled workers who run the machinery . 
  maybe need one or two unskilled workers to get beer and lunch . 
   how do you decide who is allowed to come here though ?
