  yes , that requires a fair trial . 
  obviously . 
  i like the first part of the company profile for walmart . 
   earlier this year , walmart ceo doug mcmillon kicked off his company 's biannual sustainability milestone meeting by showing off a new , improved bottle of detergent : the purex powershot . 
  ** developed by walmart with the manufacturer , henkel ** , the product uses less water and is 30 % more efficient and 50 % more effective than the old version , but costs the same , mcmillon said . 
  partnering to create a better product is a process walmart can replicate `` hundreds of thousands of times over again , '' he said . 
  my city ( in saxony , germany ) runs a decentralized housing project , and a couple refugee families are living in my direct vicinity . 
  some are from war-torn countries like syria or iraq , some are the classic economic migrants from kosovo or serbia . 
  two years ago we had almost no refugees in the city . 
  now they make up a good 1 % of the population . 
  but you generally wo n't notice them if you do n't look for them . 
  i guess that 's the advantage of decentralized housing ... 
  i do n't seek contact to them , so i can only tell things about the people that are my direct neighbors . 
  -- one thing i learned rather quickly is that i ca n't stand groups of refugee teenagers . 
  they are loud , listen to shitty music and they annoy others with their presence . 
  they are basically german teenagers that speak a different language . 
  if the syrian teenager boy from next door is alone he actually seems quite nice . 
  though he does not know how to fix his shitty third-hand bike . 
  so he often asks me if i can help . 
  and he listens to questionable music . 
  and by that i mean german hiphop . 
  just last week he asked me if i know who the babo is . 
  and then he made fun of me because he thought i 'm way to old to know stuff like that . 
  and the little ( ~ 5 years ) syrian girls that live next door are the worst . 
  they sometimes sneak up to people and then they say `` hallo '' ( that 's german for `` as-salamu alaykum '' ) in their cute voices . 
  and then they run away giggling . 
  they literally hide in the bushes and wait until somebody walks by . 
  then they jump out and greet them . 
  horrible . 
  i think these refugees are almost like real people . 
   a pack of cigarettes used to be 5 dm , now it 's 5 euros . 
  and that 's obviously the fault of the euro . 
  not the german tobacco tax increase of 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2004 , 2005 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , 2014 and 2015 . 
  earning money ? 
  i was talking about the german id , the personalausweis . 
  cloning the passport rfid is pretty much pointless because the access key is printed on the inside of the passport . 
  so you have to clone the rfid chip and produce a matching passport . 
  in that case you could just give the other person your passport . 
   absurdly insecure because of the guy that could access the data that is saved on the chip after only 4 hours of constant contact with the rfid chip ? 
  and he only needed 4 hours because he knew the birth data of the person . 
  without that he would have needed 4 hours for every try . 
  or because of the clones that nobody cares about because it 's useless to clone the passport chip because you have to create a fitting physical passport ? 
  the encryption of the rfid part of the german id has not been broken . 
  democracy does not mean that you can decide how others spend their money . 
   the problem is that you can read them up to 2 meters away and also make duplicates of the rfid chip in them .

  but i do n't see a reason why that should have changed in 2015 . 
  it 's nazi gold . 
  it 's obvious who is the rightful owner . 
  switzerland . 
  it helps to distinguish between sex and romantic relationships . 
  there are plenty of people who are only interested in hetero-romantic relationships that phantasize about or actually practice non-hetero sexuality . 
  or maybe people actually have phantasies about non-hetero sex . 
  the un is busy managing refugee camps that host millions of people . 
  i would be truly ashamed if the eu would ask the un for help . 
  you would n't pass our integration test , depicted in this video , anyway . 
  australia sends these boats back to indonesia , which is a safe country . 
  we ca n't do that because libya is not a safe country . 
  so who is going to be our papua new guinea or nauru ? 
  that 's where australia brings people that ca n't be send back to indonesia . 
  -- and to compare the scale of australia 's operation let me quote australian immigration minister peter dutton :  `` the fact that today we celebrate that we have not had a successful people smuggling venture in a year , and that over the course of the last 18 months or so we have turned back 20 boats and stopped 633 people from arriving in our country , is a significant achievement , '' [ source ] ( http://thejakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/news/australia-reveals-600-asylum-seekers-turned-back-sea/ ) so they stopped 633 people in 18 months . 
  in the last 18 months hundred-thousands of asylum seekers came to europe . 
  if australia would be where italy is their `` strategy '' would not work . 
  so what do you suggest ? 
  drain the mediterranean sea so we can build a 10 meter high concrete wall ? 
  they are free to leave that union of craziness . 
  dae hate it when human rights undermine our european values ? 
  we should just rename the european union . 
  `` european club to share sunshine , lollipops and rainbows . 
  and military protection for the east '' seems more fitting . 
  and because of the first part we already have an anthem for the ecslr . 
  of course . 
  we proud europeans have to show the world our important european values . 
  yes, 
   i would feel a lot better if the people coming here did something like a civil service program where they did construction/work around the country in exchange for basic healthcare and housing , as well as canteen/food services . 
  yes . 
  my dad would love to be fired because his 10 $ an hour job is now done by an asylum seeker for free . 
  awesome idea . 
  i know , i know . 
  you 'll implement the same rules that we had with 1 $ jobs . 
  those that lead to my dad being fired and replaced by some long-term unemployed who worked for 1.50 $ on top of his unemployment benefits . 
   the war in syria will likely be done in 2 years i lol 'd, 
  66.6 % the share of male people who requested asylum in germany in [ 2014 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/publikationen/broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  my idea is that it 's stupid to blame refugees for low wages . 
  because eu immigration is more than enough to keep wages low . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  germany is a constitutional state . 
  and asylum seekers have the right to appeal the decision . 
  if nobody appears the verdict is decided in absence . 
  can confirm . 
  my city runs a decentralized housing project . 
  so i live in the middle of a couple refugee families . 
  the biggest complaint my german neighbors have about them is the lack of m\u00fclltrennung . 
  these bastards throw their regular trash in our gelbe tonne !!, 
  germans and their love for m\u00fcllhandling should really be the first lesson in the integration courses they attend . 
   ( except backblaze , which is american but offers full encryption ) . 
  conveniently they store the private key that is used to decrypt the data on their servers .
