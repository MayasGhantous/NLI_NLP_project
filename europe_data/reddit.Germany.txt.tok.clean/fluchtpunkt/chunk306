  he 's known for burning his victims in waste oil . 
  does she get back the taxes she and her parents paid ? 
  her swiss fiancee should obviously also get his taxes back . 
  why pay taxes if you do n't get a say in maintaining the community . 
   this graph is based on per capita . 
  exactly . 
  and a 1 % increase will lead to 10.66 more cases with turkish suspects . 
  while a 1 % increase will lead to 0.74 more cases with american suspects . 
  according to the official statistic there were 21,895 filipinos in germany at the end of 2016 . 
  19,059 at the end of 2009 . 
  not sure where the wikipedia number comes from . 
  maybe it includes filipinos that became german citizens . 
  and there were 5 filipinos who were suspected of a crime against sexual self-determination in 2016 . https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/bevoelkerung/migrationintegration/auslaendbevoelkerung2010200167004.pdf?__blob=publicationfile, 
  yes . 
  the by-nationality crime statistics does n't take residential status into account . 
  the population obviously only contains residents . 
  there 's no statistic that breaks down non-tourists on a per country base . 
  103 of 8221 foreign suspects were tourists . 
  i suspect that the statistic is skewed for many `` western '' countries . 
  for example a while ago the us made up the third largest group of foreign tourists in germany . 
  i do n't have actual stats , but 10 years ago americans made up the third largest group of tourists that visited germany , behind the dutch and the swiss . 
  if i 'm not mistaken americans make up the largest group of foreigners that visit the oktoberfest . 
  there 's a good chance that plenty of these crimes were perpetrated by drunk tourists . 
  for a lot of countries the statistics are skewed because of tourism . 
  i would bet quite a lot of money that the us is one of these countries . 
   they 're called military bases . 
  the only actual no-go zones for german police . 
   im all most willing to put money on betting that those 4 offences were commited in late september to early october . 
  by non-residents, 
  i just opened two of the excel files that were cited as sources in the op . 
  at least he or she went all-in and involved a child . 
  / s they were suspect of `` exhibitionistische/sexuelle handlungen vor kindern \u00a7 176 abs . 
  1 stgb ''  section 176 - child abuse   ( 4 ) whosoever  - 1 \\ . 
  engages in sexual activity in the presence of a child ;   shall be liable to imprisonment from three months to five years . 
  which in most cases translates to public masturbation in front of a child . 
  i accidentally only used the number of australian women , and forgot 7130 australian men . 
  the new quota would be 30.5 suspects per 100,000 not 66.8 . 
  34 people suspected of crimes against sexual self determination were foreign soldiers stationed in germany or relatives of these soldiers . 
  that obviously includes non-us soldiers as well . 
  here are the absolute number of suspects per nationality , sorted the same as in the op . 
  as graphs : [ germans included ] ( http://i.imgur.com/35vlwjl.png ) , [ foreigners only ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3cverh.png ) - algeria 148 - gambia 64 - afghanistan 838 - somalia 90 - lebanon 107 - iran 236 - tunisia 78 - morocco 171 - nigeria 108 - albania 108 - iraq 436 - lybia 27 - eritrea 94 - egypt 40 - syria 910 - bulgaria 309 - kosovo 222 - serbia 223 - cameroon 23 - macedonia 100 - ghana 33 - romania 449 - georgia 18 - turkey 1066 - usa 74 - armenia 11 - lithuania 17 - germany 24835 - thailand 18 - vietnam 26 - russia 66 - mexico 4 - china 32 - japan 1, 
  i 'll help you out . 
  4 australians were suspected of crimes against sexual self determination in 2016 , at the end of 2016 13,115 australians were living in germany . 
  so you 'll end up at 4 / ( 13115/100000 ) or 30.5 suspects per 100,000 . 
  germans are there . 
  34.1 per 100,000 . 
  in absolute numbers there were 24,835 suspects compared to a total of 8,698 non-german suspects . 
  good points . 
  but is there an actual relation between poverty and crimes against sexual self determination ? 
  that would be `` ungekl\u00e4rt / ohne angabe '' or `` unresolved , not specified '' in englih . 
  the police obviously does n't guess . 
  114,145 americans are living here and 74 americans were suspected of crimes against sexual self determination . 
  since you verified that graph , can you tell us what numbers they used for nafri and maghreb ? 
  and were did they get the population numbers from that are n't included in the mentioned sources ? 
  the whole continent . 
   if they mean the whole continent , then how is the number higher for eritrea than afrika ? 
  because people from other african countries are less often the suspects of crimes . 
  so the average for africa is lower . 
  though i 'm not sure which numbers they used exactly . 
  i added the african countries from the crime statistics table and end up with 974 suspects . 
  when i divide that by the 510,535 africans according to destatis , i end up with 190.8 / 100,000 for africa . 
  they only have 136.4 . 
  for comparison 24,835 germans were suspects of crimes against sexual self determination . 
  in this case suspect means that they have a name . 
  if you go to the police and say `` someone stole my car . 
  must have been a pole '' , they wo n't add one to the number of polish suspects . 
  then divide every number by 100,000 if it makes you happy . 
  does n't change the relative length of the bars though . 
  per 100,000 simply produces readable numbers . 
  that 's why it 's a often used number when talking about crimes . 
   wait a second , so these are not convicts but suspects what 's the problem with suspects ? 
  it 's a statistic from the police , not from the court . 
   and it does n't show the amount of crimes that happened , but the number of suspects in relation to the total number of people in the population group ? 
  what 's the problem with per capita statistics ? 
  that 's exactly what is needed in that case . 
   edit2 : there are 21.320 algerians in germany , so does that mean there have been 138 algerien suspcts accused of rape ? 
  there were 148 algerians that were suspected of crimes against sexual self determination . 
   and there are 1.4 million turks in germany , does that mean there have been 994 turks accused of rape ? 
  there were 1066 turks that were suspected of crimes against sexual self determination . 
  316 polish suspects and 783,085 poles in germany . 
  so 40.36 crimes against sexual self determination per 100,000 poles . 
  ever heard of separation of powers ? 
  and i thought the judges were slow working corrupt communists who conspired to kill lech kaczy\u0144ski . 
  that 's something one would expect from a police state but not from the uk . 
  if you can conclude reasonable suspicion from the refusal of voluntary action the police can do whatever they want , without any limits . 
  do you agree if we search you ? 
  then we 'll do it anyway , because we now have reasonable suspicion that you are hiding something . 
  can we enter your home ? 
  that means we can enter your home because you are now a suspect of a crime . 
  do you want to make use of your right to remain silent ? 
  then you must be guilty . 
  one does n't have to prove that people do n't read tos , privacy agreements or contracts . 
  everyone already knows that . 
  that 's why we need strong consumer protection laws . 
  nice publicity stunt , but thanks to the [ council directive 93/13/eec of 5 april 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:31993l0013 ) this would be unenforceable anyway . 
  who can dismiss judges before their tenure ends in the netherlands ? 
  it 's not controversial if you only look at the part about selecting judges . 
  here in germany judges ca n't be dismissed because the justice minister or the president claims that they are communists . 
  they can only be dismissed for breach of duty , dishonourable behavior , or a conviction to a prison sentence of more than 6 respectively 12 months . 
  except in the latter case , there 'll be a court that decides if the judge has to be dismissed .
