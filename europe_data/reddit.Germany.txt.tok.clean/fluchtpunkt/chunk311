  climate change does n't get you refugee status . 
  cheap travel is the reason why airlines and ferry companies do n't let you board without a valid visa . 
  so why does the convention have to change ? 
  the whole point is that it 's unlimited . 
  because if granting refugee status would be voluntarily countries would n't do it if it becomes inconvenient . 
  the majority of current asylum seekers do n't qualify for asylum anyway . 
  changing the convention wo n't make them go away . 
  yes , people who received subsidiary protection are eligible for citizenship . 
  the usual requirements , the most relevant in these case the requirement to run your household without welfare , still apply . 
  here are the results of first instance decisions of ayslum applications between january and june 2017 : - 408,147 decisions - ** 85,283 ( 20.9 % ) refugee status ** - ** 69,921 ( 17.1 % ) subsidiary protection ** - 27,265 ( 6.7 % ) temporary deportation ban - 159,777 ( 39.1 % ) rejected - 65,901 ( 16.1 % ) decision not necessary for other reasons . 
  asylum application withdrawn , relocated under the dublin regulations the bold ones are generally eligible for citizenship, 
  who cares what 's the situation in syria . 
  we literally ca n't even return people to tunisia and morocco . 
  these are literally vacation destinations for europeans . 
  some corrections that make your attempt at math even worse . 
  germany has not received 2 ~ ~ .5 ~ ~ million asylum seekers since 2015 . 
  we received 890,000 in 2015 , 280,000 in 2016 . 
  90,400 in the first months of 2017 . 
  so 1.26 million asylum seekers since 2015 . 
  rejected asylum seekers do n't qualify for family reunification . 
  you only qualify if you received asylum status , refugee status or subsidiary protection . 
  that was the case for 35 % of the decisions that were made in june 2017 . 
  ~ ~ to qualify for family reunification you have to be able to support your family without welfare . ~ ~, 
  we ca n't even deport rejected asylum seekers to tunisia or morocco . 
  i 'm not seeing why it should be easier to deport them back to syria . 
  that upper limit is a way to calm the electorate , it wo n't have an effect in real life . 
  and that will not change if we have a hard limit on refugees . 
  rejected asylum seekers are also not eligible for citizenship . 
  they do n't have a residence permit that allows them to stay in germany forever , which is a requirement for obtaining citizenship . 
  in the same way people on student visa do n't qualify for citizenship . 
  i still do n't understand if such a limit is supposed to change anything in practice or if it 's just for the voter so he feels that politicians do something . 
  right now countries struggle with deporting rejected asylum seekers , i.e. 
  the ones that do n't qualify for refugee status because of their actual situation , i.e. 
  the thousands of asylum seekers from tunisia , morocco , bangladesh , nigeria and pakistan . 
  why should that suddenly change when we declare that only x of the asylum seekers that would actually qualify for refugee status will receive refugee status ? 
  how would we manage to return people to syria or eritrea if we ca n't even return people to tunisia . 
  hungary already imports gas from russia . 
  since neither turkish stream nor south stream are operational that gas currently flows through ukraine . 
  that will change with that proposed pipeline . 
  but since hungary is in v4 and they promised to veto any eu sanctions against poland , poland ca n't risk to criticise them for undermining the energy security of ukraine . 
  talking about context , why are you ignoring the context of my posting ? 
  i even quoted it . 
  i 'm not going around and tell others that i 'm awesome because i have an opinion . 
  he did . 
  the soror-merkel gang ca n't even run a proper censorship regime . 
  they missed 99 % of the media outlets and only censored zdf . 
  go to libya , pay a smuggler to bring you to europe and the ngos will pick you up as well . 
   this shows the limits of german democracy : it 's own citizens . 
  indeed . 
  the worst thing about democracy are the people who do n't vote for the party you prefer . 
  most democracies have leaders that are much more powerful than the german chancellor . 
  so these countries have term limits . 
  merkel ca n't do much without the backing of the parliament . 
  we do n't even elect the chancellor directly . 
   they even call her mutti ( `` mommy '' ) . 
  that 's primarily an ironic description used to criticise or make fun of merkel . 
  when pegida/afd shouts `` mutti muss weg '' they do n't want to show their affection to merkel . 
  rather strange headline . 
  us and many others have boots on the ground in kosovo since 1999 . 
  they try really hard ? 
  and in the cases where they ca n't , they withdraw themselves from the case on the ground of bias . 
  and if one of the plaintiffs believes that the judge is biased because of their political view they can request that the judge is replaced . 
  i think that 's how it works in every country . 
  not sure how it is in other countries , but you can totally be a judge and a member of a political party in germany . 
  the problem is not so much the appointing , it 's the removal . 
  in most countries there are large hurdles to remove judges before the end of their tenure . 
  sounds short-sighted . 
  hurting the economies of these countries will lead to even more economic migrants . 
  it will be even harder to convince all 28 eu members of these sanctions than it was with russia . 
  let 's talk nigeria for example , multiple eu countries import lng from there . 
  and even those who do n't have an interest in that trade , because lack of options will increase price . 
  so we will again exclude energy trade . 
  96 % of nigeria 's exports are petroleum products . 
  i fully understand , that in de it may be unthinkable , to have your own opinion . 
  sharing the opinion of the ruling party , you are such a freethinker . 
  and here 's how they do it , they deport them back to the country where they were prior to entering the us . 
  all people from southern or central america will be deported to mexico . 
  and mexico has to figure out how to return them to their actual home country . 
  that 's basically the dublin regulation . 
  if i remember correctly , greece did n't like that concept . 
  great idea . 
  now we just have to solve the actual problem we have in the eu . 
  that we ca n't deport people because their home countries refuse to take their citizens back . 
  unfortunately actual deporting rejected asylum seekers is massively more complicated than everyone believes . 
  even the us struggles with that . 
  that 's why they deport everyone regardless of nationality back to mexico if they entered via mexico . 
  the equivalent of the netherlands doing that would be to deport them back to belgium or germany . 
  who will then deport them back to the next country until they finally end in spain , italy or greece which ca n't deport them further . 
  that 's actually what the dublin regulations are about . 
  if you do n't already have family in another eu country , the country where you entered the eu is responsible for your asylum application . 
  unfortunately these countries are still part of the eu . 
  australia 's asylum policy would not work in the current situation we face . 
  it works for australia because basically all asylum seekers that do n't come via plane enter via indonesia , which cooperates with australia to return asylum seekers . 
  african countries do n't have interest in doing the same with the eu . 
  while indonesia actively stops vessels with asylum seekers that try to leave indonesia , african countries even try to prevent that their own citizens are send back home . 
  australia also moves all asylum seekers to papua new guinea before they touch australian soil . 
  because of that these asylum seekers do n't fall under australian jurisdiction , and they have no right to asylum in australia . 
  there 's no country which wants to be the papua new guinea of the eu . 
  contrary to popular believe it 's totally irrelevant that png is an island . 
  putting asylum camps on an eu island would be a massive waste of money .
