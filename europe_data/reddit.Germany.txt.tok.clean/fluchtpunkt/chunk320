  in reality they all participate in eutm mali . 
  though that 's not a combat mission , it shows that it 's not only france that wants a jihadi-free mali . 
   go outside and ask an average citizen if they would book a flight ticket to miami or would die for lithuania against russia . 
  travel back to august 2001 and ask an average citizen if they would die for usa against afghanistan . 
  then wait two months and see which countries did n't react to the invocation of article 5 with military force . 
   because it would be silly for russia to attack a country that controls their pipe . 
  it 's almost like having nuclear deterrence . 
  should have told that to ukraine . 
   the majority of the time , they do n't even attempt to deliver your package and then they lie and say you were n't home . 
  maybe where you live . 
  i have never experienced this . 
  and i receive letters that have the wrong house number on them because the woman that delivers mail has n't changed in years and knows where the names live . 
  service quality seems to change a lot depending on the area . 
  seriously . 
  i never had a problem with dhl . 
  and i received something like 1000 packages from them in the last 10 years . 
  ca n't remember a single one missing . 
  the only ones i had to pick up at the post office when i was n't home were the ones that required my own signature . 
  the others were delivered to my neighbour , and i always had the little card telling me about that in my mailbox . 
  but i 'm living in a small city , all the lazy dhl driver stories seem to come from berlin . 
  at least it 's the best lazy teenage student negotiator the uk has to offer . 
   the problem with free movement only arises because of porous external borders . 
  how ? 
  freedom of movement is limited to citizens of eu countries , eea countries and switzerland . 
  people from other countries do n't enjoy freedom of movement . 
  not just villages , most municipalities with a population of less than 75,000 rely entirely on volunteer firefighters . 
  we currently have [ 106 berufsfeuerwehren ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_der_deutschen_st\u00e4dte_mit_einer_berufsfeuerwehr ) in germany . 
  and 691 municipalities with a population of more than 20,000 . 
  [ in 2008 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/freiwillige_feuerwehr#statistik ) we had 1,055,255 volunteer firefighters and 27,603 `` job firefighters '' in germany . 
  indeed what he said does n't make a lot of sense . 
  you do n't train volunteer firefighters if you do n't intend to use them . 
  in germany basically all municipalities with a population of less than 75,000 have only volunteer firefighters . 
  pretty old statistic , but in 2008 we had 1,055,000 volunteer firefighters and 27,600 job firefighters . 
  not once from post/dhl . 
  and i work from home . 
  what ? 
  never had problems . 
  they are still fighting an enemy with very little capabilities . 
  germany was engaged in combat in afghanistan . 
  as useless against russia as having boots on the ground in syria . 
  but no face-sitting porn !, 
  it 's off by default . 
  at least it was off on all ios-devices i bought in germany . 
   it 's kind if infuriating when i think about how in some countries kids `` volunteer '' as firefighters because the title makes them cool and they know they 'll only ever deal with controlled test fires . 
  which countries would that be ? 
  i 've never heard that . 
  which country has no large scale forest fires but still has volunteer firefighters who are only called for large scale forest fires ? 
  but without the death camps . 
  they already do . 
   still , it would require a form of organazition to set this up . 
  like the [ european civil protection and humanitarian aid operations ( echo ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/echo/index_en ) of the european commission ? 
  [ emergency response coordination centre ( ercc ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/civil-protection/emergency-response-coordination-centre-ercc_en ), 
  then lithuania will point out that the situation in ukraine is/was similar and the nato members will take that into account . 
  nato members can invoke articles 4 and 5 . 
  that 's the difference to ukraine . 
   russians are currently fighting a war in syria and are gaining valuable experience . 
  bombing syrians who , due to lack of equipment , do n't fight back will totally get them the necessary experience they need for fighting nato . 
  they are still in africa , not already in hungary like last time . 
  more than 400,000 asylum seekers entered hungary in 2015 , before merkel supposedly invited everyone . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier#impact_on_the_number_of_illegal_migrants_entering_hungary, 
  spain would totally have more jobs if it were n't for the german car manufacturers in spain . 
  less german industry = more jobs . 
  guess how the oh so exploited countries would look like if the german automotive sector moves their supply chain back to germany . 
   so i think it 's major source in our cause ( or maybe even main ) theoretically . 
  in practice the terminal handled just 1.5 billion cubic meters gas equivalent between december 2015 and march 2017 . 
  because lng imports are more expensive than russian gas . 
  the eu has something like 100 bcm unused regasification capacity . 
  for some reason nobody has interest in replacing russian gas with lng imports . 
  not even poland . 
   we have lng terminal too , in \u015awinouj\u015bcie indeed . 
  and while poland imported 11.07 bcm of russian gas in 2016 ^ ^ [ source ] ( http://www.gazpromexport.ru/en/statistics/ ) , the \u015awinouj\u015bcie lng terminal imported 1.5 bcm of gas equivalent between december 2015 and march 2017 ^ ^ [ source ] ( http://en.polskielng.pl/press-centre/news/news/artykul/201477/ ) . 
  the terminal has an annual regasification capacity of 5 bcm , and if they add the third tank capacity could easily reach 7.5 bcm ^ ^ [ source ] ( http://en.polskielng.pl/lng/lng-terminal-in-poland/ ) . 
  so why only import 1.2 bcm per year via the terminal if you could cut russian imports by 75 % ? 
  because lng imports are more expensive than russian gas ? 
  and because poland uses the lng terminal as a fallback option in case gazprom messes too much with the gas exports to poland ? 
  your calculation has a small problem . 
  the l in lng stands for liquified . 
  lng terminals in the exporting countries turn gas into a liquid that is put on a lng carrier . 
  on the importing side the liquified gas will be turned back into a gas . 
  while we import 50 billion cubic meters ( [ 2016 ] ( http://www.gazpromexport.ru/en/statistics/ ) ) of gas from russia , that 's actually a gas , not a liquid . 
  1 cubic meter of lng turns into more than 600 cubic meters of gas . 
  so we could replace the russian imports with around 80 million cubic meters of lng imports . 
  so less than 1 large lng carrier per day . 
  while that endeavour will be quite expensive it should be doable . 
  got a source for that ? 
  germany as the biggest exporter to russia is the least affected ? 
  how does that work ? 
  does that count `` wants to join schengen but is blocked by other schengen members '' as positive or negative answer ? 
  sure , it sounds great to receive long maturity loans with interest rates that are way below market rates for greece . 
  but these loans come with a list of very hard conditions that you have to implement . 
   greece gets no money ( or debt relief ) . 
  one could say it 's a bailout . 
  mind = blown -- in 2017 greece has to pay back : - 591 million euro to the imf - 14.8 billion euro to treasury bill holders - 2 billion to private investors - 3.8 billion to the ecb - 10 million to the eib not sure how loans from eurozone governments to pay back those can be considered moving money from one pocket to the other . 
  because all these entities are totally independent from eurozone governments . 
  8.5 billion euro in very low interest , long maturity loans that will be used to pay back 8.5 billion euro in debt plus interest . 
  their debt wo n't increase significantly . 
  previous loans from eurozone governments had an interest rate of 0.5 % plus a short-term rate that is near zero . 
  this month greece has to pay back 5.2 billion euro to treasury bill holders which will receive between 2.7 and 2.97 % interest rate on top of that . 
  replacing these loans with ~ 0.5 % loans is basically a very slow debt relief .
