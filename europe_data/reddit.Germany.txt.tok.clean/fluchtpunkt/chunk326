  even huawei and other chinese brands contain some of these chips . 
   or if there are companies which supported a small mustachioed man who did n't like people with little skull caps . 
  ibm ? 
   made in america products . 
  that 's quite easy . 
  you can drink coca cola , eat at mcdonald 's and buy iphones without touching products that are labelled with `` made in usa '' . 
   the other rule is fruit , vegetables only locally . 
  from heated greenhouses , which are almost always worse than transport by truck ? 
  made in america or products made by american companies and their subsidies ? 
  if the latter i can pretty much guarantee you that you have something from procter & gamble or colgate-palmolive in your household . 
  it does n't matter what anyone believes . 
  by definition a customs union has to negotiate common trade agreements . 
  if greece would leave the eu customs union ( if that were possible ) i doubt that the increased trade with the us would offset the decreased trade with the rest of the eu . 
  and while joining the eu they gave up their trade sovereignty . 
  like the us , the eu is a customs union . 
  and a customs union does n't work if individual members can make trade agreements . 
  goods from third countries that have passed customs in a country inside the customs union are considered internal goods . 
  that 's why the eu ca n't do a trade deal with california and the us ca n't do one with greece . 
   would you use the same arguments within a single country ? 
  that 's basically how it is in germany . 
  municipalities can set the tax factor that is used to calculate business tax . 
  the businesses in western europe . 
  the truckers are n't driving around for fun . 
  so you want to counter the proposal to treat workers equally with treating supermarkets unequally ? 
  what is proposed : - working in germany for a german company : 8.84 $ minimum wage - working in germany for a polish company : 8.84 $ minimum wage your counter proposal : - german supermarket in poland : 20 % extra tax - polish supermarket in poland : 0 % extra tax, 
   only reason i ask is because it has its headquarters in france with a , presumably , french ceo at its head . 
  the ceo is not the owner of a company . 
  carrefour is a publicly traded company . 
  if you have enough money you can own it . 
  just buy  50 % of the stocks . 
   so being at the mercy of german companies is a good thing now ? 
  yes that sucks . 
  we should not exploit eastern europe . 
  and that 's why we should change that . 
  those car jobs should move to portugal , spain , italy and greece instead of to eastern europe . 
  the eu wants a trade deal with california . 
  why do n't we get that ? 
  we have . 
  3 guys for whole germany . 
  maybe they are n't actually looking for people who can run 3km in 13 minutes . 
  maybe they are looking for people who push themselves to perform better than 90 % of the population respectively their gender . 
   reelected that 's not how you write impeached . 
  \\ #covfefe, 
  because the uk will continue to be one of the most important allies of the eu . 
  if you like it or not . 
  trump golf course in every city and he 'll be pleased . 
   or maybe the germans are a bit more mature and dont associate everything with nazis . 
  the authorities are n't , at least if it comes to things after the first part of the licence plate . 
  there are municipalities that forbid things like 88 ( ** h ** eil ** h ** itler ) , 14 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourteen_words ) , 18 ( ** a ** dolf ** h ** itler ) or 28 ( ** b ** lood & ** h ** onour ) . 
  yes , 28 is banned in some counties . 
  took me a while to understand why . 
  ss , kz , hj , ns have already be mentioned as banned . 
  it 's all we can realistically achieve . 
  we ( as in : the eu ) ca n't take away voting rights from poland because that would be vetoed by hungary . 
  and we ca n't take away voting rights from hungary because the rule of law procedures against hungary were started before we had the option to remove voting rights for countries that violate the rule of law . 
  if that would n't be the case , poland would obviously veto attempts to take away voting rights . 
   if ecj will say hungary shall take the 1200 migrants we shall do it , no question of that !, 
  the refugee relocation scheme has absolutely nothing to do with the rule of law procedures against hungary . 
  neither have the mip violations of germany , france and basically every country that is n't the czech republic . 
  the european commission has issues with the rule of law in hungary because 1 . the government keeps talking about reintroducing the death penalty 2 . the government runs blatant anti-migrant propaganda 3 . the government blames the eu for everything without acknowledging the role of the member states . 
   in an era of brexit , rise of euro scepticism , and imigration crisis , inflicting demage to ` rebel ' countries will only make them look closer at the pros/cons of eu exit . 
  to be honest , if there would be a way to kick them out of the eu we would n't be talking about cutting funds . 
  if countries violate the rule of law that is outlined in the eu treaties they are simple incompatible with the eu . 
  if the electorate values the reintroduction of the death penalty higher than their eu membership than they have to leave . 
  same is true if they believe paralysing their constitutional tribunal is more important than eu membership . 
  and in case of the eu this is about hungary and poland . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/effective-justice/rule-of-law/index_en.htm the key points from the resolution the european parliament has adopted in regards to [ hungary ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-//ep//text+ta+p8-ta-2015-0227+0+doc+xml+v0//en ) :  1 \\ . 
  insists that the death penalty is incompatible with the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law and respect for human rights on which the union is founded [ ... ]  3 \\ . 
  condemns the repeated statements made by hungarian prime minister viktor orb\u00e1n instigating a debate on a potential re-establishment of the death penalty in hungary [ ... ]  5 \\ . 
  denounces the public consultation on migration and the related country-wide billboard campaign initiated by the hungarian government , and stresses that the content and language used in the particular consultation launched in hungary , on immigration and terrorism , are highly misleading , biased and unbalanced , establishing a biased and direct link between migratory phenomena and security threats ; points out that replies to the online questionnaire are to be complemented by personal data , thus revealing one 's political opinions in violation of data protection rules ; calls , therefore , for this consultation to be withdrawn ; [ ... ]  6 \\ . 
  regrets the fact that the public consultation casts blame on the eu institutions and their policies without also acknowledging the responsibility of the member states in these areas ; recalls that the member states are fully involved in the eu legislative process ; in regards to [ poland ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?type=ta&amp;reference=p8-ta-2016-0123&amp;language=en&amp;ring=b8-2016-0461 ) :  3 \\ . 
  is seriously concerned that the effective paralysis of the constitutional tribunal in poland poses a danger to democracy , human rights and the rule of law ;  4 \\ . 
  urges the polish government to respect , publish and fully implement without further delay the constitutional tribunal 's judgment of 9 march 2016 and to implement the judgments of 3 and 9 december 2015 ;  5 \\ . 
  calls on the polish government to fully implement the recommendations of the venice commission ; shares the venice commission 's opinion that the polish constitution and european and international standards require that the judgments of a constitutional court be respected ;, 
  it 's not about violating individual laws , there are already procedures for that . 
  this is about violating the [ ` rule of law ' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/justice/effective-justice/rule-of-law/index_en.htm ) . 
  the european commission currently has issues with the rule of law in hungary and poland . 
  what 's your extraordinary ability ? 
  many of those who chat about moving to the us stop when they check the requirements . 
  the only realistic chance to move to the us is as a professional . 
  though the 2.5 % chance of winning in the green card lottery is n't that bad either . 
  unfortunately our statistic does n't show much about the groups that move abroad . 
  but 19 % of the 14,240 germans that moved to the us in 2014 , were scientist that went on a research stay . 
  be aware . 
  when germany sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
   work probably . 
  they are the biggest economy in the world , if your work is somewhat international going to the us is almost always a good option , at least if you want to earn lots of money . 
  that many german companies are global market leaders helps a lot . 
  if you work for bmw , bosch , siemens or other companies that have subsidies in the us you can temporarily move to the us relatively easy . 
   the reason they do n't move anywhere else is probably because there is n't another single big destination for them . 
  there now is . 
  switzerland has surpassed the us as our most common emigration destination in 2004 . 
   also , does n't moving/working in any schengen area nation only apply to citizens of member nations ? 
  not related to schengen , that 's just about crossing borders without systematic border checks . 
  it applies to everyone inside the schengen area . 
  what you mean is freedom of movement . 
  citizens of a eu , eea or swiss country can work in any other eu , eea or swiss country . 
  besides that immigration is a national matter . 
  if the czech republic decides to hand out work permits to us citizens nobody is going to stop them . 
  but that work permit is then only valid in the czech republic .
