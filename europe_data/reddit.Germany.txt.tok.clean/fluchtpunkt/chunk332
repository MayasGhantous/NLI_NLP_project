  with that much wisdom you could become next us president . 
  if alg ii ( i.e. 
  hartz 4 ) receivers would count toward working , we would count alg i receivers towards working as well . 
  and suddenly 0.0 x % unemployment rate . 
  and suddenly your bold claims turned into `` the truth is out there !, 
  open your eyes sheeple !!! '', 
  tourists love pineapple on pizza . 
   when suddenly these little wasps appear in the distance . 
  in case somebody has n't seen it yet , this is how it looks from behind : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbp-pj0unna earlier this year two german air force eurofighters intercepted an indian 777 that lost radio contact . 
  to be honest , i 'm a bit disappointed . 
  i hoped they planted bugs , went to stake-outs , used honey-traps , and rifled through trash . 
  you know , like spies from the movies . 
  but nope . 
  they `` just '' added people who worked there to their selector list that they run on all the network traffic they collect . 
   it said the bnd included the email addresses and phone and fax numbers of police investigators in its sector surveillance list . 
   it does n't make a member country safer , it just makes sure `` whoever it is against '' is eliminated . 
  which makes it safer . 
  guess what would have happened to crimea and eastern ukraine in 2014 if ukraine would have been a part of nato . 
  that 's right . 
  absolutely nothing . 
   nafta is being renegotiated . 
  without the uk . 
  why not ? 
  when somebody explains nafta to him , he might consider it no longer obsolete . 
  yep . 
  he 's playing 32d chess . 
  it 's not that he is uninformed and likes to tweet what he sees on fox & friends without fact checking . 
  it 's all a big plan to achieve what he wants . 
  while we thought he does n't know that wisconsin is n't a border state , he distracted us and dragged canada to the negotiation table . 
  he 's the master of the deal after all . 
  in that case nothing changes . 
  montenegro is part of isaf and therefor already a target . 
  i 'll go shopping now . 
  let 's see if i can find a bottle of wine from montenegro as compensation . 
  update : no montenegro wine on sale . 
  could have bought wine from bulgaria , romania and macedonia though . 
  how do these statistics handle multinational businesses ? 
  for example , the nord stream pipeline is owned and run by the nord stream ag , incorporated in switzerland . 
  nord stream ag is owned by russian gazprom , german wintershall , german e.on , dutch gasunie and french engie . 
  so which country is the importer of the natural gas that flows through nord stream ? 
  is it germany because the pipeline ends here ? 
  switzerland because they run the pipeline ? 
  or to take it into the extreme , is 51 % of that russian gas imported by russia ? 
  i already feel safer . 
  you can still do it . 
  there 'll be a public call for tender eventually . 
  regardless , the sanctions are a waste of time . 
  if someone does n't want to work he 'll send out the 5 applications per month that are required by the contract between the unemployed and the employment agency . 
  when he gets invited by an employer his goal is to make a bad impression . 
  he therefor comes late , keeps an unclean appearance and acts dumber than he is . 
  if he is unlucky and gets invited to do two days of trial work , he 'll get a sick certificate , or he just works really slow . 
  the employment agency ca n't sanction someone who is dumb and unqualified . 
  so if you act that way , you can continue to enjoy netflix . 
  i doubt that a 30 year lease of 9 floors of office space contains anything about subletting . 
  we 're not talking about an apartment here . 
  but even if the contract would contain such a clause , there 's a good chance that a court will invalidate it . 
  if you have a 30 year lease and ca n't legally use the building for your own , keeping the building empty is unreasonable . 
  they are n't related . 
  if they were , eu funds would be limited to regions where it 's necessary to offset these things . 
  hamburg does n't get eu funds because they suffer from a brain drain . 
  they get money because they have projects which qualify for eu funding . 
  poland does n't get eu money for building highways because western europe steals their workers . 
  they get that money because the eu funds projects that build highways in regions that have sub-standard highways . 
  romania does n't get eu funds to offset the effects austrian lumber companies have on their forests , they get eu funds because they have projects that qualify for eu funds . 
  central and eastern europe has a lot of infrastructure that can be considered sub-standard , they therefor receive a lot of funds for infrastructure projects . 
  but that has nothing to do with a compensation for brain drain or market access . 
  it has to do with projects that qualify for funding . 
  that there 's a relation is just the interpretation of people who want to argue that the eu has a moral obligation to send money to eastern europe . 
  achievement unlocked, 
  because of the privacy complains they withdrew the current law proposal , without discussing it . 
  they now want to change it , and re-introduce the proposal in mid may . 
   weird , it was n't too long ago that the overwhelming consensus by pro-refugee posters here got some quotes ? 
  when talking about asylum ` safe country ' has a specific meaning . 
  turkey limits the application of the un refugee convention to people who flee for reasons happening in europe . 
  it can therefor not be considered a safe country for people not fleeing from europe . 
  libya does n't have a government that is able to protect refugees . 
  it can therefor not be a safe country . 
  i thought they come here for welfare payments ? 
  how can they get them without applying for asylum ? 
  the agency for migration and refugee disagrees . 
  if you tried to be pedantic by saying that only 1-2 % received asylum according to the german constitution you should have been more precise . 
  ----- - 695,733 decisions were made in 2016 . 
  - 256,136 ( 36.8 % of the total ) ended in refugee status , those are the ones fleeing persecution . 
  that includes 2,120 ( 0.3 % ) who received asylum under art . 
  16a gg , which is restricted to people who came directly to germany without stepping into a safe third country , i.e. 
  mostly people who entered germany at an international airport from a non-eu destination . 
  - 153,700 asylum seekers ( 22.1 % ) received subsidiary protection , those are the ones that are n't prosecuted but are threatened by bodily harm when returned . 
  a lot of eritreans qualify for this . 
  - 24,084 ( 3.5 % ) qualified for a repatriation ban , for example because of medical reasons . 
  - 173,846 ( 25.0 % ) were rejected as unfounded . 
  - 87,967 ( 12.6 % ) cases were closed because the agency decided that they are n't responsible , for example because they can prove that the asylum seeker entered via another eu country . 
  says the guy who missed the moment when twitter rebranded favorite to like . 
  that one time you paid attention in history lessons finally paid off !, 
  when they believe they have a brilliant idea they leave their natural habitat to spread the word .

  another useless referendum that wo n't change anything because in the end the eu and schengen are too important for switzerland . 
  but hey , i 'm sure you can get another awesome compromise . 
  maybe they allow you to hold two guns with 10 rounds magazines simultaneously . 
  they are a schengen member .
