  that 's the fault of the countries that are afraid to deport people who do n't require protection . 
  you see , that 's why people try to escape serbia . 
  refugee means `` threatened by war or persecution '' , not `` being piss-poor '' . 
   and ? 
  do n't we want to help as many people as possible ? 
  unfortunately we can not afford that . 
  `` stations '' sounds so small and easy . 
  you have to accommodate ten-thousands of people in a safe way for months . 
  we ca n't even do that for the couple hundred people that are working in our embassies . 
  the un refugee convention was created with situations in mind that are way way way way worse than what we currently experience . 
  so un conventions and human rights are only important as long as they do n't cause inconveniences for us ? 
  are these the ~ ~ north korean ~ ~ european values we have to protect from the dirty muslims ? 
  most of the applicants that do n't receive protection are n't deported though . 
  a majority of them leaves voluntarily . 
  some become illegals and hide from the authorities . 
  and plenty just are n't deported because deportations are n't as easy as everyone seems to believe . 
  many will leave voluntarily . 
  not everyone from the balkan is willing to live the life of an illegal . 
  plenty just fall for the lies their distant relatives ( who help them for a small fee ) have told them . 
  once they realize that they wo n't have a chance to stay legally , they leave . 
  source : i have talked to my temporary neighbors , who were asylum applicants from the kosovo . 
  they now have returned to kosovo . 
   i still do n't understand why they should n't be able to file their asylum applicating from their home country . 
  because this will increase the number of refugees in europe . 
  every single non-criminal resident of syria would be eligible for asylum or subsidiary protection in europe . 
  that they have to go on a dangerous trip and have to pay huge amounts of money actually works as a deterrent . 
  the un refugee convention requires countries that have signed it to check asylum request on a case by case basis . 
  until that check is complete you obviously have to protect the asylum seeker . 
  if you want to process asylum applications before they enter the country you have to set up safe outposts in other countries . 
  good luck with that . 
  there were multiple bidders , none of them offered more . 
  i think we upgraded to the more technically advanced version . 
  strand = beach , muschel = shell . 
  the beach shell . 
  and a 1.4 billion euro investment . 
  and `` 22.9 million euros per year payment , adjusted for inflation . '', 
  do n't worry about bmw and audi . 
  worry about manufacturers that produce in uk for eu export , like honda and toyota . 
  what happens to their manufacturing plants if they have to pay 10 % tariff if they export to the eu ? 
  will they scale up their production ? 
  or will they move to another eu country . 
  in [ 2014 ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn00611.pdf ) , 53 % of the vehicles produced in the uk were exported to the eu . 
  norway and switzerland have freedom of movement agreements with the eu . 
  many in uk do n't want freedom of movement , because all these people from central and eastern europe want to work in uk . 
  what many people in uk do n't realize is that they do n't get access to the eu single market without agreeing to freedom of movement . 
  and schengen has nothing to do with that . 
  from a no-to-immigration point of view , joining schengen is even worse than eu membership . 
  ireland violates a bunch of [ mip indicators ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/indicators/economic_reforms/eip/#/headline/?selected_year=2013 ) , but they are far from violating the trade balance one . 
  what `` real actions '' have been taken for violating mip indicators ? 
  because every single eu country violates at least two of these indicators . 
   were the ducklings alive ? 
  this makes it sound like they were burned alive . 
  not even russian authorities euthanize dead animals . 
  ( article says they were euthanized and then burned ), 
  * my sympathies . 
  not sure if your post is banter in the `` everything is about uk '' direction or if you seriously believe that this was originally about the uk . 
  because the post that started this `` trend '' was about [ bulgaria ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gyke6/so_you_want_to_visit_bulgaria/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  just make sure that your army is the most powerful one . 
  where is the `` your car is already here '' joke ? 
  you are mixing that up . 
  your home is \\ / r/nationalsocialism . 
  and your shitty ideology has no home and will never have a home in europe . 
   you just have to get out of your home to see that the place around you has dramatically changed . 
  i just did that . 
  please tell me what i should have seen . 
  go back to \\ / r/nationalsocialism, 
  there is not a single swastika in the guardian article . 
  next time link to the guardian , instead of your favorite conspiracy blog . 
  many power plants take their cooling water out of rivers , it flows through the equipment and , now warmer , back into the river . 
  when rivers have only little water , the heated water that is put back heats up the rest of the river a lot more . 
  because there is less normal temperature water to mix . 
  if you heat the river water too much , you kill a lot of the things that live in and next to the river . 
  so environmental agencies limit the temperature increase to a safe value . 
  which means that power plants have to throttle down , or shut down completely . 
  source for `` over 90 % '' ? 
  how long until germany is blamed to have created , prolonged or worsened the chinese crisis ? 
  i see [ something else ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g4h7jhm.jpg ) in this picture . 
   having said this , however , the main reason the united states ended its shuttle program , and did not fund another , new , earth-to-leo aircraft is due to the desire to jump start a private space industry , outside of the normal defense contractors . 
  thus the birth of spacex and orbital sciences corporation . 
  of course . 
  it was not because the shuttle was an expensive mistake . 
  the project was scrapped to leave room for the creation of companies that were founded almost a decade and almost three decades earlier . 
  spacex was founded in 2002 . 
  orbital was founded in 1982 . 
  final shuttle flight was in 2011 . 
  because the nasa uses soyuz to protect it from the terrorists . 
  the esa uses soyuz because they are a bunch of incapable idiots .

  we 'll know soon . 
  might be time for reverse family reunion . 
  if you force your child to leave germany , you have to leave germany as well . 
  affected women should obviously receive asylum in germany . 
  but that will unfortunately increase the number of young women who are killed because of some honor bullshit .
