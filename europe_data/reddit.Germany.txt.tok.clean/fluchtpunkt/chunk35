   this raises important questions : chiefly , why has the under-representation of meps from formerly new member states in the post of rapporteur become a structural feature of the ep ? 
  there are three main readings of the unexpected results : firstly , the incentive set of this group of meps may differ from that of meps from older member states , making them less willing to take on the workload that accrues to a ( shadow ) rapporteur . 
  secondly , meps from these countries may adopt different methods for effective representation of their constituents ' interests and therefore have distinct skill sets . 
  as a consequence , they may be better suited for other positions or activities than those of the rapporteur . 
  thirdly , there might be a systematic bias in the rapporteurship allocation process , disadvantaging meps from newer member states . 
  as of now , it is an open question which of these arguments has the most explanatory power . 
   the uk government has not yet said at what level it thinks the threshold to block a law should be set . 
  the threshold should be `` one uk '' . 
  if uk objects a law it will be blocked , otherwise it passes . 
  it 's either that or brexit !, 
    ** a significant part of this reduction is directly attributable to the greek crisis **  ok . 
  so at least 10 % of the total reduction ? 
  i do n't know , but \\ / r/europe had a [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3f7gjo/us_marines_held_up_in_vienna_en_route_to_ukraine/?ref=search_posts ) about it . 
  ... two weeks ago . 
  you go to cheaper countries for things that the insurance does n't pay . 
  obviously . 
  nobody in their right mind would go to a cheap country if the local hospital does a similar job for the same price . 
  and corrective eye surgery and dental work is , in most cases , not fully covered by health insurance . 
  yeah . 
  they will rename french fries to freedom fries if you do n't want to join them in an invasion . 
  scary . 
   that 's pretty much how it works nowadays . 
  no it 's not . 
  all of the stuff you have mentioned is temporary . 
  every eu country except ireland and uk have to join schengen . 
  and except uk and denmark all eu countries have to adopt the euro . 
  and the restrictions on freedom of movement for new members are limited to 7 years maximum . 
  and there wo n't be opt-outs for these fundamental treaties for new members . 
  he was told that these are n't real people . 
  subhumans who deserve to be dead because they threaten the existence of the germanic race . 
  nowadays it 's the european identity that is threatened by subhumans who do n't deserve to live . 
  lol, 
  because the motive of the coin is planet earth . 
  because research and development does n't cost anything ? 
  i 've heard that people are able to switch language depending on who they are talking to . 
   a study that states `` x crime rate is higher among x immigrant group '' is something worth discussing . 
  that 's pointless as well . 
  crime is connected to social status , age and income . 
  not to religion or nationality . 
  if i look at the german crime statistics , romanians and poles seem to be way more criminal than those evil criminal turks . 
  not necessarily within the same country . 
  why exactly ? 
  the name suggest something else , but deutsche bank is a private company . 
  deutsche bank has some shady business practice and is investigated regularly . 
  last year the us investigated deutsche bank for alleged tax fraud . 
  in june german prosecutors raided the deutsche bank headquarters . 
  so please enlighten me . 
  let me just quote the last paragraph from the [ dw article ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/anniversary-of-operation-storm-the-crimes-others-committed/a-18624692 ) about the anniversary of operation storm . 
   so everyone has been going in circles the past two decades , maintaining their accusations against each other and thus , making a genuine reconciliation difficult . 
  croatia and serbia still have other unresolved issues with each other - from the fate of missing people , to the controversial border along the danube river . 
  `` all the politicians in the region -- be they left or right-wing - like to play the nationalist card , '' says popovic . 
  he fears that without honest introspection about the war crimes on both sides , the shadow of the war will never fade . 
  how young are you ? 
  most likely `` made up '' as in `` consists '' . 
  the map is full of countries that were fucked by the soviet union . 
  until the euro is abolished . 
  obviously . 
  if only there would be a way to stop the sanctions . 
  if putin would n't have intervened , we would totally run the camps that would kill all the people with russian roots . 
  it 's right in our history . 
  that 's the chance for the italian health authority to install a drug counseling booth in the club . 
  advise users on safe use and offer drug-testing so party-goers can know what the stuff they take actually is . 
  but who am i kidding . 
  best case they will require the club to do full cavity searches . 
  worst case they start to have drug raids every couple weeks . 
  who would have thought that nimby actually exists . 
  - increase decision speed , so a final decision on each case is made within 4 weeks - deport anyone who does not need protection - imprison people who lie about their origin - open locked-down asylum centers for people who do n't cooperate , or conveniently forget where they are from - distribute the people that need protection throughout the eu in decentralized housing projects there is not more we can do without trampling on human rights . 
  things like `` fix libya/africa/middle east '' are pipe dreams . 
  things like letting people register for eu asylum outside of the eu will just increase the number of refugees in the eu . 
  slovakia wants into nordic too . 
  username checks out . 
  poor finland . 
  if you see human depicting emojis with golden skins you are most likely using os x or ios . 
  apple recently implemented skin color modifiers for these emojis . 
  the default human emojis , i.e. 
  those that do n't have a skin color modifiers , are now rendered in yellow . 
  on [ older apple systems ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/gay-family-emojis-apple_n_6743968.html ) or other systems that do n't implement the skin color attributes , human emojis almost always have [ whitish skin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qxzjryh.png ) . 
  yep . 
  it 's important that we can always weasel out of our military alliances . 
  you do n't have to declare money when you travel in the eu . 
  only when leaving or entering the eu . 
  for example if you go to switzerland or norway . 
  mainly tax evasion . 
  declaring the money is not a big deal , at least if the money is legal and you have paid or intend to pay taxes on it . 
  you just have to fill out a short form , it only takes a couple minutes . 
  here 's the form from the czech republic : http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/customs/customs_controls/cash_controls/declaration_forms/declaration_form_cz_en.pdf, 
  and it 's not eu only . 
  when entering the us he , and everyone else , has to declare amounts over $ 10,000 as well . 
  you are confusing smileys and emojis . 
  emojis depicting humans where never abstract . 
  i was confused for a second , because in german we call biplanes doppeldecker . 
  stay away from umbrellas . 
  probably still better than greece . 
  pole dancers do n't accept electronic transfers . 
  baltic . 
  to-may-to . 
  to-mah-to . 
   -- i 'm partly joking . 
  i know that latvia is one of the baltic countries . 
  and i 'm pretty sure it 's not the northern most , because that is estonia .
