  but that 's were my knowledge ends . 
  yes , i 'm american by heart . 
  i thought the us have such a rule . 
  germany has such a limit for the president ( currently joachim gauck ) , he or she can not run more than two consecutive terms . 
  there is no such limit for the chancellor . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causa_guttenberg and there were many more politicians that were accused of plagiarism . 
  some lost their doctorate . 
  it 's either one of the four countries above poland , or one of the two dozen countries above greece . 
  but i 'm not sure . 
  scandalous !, 
  laws should not apply for celebrities !, 
  ( yes , op , i saw your comment ) i wonder what cbp in the usa would say if he enters with undeclared money . 
  yes , people ( even us citizens ) entering the us have to declare monetary values above $ 10,000 as well . 
  across the street . 
  you do n't have to kill to live in salzburg . 
  as eu citizen you have freedom of movement . 
  you might not be able to afford a luxury house , but if you find a job you could very likely live in a small apartment in salzburg . 
  you are young , learn something that is useful and go for it . 
  you sound like an idiot . 
  i hope you just had a bad day . 
  germany should hire a few pr people . 
  outrageous action , and then fast paced backpedaling a few days later . 
  and now they try to sweep anything under the table . 
  it 's not the first time that something like that happened . 
  just last month ahmed mansour was arrested and then quickly released after media all over the world has reported about the story . 
  you are right , not being a member of the schengen treaty does not stop romanian citizens from moving to the schengen area . 
  but it stops people who are n't romanian citizen from doing the same . 
  the fear is that corrupt officials in romania ( and bulgaria ) will give schengen visa to people who are n't eligible . 
  they do n't have enough livestock to make that marriage work . 
  and if they have enough livestock to pay eu for marriage , the french farmers will burn the eu down . 
  i guess that means no . 
  planned ? 
  full operational capability ( i.e. 
  you can actually receive something from galileo satellites ) in 2013 . 
  that wo n't happen until 2016 though . 
  the system might be fully operational ( i.e. 
  world wide coverage , prepared for satellite failures ) in 2020 . 
  but that 's a big maybe . 
  but you are already able to buy galileo compatible products . 
  most modern gps receivers probably just need a firmware update . 
   tyres are you sure that you are american ? 
   do you read the articles posted in / r/europe or just the headlines ? 
   [ ] just the titles  [ ] depends on the topic  [ ] just the titles thanks god i wanted to choose the middle one anyway ... 
  if you need a gun to feel safe , you should stay in the us . 
  i do n't know the gun laws of each european country , but i can pretty much guarantee that you will not be able to carry your gun around . 
  if you do that , all 5 of them will leave the council . 
  somewhere around the second arrow , the lenders realize that they should n't give money to greece . 
  nope . 
  1 are is 10 x 10 meters . 
  and 100 ares are 1 hectare . 
  so 1 hectare is 100 x 10 x 10 meters . 
  or 100 x 100 meters . 
  or 10000 square meters . 
  except that there is no such law . 
  freedom of panorama exists in germany . 
  google offered the option to blur houses out of good will . 
  worst case google had to lower their cameras to 2.5 meters because that 's what a person can photograph without additional means , e.g. 
  a ladder . 
  but that would have taken an actual court cases to figure out . 
  there was one court ruling about street view , but it was pretty much in favor of google because the court decided that a mere published photography of a facade does not violate the privacy of the people living there . 
  google stopped because bild and other major media outlets ran a campaign against google . 
  if you pay for notary and administration fees i could see if i can give you 1 square meter of farm land in saxony . 
  it 's worth something like 1 $ . 
   so while the state obviously has a legal right to access its own data , they called the secrecy for `` hacking '' . 
  his 20 butlers are so rich that they have their own butlers . 
  in [ 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_\\ ( non-eu \\ ) _ asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states , _ by_age_distribution , _ 2014 _ \\ ( \u00b9 \\ ) _ yb15_iii . png ) it was 202,645 for germany and 81,180 for sweden . 
  that 's quite exactly 40 % . 
  but the ausl\u00e4nders take away our womenz !, 
  look up family reunion possibilities for accepted refugees, 
  i can totally envision it . 
  while holding a molotov cocktail in their hand , mirko and ronny discuss how many `` real refugees '' live in the asylum center . 
  because they do n't know how many `` good asylum seekers '' live there they have to ring the bell and ask the gatekeeper how many of the people living there have a chance to receive protection . 
  and then they argue what quota is enough to burn the place down . 
  neeein mirko , we need more than 50 % economic migrants to be on tze safe side . 
  neeeeeee , i do n't see a single woman here , which means they are all asylum fraudsters . 
  sounds like a sequel to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqpmqzb5vfs ), 
  people that attack asylum seekers do n't give a flying fuck why somebody is here . 
  vocal support does n't cost a dime . 
  time to stop this euroreich . 
  germany should leave the eu . 
  so all the countries that are kept down by evil germany can finally turn into the economic powerhouses they deserve to be . 
  have it done by a professional ( t\u00dcv-s\u00fcd or something ) on penis inspection day . 
   ( no economic refugees ) the it guy that moves to silicon valley because he earns more than twice the money he can get in germany ? 
  that 's an economic migrant . 
  the german geriatric nurse that moved to switzerland ? 
  economic migrant . 
  economic migration is the default mode . 
  if you migrate to a different country and do n't use that chance to improve your standard of living you are not very smart . 
   apart from some folklore , we do n't form any sub culture or even parallel societies ever been to spain or mallorca ? 
  or villa germania in thailand ? 
  a friend of mine had a bakery in alicante , spain . 
  she has some nice stories about the well integrated germans that everyone loves . 
   there are no refugee camps in germany where there are unworthy living conditions . 
  if they live in tents , it 's by their own choice to force the german government to give them permanent asylum . 
  if they live in tents it 's because the asylum centers are over capacity . 
   the german position on this subject has always been the same , we help them where we can , but we 'd prefer the vast majority of them would go home as soon as possible . 
  hear hear . 
  i have to wonder why so few people are actually deported . 
  19 greek islands . 
  19 eurozone countries .
