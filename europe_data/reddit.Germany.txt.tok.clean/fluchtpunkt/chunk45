  instead of figuring out what 's best for europe , we are busy with nationalistic `` us vs. them '' crap . 
  the so called `` national identity '' stands in the way of solving international issues . 
  that 's why it has to die so europe is able to move forward . 
  it would be good if we would be able to react to things without turning everything into a battle between nation states that were forced to be in the same union . 
  if it 's made up this was made up a long time ago . 
  i 've heard that story from people that took a tour in greece in ~ 2000 . 
  their tour guide told them . 
  sure , tour guides tell a lot of bullshit , but there 's usually a bit of truth in everything . 
  the story made news in 2010 as well . 
  for example in [ the telegraph ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/7689375/greece-a-nation-at-war-with-itself.html ) . 
   there is no such law , which mandates a different amount of tax for housing `` under construction '' . 
  the question is if there is a law that changes the objective value of a building if it 's unfinished . 
  because according to [ this document ( p. 13 ) ] ( http://www.ap-lawoffice.de/fileadmin/pdf/downloads/real_estate_greece_2013.pdf ) there is a * special status coefficient * of 0.4 for unfinished buildings . 
  that means the taxed value of a building is reduced to 40 % if it 's unfinished . 
  if that is the case , the next question is what the greek law considers unfinished . 
  who would have thought that greece does n't make it into the top of a list that ranks countries by ** absolute ** tax evasion . 
  * oui * yes, 
   also while a haircut will eventually come ( even sch\u00e4uble knows that ) it will not happen until these reforms are implemented . 
  so why not put the haircut into the bailout plan ? 
  everything ? 
  that sounds expensive . 
  time for germany to step down . 
  let spain , italy , poland , greece , hungary or whoever is willing , lead . 
  no more fourth reich , no more molotov-ribbentrop 2.0 , no more euro-holocaust . 
  it 'll be better for europe . 
  dissenting views ? 
  yanis varoufakis would use the word that means terrorism and fear mongering at the same time . 
  probably a bit more than that . 
  average gross salary in albania is 385 $ per month . 
  especially since the albanians will probably buy some water treatment systems from germany . 
  none of the money will actually go to the albanian people that are not connected to the water/sewage system !!!, 
  it will go straight to companies that will construct these systems !!!, 
  wake up , sheeple !!, 
  in a decade or six . 
  providing money to a country so it can build a water supply that is up to european standards . 
  the horror !, 
  did the ~ ~ idiot ~ ~ author that wrote the headline , read their own article ? 
   following the majority decision , they are now going to ask the government to reconsider the law , which states that incest is illegal in germany . 
   [ ... ] greece will come back and make europe rue the day they did what they did . 
  hopefully with not just a economic war but a actual war . 
  holy shit . 
   i might be asking a stupid question here , but why havent we seen anything in the media about this then ? 
  because the suicide rate in bavaria is still twice as high as it is in greece . 
  bavaria had [ 1727 suicides in 2013 ] ( http://www.br.de/nachrichten/suizide-praevention-bayern-100.html ) . 
  greek mass suicide my ass . 
  the debt would still be there . 
  there is no automatism for debt forgiveness . 
  debt does n't go away if you default . 
  but creditors will usually re-negotiate , i.e. 
  debt cuts are very likely . 
  did you ask ** your ** german bank ? 
  even my tiny local bank exchanges currency , for customers . 
  the 17th bundesland of our hearts will always be mallorca . 
  playing devils advocate : the czech republic is doing well because it is n't in the euro, 
  if you want to read the full story you have to buy his soon to be announced book . 
  i think we do n't know the definitive answer yet . 
  except for denmark and the uk , euro adoption is mandatory for eu members . 
  that does n't sound very compatible to un-adopting the euro while staying in the eu . 
  that is different than countries that do n't fulfill the criteria for euro-adoption ** yet ** . 
   we wrote off germanys debts because it would have been unrealistic for them to pay the entire thing back . 
  you did that because the western powers had the fear that the soviet union could increase their influence in europe if germany , back then the front line between capitalism and communism , would not be 100 % in favor of the western countries . 
  do n't pretend that there was altruism involved . 
  it was a geopolitical decision . 
  unfortunately for greece , they are not even remotely as important as west germany was after it became clear that the soviet union was not interested in a friendly relationship . 
  i counted , so others do n't have to . 
  11 pages essay and a cover letter . 
  i like how the perspective switches in your post . 
  romania fights corruption because they were forced by eu . 
  it 's the sole achievement of romania . 
  greece does not fight corruption because the troika does n't force them . 
  it 's the fault of the troika . 
   do you know who else did n't pay their debts back in 1953 ? 
  germany did n't . 
  european countries ( including greece ) sat around a table and said `` we are going to cut germany 's debt in half to help them '' . 
  that sounds so altruistic . 
  in reality it was a geopolitical decision . 
  and was n't there a bond swap in 2012 that basically removed 100 billion euro debt ? 
  something like 54.5 % of the debt ? 
  dear popcorn supplier , how fast can you deliver ? 
  and the new common currency will be called drachma . 
  for humiliation reasons . 
  if i use the `` democracy uber alles '' approach , the ball is clearly in the greek court . 
  they now have to make a proposal , and the rest of the eurozone holds a referendum if they want to accept that proposal . 
  but nobody wants that , because the majority will reject every greek proposal , regardless of its content . 
  did you mean * transfer union without common policy * ? 
  so what would greece do if the rest of the eu ignores their veto ? 
  issue counter sanctions ? 
  another law suit ? 
  while greece prints counterfeit euros everyone will watch because greece just says `` nope '' to every measure the eu suggests . 
  i would watch that movie . 
  in reality the eu would just ignore greece ' objections and deal with the aftermath of that decision later . 
  but these two choices have very different consequences . 
  if you had to decide between not paying your cellphone bill and robbing a bank , which would you pick ? 
  if greece starts to print euros , they will lose trust with countries , organizations and businesses worldwide . 
  countries who print counterfeit euros will also print counterfeit dollars , rubles , yen and yuan if it suits their needs . 
  and greece will lose access to swift immediately as well . 
  countries who print counterfeit money will also fake electronic transactions . 
  greece will not print euros without authorization , that would be like burning their country to the ground . 
   it would take greece three years to print enough $ 20 notes to pay for that . 
  maybe they could print us-dollars , rubles , yen , yuan and most importantly the british pound in parallel ?
