  party like there 's no tomorrow . 
  1999 eu is best eu . 
   meanwhile in america . 
  5.4 % unemployment . 
  and plenty americans can even enjoy more than one job . 
  they will not continue to do so anyway , because they will not be able to do so . 
  the question is how they should learn that lesson . 
  from a financial perspective it would probably be smarter to make them adopt austerity by rewarding them with debt refinancing ( during the next decade ) and debt forgiving after that . 
  all under the condition that they actually implement reforms and that they use the surplus to stimulate sustainable long-term economic growth instead of rehiring all the not necessary public workers . 
  a grexit on the other hand will get very costly for the eu and eurozone . 
  and i 'm not talking about the debt relief greece will be able to negotiate after they officially defaulted . 
   i actually dare to say that a falling of greece can help strengthen the bonds of other eu countries it will increase the fear in countries with weaker economies . 
  and it increases the leverage of stronger economies . 
  that 's not a good thing . 
   by the rules , after 5 years of doing it , the penalty is a fine equivalent to 1 % of gdp every year it continues . 
  so it 's good that the account balance of 2011 was 5.9 % btw , the same rule set puts the minimum account balance at -4 % . 
  which greece has violated basically every year except 2013 , in 2009 they had a nice -13.6 % in that column of the mip scoreboard . 
  expect an opinion piece from krugman within 12 hours . 
  are there other countries that say / zus / ? 
  american detected . 
  i bet 10 drachma that there will be a new currency within 60 days . 
  just snark because you said `` please write your country '' instead of `` please write your language '' , 
  in germany we say yes and no ( when we speak english ) . 
  -- and when we speak german we say ja and nein . 
  the photographer on a ladder was a much used argument against that argument back then . 
  but to figure out how retarded the argument actually is , people have to take the issue to court . 
  the only court rulings regarding google street view , that i am aware of , have ruled that people can take action against google if their privacy rights are ** actually ** violated . 
  so these decisions were partly in favor of google , because you would not be able to take action against google , just because they took photos of your house . 
  because google gave up to fight against german angst and the gigantic media campaign . 
  if they would have taken the issue to court there is a high chance that they would have been allowed to publish every single house without blurring . 
  the argument that photos from a camera in 3 meter height are not covered by freedom of panorama is moot . 
  but because the camera is not in `` normal person height '' , individuals would have been able to sue google if the street view pictures reveal something relevant in their apartment/house/garden that would not have been visible from a `` normal '' view position . 
  but google could have avoided that completely by lowering the camera to 2 meter . 
  and i prefer to not have to bribe a police officer because he accuses me of whatever law he just made up . 
  and in an attempt of isis to destroy all the champagne in the world , they drank themselves to consciousness . 
  because someone will ask for source : http://www.toureiffel.paris/en/the-eiffel-tower-image-and-brand/filming-at-the-eiffel-tower.html  #daylight views of the tower   ** free use **   the image of the eiffel tower by day falls within the public domain : its use is rights-free , and may therefore be reproduced without prior authorisation by the sete , the managing company of the image of the eiffel tower on behalf of the mairie de paris . 
    #the tower illuminated   ** controlled use **   the various illuminations of the eiffel tower ( golden illumination , twinkling , beacon and events lighting ) are protected . 
   the use of the image of the eiffel tower at night is therefore subject to prior authorisation by the sete . 
  this use is subject to payment of rights , the amount of which is determined by the intended use , the media plan , etc. 
  since the referendum requires a minimum turnout of 40 % , not voting is a valid expression of opinion . 
  it means `` this referendum should not exist '' . 
   trust me : it 's a lot better than letting that checkbox , besides your name , go empty . 
  based on what ? 
  do you guys have a system that distinguishes between `` invalid because stupid '' and `` invalid because opinion '' ? 
  in germany writing something funny or smart might lead to a 0.5 second chuckle by the person who puts the ballot on the invalid stack . 
  and at the end of the day these `` smart invalid '' votes are treated the same as ballots from people who are too stupid to vote correctly . 
  besides statisticians , nobody gives a fuck about these votes . 
  some people believe that invalid votes leads to lower percentage of the voted parties . 
  but that 's usually not the case , invalid votes are sorted out before percentages are calculated . 
  and what 's up with the name ? 
  no secrecy of the ballot in romania ? 
  btw , depending on the exact system that is used , invalid votes might count towards the required voter turnout . 
  so voting invalid might be the opposite of what is desired . 
  the crisis comes from the sum of dozens of small pieces like that . 
  how much are greek pensions reduced for early retirement ? 
  in germany it 's 0.3 % for every month people retire early . 
  from looking at their external trade data , it does n't look good for a greece with a currency that devalues strong and fast . 
  they will be humiliated enough if they require humanitarian aid . 
  but if they are outside the eu they would obviously be subject to the same tariffs and border controls like other non-eu countries . 
   the swiss seem to be doing alright . 
  except when they vote to stop freedom of movements for eu workers , which has the side-effect of invalidating the treaties switzerland has with eu . 
  if switzerland would follow the referendum they would lose access to the eu single market . 
  so switzerland did n't turn the result of the referendum into a law yet . 
  now they think about having another referendum about the future within the eu , which would then invalidate the last referendum . 
  that 's what happens if people think they vote on mass integration only . 
  in reality they voted on their future with the eu , and many have n't realized that . 
  that 's kind of my point . 
  some things should n't be decided by the people directly . 
  what do you think , how many of the voters in the greek referendum have read the proposal that they vote upon ? 
  i always have to laugh about these greek sob stories . 
  do you think romanians , poles , hungarians move to western europe because they love western europe so much ? 
  nope , they do it because of economic necessity . 
  and of course only proud greeks are insulted because of their nationality . 
  people would never insult the `` polish plumber '' , that actually works in electrical engineering , with jokes about stealing cars . 
  exactly . 
  what would be the greek reaction if all those greek-hating bild-readers in the rest of europe were asked if greece should get a deal that is so favorable for greece ? 
  the funny thing is that greece would n't need a referendum if we would let people decide the fate of greece . 
  they would have been kicked out of the eu long time ago . 
  we 're ready . 
  we just added a panther tank , a flak cannon and a torpedo to our arsenal . 
  there would be more post-communist countries . 
  if there even would be post-communism . 
  communism was the reason why west germany received such good terms . 
  greeks do n't want a real union . 
  they want to decide their own policy , and others should pay for it . 
  that 's not how a union works . 
  if there would be eu rules for taxation and an eu authority would enforce these rules , greece would cry nazi . 
  west germany was more important for the creditors than greece currently is . 
  that 's why west germany could negotiate better terms . 
  that 's the sad reality . 
  if greece would be cut in half and the eastern part would belong to the eurasian union , the eurozone would prop up the western part immediately . 
  and if things go really bad , you have to add `` un food aid '' somewhere between 2019 and 2020 . 
  he dropped his iphone and the screen broke . 
  and productivity is halved , because everything has to be typed two times . 
  if you do n't want austerity , who is going to pay ? 
   yes and no . 
  people feel good about ukrainians ( and belarusians but it 's harder for them ) , warsaw pact countries in general . 
  great . 
  so poland can still participate in the refugee quota . 
  we just make sure that their share of asylum seekers consists of people from ukraine , belarus and russia .
