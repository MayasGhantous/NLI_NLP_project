  that wo n't happen to the money you have in your pocket . 
  why is it that all sources ( german and english ) to this so called speech are n't older than 3 years ? 
  there is an interesting story about one of these national seed banks . 
  in 1941 , the world largest bank was in leningrad ( now st. petersburg ) . 
  when german troops blockaded leningrad , a group of soviet scientists brought a cross section of all the seeds they had stored into the basement . 
  the scientists then guarded them in shifts . 
  neither the enemy nor the hungry population of leningrad should destroy the collection . 
  the scientists believed the seed collection was essential to restart agriculture after the war . 
  they refused to eat the seeds they protect . 
  many of them starved themselves to death , sitting in the middle of boxes and bags with grains , rice and potatoes .

   syrizas message and moto was that they did not want those measures , they will pay back their debt but without conditions . 
  if they were able to do that they would n't need to follow any conditions . 
  they could just pay every installment and everyone would be happy . 
  the problem is that greece ca n't do that . 
  they need more money to pay their debt . 
  and they will only get that money if they adhere to rules . 
  do n't go to austria . 
  come to east germany . 
  if you look outside the big cities we have plenty of opportunities for young people who are smart , reliable and willing to learn . 
  friends of mine have hired refugees from afghanistan , syria and nigeria because they were n't able to find germans who are willing to do an apprenticeship with them . 
  so do n't hesitate . 
   but at the same time , getting out of the euro will give the greek government more freedom to decide what to do to its own country . 
  and perhaps the government might take some actions to ease the burden on the poorer people . 
  if the government of tsipras undo the austerity measures , that will mean that lots of things will become cheaper , so that is good . 
  and all of that is paid by printing just a little bit more money whenever the government needs to finance one of these social systems ? 
   i do n't know what is meant by `` advance payment '' it probably just means that individuals/businesses do n't pay all the taxes for one year the next year . 
  instead they pay their anticipated taxes in smaller installments throughout the year . 
  that 's how it works for businesses and self-employed people in germany . 
  after you reach a revenue threshold , you have to pay sales tax and local business tax four times a year . 
  calculation base are the revenue and income of last year . 
  so if tax laws stay the same , you pay a quarter of the taxes you owed last year every quarter of the year . 
  if the revenue changes significantly you can request to change the calculation base . 
  at the end of the year you get back what you paid too much , and if you paid too little you have to pay what you owe . 
   you realize the last time your country entered a great depression you decided to brutally murder 40 million people right ? 
  greece just wants economic independence and to escape its great depression that has been raging for almost a decade now . 
  holy shit . 
  looks like you are already bringing out the big guns . 
  that 's not populist enough . 
  should have added some holocaust to the rape . 
  so no source . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  the wikileaks fan greekemmy just misremembered the article they read . 
  i can pretty much guarantee that juncker would have said similar things if germany would hold a referendum to decide if greece should be allowed to stay in the eurozone . 
   11,000 suicides since 2010 source for that ? 
  did you misread an article about the study that investigated more than 11,000 greek suicides in the last 30 years ? 
   results from a 30-year `` time series '' study of more than 11,000 suicides in greece showed that specific austerity-related events were linked to significant increases in the number of suicides in that country . 
   http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/839425 the study showed that the suicide rate in greece increased a lot , but it is still less than half of what it is in bavaria . 
  except if you have an economy that heavily relies on imports . 
  like greece . 
  the will of greeks . 
  other europeans ca n't vote in that referendum . 
  i would love to see the reactions from greece if the rest of the eurozone could have a referendum if greece should be ** allowed ** to stay in the euro . 
  i doubt that any greek who works or studies in the eu will be forced to return to greece . 
  it 's one thing to not accept new people that want to migrate from non-eu greece . 
  that 's not a big deal . 
  but sending greeks home will put a huge burden on businesses in the rest of the union . 
  they obviously rely on the greek people they have employed . 
  it might be different for greeks that live in the eu and just receive social benefits . 
  but even they will probably receive a chance to stay . 
  i doubt that greeks that are integrated in their new home country will be deported . 
  i would n't worry too much . 
  but nobody knows how a eu-exit will turn out . 
  but no matter what happens , you will have enough time to sort things out . 
  it 's not like the police pulls you out of your bed to deport you , the day greece leaves the eu . 
  we do n't even do that with asylum seekers that got their applications denied . 
  that 's what nazi-sch\u00e4uble and nazi-merkel do . 
  if they leave the euro they will get more of this progress . 
  greece has a massive external trade deficit , they import ( $ 60b , 2013 ) almost twice as much as they export ( $ 33b ) . 
  and greece wants that too . 
  they want free healthcare , a secure job for everyone , high wages , a good social safety net , early retirement age , high pensions , and many other things that cost a lot of money . 
  and they want all of that without an economy that can ( or is willing to ) pay for it . 
  of course we have to work longer , how else could greeks afford to retire early ? 
  it 's called solidarity . 
  we do n't have beautiful landscape that we can enjoy , when retired , anyway . 
  how would greeks react if the people in the eurozone could decide if greece is allowed to stay in the euro ? 
  they hate referendums so much , that sch\u00e4uble even suggested one back in may . 
   `` if the greek government thinks it must hold a referendum , then let it hold a referendum , '' the hardline minister said . 
  `` that might even be a helpful measure for the greek people to decide whether it is ready to accept what is necessary , or whether it wants something different . '', 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/11/eurozone-greece-schaeuble-idusb5n0vd02620150511 -- and now imagine the reaction of greece , greeks and reddit when the rest of the eurozone could have an referendum where they could decide if greece is ** allowed ** to stay in the euro . 
  if you look at their current economic data , a currency that devalues will kill plenty of what 's left . 
  they import almost twice as much as they export . 
  2013 , they imported goods worth $ 60.5 b , and they exported $ 33.8 b. 
  all eu countries , except denmark and uk , are obliged to join the euro . 
  it is all or nothing . 
   there are plenty of eu countries that do n't use the euro and all eu countries , except denmark and the united kingdom , are obliged to join the euro . 
  i do n't see how you can stop doing something if you have an obligation to do that something . 
   and as long as any currency conversion is voluntary and how would you force people to voluntarily agree to be paid in inflating new drachmas instead of stable euros ? 
   obviously greece would end up defaulting on a lot of debt owed to eu partners and banks and * banks * includes greek banks . 
  which will lead to greek banks going bankrupt , and they will take the savings of businesses and people with them . 
  in case of a default the only thing that keeps the banking system halfway intact is devaluation . 
  with voluntary conversions greece ca n't do that . 
  because nobody will volunteer . 
  and `` convert to new drachmas or you wo n't get your money back '' is not voluntarily . 
   they have to lend money only to pay the interest of their depts . 
  so like every other country in the world ? 
  poor greeks . 
  this would turn greece into the north korea of europe . 
  isolated without any trust and without real allies . 
  they would n't be able to do business with anyone .
