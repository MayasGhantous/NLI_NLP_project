  and at the same time i would feel some comfort because i know that i could buy russian gas via germany if russia shuts down the pipelines . 
   as long as we can put a cap on it , and if it ever starts going the other way they can do likewise - then there is no issue . 
  300,000 + net a year though is unlikely to happen from such a smaller union . 
  sounds like a really great union . 
  `` we wo n't veto proposals , if we get the option to unilaterally suspend any agreement if we feel like it '' . 
  be aware , they might want to implement freedom of movement , and then all the polish plumbers invade the uk again . 
   they 're supposed to be a group that helps the member states , especially with trade and so on does `` and so on '' cover the problems that arise if you have to host ten-thousands of asylum seekers ? 
  the eu is a bit more than a trade union . 
  did poland request help ? 
  as far as i know these 400,000 ukrainians are in poland with work visa . 
  they do n't sit in a refugee center and wait until their asylum application is decided . 
  if whitegenocideproject.com says it , it must be true . 
  four decades . 
  absolutely . 
  that 's why germany should leave the eu . 
  we should end the euro-holocaust once and for all . 
  yeah . 
  because everything started three weeks ago . 
  before that literally no asylum seekers came to europe . 
  and none of the few hundred thousand that did n't came had wrong expectations about european realities . 
  all merkels fault . 
  the girlfriend of a dutch teenager left him for a german guy . 
  probably end of story . 
  and now spread the word amongst your peers . 
  first shock happens when they are brought to a reception facility that they ca n't choose . 
  they want berlin , and might end up in ludwigslust-parchim . 
  no need for scare quotes . 
  greece does not want to leave the eu . 
  that 's the lone reason why they accepted the bailout conditions . 
   they 're happy to help build refugee camps in turkey and jordan , the first safe countries of passge . 
   they 're happy to help build camps on the border of hungary and serbia . 
   they 're happy to send help to regions of syria where it 's still relatively safe . 
  of these 3 , which were already done by the czech republic ? 
  we call these bus stations busbahnhof . 
  not to be confused with a bus stop . 
  to little graffiti ( the bad kind ) for germany . 
  no piss stains , and i do n't see a group of alcoholics either . 
  because the refugee crisis literally started three weeks ago ? 
  gib gib gib gib gib followed by no no no no no, 
  and if you fold a stack of bank notes it 'll look [ similar ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/kjcimagery/kjcimagery1201/kjcimagery120100015/12151380-love-of-money-stack-of-folded-100-dollar-bills-one-shaped-like-a-heart-stock-photo.jpg ) . 
  here 's what the [ eu says about the dublin ii regulations ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=uriserv:l33153 )  if a member state to which an asylum application was submitted deems that another member state is responsible , ** it can ** call on that member state to take charge of the application . 
  maybe my english is a bit rusty , but i think `` it can '' does not imply an obligation . 
  so where exactly does germany ignore the dublin regulations ? 
  and then there 's that : [ hungary unilaterally suspends eu asylum seeker rules ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/r-hungary-unilaterally-suspends-eu-asylum-seeker-rules-2015-6?ir=t )  vienna ( reuters ) - hungary has unilaterally suspended european union asylum rules that require it to take back refugees who first enter hungary , then travel to other countries , a government spokesman said in a prepared statement . 
  that 's actually a violation of the dublin regulations . 
  because , let me quote the eu  the member state designated as responsible for the asylum application ** must ** take charge of the applicant and process the application . 
  maybe you should try to punish other countries first ? 
  -- and if germany enforced the dublin regulations to the full extent we would have received a few thousand asylum applications last year , instead of 200,000 . 
  and this year we would have received a few thousand instead of 250,000 as well . 
  you want to punish germany for not sending hundred thousands of asylum seekers back to greece , italy , malta and hungary ? 
  many . 
  over the last months 40 % of our asylum seekers are from balkan countries . 
  though the numbers went down a bit in recent months . 
  in august 35.2 % ( 11773 persons ) of the first asylum applicants in germany were from albania , serbia , macedonia , kosovo , bosnia and herzegovina , and montenegro . 
  the numbers of first asylum applications in germany for the first 8 months of 2015 : - albania : 37669 ( +631.3 % in comparison to jan-aug 2014 ) - kosovo : 30720 ( +1026.1 % ) - serbia : 13096 ( +35.9 % ) - macedonia : 6447 ( +80.9 % ), 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/r-hungary-unilaterally-suspends-eu-asylum-seeker-rules-2015-6?ir=t  hungary has unilaterally suspended european union asylum rules that require it to take back refugees who first enter hungary , then travel to other countries , a government spokesman said in a prepared statement . 
   [ ... ]  today 's suspension means hungary is refusing to take back refugees who landed in hungary , then traveled to another country . 
  so far this year , more than 60,000 immigrants have crossed into hungary illegally , the government said . 
  that was 2 months before merkel `` invited '' all asylum seekers . 
  -- http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-germany-kosovo-migrants-iduskbn0lg21h20150212  the eu has seen a sharp rise in the number of kosovo citizens smuggling themselves into the bloc especially since a relaxation of travel rules allowing them to reach eu borders via serbia . 
  some 10,000 kosovars filed for asylum in hungary in just one month this year , many fleeing from poverty and unemployment . 
  that was more than half a year before merkel `` invited '' all asylum seekers . 
  -- http://budapestbeacon.com/public-policy/german-court-hungary-does-not-meet-minimum-eu-asylum-standards/10300  the german judiciary body granted the right to an iranian refugee coming from hungary to seek asylum in germany , based on the argument , that `` hungary does not meet minimum standards of asylum required by the eu '' . 
  that was more than a year before merkel `` invited '' all asylum seekers . 
  but of course , everything started 3 weeks ago . 
  merkel is not the vice chancellor of germany . 
  and this is fucking why the only sensible solution is that germany leaves the eu . 
  no more euro-holocaust . 
  no more fourth reich . 
  solidarity is not a one way street . 
   who in their right mind makes major decisions to take in unlimited illegal migrants nobody . 
  merkel said that the law does not know a limit for legitimate refugees . 
  if , as many claim , they go to germany for the benefits and free housing , they will stay in eastern europe . 
  because they wo n't receive anything in germany if they are registered in eastern europe . 
  european values ... 
   firstly , he 's responding to her own statements . 
  he 's not . 
  he 's bending her statements to fit his narrative . 
  remove his bullshit from the video and the meaning of the whole thing changes . 
  the western part . 
  the southern part . 
  the asylum process requires personal interviews anyway . 
  even if there would be zero chance for fake passports , syrians would not receive asylum just because they are syrian . 
  it 's hard to prove that someone is from a specific country ( that 's why asylum seekers usually throw their passports away ) , but it 's pretty easy to prove that somewhat is not from a country . 
  just asking them a few questions about their alleged home town should be enough to figure out if someone is lying . 
  if you think it 's hard to protect the finnish-swedish border , think about the borders of greece , italy or malta . 
   our system collapsed weeks ago . 
  people have been living in tents since june . 
  june last year . 
  wasted money . 
  the government is n't that stupid , everyone knows that fake and stolen passports exist . 
  the proposal is way older than the `` invitation '' . 
  and that 's why they are an issue . 
  for germany they are actually one of the bigger problems . 
  40 % of the people that request asylum in germany are from balkan countries . 
  that means we basically need twice the infrastructure and twice the personnel , because they have to be hosted while their application is handled . 
  and the people from the balkans are also the ones that know very well how to exploit the system . 
  no one leaves after their initial rejection . 
  they all object the decision , they all try to go to court over the decision . 
  they all try stunts like getting babies as fast as possible so they can stay a few months longer .
