  because who knows if the rubles , yuan , us-dollars or euros they use to pay for goods are real . 
  and because of that threat they would be cut of from the international banking system . 
  a country that prints counterfeit money will create fake transactions as well . 
   it 's the same as this migrant quotas thing : would you imagine the us government sharing and sending its migrants in each state ? 
  i can imagine that . 
  because i think that 's exactly what they do . 
  http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/about/what-we-do http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/programs/coordinated-placement http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/news/key-indicators-for-refugee-placement-fy2016-report-released the majority of the refugees and asylum seekers that come to the us actually come by plane . 
  and the authorities already know where they put each refugee before they even entered the united stated . 
   saying that there are too many mexicans in texas and that they 'll be sent to oregon ? 
  bullshit comparison . 
  mexico is considered a safe country , and therefor nobody that enters via the us-mexican border is eligible for asylum . 
  texas can deport these illegal immigrants quickly , no need to resettle them to another state first . 
  europe ca n't do that , because the majority of people that enter europe illegally might actually be eligible for protection according to the un refugee convention . 
   im expecting 1.02 how much did you bet ? 
   please let it be young people in germany instead of young people in greece for a change . 
  fixed that for you, 
   it may bet better or it may get worse . 
  you could be so fucking rich if only you would know . 
  you can only retire 4 years early . 
  the first age group that is covered by the new age 67 legislation retires in 2031 . 
  then , the minimum early retirement age will be 63 years , and if trends continue the average will be in the ballpark of 65 years . 
  and how much less pensions will a greek receive if they retire at 61.4 years ? 
  for each month your retire early in germany , you will lose 0,3 % of your pensions , for the rest of your life . 
  up to 48 months , so 14.4 % loss . 
  any reason to believe that the opinion has changed significantly ? 
  are mr and mrs xxxpoulos more entitled to these 500 $ evaded taxes than the pensioner who would have received that money ? 
   1 ) why do i never hear about plans to create jobs in greece and other high unemployment eu countries . 
  this is the ** obvious ** answer to solving their economic problems . 
  if you created a million jobs there , then that would be another million taxpayers . 
  why is n't there a plan to create factory , tech , etc jobs in greece ( and other poorer countries ) so you are creating taxable income ? 
  so smart . 
  why has n't anyone thought about creating jobs before ? 
  ** just ** create a million jobs and all economic problems are solved . 
   they could used stamped euro notes as a first temporary measure . 
  at least that kind of paper has something like an intrinsic value . 
  but how many inflation re-stamps does it take to void an euro bill ? 
  greece was also part of the marshall plan . 
  should i start to judge the mindset of the average turkish immigrant on the basis of the german criminal statistics ? 
  if you do n't like our r\\/european values return to your home country !, 
  yeah . 
  strong leaders like kim jong-un would just ignore un conventions . 
  too bad our leaders are pussies . 
  we should send your facts back to their home country !, 
  they are against the values of r/europe, 
  would you like to live next to such a refugee camp that houses a couple thousand refugees ? 
  on the one side we complain that those damn foreigners do n't integrate . 
  and then we want to build fucking refugee camps that house thousands of people as tight together as possible . 
  if you throw people from different countries together into a shared sleeping tent for 30 people you will get tensions , that lead to violence , pretty fast . 
  nobody in europe wants refugee camps . 
  i live in the middle of a decentralized housing projects . 
  my small city of 25,000 got like 350 asylum seekers and refugees during the last 2 years . 
  280 of them are part of a decentralized housing project , they live all over the city in regular apartments . 
  and if you do n't look at the names next to the door bell you wo n't notice where they live . 
  the rest lives in a central housing project , and you will definitely notice them . 
  because they hang around in the vicinity of the center . 
  they are not aggressive or anything , but their mere presence is enough for some of my fellow countrymen to get annoyed . 
  if we had a central project with 350 people we would probably have a lot of rallies against that project . 
  yeah . 
  let 's turn europe into north korea . 
  un conventions and human rights are only good as long as they do n't cost us much . 
  muh european values, 
   the convention was made during different times and having different situations in mind . 
  please elaborate . 
  as we can see in syria wars still displace many people . 
  to help those people , was the sole reason the un refugee convention was created . 
  which countries do that ? 
  north korea and ? 
  but , but there are now two suicides a day in greece . 
  that 's almost half the rate of bavaria . 
  euro-holocaust !, 
  yeah . 
  everyone would buy citroen and fiat instead of bmw and mercedes if we would n't use economic world war iii to keep other economies down . 
  examples ? 
  you need a lawyer at every fucking voting center in greece ? 
  i think i start to understand why greece is in trouble . 
  but it 's the wrong question . 
  the question should be * should greece stay in the euro ? 
  a default while staying in the euro will not happen . 
  this combines the negative sides of the euro ( ca n't devalue your currency ) and a default ( lack of thrust , no access to cheap loans ) . 
  if you default your debt does n't vanish , it 's still there and you still have to pay it . 
  go ahead and do it . 
  in germany they wait until they are offered a place in a language and integration course . 
  the reality is that there are too many asylum seekers and too few teachers . 
  that was already a problem 5 years ago . 
  the number of asylum applications has more than quadrupled since them . 
  i live in the middle of a decentralized housing project , i.e. 
  refugees and asylum seekers living in regular apartments all over the city . 
  my neighbors are unhcr quota refugees from syria . 
  everyone speaks good german , the children go to kindergarten and school , recently the father started to work . 
  i have more neighbors , another family from syria , they came by boat , most likely they will receive asylum . 
  but they speak barely german , children did n't start school yet . 
  father is not allowed to work , but even if he would be , he is unemployable . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  are syrians more lazy or stupid than syrian ? 
  nope . 
  unhcr quota refugees receive priority access to things like language and integration courses . 
  the others are still on a waiting list . 
  you clearly have no idea what you 're talking about .
