  you give me 1000 $ today and 1005 $ tomorrow . 
  just 0.5 % growth . 
  in return i give you 1 $ today and 1000 $ tomorrow . 
  that 's 100000 % growth . 
  that 's what putin said to crimea and eastern ukraine . 
  that 's not what australia does . 
  they do n't take the ships back to their country of origin . 
  because asylum seekers are not illegal immigrants . 
  as soon as a person says `` i want to request asylum '' , they turn into an asylum seeker . 
  and you are no longer allowed to punish them for their illegal border crossing . 
  to comply with the un refugee convention you then have to check on a case by case base if that person is a legitimate asylum seekers . 
  because if they are , you have to protect them . 
   perhaps the eu should amend the echr to modify the requirement on refugee handling to make it less-vulnerable to economic migrants claiming refugee status , if this is such a fundamental issue ? 
  yeah . 
  a court that is able to overwrite un conventions and basic human rights is exactly what the world needs . 
  think of all the money we could save . 
   we do it legally though , ** and do not expect a cent ** you got ta be kidding . 
  the first thing an immigrant from eastern europe does when they come to germany is to check with the administrative bodies what benefits they can receive . 
  and why not . 
  the governments offer these benefits , so one should not be ashamed to make use of them . 
   but legally , at the invitation of the host govt . 
  so like refugees ? 
  because all host govt . 
  have ratified the un refugee convention . 
   basically that the vast majority of us do n't abandon the country just for economical reasons . 
  because we are all whiny pussies that are afraid of change . 
  but some of us are n't , in 2013 , 755,000 non-german eu-citizens moved to germany . 
  that number is higher than the number of people that requested asylum in 20 ** 14 ** in the whole eu ( 625,920 ) . 
  most immigrants in eu countries are from other eu countries . 
  but we all know , these are better immigrants . 
  because they have the right to be an economic migrants . 
  `` 20 people just transferred from our bus to another bus . 
  but our bus is still full . '', 
  i think the matter is decided in greece . 
  they can default in the eurozone . 
  but it would be incredibly stupid to do so . 
  they keep the negative sides of the euro and add the negative sides of a default to it . 
  / tl ; dr debt does not vanish just because you default . 
  you ca n't start fresh just because you unilaterally declare that you want to default . 
  greece still owes the loans . 
  debt might be forgiven , and the rest might be restructured . 
  but that does n't happen because you default , that happens because you negotiate with your creditors . 
  but there are a couple things that are unavoidable after a greek default . 
  greek banks wo n't have access to the ecb emergency liquidity assistance anymore , that 's money that is transferred to greek banks so people can withdraw money from their bank accounts . 
  without that transfer , the banks will run out of money within hours . 
  so greece has to impose capital controls . 
  that means nobody will bring money to the bank . 
  people will just avoid doing transactions that do n't include exchanging real physical money . 
  the default destroyed their credit rating , the lack of euros destroyed the economy . 
  the chance of a grexit on top of that is very high , so you would be stupid to keep your savings in a bank account that will be converted . 
  the greek state just declared that it wo n't pay back its debt . 
  and because the greek banks did lend money to the greek state the banks are now insolvent . 
  many greek banks will go bankrupt , and they will take the savings of their customers with them . 
  and this time the tax payer wo n't help . 
  the greek banking system will collapse . 
  businesses just lost their savings and ca n't pay wages . 
  taxes are n't paid , the government has no money to pay pensioners and salaries . 
  taxes are n't paid . 
  and so on . 
  if they default and leave the euro they can create money out of nowhere , which solves a lot of problems . 
  internal debt ? 
  the 1000 $ loan will be converted to 1000 new drachmas on the day of the default , and the next day you can buy 1000 new drachmas for 900 $ . 
  compared to the euro , you just gave yourself a 10 % haircut on internal debt . 
  and at the same time you cut the pensions by 10 % . 
  but you also cut salaries and wages by 10 % , so the new drachma would improve competitiveness . 
  vacation in greece just got cheaper , and some of the export products got cheaper . 
  but that 's where the advantages of leaving the euro end . 
  there is a high risk the new drachma will devalue very quickly . 
  people will be able to afford domestic products . 
  but things that have to be imported become more expensive . 
  which is not a good idea for a country that imports almost double the amount they export . 
  that will cripple the economy further . 
   women on waves , an amsterdam-based women 's rights group , will launch an unmanned aerial vehicle from frankfurt , germany , saturday , carrying mifepristone and misoprostol to an unidentified spot near slubice , poland . 
  i would have been more impressed if that frankfurt would n't be frankfurt ( oder ) . 
  the distance between frankfurt ( oder ) and s\u0142ubice is literally the width of the oder . 
  because everyone gets pissed if they see the compromises that were made . 
  `` every canadian gets a bottle of beer for free '' . 
  that 's great , you say . 
  but if people read the original proposal that was revised by the other party , they get angry that the canadian government gave in . 
  `` every canadian gets a ~ ~ six pack ~ ~ * bottle * of beer for free ~ ~ , every week ~ ~ . '', 
  want to exchange bank accounts ? 
  does it even matter ? 
  i though nuclear weapons are means of last resort . 
  and you should fire all of them because most likely that 's the last thing your country can do . 
  so the baltic states can choose between a direct nuclear missile attack and fallout from attacks on europe and russia . 
  i doubt that russia and the us will fire only a couple nuclear missiles at each other . 
  according to ( wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sea_monster ) it was made by [ sebastian m\u00fcnster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sebastian_m\u00fcnster ) , a german cartographer from the 16th century it 's a recap of the decorative monsters from the [ carta marina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carta_marina ), 
  put huge sharks , electric eels , salt water crocodiles , man-eating lobsters , love-seeking manatees and other sea monsters into the mediterranean sea . 
  if it looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/m\u00fcnster_thier_2.jpg ) they wo n't try to cross . 
  did he offer his help ? 
  i 'm sure greece and italy would welcome the advice such an expert on maritime borders could give . 
  i hope they update that number in the future . 
  in a couple of years , 40 should be the new young . 
  because people drew the wrong conclusion . 
  they would watch how another country creates a fourth reich that mirrors the 3rd one exactly . 
  and they would sit there and watch , because `` nie wieder krieg '' . 
  `` we laugh about sanctions . 
  sanctions are not hurting us . 
  not even little bit . 
  sanctions not working .
