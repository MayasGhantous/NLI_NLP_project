  no , and i 'm not sure if that will happen . 
  the german government usually does not comment on things private companies plan to do . 
  especially if the only thing they did was to sign a memorandum . 
  the title of the article sounds like this is a government project and construction will start tomorrow . 
  that 's not the case . 
  that 's why i posted the full list , 
  here 's the list of receiving countries :  remittance outflows from ireland in 2014 :   1 . 
  poland $ 217m  3 . 
  lithuania $ 142m  4 . 
  india $ 85m  5 . 
  china $ 72m  6 . 
  hungary $ 64m  7 . 
  slovak republic $ 38m 10 czech republic $ 35m -- i 'm not sure how i should think about remittance . 
  on the one side that money is removed from the domestic economy forever . 
  on the other side this money does good things in the countries that receive it . 
  the receivers probably use all of it . 
  at the beginning of the year , a german organization that does product tests ( stiftung warentest ) checked 21 pre-packaged minced meat products . 
  half of them contained bacteria and other germs that should n't be there , some of them relatively harmless , some of them more harmful . 
  10 years ago there was a huge scandal , where some stores of a supermarket chain repackaged minced meat that reached its expiration date . 
  i would not trust german quality control . 
  the average german would choose cheap over better quality . 
  and plenty of businesses would risk the health of a customer just so they do n't have to throw away meat . 
  it 's only 1 day , right ? 
  besides that , minced meat in a supermarket plastic tray just does n't look appetizing . 
  it has a pale color and i 'm pretty sure they add extra water . 
  though that could be because they add ice to cool their machines . 
  but all in all it looks very industrialized and not appetizing . 
  the meat i get from my butcher was minced in his shop just a few hours before i buy it . 
  when i 'm cooking i use supermarket meat as well . 
  but i would n't eat it raw . 
  -- to clarify , i 'm talking about pre-packaged meat . 
  there are supermarkets that have an attached butchery , i would buy there . 
   from the very begging . 
  freud would be proud . 
  maybe we should make the use of / r/europe mandatory . 
  plenty of the things i thought to know about other europeans were proven wrong since i read and post here . 
  it 's incredible how much you learn if you look things up to prove others wrong on the internet . 
  i do . 
  but definitely not from supermarket meat . 
  but many people are not aware of the dangers of cross contamination . 
  they cut their raw pork . 
  and later they cut the bell peppers for the side salad on the same cutting board with the same knife . 
  et voil\u00e0 , salad that contains mrsa . 
  she hopes that the french authorities do n't think she 's a russian asset . 
  we should construct one or two lng regasification terminals instead . 
  no need to increase the dependency on russian gas . 
  yeah . 
  i just checked the news . 
  he was white . 
  so it was either a parking dispute or a lone wolf that did n't take his medication . 
  great website . 
  i like this article : [ north korea , a land of human achievement , love and joy ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/north-korea-a-land-of-human-achievement-love-and-joy/5344960 ) this one is also good : [ rejection of israeli atrocities : germany prints stamps of palestinian iconic cartoon ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/germany-prints-stamps-of-palestinian-iconic-cartoon-2/5456516 ) in reality the stamp was created by a private person . 
  `` briefmarke individuell '' is a product by deutsche post that allows everyone to design a real stamp .

   i wonder , what 's the motivation for turkey in stopping these migrants ? 
  turkey wants eu money for the refugee camps . 
  and turkey wants visa free travel in the eu . 
  so it 's better to work together with the eu . 
  eu and turkey already signed a deal ( not yet ratified ) about returning illegal immigrants that enter via turkey . 
  greece, 
  you get language experts and let them interview the asylum seeker . 
  ( that 's what they already do if someone `` lost '' their papers and ca n't remember in which country they were born ), 
   if they want to leave , they want to leave . 
  if they do n't , they do n't . 
  we already have free trade and movement agreements with them and them with us , so on that front it would n't change a whole lot . 
  in that case you have to leave with them . 
  let me quote the eu parliament about [ * the european union and its trade partners * ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/displayftu.html?ftuid=ftu_6.2.1.html ) :  international trade was one of the first sectors in which eu member states agreed to pool their sovereignty . 
  they charged the commission with the responsibility of handling trade matters , including negotiating international trade agreements , on their behalf . 
  in other words , the eu , acting as a single entity , negotiates both bilateral and multilateral trade agreements on behalf of all its member states . 
  as long as ireland is a member of the eu , it can not have its own trade agreements with other countries . 
  ireland gave the right to decide about trade agreements to the european commission . 
  only two suicides a day ? 
  that would cut the actual rate for bavaria ( 1727 in 2013 ) in half . 
  i guess greece is n't that bad ? 
  bavaria ( population 12.7 million ) , greece ( 10.8 million ) [ . 
  the cdu gives little projects to the csu , so they are busy and do n't talk to the press about real issues . 
  they finished the toll system too early , and the eu investigations have n't started yet . 
  now they do n't know what to do and talk to the press . 
  i 'm not an expert , but tariffs are usually determined by examining the country of origin . 
  if it was produced in china the importer has to pay the tariffs for china , even if the import entered the eu via iceland . 
  there are strict wto rules how `` made in china '' can turn into `` made in switzerland '' . 
  it requires a major transformation , putting stickers on it or putting it in a box is not sufficient . 
  technohead ? 
  are n't they from england ?

  not sure what you mean with domestic , so i choose german stuff only . 
  these are the songs that people asked me to play a couple days ago ( i 'm not a dj , i just stand next to him ) old : [ die atzen - das geht ab ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwp84kton4 ) cool : [ deichkind - like mich am arsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovvhj1flcn4 ) new : [ die orsons - schwung in die kiste ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoekasp2268 ) ( nice video too ) `` hate '' : [ helene fischer - atemlos durch die nacht ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2czabfw6rne ), 
  the german court would call it `` glorification of nazi atrocities '' . 
  which could be another criminal offence . 
  swastikas are banned outside of historical context ( e.g. 
  museums , history books , documentary films ) and education ( e.g. 
  school books ) . 
  and that 's it . 
  you get a bit more leeway if you cross it out , or change it in a way that it 's clear that the depiction has a anti-nazi message . 
  or you make a popular movie . 
  outside of that you do n't have much chance to show swastikas . 
  we ban games that show swastikas , and in most of these games you actually have to kill nazis . 
  movies have more freedom in that regard . 
  but it ends right there . 
  if you look at the inglorious bastard dvds covers and movie posters you notice it misses a couple swastikas in the german version .
