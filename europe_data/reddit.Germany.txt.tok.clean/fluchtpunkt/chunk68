  that 's also the reason why you only see poor and unemployed immigrants if you walk through these `` ghettos '' . 
  as soon as people get a job that allows them to move , they move . 
  if you want to see muslim engineers , lawyers and doctors you have to go to the suburbs with the big single-family houses . 
  i would give a shit about that and i would totally fly via one of these airports . 
  the combination of my job ( self employed in software ) and my travel plans ( my friend in the us owns a software company , i stay at his house ) often look suspicious to the average cbp agent . 
  i have been to the secondary immigration check multiple times . 
  if i talk to the officer there i always get cleared pretty fast . 
  the problem with that secondary check is waiting time , my longest wait was around 5 hours . 
  if i can save a couple hours because i can tell my 10 minute story before flight i will plan my flight accordingly . 
   nope we have borders for a reason . 
  and we ratified the un refugee convention for a reason . 
  because even non-eu citizens are human being , and sometimes some of them need protection . 
  go to said house and say `` help , somebody tries to kill me . 
  can you please protect me ? '', 
  it would be a disgrace for everything europe stands for . 
  - international convention on maritime search and rescue - un convention relating to the status of refugees, 
  yep german grandmother , 65 , gives birth to quadruplets http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/24/europe/germany-grandmother-quadruplets/ she now has 17 children . 
   anyone else share my arrogant ignorance ? 
  yes . 
  but i treat other countries equally `` bad '' . 
  - canada = = usa - new zealand = = australia - every uk country = = england - portugal = = spain - czech republic = = slovakia = = poland - latvia = = lithuania = = estonia - belarus = = ukraine = = moldova - norway = = finland = = sweden - luxembourg = = belgium - former yugoslavia = = yugoslavia - kazakhstan = = georgia = = azerbaijan = = armenia = = russia - lebanon = = jordan = = syria - every country in africa except egypt and south africa = = africa and so on . 
  yes i 'm an ignorant asshole . 
   greeks ca n't just spiral into inflation like the past and boosts their industrial or commercial exports . 
  great idea for a country that imports almost twice as much as it exports . 
  contrary to popular believe greece top export products are neither ouzo , feta nor olive oil . 
  in 2013 their most important export product was refined oil , worth a whopping 11.8 billion us-dollar and 34.91 % of their exports . 
  next important product were packaged medicaments worth 1 billion usd and 3.1 % of their exports . 
  greece biggest import was crude oil , worth 14.4 billion usd , or 23.76 % of their imports . 
  greece imports crude oil , refines it and exports what it does n't need . 
  what happens to that part of the economy if you spiral into inflation ? 
  inflation is not a magic bullet to improve your foreign trade .

  migrant and refugee are not synonyms . 
  we have to keep taking refugees forever . 
  that 's our job as a bunch of countries that all have ratified the un refugee convention . 
  we do n't have to take any migrants that are not refugees . 
  and guess what , we do n't do that . 
  that 's why there is an asylum process that takes months . 
  its sole purpose is to figure out which person is a legitimate refugee and who is n't . 
  the latter can and will be send home . 
  if you want to stop economic migrants from trying to enter you have to kick them out faster . 
  that worked in germany . 
  since we decide all , and decline most , asylum applications from kosovo within 14 days , asylum seekers from kosovo went down to almost zero . 
  before that , decisions took months or even years . 
  and they used that time to get the free benefits . 
  now their trip is more expensive than the benefits they will receive . 
  so they do n't come anymore . 
  -- the real problem is that the majority of the asylum seekers that cross the mediterranean sea actually qualify as refugees . 
  and we need to find a solution that stops them from coming without violating human rights and the un refugee convention . 
  and that 's where things get complicated because the populistic `` send them home '' does n't work anymore . 
  everyone , please investigate and then sue us . 
  german government is too much of a coward to ignore what the us wants . 
  but if eu courts force us to say * no * we can fall back to `` it 's not our fault , we are just following orders '' . 
  i would recommend you shut down all your factories so you can rank higher in that list . 
  we would n't mind to take last place . 
   2 ) a retirement fund could invest in things that are stable in value . 
  what would that be ? 
  invest in the housing and stock market and pray that it does n't crash within the next 50 years ? 
  or do you want to buy things like gold ? 
  if the majority of the gold is bought for retirement funds you have the same problem as today . 
  you will basically sell your gold to someone who wants to put it into his own retirement fund . 
  fewer young people , less demand , and your gold is n't worth as much as you thought . 
   i think that another important factor is that parents who do have children tend to have less . 
  so we just have to invent a chemical that increases the chance of triplets . 
  if we put that into the drinking water it will solve our problems . 
  do you want to try to be a productive member of society ? 
  then yes , please come to germany . 
  europe and north america , basically all industrialized nations do n't have a problem with overpopulation . 
  but at least in germany pensions are paid by the working people . 
  without children the ratio between pension paying and pension receiving people will shift towards the receiving end . 
  which means young people have to pay more and more money to care for the elderly . 
  this problem is increased by the improvements in health care . 
  people will get older . 
  which requires more medical attention , which costs more money . 
  germanys fertility rate is below 2.1 since the 1970 . 
  do you have an easy solution ? 
  because we try to solve that problem for a couple decades already . 
  low fertility is nothing new , and i 'm pretty sure we have the lowest birth rate because japan has improved . 
  at least germany is still very attractive for migrants . 
  the people that come from poland , romania , bulgaria , hungary and all the other countries should ease the problem a bit . 
  in 2013 we had a migration balance of +430,000 people . 
  so at least we do n't lose people because of death ** and ** migration . 
   which , let 's be honest , are very likely to be undereducated . 
  what is more , the refugees are disproportionally represented with most of them being young males . 
  they are undereducated but not stupid . 
  you can train them . 
  that 's what we would have to do with a german who just finished school as well . 
  believe it or not , not everyone in the middle east or africa lives in an isolated village without access to education . 
  and you do n't need an university degree to work in a machine building shop , for a supplier for the car industry or in a logistics company . 
  most apprenticeships only require 9 years of school . 
  there are plenty of companies in germany that ca n't find people who want to make an apprenticeship with them . 
  they are pretty happy about these undereducated immigrants . 
  if they become fully assimilated germans they do n't want kids . 
   kids need space . 
  there is massive space in front of your front door . 
  that 's where i spent most of my childhood . 
  kids neither need big apartments nor houses . 
  you are a couple years late . 
  the number of turks leaving germany is currently higher than the number of turks coming to germany . 
  we currently import people from poland , romania , bulgaria , hungary , italy , spain , greece , russia and basically every country in the world .
