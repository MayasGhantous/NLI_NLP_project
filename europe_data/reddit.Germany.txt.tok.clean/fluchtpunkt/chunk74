  where can i read more about this ? 
  merkel will still be kanzler, 
  in this case it could n't be more relevant . 
  an even more hostile conflict in ukraine is not in the interest of the eu . 
  otherwise we would already be there . 
  there is nothing that stops eu countries from intervening individually . 
  it looks like poland ( s defence minister ) wants to go to war , but they wo n't be able to handle it alone . 
  so they want to force other nato members to join . 
  and that is something that wo n't happen . 
  if members can be forced to intervene in conflicts that do n't directly threaten other members there will be no eu army . 
  if nato want 's to do the same it will fall apart . 
  germany will leave in any case . 
  if we look at iraq france will probably follow . 
  and i doubt that countries like uk , italy , spain , portugal and greece have a lot of interest to fight the wars of eastern europe . 
  nato should n't be a chess game , and nato should n't be used to influence global politics . 
  it should stay a defense-only alliance . 
  why should a country join nato if it knows it will be protected regardless of a membership . 
  what kind of alliance should that be ? 
  as i said , if you want to intervene in conflicts create a coalition of the willing and go for it . 
  that 's how it was done in iraq , libya and basically every conflict with nato troops except afghanistan . 
  yeah . 
  fuck those stupid constitutional rights . 
  governments should have the power to ignore the constitution and remove citizenships as they please . 
  i do n't see a problem . 
  this time the people that get their citizenship removed are n't even jews . 
   in an allusion to ukraine 's lack of nato membership , siemoniak said that `` the alliance can not be limited just to activities that concern the security of its members . 
  yes it can . 
  that 's the whole point of nato . 
  just create a new alliance that can intervene wherever it sees need . 
  i already have a name for you . 
  coalition of the willing . 
  probably a turbine that rotates on a vertical axis . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vertical_axis_wind_turbine or even things like the [ windbelt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/windbelt ) wikipedia has a nice collection of other [ unconventional wind turbines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unconventional_wind_turbines ), 
   the bigger problem currently seems to be that the lowest tier ( out of three ) of secondary school degrees is getting less and less useful as qualification for job/apprenticeship applications . 
  basically for the reasons mentioned by sharklazers99 . 
  if you get your high-school diploma you can choose between university and apprenticeship . 
  if you leave school after 10 years you are limited for the rest of your life . 
  in saxony we currently try `` duale berufsausbildung mit abitur '' , which sounds like a great idea . 
  instead of getting your high-school diploma after 12 years of school and additional 3 years of apprenticeship , you can get both in 14 years total . 
  let 's face it , if you go to university after doing a apprenticeship in the same field you have a much better qualification for real world jobs than someone who only went to university . 
  but it helps . 
  says the canadian ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_mobile, 
   so do they really think eu will just go there and sink all boats with out having their permission first . 
  yes , most likely the eu will do exactly that . 
  if the un allows it nobody gives a fuck about the opinion of libya . 
  you know , like in [ 2011 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya ) . 
  maybe they need a new deal every month ? 
  when i received benefits while being self-employed the people at the job center asked for a result-adjusted business forecast nearly every month , too . 
  if your moral does not allow you to educate people about safe practice people will still do it , but in a unsafe way . 
   wnd ( formerly worldnetdaily or , as it was affectionately known to its fans , wingnutdaily or whirlednutdaily ) is an extremist conservative website founded by joseph farah in 1997 as a project of his western center for journalism . 
  [ 1 ] it espouses a fundamentalist christian , creationist view of the world , and regularly engages in racist attacks against african-americans . 
  its political leanings are right-wing , pro- `` christian right , '' and supposedly pro-united states , with strongly libertarian economic views . 
  its coverage provides multiple sides of the issues : the conservative viewpoint and the ultra-conservative viewpoint . 
  it is far to the right of fox news . 
  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/wnd -- their best one is [ no longer available ] ( http://www.wnd.com/2011/07/325069/ ) on their website . 
   the islamic news angle , savage said , has faded from the press since breivik was fingered , even though the lone norwegian committing both crimes seems to savage a suspect possibility `` the official story makes no sense , '' savage told wnd . 
  `` this looks like a classic conspiracy . '', 
    `` this has all the appearances of a cover-up , '' savage told wnd . 
  `` they created their reichstag fire . 
  they found their timothy mcveigh . 
  they created their jack ruby . 
  how could one man have blown up the downtown and then raced to the island to kill the teens ? 
    `` this is likely a fabrication of the labour party , who needs to hold onto power to enforce their multi-culturalist , muslim-favoring , anti-nationalist views , '' he continued , `` especially in light of the earlier ` credit ' for this atrocity claimed by the radical muslim group whose leader they were threatening to deport . 
    `` the official story defies logic in the following sense as well , '' he continued , `` if this lone right-winger hated muslims , as the new york times is reporting , then why did he slaughter his own people and not muslims ? '', 
    ...   savage said `` norway 's 9/11 '' could have been stopped , `` but it grew far too long , nourished by the bile of eurosocialism . '', 
    `` i hoped that incidents like this , '' he said , `` will lead europeans to come to the defense of their own civilizations and clamp down on the hate and intolerance that takes perverse advantage of european tolerance and openness . '',

  there will always be houseboats . 
  yes . 
  all the wind resources will be packed into bags and shipped to germany . 
  bavaria needs it . 
  is n't the weed that is sold in nl mostly grown in germany anyway ? 
   does anyone want to trade citizenship with me ? 
  i would . 
  in a heartbeat as well . 
  unfortunately that 's not how this works . 
  otherwise i would have gotten us citizenship years ago . 
  ideas are pretty much worthless without good execution . 
  that 's something were silicon valley , and the us in general , stand out . 
  they are very good at turning ideas into products . 
  just look at mp3 . 
  it 's roots are in germany , but the us turned it into products . 
  and they earned hundreds of billions with it . 
  this . 
  if you leave the trading of goods there is no single market in the eu . 
  if you offer services the eu consists of 28 different markets which all have their own laws . 
  if we are talking about internet startups you end in lawyer and contract hell if you want to cater to the whole eu . 
  you want to found facebook ? 
  you have to deal with 28 different privacy laws , 28 different copyright laws and so on . 
  you want to found netflix ? 
  you have to make licensing deals with 28 different branches of each media company that is out there . 
  sony france , sony germany , sony spain , sony poland and so on . 
  additionally you have to deal with 28 collecting societies that all want some money from you . 
  to execute your idea you need the best talent . 
  that 's why you go to silicon valley and not berlin . 
  i 'm not necessarily talking about tech talent . 
  startup is not another term for `` recently founded company '' . 
  if you open a restaurant you do n't own a startup , you own a small business . 
  my own little company was never a startup , i had a business model right from the beginning . 
  i made profit the same year i founded .
