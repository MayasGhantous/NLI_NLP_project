  we are really really really angry because we are no longer allowed to say things like `` they look dirty , they should all take a shower . 
  without water . 
  '' , `` we do n't mourn , we celebrate !, 
  [ about the kid on the beach ] '' , `` 71 deaths are not enough . 
  we have to send them more trucks '' , `` refugees should be shot !, 
  '' , `` we could open a refugee camp in auschwitz '' . 
  / s obviously, 
  without established nationality you will not receive asylum . 
  your deportation will be suspended . 
  and in the current situation your free housing will probably be a 10 square meter room that you have to share with at least one other person . 
  but you get the welfare check . 
  which is less than hartz 4 . 
  and people who receive hartz 4 complain constantly that this is not enough money . 
  but you will be totally rich . 
  just have to ask for your eastern europe discount at the checkout . 
  she was `` just '' an informal collaborator , as were 189,000 of other gdr citizen . 
  i do n't care about the emotions of eastern europe . 
  i sincerely believe that the 2004 enlargement of the eu was at least a decade too early . 
   my personal view on the matter is that if germany/austria go ahead with imposed mandatory quotas , even if the eastern block loses on qualified majority votes , we will see referendums proposed to leave / quit the eu . 
  yes please . 
  i want my eu15 back . 
  and according to the german federal migration office , 10,112 of the 33,447 asylum applications that were first filed in august 2015 came from syrians . 
  so yes . 
  less than a third . 
  30 % to be exact . 
  and if we look at the first 8 months of 2015 it 's 52892 of 231302 , or 23 % . 
  the relative increase happened because people from kosovo realized that it 's pointless to request asylum in germany . 
   they pay more a month for doing nothing than the majority of people make in eastern europe working . 
  you have to pay swedish prices . 
  you wo n't get a discount if you say that you are from eastern europe . 
  of course not , because hungary has never cared much about containing asylum seekers in hungary . 
  how did ten-thousands of people from kosovo ended in germany if not via hungary ? 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/r-hungary-unilaterally-suspends-eu-asylum-seeker-rules-2015-6?ir=t  hungary has unilaterally suspended european union asylum rules that require it to take back refugees who first enter hungary , then travel to other countries , a government spokesman said in a prepared statement . 
   [ ... ]  today 's suspension means hungary is refusing to take back refugees who landed in hungary , then traveled to another country . 
  so far this year , more than 60,000 immigrants have crossed into hungary illegally , the government said . 
  that was 2 months before merkel `` invited '' all asylum seekers . 
  -- http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-germany-kosovo-migrants-iduskbn0lg21h20150212  the eu has seen a sharp rise in the number of kosovo citizens smuggling themselves into the bloc especially since a relaxation of travel rules allowing them to reach eu borders via serbia . 
  some 10,000 kosovars filed for asylum in hungary in just one month this year , many fleeing from poverty and unemployment . 
  that was more than half a year before merkel `` invited '' all asylum seekers . 
  -- http://budapestbeacon.com/public-policy/german-court-hungary-does-not-meet-minimum-eu-asylum-standards/10300  the german judiciary body granted the right to an iranian refugee coming from hungary to seek asylum in germany , based on the argument , that `` hungary does not meet minimum standards of asylum required by the eu '' . 
  that was more than a year before merkel `` invited '' all asylum seekers . 
  but of course , everything started 3 weeks ago . 
  link to the article ? 
  and which german newspaper ? 
  what fucking news outlet are you reading that you believe that 800,000 asylum seekers it the number germany can handle ? 
  that 's the number germany ** expects ** this year . 
   why did she do a 180 on her stance about this ? 
  she did n't . 
  well , she did n't want to , but it was interpreted as she did . 
  merkel said that the law does not allow to limit the number of refugees a country takes . 
  which is correct , but this was interpreted as `` everyone can come to germany '' . 
  and she said that germany will be able to manage the influx of refugees . 
  which was interpreted as `` really , everyone is welcome , we 'll be happy to have you '' . 
  and she said that dublin relocations for syrians are suspended . 
  which was interpreted as `` every person will receive asylum as long as they have a document that says syria '' . 
  the processing of asylum applications has n't changed at all . 
   speaking of , can somebody find what she said then and play it against what she is saying now ? 
  because seriously , it sounds like multiple personality disorder to me ... she said that asylum is reserved for people who are threatened by war and persecution , and that not everyone can stay in germany . 
  which has not changed since then . 
  that media and people have interpreted `` no dublin relocations for syrians '' as `` no deportations for syrians '' and `` the law does not allow a limit '' as `` germany will take every single person that wants to come to germany '' might be her problem , but it does n't sound like a multiple personality disorder . 
  united in `` not our problem '' . 
  the refugee crisis did n't start three weeks ago when merkel said something she should n't have said . 
  at that point germany was already expecting 800,000 asylum seekers this year . 
  where was the unity back then ? 
  where were the large joint aid efforts ? 
  where were the suggestions of the know-it-alls how to tackle the crisis ? 
  everyone was just saying `` that wo n't work '' and `` not our problem '' . 
  punishment should be sponsorship of the smuggled asylum applicant and their family in case family reunification is granted . 
  btw , according to german law , it 's only illegal if you receive something for it , or if you do it multiple times or bring multiple people . 
  2 , abs . 
  oh , my mistake . 
  in that case i do n't have the decision numbers , iran is not in the top 10 countries of origin . 
  according to the [ latest report ( german , page 4 ) ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201508-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) of the german immigration office , in august 2015 germany received 33,447 first asylum requests , 10,112 were from syrians . 
  i did the math , and that 's 30 %, 
   or maybe she could have been clear that she has no powers to suddenly `` suspend dublin ii '' for the eu countries , and that she is not doing that . 
  i mean , how the hell would she even `` suspend dublin ii '' for say finland ? 
  where the fuck did she get such powers anyway ? 
   and where the fuck did merkel say anything like that ? 
  in germany it 's pretty pointless . 
  the protection quota for syrians is basically 100 % . 
  in the first 8 months of 2015 , 41,532 asylum decisions were made for syrians , from those 7 were rejected . 
  [ german source , page 7 ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/201508-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  in germany the so called short path takes 6 years , is only open for people who have received asylum , and the person that wants to become a citizen has to be able to pass a language and integration course , must have a clean criminal record , must pledge to follow the constitution , must have a job and be able to support their family with their family income . 
  if asylum seekers are leeches on society who just want to get benefits , they wo n't get citizenship . 
  if asylum seekers refuse to integrate , they wo n't get citizenship . 
  sounds like a good deal . 
   she destroyed a lot of trust in the government and lost a huge amount of voters . 
  can you cite some numbers ? 
   merkel handled this crisis in the worst way possible . 
  she saw a dead kid washed ashore and decided to try to be a humanitarian without even putting a single thought about her own country . 
  you should check the timeline of these events . 
  we should immediately check all blonde middle easterners for their isis connections . 
  are there concrete plans to reduce bureaucracy ? 
  are there plans to release funds right now ? 
  or will they continue to turn sports halls into makeshift asylum homes ? 
  that 's the problem . 
  with a concrete plan and a couple billion euro that are made available immediately , this could probably be manageable . 
  but all the federal government says is no limits , we 'll do it and we need a eu solution . 
  meanwhile the states beg for help from the federal government . 
  and the districts beg for more help from the states .
