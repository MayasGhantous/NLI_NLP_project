  they would stop playing their threat cards immediately . 
  ( un ) fortunately nobody is willing to go down to this level of politics . 
  so they can continue to spew their bullshit without consequences . 
  prepare for more pointless threats in the coming months . 
  a trademark on the word europe or something . 
  maybe they should try a constructive plan instead of creating ruffles and threats ? 
  as long as the business plan of greece looks like this : - no more austerity - germany pays 200 phantastillion euro reparations - eu pays 50 phantastillion euro or we let isis into the union - eu/imf/us pays 100 phantastillion or we become a russian/chinese colony - eu pays 12 phantastillion because we are the birthplace of democracy - eu pays 20 phantastillion because europe is a greek word the entities , formerly know as institutions , will continue their austerity course . 
  these pointless arguments are just made so greeks feel good because they are so so important for the rest of the world . 
  everyone bullies greece , that 's why they ca n't get their shit together . 
  it 's always the other countries fault . 
  i guess that 's something they have in common with their russian brethren . 
  or maybe i 'm an idiot because i do n't understand how it plays a significant role in road safety . 
  we started with very basic english ( it was called begegnungssprache ) in the third year of elementary school . 
  i guess that means i was 8 years old . 
  as long as you do n't drive with one eye closed i do n't see how the dominant eye matters . 
  if they would have removed the color after a state was selected , i would probably be at 10 % . 
  i guessed 42 of them . 
  people that use the latin alphabet would be in advantage when learning esperanto . 
  we ca n't let this happen !, 
  we should pick one of the african khoisan languages . 
  those with the [ clicks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cce-bdgcw2a ) . 
  it 'll be incredible hard to learn for every european citizen , so this should be the language of choice . 
  completely neutral and completely useless . 
  replacing 2nd language english with esperanto will destroy our economy because we ca n't communicate with normal people outside of the esperanto union anymore . 
  but at least it 's fair and neutral . 
  i do n't want to be part of that eu anymore . 
  just do n't mention the first try , 
  57 % and i 'm not even american . 
   they could have come up with reparation claims decades ago . 
  they did . 
  the claim that germany has to pay back the war loan is not new . 
  it just gets very confusing because everyone , especially media , mix up actual war reparations with the repayment of a loan that was given bilaterally during war time . 
  greece actually has a valid point if the loan was bilateral agreed upon . 
  but if the loan was not taken by force the conditions are still in place . 
  which means 0 % interest . 
  which means the loan is worth around 13 billion euro . 
  and that 's the reason greece will continue to talk to the press about the hundreds of billions germany owes , instead of taking the case to an international court . 
  best case scenario they get 13 billion euro after a decade of court hearings . 
  worst case scenario they do n't get anything . 
  but in either case they will lose germanys support , immediately . 
   germany should just invest into greek economy . 
  so greece can seize all these assets in a year or two ? 
  germany should stop all greek investments ( there are actually a couple of greek-german projects ) until greece declares that ww2 is no longer a topic between the two countries . 
  greece agreed to wait until a peace-treaty . 
  there is no peace-treaty . 
  obviously greece had illiterate legal advisors because they did n't notice the `` instead of a peace treaty '' thing in the 2 +4 agreement . 
  germany has not signed any peace-treaty . 
  and that 's the part were the simple question turns into a 10 page essay . 
  that 's what you get for signing contracts without reading them . 
  namely the * un convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees * . 
  and most people that are allowed to stay do n't qualify for asylum . 
  but we are not third world countries . 
  in civilized countries you are free to do whatever the fuck you want unless you interfere with the rights of others . 
  i guess it 's time for a program that distributes asylum seekers according to economic power of the eu countries . 
  i am looking at france in particular . 
  second highest gdp in the union and less applications than countries like bulgaria , hungary , romania . 
  because not even asylum seekers want to live in poland ? 
  the numbers are about people that applied . 
  only a small amount of people actually qualify for asylum . 
  in germany it was around 1.1 % in 2013 . 
  according to [ eurostat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:number_of_\\ ( non-eu \\ ) _ asylum_applicants_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states , _ by_age_distribution , _ 2014 _ \\ ( \u00b9 \\ ) _ yb15_ii . png ) poland received 8020 applications in 2014, 
  so who would be png for europe ? 
  most of the countries bordering the mediterranean sea either create refugees because there are civil unrests or a full blown civil war going on . 
  or they already attract tons of refugees . 
  we usually support the anti-government movements in these countries . 
  because the governments are defacto dictatorships that do n't care about human rights . 
  eurostat has some statistics http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics you are probably looking for that one : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a4/countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2013_and_2014_yb15_ii.png, 
  unfortunately letting them drown is the only way to stop this problem . 
  once they set foot on your soil they have the right to request asylum . 
  because they board their boats in unsafe countries you ca n't send them back there to request asylum . 
  if they tell that they come from one of the dozen unsafe countries in africa/arabia and lost their papers , you have to prove that they are residents of a safe country . 
  which is next to impossible . 
  running checks and registrations sounds nice . 
  check them for 15 minutes and send them back with the next boat . 
  but that 's not how that works . 
  the process takes months and you ca n't send them back unless you are very very certain that they are not in danger in their home country . 
  everything else is a violation of the un convention that every country in europe signed . 
  while it seems logical it 's also against the * un convention regarding the status of refugees * , if the country you return them to is not safe . 
  why would any stable and safe nation take that deal ? 
  that would be more than stupid . 
  the only way to make this work is to turn the countries where they board their boats into stable and safe countries . 
  you could then send them back to these countries and tell them to seek asylum there . 
  but as long as these countries are not safe , the un convention relating to the status of refugees prohibits forcible returns . 
  uberpop is n't the only product uber offers . 
  any source that facebook is controlled/banned in russia ? 
  i have never heard about that . 
   if the commission wants to foster startup innovation , they need to get serious about supporting competition and developing a single market for everything . 
  hehe . 
  we ca n't even abolish roaming fees . 
  - turn the eu into a true union . 
  we need a true single market . 
  for example we have to create a single eu copyright collection agency . 
  the eu offers no advantage if i have to deal with at least 28 agencies . 
  we even have to force defacto multi national companies like sony to act as * sony eu * instead of 28 independent sony 's . 
  we need harmonized laws , as in `` the law is the same everywhere '' . 
  not the eu minimum law that can be amended by the countries . 
  if a business wants to cater to 500 million eu citizens , it has to follow 28 different laws . 
  and these are things that will never change because the 28 different eu countries want to make their own laws . 
  i do n't judge them , but 28 different markets can not win against the single market usa . 
  even if you call the 28 markets a union .
