  so the us stays the most important market for startups in the european union . 
  and if your main market is the us , being in the eu does n't offer any advantages . 
  quite the opposite actually . 
  if a us company violates eu law it 's hard to get hold of them , if a eu company violates eu law you can easily sue them in their home country . 
  according to [ uscourts.gov ] ( http://www.uscourts.gov/federalcourts/bankruptcy/bankruptcybasics/chapter9.aspx ) chapter 9 provides for reorganization of municipalities . 
  am i looking at the wrong place or did you mix up numbers ? 
  sounds like he is comparing a bank loan to venture capital . 
  which is a pretty stupid comparison . 
  of course you are personally responsible for a bank loan if you tell the bank that you want to be personally responsible . 
  that 's usually what happens if startups want bank loans , the banks do n't trust the business so they want a liability guarantee from the founders/partners of the business . 
  eu countries have plenty of limited liability business types . 
  and since we have freedom of movement you can basically choose a business type from the whole union . 
  so if your country does n't offer something that you want just pick one from a different country . 
   though a lot of promising companies get gobbled up by big us ones . 
  it would be very difficult for the next google , facebook or microsoft to appear when those companies basically have several levels of magnitude more funds than any would be competitor . 
  that 's the problem with start-ups . 
  almost all of them are created to be sold as fast as possible . 
  we need it businesses that want to stick around for decades . 
  you ca n't claim asylum because you do n't like taxes . 
   but if you are a eu citizen you do n't have to anyway . 
  you can just pick a nice place in the eu and move there . 
  you ca n't leave the implant at home . 
  so why do n't the us leave ? 
  schengen 2.0 it comes with walls , barbed wire , spring guns and a shooting order . 
  act now !, 
  before it 's too late !, 
  isis ( and the ruskys ) will take our jobs and our women !, 
  because it 's not october 29th . 
  i always liked the idea of paying politicians extremely well and giving them a nice pension once they are no longer active politicians . 
  and at the same time we prohibit all the monetary advantages they gain from their position , i.e. 
  consultant jobs , board memberships and paid speeches , for their term plus 10 years . 
  and while we 're there we would punish any advantages that were taken by politicians . 
  i am talking jail time for people like former chancellor of germany gerhard ` gazprom ' schr\u00f6der . 
  i guess we would be able to pay the increased salary cost from the money we save because politicians would n't act with their own interests so high on their priority list . 
  i say we should cut their salaries down to the national minimum salary . 
  we have to make sure that our politicians are receptive to bribery , so it 's better to pay them badly . 
  if we reduce the salary of the 2 eu presidents to zero we could send each greek 6 cents . 
  that will change everything . 
   the farming games on fb make enough money to support the website because facebook uses userdata and tracking to place these ads . 
  that 's what people call spying . 
  if you can only show random ads ( because no spying , no tracking ) ads do n't get you much money . 
  because it 's a security risk . 
  if you are in possession of the remote control you can control literally hundreds of aircrafts . 
  there are always vulnerabilities in encryption protocols . 
  it 's one thing when a vulnerability leads to a massive leak of private data like passwords , it would be much worse if you can crash hundreds of planes with a finger tip . 
  and of course you could get access to the legitimate remote control as well . 
  forceful enter the facility , or plant one of your sleepers in the team that is responsible . 
  besides fully automated planes there is no way to protect a plane from the pilot . 
  if he ca n't lock the door he knocks out the other pilot during final approach and flies his plane into the fuel storage tanks at the airport . 
  politicians always want to do a lot . 
  talk is cheap . 
  and wanting things is even cheaper . 
  but hey , if we just bend the rules so apple , facebook , google and microsoft ca n't offer their services in europe we will win . 
  that 's how innovation is seen in europe . 
  let 's outlaw whatsapp , so europeans have to use shit like joyn . 
  depends what they consider a major check ... a-check , every 125 flight hours , takes 20-50 man-hours and is done overnight . 
  b-check , every 4-6 months , takes 150 man-hours and 1-3 days . 
  c-check , every 20-24 months . 
  a majority of the components are inspected , takes 6,000 man-hours and 1-2 weeks . 
  d-check , every 6 years . 
  complete overhaul , the whole plane is taken apart . 
  takes 50,000 man hours and up to 2 months . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aircraft_maintenance_checks here is a [ time lapse of a a319 c-check ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxv4ypmnasg ), 
  wait until you hear about the 1.2 million deaths that are caused by road traffic accidents every year . 
   the eastern expansion was probably a mistake . 
  just 50 years too early . 
  eastern europe should have joined efta instead . 
  free trade with the eu , without all that solidarity and human rights bullshit of leftists cyclists . 
  thought crimes are not prosecuted in germany . 
  in germany you can believe whatever you want . 
  you should just be careful what you say in public . 
  there 's more to impersonating than wearing a vest that says `` something something police '' . 
  are there actual german police officers who have police written on their uniform ? 
  i have a t-shirt that says `` bier polizei '' . 
  should i be charged with a crime ? 
  no problem with that . 
  but as long as that 's the case one should be careful with those double fuck offs . 
  thank god that greece has and always had impenetrable borders . 
  otherwise all these kurds would have come to the eu already . 
  lol, 
  yet you ca n't police your own airspace and rely on leeches like germany to do that job . 
  [ you 're welcome ] ( http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/poc/luftwaffe?uri=ci%3abw.lw.x.mediabild&amp;de.conet.contentintegrator.portlet.current.id=3135382e33322e3135332e36313030303030303069676e62726876632020202020 ) . 
  and from the other side , google germany :  warum ist australien keine insel ? 
   why is australia not an island ? 
  because someone wrote a highly upvoted post in the [ afd thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4h3t6t/germany_adf_meeting_clashes_before_farright/d2n9fwc ) that right-wingers have family and jobs and so have neither time nor will to blocade `` far-left '' events . 
   the so called `` far-righters '' of today are in fact conservatives . 
  most of them have jobs and family and no time or will to blocade `` far-left '' events . 
  i 'm not talking on npd or neo-nazi groups ( the real far-righters ) , i 'm especially talking about afd , pegida and releated groups . 
  -- and if you actually believe that this demonstration has nothing to do with pegida or the afd you should visit the facebook page of `` zwickau wehrt sich '' . 
  https://www.facebook.com/zwickauwehrtsich/ disclaimer : i live right next to zwickau . 
  the actual definition is a bit more complicated . 
  drugging someone is covered by the law . 
   20 years would also need to be a really brutal rape just short of killing basicly . 
  not short of . 
  20 years is only possible if the victims dies . 
  not coincidentally `` 10 to 20 years or prison for life '' is also the sentence for murder . 
  i was thinking about [ eurocity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/eurocity_network_2010_winter.svg ), 
  - does `` sexual intercourse without consent '' require penetration ? 
  ( like in the uk ) - does `` sexual intercourse without consent '' require physically resistance from the victim ? 
  ( like in germany ) that 's where the difficulties come from .
