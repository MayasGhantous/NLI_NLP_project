  in this case the difference between `` pretty rare '' and the most common relationship is 5 percentage points . 
  i 've read in the afd thread that they are too busy working and they do n't have time for shit like that . 
  i bet 100 $ on `` different definition of rape '' . 
  according to the [ official statistics ] ( http://www.justice.gouv.fr/art_pix/1_stat_livret_final_hd.pdf ) from france , there were 1,188 rapes in 2013 . 
   rape by unknown assailant are pretty rare to quantify `` pretty rare '' : in germany in 2014 , 33.8 % of all cases against sexual self-determination were committed by people who had no ( known ) relationship to the victim .

  how tollerant and progressive of them [ !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4h3t6t/germany_adf_meeting_clashes_before_farright/d2n5vgz ), 
  according to the un refugee convention , refugees have the right to work in their host country . 
  the map shows high speed rail connections only . 
  if you do n't insist on traveling via [ intercity-express ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intercity-express ) there are plenty more . 
  now kiss . 
   of course there is more homosexual but they are more divorced too . 
  for example frauke petry , leader of the afd . 
   the stay at home mother is an example too of some kind of backwardness for example frauke petry , leader of the afd . 
  it 's very ironic actually . 
  do n't forget austria  but in the last years that restriction merely existed on paper and almost everyone who requested a work permit in germany got one . 
  number of poles who moved to germany : - 2004 : 9,495 - 2005 : 9,364 - 2006 : 10,802 - 2007 : 14,995 - 2008 : 47,880 - 2009 : 189,166 - 2010 : 155,131 - 2011 : 157,059 - 2012 : 217,546 - 2013 : 220,311 the number of migrants from the czech republic peaked years before the restrictions were lifted . 
  2007 : 104,445 , 2008 : 108,267 , 2012 : 34,337 for hungary , germany apparently just rubber stamped every request for work permit . 
  - 2000 : 21,726 - 2001 : 22,079 - 2002 : 19,855 - 2003 : 21,327 - 2004 : 24,298 hungary joins eu - 2005 : 27,820 - 2006 : 25,732 - 2007 : 24,361 - 2008 : 37,652 - 2009 : 27,894 - 2010 : 25,519 - 2011 : 28,018 free movement restrictions lifted - 2012 : 33,702 - 2013 : 38,968 i guess we would have gotten all these workers without their home countries joining the eu . 
  in my whole life i have never seen germans like this . 
  which is probably the point . 
  but maybe we are all not comfortable being german , and this depiction is not something from the past . 
   they specifically made it part of their program to undo the nuclear exit the spd and greens pushed . 
  with regards to the lifespan of existing power plants . 
  they did n't undo all the changes spd and greens introduced in 2002 . 
  the construction of new nuclear reactors was still not allowed after the cdu undid the nuclear exit that was agreed in the parliament in 2002 . 
  people like to pretend that the cdu was very pro-nuclear and anti-renewables and merkel ( like dictators do ) betrayed the party and singlehandedly stopped the bright nuclear future of germany and turned it into a green leftist hell of windmills . 
  but they were n't and merkel did n't . 
  nuclear energy never had a future in germany , even without fukushima , or without the `` hilariously terrible arguments '' . 
  --  for now nuclear energy is an indispensable part in a balanced energy mix . 
  we understand the contribution of nuclear energy to our power supply as a bridging technology , because today climate-friendly and cost-effective alternative are not available in sufficient manner . 
  therefore we strive for a lifetime extension of secure german plants . 
  we reject the construction of new nuclear power plants . 
  the majority of the additional profits from the lifetime extension of nuclear power plants should be used , after a binding agreement with energy businesses , to research in the areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources , and to lower energy prices . 
  that would be lying . 
  that photo misses her 4 children and her ex-husband . 
  indeed . 
  so easy . 
  i wonder why nobody has tried that yet . 
  that trade union exists since 1960 . 
  it 's called efta . 
  you should teach france how to run nuclear plants forever . 
  they have shut down a couple reactors already , and they will continue to shut down more reactors in the future . 
  because nuclear plants can run forever ? 
  and then you realize who pays for our social systems . 
   which means we will have a future government who will revert these decisions sometimes in the late 2020s . 
  keep dreaming . 
   especially weird if considering the fact that the cdu was in favor of nuclear energy before , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  they were in favor of nuclear energy as a bridge technology until renewables are reliable ( quoted from the coalition program 2009 ) . 
  the cdu did not want to build new nuclear power plants , so they did n't get rid of the prohibition to built new plants . 
  they only changed the laws to prolong the runtimes of existing nuclear power plants . 
  and the prolongation was coupled to funding , improving and promoting renewables . 
  the goals that are currently in place ( e.g. 
  80 % renewables in electric energy consumption by 2050 ) were also set before fukushima . 
  so no , merkel did n't drop everything the party stood for . 
  by 2050 80 % of the electric energy consumed in germany should come from renewables . 
  and by then we want to use only half of the primary energy we used in 2008 . 
  these are the official targets of the government . 
  and they were set before fukushima . 
   there was n't much response to russian forces crossing the estonian border and kidnapping a border official . 
    it was essentially an attack . 
  has estonia called for consultations according to nato article 4 ? 
  has estonia called for eu security consultations ? 
  so estonia probably believed it was an estonian issue that does n't concern its allies . 
  alternative durch freude, 
  did they shoot at it 55 times just to tickle it ? 
  you probably misunderstood me . 
  we like to pretend that we are pacifist and neutral . 
  we also love to trade with russia , so we ( collectively ) pretend that they are not that bad . 
  we also believe in diplomacy , so further provocation is not the best idea . 
  but once the first russian tank rolls over an eu border that 's gone . 
  the 31 % germans that would send troops to defend the baltics today will turn into 70 + % easily . 
  similar to how it happened with afghanistan . 
  there was and still is a lot of support for the german contribution to isaf/rs . 
  much more than anyone would have imagined before 9/11 . 
  it 's just very easy to say that you are against military interventions during peace time . 
   the german government should make the employment of an illegal alien extremely expensive and detrimental to the business . 
  is a fine up to 500,000 $ not expensive enough ? 
  if you employ more than 5 or are caught repeatedly you might also end imprisoned . 
  yep . 
  the refugee crisis was literally started in late august 2015 . 
  not a single asylum seeker has entered europe before that . 
   probably also because most eastern eu people have a rather high self-esteem and thus would find it pretty `` derogatory '' to have to go to say germany and then have to compete for crappy jobs with refugees from third world countries and then live in these bad areas as well . 
  just two more weeks and the new report that monitors migration of eu citizens to germany will be released . 
  it 'll prove you wrong . 
  literally tens of millions of voters who ca n't vote because they are not german citizens . 
  d'uh . 
  before the conflict . 
  you would have gotten even lower numbers when you would have asked `` are you willing to send german troops to afghanistan if the us were attacked '' on 10 . 
  september 2001 . 
  few weeks later the opinions were split equally with a small majority in favor of a military deployment . 
   estonian robo-commissioner andrus ansip works in one of this favourite suggestions : using national id cards to log in to online services : `` online platforms need to accept credentials issued or recognised by national public authorities , such as electronic id cards , citizen cards , bank cards or mobile ids '' . 
    why ? 
  apparently , `` for every consumer to have a multitude of username and password combinations is not only inconvenient but becomes a security risk . '' so the headline should be `` one eu commissioner wants you be able to log into youtube using your state-issued id card ( and if you do n't like that just use your email account ) '' but well . 
  uk media . 
  i know a boss who loved to say `` if you do n't like it , leave . 
  there are hundreds waiting to do your job '' to his employees . 
  he stopped doing that a couple of years ago . 
  nowadays it 's `` if you know someone who is looking for work tell them to apply '' .
