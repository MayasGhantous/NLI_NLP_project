    regulation ( eu ) no 1289/2013 of the european parliament and of the council of 11 december 2013 established a revised reciprocity mechanism . 
  within six months of the date of publication of a member state 's notification of non-reciprocity and then at regular intervals of up to six months , the commission has to either adopt an implementing act on the temporary suspension for up to six months of the visa waiver for certain categories of citizens of the third country concerned , or submit a report assessing the situation and stating the reasons why it decided not to suspend the exemption from the visa requirement . 
  ** if the third country has not lifted the visa requirement within 24 months of the publication date , the commission is obliged by the regulation to adopt a delegated act on the temporary suspension of the visa waiver for 12 months for citizens of that third country . 
  **   ** on 12 april 2014 the commission published the notifications of non-reciprocity situations it had received from five member states : bulgaria , croatia , cyprus , poland and romania . 
  these notifications related to five third countries : australia , brunei darussalam , canada , japan and the united states of america ( us ) .

  that 's why you now read news about it . 
  yep . 
  it 's a conspiracy . 
  we made them buy the port for us because we do n't want the \\ #thisisacoup to be too obvious . 
   swedes : die on earth more like `` on soil '' or `` on the ground '' the translations are not that good . 
  and once again we are blamed for things that the austrians did . 
  that thing is the `` v\u00f6lkertafel '' , which was created in the early 18th century in styria . 
  a wild pole appears !, 
  -- the original even states `` even wilder '' . 
  can you be more specific ? 
  which eu decision needed unanimous approval ? 
  and whose veto was ignored ? 
  0.6 % of the people who live in the eu have voted no in that referendum . 
  considering that the brits and the dutch are usually among the most vocal who are against `` united states of europe '' and for more sovereignty of eu members , they seem pretty pissed that the dutch ca n't decide the relationship eu members have with the ukraine . 
  the eu is not the united states of europe . 
  the eu is a union of member states who have plenty of sovereignty . 
  the french do n't set the eu policy in regards of prostitution . 
  the germans do n't set the nuclear energy policy of the eu . 
  the hungarians do n't set the encryption policy . 
  and the dutch do n't set the foreign policy of the eu . 
  because all of these things are responsibilities of the individual members . 
   because that 's been the pattern before right ? 
  when did the eu ignore a veto of a member state ? 
  can you provide a few examples ? 
   thats the downside of the eu , things require unanimous approval , this is why the eu is still dealing with the greek issue . 
  some things need unanimous approval . 
  other 's do n't . 
  and many things are n't decided on the eu level at all . 
  denmark ca n't sign things that are decided on eu level . 
  but there 's literally hundred of other things that denmark can decide . 
   because thats how the eu system works ? 
  it 's either all or none . 
  no that 's not how the eu works . 
  we are not the united states of europe . 
  member states still have a lot of sovereignty . 
  so in the eu only the netherlands are a decent country ? 
   well , actually they do . 
  you cant just ignore the process thats set up for these treaties just because its inconvenient . 
  nobody is doing that . 
  if the netherlands veto something on the eu level that needs unanimous approval it wo n't pass and it wo n't be implemented . 
  but i do n't see why the dutch referendum should influence german foreign policy . 
  and i do n't see why the dutch should be able to block eu things that do n't need unanimous approval . 
  if you believe esta is similar to a visa you have never applied for a real visa . 
  no protective sign , no protection . 
  if you do n't want your ambulance shelled , put the red cross , red crescent , red lion with sun or the red crystal on them . 
  but keep in mind that it then will be illegal to transport regular soldiers and weapons with them . 
  is n't there plenty of `` opinion based '' violence in the us ? 
  i 'm pretty sure extremist groups do n't care if you confront and challenge them . 
   change the rules at halftime when was the last time this happened ? 
  did you just complain that the netherlands ca n't set the policy of the whole eu because germany already sets the policy of the whole eu ? 
  the eu does not sign its own treaties . 
  member states do . 
  blame your own government for ignoring votes on treaties . 
  these are two different things . 
  both the uk and the netherlands can do whatever they want . 
  but the uk ca n't have a referendum about germany leaving the eu . 
  and the netherlands ca n't have a referendum about the relationship between germany and ukraine . 
  -- hollande was thankfully very specific about this too . 
   `` as far as europe is concerned , ** it will implement what it can ** of the association ( agreement ) , '' hollande told a news conference after a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in metz eastern france . 
  the eu will implement what it can . 
  if the eu finds a majority for the individual items , they will implement what the netherlands ca n't or wo n't veto . 
   `` as far as france and germany , we will continue to support ukraine and apply the association agreement in our respective countries , '' he added . 
  but in areas that are n't set by the eu , france and germany will do as they please . 
  because the dutch do n't decide the policies of france and germany . 
  two examples : germany wo n't create a trade agreement with the ukraine because that 's a eu matter . 
  but germany might create a student exchange program , because that 's a national policy . 
  the 3.3 million ( for simplicity i just used the whole population of the netherlands as a calculation base ) people that voted against the ukraine proposal ca n't decide for the 491 million eu citizens that are n't dutch . 
  people who are willing to pay more for quality food want to have quality that you ca n't achieve by adding 10 % to your price . 
  at least in the frozen food sector we have high quality food in germany . 
  it 's made by frosta . 
  that 's as close as you get to healthy convenience food . 
  500g paella from frosta will cost you something like 3.29 $ . 
  750g paella from the kaufland brand is priced at 1.59 $ . 
  the expensive product is more than 3 times the price of the cheap one . 
  oh look , eu members that are n't the netherlands ignoring a vote in the netherlands . 
  schmidt - derivation from schmied which means smith 3 . 
  fischer - fisher 5 .

  becker - from b\u00e4cker , which means baker 9 . 
  schulz - from schulthei\u00df , someting like a mayor 10 . 
  hoffmann - a steward who manages farm 11 . 
  koch - cook 13 . 
  bauer - farmer 14 . 
  richter - judge , also mayor 15 . 
  klein - small w\u00f6rk dominates our surnames too . 
  to clarify : that order , if there was one ( the interior ministry denies that ) , was given on new year 's eve . 
  so if you have a trade deficit with germany you have to do austerity ? 
  these 250 billion euro are not laying around on a government bank account . 
  italy on the whole achieved a trade surplus of 45.2 billion euro in 2015 . 
  third in the eu after germany ( 251.9 billion ) and the netherlands ( 55.4 billion ) source : [ statista ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/252105/umfrage/handelsbilanz-der-eu-laender/ ), 
   so they are effectively acknowledging that crimea is russian now ? 
  that has been acknowledged since basically forever .
