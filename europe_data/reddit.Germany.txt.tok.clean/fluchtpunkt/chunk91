  exactly . 
  only two things can lead to a level 7 nuclear accident . 
  and . 
  ( as of 5 . 
  april 2016 ), 
   just read how the author mixes migrants and refugees and saying how for every returned syrian they will relocate one from turkey . 
  this does n't even make sense and the guy has no idea what he is talking about . 
  it might not make sense for totally unbiased people like you , but that is literally what was agreed upon !!!!!!!!!, 
   the agreement finalises the one-for-one principle that eu leaders and turkey provisionally agreed on 7 march : ** all new irregular migrants crossing from turkey into greek islands will be returned to turkey ; and for every syrian returned to turkey from greek islands , another syrian will be resettled from turkey to the eu . 
  ** this temporary link between resettlement and return is feasible up to a limit of 72,000 using the eu 's existing resettlement and relocation commitments , under which respectively 18,000 and 54,000 places remain available .

   for every deported person , turkey can send a syrian war refugee to europe . 
  that 's not true . 
  the refugee exchange is only done for syrians . 
  so each syrian that will be deported to turkey will be replaced with a syrian from a turkish refugee camp . 
  initially that scheme is limited to 72,000 people . 
  other nationalities that will be deported back to turkey wo n't be replaced by anyone . 
   under these circumstances , what motivates turkey to even hold back persons from going to greece ? 
  nothing . 
  as long as turkey takes everyone back , that 's not even necessary . 
  the asylum seekers will stop coming to greece once they realize that every single one of them will be deported . 
  i doubt that there are many syrians who pay a couple thousand euro to get to greece just so another syrian can be relocated from turkey to the eu . 
  this is correct , the refugee exchange only applies to syrians .

   to be fair , the imf is also the only other significant player actually calling for serious debt relief to be given to greece . 
    wrap your head around that for a moment in relation to the above . 
  and guess which part of the debt the imf does n't want to be touched . 
  that 's right , the part that greece owes the imf . 
  that 's why they can call for debt relief . 
  it 's not their money . 
   lithuania ai n't exactly a welfare state , you have two options here : you either work or work hard . 
  or you move to western europe . 
   assume just 1 % of that 30 % are committed to jihad . 
  so 13 in total . 
  nine from the november paris attacks are dead . 
  two from the recent attacks in brussels are dead too . 
  one suspect was killed during the march 2016 police raids in brussels . 
  and abdeslam is in custody . 
  sounds like we 're safe now . 
   matter of fact with the consent of the parents an adult can have sex with a 12 and 13 year old in germany . 
  stgb \u00a7 176 disagrees with you  section 176  child abuse   ( 1 ) whosoever engages in sexual activity with a person under fourteen years of age ( child ) or allows the child to engage in sexual activity with himself shall be liable to imprisonment from six months to ten years . 
  i wonder if germany will `` use diplomatic channels to raise awareness and ask our ~ ~ german ~ ~ polish partners who this serves '' . 
  like poland did when kaczynski [ was ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/poland-outraged-at-german-carnival-float-criticizing-party-leader/a-19036800 ) part of a carnival float . 
   `` he loves to fuck goats '' [ ... ] `` he watches child porn '' [ ... ] `` he has fellatio with 100 sheep '' [ ... ] `` he is the star of every gang bang party '' . 
  how exactly does this qualify as satire ? 
  does france mine its own nuclear fuel ? 
  you are wrong . 
  here 's what the german criminal code says :  section 176  child abuse   ( 1 ) ** whosoever engages in sexual activity with a person under fourteen years of age ( child ) ** or allows the child to engage in sexual activity with himself ** shall be liable to imprisonment ** from six months to ten years . 
  --  section 182  abuse of juveniles   ( 1 ) ** whosoever abuses a person under eighteen years of age by taking advantage of an exploitative situation ** by   1 \\ . 
  engaging in sexual activity with the person or suffering the person to engage actively in sexual activity with him or   2 \\ . 
  inducing the person to engage in sexual activity with a third person or to suffer sexual acts committed on their own body by a third person ,   ** shall be liable to imprisonment ** not exceeding five years . 
    ( 2 ) ** the same penalty shall apply to a person over eighteen years of age who abuses a person under eighteen years of age by engaging in sexual activity ** with him or to by inducing the person to suffer sexual acts committed by him on their own body ** for a financial reward . 
  **   ( 3 ) ** a person over twenty-one years of age who abuses a person under sixteen years of age ** by   1 \\ . 
  engaging in sexual activity with the person or causing the person to engage actively in sexual activity with him or   2 \\ . 
  inducing the person to engage in sexual activity with a third person or to suffer sexual acts committed on their own body by a third person ,   ** and thereby exploits the victims lack of capacity for sexual self-determination shall be liable to imprisonment ** not exceeding three years or a fine . 
    ( 4 ) the attempt shall be punishable . 
    ( 5 ) in cases under subsection ( 3 ) above the offence may only be prosecuted upon request unless the prosecuting authority considers propio motu that prosecution is required out of special public interest . 
    ( 6 ) in cases under subsections ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) above the court may order a discharge under these provisions if in consideration of the conduct of the person against whom the offence was committed the harm of the offence is of a minor nature . 
  -- do n't pay them , do n't take advantages of an exploitative situation , and do n't exploit their lack of sexual self-determination and you are good to go . 
  there are more limitations if the other person has a position of trust , for example because they are teacher or a superior . 
  apparently you believe a 14 year old is mature enough to consent to having sex . 
  why does it matter from what country or culture their partner is ? 
  wrong . 
  for each ** syrian ** that is returned to turkey , the eu resettles one syrian from turkish refugee camps . 
  this does not apply to any other nationality . 
  here 's the list of nationalities that currently have visa free access to the schengen zone : - albania - andorra - antigua and barbuda - argentina - australia - bahamas - barbados - bosnia and herzegovina - brazil - brunei - canada - chile - colombia - costa rica - dominica - el salvador - grenada - guatemala - honduras - hong kong - israel - japan - macau - macedonia - malaysia - mauritius - mexico - moldova - monaco - montenegro - new zealand - nicaragua - palau - panama - paraguay - peru - saint kitts and nevis - saint lucia - saint vincent and the grenadines - samoa - san marino - serbia - seychelles - singapore - south korea - taiwan - timor-leste - tonga - trinidad and tobago - united arab emirates - united states - uruguay - vanuatu - vatican city - venezuela - british nationals who are not nationals of the united kingdom for the purposes of european union law, 
  well said . 
  only indigenous europeans should be allowed to fuck our schoolgirls . 
   out of the top 100 exporters in romania , not even one is romanian-owned . 
  all of them are foreign-owned , most of them western european . 
  and without these companies you would n't export anything . 
  probably brussels fault . 
  on \\ / r/europe of course . 
  english article : http://www.dw.com/en/former-german-foreign-minister-hans-dietrich-genscher-dies-aged-89/a-19147751, 
  that 's where the `` non clonezoned.link '' part starts . 
  the part about belgium was edited in . 
  here 's the original trump article : http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/donald-trump-abortion-remarks-biggest-campaign-crisis, 
  lies !, 
  according to the eu turkey is safe third country . 
  i hope that 's net migration . 
  otherwise the constant complaining would be ridiculous . 
  highway projects go to the company that delivers the best bid . 
  there are also other eu institutions that contribute development aid . 
  as a whole we 're still far away from the 0.7 % target though . 
   in 2013 , the eu spent $ 56.2 bn on development aid -- aid from eu funds combined with aid from eu countries ' national budgets . 
   that amounts to 0.43 % of eu gross national income ( gni ) . 
  eu countries have committed themselves to reaching the target of 0.7 % of gni by 2015 . 
  the `` i never said that '' part . 
  not only the headline is clickbait , the whole article is . 
  forcing people to have children they do n't want will be totally awesome . 
  fuck those kids , it 's good for the demography . 
  who would have thought that you can get fired if you damage the reputation of your employer . 
  but thanks for bringing this 15 year old news article to our attention . 
  yes . 
  that photo is the reason why we have the term `` streisand effect '' . 
  a project took 12,000 photos of coastlines in california to document erosion and influence policy makers . 
  one of these photos showed streisand 's mansion . 
  she sued the project to remove the photo .
