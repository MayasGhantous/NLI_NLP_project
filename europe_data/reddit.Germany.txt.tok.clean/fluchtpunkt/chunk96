  i believe the relationship with poland is mostly business oriented . 
  there were a couple events where businesses have met . 
  and some of the local companies have a booth together at their local job fair . 
  countries that do n't have the capabilities to deliver bomb loads are obviously excused . 
  i 'm not so sure about the rest of the eu though . 
  pledging solidarity with france was the easy part . 
  delivering on that pledge was the hard part . 
  and many members have failed . 
  unfortunately cowardly is the only thing that comes to my mind when i think about the german `` we do n't bomb them , but we help you find them so you can bomb them '' foreign policy regarding isis . 
  i am saying `` they have a foreign policy that does n't reek of cowardice '' . 
  i was joking . 
  it 's of course a new poll . 
  [ with ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/media-centre/polls/eu-referendum-tracker-22 ) 41 % leave and 43 % stay . 
  and [ last week ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/media-centre/polls/eu-referendum-tracker-21 ) the poll showed 41 % leave and 40 % remain . 
  and the poll the [ week before ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/media-centre/polls/eu-referendum-tracker-20 ) showed both leave and remain at 41 % . 
  and the poll the [ week before that one ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/media-centre/polls/eu-referendum-tracker-19 ) showed 40 % leave to 42 % remain . 
  and one [ week earlier ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/media-centre/polls/eu-referendum-tracker-18 ) the results were 39 % leave and 43 % remain . 
  and so on . 
  [ this icm poll ] ( http://www.icmunlimited.com/media-centre/polls/eu-referendum-tracker-22 ) ? 
   the proportion of leave supporters holds steady in icm 's eu tracker this week , with ** 41 % of the public in favour of a brexit ** . 
  but there 's a significant dip in the proportion of undecided voters since the previous poll - down to 16 % from 19 % , the lowest point in our tracker since early november - while ** support for remain in has increased to 43 % ** . 
  how are they different ? 
  frontex does n't have border officers . 
  they are just an agency to improve communication and cooperation between national border agencies . 
  it 's an old german tradition . 
   i decide who is a jew !, 
   f\u00fchrer and reich chancellor can grant exemptions from the provisions of the implementations regulations . 
  belgium is one of the 5 eu countries that has actually dropped bombs on isis . 
  well . 
  the eu has n't signed the non-proliferation treaty . 
  maybe . 
  more law enforcement cooperation is urgently needed . 
  but there 's no need for a eu-dhs as long as we do n't have eu-fbi and eu-cbp . 
  i think we should work to improve what we already have . 
  we need to turn europol from an agency that coordinates between national police into a police agency that actually has law enforcement officers with actual law enforcement capabilities in every member state . 
  europol without leo is as useful as frontex without border guards . 
  and we already see how useful frontex is . 
  great source for statistics , but not useful in everything that actually matters . 
  deleted for `` has been posted countless times before with slightly different numbers '' . 
  is that the plot of * the purge 3 * ? 
  every crime is legal and police is unavailable until the terrorists who blow up airports and shoot at clubs are arrested . 
  complaining on the internet about people who show compassion . 
  what a tough guy you are . 
  tell us the tough guy reaction . 
  what are you doing ? 
  were countries surrounded by fences during these times ? 
  if you suspect people of terrorism you can raid them without a state of emergency . 
  just have to ask a judge for permission . 
  and if there 's danger in delay you do n't even need that . 
  just need something to justify afterwards . 
  france did at least 3200 raids and the counterterrorism unit of the paris prosecutor 's office has opened five terrorism-related investigations . 
  ^ ^ [ source ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/france-state-emergency-extended-slim-evidence-160217174759408.html ) five investigations ( and very likely 0 convictions in the future ) from 3200 raids is far from enough to justify a permanent state of emergency . 
  voting right-wing parties to keep the asylum seekers out . 
  obviously . 
  turkey . 
  nah , just kidding . 
  they will never make it into the header . 
  websites create click-bait content about it to sell more ads terror attacks in brussels . 
  you wo n't believe what happened next !, 
  i would bet my citizenship that the terrorists that attacked belgium were home grown too . 
  and adding scare quotes around their nationality does n't change that . 
  the terrorists are already among us . 
  and they have been here for a very long time . 
  we also declare a state of emergency from time to time . 
  so merkel is also responsible for radical muslims that have been living in the eu for years if not decades ? 
  she must be a wizard or something . 
  they are freedom fries . 
   eu offers of expedited process for visa-free access seem to me to be particularly hard to offer in this particular context , and also hard to measure effort in eu progress here . 
  i think that part of the deal can actually be measured pretty easy . 
  the eu gave turkey a list of seventy-something concrete things that have to be fulfilled until the end of april . 
  and the eu will then check the status of the implementation until the end of june . 
  if turkey manages to fulfill that list it 'll be hard for the eu to not grant them visa-free access . 
  the 1-1 exchange is about syrians . 
  syrians who enter greece irregularly will be deported and replaced by syrians from turkish refugee camps . 
  non-syrians who are deported back to turkey wo n't be replaced by people from refugee camps . 
  but apparently the `` we should help real refugees and not the people who are wealthy enough to pay smugglers '' crowd has already switched to `` not our problem '' . 
  that 's the fun thing about relative contributions . 
  if poland , the czech republic , romania , hungary , slovakia , croatia , bulgaria , slovenia , lithuania , latvia and estonia would each spend 2 % . 
  germany could outspend all of them with just spending 0.75 % of gdp . 
  germany spends around double of that . 
  and only estonia and poland spend the 2 % . 
  unfortunately for estonia , they are so small that they ca n't police their own airspace with that 2 % spending . 
   hungarians , in 1848 it was written in the book of fate that nothing could be done against the habsburg empire . 
  if we had then resigned ourselves to that outcome , our fate would have been sealed , and the german sea would have swallowed up the hungarians . 
    in 1956 it was written in the book of fate that we were to remain an occupied and sovietised country , until patriotism was extinguished in the very last hungarian . 
    if then we had resigned ourselves to that outcome , our fate would have been sealed , and the soviet sea would have swallowed up the hungarians . 
    today it is written in the book of fate that hidden , faceless world powers will eliminate everything that is unique , autonomous , age-old and national . 
    they will blend cultures , religions and populations , until our many-faceted and proud europe will finally become bloodless and docile . 
    and if we resign ourselves to this outcome , our fate will be sealed , and we will be swallowed up in the enormous belly of the united states of europe . 
    the task which awaits the hungarian people , the nations of central europe and the other european nations which have not yet lost all common sense is to defeat , rewrite and transform the fate intended for us . 
  lucky you . 
  because today it is written in the book of fate that withdrawal from the european union is the right of every eu member state . 
  go for it hungary , go for it hungarians !, 
  they pay their employees with bitcoin . 
  their salary is still denominated in euro . 
  and the employees can get a part of that salary in the form of bitcoins . 
  bitcoin is used as a way to make payments , similar to paypal . 
  nobody uses bitcoin as a currency . 
  so europeans are fanatic bigots too ? 
  if you apply for asylum you might get your treatment for free .
