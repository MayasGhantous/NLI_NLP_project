  the eu is basically a contract and it wo n't fall apart until everyone agrees to let it fall apart . 
  and there 's not a single government in the eu that wants the eu to collapse . 
  we might disagree about the implementation details , but everyone agrees that the eu is important . 
  and even countries that no longer want to be part of the eu have no interests in the collapse of the eu . 
  wait until you hear about the swedish holiday of knut that we celebrate in germany by burning our christmas trees and drinking gl\u00fchwein . 
  it 's weird . 
  to celebrate great tradition of eastern bloc textile industry . 
  back then we colored our rivers different color every day . 
  but stupid eu does no longer allow this . 
  hands-down st. patty 's day is the best american holiday . 
  today we all feel a little bit irish-american . 
   they should never be discriminated or attacked yet you are against a list of actions that want to prevent discrimination because you believe it would promote being transsexual . 
   nazism in germany is a crime no , it 's not . 
  the public display of symbols of illegal groups is a crime . 
  but you can decorate your private room with nazi symbols as much as you want . 
  just make sure that none of them are visible to the public . 
  and if the suspect is not suspected of having committed murder , manslaughter , grievous bodily harm , particularly grievous arson , or arson with lethal consequences you need reasons to arrest them . 
  if the judge believes that there is no risk that a suspect will flee , destroy evidence or influence witnesses they wo n't issue an arrest warrant . 
  you have to understand . 
  we are just the largest economic bloc in the world . 
  we ca n't deal with stuff like that . 
  every single asylum seeker is too many . 
  we are n't jordan for fucks sake !, 
   and then it 's just a matter of seeking a solution for the people stranded in greece that have n't yet returned to turkey/their countries on their own account . 
  and because deportations are incredibly hard , this solution will be relocation to other eu countries . 
  and even if that is not the case , the asylum seekers believe that exactly this will happen . 
  so they wo n't stop coming , because they believe they are the ones that will be able to enter the eu . 
  either legally or illegally . 
  and in 20-30 years romanians and bulgarians will complain about beggars and welfare leeches from western europe !, 
  according to the [ german report ] ( http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/virtueller-sklavenmarkt-is-verdient-millionen-mit-muettern-und-kindern/-/id=396/did=16551994/nid=396/trm875/ ) that this article is `` based '' on , there is ( or was ) an office in gaziantep that accepts the payments , unnoticed by turkish authorities . 
  that 's the role turkey plays . 
  apparently in this case google translate is too stupid to handle numbers with a space as thousands separator . 
  you do n't have to speak czech to see that this does not mean `` 184 to 500 '' :  tak jako on uva\u017euj\u00ed tis\u00edce dal\u0161\u00edch . 
  not sure what i paid back then , but the statistics are from 2012 . 
  the 1st half of 2015 [ statistics ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/ad/halfyearly_electricity_prices_%28eur_kwh%29.png ) from eurostat has it as 29.5 cent/kwh, 
  i think it has more to do with nimby . 
  everybody wants renewables , but nobody wants power lines near them . 
  `` why do we need to build ugly power lines ? 
  my electricity comes out of the outlet in the wall . 
  it already works ! '', 
  and you seem to believe that turks who want to become illegal immigrants can be stopped by visa requirements . 
  by now it should be pretty obvious that the schengen borders are far from impenetrable . 
  visa free travel means they are allowed to travel to the eu for 90 days for vacation or business . 
  where business means to attend meetings , not to work as an employee or contractor . 
  [ here 's a map of countries that have visa-free access to the schengen zone . 
  they are the green ones . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/schengen_visa_requirements.png ) . 
  people also claim that a cheap pizza and an expensive pizza are the same if they come from the same factory . 
  it 's not true . 
  ingredients are different quality and quantity . 
  in the case of clothing , i bet even the cut is different . 
  the material will be different as well . 
  and the expensive brand might actually have something like quality assurance . 
  according to the article , denmark showed the largest increase with +60.5 % . 
  what the article did n't mention , but the [ study ] ( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0924977x16000377 ) the article was based on did , was that the number of children who use antidepressants in denmark increased from 0.6 % to 1.0 % between 2005 and 2012 . 
  for comparison : - us : 26.1 % increase from 1.3 % to 1.6 % - uk : 54.4 % increase from 0.7 % to 1.1 % - netherlands : 17.6 % increase from 0.5 % to 0.6 % - germany : 49.2 % increase from 0.3 % to 0.5 %, 
  that 's what italy said last time as well . 
  they will very likely prolong the sanctions `` manually '' this time too . 
  hungary on the other hand ? 
  hungary wanted to buy military helicopters from russia . 
  russia wants to give hungary a couple sukhoi superjet airliners for free . 
  then there 's a deal for the hungarian nuclear plant , including a 10 billion euro loan from russia . 
  though the eu will very likely be able to ~ ~ convince ~ ~ bully hungary to extend the sanctions as well . 
  while you 're right , gazprom is a different beast . 
  you ca n't sanction them without dealing a major blow to the economy of the eu . 
  there would be no sanctions at all if the energy trade would be covered . 
  nobody in the eu wants to risk their economy for ukraine . 
  [ not even poland . 
  ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/social-europe-jobs/news/poland-wants-eu-to-complain-to-wto-over-russian-embargo/ ), 
  the point is to punish businesses and entities that are directly involved in , or profit from the invasion of eastern ukraine . 
  we do n't want to punish businesses and people for being russians . 
  we want to punish them for their actions . 
  not because of their nationality . 
  the majority of the sanctions target the military sector . 
  everyone can sign big deals with russia in areas that are n't covered by sanctions . 
  what you ca n't do is what hungary wants , buying military helicopters from russia . 
  because that is covered by sanctions . 
  no wonder western europe is so screwed up . 
  when normal people like you find idea of fathers defending their children so preposterous . 
  the world would be a better place if more fathers would beat the shit out of children . 
   and also the opening of borders to turk 's what specific problem do you see arise when turks get visa free access to the schengen zone ? 
   i just do n't understand how sweedish parents can let it happen . 
  probably afraid that a couple fathers of children that came with parents , gather and beat the shit out of them , with explicit warning that next time legs and arms will be broken . 
  it 's still hysteria !, 
  the uneducated general public just does n't know that nuclear energy is very safe if you abide by some rules . 
  1 . do n't be a stupid soviet 2 . do n't have tsunamis incidents in french nuclear power plants do n't matter . 
  they do n't have tsunamis and they are obvious not soviets because they are french . 
  so there 's nothing to fear . 
  water disabling an electric system ? 
  who cares ? 
  a disabled electric system has never lead to a major accident if you are n't soviet and do n't have tsunamis . 
  unfortunately we might have a third item on that list by 2030 . 
  but nuclear energy will continue to be safe if you abide these three rules ... 
  if only he knew that before he decided to killed people . 
   in fact , the largest foreigner minority in the czech republic is ukrainians , to whom we 're opening our doors quite warmly . 
  how many of them received asylum ? 
   the ease with which electrical power can cross borders that 's not how it works . 
  fun fact : due to increased voter turnout the cdu actually gained votes compared to 2011 in two of the three states that just held elections . 
  in saxony-anhalt , where afd got 24.2 % of the votes , the cdu received 11,104 more votes than in 2011 . 
  the relative change in that state was -2.7 percentage points .
