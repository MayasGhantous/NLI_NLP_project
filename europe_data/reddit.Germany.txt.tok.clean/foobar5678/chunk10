  so everyone who owns their home had a nice big net worth increase over the last 10 years . 
  do most british expats there own property ? 
  i assumed people went there because they were living on a pension and it goes further there . 
  until the uk leaves the eu ... 
  they do n't even need to do that . 
  i 'm sure they already have multiple cctv cameras pointed at the embassy . 
  if they see him leave , they 'll just dispatch some police to follow the car and inspect whoever gets out . 
  it 's not like he could drive out of the country . 
  maybe they could drive to a private airfield , but that would probably also be suspicious . 
  diplomats usually do n't fly in private jets . 
  we stopped acta . 
  that url ... `` fantastic map '' it 's one of the ugliest maps i 've ever seen . 
  `` syrian refugees '' we 've already established that most of them are n't syrian and most of them are n't refugees . 
  the people who are actual syrian refugees have nothing to do with this because they wo n't be deported . 
   * but even the gdr wall fell , and it fell 25 years ago , and we were all very happy . 
  it just could n't be maintained . 
  and so europe wo n't be able to transform into a fortress . 
  it wo n't work . 
  * uh , what ? 
  the wall fell because an entire empire collapsed . 
  and building fences to keep people out is completely different from building them to keep people in . 
  big demonstration in berlin on saturday . 
  come if you can !, 
  east germany is the least religious place in the world . 
  partially because the state took an active role in discouraging religion . 
   one study in september 2012 was unable to find a single person under 28 who believed in a god ( [ source ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/22/atheism-east-germany-godless-place ) ) we need to start this again . 
  we ca n't allow the youth of tomorrow to become more religious than the past . 
  this is why i do n't think it 's an issue about race or religion . 
  it 's about culture . 
  countries full of people who like beer and football get along well with other countries who like beer and football . 
  t\u00fcrkei loves both of those things . 
  immigrants to the us did n't integrate , they killed off the native population and started from scratch . 
  but forgetting about that , most of the immigrants after that came from white christian countries . 
  the cultural divide was n't that big . 
  mate , please add some paragraphs . 
  the comments in / r/europe and / r/germany differ in the exact same way that the comments in europe and germany differ . 
  this is the only issue the sub is right wing about . 
  for every other issue , the sub is as leftist as anywhere on reddit . 
  how about building something similar to the [ innerdeutsche grenze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inner_german_border ) . 
  people who have already been declared not to be refugees , and who break the law by illegally staying in the country , are allowed to be jailed . 
  how did this even need a ruling ? 
  difference between east and west : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:konfessionen_deutschland_zensus_2011.png yellow and purple = christian majority , blue = atheist majority . 
  popcorn tastes good . 
  you have that backwards, 
  you could apply for asylum and flat share with some syrians . 
  i used to do exactly that . 
  except after 2 years of living in poland , i could still only barely speak the language . 
  anyways , berlin is still pretty cheap . 
  any time you have adults who believe in fairy tales , you need to question their mental capacity . 
  then why is merkel pushing to equally distribute the migrants throughout the eu ? 
  poland would probably win in a war with germany, 
  white russia ? 
  they 're not really \\* important \\* i guess . 
   it 's not islamophobic to critisize the islamic view of women , lgbt etc. . 
  yes it is . 
  i hat the way muslims feel about women and lgbt people . 
  that makes me islamophobic . 
  it does n't make me a racist , because race has nothing to do with it , but their ideas are bad and dangerous and should be stamped out . 
  westboro baptist church members were n't allowed into the uk . 
  if extreme christian cults can be banned , why not extreme muslim ones ? 
  [ uk gains # 20bn from european migrants ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study ) [ immigration from outside europe ` cost # 120 billion ' ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11209234/immigration-from-outside-europe-cost-120-billion.html ) it 's dishonest to not separate the groups in statistics and just say `` immigration has a net positive effect . '', 
  because while it is technically true , it is far from the whole story . 
  the only reason immigration as a whole has a net positive effect is because most immigrants are from other eu countries , and they make up for the burden which is caused by the non-eu immigrants . 
  so we should just overlook when they commit crimes because otherwise they might resent us ? 
   the eastern state of thuringia already tries to house refugees separately depending on their country of origin , but declines to separate them by religion . 
  `` intensely religious '' muslims above all must learn to live with other religions , migration minister dieter lauinger said . 
  the problem with all policies they try to implement is that they lack any teeth . 
  yes , i think it is a good idea to house people of different religions together because they need to learn to get along . 
  but what about when one group attacks the other ? 
  then they need to be punished . 
  put their application on hold while they sit in prison awaiting trial . 
  they still get clothed , housed , and fed for 3 months while the application is processed . 
  also most of them do n't leave after having their request rejected . 
  they 're already being housed in former concentration camps . 
  we need a much more subtle approach . 
  schools needs to teach critical thinking and how to recognize logical fallacies . 
  we need to gently push students in the direction where they can realize for themselves that all religions are fake and there is no god . 
  i think society as a whole has already been moving in that direction , but with just a little bit of institutional support of atheism from the top , we would progress so much more . 
  but considering the cdu ( christian democratic union ) is in power , i do n't see that happening anytime soon . 
   germany needs to draw a line what is acceptable and what not ... the ones who use violence towards different religions or those who become criminal have to be punished yes !, 
  and we can not be flexible about it . 
  we can not excuse their actions by blaming it on cultural differences . 
  everyone in germany needs to be held to same set of rules . 
  if a group of migrants attacks another group for * any * reason , they need to be treated the same way that anyone else would be treated . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11896855/christian-and-muslim-refugees-should-be-housed-separately-says-german-police-chief.html imagine if i got 60 friends together and we went and attacked a group of migrants . 
  and yet no charges have been brought against any of the migrants here committing violent assaults . 
  good video . 
  it 's not indiscriminate though . 
  if there is a minefield and a sign which says `` do n't walk here , this is a mine field '' and you read the sign and then choose to walk across it anyways . 
  i mean , you kinda had it coming . 
  just saying , the berlin wall , terrible as it was , worked really well . 
  you ca n't deny that . 
  europe and the us will be fine . 
  there might be a quality of life downgrade , but we 're not going to run out of water . 
  i do think you underestimate the total military dominance that the west has over the rest of the world . 
  the holocaust took place with 1940s technology while also fighting the biggest war in history on two fronts . 
  imagine what we could do today with modern technology . 
  we could do a holocaust 2.0 and literally kill every single person in africa and the middle east if we wanted . 
  but we do n't want to , and that 's a good thing . 
  but it 's also important to remember that we have that power .
