  there is n't going to be 100 million africans storming into europe unless we decide that 's what we want . 
  unfortunately , the cold hard truth is that might makes right . 
  it might be against the rules , but i only see two options here . 
  ( 1 ) break this specific rule . 
  no one can do anything to stop us anyways . 
  or ( 2 ) wait for a populist right wing government to get elected that 'll do far worse . 
  in the us , the people who said their biggest issue was the economy , voted for hilary . 
  the people who said their biggest issue was migration and terrorism voted for trump . 
  we are seeing a resurgence in right wing populism in europe and it is completely driven by migration and terrorism . 
  because that 's exactly what happened in berlin . 
  if we take in all the qualified doctors and engineers , then their countries will never improve . 
  i like the way south korea and other asian countries do it . 
  the government pays to send its brightest students to universities in the us or europe . 
  but on the condition that after they complete their education , they return and teach at local schools or work for the government for x number of years . 
  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/german-row-over-middle-finger-of-varoufakis-takes-absurd-turn-1.2146053  it did n't take long , however , until the fake was itself revealed as a fake . 
   the original footage of the event does appear to show mr varoufakis showing the stinkefinger . 
  the finger-free `` original '' as shown on neo magazin royale was , in fact , the doctored one .

  15 % comes from the gulf . 
  that 's still a lot of money . 
  but anyways , that just makes the argument even easier because it 's so much more obtainable . 
  replace * only * 15 % with renewables and you defund the gulf . 
  you 'd think that american nationalists would be the most pro-renewable energy people out there . 
  invest in renewables and you defund these regimes . 
  that 's what the democrats should be saying to win them over . 
  drop the hippie `` save the planet '' nonsense and reframe the debate around the funding of middle eastern militaries . 
  it 's almost like religion is just a tool to control people . 
  and colonization is n't in vogue these days . 
   the uk has the fastest growing gdp percentage out of all the g7 nations . 
  but also , the uk manufacturing industry has declined at the fastest pace of the g7 economies and britain has the highest ratio of services exports to gdp in the g7 . 
  britain 's gdp is also more dependent on financial services than any other of the g7 . 
  that is all going to take a hit with brexit . 
  it 's easy to import a car , but a lot more difficult to export labour to foreign services . 
  when the eu was formed , europe had almost the same number of people as the americas + africa . 
  * today * , the americas + africa have almost 3x the population of europe . 
  europeans have already become the minorities on a global scale . 
  it 's far from absurd to think it will happen on a local scale as well . 
  the problem with that , is there is no way that we can take in a billion people from africa . 
  when our parents were kids , europe had twice the population of africa . 
  within 10 years , africa will have twice the population of europe . 
  in 50 years , they are projected to have five times the population of europe . 
  we ca n't just keep taking in more and more people while their population is exploding . 
  this current migrant crisis is the practice test for what we 're going to see in the future . 
  and so far , we 're failing . 
  what we need to do is establish much stricter border security . 
  letting millions of people walk all the way across europe was completely mental . 
  i still ca n't believe multiple governments let that happen without stopping them . 
  then we need to establish a system for setting up safe refugees camps for people ( outside of europe ) and transporting them there . 
  we do n't have unlimited revenue to throw at the problem , and we can help * more * people if they 're outside the eu . 
  if sweden decides to spend x % of their tax revenue helping refugees , they can bring 100,000 people to sweden and take care of them , or they build a camp in turkey and help 1,000,000 people . 
  it 's expensive to clothe , house , and feed someone in sweden . 
  it 's much cheaper in other countries . 
  by sending the people and the revenue there , we can help * many * more people . 
  just a quick google says the eu will spend [ # 20 billion this year alone ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/678878/migrant-crisis-cost-20bn-experts-reveal-shock-price-eu-pay ) on the migrant crisis . 
  for that money , we could build an entire city from scratch in some african country . 
  and we would be putting them to work to build it . 
  there 's no reason to hand out benefits and take in endless people . 
  we should help them help themselves by funding/building sustainable cities * outside * of europe . 
  it would be great if we could buy an island like tasmania , and declare it a un governed refugee country . 
  anyone who wants to go there , can go there , and we would manage the whole thing . 
   in spring 2014 , as the kremlin made moves to annex crimea , putin was under the illusion that the west , particularly europe , would allow him to fulfil his expansionist desires and would approve , even silently , the annexation of the ukrainian territories populated by pro-russia groups . 
   by the time it became clear this was wrong , a full-scale war was raging in two ukrainian regions ; a malaysian airlines plane had been shot down over ukraine ; the g8 had reverted to the g7 ; putin 's closest friends were on international sanctions lists , and russia was more isolated internationally for the first time since the afghan war . 
   with russia now a key player in syria , the west is once again forced to negotiate with moscow . 
  russian army attacks are now targeting not just isis strongholds , but also pro-western opposition bases . 
  the aim is to prolong the war , thereby ensuring russia 's place at the international negotiation table and legitimising the kremlin 's foreign policy . 
   ** it is a pr coup in russia and abroad and nothing will change until western leaders talk to putin - not about syria , but about ukraine and sanctions . 
  ** tl ; dr : they want to show people at home and abroad that russia is acting with legitimacy when they send soldiers into foreign countries . 
  and to do that , they 're sending them into a conflict that makes them look like the good guys while also hurting the west . 
   well , of course not hungary does n't have a duty to take * anyone * if they do n't want . 
  refugees need to stay in the region they come from , in the nearest safe countries . 
  this idea that anyone in the world can just hitchhike to europe if they 're unhappy is complete insanity . 
  if a country * wants * to invite refugees , or if they take them directly from the camps and shelters ( like what the uk does ) , then of course that is fine . 
  but forcing people upon other countries , when those people should n't have been here in the first place , is not a solution .
