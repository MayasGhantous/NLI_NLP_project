  it 's not tourists that 's the problem . 
  logistics companies are driving lorries * through * our country to ship supplies to/from eastern europe . 
  the german tax payer is essentially subsidizing the foreign companies on either side of them , by providing them with good roads ( which they then cause lots of wear and tear on , but pay none of the repair costs ) . 
   nobody in their right mind will invest or keep their existing investments intact . 
  is n't this already the case with greece ? 
  nothing we can do will make people want to invest in them . 
  why should we have to pay more in taxes for the damage caused by foreigners ? 
  if they want to wear down our roads , let them pay a toll . 
  you can be in the eu without having the euro . 
  poland does n't have the euro because it does n't qualify . 
  is the concept of europe dead because poland is n't on the euro ? 
  just move greece back into the `` does not qualify for euro '' category and take it away from them . 
  leave everything else . 
  greece never should have got the euro in the first place . 
  this is n't even really the same as taking it away from it , it 's just making the correction for an error which never should have occurred . 
  if you do n't know what he 's talking about : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11420627/german-army-used-broomsticks-instead-of-guns-during-training.html, 
  writing * hurr durr * as a way to make the person you 're mocking look like an idiot , only serves to make yourself look like an idiot . 
  i wish reddit would stop it . 
   because culture absolutely matters to a bank . 
  also implying germany does n't have cultural opportunities . 
  let 's be fair , frankfurt sucks . 
  i would move to london before moving to frankfurt . 
   it is interesting that the four leading financial centres in that study all use the english language and english law . 
  english language is n't surprising , but common law is . 
  especially when you consider that civil law is more prevalent . 
  for people ( like me ) who do n't know what those numbers mean . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_financial_centres_index * london : 2nd * frankfurt : 19th https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial_centre#international_financial_centres_development_index * london : 2nd * frankfurt : 8th interesting that the first index puts paris at 37th ( way behind frankfurt ) and the second index puts paris at 7th ( ahead of frankfurt ) . 
  well , this is one way to get your point across ... http://i.imgur.com/rryxw8s.jpg, 
  looks like only the us , uk , and estonia meet the 2 % http://uk.businessinsider.com/only-us-and-estonia-meeting-nato-budget-goal-2015-2?r=us, 
  now i want to play [ axis & allies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axis_%26_allies ) . 
  do they not remember the result of that war ? 
  finland had to give over pechengsky ... 
  i think it 's more of a joke . 
  like / r/murica / people in russia just want to be proud of their country . 
  they do n't actually believe everything they post , it 's just a laugh . 
   this is typical , but invalid `` argument '' , an offspring organism is a separate `` body '' . 
  ok , and the human body contains 10x as many foreign cells compared to cells of it 's own . 
  does that mean you only have a right to 1/10th of your body ? 
  what if you give someone a kidney in a transplant . 
  do you still own that kidney even when it 's in someone else 's body ? 
  what if you gave someone a kidney under very specific conditions ( e.g. 
  they can only have it if they go to church every week ) . 
  if they miss a week of church , could you demand that the kidney be forcefully taken from them ? 
  what a stupid fucking argument ... 
  and i 'm here in berlin thinking that even $ 250 would be way too expensive for that tiny flat . 
  the israeli settlement tactic , but on smaller scale . 
  i 'd watch out sweden , finland is coming for you . 
  that still does n't mean i want lead in my water . 
  germany was the most technologically advanced country in the world * before * ww2 . 
  is it not illegal for public officials to knowingly lie to the public ? 
  when about situations like in hungary where they were throwing rocks and bottles and the border guards ? 
  the guards only retaliated with tear gas and they got a ton of hate for that . 
  if someone is trying to break into your country , and they 're throwing fucking bottles at you , then you should be allowed to shoot back . 
  ( `` stop , stand still or i will shoot '' ) . 
  * next , to fire a warning shot ; typically the border police carried kalashnikov assault rifles or sks semiautomatic carbines . 
  * finally , if the fugitive failed to comply , an aimed shot , preferably aimed at the legs , was to be fired to stop the person you 've given them plenty of warning . 
  they know what 's going to happen and what is at risk if they continue trying to illegally cross the border . 
  if they 're willing to voluntarily take that risk , knowing the consequences , then what 's the problem ? 
  anyways , how many people would need to be shot at before they got the message ? 
  there are facts and statistics on this . 
  just look at the [ oecd report ] ( http://www.oecd.org/edu/universal-basic-skills-9789264234833-en.htm ) . 
  across the board , in every eu country , 2nd generation immigrants perform at levels far far below the natives . 
  they contribute much less and use more social programs . 
  it does n't matter that you know some great immigrants and he knows some crappy ones . 
  anecdotes only serve to derail the conversation . 
  the oecd report has facts . 
  http://www.oecd.org/edu/universal-basic-skills-9789264234833-en.htm 2nd generation immigrants in the netherlands , on average , have employment rates which are 20 percentage points lower than their native counterparts . 
  their academic ability ( despite being born in the netherlands , growing up there , going to the same dutch schools , etc ) is so far behind their native counterparts that it 's the equivalent to 2 years of schooling . 
   the only option is to grow the tax base to keep feeding these programs . 
  ( 1 ) with automation , we can sustain our standard of living with fewer jobs and fewer people working . 
  in fact , the more people you have , the more welfare you need to provide . 
  fewer people is better for europe . 
  ( 2 ) the migrants do n't generate net positive income in any eu country , even after living here for years . 
  we should n't do that either . 
  we should only sell weapons to other nato countries . 
  not doing * anything * = fearful, 
  why do n't they make their own nice cities instead of using ours ? 
  that 's the thing ... you shoot one boat and they stop coming . 
  at the end of the day , you 've actually saved lives because less people will attempt the dangerous trip and drown . 
  but our leaders are cowards and paralyzed by fear . 
  edit :  * yes , we have been given power and yes , that power gives us the right to rule , but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled . 
  where we are opposed , as we surely will be , this must be the basis of all our counterarguments . 
  we seize control for the greater good . 
  and from this it follows that where we meet resistance , we must use only the force that is necessary and no more . 
  mass deportation . 
  if they do n't say where they are from , let them stay in a detention center until they decide they want to go home . 
  and they have to actually be deported . 
  telling them to go to home and then letting them decide when and where does n't work . 
  they obviously do n't leave . 
  they started fighting years before the blockade happened . 
  the blockade did n't start until well after isreal disowned the territory and said they could keep it . 
  my understanding is that there is n't any support anymore for left wing parties in israel . 
  he 's talking about a small city state becoming a wealthy country , like singapore . 
  realistically , that probably would n't have happened . 
  but it 's undeniable that the people in gaza are making lives worse for themselves because they 'd rather shoot rockets at isreal instead of using those funds to be productive . 
  plus , the biggest damage to gaza comes from the blockade . 
  which exists to stop smuggling weapons into gaza . 
  if the people in gaza would just accept that that 's their home now and they 're not going to defeat israel , then they could turn gaza into a much better place . 
  it does n't help that hamas gets its power and support from anti-israli and pro-terrorist sentiments . 
  the ruling power in the area has a vested interested in keeping the fight going as long as possible .
