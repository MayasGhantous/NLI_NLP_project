  large muslim immigrant population and people are sympathic towards muslims than americans are . 
  israel has been caught spying on the us countless times . 
  they do n't treat the us like an ally or a friend . 
  if you look at the definition of a country , palestine does n't quite meet the criteria . 
  can we stop selling weapons to isreal plz ? 
  people also overestimate their competency . 
  the paris authorities knew there was going to be an attack on a rock venue . 
  because the first guy isis sent to do it bailed on the mission and told them everything . 
  the authorities didnt have to do anything to get the information and they did n't do anything with the information . 
  remove the uk and it has n't changed by much . 
  there are only a handful of ethnic europeans in isis . 
  almost all of them are 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants . 
  although in a lot of countries , a 3rd generation immigrant is considered ethnically [ whatever country is ] . 
  a guy who 's grandparents moved from afghanistan to sweden 35 years ago is now considered `` ethnically swedish . '', 
  it allows to media to manipulate the entire narrative . 
  i am also a liberal . 
  which is why i stand up for liberal ideas like equal rights for women and homosexuals . 
  supporting people who go against these core liberal ideas is not liberal . 
  tolerance must never be applied to intolerance . 
  i love british food . 
  [ pork pies ] ( http://www.williamsfarmkitchen.co.uk/wp_admin/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/3-family-pork-pies-pork-430g.jpg ) , [ scotch eggs ] ( http://images.edge-generalmills.com/833b2ade-23d3-4c62-b04d-16438c2fc60e.jpg ) , [ black pudding ] ( http://www.stephensfreshfoods.co.uk/ekmps/shops/stephensfresh/images/black-pudding-stick-x-164-p[ekm]288x230[ekm].jpg ) , and [ the best breakfast ] ( http://static.thaivisa.com/forum/uploads/monthly_04_2014/post-42474-0-43441400-1396324187.jpg ) in the world . 
  also mince meat pies , and brandy butter !, 
  we have [ stippgr\u00fctze ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stippgr%c3%bctze ) in germany , but i 'll choose haggis over it any day . 
  sign me up !, 
  this is great . 
  i 'd say that other than poland and portugal , all of these are accurate . 
  although romania + honey and hungary + lard is a bit wtf , i do n't know enough about romanian honey to dispute it . 
  i also think it 's funny that , for the purposes of this map , they treated scotland as a separate country even though the stereotype is about how it is n't a separate country . 
   the term first-generation can refer to either people who were born in one country and relocated to another at a young age , or to their children born in the country they have relocated to . 
  the term second-generation refers to children of first-generationimmigrants , and thus exhibits the same ambiguity . 
  2ng generation . 
  the first generation is the first generation to be born there and spend their lives there . 
  but yes , native dutch could apply to someone who 's family moved there 15 years ago . 
  i wish berlin would legalize . 
  it 's already bought and smoked openly . 
  i just wish it was available through reputable suppliers instead of `` some guy '', 
  sawdust and hooves, 
   illegals tend to give more to the country than they receive . 
  the us gives it 's own citizens very very little . 
  it 's no surprise that illegals get even less than that . 
  it 's not an example that we should aspire to . 
  [ same reason ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/03/europe-islamism-and-some-uncomfortable-home-truths/ ) why poland [ does n't have ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/30/how-safe-are-we-on-holiday-5273338/ ) this problem . 
  they also want the uk and france to give up their seat on the un security council and instead have 2 eu politicians on the council . 
  i mean ... you 're not wrong . 
  the soviets locked up priests and executed religious leaders . 
  instead of the christian `` confirmation '' , children had an alternative ( called jugendweihe ) which was a confirmation of atheism and the socialist state . 
  there is a reason why western german is very christian and eastern german is literally the least religious place on earth . 
  these attacks are also sadly common in turkey as opposed to virtually unheard of in belgium . 
   and in denial about it that 's the worse part . 
  if the politicians would admit that a problem exists , then we could talk about solutions . 
  but the denial is off the charts . 
   they 're perfectly willing to override our national democracies . 
  yes ... 
  this is problematic . 
  i still believe the eu can be reformed though . 
  britain should n't leave , they should help us reform the eu . 
  if the problems continue , have the brexit vote in a couple years . 
  there 's no reason to rush it right now . 
   there are like a few thousand potential violent extremists in europe let us firstly make sure that number does n't increase . 
  fortress europe, 
  it was also more of a war , not random mass shootings . 
  should guerrilla attacks be put into the same category as pure terrorism ? 
  isis is trying to start shit up and create panic ( i. . e create terror ) . 
  the ira was ( arguably ) trying to be left alone , not create panic . 
  not justifying what they did . 
  but they do n't seem like they should be put in the same category . 
  luckily we do n't have to worry about anyone attacking the airport in berlin . 
  if you do n't count ireland/uk then that number goes way down . 
  they have no connection to their european hosts . 
  they only moved here within the last 50 years and most live in their own expat communities . 
  firstly , black people did n't go to the us by choice . 
  the us has an obligation to take care of them . 
  we have no such obligation . 
  secondly , they have lived in the us for 200 + years . 
  for most of the muslims in europe , their parents or grandparents who originally moved here are still alive . 
  it 's a much more recent thing . 
  leaving us a permanent decision . 
  but if referendum votes to remain , and circumstances change in a few years , you can always have another one . 
  better to play it safe . 
  most of the arguments i see against the eu are about how things are n't that bad now , but could get worse later . 
  ok , we 'll why not wait to see if that actually starts to happen and then have a vote . 
  a couple years after brexit you 'll just be able to use your scottish passport . 
  no worries there . 
  the soviet union sealed off the entirety of eastern europe from western europe . 
  this border is much smaller . 
  this might sound naive , but ca n't you just swim across the river ? 
  unless you 're very old or very young . 
  we do n't need to enforce anything . 
  if we just stop helping them get here , that would be enough . 
  they literally sink their own boats a few kilometers off the coast of turkey and then greece ferries them over to europe . 
  europe could just stop patrolling those waters and that 'll immediately reduce the flow . 
  also , relocate the native population from from of the small greek islands near turkey back to mainland greece . 
  if the migrants want to live alone on a deserted greek island , they 're more than welcome to do so . 
  we 're not obligated go around searching every island and every square kilometer looking for asylum seekers . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  you obviously ca n't fence off an island , but building fences in other places is not a radical idea . 
  first people said building a fence on the hungarian border would n't work . 
  now they say it 's * only * 175km . 
  yeah , it 's only 175km , but they built it in just a few weeks . 
  condoms are not mandatory .
