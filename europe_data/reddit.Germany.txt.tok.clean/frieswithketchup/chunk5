  i pay less than 250 $ / month for 50 % coverage . 
  my employer takes care of the other 50 % . 
  healthcare is not free here and being a doctor is still highly profitable in germany without bankrupting people for needing medical attention . 
  who decides then ? 
   we basically would have told the world that we do n't care how corrupt you are are you for real ? 
  you think trump is not corrupt ? 
  you do n't get to declare bankruptcy as often and on as big a scale as he did by not being corrupt . 
  constitutions can be changed ( though it 's not easy to do in the us ) . 
  the long lasting effects of trump will be felt in the supreme court . 
   the first military engagement of world war ii ** in europe ** . 
  ftfy, 
  any prime minister in the uk in at least the last 50 years has been as unelected as her . 
  the people who go out to vote in elections do n't give a shit about marijuana . 
  there needs to be another megathread , now that we have the result . 
  history . 
  there were already independent national football associations in the british countries who separately joined international governing organizations . 
  it meant that having an abortion was a trip to the netherlands . 
  her mother comes from scottish nobility . 
  what were they asking about specificly ? 
  thank you . 
  it looks very promising . 
  can you recommend any small towns like this along a6 or a7 ? 
  i 'll be in provence in may and i do n't have anything other than autoroute planned from avignon to besancon on the way back . 
  it 's not like the us soldiers left germany as soon as the treaties were signed . 
  there are still more than enough troops here that cause air and noise pollution almost 30 years after reunification . 
  tbf the solidarity tax is just money that goes to the federal government ( and they do n't have to share with the states ) . 
  it 's not earmarked for anything . 
  now that it 's there , it wo n't go away anytime soon . 
  and another place to visit this year . 
  it fits nicely into my route back home . 
  they think it 's cute . 
  it looks like that because we could convince americans and japanese to pay for the rebuild of the old town . 
  even during the bombing in wwii a big part was spared because the us general who ordered the bombing did n't want the whole historic town destroyed . 
   so do you believe employers pay a woman less than a man for the same exact job for no good reason ? 
  when a man asks for more money he is seen as ambitious , when a woman asks she is often seen as arrogant . 
  as long as successful men are seen as `` ambitious '' and successful women are seen as `` arrogant '' ( or as long as the woman is seen as the `` natural caretaker '' ) we have not reached equality . 
  when the default in childcare is for the mother to take a step back in her career to take care of a child and society looks at fathers who take time off like they are a pink unicorn , we have a long way to go . 
  the esta form online is not a visa . 
  for a visa to the us , you have to go to a us consulate and explain what you want to do . 
  even if there is no objective reason to deny you a visa and everything goes smoothly you pay at least $ 160 and spend at least 2 hours . 
  if you do n't live close to the consulate , you basically have to spend a whole day . 
   we only spent 700 $ for both trips per person , but whatever . 
  how long did you stay in the us ? 
  does that include the whole trip ( transportation , accommodation , food , etc ) ? 
  the fact that even those with valid visas already traveling can be denied entry makes people more hesitant . 
  i was on vacation in the us for three weeks last year , and between the three of us we probably spent more than $ 7000 total . 
  i would not want to spend that much money when the government openly questions whether to withdraw my countries participation in the visa-waiver-program . 
  as long as there is no federal law about it , they can apply it in bavaria . 
  anybody wondering why other germans do n't like bavaria , this video should explain it all . 
  the first lady is ivanka ; melania is just married to the president . 
  that 's more a pygmy slave than a child . 
  luckily our people are not reliant on tips alone . 
  germans will say that about east berlin , though .

  napoleon took away our independence and made us part of bavaria . 
  how can that ever be a good thing ?? 
  why exactly ? 
  any carbonated drink has to be sold with a refund ( not in restaurants , so mcdonalds gets a pass ) . 
  this law has been in effect since 2003 . 
  however the amount is not set . 
  beer bottles can be as cheep as 8 cents . 
  cheap bottles can be as much as 25 cents . 
  lots of people do n't consider 8 cents to be worth enough to pick up after themselves . 
  she politically `` murdered '' anybody who would be a danger to her power . 
  there is the csu ; historically they have been more right-wing than merkel 's cdu . 
  however they form one faction in federal parliament , because they do n't compete for votes ( csu only exists in bavaria ; cdu exists everywhere else ) . 
  in general in germany , anybody who is right of the cdu/csu is considered to close to neo-nazis . 
  germans do n't like to go there , so we vote for established conservatives . 
  again , that never happened to me . 
  how many tabloid covers have you been featured on ? 
  i have never been on any . 
  and i 've lived in germany for over 25 years . 
  i think it 's one of the worst jobs . 
  there is no job description and everybody has an opinion on how you should do your job . 
  everybody looks on closely on what and who you do . 
  there is no privacy . 
  i used to drive by there on my commute . 
  whenever i was waiting in traffic it brought a smile to my face to just look there and imagine just that . 
  two things : 1 ) they are sharing the building with a gym . 
  2 ) i was there a few times several years ago and their service was abysmal . 
  the kfc an exit before and the mcdonalds an exit after are far faster and actually deserve to be called `` fast food '' . 
  i 'm not waiting 15 minutes for a burger at bk . 
  there are plenty of buildings from that time that still have the reichsadler ( just without the swastika ) . 
  you will never conquer us ( napoleon already did . ), 
  it happened that way because germans did n't `` appreciate '' the genius that kohl saw himself to be . 
  he was at the right place at the right time and he knew how to use that . 
  when germans tired of him treating the governement and his party like his personal fiefdom , he felt betrayed . 
  he ( and later his second wife ) did n't want to give german politicians the opportunity to honor him . 
  in europe he was seen as some great man , in germany he was just another corrupt politician . 
  at least maike kohl-richter 's legacy now is secure : the woman who took kohl from the german people and his family . 
  keep in mind , that one of the first things merkel did as chancellor was the right to have a child care spot . 
  conservative values in germany dictate that a mother stays home for at least the child 's first three years . 
  it 's perfect for the campaign . 
  spd has shown their are willing to work with `` die linke '' on a federal level . 
  there will be quite a few people who will concentrate on that . 
  i do n't know about that . 
  this is purely personal anecdote , but i 've noticed that people change their opinion if it affects people they know . 
  my parents were always very much against gay marriage . 
  but then their neighbor 's daughter came out . 
  she lives an hour away , but they saw her struggle with her grandmother 's denial .
