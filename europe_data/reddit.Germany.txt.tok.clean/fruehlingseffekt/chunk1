sorry greenland is reserved . 
   seeing what germany has done before . 
  what exacly do you mean by that ? 
  is this a ww2 reference , or is your opinion based on some more recent events ? 
  not sure if conspiriancy or sarcasm . 
  ze end is near !, 
   the next one is 2 days older ... you also conveniently picked the one where the afd is always the highest compared to other surveys . 
  so why did you sourced the survey in which the afd is listed lowest instead of the next recent , the 2 days older one ? 
  convinience ? 
   you picked the one that supported your view , i picked just the one where the afd was always the lowest compared to other surveys . 
  ` our ' = ` you ' and ` me ' . 
  that 's just you prefering `` your '' view against up-to-dateness/recent events . 
   no , i don \u00b4 t know where you get that . 
  even in the insa survey the afd lost 0.5 % from the last survey . 
  i 'm refering to the numbers from my source , and claim that there 's an general upward trend too , you do the math . 
  :p  you seem to adjust numbers based on how you feel about the current situation and how you feel the population should feel . 
  i did n't `` adjust '' any numbers , all these numbers are publicly accessible . 
  i just took the latest results , so im good . 
  what 's `` our '' view by the way ? 
  i know that you need 5 % to get a seat , but if the trend/mismanagement continues ... see you in the bundestag . 
  what do you mean by `` stuff '' like this . 
  you mean like china ? 
  while it 's true pegida demos peaked early this year , the numbers are rising again . 
  the afd gets more supporters every week too . 
  you should learn how to swing the nazi bat , what has this to do with jews anyway ? 
  so what is v4 giving to have unrestricted market access in germany ? 
  take a look at cdu and afd values . 
  26.08.2015 - 21.09.2015 cdu -3,5 % / afd +2,5 % if elections where next sunday ... [ http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/insa.htm] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/insa.htm ) afd - anti-immigration cdu - pro-asyl, 
  the counter protest where partly state financed . 
  if germany is buying its own exports , it 's a null sum game . 
  pure act of charity . 
  i just wanted to know , if you want to keep it to yourself it 's ok with me . 
  i 'm just wondering do n't you have a position ? 
   hope dies last . 
  do you believe in god , or are you atheist ? 
  i know that rotterdam is the biggest port in europe , no wonder ... the netherlands are a maritime nation with many over sea territories + iselmeer . 
  i agree on agreeing and i did ' t suppose to come across arrogant . 
  where 's the joke ? 
  oh welcome , you 're an idiot too . 
  you are misinformed . 
  whats your source ? 
  mine is : http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/158303/umfrage/deutsche-exporte-und-importe-2010-nach-laendergruppen/ and germany has given out at least 50 bln.credits to greece alone , let alone ireland and portugal ( which recovered , instead of greece ) . 
  we are the biggest funders of eu anyway . 
  however you turn it , greek economy is relying on eu/german funds , i have to fucking pay for it . 
  yeah , greek bank controls ... on the people , while those rich greeks do n't pay taxes at all , who does , in greece ? 
  bulgaria is bordering turkey/greece ... what 's your point ? 
  germany 's primary source of wealth is exports , and it is n't focused on eu , it 's worldwide usa , china , russia , india . 
  we are financing our eu exports by ourselfes , every country buying german products in the eu is basically financed by the eu/germany . 
  greece fucked up ? 
  have a check , buy your mercedes . 
  the quota distribution-key is adjusted to population/gdp , but the xenophopia is n't taken into account , agree . 
  the pooooooor ee countries , always the victim . 
  ca n't handle , ca n't deal . 
  of course we do , we should suspend our eu-spending accordinally because the eu mainly consists of leeching countries . 
  yes ee , you have n't payed a dime !, 
  germany takes 40 % of applications + housing , but east europe is just saying , not my beer . 
  solution would be : 1 . 
  join russia in syria even on assads side , and see where it leads us afterwards , stop turkey fighting the kurds . 
  more countries have to contribute forces to patrol the mediterranean sea , eventually pushbacks . 
  external refugee camps : lybia , turkey , bulgaria . 
  stop this chaos !, 
  vattenpistol = wasserpistole please try harder swedish , 
  france , poland , netherlands , greece ... just kidding , just kidding . 
   it 's actually [ namibia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germany%e2%80%93namibia_relations ) north-west of south africa . 
  because it 's the only `` ex-colony '' we maintain special relations with . 
  mathew 25:37 - 43 37 `` then the righteous will answer him , ` lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you something to drink ? 
  38 when did we see you a stranger and invite you in , or needing clothes and clothe you ? 
  39 when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you ? ' 40 `` the king will reply , ` truly i tell you , whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine , you did for me . ' 41 `` then he will say to those on his left , ` depart from me , you who are cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels . 
  42 for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat , i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink , 43 i was a stranger and you did not invite me in , i needed clothes and you did not clothe me , i was sick and in prison and you did not look after me . ', 
  the same logic is behind this : no job - they are leeching on our social benefits !, 
  job - they are taking away our jobs !, 
  that 's correct . 
  business first , as usual . 
  he 's late . 
  the german minister for economy visited iran last month . 
  europe is just a bunch of xenophobic cowards , and this crisis shows it crystal clear . 
  how do you know how this budget is spend ? 
  cherrypicking like always , good job uk . 
  wrong , she wants everybody to do their share , not the same !, 
  that does n't mean everybody has to process asylum applications a.k.a. 
  `` taking refugees '' . 
  it includes everything from frontex border partols , financial/humanterian aid and fighting isis . 
  how should germany able to this all on it 's own , we need a holistic approach . 
  is n't it sad that your oil is burried below their sand ? 
  all for the greater good of berlin ... 
  whats the point of having `` devopment aid '' when you are rejecting people from warzones that your gov. 
  is actively bombing ? 
  thats like selling opium to china and call it `` bilateral economical relationships '' . 
  geography does n't matter in this question , the one thing you have is the channel , but people cross the mediterranean sea to get europe , so theres no point . 
  geographically sweden is as much more north as you , but get more refugees , there is nothing `` natural '' . 
  the thing is that the uk is much more open to their former colonies or commonwealth nations , but anybody else including europe ... not my tea . 
  you are the european nation furthest from european borders , yes that makes perfect sense . 
  nigel farrage : when would you like to leave this undemocratic , economically failed , fascist , self declared eu-empire . 
  [ ] now [ ] yes, 
  that 's a simple question . 
  why did you prefer europe/germany over i.e. 
  uae ? 
  give your reasons and apply it to refuguees . 
  austria actually spends real money on schengen , unlike the uk , with it 's laughable frontex `` gifts '' . 
  violation of dublin is not against the law , it 's an inter-european agreement , which nobody cares about .
