  after all , there are constitution in europe , and that overrides any eu-law . 
  human dignity is n't eu conform i guess . 
  there are no human rights , they treat poors like trash and all of them are locked up in a society that does n't allow any renewal . 
  there 's also no academic career to strive for . 
  no industry , just sand and oil . 
  i 've read that there are more books translated to english in ger every year than there are books published in arabic . 
  people are striving , thats why . 
  edit : minor argumentative enhancements . 
  isis fighters are in irak/syria , why would european radical converts actually go there if they could do much harm at home ? 
  plus you ca n't tell a terrorist apart from a normal person at all . 
  bayerns expense , as usual . 
  i really do n't mind , as long as i get some [ english drama ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqhavm8onmq ) . 
  do n't forget the era of the hanse . 
  i care . 
  the best about it is the bbc pundits pre-match/post-match disparity . 
  that 's a really bad idea , it kills competitivness within the ez by reversing stimuli . 
  act uneconomical -  get money act economical -  loose money, 
  do it as the chinese , not have island , make island . 
  somewhere the money has to go , it 's not like nobody saw it coming . 
  you can take our us-bases + the nukes if you want . 
  add a wind turbine at the top of it and chances are good that you 'll get the nod . 
  test balloon . 
  i 'm against unregulated immigration . 
  in my view that 's neither particullary left nor right . 
  the emphazis is on - unregulated - , i 'm fine with immigarion + taking refugees , as long as there is a plan for the benefit of all . 
  we have to make this work . 
  but all i can see is patchwork , rush and in a sad amibigous sense , fire brigade solutions . 
  exactly , some people fail to realize this . 
  as long as you do n't make any new debts the total is declining . 
  this does n't apply to gdp-ratios however . 
  another fine piece of desinformation . 
  timber is increasingly cut down due to wood-pellet production , which interestingly is considered ecological contributing . 
  romania is illegally deforestated because a million europeans think heating their homes with wood is environmentally friendly . 
  lets just say we have [ something in common ] ( http://www.footandball.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1966-uwe-seeler.jpg ) . 
  silkroad 2.0 inc. 
  those magnet ( upper right ) , they look exacly like out former gdr little traffic-light men . 
  so calculating back a pack in around 1990 would 've cost 2,50 dm . 
  dream on . 
  of course , the alternative is singing david hasselhoffs - `` i 've been looking for freedom '' and bringing down a random wall with it . 
  did n't want to write `` he was an economist '' , assuming he still is one . 
  you have a point there . 
  \\* sobbing \\* our exchange rate was 1 euro = 2 d-mark . 
  a pack of cigarettes used to be 5 dm , now it 's 5 euros . 
  whats your experience ? 
  losing to england ... in ' 66 ? 
  merkel is a physicists , and some are arguing that it influences her political style `` analysing , step-by-step ` ish , hesatating '' . 
  i do n't think that the personal expertise does n't matters at all . 
  there should be a difference between a marketing-salesman and a judge for instance . 
  tsipras is an civil engineer , samaras is an economist . 
  what academic profession would be most helpful for reforming is my question . 
  maybe a judge is more fitting than an economist or civil engineer . 
  i mean judges ought to be just/fair by definition . 
  perhaps she 's able to spread the social expenses more evenly instead of focusing on account balances alone . 
  she should know the ins and outs of the greek legislation and also the gaps in law , which she then could get rid of . 
  just my thoughts . 
  never happend to me , if `` nazis/ww2 '' would n't ring a bell i would probably say : `` right in the middle of europe , east of france . 
  cars , beer , lederhosen . 
  but i wonder how americans would describe the state they are from when it 's not cali , texas , hawaii or alaska . 
  kansas . 
  `` right in the middle '' ? 
  known for ? 
  superman ? 
  krakau has an university , and warsaw , well , warsaw . 
  ... which does n't exists at all . 
  gave you an upvote nevertheless , 
  wuppertal of course hehe . 
  we 've just to transform the grid since it ca n't take the fluctuating input from renewables . 
  got to find solutions to store energy . 
  now we 're talking . 
  immigration is a huge topic in europe , it - is - european news , and i appreciate that you have not given up on `` educating '' your point of view . 
  i can understand your frustration with the examples you 've given , but it has to be discussed anyway . 
  we 're discussing in a downvoted thread , if all / r/europe people are not `` intelligent or mature '' ( kinda arrogant ) , why would i send replies to you in the first place ? 
  please just keep up posting your opinions . 
  well , you just claimed that the border control show is just about drug busting and did n't respond to the other campaign . 
  of course you do n't have to agree with everything your goverment does , it would be strange if you did n't , but on the other hand why is n't europe `` allowed '' to discuss the topic when your country takes the above mentioned stance towards immigration ? 
  [ it 's not just customs . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpbtpxhpkbe ) . 
  and with the other campaign in mind , yes . 
  that appears to be hypocritical of you . 
  well the show runs since 2004 ( 11 seasons ) and has spin-offs in the uk and canada . 
  bigot is the wrong term , my fault . 
  i meant hypocritical . 
  did n't australia fund a huge anti-immigration campaign `` no way - you will not make australia your home '' and in addition internationally broadcasts `` border security : australia 's front line '' which is a huge hit ? 
  i can see that you are feed up on the topic in some way , but it appears bigot also . 
  hang them . 
  dreamland, 
  [ norse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/middle-earth ) mythology ; `` german '' was n't even a term until cesar called everthing east of the rhine `` terra germania '' . 
  the cultural context from which tolkien draws his pictures is much older . 
  on behalf of the chinese : opium, 
  no need for anti-immigration policies , just show pictures of your lousy food , wheather and landscape . 
  middle-earth comes from old norse mythology . 
  you 're a buffer state like france was a buffer state during the cold war poland . 
  i can understand your paranoia nevertheless . 
  since both countries are manufacture-export oriented economies makes them natural allies , like opec . 
  china is pushing for a silkroad 2.0 spanning from shanghai to hamburg . 
  human rights will always take the backseat behind economic interests , espeacially when china always can bring up guantanamo and lately furgeson . 
  the common policy/interest manifest itself in industrial standards between the eu and china . 
  calling the relation between the eu/china `` the emergence of a new axis '' does n't sit well with me , since `` axis '' in the anglosphere usually is negavtily connotated . 
  do n't forget about the spice girls . 
  football, 
  so you are obvisiously one of `` them '' .
