  why talk when you can stare ? 
  just some nazis and transformers , nothing to worry about . 
  well , it seems like some people kind of get confused [ anyway ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31817445 `` germany '' ) . 
  i tend to believe that denmark , switzerland and to some extend norway get mixed up because of the similarity of flags . 
  same here with germany and belgium . 
  the little devil visits athens . 
  `` kalim\u00e9ra , i 'm the little devil and this is my little bucket . 
  i will steal everything you got . '', 
  `` you 're too late , they already took everything from us . 
  go to fuckin ' germany ! '', 
  so he travels to berlin . 
  `` guten tag , i 'm the little devil with the little bucket and i will steal all your stuff . '', 
  `` do whatever you want , everything is covered by insurance here . 
  why do n't you try it in poland ? '', 
  so he arrives in warsaw . 
  `` dobry dzien , i 'm the little devil and ... wait ... where the fuck is my bucket ?! '', 
  germany really interest least !, 
  economic talk already !, 
  reason war ? 
  idea different !, 
  situation -  opinion banks union ? 
  vote nothing !, 
  fact everyone bad actually !, 
  muhahaha, 
  best : tobias worst : horst, 
  russia is n't the bogeyman . 
  diplomatics finally succeded . 
  now let 's make a deal , and get back to normal . 
  you ca n't force a person to eat something , except you hold a gun up her sleeve . 
  she ate it , she was aware that she ate it , and complained afterwards . 
  you ca n't tell me that she was forced . 
  eating pork is perfectly normal in europe , if you ca n't do it , do n't be cook . 
  tasting the food you cook for others is perfecly normal , someone just could ' t integrate . 
  about time . 
  if you ca n't win yourself a mayorty in small districts , how can you govern a whole country ? 
  in germany we have both systems . 
  you have 2 votes , one for your local candidate , who the gets direcly elected into the parlament , the other for the party . 
  the party gets 50 % of its seats by the percentages from the 2nd vote , the other 50 % of the seats come from the direct mandates . 
  german ( wat willse ? ),
