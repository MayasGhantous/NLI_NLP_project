right , thanks !, 
  added , 
  what do you mean ? 
  did anything specific happen with them that i missed ? 
  added . 
  thanks !, 
   not letting in without-ticket people , who on porpouse worsen a public service ? 
  that 's not at all what this is about . 
  not letting in without-ticket people is okay , but they want to create a second bus line , and the segregation criterion is intended to be `` roma '' , not `` has no ticket '' . 
  ( a separate line for `` without-ticket '' would be pretty retarded . ), 
   it does excuse me if i know my point better than you do :p my point is : ** it 's wrong to discriminate an * entire people * based on the crimes of * individuals * . 
  ** it * does n't matter * how many individuals there are !, 
  apparently that did n't work : /  undeterred , the `` sheriff mayor '' mr gambino has vowed to push forward , noting that other solutions such as having municipal police on the bus have failed . 
   i read that as few exceptions to what was described , that most are rude and do what he says , not that those who are rude are exceptions . 
  does n't change my point . 
  for everyone else who 's confused : https://translate.google.com/#ro/en/toti%20tiganii%20sunt%20gunoi, 
  both your links seem to point only to a list of articles on the website ; for the first one , did you mean this ? 
  that 's not discrimination . 
  calling both things by the same term is ridiculous . 
  thanks !, 
  first of all , thank for translating !, 
  ^ ( could you perhaps include a link to the original comment ? ), 
  i think the following is the key part of the comment :  the problem with gypsies - not all of them , there 's exceptions and yet , they 're discriminating an * entire people * based on the crimes of * individuals * . 
  this is never okay . 
  i have no problem with banning individuals from public transit ( unfortunately , it 's not really feasible ) , but generalizing this to all of the roma is wrong . 
  wikipedia , [ apartheid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=apartheid&amp;oldid=630704934 ) , end of first paragraph :  by extension , the term is nowadays currently used for every kind of segregation , established by the state authority in a country , against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens , due to ethnic prejudices . 
  this fits the definition pretty well . 
  also , note that the term was n't introduced by journalists :  on saturday , spinelli was rebuked by his party head nichi vendola . 
  giving people different rights was called `` apartheid '' , he told the paper `` la stampa '' . 
  ( translated myself from the welt.de article . ), 
  after that , the term was even used by a defender of the proposal :  writing in the italian daily la stampa , editorialist massimo gramellini defended the mayor 's approach , calling it `` apartheid not linked to racial prejudices but rather illegal behaviour . '',

  ** germany ** - in thuringia , coalition negotiations are about to begin between the lefts , the social democrats , and the greens ( red-red-green ) . \u00b9 the interesting thing about this is that it 's the first time the left will set the prime minister of a federal state . 
  there 's also been some discussion about the relation between the left and the sed ( socialist unity party of germany , the gdr party ) , and apparently they initially refused calling the gdr an `` unjust state '' ( unrechtsstaat , opposite of rechtsstaat `` constitutional state '' ) . 
  i do n't know too much about that though -- fellow germans , feel free to correct me !, 
  - 2014-10-26 13:00 cest edit : some more info : at the moment , the only coalition feasible on federal level is the current grand coalition . 
  in last year 's federal election , red-red-green would also have had a majority ( in current polls the afd prevents that ) , but this possibility was rejected mainly by the spd , arguing that the left was too unstable and fragmented to be a reliable coalition partner . 
  so the fact that a red-red-green coalition is now considered in one state also influences federal politics . 
  - angela merkel bitch-slapped david cameron twice : - on the adjustments / extra payments : cameron -- `` i wo n't pay that '' ; merkel -- `` yes you will ''  this did not come out of the blue . 
  i understand that it 's difficult to come up with $ 2 billion , david , but this should have been expected ( [ source ] ( http://rt.com/uk/199296-uk-europe-bill-demand/ ) )  these are normal adjustment procedures , which [ ... ] this year [ ... ] for some countries turned out to be exceptionally high . 
  [ ... ] we do not doubt the correctness of these results . 
  the cause for these peaks must be explained [ ... ] but then the finance ministers must consider how to solve this [ ... ] . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.bundesregierung.de/content/de/mitschrift/pressekonferenzen/2014/10/2014-10-24-statement-merkel-bruessel.html ) , translation by myself ) - on migration reform : cameron apparently wanted to `` cap the number of low-skilled migrants seeking work in the united kingdom '' , merkel :  germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the eu ( [ source ] ( http://www.dw.de/merkel-deals-blow-to-britains-cameron-on-migration-reform/a-18021585 ) ) - 2014-10-27 18:00 edit : there was some discussion about the federal system , and if we really need all 16 states : annegret kramp-karrenbauer ( christian democrats , apparently considered merkel 's `` crown princess '' ) suggested that perhaps it could be reduced to 6-8 states . 
  most other politicians did n't like that , especially horst seehofer ( christian socials -- the csu is basically the bavarian cdu ) . 
  unfortunately i do n't have a good english link for that ; there 's [ this editorial ] ( http://www.dw.de/opinion-german-federalism-can-also-take-a-different-form/a-18021494 ) , and then german articles about [ the suggestion ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-sechs-oder-acht-bundeslaender-a-998987.html ) and ( two days later ) [ the rebukes ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/laenderfusionen-seehofer-weist-drohung-aus-dem-saarland-zurueck-a-999249.html ) . 
  thanks / u/or4ngest4r for [ reminding me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kcjae/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_26102014/cll66fj ) !, 
  - i do n't remember anything else right now , i 'll update if someone comments . 
  \u00b9 we have amazingly creative party names , do n't we ? 
  they 're literally called the left , the social democratic party of germany , and ( alliance '90 / ) the greens . 
  2014-10-29 19:45 cet edit : and die partei of course , literally `` the party '' . 
  thanks / u/weltburger for reminding me !, 
  they do it like this in german news as well -- voiceover , but with the original track in the background . 
  the voiceover is usually faster ( i assume it 's because the voiceover is reading a prepared translation while the original speaker is speaking freely ) , so it pauses every now and then . 
  ( it usually also starts a bit later . ), 
  how do they treat quotes in news in other countries ? 
  there 's a huge debate on the [ wikipedia discussion page for recursion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk:recursion#recursion_link_in_.22see_also.22 ) about whether the `` see also '' section should link to itself or not . 
  til [ spa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spa,_belgium ) exists ... but :  though other sources of healing mineral springs have become famous throughout the world , it is the town of spa which has become eponymous with any place having a natural water source that is believed to possess special health-giving properties , as a * spa * . 
  in this case , the term comes from the city , not the other way around . 
  til bath is literally named bath because of its , well , baths . 
  thanks , i added it . 
  ** germany ** - turkish citizens living in germany could vote for the turkish president from jul 31 to aug 3 . 
  ( technically last week , but there was no comment for germany in last week 's post . ), 
  in turkey , the election takes place today . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.dw.de/turkish-voters-go-to-the-polls-in-germany/a-17823575 ) - sigmar gabriel ( vice chancellor , minister of economy + energy ) withdrew goverment approval for a major defense deal between rheinmetall and russia -- about 100 million $ for a combat training center . 
  ( the deal had already been put on hold in march . ), 
  [ source ] ( http://www.dw.de/germany-cancels-major-defense-deal-with-russia/a-17830072 ) - der spiegel reports that the foreign ministry has asked all embassies in germany to name their secret service personell in germany -- in short , `` could you please tell us who you 've got spying on us ? '' [ source ] ( http://www.dw.de/spiegel-germany-asks-other-countries-to-name-their-spies/a-17842641 ) - drunk finnish guy decided to go for a swim in the trave and it took the police and firemen an hour to convince him to come out of the water .

  [ source ] ( http://www.hl-live.de/aktuell/textstart.php?id=93099 ) -- thanks / u/imliterallydyinghere - does n't feel like much else happened , but i probably forgot something . 
  will update if you remind me of things in the comments . 
   much of the new legislation zipping across duma deputies ' desks has been authored by the kremlin and aims to extend and deepen a crackdown , begun shortly after vladimir putin returned to the kremlin two years ago . 
  russia ** has already passed ** laws * to discourage dissent , limit internet freedom , curb civil society , intimidate anyone who consorts with foreigners , and criminalize any public expression of gay identity * . 
  ( emphasis mine ) these new laws are not the ones that `` discourage dissent [ ... ] and criminalize any public expression of gay identity '' -- they 've already had those . 
  ** germany ** * two weeks ago , a caver got severely injured ( concussion ) around 1000m deep into the riesending-h\u00f6hle ( `` giant thing cave '' ) . 
  his rescue was on and off the news since then ; they reached the surface on thursday . 
  [ german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rettungsaktion_in_der_riesending-schachth%c3%b6hle ) , [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.de/cave-researcher-johann-westhauser-rescued-from-riesending-cave-system/a-17720442 ) ( in english ) * conflicts within the grand coalition ( spd , socialist , and cdu , conservative ) because of the next european commission president . 
  both parties now support juncker , so the question arises what 's to happen with spd candidate schulz . 
  some suggested he might become commissioner , but then the current german commissioner , oettinger ( energy ) , would have to leave ; since he 's from the cdu , they do n't like that at all ( the cdu won the elections , why should they have to give up their commissioner ? ) . 
  [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.de/european-social-democrats-back-junckers-candidacy-for-commission-president/a-17726838 ) * world cup * an american exchange student got [ stuck in a giant stone vagina ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2014/06/22/student-gets-stuck-inside-giant-stone-vagina-4771752/ ) .

  thanks / u/omnilatent ( [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28sfwj/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_22062014/ciet483 ) ) !, 
  that 's all i can remember right now : / if i forgot something , reply and i 'll try to edit asap, 
  i prefer [ this version ] ( http://www.kotzendes-einhorn.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/rittersport-mett.png ) : `` new !, 
  for reasons . '', 
  wow , the greens completely * vanished * from the news post-election . 
  well , in german it 's just a billion euros , so we got that going for us . 
   the politician edathy is revealed to be a customer of borderline cp from a canadian website . 
  while the material is in bad taste ( pictures of posing young boys , naked ) , it alone is probably not enough for a valid accusation . 
  ... which may now change . 
  multiple groups have demanded a change of the legislation to make this illegal as well , and the federal minister of justice , heiko maas ( spd ) , is considering fiercer cp laws ( [ german source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/edathy-affaere-maas-erwaegt-schaerfere-gesetze-gegen-kinderpornografie-a-954216.html ) , was n't able to find an english one ) . 
  thanks , that 's very interesting !, 
  originally yes , see edit, 
  nazis , see edit, 
  `` dying help '' , see edit, 
  `` dying help '' , see edit, 
  does english really not have a better word for that than `` euthanasia '' ? 
  edit : apparently not . 
  in german , there 's `` sterbehilfe '' -- `` dying help '' -- because `` euthanasie '' is connected with hitler and all that shit , so i was a bit taken aback by that title ; in germany that would probably be a huge issue if you titled `` euthanasie bei kindern '' instead of `` sterbehilfe f\u00fcr kinder '' . 
  i recently watched [ fermat 's room ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fermat%27s_room ) ( la habitaci\u00f3n de fermat ) . 
  my mother said i would probably enjoy it because of the mathematical puzzles . 
  it was a pretty nice movie overall , i thought .
