  i can think that a language is easy without being perfect in it . 
  most of the there / their / they 're mistakes i see are made by native speakers . 
  natives have their own set of mistakes , slips of the pen that happen because they do n't have to think about certain language elements , while even an experienced non native speaker does . 
  doggerland will rise again !, 
   sounds like your typical shitty school ~ ~ in poland ~ ~ . 
  ftfy, 
  this puts him at the same level of evility as alan rickman 's sheriff of nottingham . 
  they said ` friendly ' . 
  per capita is only important if it is in our favor . 
  it must be cringy to listen to him in translation . 
  but i assure you that `` nein ? '', 
  `` ooh ! '', 
  was as funny for us as `` non ? '', 
  `` ooh ! '', 
  for any french . 
   so i have met a whole lot bunch of teachers completely unable to pronounce the ` r ' at the end of germanic surnames in many areas of germany people omit the ending - r , too . 
  so mr. m\u00fcller is pronounced 'm \u00fclla ' , 'm \u00fcllea ' or 'm \u00fcller ' with a very weak r , even on national television .

  scots are adorable drunks though - at least that 's how most of your football fans represent you in my experience . 
  i know - i may be a minority on this . 
  but i had to handle drunk football fans from many different nations , and i ca n't remember a scot who was a real asshole . 
  obnoxious , yes ( * ) - but also somehow adorable . 
  ( * ) guys , the first time that 12 of you waited in my ambulance car and shouted `` surprise ! '', 
  when i opened the door was funny . 
  after that , it became a bit annoying . 
  it sounds as if they indeed meant `` booooring here '' . 
  i think you got it right . 
  was it a town in south germany ? 
  they often have idioms different from my place . 
  i do n't know it in this way , but ~ ~ germany ~ ~ the german sprachraum is big . 
  maybe this is a use , too . 
  wiktionary only knows it as `` here is the source of our problem '' `` nothing exciting going on over there '' - i would say `` da m\u00f6chte _ ich _ nicht begraben sein '' ( i do n't want to be buried there ) , `` da m\u00f6chte ich nicht tot \u00fcber dem zaun h\u00e4ngen '' ( i do n't want to hang across the fence dead there ) , or `` wo sich fuchs und hase gute nacht sagen '' ( where fox and hare say good night to each other ) , or , `` da haben sie 1980 ihre letzte hexe verbrannt '' ( they burnt their last witch in 1980 , about a rural / redneck place ), 
  you have a polite way to tell somebody to kill himself - that is pratchett material . 
  in german `` here lies the dog buried '' means ` this is the essential point . ', 
  edit : better : this is the core of our problem, 
  [ to be fair , they used star wars ' imperial march as marching song , so it 's all good . 
  ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/world/asia/taiwan-nazi-hitler-parade.html ), 
  it would n't bug me because they just seem to be jokes about language or quotations . 
  they do n't belittle the victims or glorify the ns . 
  [ the ns high school parade in taiwan ] ( http://m.journal-neo.org/2016/12/31/taiwan-ignorance-danger-of-war-and-a-high-school-nazi-parade/ ) on the other hand would be the moment when i shift into berserk mode . 
  everybody is allowed to be ignorant about what happened on the other side of the world , but when you put that much effort into uniforms and paper tanks , you show that you have spent time informing yourself . 
  and decided to treat the shoa and the war crimes as a giant joke . 
  but a quip about a raincoat - no problem . 
  i learned that the hard way when i tried to buy some eggs in nev\u015fehir , before the age of smartphones . 
  i am sure he understood my pantomime but had just too much fun to admit it . 
  it seems to me that trump 's election was kind of a wake-up call for many moderate germans . 
  in the past decades , we were sure that we had a friend and ally in the usa . 
  even when there was dissent and protest , like the decision not to take part in the iraq war , it was more like a family quarrel to us . 
  the nsa spies on our chancellor - not nice , but that 's what bigger brothers do . 
  this certainty has been smashed . 
  and so the idea that we need a stable eu , because we are not protected by the pax americana any longer , becomes more important again . 
  but the far right is against the idea of a strong eu . 
  so it seems to me ( and at the moment it is only a feeling without much evidence ) , that trump 's triumph has a paradox effect on our populist right . 
  it 's ` nuclear ' . 
  thanks . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  i asked because your question sounds as if you think that the rise of right-wing populism is a western europe phenomenon . 
  so you are asking if poland and hungary are concerned about the right-wing movement in the netherlands and france ? 
  no offence to the mentioned countries , but - really ? 
  well , there is humor that i really like - like ` kottan ermittelt ' , which was great - and there is this kind of humor where somebody kicks the crutches of a child with a broken leg . 
  i admit that it is difficult for me to understand the charme of the second type . 
  you did n't answer my question . 
  aand here we go again . 
  it was told that this law exissts in germany . 
  so it might be that it does n't sound that medieval to us . 
  so why was his post unpolite ? 
  not obscure , but i find it funny : \u00a7 328 of the german strafgesetzbuch says that you will be sentenced to up to 5 years in prison _ or a fine _ if you cause a ~ ~ thermo ~ ~ nuclear explosion . 
  you get a short article in your paper and a short clip on the news . 
  that 's it , basically , concerning these polls . 
  it is nothing like the usian 18-months long sitcom . 
  great presidents and science communicators . 
  they seem to have big hands , as usual gloves are too small for them . 
  sometimes they eat ears . 
  it has become internet custom to admire soldiers like jack churchill and audie murphy as badasses because of their kills - even if pilecki had not killed one man , he would still have been one of the finest men whoever had to go to war . 
  uk : winston churchill . 
  yes , he was an imperialist . 
  and his decisions were sometimes reckless , not only in ww2 . 
  but i doubt that the uk would have been as resilient as they were if he had not been prime minister . 
  we had voting machines for a short time , but are back to pencil and paper . 
  the poll workers count the votes locally ; it is made sure that every bigger party and if possible some of the smaller ones have provided a poll worker . 
  it seems to work , so i feel better with this than with any machine . 
  it 's a pr-stunt . 
  everybody thinks we have great engineers but no sense of humor . 
  the airport should change that clich\u00e9 . 
  if i am at a train i usually stare at my phone . 
  in the pre-mobile age i used to read . 
  do they know witold pilecki ? 
  he has been a personal hero of mine since i was 14 , but no pole i have yet met knew him . 
  hint : the buddenbrooks-haus is a museum in l\u00fcbeck . 
  edit - ah . 
  too slow . 
   max and moritz wilhelm busch was born in the schaumburger land , today a part of lower saxony . 
  it was never a part of prussia . 
  he lived in munich for some time , but never in eastern prussia . 
  some of his characters speak the lower german of his place of birth , there is nothing resembling ostpreu\u00dfisch in his stories . 
  the karneval crazies ? 
  deal . 
  the ruhr area dutch ? 
  that is a first for me . 
  you had the stift essen , a clerical area , dortmund as a reichsstadt that did n't belong to any noble leech , and the eastern part which was territory of the grafschaft mark .
