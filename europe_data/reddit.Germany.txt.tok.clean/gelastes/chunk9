  it feels weird . 
  this one is quite irrational , of course , but i ca n't help myself of feeling weird using a bidet . 
  i am sure that it will be a no-brainer for the next generation . 
   why would you stand to pee when at home ? 
  ~ ~ because you have to clean the floor yourself . ~ ~ edit : wrong universe, 
  keep in mind that the continental europeans who are too uneducated to speak a foreign language do n't post here . 
  the average american on reddit has to be less educated than the average european , because the europeans are filtered . 
  that 's what we have porsches for . 
  both grandfathers were soldiers in ww2 , one was unlucky enough to be a soldier in ww1 , too . 
  the other one was pow in a mine in the ural . 
  they did not like to talk about it . 
  great-grandfather and two uncles were killed on their trek from east prussia . 
  they did n't either , but fortunately they were quick learners . 
  just imagine a students ' meeting in a cheap restaurant in germany , 20 people having a good time , when suddenly the american expat shouts over their heads and addresses his buddy at the register . 
  there are americans for whom `` do n't be such a jew '' is just friendly banter . 
  i , well , was n't speaking about a hypothetical case . 
   to build a turk , has nothing to do with actual turks but with the mechanical turk : that 's why i wrote , `` from a certain event '' . 
  the etymology is not clear . 
  the internet says it is derived from `` the turk '' . 
  kluges etymologisches w\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen sprache speculates that it may be connected to the french `` t\u00eate de turc '' or with military jargon of the prussian army , who allegedly called a surprise during a parade or a maneuver `` einen t\u00fcrken bauen '' . 
  if you know more than kluge , please provide something else than wikipedia . 
  `` ich bin mit meinem latein am ende '' , i am at the end of my latin - i have no idea how we could solve this problem . 
  `` die englische krankheit '' , the english disease - rachitis ( obsolete , i think . 
  heard it from my grandparents and read it in older books ) `` die franz\u00f6sische krankheit '' , the french disease - syphilis `` die holl\u00e4ndische krankheit '' , the dutch disease , being unable to qualify for the european championship ( ok - i just made up this one ) `` das ist get\u00fcrkt '' , this is turkified , used when something is ( or seems to be ) forged / faked / falsified . 
  the etymological dictionaries do n't have a conclusive explanation on this one , but they are sure that it derived from a certain event , not from the idea that turks fake more than the rest of europe . 
  edit : forgot about sex . 
  `` es franz\u00f6sisch machen '' , doing it french : oral sex . 
  doing it greek : anal . 
  there are lists with more nationalities to be found in the net , but i think these two are the only ones widely used . 
  i have never heard a grown-up saying it , and i definitely never heard it in my youth ( 80s ) . 
  but yeah , kids say it in the school yard here in the ruhrgebiet . 
  edit : if you are learning german : do n't use jew as a slur . 
  ever . 
  there are few things that will get you immediate hostility while you are speaking german as a non-native speaker , but this is one of them . 
  if it is not a biggy to say `` do n't be such a jew '' in your language , it kind of is a biggy in german . 
  for me , it 's not about the price . 
  it is about having more control about the car . 
  that does n't make sense for the average drive , but when was driving ever about being rational ? 
  no worries . 
  i just trolled you a bit . 
  i am drunk . 
   funny german !, 
  / s i did n't try to be funny , but now i am curious : why am i not funny ? 
  awesome !, 
  it looks like a game where you have to be savvy in using very precisely dosed brutality to foul somebody without breaking bones . 
  same in germany , exceptions only for tiny shops where you are given out the products ( kiosk ) , petrol stations and shops in railway stations / airports . 
  on easter even many of those are closed . 
  sundays are quiet , you ca n't shop and that is great . 
  legal in germany as long as you do n't sell it . 
  the term reenactment is used in germany , too . 
  the replay of the hussite wars battle sounds like reenactment . 
  the mittelalterm\u00e4rkte are not considered reenactment , because they are not authentic enough - they are just a gathering with a medieval theme , although there may be reenactment groups mingling with others . 
  most reenactment groups that i know ( or heard of ) are very thorough in being as authentic as possible , concerning their stuff . 
  so many members consider mittelalterm\u00e4rkte an abomination . 
  others love them . 
  most russians i have met i met on my jobs . 
  so my experience is somewhat restricted to certain parts of the russian immigrants here in germany . 
  my experience : mostly great people . 
  their way of thinking and their humor sometimes closely related to mine , sometimes stranger than what i experienced in countries in remote parts of the world . 
  if they seem shallow , there is a good chance that their line of thoughts is way ahead of yours , but they do n't bother to share it with you . 
  or they are shallow . 
  never , ever screw them . 
  situations i had with russians as a paramedic / medical assistant while working in a walk-in medical care center for drug users : number one : the patient had a deep , infected wound in his groin that i had to clean . 
  deep means i had to be careful around the visible sinews . 
  unfortunately for him , he was sober , so he had not taken anything that would have dulled the pain . 
  after i had done things that had let me wince just because i had to do them while he just silently stared at the ceiling , i finally said : `` does n't this hurt ? '', 
  he looked at me : `` of course it hurts . 
  it is like hell . '', 
  `` i just thought ... because i do n't hear anything from you ... '' `` would it hurt less if i cried ? '', 
  `` so no use crying . 
  but it would be good if you make quick work . 
  i do n't know if i will pass out . '', 
  number two : two young men , man1 and man2 , are sitting on a bench together , sharing a bag of nuts . 
  i : `` hi ... uhm ... you two are good ? '', 
  man1 : `` of course , sani . 
  why you ask ? '', 
  i : `` i heard that man2 , well , kind of ... stabbed you last week ? '', 
  man1 : `` yes . 
  i was in hospital . 
  it was quite a stab . '', 
  i : `` but now you are sitting together . 
  that 's fine . 
  uhm - so there wo n't be any trouble ? '', 
  man1 : `` no . 
  why should there be trouble ? '', 
  i : `` because he stabbed you ? '', 
  man1 : `` i tried to sell him crap . 
  so he stabbed me . 
  that was business . 
  now we do n't do business anymore . 
  you want nuts ? '', 
  edit : word, 
  i think you mean bse , which should n't be in haggis because haggis is made of sheep . 
  the disease caused by prions in sheep is called scrapie . 
  the ban seems to be because of sheep lungs . 
   nutella is n't as exotic in europe . 
  it 's italian . 
  i am quite new around here , i will do what the majority does , so that i can feel like a part of a tight knit group , which always makes me feel warm and fuzzy . 
  but would n't it be possible to just answer in a factual , i.e. 
  boring way ?
