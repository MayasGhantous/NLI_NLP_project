i think it is more about having some of the brexiteers in the government , while the brexit , because otherwise they 'd just claim that may etc. 
  did n't get the best deal possible . 
  and considering the `` deal '' the brexiteers promoted during their campaign was never even considered by any eu leader , but just some crap they claimed to get votes , they would always claim it was mays fault , the brexit turned out a desaster . 
  so , i do n't feel like appointing johnson in itself is a provocation , but it is very likely he will provoke some foreign heads of state etc. 
  you got it . 
  we want neither of those here . 
  so , any ideas ? 
  he 's your buddy , guy . 
  since they have dual citizenship , it is actually possible to revoke the dutch one and deport them . 
  being born in a country does n't grant citizenship btw . 
  so that 's not really a point . 
   thanks , i 'll check this study out . 
  although , i have to admit that a source called `` glass door '' might be a bit partisan . 
  it does n't seem to be perfect , but it shows that there is no pay gap of ~ 20 % for the same work , which is often claimed and complete bs . 
   it 's true that some sectors are more `` man-heavy '' , while others are more `` woman heavy '' , and that this is a major control fact is this debate . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you want to say , but it seems to be neither the topic of the article nor of this thread nor your source . 
  this also does n't proof some kind of oppression . 
  it only proofs that men and women tend to choose different professions , but does n't show why . 
  i think it 's save to assume , that at least part of it is through different socializing , but it 's not even clear who is the winner here , because many men seem to put high value on income when choosing a profession but wont be happy in their job later . 
  by `` borat factor '' you mean sexism ? 
  that is definitely a possibility , but just because it is possible does n't mean it is true . 
  and since most studies seem to be biased one way or the other it 's kinda hard to come up with something useful . 
  none of the tables really includes the `` same work '' , which is the whole point to be made here . 
  the best they came up with is a field of work , but you ca n't really claim that everyone in the field of , for example , `` professional , scientific and technical activities '' should earn the same , because this does n't even include differences like the actual field of profession , are they programmers , doctors or what ? . 
  there is also no mentioning of their education , so even if they only compared people from the health sector , there would still be a huge amount of different jobs . 
  so all you achieve by posting this , is making it easy for your adversaries to contradict you.if you are really trying to make a point here , i 'd recommend you to not use studies like this one . 
  you ca n't really draw any conclusions from it because of the massive flaws . 
  for example [ this ] ( https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/gender-pay-gap/ ) study , u/10ebbor10 posted itt , should show you that yours is not really useful , thus wo n't often lead to an actual debate about the topic , it will change the topic to the flaws of the study . 
  well i never said russia did nothing wrong , i do n't think the whole nato/russia relations have a good guy and a bad guy . 
  it 's basically two assholes trying to smear shit at each other , but they are actually both full of shit . 
  that does n't change the fact , that i think this article does n't make much sense . 
  maybe russia should n't have settled right in the middle of all those nato bases then !, 
  / s it 's really ridiculous to feel threatened , because the bases you build right in front of your enemy are in range of their weapons . 
  well there is a lot of confusion , because people fleeing from a war torn country are not given refugee status in general , they are only allowed to stay till the war is over . 
  while `` real '' refugees are prosecuted by the government or another large group in their home country , thus they are allowed to stay forever . 
  so unless the war takes a really long time , they will most likely get deported once it 's over . 
  we also call it `` nadelbaum '' . 
  not sure what you mean by `` semmel vs brtchen '' thing , but its just the tip of the iceberg : http://www.zeit.de/lebensart/2013-01/d-karte-04/d-karte-04-thickbox.jpg austria is not on the map though . 
  is it also semmel area ? 
  you are right , there is an error . 
  fun fact . 
  enamel is called email in german . 
  what kind of touristes do they expect to come , when the place is filled with bars and stuff that is designed around getting people drunk . 
  just because they put off their customers , wo n't make families or what ever they want come there . 
  they do n't specifically say , but it seems to be only in germany . 
   anyways , the negociations will fail as soon as theresa may refuse to pay the bill , which should happens pretty soon after june 's election . 
  i think that is very unlikely . 
  the `` bill '' is not really a bill it 's just a summary of what the uk * might * be obligated to pay . 
  parts of it do n't make much sense , but other parts definitely have to be payed , and that is what negotiations are for . 
  in the end both sides will declare themselves the victor , the uk because they only have to pay part of the `` bill '' and the eu because they made the uk pay . 
  well they never got rid of windows completely and they also announced to [ go back to only windows . 
  ] ( https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/aus-fuer-limux-muenchner-stadtrat-sagt-zum-pinguin-leise-servus-3626623.html ) it seems to be a stupid decision , though . 
   like the eu blocking the uk from making trade deals that wo n't come into effect until after the uk leaves i guess ? 
  well first of all the eu is not a member of the eu , thus not object of art. 7 . 
  also the eu does n't block anything . 
  the treaties , the uk has contracted with the other members of the eu , forbid the contracting parties to arrange those deals on their own . 
  no one could prevent you from negotiating though . 
   also , a2 is about human rights . 
  true . 
  but it also contains solidarity . 
   solidarity ... is quite vague . 
  i 'm not sure what the intention of this was . 
  the only thing under art. 2 possibly violated here is the solidarity part , and that is because it is quite vague . 
  i 'm not sure what the intention of this was . 
  the argument could be made that it is not very solidary to block something , you wo n't be part of . 
  i said :  a single violation probably does n't qualify for sanctions . 
  that does n't mean there is a violation . 
  it means that , even if this act is considered a violation of art. 2 , i expect this to not be sufficient for sanctions . 
  it is possible , under art. 7 of eu treaty , to suspend rights ( including voting rights ) of a member , for violating art. 2 , which is mostly about human rights etc. , but also contains solidarity . 
  unanimity would be necessary . 
  it might be possible if the uk keeps doing things like that , but a single violation probably does n't qualify for sanctions . 
   pull another one . 
  since when the whole maltese company register of maltese registered companies becomes foreign , offshore and german ? 
  is it me or does n't this make any sense ? 
  ( i 'm not entirely sure whats going on here , seems to be a bit bugged so i 'm just gon na quote myself here . ), 
   [ graph ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/nqxq7rv ) with similar topic , and the corresponding [ study ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf ) ( afaik the graph itself is not part of the study but uses it 's data ) . 
  someone asked for a similar study about christians and i found [ this ] ( https://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/2014/vi14-101.pdf ) , comparing christians and muslims in europe , containing [ this graph ] ( https://mediendienst-integration.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_bildschirmfoto_2015-06-26_um_19.01.39_b219814e37.png ) ( the bars say `` do n't want homosexual friends '' , `` jews can not be trusted '' , `` west/muslims are out to destroy '' and `` agree to all 3 '' ( the study is in english ) ) . 
  just claim you only know it from south park . 
  like me , because i totally had no idea what that was before . 
  i swear . 
  not . 
  the . 
  slightest . 
  clue . 
  [ relevant dr. who ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwjtaak76ze ), 
  but the merkel cover was created by good and noble greek citizens , while the focus cover was fabricated by vicious nazies !, 
  / s i also do n't see the problem with the bild `` articles '' . 
  the first one claims there are protests against a proposed law . 
  second one claims someone went to prison for shooting a greek . 
  i do n't see anything `` defamatory '' or `` borderline racist '' here . 
  this is something too often forgotten . 
  even if there were no complications and it were to provide actual benefits , operation trauma is definitely harmful to an infants development . 
  some recover better than others , but its overall just an impediment . 
  i guess you are right , it is very likely to have an impact on society when all males grow up with a trauma . 
  the us seems to fit in there aswell . 
  `` taking account of the framework for its future relationship '' is a bit vague do n't you think ? 
  the argument could be made that , since the uk is not going to join the eea , the framework is allready set . 
  also , the framework is not only about economy . 
  i 'd say it is directed mostly at things that are connected to eu , but do n't necessitate eu membership , like schengen ( not in this case obviously ) . 
  '' / s indicates the presence of sarcasm . '',
