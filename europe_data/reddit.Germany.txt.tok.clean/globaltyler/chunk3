  well , ** hamburg ** is the most similar to berlin as it is also a city state , which gives it a certain degree of political freedom which usually is something only found in a nation 's capital . 
  addition the major port and huge economic hub . 
  ** frankfurt ** is the smallest one but it is historically the closest germany has to a second city , because it is almost like a former capital . 
  the german kaiser was usually elected here during the era of the holy roman empire . 
  the `` bundestag '' was there after napoleon and the first german parliament was there during the 1848 revolution . 
  it almost became capital of western germany if adenauer had n't been so lazy ( the story goes that he neither wanted to move from his house nor to commute to a place that far away that 's why bonn got the gig ) . 
  plus german finance capital and major german airport and economic hub . 
  ** munich ** is probably the second city for actual political power . 
  not because of munich per se but because of the bavarian * special * conservative party with their special rights . 
  it is also the only second city that was a capital of a sovereign state at one point ( hamburg and frankfurt were only free cities ) . 
  plus of course major economic hub , major airport and wies ` n. 
  i think we actually have the `` first world problem '' of having too many second cities :d, 
  does that mean we 'll get more brazilian players on european servers ? 
  i hue not :d, 
  goodbye lenins ... 
  you mean erecting barriers inside london with signs `` you are leaving the democratic sector of the uk '' ? 
   i am shocked you think german english is mediocre . 
  a lot of them are . 
  especially from former east germany because there for older generations the focus was on russian and for younger generations , well the western states sent teachers ( as well as other government and administration workers ) but quite often it 's not the best people that go but rather the ones you 'd like to get rid of ( especially if you keep in mind that teachers and lots of government workers ca n't be fired ) . 
  i am not saying every german has a mediocre level of english . 
  there are heaps of people who are really interested , work hard and would ( save for the accent ) probably be taken for native speakers . 
  with the internet giving you the possibility to watch original movies and tv shows instead of cheap copies in german and lagging 2 years behind for tv shows , people are improving . 
  but most people could n't even watch an easy film in english with english subtitles . 
  just remember , the slogan the douglas perfume shop chain had once `` come in and find out '' ( yes , a german chain had an english slogan for their german shops ) was misunderstood as `` come in and then try to find your way out again . '', 
  ( or `` come in , but then go back out again . '' ), 
  by i think 70 % of the people they asked . 
  cringeworthy in terms of the type of language she uses , it 's full of bloodless vocabulary , dull abstract metaphors and just completely passive unengaged speech in general . 
  she likes words like `` alternativlos '' ( without any alternative ) , that 's how she usually describes her policies . 
  she also likes to use `` als '' ( as / than ) in her sentences . 
  ( we as a federal republic will not supply weapons ) . 
  as an export nation we might ? 
  or why the `` as '' in there ? 
  about the nsa scandal : `` wir als deutsche haben viele informationen bekommen '' ( we as germans received a lot of information ) . 
  as germans ? 
  so it means i ( as a german ) can receive them as well ? 
  or why the `` as '' ? 
  she also likes to express her `` fullest confidence '' in politicians . 
  that usually means that they 'll resign within the fortnight . 
  there 's jokes about what has received the `` fullest confidence '' ( the euro , the eu , several companies , government organisations ) and how long it 'll be till they 're gone . 
  we do n't set switches upwards , not even in this metaphorical sense , they are `` set differently '' if you want to indicate a change in policy , but not upwards . 
  as for the english , well let 's just say i 've heard too many german politicians try it and fail , so my expectations are really low . 
  last one was former foreign minister guido westerwelle . 
  and until i hear her speak english i am more inclined to think that she is not an exception from the mediocre level of english in germany . 
  i really do n't want to hear her speak english - what she says is cringeworthy enough , hearing it in east german `` english '' would only make it worse . 
  at least the speech will be written for her , so it should not contain a lot of `` german grammar and english words plus false friends '' sentences ... ... 
  i hope . 
   the poor , corrupt , unsound countries will outnumber the non corrupt rich ones . 
  we have non corrupt countries ? 
  [ wei\u00dfwurst ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weisswurst ) itself is n't scary but the way you eat it ( you do n't eat the skin , so you somehow have to get the inner part out ) is definitely strange . 
  the `` zuzzeln '' as the traditional way is ... erm ... weird . 
  i usually just cut them in half and roll the meat out of the skin . 
  [ mett or mettbr\u00f6tchen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mett ) is something that i find really gross . 
  i really do n't know who invented that stuff , you 're supposed to fry the minced meat , not eat it raw with raw onions ... dunno if there 's some german food that 's really scary . 
  maybe labskaus ... 
  same for me in australia with vegemite . 
  was in a hostel with free breakfast and there stood vegemite not even in the jar but on a small plate like the jams . 
  i took a roll and spread the vegemite on there like i 'd do it with nutella . 
  baaaaaaaaad choice . 
  only after i met some aussies who gave me the proper manual could i start eating and appreciating it . 
  i like it with cheese or avocado . 
  some cdu guy also called for [ `` german algorithms '' ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.golem.de%2fnews%2fnsa-affaere-cdu-fordert-deutsche-algorithmen-zur-verschluesselung-1402-104584.html&amp;act=url ) what they really want is that instead of nsa bullying us companies to collaborate with them to get backdoors into everyone 's data , it should be their `` intelligence '' services that bully companies in their countries to collaborate with them . 
  spd and cdu also are preventing a parliamentary investigation into the snowden files because the other parties want to include german `` intelligence '' services . 
  it 's not the fact that this spying robs us of all our privacy and endangers all freedom and democracy that bothers them . 
  it 's the fact that they did n't do it themselves . 
  bloody liars the whole lot of them . 
  no time for polandball , just w\u00f6rk . 
  probably romanticism artists . 
  [ caspar david friedrich - the wanderer above the sea of fog ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog ) is defo one of the more popular ones . 
  the first picture with all the piled up rubbish next to the house reminded me of a picture i took while in cambodia . 
  it was during a rest stop at a restaurant on the bus from phnom penh to sihanoukville and i went for a piss and the male toilets were at the very end of the property , the urinals were just open air and behind you was the fence and the cambodians had just thrown the rubbish over the fence . 
  but - it was less rubbish than in the picture of lunik ix ( which says something since it was a really busy rest stop ) . 
  and the cambodians , even though they had not really realized that you should n't just dump your rubbish everywhere , they at least had the common sense to throw it over the fence . 
  [ broilers - meine sache ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kysidj7nz4 ) ( same band and also quite good : [ wie weit wir gehen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-i8okc0-ge ) or [ tanzt du noch einmal mit mir ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwngz-io7ma ) ) [ neonschwarz - on a journey ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nguro4g5tm8 ) chorus is english but the rest of the lyrics are german . 
  and a classic : [ rio reiser - k\u00f6nig von deutschland ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m48knkvavse ) ( 1994 version ) . 
  could n't find junimond in a non-blocked version , that 's my favourite of him . 
  problem is that heaps of germans take that wad of coloured toilet paper seriously ... 
  i was surprised quite a few times . 
  before i went to australia , my accent was typical german so you could hear from a mile away where i was from . 
  and since it was cheaper to fly to london and take a flight from there than take a flight directly from germany , i stayed there a few days . 
  went shopping and i remember one shopping assistant just switching to nearly flawless german after i told her what i was looking for . 
  i was so stunned i did n't even think of complimenting her on her fluency or ask her how she became fluent . 
  i met a guy in a hostel in gold coast and when i saw him first , he was talking to a german girl who was cleaning for accommodation and it took me around 2 minutes to realize that he was n't also a german . 
  turned out he was from brighton and had studied in my uni town for a couple of semesters . 
  i also met people from the uk who were quite fluent in french or spanish . 
  but the reason i remember them ( except for the shopping assistant most of them even by name ) is that they were the exception . 
  normally all the brits admitted that they were no good at the language they had learned in school ( usually french , german or spanish ) and sometimes boasted the 3-4 sentences they could still remember . 
  still , i agree with you , there are good foreign language students out there . 
  ** and to everyone who is not an english native speaker : ** if you come across someone who is clearly an english native speaker but trying to speak your language , do n't just switch to english because it 's easier for you or because you want to practice your english ( there 's heaps of native speakers who do n't try to speak your lingo for that ) but instead encourage them and help them practice . 
  just do at least a bit of small talk with them , more if possible . 
  because i know exactly what convinced me to freshen up my high school french - it was not the younger french people in australia who travelled in groups ( the ones who were travelling alone were fine , but they obviously wanted to improve their english ) and just spoke rapid french with a lot of slang and ignored everyone who could n't keep up with them ( everyone who was n't native french ) . 
  it was the french family i met while in laos . 
  it was the older french couple in phnom penh . 
  the cambodian grandma coming to the parent-teacher conference at my school and the old cambodian guy who sat next to me on the bus ride to the coast who both spoke french . 
  they were happy to speak slower , help me when i got stuck and encouraged me to speak instead of giving me up for being a hopeless case . 
  `` ich komme aus schottland '' * still , pretty good for someone from the british isles . 
  and the accent was n't too bad :d, 
  * `` ich habe ein kaninchen '' * still remember , a scottish girl i met while doing working holiday in australia `` learned '' german in school . 
  that was her favourite sentence of the 4 she knew . 
  * istanbul was constantinople now it 's istanbul , not constantinople been a long time gone , constantinople now it 's turkish delight on a moonlit night *,
