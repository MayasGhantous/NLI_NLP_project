  ( ** pension is safe/guaranteed !,

  ( ** i am gay and that 's a good thing !, 
  ** ) klaus wowereit then campaigning for mayor of berlin , 2001 he was coming out in front of his campaign , do n't know if bild would have tried to smear him otherwise and a special one which is important now with the nsa , the gchq and all the other perverts spying on us for `` security '' :  `` ich liebe -- ich liebe doch alle -- alle menschen -- na ich liebe doch -- ich setze mich doch daf\u00fcr ein . '', 
  ( ** i love - but i love all - all people - well but i love - but i am committed towards . 
  ** ) erich mielke , minister for state security ( `` staatssicherheit '' abr stasi , the east german secret police , responsible for spying on all their citizens for `` security '' ) , november 1989 speaking in front of the east german parliament . 
  he was trying to justify the stasi spying in the volkskammer but was interrupted often by heckling or laughter hence the bad start of his speech . 
  i 'd like to see clapper , alexander and their counterparts in the other spying societies share his fate : put on trial and sentenced . 
   i miss our close relations to russia . 
  merkel destroyed our good relations with them in notime . 
  well , that 's something you have to expect from cdu . 
  they are the party of konrad adenauer after all , who started the strict orientation towards the us ( before that german foreign policy was always more eastern oriented - france was the enemy , england on an island but germany could deal with russia , small wars did n't damage the friendship . 
  after ww1 , the german army had r&d in russia to circumvent the versailles arms regulations for instance ) . 
  at that time it was a smart and sensible move . 
  but nowadays the cdu has turned that smart move into brown nosing of epic proportions . 
  the only funny thing about that is that they obviously thought they would be treated differently than us peasants by building a house in washington 's backside . 
  which is probably why merkel got so upset when she found out that they us peeping toms also spied on her . 
  google at the moment only * needs * to block 12 ( i think , it 's definitely a very small number ) songs . 
  gema wants more money , i think twice or three times the amount that google agreed on with all the other composers associations . 
  they launched a lawsuit with those 12 songs as a test balloon . 
  everything else is not enforced right now , hence the message `` gema * may * not have granted us rights '' . 
  gema is to blame because they do n't want to negotiate . 
  they are used to just getting what they want because they are protected by so many rules ( `` gema assumption '' for instance , if a song is played gema just assumes that they own the rights and demand money for it ) . 
  they are cunts , plain and simple . 
  but obviously google is also not the white knight . 
  they do the blocking and blame gema on it - because they know it will get heard . 
  every time someone in germany sees the `` this video is blocked because it * may * contain music for which gema has n't granted us rights '' , they get angry at gema . 
  every time an artist sees that their music video which is supposed to give them promotion is blocked in germany , they blame gema . 
  every time a record company sees a music video which they spent money on is blocked in germany , they blame gema . 
  that 's what they want to achieve , to put domestic pressure on gema to come back to the negotiation table . 
  but to me and to most germans i think , we all could n't care less . 
  we want those guys to get their shit together because playing north korea here in germany is crap . 
  and as long as the rest of the world keeps uploading videos on youtube and not somewhere else , we 're up shit creek without a paddle on this . 
  the more interesting question would be how many of these jobs are minimum wage or low paying jobs . 
  no , i 'm not trying to start a uk bashing , i 'd really like to know because in germany a lot of the jobs that came after the hartz reforms were lower paying jobs , which looked good in statistics but did not that much for domestic demand because people barely earned more than what they got when they were on the dole . 
  of course east germany was a republic . 
  there 's only 2 choices in this : either a republic - head of state gets chosen/elected or a monarchy - head of state is hereditary . 
  and the head of state in east germany was not hereditary , but somehow chosen , so it qualifies as a republic . 
  that 's why being a republic does n't automatically mean something good . 
  [ gro\u00dfe spendenaktion in afrika , um verluste der deutschen bank zu kompensieren ] ( http://www.der-postillon.com/2013/01/groe-spendenaktion-in-afrika-um.html ) * massive fundraiser in africa to compensate losses of deutsche bank * * frankfurt , harare ( dpo ) - that 's real solidarity !, 
  after it became known that deutsche bank had to suffer losses of 1.2 billion eur in the fourth quarter of 2013 , people all over africa have started collecting money . 
  the goal is to raise at least a billion eur , so that the starving stockholders of deutsche bank will receive a decent dividend after all . 
  * * it is the initiators ' opinion that africa has a moral obligation to help because deutsche bank wants to increase their investments in food speculation - a custom that according to co-ceo j\u00fcrgen fitschen fulfils `` an important role for food producers worldwide '' . 
  * * says robert mariga ( 13 ) from zimbabwe to the postillon : `` it hit me like a ton of bricks , when i read that the fourth quarter went that bad for deutsche bank , that the annual profit dwindled to a paltry 1.1 billion eur after tax . 
  i am donating 2 monthly wages so that the managers ' bonuses do n't have to be cut . 
  that 's at least 50 eur . 
  '' * * even with high volume in donations , only a margin of the planned 1 billion has been collected , so several african aid organisations are now planing a huge charity concert with the title `` bank aid '' . 
  all proceeds will be donated to a charity fund for deutsche bank . 
  problem is - we still do n't have a minimum wage ... and where should young jobless germans go ? 
  : o -- anyways , i like the fact that the german `` dual apprenticeship '' is getting some recognition . 
  usually it 's only the `` germany has not enough people with academic degrees '' complaint that come up , which ignores that in our country people do n't get a bachelor 's degree to become pastry chefs or nurse or mechanic , they get hired by a company and do an apprenticeship for 2-3 years . 
  i did n't even mention all the made up things in bild because i think that 's just their daily work . 
  `` do n't know that person 's age ? 
  just make it up ! '', 
  oh yeah , bildblog is a great source for bild lies . 
  [ this one here is great  ( http://www.bildblog.de/53761/edward-allein-zu-haus/ ) a 1991 internal document says that `` experts '' warn about the potential danger of their own system administrators because of all the rights they have in the systems . 
  in 1991 edward snowden was 7 years old . 
  bild : `` nsa was afraid of edward snowden when he was 7 years old ! '', 
  or [ this one ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/53079/zum-brechen-tabu-berichterstattung/ ) - bild has been `` breaking the big taboo '' , `` breaking the last money taboo '' , `` breaking a taboo '' aaaand `` breaking a big taboo '' for a couple of years now ( it 's about who earns what in germany ) . 
  and in the last one they have a member of parliament , that guy is from a town called [ `` munster '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munster,_lower_saxony ) in lower saxony . 
  there 's a huge army base ( a lot of armored units ) there and the german tank museum . 
  but they just relocated the guy to the town of [ m\u00fcnster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m\u00fcnster ) in north rhine-westphalia . 
  and it 's not just a typo because they also put the state . 
  [ next one ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/52725/luegen-haben-dicke-beine/ ) - bild titles `` punishment tax for fat people ! '', 
  but the topic in question was a tax on very fat and very unhealthy * foods * . 
  for me , inventing `` facts '' is part of the daily business of bild . 
  it 's a shame , it could be an awesome satirical newspaper , if they were n't so stubborn about being taken serious ... :d, 
  do n't blame it all on the uk papers ... just remember that bild sent a reporter to greece to `` give the lazy-ass greeks their drachma back '' or just calls them `` skint-greeks '' all the time , has an obsession with getting greece to sell their islands . 
  but that 's just a really tiny part of the smear campaign against greece and they have more hatred , lies and misinformation on wide range of countries and people . 
  do n't let them get started on `` their island '' ( or `` our island '' , but i do n't remember invading it or acquiring it otherwise ) majorca . 
  or on freedom , which in their opinion only involves the freedom to drive on the autobahn without speed limits and without road tolls . 
  most of the times you can just file the stuff they print under `` plain stupid '' and the avid readers under `` retarded morons '' . 
  anyone who actually follows the advice of bild to call the satirical magazine `` titanic '' and complain about `` titanic '' endangering `` our world cup '' because they sent a basket of mixed german sausage to one of the fifa committee just before the decision for the world cup 2006 as a joke is definitely depriving some village of its idiot . 
  but there 's danger in the fact that people actually believe the hate ... 
   thanks for the info , very interesting to know , but i must say do you think an average german in his 30 's or 40 's would keep jumping like an idiot in front of a video camera ? 
  i quote myself : * that 's just a leftover from the 80ies , `` vokuhila mit schenkelbesen '' style . 
  there 's still guys in germany trying to rock that `` business in the front , party in the back '' hairstyle . 
  that guy was one of them . 
  * that bloke is * not * the average german ( thank god , it was bad enough in the 80s and 90s when this hairstyle was popular ) , but still a german . 
   that guy is a gypsy is my point here . 
  i appreciate the input but there 's not a shred of evidence to support your opinion . 
  that was almost 15 years ago when not even poland and czech republic were in the eu . 
  but then again , i am not going to convince you , am i. 
  so just trot along and believe what you want to believe . 
  he 's speaking german and after he slapped the guy he said `` you 've got a problem ? '', 
  slaps him again , `` another problem ? 
  good , now move along . '', 
  and then towards the interviewer `` i do n't fancy talking with those assholes . '', 
  like i said in the other comment , that was a famous red light district guy being interviewed and the person walking up to him definitely was n't a gypsy , that was just some random german guy with a bad hair style . 
  that 's not a gypsy , that 's just a leftover from the 80ies , `` vokuhila mit schenkelbesen '' style . 
  there 's still guys in germany trying to rock that `` business in the front , party in the back '' hairstyle . 
  that guy was one of them . 
  and that video has been around for ages on german webpages because of the casual `` hast du 'n problem ? 
  noch 'n problem ? 
  geh weiter '' attitude of the guy who 's interviewed . 
  that guy was a big shot in hamburgs red light district ( he died a couple of years ago and the tv program was about him , that 's something you have to take into account . 
  edit : i just checked a bit further . 
  the guys name was [ stefan hentschel ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_hentschel ) , a former boxer who became pimp in hamburg 's st. pauli district . 
  he hanged himself in 2006 and the video in question is shot in 2000 . 
  according to the wikipedia article and [ a radio interview with the guy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ay6cqf_hhs ) they were filming for this documentary and these 3 guys just kept harassing and annoying the film crew .
