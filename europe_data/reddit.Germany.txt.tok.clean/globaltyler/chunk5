  so when it was his turn to say something about old times and one of the 3 again kept coming into the picture to disturb them filming , he slapped him because `` he did n't take shit from anyone for 30 years , so he also did n't take shit from those 3 guys '' . 
  so basically 3 retards thinking they 're idiots and one of them got bitch slapped twice . 
  13 or 14 years ago . 
  nothing to do with gypsies . 
   `` i 'd like to stay here but if i ever decide to leave i 'd rather go to germany ; their economy is stronger and they are not as racist as in england . '' germany being described as `` not as racist as ( ... ) england '' , oh how this brings joy to my old heart !, 
  * wipes tear from eyes * but jokes aside , fact is that german media did an equal share of `` omg , the bad people are coming !, 
  run for your ~ ~ lives ~ ~ lovely suburban neighbourhoods ! '', 
  funnily enough , while uk media was all going on about `` all the romanians are coming and they want to take our benefits and our jerbs ! '', 
  it always came across as against the country and people as a whole . 
  german media on the other side usually said something like `` armutszuwanderung '' which probably translates to `` poverty migration '' and they always said '' * from * romania and bulgaria '' . 
  this together with the stories about the `` roma house '' in duisburg made it clear to everyone that they only meant gypsies . 
  but because we do have a bit of a black spot in history when it comes to gypsies as well , german media ca n't say that directly . 
  still , everyone even in romania apparently got the message . 
  and since they do n't like gypsies either , they could relate to the sentiment . 
  tl ; dr : german ( media at least ) were just as racist as the uk media but they did n't target `` normal '' romanians, 
  sadly there is no proper word that translates the full essence of `` beschei\u00dfen '' :d as for my translation , i do n't really know if it 's just the object that 's supposed to be small - maultaschen are n't that small after all  - or the act of cheating , i mean you 're not committing one of the big sins or breaking the 10 commandments . 
  and the wikipedia article translates it `` little cheaters on god '' as well . 
  but in the end both work well enough , some words just ca n't be properly translated into another language . 
   apparently allah is pretty easy to dupe if you have a good lawyer . 
  well , any god is easy to fool , that 's the funny part about religion . 
  christians too will tell you how their god is almighty and can see everything !, 
  and then in the german south in swabia , they invented `` herrgottsbescheisserle '' ( literal translation from the dialect word would be along the lines of `` small cheats on good '' ) , better known as [ `` maultaschen '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maultasche ) to eat on days when religion says that you are not allowed to eat meat . 
  because obviously an almighty god can not see meat if it is covered with pasta :d, 
   off the top of my head , look at the german word ` ihr ' . 
  according to duolingo i know 15 forms of it . 
  which i have to use is entirely dependent on the gender of the noun its used with and the case of said noun . 
  you ca n't rely on duolingo for that . 
  i use it to improve my french at the moment and it also tells me that i know words like '' \u00e0 '' 4 or 5 times . 
  that 's just an entry linked to a unit . 
  and as a german , do n't get me started about french . 
  they have only 2 genders , so it should be a 50 % chance just by guessing , but i get the gender wrong so bloody often ( always have , that was one of my key problems in school ) because they use the wrong one !, 
  the moon is male , the sun is female . 
  not the other way round !, 
  stupid romance languages :d and about english - i did 6 months of teaching esl in cambodia . 
  i 'm pretty sure if those guys could rant about english , they would . 
  cambodian verbs do n't change forms . 
  it 's basically `` i go today , i go tomorrow , i go yesterday '' and they ca n't understand why a language needs to invent past tense forms for that . 
  and then add a whole lot of irregular forms on top of it . 
  and do n't be greedy , every country only gets one film . 
  i 'm pretty sure flying to spain is a lot cheaper than flying to florida could ever be ... and people speak english as a foreign language in both places :d, 
  they do apparently , they published a ` best of ' album where they translated a heap of their songs into english for the japanese market . 
  and the wikipedia page for said [ album ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/love,_peace_%26_money ) says they were inspired by fans from argentina , though the source link is dead . 
  a dane who never made a booze run to the fabled multi storey bottleshop just across the german border and could take it all home no problems thanks to the common market ? 
  i find it hard to believe ...  i am from the south of germany so i have no clue if that place of legend actually exists but it seems to me that nearly every dane and swede that i met somewhere along my travels has been to the place to buy supplies `` for a family function '' ... 
  [ der postillion ] ( http://www.der-postillon.com/ ) now has video `` news '' as well , it 's a satirical site that shows you the intelligence of your average voter because people take those `` news '' for truth , they usually post the best reactions on their facebook page . 
  [ youtube channel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/postillon24?feature=watch ) this is a bit like the german version of the onion sometimes . 
  it 's a german sentence structure but for once i could not get it to work in english without splitting it up in a couple of sentences , which would have diluted the message . 
  so i just posted it anyway :d, 
   `` enormous amounts of money '' i read this line in a dr evil voice ... :d but even i , who am from a country with not an as high amount of ego when it comes to the countries culture and so on , would have felt insulted if some schmuck described workers in my country like this :  taylor , a former republican presidential candidate nicknamed `` the grizz '' , responded with the written equivalent of two fingers . 
  `` do you think we 're stupid ? , '' he replied . 
  `` i 've visited this factory several times . 
  the french workers are paid high wages but only work three hours . 
  they have one hour for their lunch , they talk for three hours and they work for three hours . '', 
   he added : `` you can keep your so called ` workers ' . '', 
  of course i am generalizing a bit . 
  but the circle of people influencing the senile hindenburg in the final years of weimar republic wanted democracy to fail . 
  they abused the emergency powers of the reichspr\u00e4sident to create the `` pr\u00e4sidialkabinette '' of 1929 onwards ( governments br\u00fcning , von papen , von schleicher and hitler were all without a majority in the reichstag , but they did not govern like a minority government , those governments ruled by `` notverordnungen '' , emergency decrees that were signed by the reichspr\u00e4sident and became law without parliament agreeing . 
  they could be declared invalid by parliament as countermeasure but then again the president could dissolute parliament with a stroke of his pen , that was a real error in the german constitution of 1919 , it made the reichspr\u00e4sident a kind of replacement-kaiser ) now those guys behind hindenburg ( von papen for instance was a member of the `` deutscher herrenclub '' , today we would call it a lobbying association or a think tank , all members were big business , bankers , wealthy land owners or high government officials , that club wanted to `` stop communism '' by changing the constitution and the voting system so that the wealthy would have more influence and their vote would count more , just like in prussia before the end of ww1 ) , their goal was nothing less than the destruction of democracy for their own profit . 
  there is a picture of hindenburg surrounded by von papen , von schleicher and other people that really shows the influence those people had , sadly i ca n't find it only right now . 
  with the `` preussenschlag '' of 1932 von papen had already dissolved the state government in prussia which was a social democratic government . 
  prussia was from then on ruled by a `` reichskommissar '' , a government official from the central government . 
  prussia which equalled ~ 2/3 of german territory was from then on de facto ruled by the reichskanzler . 
  german federalism as counterbalance to the central government basically did not exist any longer . 
  and since the police force was organised by the federal states , the prussian police force was now also under control of the reichskanzler . 
  when hitler was appointed reichskanzler , he put g\u00f6hring in charge of the prussian police by appointing him as `` reichskommissar des inneren f\u00fcr preussen '' , commissary interior minister for prussia . 
  thanks to von papen the nazis were able to build their gestapo from the political division of prussian police . 
  the people like von papen etc. 
  needed hitler and his votes to change the constitution because their own parties ( dnvp etc ) would never get enough seats to reach the 2/3 majority needed . 
  that 's also the ** tl ; dr ** - they could not just invite the kaiser back because they only were in power because of the state of emergency powers of the reichspr\u00e4sident * granted by the constitution * which also stated that germany was a republic . 
  they did not have the popular basis to stage a coup against the republic and they would not have done so because the constitution ( and their abuse of the powers within ) was what kept them in power . 
  the only way for them was a vote to change the constitution and they somehow hoped for the votes from nsdap . 
  ** end tl ; dr ** which was retarded because hitler had his own agenda and it should have been clear to people that he would n't do the bidding of others . 
  but it made the `` machtergreifung '' possible , which otherwise might not even have happened . 
  nsdap had peaked in votes in july 1932 but had lost votes again in november 1932 . 
  and before the coup in prussia , prussia had since 1920 been ruled by a stable great coalition of social democrats and some of the conservatives , contrary to what it was made after ww2 , prussia was actually helping democracy , it had escaped a lot of the turmoil that the central government faced , until 1932 when the excuse of a riot was used for that coup . 
  without the actions of guys like von papen ( he survived ww2 and got to publish 2 books afterwards trying to shift the blame to other people , namely to von schleicher who was killed during the 1934 `` r\u00f6hm-putsch '' and could not defend himself ) the machtergreifung would not have been possible like this . 
  because the machtergreifung was a coup d'etat done in an orderly fashion , it was all somehow in the letter of the constitution . 
  a violent coup by the nazis would have been opposed a lot more as it had been in munich 1923 when hitler first tried a coup against the state of bavaria . 
  there is a quote about germans that sadly still is true today : `` vor die wahl gestellt zwischen unordnung und unrecht w\u00e4hlt der deutsche das unrecht . '', 
  - `` given the choice between disorder and injustice , germans choose injustice . '', 
  hell no . 
  world war 2 resulted from a retarded attempt of some revisionist conservatives and their senile puppet hindenburg to destroy the weimar republic and bring the kaiser back by `` hiring '' hitler . 
  look how well that worked . 
  thanks for those numbers , always good to actually see the quoted statistics or polls from any political argument because every speaker or writer wants to prove their own view with the numbers and just * forgets * everything not supporting him . 
  as a german i like to visit nzz.ch sometimes , especially for a different view on german politics since it is swiss and therefore not as biased as german media . 
  nice to see germany finally making baby steps towards reaching the 20th century in terms of work life balance . 
  well , since a lot of `` regionalf\u00fcrst '' type people rather see themselves cut the ribbon at another useless regional airport instead of modernizing a stretch of autobahn ... 
  i 'm not saying that caused all the problems , but there is a definite tendency to have a few flashy big projects to make yourself look good instead of just maintaining the infrastructure already there . 
  the new airport at kassel-calden is a prime example , there is another regional airport just a 70km drive away . 
  and it has been there for over 40 years , it did n't just pop up over night . 
  but the paderborn airport is in north rhine westphalia while the kassel one is in hesse . 
  and that would just not do to use the airport in the * foreign state * ... oh yeah and for railway infrastructure - i read on spiegel online a while ago that the rhine bridge in cologne is one major bottleneck , if something happens there it causes delays in more than half of german long distance trains . 
  i would n't put it all on the current austerity , the neglect in infrastructure maintenance has been going on for quite some time now . 
  you should 've said that they only speak a weird version of danish , that would 've hurt more , 
   if only bankers had the power to exempt themselves from corruption charges like romanian mp 's have done , who would be the bogey men then ? 
  you mean when they had to pay peanuts for a major crime like fixing libor rates ? 
  if a person commits a crime , not only is everything they made with that crime forfeit but * on top of that * they get punishment . 
  companies get a punishment that is very small in relation to the crime in the first place and on top of that get to keep the earnings from the crime . 
  that 's like letting a bank robber keep the money he stole . 
  imagine they would do that with normal people - if someone makes 30,000 eur/year and knows he can make 200,000 eur with a crime and if he was caught , he 'd go to jail for 4 years * but * he 'd get to keep the money ...
