thank you for sharing . 
  it 's not that they did n't try to put out the fire , but that they did n't even seem to register what was happening . 
  wtf ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  is moral obligation completely out of the window now ? 
  do humanitarian duties only apply to us when they concern our own people ? 
  do we not have the human fucking rights engrained in our constitutions ? 
  do we just say fuck foreigners even when it concerns their very lives ? 
  i 've been looking at this picture for ten minutes and still wo n't believe it 's ireland . 
  you could use `` tongue '' instead of `` leid '', 
  the `` but it 's worse in other countries '' argument is never a good argument . 
  just because there 's relatively little corruption does n't mean we should n't fight it . 
  always strive to improve yourself . 
  boy , i did nazi that coming !, 
  i hate myself . 
  y' all do n't know [ the real thing ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/flag_of_the_german_empire.svg ), 
  it 's janukowitsch in german . 
  we actually had very similar thread about the transcriptions here in / r/europe a while ago . 
  is there anything that we could do to help ? 
  the first video is age restricted now , here 's an unrestricted link for the lazy : http://www.youtube.com/embed/2q4tazykv3y, 
  and does n't anyone dare say otherwise !, 
  and of course that is the fault of martin schulz then . 
   bitches mine is the official latin transliteration of his name . 
  how can there be an `` official '' latin transliteration ? 
  the letters of the latin alphabet have all kinds of phonetic values depending on the language whose alphabet they 're used in . 
  that looks more like the english transcription to me . 
  if you wanted an official * latin * transcription , i 'm guessing it would be ianucovits or ian\u016bcovits . 
  i , personally see myself more as a citizen of europe than one of germany . 
  though i 'm not an especially patriotic or nationally identifiying guy to begin with . 
  well since spain is a constitutional republic , the monarch does n't have any real power , does he ? 
  of course it has to be considered that especialy because of his wealth , he has at least some * de facto * power . 
  that means that what we 're comparing here is the rule of corporations against the rule of corporations and a monarch . 
  neither seems very favorable to me . 
   i was talking more about a cultural aspect . 
  as we saw with events such as the willie and kate wedding , the royal family is still a massive force in popular culture whether we like it or not . 
  and to many people i 've met in the commonwealth , the royal family is still seen as a source of national pride and history . 
  but if the monarchy was abolished then surely that would n't mean that britain 's national pride would be severely weakened . 
  the people would always find other reasons to be proud of their nation , they do n't need a monarch . 
  again , look at countries like france , which always practice strong patriotism despite not having a monarch . 
   i also feel personally that the queen herself also contributes to national stability in one way or another , as she is more often than not seen as a `` champion of the people '' , and seen as quite a progressive when it comes to major issues such as civil rights and democratic values ( a voice of reason in a political system filled with cunts ) , meaning that many trust her to step up if the country starts going to shit internally . 
  quite an extreme unbelievably unlikely example being if dave wanted to pass a law making him supreme protector for life , the queen could refuse to sign the law , causing a constitutional crisis and telling us all that something serious is going down . 
  something i do n't see countries like the usa having the benefit of in my limited knowledge . 
  i 'm not british , so i do n't have an inside view of the reputation of the queen in your country , but i reckon it 's 50/50 ? 
  i doubt that the queen is the binding force that holds the british people together . 
  a people will often enough take pride in just being the people that they are , relying on each other for their pride rather than a monarch . 
  as for those laws , i 'm fairly certain the queen does n't nearly have that much actual power . 
  there was a case on belgium or the netherlands a few decades ago when the king refused to sign a law about abortion . 
  what did they do ? 
  they abolished him for a day and then set him in again . 
  the queen may * de jure * have some power , but de facto it 's probably closer to zero . 
  edit : as an example , how do you feel about cameron 's ( or dave 's ) internet pornography laws ? 
  again , as a non-brit i do n't have that good a picture of the political situation in your country , but i think what he 's doing really is a horrendous step in the wrong direction , towards censorship . 
  i 'm losing pretty much all sympathy for the guy . 
  and what is the queen doing ? 
  nothing . 
  / edit generally , it 's true that the queen does carry a strong symbolism , but by looking at those republics which abolished their monarchy even in the recent past , i guess the syymbolic function that they serve would always be substituted by something else . 
  it 's not hard for patriots to come up with a reason for being patriotic , and they can do so without a monarch . 
  i 'm saying that corporations rule the world . 
  in spain corporations have unjustified power just as well as in western republics . 
  it is n't an exception because they still have a monarch . 
  but they do n't rule anymore , they only have the representative function left . 
  if we were to establish a class that is desgined to rule , then i do n't think it would maintain its standard over a very long time . 
  if you look at the uk before it became a constitutional monarchy : the british monarchs were surely not especially bad , but they were still absolutarian in their rule , were n't they ? 
  by any means , it was n't a fair system . 
  by looking at history , we can conclude that any class which was designed to be a ruling class will , just by matter of time , devolve into an unqualified , and some might say perverted , accumulation of inconsiderate oligarchs . 
  oh , the monarchies of europe , truthfully maintaining their dignity and sincereness which they were originally awarded their royalty and recognition of the people for . 
  yep , because obviously in constitutional monarchies money has no power at all and the monarch rules over all . 
  no capitalistic perversion in spain , nope , never . 
  but do you seriously think that if britain abolished its monarchy , its reputation in the world would suddenly sink to the bottom ? 
  do you think other nations would cut ties with britain because they dared to remove their monarchy ? 
  do you think all of a sudden britain would be deep in debt and struggling with financial issues ? 
  i do n't see how the royal family is a significant for the stabilization of your country . 
  look at the strong republics of europe , they did n't exactly suffer under the voluntary removal of their monarchy . 
  could you at least teach elizabeth how to smile ? 
  this is just what i wanted to write . 
  though i 'm generally republican ( not implying that you 're not btw ) , and am honestly delighted at every monarchy that i witness abandoned ; as long as it does n't result in a dictatorship or something ) . 
  meanwhile , the british monarchy especially could n't piss me off more with all their sparkling publicity . 
  this is the first step of a big change that ** might ** , ** possibly ** happen but if so is way overdue and at the moment still a ridiculous measure when compared to the disrespectful , human-rights-beshitting behaviour that was and largely still is practised by the governments of countless western nations concerning the nsa/snowden affair . 
  really ? 
  then who was it ? 
  and if the perpetrator 's identity was vague , then it 's important to take into consideration the possibility that some shady operations were fueled by government orders . 
  of course this is n't proven , but from the news , it does n't seem too unlikely . 
  anyway , i 'd read back when it happened that the orders might have come from cameron himself . 
  ca n't find link , sorry . 
  forcing journalists to destroy hard drives with valuable information is `` criticism '' ? 
  well 2 is the smallest * possible * number , so ... 
  i guess you win . 
  so how many people are minimally required to create the demand for a queue in britain ? 
  i 'd rather classify this as `` zombie-like consumerism problems '' . 
  oh dear , totally did n't see that elephant in the room there . 
  english is a confusing language . 
  that 's what i wrote ? 
  please , do n't spread buzzfeed in / r/europe . 
  i do n't think it 's possible to make a general statement . 
  what makesit even harder for me is that i do n't think i even know any muslims . 
  where i live ( outside munich ) , i guess they would generally be accepted , but then again , it may be different in other places in germany or even just other social environments . 
  please keep in mind that i 'm making a very vague statement here , since obviously i do n't have an overview of the situation in every little town in germany ; but i 'd say the level acceptance is sort of in the middle between present and not present and it swaps a little towards present . 
  but if they viewed the danish society as immoral , why would they be willing to move there ? 
  do n't leave out the gays , mein schweizer bruder . 
  they come into this land from gayistan , refuse to integrate and become straight and even want schools now to teach about gayism !,
