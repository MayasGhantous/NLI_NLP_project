but ... they told us the greece do n't work ? 
  stop destroying my weltbild !, 
  not really , though , at least not in the recent past . 
  there was no major change for eu citizens , and the `` blue card '' system introduced for non-eu citizens was issued only around 7.000 times by the end of 2013 ( and most of those already were in germany before , as students or working otherwise ) . 
  it is imho more a result of the strong economy in germany vs. the high unemployments in other parts of europe . 
  `` global financial crisis '', 
  well ... why ? 
  we once were stopped by hungarian police , 1 km before the romanian border . 
  our driver of the day made his automatic `` turn engine off , turn light off '' routine . 
  and of course , was fined for not having his light turned on . 
  they told us we 'd have to drive back 10 km to the police station to fill out some form , and to pay ~ 100 euros . 
  well , you know . 
  what can we do . 
  it 's the law . 
  either way , we played dumb and completely refused to pay any bribe . 
  they let us go , `` maximum toleranza !, 
  '' , with a 10 euro find we never payed . 
  i then learned that romanian police is no longer allowed to collect fines from foreign cars directly . 
  instead , they need to fill out tons of paperwork , and the fine must be payed electronically . 
  needless to say , we never had any problems in romania . 
  so someone sues , it escalates ( after some years ) to the european court who rules it illegal , giving the lithuanian goverment two years to revoke it . 
  the modify it a little 23 months later , stating it would be legal now . 
  it of course is not , repeat . 
  do n't worry . 
  you 're quite well of compared to [ greenland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) . 
  interesting , i always thought that larger cities have higher homicide rates than countryside . 
  but when looking at berlin and bucarest , they both seem to have lower rates than their surrounding . 
  the colors are capped at a rate of 7 . 
  seems like all those regions are beyond that . 
  the 10 + weeks in southern states is likely an effect of the summer heat . 
  try to teach kids something when it 's 35 \u00b0 c outside and no ac inside . 
  exactly . 
  germany ( or more precise : bavaria , because each state is different ) : * 6 weeks summer * 1 week autum * 2 weeks chrismas * 1 week fasching * 2 weeks eastern * 2 weeks whitsun, 
   latin is not very closely related to any european languages beside those based on latin , which is only about a handful . 
  you mean portuguese , spanish , french , italian , romanian , plus some more local languages , who in total make up around 200 of the 500 million people ( 40 % ) in the eu ? 
  yes . 
  the eu 's `` right of abode '' is not absolute , and commonly called `` right of abode to work '' . 
   citizens of the european economic area ( the european union plus iceland , liechtenstein , and norway ) and switzerland enjoy the freedom to travel and work in any participating country without a work permit or visa [ ... ]  however , rights to reside in another eu/eea state are not absolute . 
  to reside in another eu/eea state , one must either be working , job-hunting , a student , or otherwise have sufficient financial resources and health insurance to ensure they do not become a burden on the social services of the host country , or have a family member who falls in one of those categories . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_abode#eu.2c_eea.2c_and_the_schengen_treaty this seems true for op , since he lacks `` sufficient financial resources and health insurance '' . 
  so there already are some tunnels in place that could be used for the new one ? 
  seriously , we had the exact same discussion in 2011 , when germany finally liftet the working ban for the first round of eastern eu-states . 
  our social system did not collapse , and statistics show , that mostly well-qualified people came . 
  ( not that this would matter to me , personally . ), 
  unemployment among immigrants from eastern eu-states is actually lower than that of germans . 
  so all this is just fear mongering of somewhat right or `` conservative '' politicians . 
  also , all those who wanted to come are already here . 
  some million people have left romania in the last 10 years , many to western europe . 
  and as sad as it makes me , this is often just a disguised discussion of how to keep the roma out , many of who are from romania or bulgaria , and many of who - for whatever reasons - are poor and have little to no education . 
  people see them as beggars in the streets , and this is what shapes the image in politicians heads . 
  some romanians are even mad because people confuse them with roma . 
  i see why all of you are bashing the woman , but also remember how the us system often works . 
  she probably signed away her right to sue to some lawyers , who sue at their own risk , but will keep  50 % of the damages in case of winning ( or setteling , which is probably more common ) . 
  so she risks nothing , and probably does not even believe she would win ; but by not doing so she would throw away the chance of geting at least some money . 
   the city has been sort of built around it not only around , but right through , over and under the old palace . 
  it 's an amazing blend of old and new , with large parts of the remaining palace now renovated . 
  i can only recommend split , too , even though i only saw the center , which was a one-day trip . 
   it is not a tax , because the revenue does not go to the government . 
  it 's an `` access tariff '' which the owners of solar panels that are connected to the grid will have to pay for that privilege , even if no electricity goes to/from the grid , to `` compensate '' utilities for the `` hardship '' of keeping the grid stable . 
  thanks !, 
  we actually have a similar discussion here in germany right now ; many industries are building their own power plants to circumvent the `` green energy fee '' that you pay per kwh you get from the grid . 
  but those industries still maintain fat lines to the grid almost for free , just as backup if their plant goes down . 
  it 's supposed to be changed so you pay ( additionally to the actually consumed energy ) based on the maximum power of your grid connection ( 10 kw , 1 mw etc. ) . 
  i 'm just wondering for spain ; why do n't they simply change the tariffs ? 
  something along the line of `` a grid connection costs 30 eur per month , but for that , the first xxx kwh of energy are free '' . 
  this way , all are treated equally and no special forces unit is required to search houses for solar cells . 
  or do you have to pay even if you are _ not _ connected to the grid ? 
  so , it seems you need to pay a `` tax '' for putting solar up your roof , and this is some sort of heavy tax enforcement . 
  anyone knowning how high this tax is , and how it compares to spanish energy prices ? 
  good for them they are not sitting on oil . 
  a romanian friend told me about the gymnastics schools that young kids are send to . 
  that 's some tough shit they have to go through , in order to move like that ... 
  shit , yes . 
  for a long time , you could just pull fibers over the poles in bucarest for virtually no money ( 1 ct / year / pole ) . 
  this and the high population density lead to really cheap and really fast internet access in bucarest . 
  does n't norway have its share in the arctic ? 
  i 'm sure there is plenty of petroleum for some more generations , once the legal aspects were figured out . 
  other than that , i completely agree . 
  it makes little sense for a richer , stable country that already follows most eu legislation and is part of schengen and eea to join . 
  actually , all of the croatians i talked to said that the actual joining of the eu makes little difference ; the big changes were 5-10 years prior to that , when all the laws required by the eu were put into place . 
  this is exactly what it all was about .

  shut . 
  down . 
  everything !, 
  seems to me that the police can [ still handle the job ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bm8w8aycaaa6flu.jpg:large ), 
  not so much `` germany '' but more `` city that gets flooded ever 10 years '' . 
  if you life next to three large rivers , you kind of got used to it , though it has n't been that heavy since 1954 . 
  i simplified a little . 
  the drone was around 200-250m , the other half was going to eads to build a customized sigint . 
  but yes , it was for a single drone only . 
  not even that . 
  they need a special permission everytime it flies ; from now on , it 's practically grounded . 
  germany : * preparations for the champions league final in london * bayern m\u00fcnchen and bvb arrived in london * international press coverage about the champions league final in london * some player of bvb can not play * all public viewings sold out * etc. 
  apart from that , mostly international news .
