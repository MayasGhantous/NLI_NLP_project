  * minister of defence is in trouble : he bought a drone from the us for 500 million euros , but they need to invest another 500-1000 mil . 
  to get the permission to fly this thing in the eu airspace . 
  the project was now cancelled . 
  * did you hear that germany is the most popular country in the world ? 
  and 95 % `` green '' . 
  norway , yay !, 
  ( i know , i know , different conditions etc. ), 
  i see it the same way . 
  we must prevent another 2008/2009 crisis by all means . 
  if this means more regulation of the financial sector , so be it . 
  this is a pragmatic way of avoiding another economy fuckup at a global scale . 
  it just does n't make sense if banks can take high risks and gain high rewards , only to let the government pay if it goes wrong because they are `` too big to fail '' . 
  this article is simple lobbying , as one can expect . 
   the volume of futures trading fell by 98 % and the options trading market disappeared . 
  [ 1 ]  this is horrible !, 
  i 'm not sure if you 're sarcastic ;-) anyway , i 'd say that was exactly why the tax was put into place . 
  during the crisis , futures and options were identified as a potentially very dangerous tool . 
  after all , the financial transaction tax is not really supposed to raise much money for the gouverment , it is meant to control the market and to reduce high-risk investments . 
  in this sense , sweden shows that the tax works as planned . 
  ( i 'm not arguing for or against , but this is how i understood it . ), 
  edit : also , sweden is relatively small , meaning that many of the transactions were simply moved to other countries . 
  if all of the eu introduces this tax , evasion is more difficult . 
  somebody care to explain ? 
  i read the article about bribe accusations , but there is probably more happening behind the scenes . 
  oh my , you should move to germany then . 
  the developement plans are very strict in large parts of the countryside , leaving the same type of house all over an area . 
  i find this very boring , but , well , tastes are different . 
  norway has half the population and produces  95 % of its electricity from renewables for decades . 
  meaning that portugal was not the first country of this size to achieve this . 
  ( though of course the conditions are completely different . ), 
  well , we 'll see about that once they meet the corresponding criterias . 
  until then it 's just washi washi of politicians who want to profile themselves and gain advantage of the euro crisis by being `` anti-euro '' . 
  and this is a huge difference in terms of trust . 
  cyprus has a deposit insurance up to 100k [ 1 ] . 
  the deposit insurance means that even if your bank fails , all money you have there is insured up to 100k . 
  now , taxing accounts with less than that amount because the bank is bankrupt simply negates this promise . 
  i know , it 's technically a ` tax ' and not ` money lost due to bank being bankrupt ' . 
  in reality , you lose that money and it 's given to the bank ( or the banks shareholders or whoever the bank owns money ) this undermines all the trust we have in our banking system and the deposit insurance . 
  if this would be implemented , people in all the countries with even a slight crisis ( italy , spain ) would move all their money to banks in other countries . 
  the consequences of such a bank run are well known . 
  ( actually , the fact that it was even thought about is likely to have ruined all trust already . ), 
  [ 1 ] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deposit_insurance#by_eu_country, 
  also , * what * are you so fanatical about ? 
  is this the `` classic '' left vs. right ? 
  ethnic group issues ? 
  [ spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/fluechtlingskrise-geschaeft-mit-den-gefaelschten-paessen-a-1053720.html ) is quoting frontex on the matter . 
  * the majority of the forged passports actually go to syrians who , for some reasons , have no passport but want to ease their asylum process * the german immigration authorities identify non-syrians by the dialect they speak, 
   it is impossible to live in peace with them we have almost 3.000.000 people with turkish roots in germany and a total muslim population of approx . 
  my city has  8 % muslim population . 
  it 's quite peaceful here . 
  tbh , i 've seen the `` people believe it 's mostly women and children '' claim often , but have failed to meet anyone who actually believes it . 
  people , including those with a more moderate view on the refugee situation , are well aware of the demographics of those coming . 
   and you 're implying that the church does n't do anything against it but that is exactly what happend multiple times in the past . 
  charges were swept under the rug at multiple levels of the hirachy . 
  it was n't until the last 10-20 years that things really changed , and often only after expensive lawsuits and extensive press coverage . 
   some individuals child abuse extends ( or extended ) far further that just `` some individuals '' . 
  those were responses to terrorist attacks , something that we had in waves since the end of wwii . 
  not a response to migration . 
  no , it 's way too few migrants to have such a significant impact . 
  besides , some of them will work as well . 
   and the right will end up hurting the middle and working classes worse than immigration . 
  this i by far the greatest risk at hand . 
  right-wing parties are almost exclusively bad for the economy in the long run . 
   the european left needs to get its shit together . 
  no , the political center needs to get its shit together and not leave people afraid , driving them towards right-wing parties . 
  which part - that germany has no `` forbidden tree '' system , or that you do n't have to incriminate yourself ? 
  that depends on the country . 
  it is almost always admissible in germany , for example . 
  anyway , even as witness , you never have to say anything that incriminates yourself . 
  exactly what they stated :  it helps keep the service `` secure '' for ** its ** 1.5 billion users they keep ** facebook users ** safe by blocking log-in attempts of bots and the like . 
  in other words , they keep facebook accounts safe . 
  i 'm not saying that this actually works or that this would n't be a lame excuse to justify tracking of simply everybody . 
  but this is how they explain it . 
  from what i read somewhere else : they create profiles of browsers to check if they show a `` normal '' usage pattern , or if they might be spammers / scripts / bots . 
  for example , a browser claiming to be ff that visits 1.000 websites an hour is likely fake . 
  one that visits 4 news sites per hour is probably not . 
  when that browser later tries to log into fb , it is only allowed instantly if it showed that `` normal '' usage pattern before . 
  otherwise , some security measures are engaged ( for example requiring additional verification before logging in ) . 
  since ghostery blocked the first layer of included ad platforms , many of the second layers ( that are included by the first layer ) wo n't show up . 
  if you whitelist the site and re-load , ghostery will likely show much more than the 6 . 
  dual citizenship is possible if the second country is in the eu , is the usa or one of many other countries we have bilateral contracts with . 
  i thought they only come for vacation ? 
  true , and for the very pragmatic reason that economies do not like uncertainty . 
  it stalls investments while managers wait for how things will evolve . 
  that said , it 's better ( for the economy of both sides ! ), 
  to now go through with it as fast as possible , rather than prolonging the process for years . 
  the inevitable loud negotiations about the exit agreements ( `` no immigrants '' - `` ok then no market access ! '' ), 
  will hurt the economy , no matter the final outcome . 
  can they ? 
  there is no right of revoking a call to art . 
  50 , or is there ? 
   i think once it 's triggered though it 's impossible to back out . 
  that is apparently still under discussion . 
  a report to the uk parliament said that one could back out within the two years , the eu stated you could not . 
  since article 50 does not mention it at all , the uk report was citing some treaty that handles how treaties are to be handled . 
  apparently , that meta treaty has some clause stating that a notice could be revoked . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  what advantages are you expecting ? 
  the lateran treaty says otherwise . 
  what do the statistics say ?
