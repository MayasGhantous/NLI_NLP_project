you know that i have a point . 
  that 's why you do n't answer my comment properly . 
  would n't the people vote left parties then ? 
  many right parties have actually quite libertarian-like approaches . 
  i do n't think this is about income inequality . 
  i think leftists like you just want to take credit for this movement . 
  like i said , this case is crystal clear . 
  i will delete account if they get sued . 
   the school you are funding now are training the next gen of workers . 
  if a couple years down the line you have to close a number of them or people are out of places for higher education ( or ca n't afford university for lmb because it 's now for profit and 20 ' 000 $ a year ) because the budget collapse for lack of tax income , it 'll do a real number on the economy . 
  that was n't what i meant . 
  we simply do n't pay for things in the future with today 's taxes . 
   talk for yourself , i do n't agree with this situation . 
  you 're lucky that you live in france . 
  the situation is n't that bad there , but look at the birth rate of germany or japan . 
  we 're fucked . 
  this is n't going to work . 
   i disagree , the double irish & dutch 0 taxes guaranteed sandwitch was very clever . 
  took 10 years for authorities to even react . 
  i might took them long to react because of legal reasons , but it is an open secret than a lot of companies are doing that . 
   apart declaring all those loopholes void and simply collecting taxes you mean . 
  opening branches/registrating in other countries is n't a crime or a loophole . 
  look at cayman island . 
  there is not a thing foreign governments can do about that . 
   due to automatic shadow balancing of tax contributions indexed on the gdp , so if they all pay in romania gdp rise and romania pays more and get a bit less that not how it works . 
  if a german company pays taxes in romania it 's 1 ) less that they would pay in germany and 2 ) every eu country would have to pay less , not just germany , even though germany would have gotten all of these taxes . 
  so instead of getting 100 % of that cake , germany gets maybe something like 5 % of that cake . 
   but if they do n't pay anything anywhere , like a lot of corporations are currently doing like what company ? 
   because obviously the article says everything there is to know on that case and officials are proud to admit they just took many euros and even says it in newspapers / s http://www.dw.com/en/basf-in-firing-line-for-legal-but-immoral-tax-deals/a-36299377 this case is crystal clear . 
  nothing will happen . 
   you are blatantly wrong . 
  infrastructure , education and healthcare are funded throught taxes the infrastructure , education and healthcare ** now ** are funded throught taxes . 
  you mentioned the next generation . 
  we do n't fund the future generations . 
  i do n't know where you got this from . 
   that only works if you do collect them . 
  which was n't happening here . 
  and basf is far from being the only case . 
  cf apple , mcdonalds , microsoft and plenty of others company caught red handed doing exactly the same ( using clever financial tricks to legally not pay anything anywhere ) . 
  no , this wo n't work . 
  there is a good chance that people born after 2000 wo n't see a penny of the taxes they payed for retirement when they retire . 
  we do n't pay for ourselves , we pay for the current retired people . 
  apart from that i agree . 
  those tricks are n't clever though . 
  they simply outsource their taxes to countries where they have to pay less . 
  even when the eu finally stops that , those companies can still outsource their taxes to other countries such as china . 
  there is n't really anything we can do to stop that . 
  there is n't some kind of international law that states that companies have to pay taxes in a certain country . 
  the oecd is working on something like that though . 
  what apple did was illegal not because they outsourced their taxes , but because they made a special agreement with ireland which is illegal in eu law . 
   no they did n't since they did n't paid any of it . 
   nor anywhere else . 
  that 's kind of the problem . 
  have you read anything on that other than the title of this post ? 
   ah so there we go back to the `` i know we are c ** nts and the next generations wo n't have universities or healthcare or retirement but it 's legal for us not to pay taxes '' that killed greece . 
  how has that anything to do with this case ? 
  you do understand that our taxes today do n't pay for any of those things tomorrow right ? 
  in fact taxes will rise because we have more and more old people . 
  and you yourself probably wo n't see a penny of anything you ever payed because there is nobody to support your retirement . 
   past proven exemple of corporations bribing their way into getting what they want in germany bribing has nothing to do with tax avoidance . 
  and according to wikipedia they tried tro bribe their way in india and greece , not germany . 
   that 's exactly what basf intend to do , using twists on wording of the law . 
  they actually paid their fair shair of taxes , just some of it not in germany . 
  they used certain benefits in countries like belgium and the netherlands . 
  this is completely legal . 
  but they should really change eu law so this does n't happen anymore . 
  a single economic zone must have equal conditions eveywhere . 
  eu countries should n't be supposed to compete with each other . 
  like i said , i do n't doubt that this has negative effects on one end . 
  there 's a reason why we pay taxes . 
  but from an economic point of view , less taxes means more productivity which means more workers are required . 
  the reason why we have taxes it that the government wants to control where exactly this money is going . 
  not everyone can work . 
  some are disabled , a lot of people are too old to work ( pensioneers ) and some lack the fundamental education . 
  this is why we have the system we have right now . 
  my point is that it 's not like the 1bn are completely wasted . 
  it 's not like some billionaire bought some yacht from it . 
  there is something called the `` circular flow of income '' which says that money never gets lost . 
  the biggest part of a companies profit gets reinvested in the company in form of new technology , bigger factories , ** more workers ** and so on . 
  the ultimate goal of a company is growth . 
  really everyone profits from a growing company . 
  the government , the managers , the workers , banks . 
  everyone . 
  we do n't know the net outcome of this . 
  it 's nearly impossible to calculate . 
  there are too many variables involved . 
  but to say that `` 1bn just got wasted '' is exeggerated . 
  this should n't happen again , but it 's not as bad as portrayed . 
   that did n't appeared to stop rheinmetal in the first place , what are you talking about ? 
  i have to correct myself : i meant to say `` avoidance '' instead of `` evasion '' . 
  avoidance is completely legal . 
  evasion is n't . 
  the difference is n't a `` technicality '' ( the correct word ) . 
  it 's the difference between legal and illegal . 
  `` tax fraud against the federal government consists of the willful attempt to ** evade or defeat ** the payment of taxes due and owing '', 
  this ca n't possibly work because there is a whole ministry that 's responsible for taxes . 
  in cases like this there are always several reviewers from different areas involved . 
  why do the politicians have to be corrupt ? 
  are you aware what `` evasion '' means ? 
  everything they did was completely legal .
