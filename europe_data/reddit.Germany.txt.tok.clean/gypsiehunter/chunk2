  they used loopholes that will get closed now . 
  it 's a mistake by the lawmakers ( parliament ) and not some `` corrupt poltiicans within the government '' . 
   the likelihood of workers not getting hired because of tax evasion is equally high . 
  it 's not . 
  what are companies doing to get more money ? 
  they expand . 
  what do you need to expand ? 
  more workers . 
   eg an unemployed person goes to the local supermarket to buy groceries -  the supermarket pays wages and buys new stock etc i do n't get what you 're trying to say . 
  please eleborate . 
  yes i agree . 
  my point was that islamists like the woman in this video are muslim fundamentalists . 
  i did n't doubt all of that , but you said that specifically workers do n't profit from that . 
  that is wrong . 
  the likelihood that because of the tax evasion the company employed more workers due to a higher profit is quite high . 
  the question is : how is the relation between the new jobs that were created and the money that did n't fund redistribution instead . 
  this would be a pretty hard calculation . 
  less taxes - more money for workers ( definitely not less ) . 
  i do n't see how it negatively affects the workers . 
  at the same time you said `` that 's not muslim [ ... ] that 's fundamentalist '' . 
  she 's a muslim fundamentalist . 
  kkk are christian fundamentalists . 
  we do n't have a free market , we do have plenty of regulations . 
  do n't build up a straw man . 
  germany does n't profit one bit from letting them avoid 1 billion in taxes . 
  ministers are n't supposed to be experts on their topics . 
  merkel was the environmental minister once with a degree in physics . 
  von der leyen switched from being family minister to being defense minister with a degree in medicine and economics . 
  politicians have to have decision making ability . 
  it 's not about having a lot of knowledge about a certain topic . 
  they have people that have that . 
  it 's not a technocracy . 
  sch\u00e4uble has been a politician for decades . 
  he has the experience and political credibility to comment on topics like that . 
  it strange because german turks definitely do n't look this diverse . 
   it conjoins the political entity of germany ( brd ) to the cultural entity of the deutsche volk , from which it derives its legitimacy , ** just like all previous expressions of german nationalism ** . 
  `` only a national comrade ( `` volksgenosse '' ) can be a citizen . 
  to be a national comrade one must have german blood . 
  no jew can therefore be a national comrade . '', 
  that obviously was n't part of the constitution . 
   it conjoins the political entity of germany ( brd ) to the cultural entity of the deutsche volk that is correct . 
  but is it nationalism ? 
  the german constitution rules out every form of exclusive , monoethnic nationalism which is what we today view as nationalism . 
  definition of `` nation '' follows below . 
   it seems to be saying that more than one ethnicity ca n't be included in the same nation , which seems rather close to racism . 
  `` a nation ( from latin : natio , `` people , tribe , kin , genus , class , flock '' ) is a large group or collective of people with common characteristics attributed to them - including language , traditions , mores ( customs ) , habitus ( habits ) , ** and ethnicity . 
  ** '' a nation states is therefore supposed to be monoethnic . 
  examples from wikipedia : japan , poland , korea , iceland and egypt . 
  germany like the us would only be a nation state if you ignored the component of ethnicity in a nation ( civic nationalism/inclusive nationalism ) . 
  so we agree that there is n't one fixed definition for nationalism . 
  to say germans are unknowingly nationalist without clarifying what you mean by that makes it kind of redundant . 
  `` civic nationalism , also known as liberal nationalism , is a kind of nationalism identified by political philosophers who believe in a non-xenophobic form of nationalism compatible with values of freedom , tolerance , equality , and individual rights . '', 
  this is what we call `` inclusive nationalism '' which is essentially the same as patriotism . 
  this kind of nationalism is usually not a problem , but the lines between this and exclusive nationalism ( similar to the concept of [ chauvinism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chauvinism ) ) can sometimes become blurry . 
  it is then easier to simply reject all kinds of nationalism . 
  patriotism on the other hand is a different topic . 
  nobody would say that he 's a nationalist in germany ( it 's derogatory ) , but some consider themselves to be patriotic . 
  i do n't have a problem with that as patriotism usually does n't include xenophobia . 
   what europeans say about nationalism is as uninformed as what ignorant americans say about socialism on / r/shitamericanssay . 
  i ca n't think of anything good that can come out of nationalism so i 'm not really interested in differentiating between different kinds of nationalism when i use the term . 
  `` nationalist ideas '' . 
  do you know what nationalist ideas are ? 
  roughly translated : `` only a national comrade ( `` volksgenosse '' ) can be a citizen . 
  to be a national comrade one must have german blood . 
  no jew can therefore be a national comrade . '', 
  this is how we europeans interpret the term nationalism . 
  you said there is a clear definition ( which is not true ) . 
  so what is this quote if not nationalism ? 
  if there is n't a clear definition , then why do you think you can determine wether we are nationalist or not ? 
  i do n't think germany is a nation state ( anymore ) . 
  one quarter of our population is n't originally from germany . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multinational_state your wikipedia link on nation states :  a nation state is a type of state that conjoins the political entity of a state to the cultural entity of a nation , from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and potentially its status as a sovereign state that 's not how or why the brd was founded . 
  nowhere is something like that written in our constitution . 
  you 're lacking background information . 
  the brd never formally acknowledged the souvereignity of the ddr . 
  there was only one legitimate germany . 
  barsoap already emphazised that . 
  `` reunification '' means that the ddr was absorbed by the brd . 
  the ddr was n't absorbed because it was a german state as well , they were absorbed because as a correction of the things that went wrong . 
  `` let 's be one nation '' is therefore wrong . 
  there has always been one nation called bundesrepublik deutschland ( which it is still called today ) and one illegitimate state of germany . 
  it has never been about `` germans belonging to germany '' . 
  the country was divided by a big wall and nobody wanted that . 
  germans wanted to travel to all parts of germany and be able to visit their families and friends . 
  the east germans wanted to have the nice products of the west . 
  these were the reasons why germans wanted to be united . 
  not nationalism . 
  german nationalism was already long dead at that time . 
  you just do n't want to accept that people do n't need nationalism . 
  nationalism is a thing of the past . 
  nationalism is the last thing that will make your country `` great again '' . 
  it was nationalism in 1848/49 and the following years , but the german ** reunification ** had nothing to do with nationalist feelings . 
  germany was a politically divided country and not simply two countries sharing many similarities that wanted to unite . 
  wrong . 
  nationalism does n't have a fixed definition . 
  liberal art student detected . 
  you should look at their election platform : economy-wise they 're on par with our liberal party fdp . 
  they have more or less the same views on homosexuality , family and genders as the csu . 
  they do n't like the eu , but do n't even want an exit like other parties in the eu . 
  their most controversial topic is the immigrant crisis .
