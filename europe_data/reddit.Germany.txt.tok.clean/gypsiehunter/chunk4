  the eu did in a way limit the national souveignity of gb ( every deal does it in a way ) , but it 's unreasonable to place some theoretical principle above the real interests of a country . 
  it 's a very american thing to do . 
  the freedom of movement and trade was in a way also a concept of liberty . 
  now they have to give up that liberty . 
  the restictions of the eu were n't there to `` enslave '' the countries , they were there to make the concept of freedom of movement and trade possible . 
  without the equality of certain standards a single market is n't possible . 
  because of the brexit britain lost many of those priviliges to get `` independent '' . 
  in my opinion it was an unreasonable , emotion based decision . 
  being `` independent '' ( as if they were n't independent before ) will make them lose a lot of money and individual freedom . 
   do n't worry , the less educated people wo n't use the system for most of them , they 'll have to learn what do you mean by that ? 
   and if the poeple do n't agree with the politicians assemblee decision , they can petition to do a referendum . 
  people can already petition to do a referendum . 
  i think you 're point is that you want politicians and ( knowledgable ) citizens deciding together , but i did n't really understand how you want to determine who is knowledgable ( `` specialists or specialized citizens '' ) . 
  there is also a danger with giving power to technocrats . 
  they usually evaluate wether something is `` effective '' or not . 
  they often do n't take into account moral questions or other things which they are n't specialized in . 
  politicians are humas , but they do n't simply vote without knowing about a topic . 
  it 's their job to inform themselves by asking specialists . 
  the reason why those specialists do n't do it themselves is , like i said , the danger of technocracy . 
  i do n't think there is a big difference to what you described and to what the politicians are already doing . 
  obama for example gets adviced by a ton of people , so do the ministers ( a ministry consists of hundreds of specialists ) or the individual members of parliament . 
  the system you described seems very ineffective and inflexible . 
  it would bureaucratise the system even more . 
  yeah , that was just the first part of the passage which i quoted . 
   that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends only then ( by a motion of no confidence ) . 
  but the current governments in all of the western democracies are not destructive . 
  all respect those rights . 
   deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that 's just what a ( parliamentary ) democracy is . 
  people vote politicians . 
  it does n't give the people the right to simply change the system if they do n't like it . 
  important : ** government = / = the system ** . 
   ` in such form as , to them , shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness ' means it 's their right to decide the form their government takes no , it is n't . 
  the following passage explicitely states under which circumstances it is allowed to change the system ( to revolt ) . 
  the people can vote the government and they can reelect the government if they think it does n't represent them anymore ( motion of no confidence ) , but they ca n't change the system of parliamentary democracy . 
  nowhere is it written that they can . 
  i think it is pretty clear what the authors meant . 
  this passage also was n't related to the british rule at all . 
  this one was ( and it 's pretty reasonable ) :  when in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature 's god entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . 
   prudence , indeed , will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed . 
  but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security . 
  it justifies revolution when the government harms natural rights like freedom of speech , right to live and equality . 
  rights that all exist in your and our current democratic system . 
  it is only allowed to `` create and dissolve '' governments when they explcitely ignore those rights and act autocratic ( `` despotism '' ) . 
  again :  the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter . 
  in other words : unreasonable populism . 
   except the fact that politics have no idea how to make such a thing work and that they fear that more than anything . 
  i know that you people like to insult politicians as stupid , but they 're ( mostly ) not . 
  they 're more intelligent than the average voter . 
  it 's their job to know what 's going on . 
  it 's their job to evaluate every decision they make . 
   the people create it , and the people can dissolve it no , they ca n't . 
  that 's prohibited by constitutions to prevent dictatorship . 
  constitutions prohibit changes of the democratic system . 
  the people can change their government by voting repesentatives who share the same ideology , but thoroughly evaluate decisions . 
  that 's their job . 
  parliaments do n't just manage the states affairs ( that 's mainly what the government does ) , they represent the electorate , make laws and oversee the government . 
  there is nevertheless a reason why we do n't have direct democracies . 
  why do you think we have parliamentary democracies in the first place ? 
  why do n't we all just have direct democracies ? 
  all power to the people . 
  communism , fuck yeah . 
  i bet people like you were the first ones who condemned refenderums when asked about joining the eu back then . 
  first , it was n't `` germany '' but merkel . 
  a lot of people and polticians on the right ( also the majority of her party ) disagree with her decision . 
  also : you already said it . 
  you did n't take your `` fair share '' ( like most of the other countries ) and you did n't get punished , so why leave the eu in the first place ? 
   you do n't need a degree in economics to see the eu for what it really is . 
  you 're right , but ask `` normal '' people on the street what they think the eu did good for them . 
  neither the majority of the remain nor the majority of the leave capaign will really be able to tell you that . 
  but using buzzwords like `` freedom '' , `` independence '' and `` brussel burocrats '' will trigger even the dumbest of the dumbest . 
  my country supported the holocaust . 
  i think i know what direct democracy can cause . 
  people are stupid and easily influenced by propaganda which is what happened in your country as well . 
   the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter . 
  you know who said this . 
  `` the people '' should n't be able to vote about something as important as a brexit . 
  especially since the majority ca n't grasp the dimension of such a decision . 
  not everyone majored in economics . 
  this referendum was the perfect example of why we have a parliamentary democracy . 
  even though this referendum was not binding , it should n't have had happened . 
  cameron did this solely to strengthen his party . 
  he failed and now your country has to suffer the consequences . 
  except for the fall of the pound ( which eventually will recover ) nothing big has happened ** yet ** . 
  that 's true . 
  but that 's because gb is still in the eu . 
  the uncertainty and the harsh reaction of the eu is what frightens and destabilizes the country . 
  corbyn gets critizised for not doing enough , cameron resigned , johnson runs away from his responsibility and meanwhile farage mocks the eu ( while withdrawing promises ) . 
  the country is leaderless and disoriented . 
  what a mess, 
  netanjahu was right - the un is biased . 
  it 's biased against israel and the western world . 
  even ban ki moon said it . 
  during the same time the un passed 223 resolutions condemning israel , only eight resolutions were passed that condemned the syrian regime as it massacred its citizens . 
  the majority of muslims ( shia and sunnis ) do n't even know that this concept exists . 
  then taqiya is only allowed in sunni islam when your life is under threat . 
  most scholars say that it 's more honorable to endure the struggle than to deny being muslim . 
  partly because of that many sunnis think that shias are no real muslims . 
  there is plenty to critizise when it comes to islam , but the ciriticism of taqiya is based on a ( purposely ) flawed unterstanding . 
  why would isis even want to lie about being muslim ? 
  what would be the advantage ?
