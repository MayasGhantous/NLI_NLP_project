  everyone knows that they 're extremists and it 's not like they 're living together with non-sunnis . 
  taqiyya is a shia concept you idiot . 
  i have never seen something wrong repeated so many times . 
  you guys must feel like you dismantled some secret but in reality you just do n't know your facts . 
  last time i checked he was born in germany , 
  he 's overreacting . 
  there was one instance where a right extremist managed to infiltrate them but apart from that there is nothing special ( good/bad ) about them . 
  it 's mainly left wingers who complain about them because they monitored certain far left politicians . 
  in every talkshow politicians and journals just circle jerk about how bad and dangerous trump is . 
  i actually wanted trump to win for that reason . 
  i do n't condone anything he does but seeing this kind of meltdown over his victory is actually quite funny . 
  source ? 
  you failed to deliver any convincing points . 
  it 's also strange that the cdu as well as the spd disagrees with you . 
  you 're telling me those hundreds of thousands of people are all gays ? 
  those that fled marokko for political reasons have done it long ago when the conflict started . 
  i 'd say the same about germany . 
  there 's nothing wrong with taking in refugees ( we should ) but it has come to a level that just not acceptable anymore . 
  i do n't get this notion that somehow everyone who 's against this mass immigration is a nazi/right wing populist even though countries like france , uk and even canada accepted a tiny fraction of our share . 
  and there are even leftists governments in power in france and canada . 
  i think people lost their sense of perspective . 
  there is also this kind of fascination with american pop culture , but i think it 's getting less with trump in power . 
  people begin to realise that american society can not be so great when they elect someone like trump . 
  he did support agenda 2010 though . 
  but in this comparison merkel would n't be trump or clinton , but bernie sanders as well . 
  true . 
  there really are n't many point that he could attack merkel over . 
  that 's probably why he made `` social justice '' his motto . 
  on the other hand he literally called merkel a social democrat in a talkshow . 
  i 'm quite sure that schulz is secretly a merkel supporter . 
  this is n't really a surprise though . 
  this could be used for all of reddit . 
  for comparison : it 's close to what the entire state of lower saxony made in 2016 . 
  and also : it 's what we payed in 2016 . 
  one year . 
  add 2017/18/19 ... and you see where this is going . 
  this is n't a small sum . 
  that does n't change the fact that that would be unconstitutional . 
  i 'm pretty sure our constitutional court would immediatly object such a law . 
  you ca n't just detain people without any evidence of a crime . 
  the only way is to deport those people . 
  although i do n't necessarily disagree , i 'm pretty sure that that would be illegal . 
  ~ ~ you ca n't simply detain people without any existing crime let alone a trial . ~ ~ edit : you can , but i still think deporting them would be a better choice . 
  the best choice would 've been to not let them into this country in the first place . 
  we do n't have the infrastructure for that and it would be insane to build prisons for something that is only temporary . 
  it would also cost millions if not billions of tax payers money . 
  the soviet union was also a dictatorship . 
  because of that about 50 % of the population is now atheist/agnostic ( according to wikipedia ) , but that does ' t seem to have an effect on the mentality . 
  venezuela is also a 96 % catholic country . 
  lefitst governments do n't necessarily change the overall mentality . 
  the soviet union or eastern germany for example were much more conservative than western europe . 
  russia is still very conservative even though socialists were in power for 74 years . 
  i hear this a lot , but this account simply used to be a troll account, 
  the establishment ( whoever it is at the moment ) , the elite , the wall street , big corporations , the capitalists , the top 1 % etc. 
  left-wing ideology always had a `` we , the people , against them '' mentality . 
  now right wing populism is also jumping on this train . 
  the alt-right movement might be an american substitute for socialism . 
  it 's much easier in the us to be a right wing populist than it is to be a left wing populist . 
  left wing ideologies want to erase concepts like patriotism and nationalism , but those concept are often deeply ingrained in the minds of the people . 
  some anthropologists would say that those are basic human instincts . 
  in history you learn that there are different kinds of rememberance : personal rememberance and collective rememberance ( or direct and indirect rememberance ) . 
  personal rememberance includes the testimonies of contemporary witnesses ( your grandpa telling you stuff about the war for example ) . 
  this has a strong influence on the collective memory of a society . 
  now those witnesses are dying . 
  politicians sometimes are n't even the children of those former soldiers and victims , but the grandchildren . 
  most contempory witnessess are dead and those that still live have little to say . 
  that 's definitely dangerous . 
  now people can claim that certain books or articles or documentaries are `` fake '' or that `` it was n't as bad '' and there are no witnesses that could prove them wrong . 
  even though the evidence is still overwhelming , it gradually becomes easer to dismiss historical facts . 
  especially now with the trend of anti-intellectualism . 
   oktoberfest is nothing , but a big festival in munich . 
  that 's true but , like you mentioned , the whole concept of volksfeste ( dult ) with trachten and dirndl is quite bavarian . 
  that 's kind of what the oktoberfest events in the us are supposed to represent . 
  again , everyone 's free to celebrate oktoberfest . 
  but claiming it 's part of their culture or heritage is a different thing . 
  i do n't really care about cultural appropriation either but it 's nevertheless some form of fake/artificial heritage . 
  i 'm even from further up north . 
  oktoberfest is as foreign to me as it is to tourists from other countries . 
  it 's not about where they 're from . 
  tourists at the oktoberfest in munich do n't claim it 's part of their culture . 
  it 's the opposite : they want to experience this traditional bavarian tradition . 
  and they 're welcome . 
  americans claiming it 's part of their heritage even though it 's not , is a completely different matter . 
  of course they 're free to celebrate it . 
  everyone is . 
  but it 's a bit strange that they do it together with celebrating their german heritage . 
  the problem is that the ancestors of those that celebrate oktoberfest and wear traditional clothes probably are n't even from bavaria . 
  oktoberfest is celebrated in the bavarian part of bavaria ( less than 50 % of bavaria , the other parts are franconia and swabia ) . 
  not even in the whole state . 
  and even then the state bavaria is only one out of 16 . 
  lower and upper bavaria together have a population of 5.5 million . 
  pretending all of those are `` ethnic '' bavarians , that would mean that oktoberfest and those traditional clothes are part of the culture of only about 6 percent of all germans . 
  but germans from all parts of germany immigrated to the us . 
  if we assume that the percentages are the same , then that would mean that oktoberfest is part of the `` heritage '' of only 6 percent of american `` germans '' . 
  yet most act like it 's a part of their culture . 
  it 's artifical heritage and it 's cultural appropriation . 
  `` celebrates our german heritage though oktoberfest '' as someone who 's not from bavaria that triggers me . 
  i would argue that it makes little sense that this ** 18 year old ** iranian ** immigrant ** ( which you conveniently left out ) was seriously a racist . 
  do you know 18 year olds ? 
  when i was at that age we were even more edgy ( look at my username ) .
