sorry , it 's late , but of course you 're totally right . 
  i did n't even mean to disagree with you , i know what it 's like to learn a foreign language , and of course one needs to know the rules . 
  your statement just caught my attention because i make my living with german texts , and i 'm surrounded by grammar nazis ( not all of them native speakers ) who insist that their preferred version is the only correct one , even though that 's totally not the case , and i 'm kind of allergic to that . 
  also , i was a bit drunk . 
  i apologize , 
  this is some very good advice , and op shoul definitley follow it . 
  as a native speaker , i disagree with on thing :  second of all , while they know the language by heart , the great majority do not really have grammar knowledge . 
  ask a person why a thing is like this or like that and they will probably not have a good answer to it . 
  native speakers of any language always have a better grammar knowledge than anyone else , including textbooks . 
  you should always trust a native speaker , even if their point is counterintuitive and they ca n't explain it . 
  the thing is , grammar itself is n't logical in a mathematical way . 
  more often than not , you wo n't find a reason as to why something is the way it is , you simply have to accept it . 
  if you always look for logical explanations , odds are you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  this goes for any language , by the way . 
  apart from that , great post . 
  yes , i agree that she 's an imposition . 
  if her actions are against the law , the law should be enforced . 
  my point is that it should n't matter whose granddaughter she is . 
  she 's not the man himself after all , she should be judged solely by her own actions . 
  not that i 'm fond of her , but how could you deny mussolini 's granddaughter the right to get into politics ? 
  depends on the statistics . 
  if you go by deaths per journey , planes [ do n't appear that safe anymore ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aviation_safety#statistics ) . 
  [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.de/learn-german/s-2469 ) has some free courses and other materials . 
  also , check out / r/lanl _ german !, 
  yes , i was n't trying to diss him , i have no problem with that . 
  there are really a lot of poland-related articles on en.wikipedia , you can see it on [ this map ] ( http://toolserver.org/%7erender/toolkit/wikimap/index.php?lang=en ) . 
  iirc , some polish guy created thousands of them with a bot once . 
  in germany there was [ an incident with a flock of sheep ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/eisenbahnunfall_im_landr%fcckentunnel ) once . 
  some twenty sheep were enough to derail a high speed train . 
  they had been driven onto the track by a dog . 
   basically everything outside of europe , besides cold war and colonization the history of the us was covered in our english lessons . 
   [ ( 1 ) whosoever insults a foreign head of state , or , with respect to his position , a member of a foreign government who is in germany in his official capacity , or a head of a foreign diplomatic mission who is accredited in the federal territory shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three years or a fine , in case of a slanderous insult to imprisonment from three months to five years . 
  ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0993 ) hence , the question is not whether he protested the us government , but whether he insulted the ambassador . 
  you can still protest any government anytime you want and you wo n't be arrested . 
  you can probably even insult obama as long as he 's not in germany in his official capacity . 
  i guess obama could sue you for defamation though . 
   should n't freedom of speech allow this kind of opinions , especially if it 's about an organization or foreign government and not about a person ? 
  of course this kind of * opinion * is allowed . 
  freedom of speech has its boundaries though , and this is one of them , apparently . 
  is this how it * should * be ? 
  well , open to debate , i guess . 
  note that it could only be considered an insult to the ambassador because it was projected onto the us embassy . 
  on any other building , it would have been okay . 
   why i have no idea . 
  broadsheet newspaper , centre-left , the english website features mostly reportages . 
  edit : also , http://www.worldcrunch.com/ translates articles from many different european papers . 
  you 're quite the optimist if you think the cdu are the only ones to blame here . 
  the spd was in government from 1998 to 2009 , do you really think they were n't involved in this ? 
  that 's because it 's not really folk music , it 's shitty pop music that caters to the same demographic as garden gnomes and electric blankets . 
   i believe it is possible to predict someone 's behaviour based on their ethnicity this depends a lot on the definition of ethnicity . 
  some are aware of [ the scientific concept ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnicity ) , others use the term as a euphemism for `` race '' . 
  i do n't think you will get any meaningful result out of this . 
  maybe you want to check out [ the weekly news thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ggxig/sunday_european_news_series_what_happened_in_your/ ) . 
  that 's a weird stereotype you have there , the majority tends to think the common berliner does n't want a job . 
  a lot of concentration camps are memorials today and can be visited . 
  it 's not just because of the neo-nazis . 
  you 've got to keep in mind that this was done by the government of the gdr , which actively tried to sweep remnants of the nazi past under the rug . 
  they never dealt with the past like the west did , and they had a lot of former nazis in responsible positions , which was a taboo topic of course . 
  turning hitler 's bunkers into a museum in the middle of east berlin was totally out of the question for them , the more noiselessly the could get rid of them , the better . 
  if these bunkers had outlasted the fall of the berlin wall , the subject would 've been handled differently . 
  taksim square is in europe . 
  only 30 results on google , there must be a mistake somewhere in there . 
  i think it 's hard to argue that we get milked as long as those developments are supported by a majority of the populace . 
  if anything , we 're deliberately milking ourselves . 
  it 's a survey by emnid , one of the leading opinion polling companies in germany . 
  of course it was commissioned by someone , but do you really think they would put their scientific reputation at risk by skewing results for `` ausgestrahlt '' ? 
  if you know a survey with different results , feel free to share it , even if it was commissioned by vattenfall . 
  51 % would want to phase out even faster . 
  well , we wo n't agree here . 
  democracy . 
  the nuclear phase-out was a democratic decision and those who do n't like it have to comply with it . 
  every single law is like that . 
  the eu is complaining because it believes the practice distorts competition , this has little to to do with what customers want . 
  this being said , of course nobody was enthusiastic about higher energy prices , but everybody knew they would come if germany made the switch . 
  the majority supported it nevertheless . 
  energy is energy , there 's no such thing as inferior or superior electricity . 
  also , customers were n't exactly `` forced '' to pay higher prices , the majority of them wanted the switch , otherwise it would n't have happened in the first place . 
  are you in solitary confinement ? 
  that 's nice , but you should also give the asian ones a shot , they come with reincarnation . 
  if volker kauder got his way , we 'd probably also ban crescent moons and che guevara t-shirts . 
  in this case it would be `` bedankt voor je hulp '' , the european language is quite confusing . 
  not much going on there . 
  a relatively small and ugly town ( ~ 60.000 inhabitants ) in the middle of nowhere . 
  [ commie blocks ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/slubice_-_frankfurt_\\ ( oder \\ ) . jpg ) and [ empty streets ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/ffo_04-13_brunnenplatz.jpg ) . 
  as greatlinguist pointed out , it is possible to commute from berlin and i know some people who do it , but it means you have to sacrifice up to three hours a day for the train ride , depending on where you live in berlin . 
  if you 're willing to do that , it 's probably okay . 
  thanks a lot , i 'll definitely see what i can find when i have access to scientific journals . 
  i was n't aware of this aspect of censorship , it 's really interesting . 
  i 'd love to read up on these compulsory musical theory tests , could you recommend a book or some website ? 
  the biggest downside of picking german is that frankfurt ( oder ) is probably the least interesting city on the list . 
  it 's probably onomatopoetic , all five names imitate the english pronunciation . 
  my guess would be that while the bigger countries with gu\u00f3 have proper names in chinese , the smaller ones merely retain their english names . 
  also , right-hand traffic . 
  that looks german to me . 
  conrad is polish/english . 
  if you 're looking for another writer from the eurozone , [ joyce ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/revolutionary_joyce_better_contrast.jpg ) would be classy . 
  i have `` made in heaven '' on a queen cd that was actually made in holland . 
  yeah , but uli hoene\u00df is system-relevant . 
  too big to fail . 
  well , i do n't know anything about konrad adam , i just stumbled across this a few days ago when it was posted on another subreddit .
