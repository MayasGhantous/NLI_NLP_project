  my personal opinion that others will certainly disagree with : die welt is not necessarily a paper that lends integrity to its journalists . 
  it 's the mainstream outlet of axel springer , the publishing house that also publishes bild , the german equivalent of the daily mail . 
  while it 's generally accepted as a conservative/liberal paper , it has a penchant for populism , so it 's not entirely surprising to find an article like that there . 
  now germany has a bunch of right-wingers that have repeatedly tried to establish themselves in the mainstream in recent years . 
  they 've founded parties like [ pro deutschland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pro_germany_citizens'_movement ) and [ die freiheit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_freedom_party ) , both of which were debunked pretty fast , and they 've tried to hijack others , like the pirates in their early days . 
  afd seems to be their most recent attempt . 
  personally , i do n't believe that the economists who started the party belong to that bunch , but they 've certainly attracted it , and we 'll see whether they can ward it off . 
  it does n't look like they 're trying too hard , to be honest . 
  i do n't know where konrad adam stands , but the boundaries are fluid anyway . 
  he 's probably referencing [ this ] ( http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article159946/wer-soll-waehlen.html ) article by konrad adam , one of the party 's chairmen . 
  it 's not an official party policy . 
  the question whether afd are , in fact , right-wing populists in disguise is a major point of debate at the moment . 
  they are denying it , but many of their members and supporters stem from the scene . 
  another chairman , stefan milkereit , had to step down after making racist comments on twitter . 
  no worries , i was n't trying to provide scientific proof for anything ;-), 
  for anyone still wondering who is actually stupid and who is not : wikipedia traffic in april for `` czech republic '' : [ english ] ( http://stats.grok.se/en/201304/czech%20republic ) - [ german ] ( http://stats.grok.se/de/201304/tschechien ) - [ italian ] ( http://stats.grok.se/it/201304/repubblica%20ceca ) - [ polish ] ( http://stats.grok.se/pl/201304/czechy ) . 
  we also beat everyone in looking up `` tahiti '' on the day of the haiti earthquake : [ en ] ( http://stats.grok.se/en/201001/tahiti ) - [ de ] ( http://stats.grok.se/de/201001/tahiti ) . 
  try harder , rest of the world !, 
  it 's the west , and it 's mainly nostalgia . 
  so the telegraph apparently gets its info from [ reddit comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1cknjz/eastwest_berlin_divide_still_visible_from_space/c9hifbc ) these days . 
  unfortunately , the guy is wrong , the gas lamps are actually the white ones in the west . 
  also , a guy who plagiarized 70 % of his thesis . 
   a person from the diaspora would also never admit that he/she has a good life in sweden , germany or whatever . 
  they always say how their life is hard work , they have many credits to pay back , and that the life is only work and sleep in the diaspora . 
  to be fair , that 's probably true for many of them . 
   pinochet died in 1990 oh come on guardian , you can do better than that . 
  we have a forum like that in germany , '' [ parliamentwatch ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliamentwatch ) '' . 
  some politicians ( including chancellor candidate steinbr\u00fcck ) boycott it , others try to fob everyone off with truisms , but generally it works quite nicely . 
  looks like she was just a bit dumbfounded , the [ bubble burst quickly ] ( http://static.euronews.com/articles/220284/600x338_0804-merkel-putin-laughter-femen.jpg ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/station_hertzienne_militaire_de_pierre-sur-haute ) is the article in question . 
  it has been translated into six languages today . 
  no conspiracy here , i 'm afraid . 
  bonn nowadays is pretty much * some random german city * . 
  well , it 's not breaking news that the prices may rise , but the nuclear phase-out was a democratic decision and is still supported by the electorate . 
  germany is not the best place build them since it only has a small part of the alps , which is relatively densely populated . 
  the plan is to revamp the grid and look for storage capacity elsewhere , like [ norway ] ( http://www.dw.de/can-norway-help-germany-store-green-energy/a-16050689 ) . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.cedren.no/news/article/tabid/3599/articleid/1079/can-norway-be-europe-s-green-battery.aspx#hvordan_er__konomien ) shows some scenarios . 
  i admire your enthusiasm but it 's a bit detached from reality . 
  that 's really just a minor nuisance for the investors . 
  there will probably be some graffiti and vandalism , but anger disperses over time . 
  they did , but the authority apparently gave its consent . 
   yeah , those articles in eu legislation do exist and that 's why they are mentioned . 
  but that 's not the actual regulation which starts from page two at the point : has adopted this regulation yep , my mistake , it 's actually article 2 , point 3 :  each consignment of the products referred to in article 1 shall be accompanied by a declaration , attesting that [ ... ] in case the product is originating from the prefectures fukushima , gunma , ibaraki , tochigi , miyagi , yamagata , niigata , nagano , yamanashi , saitama , tokyo and chiba , the product does not contain levels of the radionuclides iodine-131 , caesium-134 and caesium-137 above the maximum levels provided for in council regulation ( euratom ) no 3954/87 of 22 december 1987 , commission regulation ( euratom ) no 944/89 of 12 april 1989 and commission regulation ( euratom ) no 770/90 of 29 march 1990 . 
  it did n't originate on lawblog by the way , it was pointed out by foodwatch and umweltinstitut m\u00fcnchen , as lawblog states . 
  edit : sorry , forgot that : [ here 's ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2008:201:0001:0007:en:pdf ) the regulation that was in place before 25th of march . 
  the maximum levels for caesium are regulated in article 2 , 2a . 
  as you can see , they are indeed 370 bq/kg for milk and milk products , 600 bq/kg for all other products . 
  after the march 25th regulation , they were 400 ( baby food ) , 1000 ( milk products ) , 1250 ( other products ) . 
  how is that not an increase ? 
   yes it does . 
  please demonstrate where does that regulation increase radiation limits and how . 
  first page , point ( 3 ) :  maximum levels have been established by council regulation ( euratom ) no 3954/87 of 22 december 1987 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency ( 2 ) , commission regulation ( euratom ) no 944/89 of 12 april 1989 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in minor foodstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency ( 3 ) and commission regulation ( euratom ) no 770/90 of 29 march 1990 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency ( 4 ) . 
  council regulation ( euratom ) no 3954/87 of 22 december 1987 is [ this one ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/873954_en.pdf ) . 
  the maximum levels are in the annex , they 're exactly the ones lawblog mentions . 
  point ( 4 ) renders them applicable according to [ council decision 87/600/euratom of 14 december 1987 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radioprotection/doc/legislation/87600_en.pdf ) , exactly as lawblog mentions . 
  no urban myth there . 
   there is a contradiction : contrary to your claim the radiation limits were actually tightened as we all know . 
  perhaps you were unaware of it or for some other reason failed to mention it but it is of substance , do n't you agree ? 
  the regulation was in place as early as march 25th , as you can see . 
  your articles show that the commission announced to adjust them once again two weeks later . 
  i failed to mention it because i did indeed forget about this , but it makes it even worse imho . 
  basically , they put a regulation into place in order to increase the limits first , and two weeks later they announced to tighten it for safety reasons . 
  apparently without even mentioning that they had only been increased two weeks earlier for absurd reasons , at least your two articles fail to mention this . 
   at this point i honestly do n't get your joke . 
  is the joke that you failed to mention the tightened limits ? 
  i was n't joking , i called this practice a joke . 
  yes , the article i posted is from march 29th . 
  it references [ this regulation ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2011:080:0005:0008:en:pdf ) from march 25th . 
  two weeks later , the limits were changed again because the japanese limits were stricter , that 's what your articles are about . 
  no contradiction there , euobserver even mentions the earlier regulation . 
   the commission believes it would be correct to amend the present levels in force since march 25 as an additional safeguard measure quite a joke to raise them first and then widely announce to tighten them , if you ask me . 
  tea is great for the caffeine , it gets you wide awake , concentrated and calm at the same time , and it 's nearly impossible to overdose !, 
  that said , i like coffee too . 
  hey serbia , sorry to disappoint you but we already know this trick !, 
  the eu commission used it in 2011 after fukushima to [ increase the radiation limits on japanese food imports ] ( http://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lawblog.de%2findex.php%2farchives%2f2011%2f03%2f29%2feu-erhht-grenzwerte-fr-japanische-lebensmittel%2f&amp;act=url ) . 
  keep on trying though , next time you 'll surely beat us to it !, 
  greek frapp\u00e9 is the shit , we definitely need more of this here .

  we 're moving apart . 
  that 's because it 's so omnipresent that it 's really hard to escape . 
  at an early stage of language learning , you typically do n't have a feeling for different accents yet and just imitate what you hear . 
  british accents are adapted by students who went to britain or had a british teacher , everyone else is more likely to end up with an american-sounding accent . 
  seriously ? 
  an image , hosted on some dubious website , without any backstory or sources , submitted by someone who is clearly [ on a mission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/dansk_bds ) - and this shit gets upvoted ? 
  sauerkrautsaft is mainly used as a laxative . 
   sangria that 's the sweet stuff that gives you a hell of a headache , right ? 
  you clearly have n't mastered the craft , dude . 
  a proper drink tastes like a glass of bread !, 
  well , this is not decided by an institution , it 's a matter of market demand . 
  people request dubbed versions , thus they get dubbed versions . 
  you do n't need to convince me btw , i prefer subtitles . 
  it 's not about copyright but about royalties . 
  gema wants 0,375 cent per page view , and youtube refuses to pay . 
  instead , they are blocking videos gema might possibly be in charge of . 
  to be fair , both sides have n't covered themselves in glory in this dispute . 
  i 'm by no means a fan of gema and their bullshit practices , but it is a bit fishy how google has managed to come off as the good guy in the public opinion . 
  they are after all an american company that just walked in and refused to abide the national law , however shitty that law might be . 
  like everything else , the definition of `` catholic '' is not carved in stone , it changes all the time . 
  apart from that , a `` new life '' has n't formed yet , the morning-after pill is a contraceptive , as is clearly said in the article .
