  the one thing i do n't like about subtitles is that i tend to frantically read them even when i can understand the movie just fine , but that 's just me i guess . 
  out of habit , i guess . 
  when you 're used to dubbing , you experience subtitles as inconvenient . 
  older people are less likely to accept inconveniences . 
  especially when they probably get less advantages out of it since their foreign language skills do n't suffice . 
  yeah , no offense taken , i just felt this point belonged here !, 
  as a south german who 's been living in berlin for ten years now , i can assure you it runs both ways . 
  i 'm fairly unemotional about the topic , but i think a lot of people tend to oversimplify the problem with the economy a bit . 
  ( inb4 , i 'm * not * unemployed ;-) it 's absolutely true that berlin 's economic situation is horrible , that there are serious problems with the integration of immigrants and all that . 
  it 's also absolutely true that many of these problems are due to the fact that our politics are a mess , and that a lot of bad decisions have been made , and probably will be made in the future . 
  the city could definitely be better off if we got our shit together and found a way to deal with these issues . 
  there 's also another dimension to this though . 
  berlin tends to attract a very special crowd - mostly young people with little money who come here to study , to party , or simply to get away from where they come from and live in the big city . 
  a lot of them leave again at some point in order to get a job , because there 's simply not a lot of jobs here . 
  the thing is , those people would n't disappear from the face of the earth if berlin was different . 
  they 'd simply go somewhere else and cost money there . 
  berlin does n't create those people , it simply gathers them in one place . 
  personally , i think it 's wrong to judge this approach to life . 
  besides the fact that it simply exists and we need to deal with it , society as a whole also profits from it . 
  it results in a great cultural life , it sets free creativity , and it provides young people who feel they `` just do n't fit in '' somehow with a chance to find their way after all . 
  the german society can afford this , and i think it should support it . 
  culture is about more than just the economy , and we 're in the lucky situation to be able to uphold it . 
  while it looks like a berlin issue , it relates to the whole country in the end , and i think we can appreciate it and * not * just think of the city as a shithole full of losers . 
  the latter . 
  neo-nazis refer to the dresden bombing as `` bomb holocaust '' , which is frequently followed by holocaust denial and/or an attempt to blame the war on the allies . 
  the mayor of dresden is basically distancing herself from this line of thought , which is considered necessary in public speeches on the topic . 
  there is actually [ a new one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_safe_confinement ) being built . 
  it was supposed to be finished by 2005 at first , but the construction work was postponed time and again . 
  they finally started in 2012 and plan to be done by 2015 now . 
  this here has nothing to do with the sarcophagus though , [ here 's ] ( http://www.chnpp.gov.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=315%3a2013-02-12-17-04-25&amp;catid=28%3anssreports&amp;lang=en ) pictures that show the actual damage . 
  yes , i 've understood that . 
  my point was rather that it 's up to the electorate to deal with that , not to the eu , as lurkson1stdates was suggesting . 
  how should the eu stop this ? 
  people have every right to protest anything they want after all . 
  i would n't be surprised if that changed now . 
  with this example being set , resignation will always be considered a possibility in the future . 
  your reforms [ will not end well ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prophecy_of_the_popes ) . 
  it 's [ the one smiley_x mentioned ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_prayer_ ( video \\ ) ) , so apparently it was made by an ultra-nationalist organisation , but aired on the public tv station . 
  [ this is the creepiest thing i 've seen today . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iagwr-a8u84#t=3m39s ), 
  was that a joke or are you not familiar with [ the phrase ] ( http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/to+go+out+of+one's+way.html ) ? 
  i generally tip nothing when i 'm being served by the boss . 
  i 've been taught that this could be considered condescending , but i 've heard different opinions on that one . 
  western media like al jazeera ? 
  so what is your source ? 
   [ according to the preliminary version of the annual report of germany 's interior intelligence service ( verfassungsschutz ) for 2010 , at the time there were 25,000 right-wing extremists living in germany , including 5,600 neo-nazis . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-nazism#germany ), 
  i hate corruption too , corruption in football simply does n't have the highest priority on my list though . 
  it 's nothing like corruption in politics imho , it 's more like corruption in the eurovision song contest or something . 
  i 'm going to deal with it when i have done away with all the other problems in the world , but maybe i 'm going to have a cup of tea first . 
  and watch some football while i 'm at it . 
  hey , i 'm not even arguing with you because i happen to agree with most ( though not all ) of your points . 
  i was merely trying to explain that it 's possible to hate all this and still enjoy a good game . 
  ( okay , it 's probably not possible when you think * everything * is fixed . ), 
  you seem to care a lot more about it than i do , by the way . 
  yeah well , nobody was defending corruption here , and as you can see , there are investigations going on . 
  i think it used to be possible until now to believe that , while fifa was corrupt as fuck , the teams were n't . 
  there were some scandals on a national or regional level which did indeed have consequences ( a club in italy was relegated for example ) , but nothing indicated a big network , so it was entirely possible to watch the games and ignore the politics in the meantime . 
  we 'll see what comes of this now . 
  as for the being lied to , i 'm not entirely sure that 's a problem for everyone . 
  people even watch things like wrestling , which is staged * by definition * . 
  or look at the tour de france . 
  all the doping that was going on is a media scandal , but it 's not really a surprise . 
  people who were into the sport suspected it all along , but it was only ruined when the facade could n't be maintained any longer . 
  the boundaries between competition and spectacle are fluid , and being lied to in a convincing manner will always have its charm , i guess . 
  the thing is , people do n't want their money back , they want football . 
  agreed , i just think `` why do we care '' takes us in the wrong direction . 
  it 's necessary to draw attention to the issue in the first place . 
  like it or not , the majority of people ca n't develop empathy for unknown victims somewhere else in the world , they need faces they can relate to . 
  that 's why the pussy riots and kasparovs are so important , not because they are superior or something . 
  it has always been this way , and it wo n't change in the foreseeable future . 
  i 've also seen memes upvoted here . 
  this will probably get more frequent with ever more subscribers . 
  when i checked a few hours ago , there was a highly upvoted joke on the front page which has apparently been removed now . 
  `` well , it 's not as funny as i remembered it to be . '', 
  [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20958353 ) made the news just a few days ago . 
  not available in my country , that 's why we go abroad to acquire disco skills i guess . 
  those are the ones that need entertainers and aerobic instructors though .

  i do n't know a lot about scots , but its structure and grammar is derived from old english , is n't it ? 
  different influences occured in all languages , but they do n't necessarily affect the classification . 
  the english language exchanged 40 % of its vocabulary for french at one point , but it 's still regarded as a germanic language . 
  so the queen 's husband is called prince , but the king 's wife is called queen ? 
  duden used to be an official standard until 1996 , nowadays it 's just a private publishing house without a special status . 
  the `` official '' rules are made by the [ council for german orthography ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/council_for_german_orthography ) , which has councillors from all german speaking countries ( and in which no single country holds a majority ) . 
  duden and the other dictionaries do n't always follow their rules , and neither do they always agree with each other . 
  i also would n't agree with `` germans are not that strict with their language '' . 
  i 've yet to see a people with such a bizarre amount of grammar nazis , especially after the spelling reform ;-), 
  never trust duden though , nowadays they 're basically just a private publishing house with a strong opinion . 
  in this case , the truth is [ we have n't decided yet ] ( http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?word1=googlen&amp;word2=googeln ) . 
  no way this was done from memory . 
  you cheated , did n't you ? 
  it 's there , next to lithuania . 
  and we have a winner for the most accurate depiction of the balkans . 
  that 's the price you pay for finally getting a beach !, 
  this will probably lead to the euro being played in the same cities that already host the champions league . 
  well it 's good to know where those guys are , do n't you think so ? 
  there was also a neo-nazi youth movement in the gdr which opposed the state and its values just like the left-wingers did in the west . 
  given that youth movements are usually more prominent in cities than in rural regions , this might have influenced the distribution too , but i 'm just guessing . 
  i 'm pretty sure everyone with a basic interest in art knows miro .
