  who was indeed born in austria-hungary . 
  does n't matter that much in the end , kafka simply belongs to prague . 
  nobody talks about wasting it on purpose . 
  and , yes , there 's areas with no abundance of water . 
  the thing is : i ca n't help those areas by being overly thrifty about my own water . 
  if i could , i would . 
  now i could still follow that course out of respect for those who die of thirst , as you 're suggesting . 
  that 's a legitimate standpoint , and i can definitely see where you 're coming from , but sorry , i do n't share it . 
  it does n't help anyone , it even causes harm . 
  as i said , i prefer to be pragmatic about these issues . 
  there 's so many decisions to make that can actually make a difference that i refuse to waste my time on those that do n't matter in the end . 
  i 'm not going to save water to feel myself better , when it does n't help anyone and only causes problems with the pipes . 
  [ seems to be some weird meme ] ( http://doggen.spreadshirt.de/norway-great-dane-3c-dogge-i6753320 ) . 
  point given , different countries have different problems . 
  in the end , there 's nothing to fight about - saving water is apparently neither universally right nor universally wrong , so we do n't need to come to a conclusion on that . 
  saving water leads to all those problems too , as it causes pipe blockage .

  saving energy and materials is reasonable , the obsession with saving water rather smells like some kind of fetish though . 
  that does n't mean i do n't appreciate the privilege of potable tap water , but let 's be pragmatic at least . 
   another thing is airconditioning - when i was working in place with air conditioning ( in a server room ) i was sick constantly ( it was very hot summer , 30c outside all the time , 18c in the server room ) . 
  most of my friends working there were also sick that summer . 
  so , basing on anegdotal evidence - it is n't healthy to have really big differences in air temperature . 
  this could also be due to mould and bacteria , air conditioners can spread them if they 're not kept clean . 
  do n't give them any ideas , we need bavaria to pay for the rest of us !, 
  cashiers are n't even allowed to accept it , and i think most people would find a 1 cent tip insulting anyway . 
  it 's just satire . 
  and no , it 's not very funny . 
  stuff like that happens every other day , though it does n't always appear in the new york times . 
  typical berlin circlejerk , but some folks do take the issue way too seriously . 
  i 'm pretty sure that jews are n't allowed to eat horse meat either . 
  is starbucks considered coffee ? 
  it 's probably hard to get because the amount of caffeine in tea varies widely depending on type and brewing method . 
  also , its effects on the body are different from those of the caffeine in coffee . 
  i 'm not familiar with their customs . 
  feel free to crosspost , i did n't create it . 
  he used welsh and finnish afaik . 
  they 're tracing it back to russian for some reason . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vojvodina#name ) goes back to proto-slavic , which seems to make more sense . 
  well , finishing the cologne cathedral took 600 years too . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poet/item/2455/20/kiki-dimoula ) some english translations . 
  i know ( and like ) danilo ki\u0161 and will definitely check out the other recommendations , thanks to all of you !, 
  brilliant and absolutely unique writer , one of the best of our times imho . 
  i would n't be surprised at all if he were awarded the nobel prize one day , he should fit in quite well with the commitee 's tendencies . 
  you must have had a good curriculum then , i do n't even remember all the dull stuff i had to read in german lessons . 
  i think part of the problem with ulysses is that everyone talks about how difficult it is all the time , but does n't mention that it can actually be fun to read . 
  a more recent book i 'd also recommend is `` the tower '' by [ uwe tellkamp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uwe_tellkamp ) , a monumental novel about the fall of the gdr . 
  i think it still indicates that something is worth reading . 
  whether one actually ends up enjoying it is a different question , but you can also gain from good books you do n't like . 
  this list definitely needs some beckett !, 
  `` waiting for godot '' would be the obvious choice , but personally i like his novels even better - '' [ murphy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murphy_ ( novel \\ ) ) '' was a great starting point for me , and the trilogy ( `` molloy '' / `` malone dies '' / `` the unnameable '' ) is one of my all time favourites . 
  just reading `` the bridge on the drina '' , awesome book !, 
  i 'd love to get more serbo-croatian recommendations . 
  even though they may not be as great as the classics , is there a more recent novel i should give a try ? 
  do n't forget robert musil !, 
  [ the man without qualities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_man_without_qualities ) is up there with joyce and proust imho . 
  and that 's probably what the swiss do n't like about us . 
  i think the degree varies among different regions though . 
  berlin is definitely more `` asking '' than the south . 
  personally i feel that cities should be in the hands of those who live in them . 
  the russians in kaliningrad have every right to be there today , even though their forefathers committed crimes . 
  all our forefathers committed crimes . 
  we 're in a luxurious situation now though : most germans , russians , brits , etc. 
  who are alive today have n't committed crimes against each other , and thus have no personal reason to bear any grudges . 
  this seems like a very good moment to accept the status quo . 
  you 're right of course , there 's a lot more attached to it . 
  however , when we talk about `` losing land '' , what we 're effectively talking about is borders , and those are n't what they used to be , as we all know . 
  the people suffered a lot , but mourning after the lost land is generally not very popular here . 
  it used to be a major issue when most of the [ `` heimatvertriebene '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heimatvertriebene ) were still alive , but by now their voice is slowly fading , and i doubt that many folks are going to miss it . 
  besides , any german who wants to live there can go there nowadays , who 's going to stop them ? 
  i 'm convinced that [ putin ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/__w_ckhxdjzi/so3rv0-vghi/aaaaaaaaami/aznsoyxhlym/s400/vladimir-putin-hunting-with-rifle.jpg ) has a heart for elephants . 
  kaliningrad was part of the [ russian sfsr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_sfsr ) , while what is now latvia was the [ latvian ssr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_ssr ) . 
  after the ussr fell apart , both became distinct sovereign countries . 
  so basically , kaliningrad was a part of russia which was a part of the ussr . 
  today , the ussr does n't exist anymore , but kaliningrad is still a part of russia . 
  i ca n't speak for all of europe , but i do n't have the impression . 
  for some reason i associate them with old ladies . 
  an angel !, 
  may i also introduce you to the [ jahresendfl\u00fcgelfigur ] ( http://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fjahresendfl%c3%bcgelfigur&amp;act=url ) ? 
  probably [ this one ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/04/spain-columbine ) . 
  to tell the rest of the story afair : a german court [ issued an arrest warrant ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/international-extradition-order-in-el-masri-case-us-displeased-over-german-hunt-for-cia-agents-a-469884.html ) for the cia agents nevertheless , but the us declined to turn them in . 
  however , even though they were not brought before the court , the agents are pretty much useless for the cia now , as interpol searches for them . 
  i think el-masri then sued the german government for not taking further steps , but i 'm not sure what came of it . 
  i 'd still like to see a comparison to the effects of alcohol though . 
  i 'm pretty sure the number of people who die because others drank too much is n't negligible either . 
  did they really ? 
  from what i gather , he was only held in custody and `` questioned '' there , before he was handed over to the cia . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/28/world/20101128-cables-viewer.html?scp=1&amp;sq=07berlin242.html&amp;st=cse#report/cables-07berlin242 ), 
  remember they did n't sentence the cia here but the macedonian government , which did n't torture him in afghanistan . 
  oh germany , you so embarrasing on reddit . 
  that 's not what `` we '' do . 
  speak for yourself , man . 
  sorry for raping your language . 
  a friend of mine just invited me and a couple of other guys to see the new year in amsterdam , that 's pretty cool !, 
  indeed , it 's not even necessary to tell irishmen from italians anymore :d, 
  prosit to you , and have a pint for me too !, 
  i 've just finished my work and now i 'll have to go out into the drizzle to get some groceries . 
  ca n't wait for the weekend !, 
  how is yours ? 
  totally fine with me .
