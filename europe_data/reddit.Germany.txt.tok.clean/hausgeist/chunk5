  twenty years ago we used to talk about the weather with our neighbour . 
  now we talk about the weather with the rest of the continent . 
  progress is a wonderful thing . 
  gays are allowed to adopt children in greece ? 
  especially towards japan , there 's almost nothing . 
  he was probably downvoted because he did n't answer op 's question . 
  depends on what you 're trying to achieve . 
  if they wanted to get elected into parliament , their kind of reputation would probably not be desirable . 
  if their goal is to draw attention to their matters and to those opposing them , they are actually pretty succesful . 
  wow , now this is some brilliant real-life satire , so obviously the saints are okay but the halos are n't . 
  reminds one of socialist regimes trying to ban christian symbols . 
  come on people , we live in the 21st century . 
  thumbs up for secularism ( and atheism as far as i 'm concerned ) , but this is just cultural heritage , and it 's ludicrous to try to `` neutralize '' it . 
  look at [ all those depictions ] ( http://www.google.de/search?q=cyril+methodius&amp;hl=de&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=kfc&amp;channel=suggest&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=omoqupv1l9dctaag3igyaw&amp;ved=0cdiqsaq&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=893 ) of the saints , what do they have in common ? 
  doing away with legends and cultural heritage is clearly a smart move on the way to european integration . 
  the funniest aspect of this is that removing the halos does n't even change the religious connotation at all . 
  i hope they go for [ zeus ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/b/b6/2_euro_coin_gr_serie_1.png ) next , there 's no way he could transform into a bull and carry beautiful europa on his back !, 
  respect our neutralitah !, 
  * it 's okay to drink five cups of coffee a day , but do n't rely on everyone else buying it . 
  * we all shit in the toilet . 
  clean it every once in a while like everyone else does . 
  a whiny `` i do n't enjoy doing that '' is not an excuse . 
  * when you break something , it needs to be fixed . 
  who do you think is responsible for that ? 
  * when you masturbate in the bathtub , clean up afterwards . 
  if you do n't , please do n't take offense if someone tells you to do so . 
  if you forget about it again two days later , well fuck you too . 
  * we are not your parents . 
  when we agree something needs to be done , it 's probably not because we want to tease you , but because it needs to be done . 
  * do n't pull everyone 's cable out of the router and start downloading a 10 gb movie while you go to the gym . 
  * pay your fucking rent , we all know you have enough money . 
  hey , that 's [ our ] ( http://www.last-thursday.de/wp-content/uploads/last-thursday/2010/02/berlin-hunde2.jpg ) stereotype !, 
  i want to tell you that different ages had different stances of what 's okay in the first place . 
  people act according to the ideas they grew up with . 
  19th century people ( not only in britain , but pretty much everywhere ) grew up with the notion that racism was normal . 
  they did n't even have a word for it . 
  weimar germans did * not * grow up with the notion that nazism and extermination camps were normal . 
  you ca n't hold people from completely different ages and regions to the same standards . 
  colonialism was not widely regarded as a questionable ideology in the 19th century ; there was no way a majority of people would even oppose it , let alone start a revolution . 
  if you accuse them for holding these views , it only shows that you know little about the mindset of victorian england and are merely judging from a position that 's prevalent in 2012 germany . 
  it 's called [ presentism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presentism_ ( literary_and_historical_analysis \\ ) ) . 
  weimar germany is a different case . 
  they had a democracy and they chose to abolish it . 
  french people grow up too slowly . 
  i 've had three french flatmates ( in their twenties ) and none of them was able to get done what fucking needs to be done , it did n't even occur to them . 
  that 's simply a matter of national law , nations handle citizenship differently . 
  it does n't have a general connection to the concept of ethnicity . 
  berlin has always been fucked up economically , our mayor once called it `` poor , but sexy '' , and that 's pretty much how it is perceived in germany . 
  it attracts a lot of young people with little money ( students , artists , general hipsters ) and has hardly any big industries . 
  historically this has a lot to do with its special status during the cold war . 
  east berlin was ( de facto ) part of the gdr of course , while west berlin was an enclave , which was n't exactly appealing to big companies . 
  young people from west germany often went to west berlin during the cold war because it was a was a way to escape conscription , and that helped establish the artsy , sub-cultural image it still has . 
  heavily depressed people do n't think or act that way . 
  that 's part of the disease . 
  yes , some do , and some do n't . 
  yeah , but it 's the main reason you can not assume that someone who jumps in front of a train is acting deliberately or `` fucking retarded '' . 
  i 'm happy for you that you have n't encountered depression yet . 
  he goes to considerable length just to draw an overall anti-american picture that dismisses all the details that a serious discussion would need to take into account . 
  it 's like he 's deliberately holding his binoculars the wrong way round . 
  i have no problem with polemicizing , but when you arrive at a point where you say it does n't make a difference for us whether obama or romney gets elected , you 're just being cynical , and wrong . 
  he has every right to be so , but i think it 's `` not helpful '' , as angela merkel would put it . 
  i prefer pragmatic approaches to big problems , no matter what ideological corner they come from . 
  if he were a private person , i 'd call his approach bigoted ; as he 's a political journalist , i call it populist . 
  he 's not a regular spiegel editor , but he deputizes for his family , which holds 24 % of the publishing house . 
  that 's not exactly what i would call an external either . 
  i 'd say it 's a typical piece by [ jakob augstein ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jakob_augstein ) . 
  basically , he uses current events to remind the german left of its general mistrust towards the usa . 
  it 's more an expression of his own ideological stance than an actual comment on american politics . 
  being a left-leaning german myself , unsubstanciated stuff like that always annoys me - it has a very efficient way to overlay serious political discourse . 
  til american greens use the logo of bp . 
  the trick-or-treaters will know how to make you acknowledge realities when the time has come in your city . 
  i 've been washing awful-smelling stuff off my door for three years in a row now . 
  i consider supplying them with [ this shit ] ( http://shop.edna.de/webroot/edna/shops/edna/products/90008/90008_m.jpg ) this year , seems like an appropriate way to get back at them . 
   jewish/israeli are often used interchangeably . 
  that 's a major part of the problem . 
  that 's what the who is for , [ here ] ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html ) is their report on tb . 
  it does n't help though if the affected people are n't treated properly or even refuse treatment , as the article mentions . 
  that 's more of a social/political problem . 
  it 's easy to blame the corporations , but i think at the end of the day this is a systemic problem . 
  for-profit corporations ca n't be expected to develop drugs on their own expense , it 's simply not part of their responsibility according to market logic . 
  at some point public funding has to come into play . 
  if the governments choose not to fund the research themselves but leave it to the industry , there 's still the concept of [ advance market commitments ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/advance_market_commitments ) , that 's exactly what it was developed for afaik . 
  nice try [ gaddafi ] ( http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1926053,00.html ) . 
  the difference in population density is less striking when you focus on [ the european part ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_russia ) though . 
  27/km \u00b2 puts it [ ahead of all the nordic countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/area_and_population_of_european_countries ) . 
  when you go back to the cold war and count in all the countries the ussr held it 's even much higher . 
  of course , but that does n't contradict my statement . 
  extremists could n't rise if nobody listened to them . 
  i 'm sure there was a lot of radical muslims around in 2001 who would have taken offense as well , but it did n't affect the rest of the world . 
  only in the wake of the 9/11 attacs they got more media attention , and it suddenly became an issue for the rest of us . 
  they 're probably thankful for all the attention , and so are european islamophobes . 
  you ca n't abstract publicity from radicalization , that 's not how it works imho . 
  in that case it sucks for everyone , yes . 
  that 's why we mus n't let it come this far in the first place . 
  then again , kids of that age never cared much about jurisdiction . 
  the important thing is to educate rather than to stigmatize them , and that 's what society is responsible for . 
  teenagers are n't fully developed personalities yet , and if we leave it to their scumbag families to educate them , we 're at fault as well . 
  south park showed muhammad [ in 2001 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/super_best_friends ) and nobody cared . 
  the rise of extremism on both sides is actually a pretty young phenomenon . 
  they were , that 's why i deleted my comment too .
