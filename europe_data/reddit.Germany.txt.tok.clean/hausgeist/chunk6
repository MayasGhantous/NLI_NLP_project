  i deleted it because i messed up what i was trying to say , it was stupid . 
  edit : there was an answer ( where is it gone ? ), 
  that rightly pointed me to the concept of `` untermensch '' . 
  i know that , and i 'm aware of the [ nazi crimes against ethnic poles ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_crimes_against_ethnic_poles ) . 
  what i was talking about is the industrialized extermination of jews that is really unparalleled in history . 
  yes , it 's unfair , and i personally hold them in high regard . 
  it just seemed like the fastest way to make my point , sorry for trolling , 
  the problem with this argument is that it 's based on inherent qualities of a piece of art . 
  it 's always good to contemplate on art , but that 's nothing one can base court decisions on . 
  not even artists/critics/experts can agree on that . 
  there 's no objective way to tell a good/intelligent movie from a bad/stupid one , and it 's certainly not up to a judge to decide . 
  that 's why , when we accept monty python , we have to accept poop on jesus too . 
  you 're free to find stupid or offensive whatever you want , but it does n't matter for freedom of expression . 
  so would you say monty python were too stupid to formulate their ideas ? 
  i agree it 's stupid when it 's only done for provocation , but the thing about freedom of expression is , it does n't matter why it 's done . 
  once it 's out , it 's protected . 
  if we do n't want that anymore , we need to change the laws . 
  actually i woud n't recommend anything to everyone , but when you ask random people on the internet for their favorite films , you 're obviously willing to take chances . 
  ooh i forgot lars von trier . 
  [ the element of crime ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_element_of_crime ) and [ melancholia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melancholia_\\ ( 2011_film \\ ) ) are awesome too . 
  there 's no better way to spend 7.5 hours . 
  breathtaking imagery , atmosphere and characters , an entirely unique approach to cinema . 
  everything else by b\u00e9la tarr as well , but s\u00e1t\u00e1ntang\u00f3 is the place to start , even though it takes its time . 
  if russia counts , [ stalker ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stalker_\\ ( 1979_film \\ ) ) is the way to go . 
  best german movies imho : [ fitzcarraldo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fitzcarraldo ) , [ aguirre - the wrath of god ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aguirre,_the_wrath_of_god ) , [ the lives of others ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_lives_of_others ) edit for haneke . 
  [ the white ribbon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_white_ribbon ) , [ cach\u00e9 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cach\u00e9_ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  brilliant . 
  there 's also [ deutsche welle ] ( http://dw.de/ ) and [ radio france international ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/ ) , comparable to bbc world service . 
  to be honest , as someone who earns his living with the writing of ( german ) texts , i 've always envied you native english speakers for that . 
  a lot of continental europeans are under the impression that it 's somehow the state 's job to regulate language up to ridiculous levels , and what can i say , it does n't yield great results . 
  at best , it only slows down the natural development that every language takes , at worst , it really makes people insecure in regard to their own mother tounge . 
  it also leads to the rise of an absurd amount of grammar nazis that dedicate decades of their lives only to pointing out to people why they 're doing it `` wrong '' . 
  i really hope this drops out of fashion someday , but i doubt it . 
  uniformity is , sadly , overrated . 
  that 's exactly why i found this critique remarkable . 
  oh , i thought beppe grillo was their candidate . 
  why is n't he ? 
  right , who needs independent journalism anyway . 
  fuck you , i guess . 
  i did n't want to say it was worse than elsewhere , in fact i have no idea whether it is . 
  i 'm surely suffering perception bias as well . 
  by the way , my grandpa ( who was driven out of czech republic ) talked bad about dem czechs for all his life , until he visited the country for the first time this year - and came to the conclusion that they run the country much better than messy me would , which i found hilarious . 
  while i ( fellow german ) totally agree with your comment , i think the `` older generation '' type of argument is also a part of the problem . 
  it would overall be better if we could simply admit that there 's a lot of racism , xenophobia , and stereotyping in our country , and that poles , for example , are clearly victims of this . 
  i have n't been around here for long , but it 's obvious to me that a lot of germans on reddit ( and other international sites ) love to dwell in the feeling that they are not considered the bad guys anymore , and accept all the pats on the back with pleasure . 
  to me , this is more ridiculous than problematic , but it tends to establish an impression of moral superiority that is counterproductive . 
  no one likes being called a racist , and especially not by a group of people that behaves this way . 
  it 's true that our own stereotyping is more prevalent with older people , but that 's probably the case in every other country as well . 
  let 's openly admit that we 're no better , and discussions will surely be easier and less hypocritical . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not accusing you and i totally think your comment is right , i just think `` we '' should keep that in mind . 
  it 's not really odd , the notion that gays are pedophiles and pose a threat to `` our children '' is one of the most common stereotypes . 
  in case someone else is searching as well : [ statistics ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/specialist/statistics/index_en.htm ) ( in the charts & figures section ) . 
  also , you sound charming even when you swear . 
  you 're right of course , i was n't trying to imply that . 
  my point was that it 's worthwhile to keep in mind where oettinger comes from . 
  probably a neologism derived from the verb `` schl\u00fcpfen '' ( to slip ) . 
  background information on oettinger : he 's a german conservative , his party ( cdu ) used to be strictly pro-nuclear until fukushima turned around the public opinion . 
  furthermore , he was minister-president of the state of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg until 2010 . 
  a year later , the new elections coincided with the fukushima events , and the greens won the state for the first time . 
  well , that money does n't simply evaporate . 
  i 'm not familiar with their exact plans , but it * might * be a good investment to boost tourism and the local economy . 
  german race track hockenheimring brings in a 40 million revenue in the surrounding region with every single f1 race ( [ source in german ] ( http://www.handelsblatt.com/sport/motorsport/motorsport-formel1-boomzeiten-fuer-hockenheimring-sind-vorbei/2991544.html ) ) . 
  a bigger name , an amazing story , and a pinch of russian revolution : [ rasputin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rasputin ) . 
  i found [ this book ] ( http://books.google.de/books?id=3c4paaaacaaj&amp;dq=isbn:0806519711&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x-x5kmaggs&amp;sig=rtlrsdd4afr__gql4glfxt6sxeu&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=yrjquihrfctwtaaphogidw&amp;redir_esc=y ) worthwhile . 
  well , there was a world war . 
  it 's an unambiguous statement , he might as well wear a swastika . 
  still no reason to downvote you for asking a question . 
  antiziganism is even the technical term . 
  it makes sense though , it 's about the stereotypes that come along with `` zigeuner '' , not an actual ethnic group . 
  as far as i know , the acceptance of the term `` zigeuner '' among themselves depends on the actual group , whereas you ca n't do anything wrong with `` roma '' . 
  the common stereotypes are that they beg , steal , do n't work , and make no efforts to integrate into society . 
  also , drug dealing , small-time crime and family clans with arranged marriage . 
  positive stereotypes : wild , romantic , mysterious , good musicians . 
  also , they are psychics , and they can do magic . 
  was that what you 're looking for ? 
  have you really ever heard anyone else use that term ? 
  frankly , i 'm aware of the importance of non-discriminatory language , but this one goes too far . 
  roma is what they call themselves , there should be nothing wrong with that . 
  ianal , but [ the law ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__86a.html ) covers symbols of unconstitutional organisations as well as symbols that can be mistaken for them , so i guess it would n't make a difference . 
  fun fact : in 2007 , the german government [ tried to get the swastika banned across the eu ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6269627.stm ) and was stopped by british hindus amongst others . 
  is that game over for acapor , or can they appeal to a higher authority ? 
  evidence on what , the calendar ? 
  okay , your edit makes me assume you 're being sarcastic . 
  cool down , there 's nothing wrong about asking for sources on the internet . 
  there is an official investigation on the entanglement of officials and neo-nazis still going on . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10442799 ) is the most up-to-date english source i could find . 
  as for the police , i do n't know exactly what 38b0de is talking about , but there was a small scandal last year for example , when they released a calendar with racist cartoons like [ that one ] ( http://syndikalismus.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/polizeikalender.png ) . 
  i do n't think it 's about votes , though legalising nazi symbols today would probably be controversial of course . 
  the symbols were originally banned right after the end of the war by the allied forces , those laws are thus older than the state . 
  the german basic law merely took them over ( and i doubt there was much choice back then ) . 
  i agree that banning symbols is ridiculous , but in this case it 's simply the way history went . 
  it 's legal if you clearly distance yourself from nazi ideology . 
  an obvious satire will most likely not get you into any trouble ( or it might , but you 'll win in court ) . 
  just doing the nazi salute and then saying `` sorry , i was joking '' is probably not going to end well , though . 
  their way of handling this stuff is pretty retarded though . 
  they actually prosecuted dozens of people who wore [ this thing ] ( http://is1.myvideo.de/de/user_pics/283/pic_6148783_1226253477.png ) for `` use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations '' until a court stopped these shenanigans a few years ago . 
  ordinary moron . 
  please tell me where you live if you have n't seen one before . 
  the term `` islamic art '' was not coined by muslims , but by art historians , most of whom were probably westerners . 
  i agree that it 's problematic , but you should blame it on them .
