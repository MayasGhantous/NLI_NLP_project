  as the hours passed and sunday turned to monday , the prospect of a grexit seemed to grow more probable , participants said , heightening divisions between sleep-deprived politicians and diplomats that have developed over six months of mostly frustrating negotiations . 
  a senior official in the room believed that germany was now the country that appeared to be acting in bad faith -- no longer the greek prime minister alexis tsipras . 
  at one point , mr tsipras had to endure a lecture from miro cerar , the slovenian prime minister , to which italian prime minister matteo renzi objected . 
  eventually , fran\u00e7ois hollande , the french president who has battled to keep greece in the fold , ushered ms merkel and mr tsipras into mr tusk 's office to finalise a compromise on the privatisation fund . 
  although they were ultimately successful , the negotiations appeared to strain the franco-german relationship long at the heart of the european project . 
  `` there was in germany a rather strong pressure for a grexit . 
  i refused that solution , '' mr hollande told reporters after a deal was reached . 
  on the privatisation fund , in particular , mr hollande gave backing to mr tsipras . 
  it was a question of `` sovereignty , '' the french leader said . 
  `` nothing would have been worse than humiliating greece , greece did n't seek charity , but solidarity from the eurozone . '' mr hollande also insisted that the possibility of a temporary greek exit from the eurozone -- a controversial initiative mr sch\u00e4uble had managed to insert into the eurogroup proposals -- be removed from the final document . 
  in the end , some bleary-eyed diplomats emerged unsure who had prevailed in the marathon session . 
  but they seemed agreed as to who had suffered most . 
  `` they crucified tsipras in there , '' a senior eurozone official who had attended the summit remarked . 
  `` crucified . '',

  no , most of the `` bailout '' money was given to greek banks . 
  [ the latest report ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43044.0 ) states that it was successful until certain measures were not implemented by the ( new ) government :  at the last review in may 2014 , greece 's public debt was assessed to be getting back on a path toward sustainability , though it remained highly vulnerable to shocks . 
  by late summer 2014 , with interest rates having declined further , it appeared that no further debt relief would have been needed under the november 2012 framework , if the program were to have been implemented as agreed . 
  but significant changes in policies since then -- not least , lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization -- are leading to substantial new financing needs .

  no , sending the army against civilians in a non-war setting is just something no civilised nation does . 
  there are riot police units who are specialised in dealing with those situations .

  it 's just a populistic slogan . 
  history has already very clearly judged which kind of leader is `` better '' . 
  it 's also literally in the linked article :  in a time essay , gibbs said the magazine selected merkel `` for asking more of her country than most politicians would dare , for standing firm against tyranny as well as expedience and for providing steadfast moral leadership in a world where it is in short supply .

  sounds very positive to me in this case .
