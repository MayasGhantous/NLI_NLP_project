  correct , i read the article , you know ... 
   french police said that the car had no registration plates and it was found with its hazard lights flashing . 
  the vehicle contained seven gas cylinders , one of which was empty and placed on the front passenger seat . 
  there was no detonating device present , an official added . 
  la parisien reports that a book written in arabic was found at the scene . 
  that sounds completely stupid . 
  nearly like a prank . 
  why is this here ? 
  well , that 's the difference between anecdotes and surveys . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.news.com.au/national/queensland/crime/french-backpacker-shouted-allahu-akbar-during-fatal-home-hill-stabbing/news-story/2d6b0d75e4afb20d943ec9d9076110bb ) has way more details about what kind of idiot this guy was . 
  holy shit , what the hell is going on with the deutsche welle ? 
  so many wrong , sensationalistic , oversimplifying headlines recently . 
   ... a car that the company ** claims ** is the fastest production electric vehicle in the world . 
  as expected , it has 0 points with 48 % upvoted . 
   cannes , france , may have banned the `` burkini , '' a full-body swimsuit designed for muslims , but sandcastle happily rents or sells them . 
  it has staff members who speak asian languages , such as urdu , to attract muslim families . 
  / r/europe heart attack imminent . 
  they have a live ticker for this topic ? 
  that 's completely retarded . 
  oh well , it 's the torygraph ... 
  `` however , little of today 's data cover the period since the result of the eu referendum became known , with only claimant count and vacancies going beyond june - to july for the former and to may-july for the latter , '' he added .

  `` police spokesman hanspeter kruesi told afp news agency the suspected attacker was not of immigrant background . '',

  this is no mass stabbing and not international news worthy . 
  calm your tits .

   the rate of people not getting sex is higher now than ever . 
  do you have some numbers on that ? 
   that they screamed `` daesh ! '', 
  that would be pretty strange , because isis does n't call themselves that and they really do n't like the name . 
  a blog entry by a guy named `` tyler durden '' ? 
  yeah , seems legit . 
  it 's all a load of bollocks . 
  this has nothing to do with brexit and everything with taking risks with credits . 
  if [ these ] ( http://time.com/4383404/brexit-hate-crime-uk-racism/ ) are your fellow supporters , do n't be surprised . 
  if people ask again how it was possible that hitler got so popular and how jews could be publicly shamed , this is how . 
   liberals haha , you should shut up if you do n't know shit about european politics . 
  of course they can . 
  #no bombs were mentioned, 
  completely understandable . 
  well , somebody should feel like an idiot now . 
  nothing was lit up in russia after the berlin attack . 
  the end . 
  there are no `` emergency lanes '' in germany . 
  most autobahns have a lane to stop on if you break down . 
  as these lanes could be blocked by broken down vehicles or other obstacles , it is usually safer to use the space on the normal lanes . 
  every new driver learns how to create this space for emergency vehicles , and if you fuck it up , you can be taken to court . 
   any idea why the thread in dataisbeautiful got locked ? 
  most likely because a bunch of assholes shat out a huge pile of shitposts . 
  the same thing that always happens if idiots are confronted with predictions . 
  yeah , it 's ironic that the regions with the lowest amount of immigrants ( who , as we all know , are 100 % young males ) have the highest male / female difference . 
  even if you look at the last 10 years , germany is n't so bad : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:ratio_of_intra-eu_exports_of_goods_to_intra-eu_imports_of_goods,_2006-2015-t3.png netherlands and ireland are way worse .

  exremism is the main factor in terrorism . 
  it 's like the mayor of brussels said :  according to mayeur , people should fear not only radicalized youth , but extremism in general . 
  `` we live in a world in which radicalism is growing . 
  people such as donald trump , marine le pen and vladimir putin are extremists too , '' he said . 
  it 's really not . 
   but they would n't do it without the club . 
  that 's the only similarity in your analogy . 
  every club condemns violence . 
  isis does the opposite . 
   where do you get that from ? 
  from his ass . 
  his deep , brown asshole . 
  remember that everything is paid . 
  health insurance , education , taxes , etc. 
  additionally if you are under the threshold , you are entitled to receive extra support , for example cheaper housing .

   propaganda you should educate yourself , this is getting embarassing for you . 
   but we know you mean far-right conspiracy nuts with a boner for strong men and who do n't believe anything that has an official source ? 
   muslim immigrant he is a typical eastern european migrant . 
  fucking savages all of them . 
   i 'm assuming from his flair that he 's talking about norway sending a tree to the us . 
  yeah , i deducted that much . 
  it was just a passive-agressive way of saying that the headline is shitty . 
  how is your cute anecdote related to the graph ? 
  who is `` us '' ? 
  what a strange source .

  #don ' t tell me what i did ' t know !, 
   but with all the other things going on interesting what 's `` going on '' ? 
  the battle of stalingrad was one of the most historically significant events in the history of europe . 
  so , quite fitting i think .
