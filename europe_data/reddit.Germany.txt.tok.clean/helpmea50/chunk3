  i believe germany will do a lot to reinforce this or clarify the eu . 
  there are two visions essentially - 1 ) the federated europe , and the 2 ) trading bloc filled with nation states ( the poorer & smaller eu countries do n't like this particular vision as there is no budget reinvesting eu funds into them and less control over our dominant influence in the eu )  and this is a completely valid opinion to have , the vast majority of the country believe this , even a lot of remainers . 
  it 's just common sense . 
  i do n't believe many remainers had that view . 
  a vote to leave the eu has the government particularly going after fom . 
  as i understand it , fom was always understood to be a cost of the benefits of the eu , except amongst younger students who found it a way to explore europe . 
  actually it was very clever . 
  he knew what would be going on people 's minds , he just was n't talking about the boat that sank . 
  lol , i would laugh but i think he knew the reaction to what he was saying , he was n't talking about the titanic ` ship ' btw . 
  because reddit is different from real life . 
  why would someone harm actually themselves in the real world this way . 
  there is obviously some other logic to it , maybe they thought they want less competition in their job from other romanians or something along those lines . 
  i thought it would be shameful for romanians to share that with other romanians . 
  i do n't think i 'm convinced with the reasoning . 
  if romanians voted for it it is probably for other logic . 
  come on , a vote is more or less private . 
  how would this help ? 
  some people wanted that ( no joke ), 
  i did n't know polish were so welcoming to migrants that are n't slavic . 
  the ft is quite good . 
  it is better than der spiegel . 
  what how come ? 
  russian planes ? 
  perhaps they were all like that , just behind closed doors . 
  the vote validated them . 
  i do n't think any country in the world is different , it 's just the unwelcome sentiment is kept behind closed doors . 
  the irish can even vote in the uk lol , considered nearly full citizens even though they hold other citizenship . 
  ive not heard this view before haha, 
  leave was n't just about immigration i believe . 
  i met tonnes of brits who it was not their reason , i met one where they said ` immigrations ok but i dont like we ca n't control it at all ' . 
  1 of maybe 25 ? 
  but these were in germany so not those ukippers . 
  you can just lie with the primary screening ? 
  it 's always possible to catch out using money , little harder with debit cards around . 
  but you ca n't stop everyone that way . 
  even the canadians . 
   `` soorry , is it okay if i take this candle off you . 
  it 's quite dark at my house '', 
  i would say shorter is better . 
  the average citizen knows the basis of their country 's laws which is very good for its social aspects . 
  americans come off very strong in this area , the same ca n't be said of most other countries and their citizens . 
  removing the visa just means you dont go to the embassy and get one before you go to canada , its on arrival as an electric travel receipt . 
  this is the hassle everyone wants to get rid of . 
  there is n't a way anymore for canada to turn romanians down before they arrive or a way to screen them as a result . 
  you still have conditions : you ca n't work , need cash to support yourself and must leave within 1-6 months and you must be visiting family/or touring depending on what the officer grants you when you arrive . 
  these are the terms can be abused because its largely based on trust . 
  they do know however that you 've overstayed when you try to leave . 
  the others like working are a bit harder to check but can still be abused . 
  these are the same terms a frenchman would get if they visited canada for example . 
  a romanian must get permission before they visit at present , while a canadian can just get a ticket and make their way there . 
  i read this : http://europe.newsweek.com/overstaying-visas-united-states-418273?rm=eu and it had different numbers , or it just says ` just ' above 2 % on it referring to romania . 
  how does this work ? 
  is n't the constitution of both countries/and constituents put together shorter ? 
  romania 's overstay rate in the us is just over 2 % . 
  the requirement for the vwp ( visa waiver program ) is a rate under 3 % which romania qualifies for . 
  the thing is this 2 % is after filtering , you do need a visa after all . 
  if the canadians can show that the overstay rate will still be low , without filtering , then there is incentive against the us for them to include romania in the vwp . 
  nothing like that , just overstaying the visa . 
  if this goes well there could be justifications for laxer restrictions with other countries . 
  is this sarcastic ? 
  i assume not all romanians are criminals, 
  just overstaying the visa/terms of the waiver . 
  this was basically the leap of faith the canadians took & the source of their initial reluctance . 
  lets hope the romanians dont abuse it , we could really have an impact at decreasing movement bureaucracy all over if this proves good, 
  1/10th of your upper house are hereditary peers , the rest are nominated and approved by the elected , which is very similar to the eu in the sense it is democratic since the pm needs to be elected to approve them . 
  @debot was saying that it is a tax haven larger than ireland , so just wondering what that meant . 
  it must have just been some bilderberg like stuff . 
  so the city is not a tax haven ? 
  this contradicts what the other people are saying . 
  maybe you could explain the tax benefits a bit better, 
  this is the same as the uk as a whole , there is a deal there that makes it a tax haven . 
  this is what im asking, 
  this logic is n't the best . 
  you 've essentially said its ok because other countries have higher proportion of foreigners and therefor it is n't a magnet for migrants . 
  what you 're not accounting is the diversity of the migrants , which is odd because the attempt it using proportions is to make the data more comparable . 
  what is a good indication is the sudden increase in uk immigration after borders were opened relative to the other countries . 
  what is a good indication is the immigration of eu migrants in all countries relative to each other for all the years before and after open borders . 
  the uk is very evidently on that list . 
  poland has had sudden shock negative net immigration rates . 
  germany is the only country with higher immigration rates ( and most are actually turks ) , the uk following . 
  __ with open borders : __ the largest eu migrant base are romanians in italy ( 1.1 million people ) , followed by the polish in the uk ( 869k people ) . 
  hence the polish xenophobia ? 
  i think ? 
  this is all with the latest 2015 data [ 1 ] http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/0/03/immigration_by_citizenship%2c_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_yb16.png [ 2 ] http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/1c/main_countries_of_citizenship_and_birth_of_the_foreign_foreign-born_population%2c_1_january_2015_%28%c2%b9%29_%28in_absolute_numbers_and_as_a_percentage_of_the_total_foreign_foreign-born_population%29_yb16.png, 
  the swiss and apparently your country too want that too . 
  you ca n't say the whole country wants these things, 
  did they do a survey of this ? 
  i thought ukip were previously labour supporters , i read that somewhere . 
  oh going through again i see you did n't do this . 
  i thought you replied to the guy `` europe must stand up against tax heavens like ireland and luxembourg . '', 
  thinking he is a brexiteer and saying he should show his flair . 
  well yes i do comment a lot there , but i comment alot everywhere . 
  i guess there 's just more people there who stir me up a bit and compel me to reply . 
  like i said i go through lots of subreddits not just that one . 
  i dont get how that makes be a fake german . 
  i want to transfer to the uk some day and i will still be german . 
  why are you then advocating with the typical excuse whenever tax havens are gone against - oh but they do it , we 're against brexiteers and i support the snp so i would not advocate anything they say . 
  then nothing gets done , as usual . 
  the problem of europe . 
  the first comment was for going against tax havens , for some reason you say that opinion is n't valid .
