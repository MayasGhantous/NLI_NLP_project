  more like darkhorses-katyperry channeling her inner lorde with a bit of fergie-facialexpressions going on, 
  so the male contestants are forced to surf on a canal or take part in a mud race and the female ones get to sew dresses and stuff ? 
  sexism much esc ? 
  yes !, 
  just spend a lifetime googling this . 
  it was actually [ eric saade ] ( http://www.google.de/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fi.ytimg.com%2fvi%2finxhnzqmfuy%2fhqdefault.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dinxhnzqmfuy&amp;h=360&amp;w=480&amp;tbnid=kdfgukfwyt9p4m%3a&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=ut9-qowzycfaqm&amp;ei=0-dgvcrml4uqsahdp4cgcq&amp;tbm=isch&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=753&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=0cdgqrqmwca ) i think he was the swedish contestant in the next year ? 
  at first it was like avicii did this as a side project when working on the swedish one , now it 's like somebody is constantly fucking with the turntables . 
  ouch . 
  that hurts :(, 
  we never get any votes from our neighbors . 
  never . 
  basically everybody hates us . 
  it 's actually indonesia upside down . 
  it 's so boring that i ca n't come up with a proper joke to go with it . 
  kind of sad . 
  there was some ripping with serbia . 
  thankfully only the dancers ripped their dresses . 
  * cough *, 
  he 's got some mental problems . 
  basically not able to compete in front of so many people . 
  haha :d, 
  well that 's pretty confusing . 
  but hey , esc never seems to follow any common rules anyway , so ... 
  remember that time we send someone named [ guildo horn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fglrfi9jci ) ? 
  or [ stefan raab ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjgszpnj7dy ) ? 
  pretty sure we get you :d, 
  but hey , that was actually funny . 
  perfect description of our commentator . 
  this is sooo standard esc . 
  but ... who is phone ? 
  not sure , but the german commentator also said something about a ` used song ' . 
  reddit to the help !, 
  to high to notice his piano is on fire . 
  oh those hippies . 
  :d german commentator just said : ' ... though sometimes he looks like a school boy who just got an f ', 
  whoa , that was a creepy serialkiller look he just gave . 
  with that deep breath and half smirk ... 
  why would it be this way ? 
  have n't heard anything about this so far , but sounds a bit unfair , does n't it ? 
  would be hilarious if they would win and we all had to get up in the middle of the night to watch the show next year . 
  kind of bruno mars is n't it ? 
  i really like it , although it is n't something totally remarkable , it 's still decent . 
  not whoa , but whoa . 
  why are the making everyone do stupid things in austria anyway ? 
  he also did n't seem to enjoy trying . 
  soooo ... let 's see if australia can keep up with us crazy euros ... 
  i do n't think they 're actually able to do so . 
  they had this points-presenter guy a few years back who was ridiculously good looking . 
  was watching with a few friends and we kept swooning over him for days . 
  somethings in the water up there . 
  you 're right . 
  did n't realise i knew this tune from somewhere . 
  i actually like sweden . 
  bit melodramatic , but that 's required for eurovision so ... also good looking guy . 
  you 're welcome . 
  whoa . 
  here we go . 
  german commentator just said : `` seems like bbc still does n't understand that this is not a comedy contest '', 
  i ca n't even make out what language the guy is singing because he 's mumbling in such a low volume . 
  i ca n't hear you !, 
  i would like to hear the recorded song with a bit of autotune though . 
  it 's fashun . 
  i basically thought it was the total difference . 
  can someone translate the main message ? 
  sounds very dramatic . 
  not in germany . 
  speaking like some sort of meditation coach . 
  always making sure not to insult anyone . 
  though it does indeed add up to some pretty funny situations but not on purpose . 
  mostly because he does his best to describe even the weirdest shit in some sort of awkwardly calm figure skating competition voice with a lot of metaphors . 
  thankfully the german interpreter is talking all the time , so i do n't have to hear the moderators weird german-accented english . 
  good times !, 
  still love that song !, 
  eurovision has really started to grow on me . 
  i really enjoyed watching it with friends for the past years and commenting on the performances . 
  though we obviously fail to win any points in the end , but it 's still fun . 
  and i always end up discovering at least one song i like . 
  im not talking about finances but about actual housing , caring and stuff . 
  might have used different words . 
  oh yeah , great . 
  let 's just turn them away so somebody else can take care of them . 
  that is essentially all australia is doing . 
  what do you think happens to the people you turn away ? 
  they sail back home and live happily ever after ??? 
  sorry to disappoint you , but that is not what 's happening . 
  they 're turning to other countries who are not fortunate enough to organize their borders in a way that no refugee can come across them . 
  so what if european countries startet to do the same ? 
  first of all , the biggest part of work would be with those countries where the refugees first arrive , second , the refugees would end up in countries who can not `` secure '' themselves and probably not take care of such a large group of people . 
  so australia 's solution is pretty good for everyone who 's just `` as long as they do n't get on my land they 're not my problem and i 'm good '' . 
  that 's probably why all these new-found nationalists here in germany ( aka pegida ) are so fond of australias policy . 
  but in the end every single country should be morally and ethically obliged to help those in need . 
  and it 's not like australia is like `` oh , i do n't want them in my country , but i 'm happy to send help to their county to make it easier for them to stay there . '', 
  nope , they are just like `` yeah , we do n't want to deal with you , go and be somebody else 's problem '', 
  well , how many did you ? 
  your not expected to cater for them yourself , government does , so there really is no point for all this `` if you like refugees so much , you can host them in your own home '' stuff, 
  that 's a very structured overview , thanks for that !, 
  i think it definitely needs to be emphasized , that a lot of the original statements ( not enforcing dublin to relieve the situation and `` we can do this '' ) was `` lost in translation '' . 
  the message that was received in the countries of origin was in some cases way different than the original ones . 
  that 's also what causes a lot of frustration for some of the refugees as they feel betrayed and cheated out of promises they were given . 
  i really do n't understand how every single article i 've seen so far seems to indicate that erdogan himself somehow rescued that poor guy , when he did n't even leave his car to talk this guy out of his suicide plans , and ca n't even be bothered to interrupt his phone call when the guy is right in front of him .
