yes . 
  the turk tribes came from far eastern and conquered the byzantines . 
  maybe the today turks have some byzantine genes . 
  but does that count ? 
  their hole culture , thinking , political system , philosophy etc is different to the rest of europe . 
  just one example : did they had something similar like the erpoch of the [ aufkl\u00e4rung ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/aufkl%c3%a4rung ) ( do n't know the english word for this epoch , maybe epoch of enlightement ? 
  this epoch is what changed thinking in europe , this epoch is the root of makes us similar to each other in thinking and values ( besides our christian root , which also has a high influence on current-day thinking and value , even for non-believers ) . 
  another `` meandering '' article that can not stay at one topic . 
  it meanders from merkel , to putin-kgb , throws in juncker , and with a bit of gauck mixin . 
  it 's really interesting ( or almost horrible ) , how newspapers abroad have a completely different style of writing . 
  maybe their journalist do n't get month salaries , they are payed by lines or words ... 
  and a car with unlimited fuel ... how expensive would that be ? 
  in germany , public transport is so-so . 
  in economy centers , like m\u00fcnchen , frankfurt , hamburg , the public transport is usually outstanding . 
  it 's not just for the poor , and many people decide against using a car . 
  but on the country we have villages that only see a bus 3 times a day . 
  you are right . 
  and while i do n't like erdogan 's politics ( at least those part that get reported in german newspapers ) , it is also democratic to accept the outcome of the vote of the majority , even when you do n't like it . 
  for me , turkey is n't european . 
  only a tiny bit of it is european . 
  and not just geographically , all other things as well . 
  there is no common ancestry of the people , no common history , no common nothing . 
  just some years ago the `` orient '' started there . 
  now people stopped using the terminus `` orient '' mostly , but if you go on the street and ask where turkey is , the answer will be `` naher osten '' or `` asien '' . 
  they did this to germany as well . 
  they did n't found anything , so no court process was opened . 
  they also were about to [ raid ] ( http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/durchsuchung-des-goethe-instituts-in-novosibirsk.954.de.html?dram:article_id=242043 ) the goethe-institut , but stopped shortly before doing it because it had a special , bileratal treaty based status . 
  really the k\u00f6lner dom ? 
  okay , it 's big , even huge . 
  but is it nice ? 
  did you really enjoyed it being there ? 
  i did n't . 
  also , in the inside it 's way too dark . 
  i 'd propose one of our castles , does n't really matter if you select the one from [ heidelberg ] ( http://www.schloss-heidelberg.de/ ) or the one from potsdam , [ sans soussouci ] ( http://www.spsg.de/schloesser-gaerten/objekt/schloss-sanssouci/ ) . 
  or , if you 're more into modern things , then maybe the [ skyline of frankfurt/main ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=skyline+frankfurt&amp;espv=2&amp;es_sm=95&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bxbpu8bfkfdt4qstkihaaq&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cb8qsaq&amp;biw=1102&amp;bih=969 ) . 
  no other european town has something like that . 
  and being in frankfurt , e.g. 
  in the [ fressgass ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=skyline+frankfurt&amp;espv=2&amp;es_sm=95&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bxbpu8bfkfdt4qstkihaaq&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cb8qsaq&amp;biw=1102&amp;bih=969#q=frankfurt+fressgass&amp;tbm=isch ) , and looking in awe at the skyscrapers , is actually enjoyable :-), 
  if you think this , then you do n't know how the eu ( de facto ) works . 
  no country , not even france or germany , can `` do '' the eu alone . 
  you can only do constructive work by finding allies , by getting a majority . 
  how do you find allies if you just say `` no '' ? 
  normally you 'd need to be constructive . 
  there are cases where finding `` nay-sayers '' * is * the act of finding allies , e.g. 
  if the eu commission is coming out with some braindead . 
  but so far it looks like cameron was n't successful in finding allied `` no '' - sayers either . 
   price competitiveness ... with internal devaluation and with many other things . 
  just do an `` gedankenexperiment '' . 
  suppose greece or spain would go out of the eur , and their currency value would be greatly devalued , maybe even just 1/10 of what it 's now . 
  would their export sky-rocket ? 
  according do you , it would . 
  but they still do n't have the sales force out there , they still do n't have the engineers , they still do n't have the quality , they still do n't have the plants . 
  and so on . 
  also , when the currency is devalued , then imports suddenly get very expensive . 
  germany for example has to import almost every raw material ( except food ) , e.g. 
  oil , coal , bauxit/aluminium , ... so de-valueing of a currency would make those imports too expensive . 
  in my book , the currency value is a contributor to the import/export value . 
  maybe even a major contributor , but not more . 
  also you did n't refute my list where germany was export - `` weltmeister '' , even time before the eur and in times when the dm was not that high in value . 
  it is getting a bit of press , because since about one year other countries are raising the issue again and again . 
   allows them to export way more than they would naturally be able to in a normal national economy do you have numbers ? 
  because i do n't think is the case . 
  there have been years , in the old d-mark times ( before the euro ) , where germany was exporting more per year than the us . 
  for example , in the year 1990 we exported for 421.100 million usd , while the us exported for 393.592 million usd . 
  germany was no. 1 export country in 1986-1988 , 1990 , 2003-2008 ( that is , it was before the us and china ) . 
  [ source ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/welthandel/tabellen_und_grafiken#die_drei_f.c3.bchrenden_exportl.c3.a4nder ) export is n't just the value of the currency . 
  it 's product productivty , palette , quality , esteem of a product , marketing , flexibility , service . 
  and even remote things like corruption , efficience of the administration , or how people see live ( e.g. 
  relaxed , or work - and career oriented ) . 
  yes , the currency plays a role , but if the currencies do n't flow too far apart , that role does n't look lile to be the most important role . 
  still i 'd love if the productivity of some southern eu countries would go up . 
  i 'm basically think that if something is better for them , then it 's better for the euro-zone ( or the eu , which is ! = euro-zone ) as a whole . 
  we also have lots of unexploded bombs in german towns . 
  when a contructor wants to build in some areas , he has to wait until the [ kampfmittelr\u00e4umdienst ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kampfmittelr%c3%a4umdienst ) . 
  just in schlewsig-holstein they found 10.000 bombs in a year ( from the wikipedia article ) . 
  the main reason why london and paris are so expensive is the market . 
  both france and also britain do n't have such a federal ( and therefore diverse / spreat out ) structure as germany . 
  just look at a map and see how london is in a cob-web of streets and railroads . 
  now look at germany 's map , you see little cobwebs like frankfurt , ruhrgebiet , berlin , m\u00fcnchen , but moreover or less you see a mesh . 
  you can name the economy centers of the uk with your fingers . 
  in germany , you 'd need need your toes . 
  this non-concentration reduces prices . 
  that nonwithstanding , in some economic centers it 's still expernsive here , e.g. 
  however , frankfurt/main is way cheaper , interestingly . 
  if the brits want to leave the eu , they are fine doing so . 
  what the eu does n't really need is a `` nay-sayer '' . 
  the brits have been doing this more often than not , it started with maggie thatcher , then it was a bit less obvious , but with the pressure that cameron now get 's it is again prevalent . 
  so , let 'em out , let 'em learn how to do it without the eu . 
  maybe it works for them , they still have remnants of the commonwealth . 
  maybe they come back in 5 years and want to re-apply . 
  but , whatever what they want to do : stop the `` eu membership discount '' package . 
  either you have all the gain , and do all the needed pay . 
  or you do n't have it . 
  yep , that 's why i said `` parts '' . 
  an huge organization is very seldom totally evil . 
  but neither is it totally sober , especially not the cia with their huge number of incidents , e.g. 
  where they treated human rights with feets . 
  but on the other side , they did nice things ( probably still unknown ) , e.g. 
  when they catched russian spies and such ... 
  parts of the cia are evil .
