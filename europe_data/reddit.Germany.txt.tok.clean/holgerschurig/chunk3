  and by now they know the the co-pilot was at a medical doctor and got a `` krankschreibung '' ( letter to be ill , so that he does n't need to go to work ) . 
  the reason is unknown , in germany doctors can not tell others about illness without authorization from the person in question . 
  but : the co-polit did tear those documents , and went to work . 
  now extrapolate from that behavior what you want . 
  the key difference is that the plane was found quickly , and that the voice and data recorders were found equally quickly . 
  there is no real swabian , frankonian or bavarian separatist movement in germany . 
  the most likely one would be a bavarian one . 
  in other words : the uk is paying ~ 10x the money to it 's credit givers than they give to the eu * ) . 
  and yet they moan more loudly about the eu and do n't fix their deficit ... * ) also note that money given to the eu is n't completely `` lost '' , because the eu is giving money back into the countries . 
  the same is true for germany , there 's no information on the metropole area rhein/main , with frankfurt/main in it 's center . 
  so , essentially , the middle of germany is always white in those maps . 
   every ship is obliged to respond to an emergency situation of any other vessel in the vicinity . 
  certainly . 
  and no one in it 's right mind want to change this . 
  but then you can sped them to a southwards coast , there 's no need to always send them to a northwards coast . 
  `` not invited '' is n't `` banned '' . 
  the brits should have decided for real . 
  either they 're going out , or thay stay in . 
  if they would have declared the latter , chances are they would have been invited . 
  but currently they 're irrelevant . 
  currently the eu future is happening ( and shaped ) without them . 
  they need to sort themselves out . 
  hey , you spend less than cyprus , have less schooldays and still you 're better !, 
  however , i think that things like olympics or other sport events do n't tell much about your school . 
  with steffie graf and boris becker we had for years top-notch people in this field . 
  or sometimes we won some football soccer things . 
  but does this mean that our school sports is exceptional good ? 
  i do n't think at all . 
  you 're of course correct , it 's nuts . 
  it might just be that ukrainian people see that brexit , terrorists etc drive the media mob away from the crim occupation and the hybrid warfare tactics of russia in east-ukraine . 
  and that as such any major news media is therefore to serve the russians . 
  still it 's a hard language . 
  i however could n't put my hand into a fire what we germans would use as langauge if russia occupied mecklenburg-vorpommen and sachsen ( two of our east-wards federal countries ) with `` irregular '' troops and local weirdheads . 
  maybe . 
  however , some months ago we had reports that russian money backed some of the new-right-wing movements in germany financially . 
  here is some ( german language ) [ report ] ( http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/russlands-neue-freunde-europas-ultra-rechte-im.724.de.html?dram:article_id=316503 ) . 
  and it 's not only in germany , the french `` front national '' got loans from russia . 
  so there are some forces in russia that want to destabilize the west . 
  probably just for the reason that it supposedly brings mother russia back into it 's former might and glory . 
   and received no name-check question : what does this phrase mean ? 
  does it mean that he was n't mentioned by name ? 
  i do n't care for your article . 
  here in the thread epicflyingcat wrote  raise domestic demand by borrowing money . 
  it 's not hard . 
  and `` raise demand '' is often set equal with `` increase social welfare '' . 
  and this in turn would mostly put the pressure on the towns and municipalities . 
  anyway , if a government , big or small , lives over it 's budget for an prolonged time , it will loose it 's freedom to act . 
  just look at greece and see how driven they are , how little freedom they have to sculpture their future out of their own . 
  given that , it really does n't make sense to say to some overdebted country like germany `` make more debts '' . 
  that 's just unwise and boring and the recipes of the last 40 years , which hardly worked out . 
  there must be other screws to turn , so to say . 
  i like that there is now at least some talk ( i do n't yet see the actions ) to tax big international corporations in a fair way . 
  we need more of such thinking . 
  i 'm not an expert here , but my understanding is that the efta has a free trade agreement with the eu ( and others ) . 
  see this [ map ] ( http://www.efta.int/free-trade/fta-map ) and [ this list of agreements ] ( http://www.efta.int/free-trade/free-trade-agreements ) . 
  i heard that switzerland , because of efta agreements , needs to put almost every eu directive into local law ... yet they do n't have any saying . 
  but again , i 'm not an expert here and what i heard might just have been a rumour or outright wrong . 
  nice strategy . 
  at the end of arguments switch to offending . 
  that 's always helping your argument , 100 % guarantee . 
  a municipality * is * a government . 
  it has an executive and a legislative . 
  what lacks is just the legislative . 
  german names would be `` b\u00fcrgermeister '' , `` ordnungsamt '' etc and `` magistrat '' ( in hessen ) or `` stadtrat '' or `` gemeinderat '' . 
  and when you calculate the debt of a country , you also calculate the debt of the `` lower '' structures , especially in non-centralistic countries ( e.g. 
  federal ) ones like germany . 
  otherwise you miss a good part of the picture . 
  in germany , the part of the public sector that you want to dismiss so easily is for example responsible for social aids . 
  sure , they ca n't eat the cake and still have it . 
  the uk could however join the efta , e.g. 
  like switzerland . 
  why should it interest someone if this is a precedent or not . 
  however , there are precedents where a public voting helped putting disputed areas to where they belong ( according to people wishes ) . 
  here 's a [ german wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksabstimmungen_infolge_des_versailler_vertrags ) for that . 
  that does n't mean that nato ships should roam into the seas of a non-nato country . 
  it does n't have to cost more per se . 
  it 's entirely possible that the payers continue to pay as-is , but the receivers receive less . 
  no , the point is invalid . 
  sure , kids sometimes make you see things differently . 
  that 's correct so far . 
  but the conclusion that merkel does n't do this is entirely wrong . 
  as if * only * kids would make seeing things differently . 
  i guess that merkel sees some things differently than us because of talks with other statespeople , or because of the briefing from the bnd or other non-public sources . 
  maybe she sees things different than i because of her gdr roots . 
  the reasons why she might see things differently are basically endless ... 
  on recent ( hypothetical ) news , merkel attacks petry for not being married : `` i was able to keep my husband , petry lost hers '' . 
   this is literally the opposite of what 's happening today . 
  when you do n't know what happens in german communities . 
  some even declared bankruptcy , some are under control from the `` regierungspr\u00e4sidium '' . 
  in some federal countries there are mechanisms called `` schutzschirm '' , e.g. 
  in [ hessen ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kommunaler_schutzschirm ) that deals with overdebted communities . 
  so we have , at a communal level , the same happening that is happening in greece . 
  brasov and vulcan, 
  it is not low-level , not at all . 
  if you 've ever been the victim of this , you 'll probably also think so . 
  but even if not : pick-pocketing is a crime that usually is repeated . 
  after all you need to train it , so this shows some criminal determination in the first place . 
  that 's a rather new definition of terrorism . 
  the ira terrorism was interior ( almost , the ira probably see the brits as external opressors ) . 
  and the german red army terrorism was also internal .
