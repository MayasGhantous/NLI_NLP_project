  so , if the countries are so timid and ca n't send back economic `` refugees '' , how would more money to greeces border service help ? 
  the eu is not made by one single country , and it can not be destroyed by one . 
  actually , even the word `` destroyed '' is wrong , as if that had already happened . 
  it doubt it will happen in the next 10 years . 
  i had it from a non-tabloid german site . 
  but is [ cnn ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/09/08/gary-johnson-what-is-aleppo.cnn ) a tabloid for you ? 
  that will give you a luxory house almost everywhere . 
  in most parts of germany the cost the property plus house building cost ( for 4 people ) is more in the range for 400k . 
  sometimes 350k , e.g. 
  already in the vogelsberg area , 60km northeast of frankfurt . 
  inside frankfurt or in nice areas of the taunus valleys it 's of course more expensive . 
  i often happens that some us people do n't have any idea of what is going on in the world . 
  just yesterday the liberatarian candidate for their presidency did n't had any idea what aleppo is , or what happens there . 
  the thing with `` west or east of the autobahn '' was obviously a joke ... but a joke with some truth . 
  around 25 years ago i was asked this question from an us american when i said that i live in germany . 
  yup , you got your car after 10 years waiting ... 
  but you could use the money still . 
  when i was in east-berlin in those days , a chess computer that costed 149 dm in west germany costed 2000 m there . 
  so you could get some western luxory goods , just ridiculous expensive . 
  other things , like edible stuff ( e.g. 
  `` berliner '' or `` kr\u00e4ppel '' ) and also education books were extremely cheap . 
  i bought some mathematics and physics books over there ... 
  btw , i never went to a bank and asked for a loan . 
  ths is so 1970 ... 
  instead i used an online service and ended up getting a normal amortization loan ( so no weird contruct i couldn 'd understand ) . 
  but not from a bank , but from a life savings insurance . 
  that was way cheaper than from a bank ... and the insurances need ways to invest their accumulated money anyway , so they 're happy to find customers via interhyp and other platforms and often have very competive prices and regulations . 
  also i 'd like you to stop use this bad language towards me ( `` either a dump '' , `` fucking '' , `` idiotic '' ) . 
  we 're not in kindergarten anymore . 
  finally , the post i originally answered had an age in it , he wrote `` about 30 % of my 40 + co-workers experienced social descent . '' . 
  and it was you that estimated me to be in this age area ( i 'm around 50 right now ) . 
  so i do n't get your strong opposition . 
  please calm down . 
  and why did you revert to insulting now ? 
  end of facts perhaps ? 
  the country where 18 year old youngsters can build houses * out of their own monetary power * exists , certainly . 
  but look at those houses . 
  i doubt you 'd like to live in them . 
  and how old have i been 14 years ago , gauss ? 
  http://www.karriere.de/karriere/gehalt/fast-drei-prozent-gehaltsplus-in-deutschland-168019/ even sources that are n't hurray-sayers say that the wages rise : https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/themen/aktuelle-meldungen/2015/juni/die-loehne-in-deutschland-steigen-weiter-aber-auch-die-ungleichheit-waechst/ many of your sources are quite old , two more than 10 years . 
  and 10 years ago the rises where really low , around 0.1 % . 
   train stations are in the city center whereas in france i give you the ice station in kassel , or the ice station at the airport in frankfurt . 
  but yes , generally you 're right . 
  still i consider our system saner than the french or the british one . 
  paris and london have several stations and you have to use different stations depending on where you want to travel . 
  gare d'est for germany , gare d'lyon when you want to go to the french riviera . 
  weird . 
  and it is the ice from fulda to hannover . 
  i call it a benefit of germany that we are n't so centralized . 
  we simply do n't need a high speed train from berlin to paris . 
  to have high speed rails is one point . 
  actually being able to use it another . 
  i 'm using regularly a high speed train ( ice ) from frankfurt/main to m\u00fcnchen . 
  the biggest source of delays : `` versp\u00e4tung durch personenschaden '' . 
  meaning delay because of injured people . 
  and why is what ? 
  because many people try to commit suicide with the help of the deutsche bundesbahn . 
  a train driver that drives a train with 180-280 km/h ca n't brake . 
  some train drivers now had 10 suicides already ... ( we have delays because of other reasons , e.g. 
  building projects , bad planning , whatever . 
  really , germany should learn from japan or switzerland how to operate a train system . 
  but still those delays are usually much shorter in timespan than the suicide induced ones ) . 
  well ? 
  then please dig out * facts * that back your position . 
  so far you did n't . 
  now i 'd like to see the deaths that the us americans do by drones . 
  or the deaths from car accidents , because this is more local . 
  and then i 'd like to see if we get the same hysteric response , e.g. 
  putting hay stacks on each side of the streets ... or forbidding speeds over 70 km/h . 
  sure , even cities have them , e.g. 
  [ frankfurt/main ] ( http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2962&amp;_ffmpar[_id_inhalt]=9697413 ) but compared to normal local libraries are still scarce . 
  i gave more than export numbers in this thread . 
  maybe you 're not discussing with an open mind only only ever accept that fit to your mind-model ? 
  i can give you [ german numbers ] ( http://www.vgrdl.de/vgrdl/tbls/tab.jsp?rev=rv2014&amp;tbl=tab14&amp;lang=de-de ) , they rised mostly . 
   will only become larger in the future . 
  is this a fact ? 
  how do you know ? 
  people often mix facts and their agenda ...  my point is that germany is likely to lose track of other the wealthy nations in europe and the world . 
  well , we just had an export-import surplus from 310 billions dollar , we even exported more than china again ( we last did this some decades ago ) . 
  so rumours of our death look highly exagerated . 
  what we need to fix is however that some of this money comes to the normal people . 
  we used to be relatively good here decades ago , and we lost this ability . 
  look at this : * [ germany vs. netherlands ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/germany/netherlands ) * [ germany vs. switzerland ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/germany/switzerland ) * [ germany vs. uk ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/germany/united-kingdom ) * [ germany vs. france ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/france/germany ) ( tipp : select the `` economy '' in the top left ) so , we 're not paradise , but not hell either . 
  that 's a bad example , because it does n't say much . 
  but i give you that you did n't find a better example . 
  and in some way you 're right : wages did n't increment much in the recent years . 
  fortunately inflation also did n't increase that much . 
  i wish he had better unions , and that more people would join unions , e.g. 
  but look at the spending in the medicine sector . 
  in the us , the cost is about 170 % of the cost in germany . 
  and still is their medicine support lacking , even after `` obama care '' you ca n't compare their level of medical support to john doe to ours . 
  germans have always be worried . 
  so much that [ german angst ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_angst ) now made it to a known term . 
   and are n't able to save enough money to afford property , if they have n't been born into a high-income household . 
  ... and this is utterly wrong . 
  i have n't been born into this . 
  i have n't even inherited anything from my parents . 
  and still i have my own house since 14 years . 
  and here in my village i know more people like me ( 30 km north of frankfurt/main ) , so no , i 'm not the single exception . 
  sure , i could n't have had a house in the munich area .
