that 's why believe i was stupid for germany to totally stop nuclear energy . 
  even if the country is one day 100 % nuclear free , wo n't make us any safer from the plants of our neighbours . 
  radiation does n't care about borders . 
  what ? 
  it 's just the contrary , the afd is a brand new party , them going from 0 to 7 % so quickly is really worrying . 
  honest question , from someone that doesnt have a very deep understanding of ukrainian history , so i hope it does n't offend you : what would speak agaiinst the krim peacefully ( like , put it up for a vote ) seceding from ukraine and joining the russian federation , seeing as the majority of its inhabitains are russian , and historically the region does see itself more as a part of russia . 
  ( at least this is what i heard , if an of that is wrong , please feel free to correct me ), 
  putin prefers a different vesrion of that story : give a man a fire and he 's warm for a day , set him on fire and he is warm for the rest of his life . 
  i dont likeher party , but out of all its politicians she is by far the best possible to haven gotten at the top . 
  thank you . 
  the context was applied , ofc , but i guess your explanations made it much clearer for a non-german . 
  do n't forget our ` mildy offensive ' swearwords , like ** warmduscher ** or ** turnbeutelvergesser ** , which i believe are unique to the german language . 
  warmduscher  warm showerer : someone who only showers with warm water turnbeutelvergesser :  sports-bag forgetter : someone who forgets to bring his sports bag when going to the gym, 
  have you actually looked at the results ? 
  the only mainstream publication on the 1st result page is focus and that one is just a quote amongst many pther politicians . 
  the only other even remotely widely read site on there is golem - and that article is n't pretty beneficial to the pp as well ( grumpy cat , really ) and even states that prism does n't mobilize the mases yet for the pirate party . 
  you 'll only find what you linked to , if you are already interested in the pp to begin with . 
  it 's a shame that the german pirate party totally imploded because of infighting . 
  this could have been the perfect stage for them before the big nationwide election : the whole snowden , nsa , privacy thing , merkel saying that the internet is still ` neuland ' ( new territory ) for everyone , etc. 
  but sadly , they are nowhere to be found . 
  instead they seem to be have been co-opted by people that were n't good enough for the far-left . 
  im not even from berlin , im just here for this training course . 
  my old university doesnt offer doctorate positions and apparently you need at least 2 references from professors nowadays to even be able to apply for a phd position . 
  one , i have , but 2 is kinda ridiculous considering how few contact you have with some profs as a puny student . 
  that may seem like germany is off well . 
  i have a diploma in mathematics . 
  i have n't found a job 1 year after graduading . 
  everyone i talk to is shocked about that . 
  i 'm currently in a traiing course in berlin , full of highly-educated people , with diplomas in biotechnology , chemistry , biology , etc. 
  that are n't able to find jobs , most of them with top grades ( 1,0 1,3 ) this is something totally new to us germans , having young people wih excellent , applicable degrees unable to find a job over such a long time . 
  we get accused regularly of just not trying hard enough to search for a job , because people say that #s the only possible explanation , because the status quo of ` you get a good college degree , you imeddiately get a job ' has excisted here for as long as anyone can remember , at least in the general consciousness . 
  that 's why there is a huge debate about the bannings in the public . 
  i personally hope they do n't ban them , because of the reasons you mentioned . 
  they 'll just start another party under another name within 6 months , but they 'll get much more voters , because they 'll be able to play the martyr card . 
  wait , other countries do n't wear house shoes ? 
  i remember how , as a child , i absolutely loved the theme song , but the show was sometimes too heavy and mature for me ( i was 5 ) and i was particularly scared of / didnt like the character kra ( dolf ) . 
  i only much later in life realized that this was because he was literally hitler . 
  so , if this fails , we 'll then build a big spaceship ? 
  this is a hivemind post if i ever saw one , since i had that exact same thought a few days ago . 
  i 'm currently in a transition period after college , waiting to start with work , and in the last few months , i had so many chores to do , or times where i had to be home to wait for someone ( like when our refridgerator went bust ) , i ca n't phatom how and when i would ever get that done when i begin working . 
  to their credit though , some small buisnesses here have a 3 hour lunch break , so they can be open longer ion the morning and evening, 
  but the article tellx explicitly that google mail is being snooped on by the german gov ` t. 
  well , wich provider are you using then ? 
  google and yahoo are just as bad . 
  yeah , like the whole wikileaks thing . 
  or now with the mohammed video and freedom of speech . 
  their politicians are really dissapointing so far . 
  and , fyi , that report was released months ago . 
  if the pirates havent picked it up till now , they never will . 
  they are much to busy with infighting and electing the most repulsing , embarassing 20-somehting hipsters they can find to elect into representative positions . 
  that has been known in germany for a few months . 
  i found it : http://www.zdf.de/zdfmediathek/beitrag/video/1733944/lauer-wir-koennen-themen-setzen-#/beitrag/video/1733944/lauer-wir-koennen-themen-setzen - @ 5:20 what irks me most is that he says that you should n't use your freedom of speech to ` make fun of other people ' . 
  although it looks like the official stance of the party is now in favor of freedom of speech . 
  also , the interview is n't as bad as i remembered it , he was mostly talking about prevent nazis from publicly showing the movie and just ` looking into ' ways to prevent them from doing so . 
  ive been looking for it since , it was an interview on amorning show on ard or zdf . 
  the key point there is , that the work in question is so vile and insultuing that it endangers public safety . 
  that video in case is n't . 
  it 's just a stupid , badly produced movie . 
  but it does n't incite to any violence against a religion or wthnic group ( what this paragraph is mainly intended for ) . 
  if we ban this movie , we must also ban the life of brain , south park , etc. 
  of course , the issue is debateable , but out of all parties , i would 've at least expected the pirate party to take the site of free speech . 
  if not , what else are they there for ? 
  hell , most pirates of the berlin parliament probably surf and enjoy 4chan or krautchan , wich have content much much worse than the mohammed video . 
  the only headlines they make nowadays is through silly stuff this or pony time . 
  meanwhile they totaly lost sight on even their core issues . 
  just last week the leader of the berlin pirates was on national tv , speaking in favour of banning the mohammed video , saying something like : you only have freedom of speech as long as you do n't insult anyone else . 
  what bullcrap . 
  what i found much worse , was that earlier this week , a pp representative ( leader of the berlin parliament pirates iirc ) said on national television that ` freedom of speech ' is only freedom until i do n't offend others with it and saying he wants to ban the mohammed video . 
  there goes what little hopes i had left for this party . 
  the idea was good , but the people that used it to get themselves at the top of the party and themselves into the spotlight are just disastrous . 
  that is so poorrly written . 
  escpescially ` in east germany , nude bathing became something of a sign of dissidence , contrary to the exhortation of the culture ministry to `` protect the eyes of the nation '' . ', 
  nude bathing is much more popukar in east-germany than west-germany . 
  drug related deaths would be pretty hard to categorize . 
  would you only include od 's ? 
  death through overdose are probably not that high in that age groups , sine young kids are more often in contact with drugs you that are ahard to od on . 
  much more deaths were probably under the influence of druggs , but fell under the violence , suicide or car accident label . 
  usa # 1 !, 
  i hope that the pirate party is smart and uses the current scientific uproar against journal paywalls to its advantage . 
  becoming the party of scientists and freedom of knowledge would benefit them even more than just being perceived as the party of y8un internet nerds . 
  i 'm still surprised that they still have n't many older members in leading roles yet . 
  i expceted many hacktivists from the 80 's ( when the chaos computer club was founded ) or cs and informatics professors to take more prominetn roles in the party , seeing like those people should have lots more expeerience and thought-out world-views than the 20 somethings college nerds that are dominating the party right now . 
  well , in germany they watch an episode of my little pony whenever arguments get too heated and have reached a dead end : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i_u8iv3zii, 
   well i 'm a canadian it does n't matter what part of the usa you 're from , but one should at least know some basic stuff about the earths geography , like the capitals of eu countries . 
  it 's really funny , until 2 weeks ago everyone here in germ , any was whining how there 's be no snow and no winter weather at all this winter . 
  now everyone is complaining that it 's too fuckin ' cold . 
  sadly , genscher was the last truly great politician to come out of the fdp . 
  [ freeedooom !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soyut5p6myq&amp;feature=related ), 
  i 'm sorry , but how does this fit into / r/europe again ? 
  that 's how democracy should work and why the american system is flawed . 
  the pirate party doesnteven need to get elected to parliament , to ` win ' and get their policies enacted . 
  it 's enough if enough big parties change their stances out of fear of losing votes to the pirates . 
  tell that to all the east-european countries . 
  the fall of the berlin wall ultimately marked the end the closed bordres between the communist countries and the west . 
  from this day on it was clear that communism in east-europe was finished . 
  also the killing of 1000 of jews and the start of the holocaust probably was a big event for the whole jewish population of europe . 
  i agree . 
  and that 's why you can feel free to call out anyone in 2 days that says ` the release of skyrim is the most imortant thing to happen on 11/11 , ever ! ', 
  and i will happily support you .
