i used to do it too , but after all these years it 's just not acurate in any regard . 
  if germany still had the deutsche mark , who knows how high would its value be now . 
  did n't even see that ... 
  i 'm pretty sure , that on the right is [ thomas helmer ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_helmer ) an ex soccerplayer . 
  edit : was right . 
  on the left is brian roy , also an ex-soccerplayer . 
  here is the news in [ german ] ( http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/lokales/nordkreis/deutschland-gegen-holland-in-der-neustrasse-1.455795 ), 
  show them the s-class coupe ... [ rrrrhhhh . . ] ( http://www.mercedes-benz.de/content/germany/mpc/mpc_germany_website/de/home_mpc/passengercars/home/new_cars/models/s-class/c217.flash.html#_int_passengercars:home:model-navi:c217 ), 
  well , the thing is : you have to replace it . 
  in germany you wouldn \u00b4 t drive too long with only 1 plate ( because the police will stop you ) . 
  no , not exactly . 
  without 2 plates ( 1 in the front , 1 in the back ) you aren \u00b4 t even allowed to drive ( you lose the insurance ) . 
  well , even in the ruhrarea you have a lot of nature and old industry turning to greener funsites e.g. 
  landschaftspark nord - duisburg and the nordsternpark - gelsenkirchen to name just two of them . 
  older sites for digging up gravel are turned it lakes e.g. 
  ph\u00f6nixsee - dortmund or all the smaller ones in haltern , herne , bottrop and so on . 
  also , in the northern part of the ruhrarea there is the greenest city ( gro\u00dfstadt ) on the whole of nrw - bottrop . 
  funfact : once an elephant jumped out of the [ schwebebahn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuffi ), 
  ** unborn babies are protected . 
  ** you do n't abort a baby , you abort a fetus . 
  a fetus is n't viable - a baby is . 
  you ca n't abort a baby anywhere in europe ( legally ) and so unborn babies are protected . 
  please tell me more of your `` wisdom '' . 
  except he was . 
  why exactly this is , i do n't really know , but in german you can have a word as a verb or as a noun . 
  `` der weg '' means the the path . 
  `` weg '' means gone . 
  `` der weg ist weg '' would mean the path is gone . 
  additionally pronunciation also changes . 
  `` der weg '' has a long `` e '' in it , while `` weg '' has a short `` e '' . 
  without the capitilazion you could n't read the sentence very fast . 
  nouns are always capitalized in german . 
  it could both mean something like this , but a pr\u00fcgelei is more one sided . 
  ( beating the shit out of you ) would be a one sided action , where the other side is overwhelming . 
  there is also `` pr\u00fcgel beziehen '' or `` pr\u00fcgelstrafe '' , which was an `` educational '' measure . 
  a `` schl\u00e4gerei '' is both side beating the shit out of them . 
   for the 2 $ coin : zwickel ( from two = zwei ) where in germany ? 
  never heard that in nrw . 
  well , my family history was researched by one of my relatives . 
  he actually got back to 15xx ( took him 30 years though ) . 
  the family crest was fused by using two crest , when two families fused ( was more than just marrying off a daughter ) . 
  the german one was the sword with over a tree branch , and the transsilvanian one was the axe with an cross . 
  since they both wanted to keep the weapons the axe and the sword were kept , and the wolve angles were added because of the hunts the family did . 
  the relative who researched all of that ( was an asshole really ) , was so obsessed with that , that we got rings , papers , fountain pens and even a freaking handstitched banner for everyone ... 
  this stuff i just keep in the bank . 
  yes , although we do n't really care about it . 
  we also have rings engraved with them . 
  the emblem are four wolve angles and a sword crossed with an axe . 
  the 6x6 was inventend for the australian military by mercedes . 
  was in the passengers seat for a ride in the brabus version of that car , and it was ridiculous . 
  m6 at an traffic light ? 
  not a problem . 
  porsche on the autobahn ? 
  also not a problem . 
  i believe we pulled through 160 liters of gas in an hour and a half or something like that . 
  well , that might be only due to my definition : a sports car for me is something like a audi r8 , amg gts , porsche 911 , aston martin db9 , some jaguars , etc. 
  something fast , good looking , but unpractical . 
  something not for everyday use ( you ca n't even transport groceries in most of these cars ) . 
  the new [ golf gti ] ( http://blog.caranddriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/vwgticlubsports.jpg ) is also a good looking , fast car ( 0-100 km/h in 6,4 s , 350 nm , 230 hp ) but it also a practical car . 
  cars like these are n't that rare - only real sports cars are . 
  hmm , i need to research what building year these cars were i drove . 
  the ones i drove were n't certainly as well and nice built as a 5-series , e.g. . 
  i believe jeremy clarkson once drove a shelby gt from england to italy , and he said , that he felt like an 80 year old man , after getting out of the car . 
  that being said : i think there are very few people who have the chance to get a car like the zl1 or a porsche 911 to bring it to its limits . 
  in germany its really like the eco argument : have horsepower , but save taxes and fuel . 
  due to the low gas prices in the usa the car builders do n't have to adapt that much like in europe . 
  and this is even true for a porsche . 
  edit : sport cars like a mustang , or amg , m-series , or audi s-series or just cars with much horsepower are more common in the usa than in germany . 
  there are of course cars like a vw golf gti or a scirocco ( i drive the 180 hp version ) , but they are fuel efficent . 
  porsche is much rarer to see here . 
  so to answer you question : very few people drive sport cars , and very few of them american ones . 
   camaro ss outperforming the bmw m4 , a car twice its price and similar in interior quality . 
  i 've driven all of these cars , but the quality of the cars was never equal to the german premium cars . 
  need to check it out , the next time i 'm in the usa . 
  you can buy the mustang in germany , but it is different compared to the american version . 
  nicer interior , better built ( nothing rattles ) , etc. 
  ( this is for all the ford 's i 've driven until now ) . 
  one huge problem the american sport cars have , is : they are n't really called sport cars over the pond , but rather muscle cars . 
  meaning they just drop a v8 with tremendous horsepower for the muscle but the handling of the car in most times was like a sponge . 
  which i totally understand : if you just want to drive fast on a relative straight road this is enough and you can keep the price down . 
  this concept does n't really work in europe . 
  cars have to be fuel efficent due to gas prices , and a larger engine cost more taxes per year ( at least in germany ) . 
  so even sporty cars like a audi s4 are turbocharged . 
  if you go there to personally choose and taste , you should take a look at the mosel ( river ) in germany . 
  all around are vineyards , castles , etc. 
  very nice area to make a little holiday , taste wine and relax . 
  when they do n't have piglets , they will avoid confrontation . 
  when they have piglets they can get quite ferocious . 
  wolves are very uncommon in nrw ( if there are any ) . 
  you 'll find some in saxony and they will wander to the west , but it will take a long time to actually establish a stabilized eco-system , with wolves . 
  also there are no bears in germany anymore . 
  ruhrpott : we have almost everything here . 
  lynx ( maybe one or two , well now one more because it escaped from the zoo in the neighbour-town ) , deer , wild boars , foxes , badgers , etc. 
  despite being still called an industrial area we have quite a bit of woods and parks here . 
  i often see wild animals if i 'm out cycling . 
  best chances are in the morning or evening though . 
  the only thing that wanted to attack me was a badger . 
  most impressive : cycling on a trail at roughly half past six in the morning , i met a stag , right after a corner . 
  standing 10 meters before me it belled/roared ( do n't know which one is correct ) . 
  and damn it was really loud .
