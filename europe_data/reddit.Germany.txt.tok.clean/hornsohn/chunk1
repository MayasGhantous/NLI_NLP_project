whats inbetween though ? 
  its either assad , is , other `` rebels '' or occupation by another country/coalition . 
   `` a culture where honor killings are widespread is not peaceful ''  factually incorrect ? 
  you dont have any idea how `` leadership in the eu '' works do you ? 
  they immigrated long time ago , lots of those people are probably born here . 
  no its the fault of the people who refuse to fucking integrate . 
  why the fuck do you address germany ? 
  what makes you believe its not the us , uk , france but germany who is trying to remove assad the most ? 
  just because steinmeier said something that has been already mentioned by nato and the us ? 
  http://deutsche-wirtschafts-nachrichten.de/2015/09/12/syrien-deutschland-bricht-aus-us-allianz-gegen-russland-aus/ http://news.yahoo.com/germanys-merkel-sees-cooperate-russia-syria-170539704.html germany is actually encouraging russia to fight is ... also , nato and us already mentioned worries about russias intervention in syria , but somehow it is just germanys fault ? 
   being in school = integrating well yeah sure . 
  do you still not get the main point : the building is not bad !, 
  there were normal people living in it , but not to full capacity because there wasnt that much demand for the price . 
  so they put some people on welfare there . 
  that made the richer people move out , not the condition of the building . 
  so the rent went down even more , and immigrants ( some working illegaly on fields ) were able to live there . 
  nowadays its a center of crime , violence and illegal prostitution . 
  it doesnt matter where you put those people , if they drove the civilized people out of this building with their behaviour , they will do it again if you relocate them . 
  okay . 
  im not sure how i can make you understand that the ghettos are not filled with refugees , but  the majority of foreigners that build the ghettos are turks , people from the balkans , romanians , morrocans etc. 
  you cant build new housing before hand , those people are already here , lots of them even born here . 
  really weird how you think the government can/should just tear down private owned buildings . 
  even weirder that you think `` trying again '' will somehow end up differently . 
  the building isnt the problem , its the people living there . 
  do you not understand that refugees just became a problem very recently ? 
  the majority of foreigners that build the ghettos are turks , people from the balkans , romanians , morrocans etc. 
  most of the social housing isnt planned from the beginning either , such as this thing https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/auf_dem_k%c3%b6lnberg . 
  it was supposed to be pretty high class , but didnt get accepted that well by the richer target audience . 
  so they offered some of the flats to poorer people and people that get subsided by the state . 
  that actually made the richer ( or just pretty normal ) people that lived there move out , because the new people ( migrants ) werent the most pleasant neighbours . 
  now it is a shithole with the highest ratio of foreigners in the region ( 61 % ) . 
  thats how those ghettos develop . 
  the refugees are an incredibly tiny part of the people with foreign background in germany . 
  especially until the recent flood of refugees most of the `` immigrants '' in germany are second or third generation turks . 
  i dont really see a solution to the social housing being concentrated in certain buildings . 
  what do you suggest ? 
  instead of one building with flats , build 100 single houses each in a small rural village ? 
  incredibly expensive , and especially immigrants want to live in big cities . 
  where the fuck do you get the idea that germany forces immigrants to live in ghettos ? 
  if they are refugees they live in camps temporarely until they can return , or they find their own appartment to rent ( paid by the government ) . 
  if they are normal immigrants they can live wherever the fuck they want . 
  put them in the same place ? 
  what are you talking about , immigrants chose and rent their own places . 
  if you are talking about refugees , do you realize there arent even enough places in camps for them , how the fuck do you think should the government distribute them even more ? 
  build a new house for everyone ? 
  how is it europes fault if immigrants live near each other and commit crimes ? 
  should the government forcefully distribute immigrants ? 
  kick half of them out of their appartments and force some natives to live there for balance ? 
  our police doesnt want to use force and is too afraid to oppose refugees . 
  they just let them do whatever they want because everything else would be racist ( and cause too much trouble i guess ) . 
  pretty hilarious how other eu countries are having none of it though , i hope germany and sweden remain alone with their ridiculous ideas of empathy without thinking . 
  what a profound and reasonable argument , definitely convinced me . 
  you are still defending behaviour like that ? 
  are you actually serious or just baiting ? 
  nah , the sooner they show ungrateful behaviour like that the better , maybe the public opinion will change before its too late . 
  sounds better than status quo for both europeans and people from the middle east , but probably impossible to realize . 
  refugees have been a topic for a really long time , it wasnt as extreme as today but still covered and discussed in the media a lot . 
  how do you manage to ignore the constantly increasing numbers that get reported everywhere ? 
  do you really not understand that there are coming more every month with no end in sight ? 
  pretty sure the greeks would send the boats back if they were allowed to , but my glorious country knows better what europe deserves so they try to enforce their views on everyone . 
  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=a65_1441034785 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlinge-bundesregierung-rechnet-mit-bis-zu-800-000-in-2015-a-1048910.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l3esbpetf8&amp;feature=youtu.be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dv6qe6dagw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g42ohkechhw http://www.mdr.de/thueringen/sued-thueringen/suhl_fluechtlinge_schlaegerei100.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudmesunai8 of course its cherry-picked , to counteract the leftist cherry-picking of the mainstream media . 
  you cant deny that stuff like this is happening though , and who knows how it will develop in the future . 
  thats more than 4 months old and only 1000 people took part , not sure if thats represents the whole population well enough . 
  lots of things have changed , too : throwing poor , former homeless germans out of their houses in favor of refugees , constantly upping the number predictions , videos of riots and chaos in refugee camps , insane demands and lack of gratefulness , etc. 
  might have woken up some germans and changed their opinion . 
  you think she listens to or cares about the german people ? 
  not for the sane people , but it appears that the majority ( or atleast lots of people ) see absolutely no problem with stuff like that happening . 
  as a german there is nothing you can do , just sit back and watch the chaos ensue . 
  exactly . 
  just send them through , its not your fault that germans actively advertise for more immigration/refugees . 
  and maybe this might lead to a change in policies , if situations like this keep on happening and get worse . 
  but i dont have much hope , people who are against this madness just get silenced and knocked out with the `` nazi-keule '' ( people dont want to bother discussing this issue , they just call others racists and nazis when they run out of arguments ), 
  there are enough germans left who will ignore everything negative and do everything for them . 
  they will find ways to make this behaviour look reasonable and okay . 
  are hungarians stopping the flood to germany on purpose or are there technical problems with the trains or something ? 
  seems logical to just let them through , let the germans that actively try to attract those people deal with them . 
  i hope the rest of europe atleast manages to stay true to themselves and oppose germanys immigration policy and attitude . 
  it seems like enough germans ( hard to evaluate the actual public opinion through propaganda and the fear of saying something wrong ) want to watch the country burn , hopefully they wont manage to drag everyone else down with them . 
  you guys are out of the radar now , we are the new meme ( kill me pls )  800.000, 
  estl\u00e4nder is autocorrected to ausl\u00e4nder, 
  danzig is : 1 . german 2 . german poststamp 3 . german poststamp value [ pic ] ( https://briefmarken-karten-philatelie.de/philatelie_gallery/philafriend_bild_counter.php?bild=gg3627.jpg&amp;uid=25921 ) related i guess, 
  the swiss are : 1 . 
  germans 2 . slow 3 . idiots 4 . dumb 5 . unfriendly im sorry :(, 
  well the next 3 are : greeks are turks who think they are italians . 
  greeks are albanians . 
  greeks are lazy . 
  he is talking about the military [ marches ] ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-325854-galleryv9-pdvj-325854.jpg ) through inner cities . 
  most ethnic germans attend every week to celebrate our national heroes and remind us of our superiority . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-03/strafrecht-heiko-maas-mord ) for example is hilarious , lowering the punishment for murder to as low as 5 years prison if the offender was `` desperate '' , `` trying to save a family member from a seemingly hopeless situation '' or `` enraged by a heavy insult '' . 
  doesnt seem like a very smart proposal to me , sounds a bit too much like honor killings in my ears, 
  they are critisizing an ** ideology ** because they think it contradicts our rule of law and culture . 
  just because you call something a religion doesnt make it immune to criticism . 
  also , they dont want to deport all muslims or completely ban islam , just the parts they see as problematic . 
  thats missing the point though , people are claiming that immigration has no negative impact on the natives . 
  competition that is willing to accept chinese working conditions and quality of life fucks over italian workers . 
  `` italian '' companies owned by ching ping employing huan cheng working 12 hours a day for food and accomodation . 
  yeah im sure thats great for luigi employing mario who wants to keep a european standard of living , salary and workload . 
  yeah , how could be more competition driving the wages/living standard down and property prices up be bad for the italians ? 
  but hurr durr bootstraps amiright ? 
  fucking lazy italians prefering european conditions instead of chinese,
