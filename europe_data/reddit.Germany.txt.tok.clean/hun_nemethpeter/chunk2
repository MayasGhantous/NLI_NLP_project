  we ca n't solve it here . 
  this is a german problem as merkel just lost her mind . 
  without fence we have to mass transport them to the next border . 
  with fences the neighbor country have to deal with the flow . 
  so the previous state was mass transport ( trains , buses , ... ) refugees from macedonia -  serbia -  hungary -  austria -  germany the new route is now mass transport refugees from macedonia -  serbia -  croatia -  hungary and slovenia -  austria -  germany with the new planned fences on the hungary-croatia border hungary will unlink itself from the chain so the mass transportation cost is saved . 
  you can calculate 10k migrant/day which cost 500k euro for mass transportation . 
  without state financed mass transportation the refugees start walking on highways , rioting , etc. . . 
  so fence is cheaper now as we do n't know when flow will stop as merkel act starngely . 
  i think the problem is the opposite . 
  every euro spent on migrants make two more migrants . 
  the only solution is the controlled fence across europe . 
  merkel was an idiot when call them in . 
  now she wants to push the problem to other countries to with that idiot quota system . 
  i am thinking on a gps and gsm jammer it ... 
  well , austrian border is 60km , slovakian is 2km from there . 
  there is a big confusion in the mainstream politics, 
  the break down : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrpwaeme0c, 
  live : http://www.rt.com/on-air/hungarian-border-police-refugees/, 
  i think yes , but the greeks act as the debt will disappear with this vote and they can use the new drachma without any problem . 
  but i think they have to introduce the new drachma and they have to pay back the debt in euro . 
  i think the question is what will happen with the big debt when they introduce the new drachma ? 
  good find !, 
  which version is the original one ? 
  [ the top google searches in syria ( `` immigration to germany '' and `` asylum in germany '' ) ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/top-google-searches-syria-150929151549994.html ), 
  no , northern border between greece vs. bulgaria , macedonia and albania . 
  so refugees ca n't go through the balkan . 
  he want to close the balkan route . 
  if refugees ca n't use the balkan route they wo n't go to greece . 
  this topic already removed by moderators ... on the other hand we should discuss it somehow now ... 
  please give us a non paywall link or copy the article here if it is allowed, 
  something will happen as merkel will be weaker and weaker as refugees coming and coming ... 
  how up to date this ? 
  please put it back this is not a duplicate, 
  where was it posted ? 
  i think we should change this daylight system somehow or at least we should study it carefully . 
  personally i hate it . 
  this graph does n't include a source but it is in the first comment . 
  http://www.parlament.hu/irom40/06505/06505-0001.pdf but moderators sometimes do strange things here . 
  i 'm happy as they did n't removed this topic with `` not relevant '' or `` we do n't believe in hungarian sources '' or low quality . . 
  i think the moderators do everything against hungarian sources and news . 
  looks like moderators are pro migrants here . 
  one of them just removed a subreddit with `` this is just a randomly picked up data '' when the first numbers came out about the newly installed fence . 
  removed with '' i understand you want to talk about this specific article , but if we allowed every `` x migrants arrived in y today '' piece , we 'd have to deal with an infinite amount of those .

  hungary closed its border with croatia as of midnight saturday morning in an effort to prevent refugees from passing through the country . 
  only last week , thousands of refugees were said to be coming into hungary from croatia , but the new fencing and border patrols appear to have effectively stopped them from going through this country on their way west . 
  currently , as both the serbian and croatian borders are fenced off , the majority of refugees apparently have been bypassing hungary on their way towards austria , and go through slovenia instead .

  ... and only 6 migrant arrived to hungary that day ( this number announced at 22:00 so it can be higher later ) . 
  this is a significant drop from the previous day .

  they were transported by the croatian government and that was the shortest path . 
  the whole balkan route is based on mass transportation by governments . 
  before the serbian-hungarian fence the balkan route was : * serbia-hungary-austria-germany after the serbian-hungarian fence the flow was rerouted as : * serbia-croatia-hungary-austria-germany now , with this new croatia-hungary fence i think the expected outcome is * serbia-croatia-slovenia-austria-germany so hungary unlink itself from the migrant flow . 
  croatia may try force migrants through the fence but it is a risk . 
  later croatia can build fence on the croatia-serbia border ... 
  yes , green border will be closed shortly . 
  official border crossing will be allowed . 
  asylium seekers can apply for asylium in two places . 
  and the reality is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pbjsravang, 
  the life itself is terrible for at least 4 billion people on the earth . 
  and they all want to live in a better country . 
  there is n't enough resource to help everybody . 
  and we should n't call them in it will just ruin these countries . 
  we can improve the turkish refugee camp conditions with some money transfer but that is all . 
  but what do you expect from the balkan ? 
  on winters so many people dies because they ca n't pay the heating . 
  there are so many homeless people here . 
  you have to work for a tiny flat for 20 years . 
  if you do n't have a good knowledge you ca n't get job or just a terrible one . 
  the life is also hard here . 
  the balkan has its own problem increasing with an other big problem ... 
  they definitely wo n't bring assad but syria itself is a little bit artificial one with complicate relationships . 
  among them there are sunnis , shias and alawites and so on . . and they hate each other . 
  so there is a risk to import this religious war to here . 
  first , they do n't want to stay here . 
  second syria is 1500 + km far from hungary and there are 4-6 countries between and all of them is safe . 
  so what are they doing here ? 
  i think they want to start a new life in a better country and not just being safe in a country . 
  this is acceptable but is not possible sadly . 
  these countries has own economical and other problems . 
  export the middle east problems to the balkan is a nightmare . 
  why do you expect that a far away country should help for an almost unknown country ? 
  what a far away country can offer is some money for the refugee camps near syria or other problematic country . 
  we do n't want to call them in . 
  we do n't want offer help here . 
  we want that they stay near their country or the nearest safe place . 
  exporting problems across the globe is not a solution . 
  they refused to apply for asylum there , they refused to register them , they refused to give fingerprint and they did n't go through the legal border entrance but they crossed the states border illegally which is a crime . 
  they just used the balkan countries as a route to germany . 
  so what do you expect ? 
  this is happening now , this is not a theoretical thing . 
  look at the official stats : http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama migrants deported to austria in the last 30 days date | count ------ | ------ : 2015-09-08 | 2770 2015-09-09 | 3321 2015-09-10 | 3601 2015-09-11 | 3023 2015-09-12 | 4330 2015-09-13 | 5809 2015-09-14 | 9380 2015-09-15 | 366 2015-09-16 | 277 2015-09-17 | 764 2015-09-18 | 7852 2015-09-19 | 4914 2015-09-20 | 6941 2015-09-21 | 5530 2015-09-22 | 5125 2015-09-23 | 10046 2015-09-24 | 8104 2015-09-25 | 8159 2015-09-26 | 9472 2015-09-27 | 6627 2015-09-28 | 5335 2015-09-29 | 6644 2015-09-30 | 4256 2015-10-01 | 3667 2015-10-02 | 4897 2015-10-03 | 6056 2015-10-04 | 5925 2015-10-05 | 5952 2015-10-06 | 6000 2015-10-07 | 6103 - summary of last 30 days is 161.246, 
  time is ticking and germany wo n't be able to handle that huge mass that is increasing 5-10k / day . 
  not exactly if we do the full transport for free the maffia wo n't get money and we can stop this as soon as we get a clear sign that germany does n't welcome refugee any more . 
  so the situation is under control now .
