   legia warszawa said in a statement friday there were `` no grounds to link our club to the incident that took place in sochocin . '' it noted that the town is 70 kilometers ( 45 miles ) away from warsaw and that the team was preparing for a different match at the time of attack . 
  it seems like they only deny their players attacked them ? 
   communism is a jewish creation . 
  marx was a convinced atheist so is communism a jewish creation ? 
   jewish participation in communism was completely out of proportion to their population size discussed by the academia about 20000 years ago . 
  naturally jews were n't welcomed in catholic , protestant and even nationalist parties who used to be antisemitic . 
  so the only parties open jews were either socialist or communist . 
  lol , `` not even close '' arrested foreign criminals working in organised crime : * lithuanians ( 990 ) , * turks ( 841 ) * poles ( 445 ) what kind of values do lithuanians have who come to germany ?

  you know why nobody wants to have lithuanians as neighbours ? 
  because they have different values from common folk , you know why people do n't want muslims as neighbours ? 
  because they too have different values than common folk . 
  if we keep accepting thousands upon thousands lithuanians there will be criminals in those circles and the last thing we want is to endanger our own countrymen .

  great to see she prefers to stay in germany for her holidays !, 
  sadly dresden has become a propaganda tool and the number of people killed was inflated ( ironically by a british holocaust denier ) . 
  so it 's hard to have a discussion . 
  freeman dyson who participated in the campaign described it pretty striking :  bomber command was an early example of the new evil that science and technology has added to the old evils of soldiering . 
  technology has made evil anonymous . 
  through science and technology , evil is organized bureaucratically so that no individual is responsible for what happens . 
  neither the boy in the lancaster aiming his bombs at an ill-defined splodge on his radar screen , nor the operations officer shuffling papers at squadron headquarters , not i sitting in my little office in the operational research section and calculating probabilities , had any feeling of personal responsibility . 
  none of us ever saw the people we killed . 
  none of us particularly cared . 
   i began to look backward and to ask myself how it happened that i let myself become involved in this crazy game of murder . 
  since the beginning [ p. 31 ] of the war i had been retreating step by step from one moral position to another , until at the end i had no moral position at all . 
  at the beginning of the war i believed fiercely in the brotherhood of man , called myself a follower of gandhi , and was morally opposed to all violence . 
  after a year of war i retreated and said , unfortunately non-violent resistance against hitler is impracticable , but i am still morally opposed to bombing . 
  a few years later i said , unfortunately it seems that bombing is neccessary in order to win the war , and so i am willing to go to work for bomber command , but i am still morally opposed to bombing cities indiscriminately . 
  after i arrived at bomber command i said , unfortunately it turns out that we are after all bombing cities indiscriminately , but this is morally justified as it is helping to win the war . 
  a year later i said , unfortunately it seems that our bombing is not really helping to win the ar , but at least i am morally justified in working to save the lives of the bomber crews . 
  in the last spring of the war i could no longer find any excuses . 
  mike had fought single-handed the battle of the escape hatches and had indeed saved many lives . 
  i had saved none . 
  i had surrendered one moral principle after another , and in the end it was all for nothing . 
  ...  i continued , during the final months of the war in europe , to do what i could as a technician to bring the bombers safely home from their missions . 
  but it became clearer and clearer as the weeks went by that our bombing of cities was a pointless waste of lives . 
  four weeks after dresden we attacked the ancient cathedral city of w\u00fcrzburg and shattered one of the finest tiepolo ceilings of europe in the bishop 's palace . 
  the bomber crews were particularly happy to obliterate w\u00fcrzburg because they knew that the deadly german tracking and fire-control radars were called w\u00fcrzburg radars . 
  nobody told the crews that the city of w\u00fcrzburg had as much to do with the radars as our own cathedral city of winchester had to do with winchester rifles . 
  i began more and more to envy the technicians on the other side who were helping the german night fighter crews to defend their homes and families . 
  the night fighters and their supporting organization put up an astonishing performance , continuing to fight and to cause us serious losses until their last airfields were overrun and hitler 's germany ceased to exist . 
  they ended the war morally undefeated . 
  ... [ source ] ( http://www.bible-researcher.com/dresden/dyson.html ), 
  there are so many great places in berlin but museumsinsel is still my favourite . 
  oh , well than it 's absolutely okay torture them at the end . 
  no , it did n't unless you use some other definition for sharp increase . 
   `` we do n't know if it 's fake and it feels true , therefore it 's true . 
  yeah , its definitely me that is shilling mr. throwaway . 
  i 'm pointing out that thing is n't logically conclusive . 
  the given primary sources do n't show these numbers . 
  i would like to have an explanation how `` nafri '' ( north african countries ) can be lower than the individual countries plus other things that are n't logically possible . 
  and therefore the mathematics of the `` statistics '' does n't add up ? 
  if it were an actual statistics it would n't be racist . 
  but that one was created on 4chan and does n't add up . 
  how are refugees top3 ( asylbewerber ) when the individual countries making up refugees are way lower than that . 
  because this statistics is pretty dubious and does n't make much sense if you look at it . 
  erika steinbach ( poland is a big fan of her because she wants germany to get back that clay in the east ) got into lot of shit for tweeting it . 
  makes you really wonder were op found it . 
  source please ? 
  you really have to give credit to pis how beautifully they played this one . 
  even the opposition agrees that a reform of the supreme court was needed and the actual reform is n't that bad . 
  however , having the power to elect an entireley new supreme court basically gives them full blown power for at least a decade if they select judges that are more loyal to pis than the constitution and enough time to rebuild the consitution to benefit them . 
  if the government now decides that 1 +1 equals 3 and the new supreme court agrees it 's the truth . 
  you ca n't sue the supreme court . 
  this is pretty much a headshot to the separation of power and in hindsight this is going to be the point were poland slipped into the category of countries like turkey . 
  in my opinion the eu should try to get a deal with orban so he wo n't veto any action against poland . 
  while he 's somewhat a pig farmer he 's also pragmatic and can be bribed . 
  and i thought the idea of a miniature holocaust would be enough to indicate that . 
  i agree they really have an eye for historical details . 
  they even included polish death camps . 
   fast population growth is coming to an end  it 's a largely untold story - gradually , steadily the demographic forces that drove the global population growth in the 20th century have shifted . 
  fifty years ago the world average fertility rate - the number of babies born per woman - was five . 
  ** since then , this most important number in demography has dropped to 2.5 - something unprecedented in human history - and fertility is still trending downwards . 
  ** it 's all thanks to a powerful combination of female education , access to contraceptives and abortion , and increased child survival . 
   the demographic consequences are amazing . 
  ** in the last decade the global total number of children aged 0-14 has levelled off ** at around two billion , and un population experts predict that it is going to stay that way throughout this century . 
  that 's right : the amount of children in the world today is the most there will be !, 
  we have entered into the age of peak child !, 
  the population will continue to grow as the peak child generation grows up and grows old . 
  so most probably three or four billion new adults will be added to the world population - but then in the second half of this century the fast growth of the world population will finally come to an end . 
  same with doing nothing . 
  which eu government purged all its supreme court judges ? 
  philosophy is among the top 10 % regarding earnings though . 
  ( at least in the us )  wall street journal found that the mid-career median salary of philosophy majors is $ 81,200 -- the highest among all humanities and social science majors except economics , and seventh overall among majors offered at iup , behind economics , physics , computer science , mathematics , finance , and mis . 
  as a recent article in forbes magazine points out , `` if you looked at the pay of people 15 years out , philosophy is in the top 10 % . '' http://www.iup.edu/philosophy/undergrad/why-study-philosophy/, 
  more men as teachers in elementary schools would n't be bad imho . 
  ghandi was a weirdo though . 
  his view on the holocaust :  `` hitler killed five million jews .
