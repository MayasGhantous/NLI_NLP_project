  because that makes sense . 
  or wait , nevermind , it was actually a `` confidence vote in tsipras '' . 
  or something . 
  whatever , the people have spoken ! 1 !!!! 1 !, 
  seriously though , that referendum was basically meaningless . 
  the `` voice of the people '' never got to really say anything , because whatever the heck they were actually voting on remains widely open to interpretation . 
  as such nothing is really being disregarded , necessarily , it 's just that noone really talks about that particular waste of time and money anymore . 
  `` we have an agreekment '' . . good to see that they can still make jokes =d, 
  they would not blatantly lie for one day at the stock exchange . 
  though i imagine that things in frankfurt are rather hectic right about now :d, 
  i do n't know , because i do n't know what kind of details that test entails and ca n't really be bothered to look it up . 
  back in october there was no reason to believe that greece would go insolvent this year , for one , which does not change the reality of the current situation . 
  i do n't see whta that has to do with the fact that the ecb can not extend the ela because greece went insolvent though . 
  i most certainly ca n't tell from here . 
  if there is indeed a financial motivation to forego necessary steps then that is something that needs fixing asap . 
  are there any official government statements on this ? 
  they 're left-leaning . 
  their reporting is good , but their editorials allow a large spectrum of voices from the political left , meaning you will come across the occasional nutter . 
  it 's nice if you want to read from different political perspectives , just make sure to always distinguish the reporting and the editorials . 
   if the greeks were able to produce 30 % of gdp with 5-10 % of deficit they were having a return on investment of 200 % , and they 're economic geniuses . 
  cuts have been gone far , far beyond what was necessary to eliminate the deficit and therefore were ideologically motivated . 
  clearly not , given that the deficit still remains . 
  and no , running an unsustainable debt never makes anyone an economic genius . 
  the measures simply were misguided , as the imf has admitted : the social spending that was cut had a multiplier  1 instead of < 1 , specifically . 
  so it was impossible to reduce the deficit by these measures , no matter which government implemented them . 
  when did the imf make that claim ? 
  not that it matters , given that you also have to consider a heavily bloated public sector and faulty tax collection among other things as providing economic stimuli at the price of a rapidly increasing debt . 
   by the way , you implicitly admit that the trojka has usurped the legislative power of greece . 
  if they had , we would not be in this mess . 
  the troika can throw out conditions for loans , the greek government is the only one with the legal power to implement them . 
  that article does n't address anything . 
  all it states is that the ecb declared the greek banks solvent nine months ago , under the conditions that they were under at the time . 
  these conditions also included an already agreed upon bailout extension that would have averted the current insolvency crisis . 
  not that it matters , for all intents and purposes the ecb may very well have been wrong in october of last year . 
  however , greece is still insolvent , and that is a simple fact and as such the ecbs course of action is the only one they could legally take . 
   first of all , the eurogroup can not create or enter into any binding legal contract or decision . 
  it does not have the power . 
   second of all , the eurogroup , like everyone else , is still bound to the body of treaties and their legal interpretations . 
  neither the eurogroup nor anyone else can simply decide on a plan that runs contrary to what is allowable ( or not ) by law . 
  if every single country agrees that the rules should be changed then the rules will be changed . 
  yes , it is that simple . 
   yes , it seems finland ca n't authorise the programme without their own government collapsing . 
  would have been helpful if they 'd said that before any negotiations started though . 
  btw finland + baltics in esm voting rights = 3.74 % . 
  i agree that their timing of releasing this information is unfortunate , though i dont know the inner workings that led to that decision . 
  and the esm is not a viable way of going about this . 
  its point is not to circumvent the democratic processes of the eurozone . 
   this was the point where germany told greece in electing syriza that it chose the wrong party . 
  from there everything became problematic . 
  things become a bit more difficult whenever completely new deals have to be made on a somewhat tight schedule . 
  however , things became really complicated when greece effectively defaulted on their imf debt . 
  i firmly believe that if greece had simply come to the table with the deal they 're offering now about two months ago an agreement would have most likely been found with some slight adjustments . 
   so you can make whatever arguments ye 'd like , whether political or ideological . 
  but the absolute bottom line , and which is the elephant in the room in this whole affair , is that the last programme failed . 
  yes , and we can talk forever about why the program failed so hard and what should have been done differently and who is to blame and blah blah blah . 
  does n't change the current situation . 
  because laws are kind of difficult to apply internationally . 
  in addition , trying to bring american rich people to justice for things they have n't even done to america is nearly impossible because #murica , muh campaign donations and lobbies-that-are - * totally * - not-a-form-of-bribery . 
  the eurogroup are the ones making the rules , as such it would not be illegal if they all agreed to it . 
  the problem is that offering new bailout terms seems rather difficult given how finland will most likely vote no and given how there is a good chance that the baltics will do the same . 
  on the contrary , the necessary rule adjustments for a europe supported grexit would likely be something that could be politically viable . 
   it 's becoming increasingly clear that grexit was the goal from the beginning . 
  honestly , how much more does one need to do than to give everything asked for ? 
  in that case these negotiations would have happened much earlier . 
  iirc a deal was already agreed upon before syriza was elected and tried to get a different one , something that would not have happened had the other countries wanted greece out of the euro . 
  the thing is that the last few months have led to electorates around europe becoming opposed to further bailouts or concessions to greece and led to sufficiently pissed off politicians that will just give the electorate what they want because they do n't want to deal with the situation anymore either . 
  it 's not exactly a question of it becoming unavoidable , at least not in the parts where i live ( bw , i dont know how sh handles things , some aspects of infrastructure related policies are handled by regional governments ) . 
  basically , we can only sustain a low number of infrastructure projects in a region at a time because otherwise traffic completely collapses , the four horsemen arrive and fire starts randomly raining out of the sky . 
  as a result some necessary infrastructure projects end up getting delayed because even more necessary projects are ahead of them . 
  plus because it takes years to decades to get a permit to actually build new infrastructure because holy environmental protection laws and appeal processes batman relieving crucial roads to clear up space to actually fix them is often a huge mess . 
  regardless , if there are cases where necessary infrastructure projects are being delayed only for financial reasons as you are saying then that is something that is rather ridiculous and does urgently need fixing . 
  because greeces economy is in shambles and necessary reforms have still not been implemented . 
  though it is still not essential , it 's just that creditors would have to agree to financially suboptimal terms to make it viable long-term . 
  in pure numbers greece 's current debt is not all that bad , however , in comparison to their economy it 's just hitting insanely hard . 
  cheaply rolling over debt repayments to merely account for inflation rate can make the debt repayable eventually without having to offer any actual cuts or relief to it . 
  and yet , from the ela procedures :  to a ** solvent ** financial institution , or group of ** solvent ** financial institutions , that is facing temporary liquidity problems hence , the author is full of crap , has no idea what they 're talking about and only cherrypicks facts to support his conspiracy narrative . 
  to be fair , i think infrastructure is more of a logistic problem than a financial one . 
  while there is certainly need for improvement in that regard , traffic is very sensitive to infrastructure measures which comes with its own problems . 
  i do agree on an increased educational spending though and hope that this will be improved in the future . 
  i would also add that europe wide stimulus would certainly be a good idea ( since on a european wide scale we are not quite at the point where it is economically sound to create a buffer just yet ) , though i think that further federalization will be necessary to truly create viable plans for that . 
  you can make any debt sustainable rather easily by either adjusting maturity rates or offering super low interest rate bonds to roll over existing debt . 
  the premise that the debt is entirely unsustainable and requires direct debt relief is false . 
  the problem is more that if we find ourselves in , for example , another crisis ( which we do n't have full control over ) which requires significant spending to clear up we are going to get stuck with an even higher debt , that will in turn force us to take stronger measures to reduce it later down the line which would be rather painful . 
  the way i personally see it , according to fundamentally keynesian economics now is the perfect time to create a strong buffer to burn through during crisis or recession , so there is nothing really wrong with doing just that . 
  it may be playing it safer than necessary , i am not really qualified to judge that , but when in doubt i guess it is better to be safe than sorry . 
  in addition , one could argue that a country having a buffer that basically makes it almost entirely crisis immune is in turn great for the economy since it makes the country in question a super safe place to invest in , meaning it may very well also lead to economic growth in itself . 
  ultimately , could we spend a little more money ? 
  probably . 
  is it automatically bad economic policy to not do so ? 
  not necessarily , at least not in my opinion . 
  we also have a debt to gdp ratio of 78,4 percent which is a bit risky should another crisis come around . 
  it is not a bad idea to work on reducing that right now to free up breathing room for significant investments in the future . 
  except there is a difference between `` things are going well , but we need a few adjustments just to account for errors made in the initial proposal '' followed by a swift resolution and the current `` oh my god , everything is on fire '' followed by everything being burned down . 
  and greece had an economy that was literally based on unsustainable deficit spending . 
  of course it 's going to take quite a hit once you are forced to stop said unsustainable spending , does n't mean it does not have to be done . 
  however , implementing these measures in an effective fashion was the greek governments job , and they have failed at that royally , which in turn simply intensifies the damage done . 
  which is complete nonsense , it was mostly french banks when it comes to other eurozone countries iirc . 
  but `` muh germans '' is just a very convenient narrative to run with . 
  since you completely disregarded the last thing i said , i 'm just going to repeat myself :  only if you assume that there are only two states , failure and success , and refuse to look at varying degrees in between . 
  which seems like a foolish way to look at complicated issues .
