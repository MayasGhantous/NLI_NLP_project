  yes there are . 
  there were two emperors , who had seperat territory and two capitals . 
  one empire was in the west and one in the east . 
  its the eastern roman empire , which had recovered some parts of the destroyed western roman empire . 
  the end of the classical era ... renovatio imperii ... 
  though i would argue that the title is wrong . 
  its the greatest extent of the eastern roman empire . 
  even though both are in state-continuity , i would argue that the byzantine empire is a different entity . 
  big transitions were the loss of syria , palestine , egypt and northern africa to the arabs and then the replacement of latin with greek in the 7th century ( as the language used in the state & army ) . 
  should \u00b4 ve used the [ old flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/flag_of_the_republic_of_macedonia_1992-1995.svg/1280px-flag_of_the_republic_of_macedonia_1992-1995.svg.png ) . 
  whats up with austria , it never was part of `` jugo-slavonia '', 
  first poland must into protestantism ... then into atheism after that . 
   germany is suffering from inadequate monetary policy . 
  and we are also greatly profiting from it . 
  the euro brings germany many benefits . 
  germans have to come to the understanding that there have to be compromises sometimes . 
  we can \u00b4 t always get all the advantages and the other countries the disadvantages . 
  the euro won \u00b4 t work otherwise . 
  german `` problems '' are nothing compared to the problems of the other countries . 
   germany already is the largest net contributor , germany is bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis the refugee crisis , we took that on ourselfs voluntarily , because the german government acted without the parters in the eu ( except austria , until they abandoned us ) and of course , both of these points are unrelated with how the eurozone works ... 
  so you are making the allegation again that he is against the agenda 2010 ? 
  as i said before , this is untrue and could be considered a lie . 
  proposing corrections on something does not mean you are against it . 
  he does not advocate for a reversal of the agenda reforms . 
  and he also is right in line with official spd policy on this for years . 
  we could also talk about our flip-flop chancellor merkel , who first prolonged the life of the nuclear power plants and then abandoned them . 
  also , at a very , very opportune time ... or how about the pkw maut , she lied when she said it won \u00b4 t happen if she gets elected ... maybe she just changed her position on it , eh ? 
   well we are running a national and not an eu election . 
  indeed . 
  but when we are discussing the character of a politician , its no matter if he talks about eu matters or national matters . 
  gabriel has proven that he can not be trusted , because of his ever-changing positions on everything . 
  where did i say anything about `` national matters '' ? 
  i said positions ... that means the political position regarding every matter . 
  based on schulz time as an eu politician , its safe to say that he does not flip flop like gabriel . 
  but i of course know that the cdu would like to use the `` inexperience '' of schulz in `` national matters '' against him ... 
  no they are not . 
  at least not anymore . 
  he doesn \u00b4 t flip-flop positions every two weeks . 
  thats a big difference politically . 
  or maybe its just that people judge him on his actions and attitude ? 
  nah , must be the `` fake news '' ... because journalists are all meanies . 
  its good to see that christian kern is reasonably popular . 
  hopefully , he can stop the fp\u00d6 from getting into power , at least its my hope . 
  go back to your cesspool / r/the _ dumbass / , please . 
  thats where you can spout nonsense all day long without anyone rejecting the stupidity . 
  uhm ... maybe because most people in germany don \u00b4 t actually know that much about mao ? 
  gosh , that is just twisted logic . 
  people reject hitler , therefore guilt ? 
  wtf ...  some things can only been seen by outsiders . 
  yes , of course . 
  germans reject nationalism because of the horrible past and all the evil that was done in the name of nationalism . 
  therefore , germans have guilt and are mentally ill . 
  thanks , dr. right-wing-psychologist, 
  stop with that far-right bullcrap about `` german guilt '' . 
  no one who didn \u00b4 t actively take part in these events has `` guilt '' . 
  but we do have responsibility , which is something very different from `` guilt '' . 
  neither you nor trump will undo the last decades of history and cultural development . 
  we don \u00b4 t need your `` help '' , because there is nothing wrong . 
  the rejection of nationalism is one of the best aspects of modern germany . 
  for once , some people have learned a thing from history . 
  most people in germany don \u00b4 t care about the military . 
  and they sure as hell are not going to care more for it because of a moron like trump . 
  did n't say its not , its just that more people go to croatia for vacation . 
  tourism is mainly croatia . 
  who wants to go to serbia , no coast there , 
  and itt : people falling for it ( or just right-wingers who want to spread racism and fear ), 
   well since westminster governs the whole uk , surely the westminster government should do whats best for the whole uk ? 
  of course westminster has the legal power to do so , though we will see if it is the wise course of action ... could help the snp in the end . 
  see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/highland_clearances plus , the highlands are mostly hills , small mountains , swamp and even taiga . 
  and the climate it relatively rough and the region remote . 
  not the place where many people would say `` hey , thats where i want to move and found a city '' . 
  `` mountains '' < - nice hills you have there . 
  the city density in germany is too damn high !, 
  but seriously , growing up in western germany , the first time i went to the eastern part , it was a bit mind-boggling to see such big parts of the country without any villages or small towns . 
  especially in brandenburg . 
  yes , this is true . 
  the only question is , why does this fact upset so many people ? 
  anti-semitism was widespread . 
  no one is saying that polish people did anything like the holocaust ( industrial , planned mass killing ) . 
  nice whataboutism there . 
  but not helping jews = !, 
  killing jews . 
  these were mostly people from / r/the _ donald / who don \u00b4 t even know how the dutch electoral system works . 
  the red of that austrian flag is too dark . 
  looks too much like latvia . 
  happy national day , fellow paprika lovers !, 
  let him talk . 
  he is desperate to win the referendum . 
  its a good sign , maybe . 
  i knew it !, 
  personified evil was always a k\u00e4skopp ... 
  the funny thing is : merkel originally was supposed to talk about the eu summit , but the president of parliament took the session of the bundestag in the direction of discussing the turkish situation . 
  so she had to talk about this as well ... 
  you are getting downvoted but you are sort of correct . 
  this situation is disgraceful and unfortunate . 
  it once again reveals one of merkels biggest weaknesses . 
  the majority of german people is in fact against erdogan and his kind campaigning here, 
  it is definitely undemocratic , no matter how practical it may be for established parties . 
  question is , is it necessary ? 
  maybe it is to guarantee more stability .
