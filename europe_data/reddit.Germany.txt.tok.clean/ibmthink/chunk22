  but it should be as low as possible . 
  5 % is too high . 
  its a shame we are stuck here now , because the eu ( or rather merkel ) allowed erdogan to blackmail it . 
  now he will never stop using this to his advantage ... 
  besties forever ... 
  hey , that almost sounds like the german system ... except we do allow donations , although heavily regulated . 
  who are you ? 
  you are neither german nor polish ... does not compute !, 
  thats a bit high . 
  hopefully , this number will sink in the future . 
  because they have to dance ? 
  even if he is , government ca n't fire him . 
  he was a teacher before he was a politician . 
  he is actually still employed , his work is just suspended as long as he is a politician . 
  problem is , he is a civil servant , so its very difficult to fire him . 
  the situation was stable . 
  hitler could have waited and built up a navy/more planes for the attack on england instead . 
  but he always planned to attack the ussr , right from the start . 
  in fact , he was very angry at the italians that they botched the invasion of greece - the intervention there delayed the attack on russia . 
  hitler could have never accepted a `` winning peace '' . 
  it was all or nothing for him . 
  which was ultimately his demise . 
  you can \u00b4 t reason with a crazy person . 
  i never said he was absolutely evil and i also don \u00b4 t want to demonize him at all . 
  i think he is an utterly incompetent person unfit to lead the us . 
  i am not sure . 
  trump sure is a pathological liar and he seems to have a major problem with narcissism . 
  also sometimes it seems he has the mind of a child . 
  but i think trump doesn \u00b4 t really have a coherent ideology like hitler . 
  he is a very different character from hitler , dangerous in a different way . 
  the ideological background of trump comes from bannon . 
  he is more dangerous than trump , and he has said his goal is to destroy the state . 
  hitler never did anything good , but he was charismatic . 
  he was mentally ill , you ca n't consider him to be a normal person . 
  his ideology was sick , against humanity and objectively evil in nature . 
  nothing good about it . 
  he may have believed himself to be the righteous one , but he was not . 
  you mean after he completely took over all of europe and attacked the soviet union ? 
  i wonder why the allies came to the conclusion at this point that there could be no piece with hitler ... 
  yes , he was . 
  the destruction of the soviet union ( and thus german continental domination ) was his end-goal for the war . 
  but i see you are immune to historical facts , as you are attached to some weird apologetic `` hitler wanted a local war '' theory . 
  hitlers obsession was to eradicate the `` bolsheviks '' ( his ideological enemy ) and gain `` lebensraum '' in the east . 
  you are right he didn \u00b4 t want a two front war , thats why he wanted to finish the war in the west as fast as possible , as the ultimate goal was always to attack the soviet union . 
  if it was hitlers plan to just regain some lost territories , he could have tried stopped the war after conquering poland ( or maybe france ) . 
  but this was never the point . 
  hitler wanted ultimate victory or nothing . 
  and that meant taking on the soviet union . 
  as i said , hitler was a madman . 
  typing mistake , unfortunately you can \u00b4 t edit titles . 
  is it not ? 
  lucke lost the fight with petry and h\u00f6cke , who worked together to dethrone him as the leader . 
  after that he left ( as it was clear there was no future for him in the party ) and many of his supporters with him - mostly liberal and conservative people . 
  the founder of the afd lucke once also tried to kick h\u00f6cke , thats why lucke had to leave and the afd drifted further to the right . 
  it is possible that the same will happen to petry . 
  h\u00f6cke has many supporters in the party . 
  hitler was a madman , its safe to say he had no good intentions at all . 
  the second one is a common nazi excuse for ww2 . 
  hitler always planned a big war against the soviet union ( to attain `` lebensraum '' in the east ) . 
  to say that it started as a `` local conflict '' is revisionist , but typical for someone like h\u00f6cke . 
  ** translation & summary : ** in a recent article with the wall-street-journal titled `` the german right believes it 's time to discard the country 's historical guilt '' , afd leaders petry and h\u00f6cke are quoted to have said numerous shocking things about germanys past . 
  for one , h\u00f6cke said that its a problem that hitler is said to be `` absolute evil '' when there is `` no black and white '' in history according to h\u00f6cke , who originally was a history teacher . 
  also , he said that the second world war started as a local conflict , as according to him , hitler was only trying to regain territory lost after world war 1 . 
  h\u00f6cke is the leader of afd in thuringia and he is in a fight for the power in the party with current afd leader frauke petry , who wants to expel him from the party . 
  petry herself also has said some thing about the german past : apparently petry believes that wars only happen when both parties want it , when being asked about world war 2 . 
  also , she wants schools to not only teach about the holocaust , schools should teach in the same manner about the situation of german war prisoners in american detainment camps in her opinion . 
  yes , i have created a new thread with a different title : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5y99ct/afd_politicians_h\u00f6cke_denies_that_hitler_was/,

  what statement ? 
  https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-german-right-believes-its-time-to-discard-their-countrys-historical-guilt-1488467995 behind a paywall . 
  according to the german article , its a quote . 
  ** translation & summary : ** in a recent article with the wall-street-journal titled * `` the german right believes it 's time to discard the country 's historical guilt '' * , afd leaders petry and h\u00f6cke are quoted to have said numerous shocking things about germanys past .

  so according to her , hitler had no choice but to invade poland . 
  i believe he was referring to the november election of 1932 , in which the nsdap lost 4,2 % and `` only '' had 33,1 % . 
  the july election , yes , they won 19 % in that one . 
  did you say ** anschluss ** ? 
  but at this point the hre wasn \u00b4 t as big of a mess yet . 
  central power was still pretty strong . 
  the mess comes later ... 
  they didn \u00b4 t exist at this point i believe . 
  the letts were formed by the merging of several older baltic tribes in the late middle ages ( latgalians , cours , selolians , semigallians , with the latgalians being the `` ancient '' letts who assimilated the other tribes ) . 
  because something something russian far-right troll, 
  kingdom of germany was part of the hre , just like the kindom of italy . 
  thing is , you never really know . 
  front national was once a parter of the german npd , which definitely is a neo-nazi party . 
  the `` moderation '' can just be a facade to attract moderate voters , which is a common tactic of such parties . 
  the policy ideas of the fn are definitely radical in many aspects . 
  i would also fear for france if they get into power . 
  / u/jobnm / still has a point . 
  hitler may not have become chancellor through elections directly , but he came into power legally , which was always his goal after his failed coup attempt of 1923 . 
  he used the system against the system .
