  and there was an election after he became chancellor . 
  this last election was not completely free ( massive repression of the spd and the communist kpd especially ) , but it was still a somewhat legit election . 
  hitler won this election and he had a majority in parliament ( in a coalition with the national-conservative dnvp ) . 
  last but not least , the erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetzt , which ultimately made him dictator by giving the government the legislative powers was approved by the reichstag . 
  under the pressure , the moderate conservative parties agreed , giving hitler the 2/3 majority he needed . 
  only the spd said no ( kpd delegates were already in prison at that point ) . 
  does that mean leaving nato and declaring neutrality ? 
  sometimes i envy our southern neighbors ... 
  polishness level too high !, 
  spain is way more popular compared with italy these days . 
  also it says in the article :  greece has now replaced turkey as german 's second most popular vacation spot , just after the balearic islands, 
  yes , for once people proved to be not completely stupid and learned something for a change . 
  war = terrible . 
  and that means that lunatics such as your kind should not get anywhere near of power ... 
  i think its obvious that its spain . 
  its not even worth responding to this ... 
  only if fillion drops out . 
   i 'm ... i 'm going to wake up with a severed horse head on my bed tomorrow morning , are n't i ? 
  yes . 
  problem is , there are many regional differences . 
  bavarian food is very different from food in nothern germany in general , for example . 
  there really is no `` german cuisine '' , its multiple regional cuisines . 
  here in hesse vor example , we have rippchen with kraut or frankfurter gr\u00fcne so\u00dfe . 
  in frankonia , sch\u00e4ufele ... etc. 
  german food isn \u00b4 t all pork , potatoes and brown sauce . 
  thats maybe the american stereotype of german food ... 
   netherlands  france  belgium  switzerland  england  germany lol , get out of here . 
  this could probably qualify for / r/shitamericanssay /, 
  not really , because we are talking about the country with the most powerful economy in the world . 
  no matter what you do , the shock waves will be felt . 
  which will be caused by the dumbass that is donald trump . 
  that would be most likely fptp , which creates even more problems . 
  i am still very much in favor of voting for parties . 
  thats the reason why it exists . 
  i think fragmentation is a problem , but a 5 % threshold is just undemocratic . 
  last time here in germany , like 15 % of the votes were wasted because two parties barely missed the 5 % threshold ( fdp and afd ) . 
  something like a 2-3 % threshold would be a better compromise , though no ideal . 
  i wish we could have no threshold like in the netherlands , but thats probably considered to be too dangerous . 
  fillion was considered the favorite by the media . 
  until the scandal he himself caused hit him . 
  before that , macron had an outside chance at best . 
  hope it is a successful experiment . 
  wish we would be this progressive in germany . 
  our system is still based on the presumption that people are just lazy and need to be forced to accept any shit job . 
  when more and more people loose their jobs due to automation , that approach won \u00b4 t be viable any longer . 
  you are really [ sportacus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sportacus ) ? 
  why not invent another word more in line with the weird names you have for januar and februar ? 
  :-p how about `` marsen '' for example , fits better with j\u00e4nner and feber than `` mars '' ... 
  just read an article about this . 
  it is speculated that he is loosing voters because of his closeness with donald trump . 
  well , you will be delighted to know that macron is the definition of a centrist . 
  oh , i forget that you are far right , sorry . 
  in this case , everyone but le pen is of course `` evil leftist '' . 
  i enjoy seeing fillion and the conservatives in this situation . 
  they were so sure they would win this , its great to see them stumble and fall on their face with this candidate . 
  no , its disgusting . 
  he looks like a penguin, 
  this guy gets it !, 
  schnitzel without green sauce , thats just sad . 
  sorry , this one on the right can \u00b4 t pass without !, 
  austrian schnitzel wins hands down . 
  still , i like the frankfurter schnitzel with green sauce ( for the potatoes , of course ) . 
  if i have learned something on reddit , then yes , its that germany is a caliphate now . 
  yay , pakistan - that means we are a power with nuclear weapons !, 
  but , f ** k , it also means we have sharia law ... 
  relevant user name . 
  i would eat both kinds of garlic bread . 
  but its all done to adapt to your taste !, 
  don \u00b4 t you like the food with more chemicals and worse taste ? 
  make sense , yes . 
  fit ? 
  hit and miss . 
  ov is much preferred in such cases . 
  disney movies especially i often can only enjoy in english . 
  he was popular in germany for a fews years because he made the right song at the right point in time . 
  no one loves him today . 
  most young people don \u00b4 t know who he is . 
  `` germany loving ` the hoff ' today '' is a meme . 
  no one loves hasselhoff . 
  stop with the stupid memes . 
  i was living on the countryside too , i guess they just wanted to let us kids sing the popular songs as well , so the classes would be less boring :d i even had the cd of that ketchup song ... 
  i know , i complained about it already : https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/comments/5uett5/could_the_hesse_flair_be_changed/ i might change back to the german flair . 
  too bad , i would like to wear the flair of my local region ( just like you ) , but its just too easy to mix it up . 
  well ... the text may be dumb , but to us it was all gibberish anyway . 
  :d did n't even know it was romanian till now . 
  we also sung this : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8fjywbcv_8e oh , and lets not forget about that other hit summer song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5llcbscguae  e : poland in reverse ? 
  no , hesse/germany, 
  i was 8 and this song was sung in school even . 
  there you can see our secret german master plan in action . 
  we will slowly germanize the eastern part of the netherlands , so the dutch have to gain more and more land from the sea to compensate . 
  eventually , they will reach britain , so then we can finally invade !, 
  [ muhahaha !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/7edeoeuxdmu?t=8s ), 
  still hope hamon can make it . 
  melenchon needs to give up . 
  you can blame germany for some of the problems in the eu right now , but for sure not for the trouble that finland is in . 
  and you are also not following austerity !, 
  i wonder how this is possible ... maybe because austerity is not the answer to the problems after all ? 
  keep up the good work guys !, 
  proud of portugal ...
