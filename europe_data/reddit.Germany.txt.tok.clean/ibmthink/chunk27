  cutting income taxes helps richer people though . 
  what would have an effect and really help low income people : cutting the vat for things like food . 
  but they sure as hell are not planning to do that , nor to raise the taxes for higher incomes back to the old level ( a move that would create some room for tax-cuts for lower incomes ) . 
  sigmar gabriel , vice chancellor of germany and currently minister of foreign affairs . 
  former head of the spd and could-be chancellor candidate ( he gave up on that himself , seeing how unpopular he was/is ), 
  don \u00b4 t even engage him , he wants to `` tame '' free media for his nationalist-fascist course : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5rvkgw/cover_of_this_weeks_der_spiegel/ddbe0mp/, 
  i bet it was the muslims who did this !, 
  sad !, 
  #makeancientgreecegreatagain / s, 
  the campaigning started right after merkel announced her candidacy last year . 
  of course , it was relatively low key , as the spd not yet announced their candidate , so they couldn \u00b4 t really attack the spd yet . 
  you can tell how surprised they were that schulz was chosen , they had big plans in the case gabriel was announced . 
  lowering taxes would have little effect on the economy , but it would impair the ability of the state to invest . 
  the money should be used for investment and to pay long-term debt . 
  of course the cdu has already started campaigning . 
  thats why sch\u00e4uble already said they might want to lower some taxes after the election ( thats basically the definition of campaigning ) . 
  and they are already trying to play the `` red-scare '' card . 
  people just might be sick of merkel ( could happen after 12 years ) , and schulz is someone who isn \u00b4 t burned from federal-level-politics yet . 
  i guess its refreshing to have an honest alternative who isn \u00b4 t gabriel ... 
  i was pretty sure a few days before the election that trump might win . 
  hillary had no momentum , she was very unpopular and if you followed the situation in the swing-states , it was clear trump had a very real chance . 
  only ignorant people said it was `` impossible '' . 
  that trump could win was very obvious for anyone who really payed attention . 
   keep your smug attitude i could say the same about you . 
  don \u00b4 t celebrate victory before the game is over . 
   we promote fredom of speech here right . 
  we promote freedom of speech , which also includes press-freedom . 
  this is why someone who wants to violate that should be called out on his anti-democratic views . 
  we already had two states in german history without press freedom . 
  one was the nazi state , the other the gdr . 
  you should know better . 
  some people never learn ... 
  they never fully go away . 
  thats why it is so important to keep up the fight . 
   complains about `` lies ''  `` an islamic tradition '' < - spreads more lies @ / u/arschhaar / , i would advise you to stop discussing with him . 
  its pointless to argue with someone who wants to end press-freedom to proclaim his `` truth '' . 
  political landslides ? 
  lol , 52 % for brexit and trump got elected without a majority in the popular vote . 
  you are on thin ice . 
  careful , trumps government work may make you fall into the cold water . 
  still salty that / r/altright / was banned and searching for a new home ? 
  well , / r/europe / ain \u00b4 t it , so take your fascist views somewhere else . 
  its so funny to see all these triggered trumpists whining about press-freedom and `` left media '' . 
  go back to your safe-space / r/the _ donald / if you don \u00b4 t want to be faced with opposing opinions and reality . 
  and guess what : spiegel always tries to have a provocative cover . 
  no matter which topic . 
  sure , but its not our doing nor our `` fault '' . 
  the euro wasn \u00b4 t even germany \u00b4 s idea . 
  that argument is just really dumb . 
  but what do you expect from trump and his kind ... 
  how to spot idiot trumpists : they use alternative facts ( lies ) . 
  like `` germany manipulates the euro '', 
  maybe germany should liberate switzerland . 
  heard there is an oppressed german minority there . 
  :-) / s of course we would never do this ( not even hitler dared ) , but man , it would be great , just to spite you ( and by you i mean you particularly , not other swiss people ) . 
  he was , because he knew what he was doing . 
   besides , who needs facts when only feels are real that is the way the trump supporters work . 
  citation on the narcissistic personality ? 
  its pretty obvious if you watch trump . 
  he loves the applause , the compliment , he needs it . 
  after all , he also has the show-biz background . 
  if you criticize him on the other hand , you are instantly an enemy . 
  normally psychologists don \u00b4 t do a diagnosis from afar , but its pretty much agreed that his an extreme narcissist . 
  trump was a schoolyard bully in his younger years , and sometimes it seems he is still stuck in that mindset of a 13 year old bully who can \u00b4 t accept defeat ( or facts that speak against his mindset =  alternative facts ) . 
  this is also what his biographer stated . 
  in his books , he talks about that you have to hit back as hard as you can if someone hits you , basically destroy him . 
  that might be fine as a reckless business-tycoon , but as a president , its not . 
  he is just not fit for this office at all , too unstable . 
  its really interesting to see your weird obsession with germany . 
  you seem to hate the country and the people , yet you post so many topics about the country . 
  is it a love-hate relationship ? 
  or are you just another trump-troll frustrated with germany because we `` reject '' the wisdom ? 
  people don \u00b4 t care about the `` leadership of the free world '' . 
  they do care that germany does not get someone like trump as chancellor though . 
  its pretty obvious . 
  he is not really sane , due to his extreme-narcissistic personality , so he will do more insane things based on his track-record so far . 
  and if he gets his way in the economic area , the us will experience an even bigger crash than 2008 . 
  i think the graphics show a different method called `` cum and ex '' . 
  * cum * comes from latin and means `` with '' / mit in german . 
  stands for '' * with * stocks * with * dividend '' = cum cum, 
  ** summary & tl ; dr : ** german banks and foreign investors avoided certain capital-gain-taxes for years with the `` cum-cum-method '' . 
  finance minister sch\u00e4uble knew of this practice since 2011 , did nothing for 5 years about it . 
  his ministry only moved in 2016 . 
  german state might have lost up to 6 billion euro every year because of this . 
   it owns the ecb . 
  what ? 
  the ecb is heavily criticized here in germany because it is not doing what the german government or the bundesbank wants . 
  sorry , but you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  the social market economy concept was influenced by the ordoliberal school in key areas , but it was not ordoliberal . 
  there are many differences . 
  oh , can you point me to a country where the pure vision of ordoliberalism was realized ? 
  thanks . 
  i can say for sure thats its not ( west - ) germany . 
  i do understand ordoliberalism . 
  but i think it doesn \u00b4 t work in reality . 
  anyway . 
  we will never agree on this . 
  just note that smugness and arrogance don \u00b4 t win elections . 
  really ? 
  why do you think there was a tax cut for the top-earners in 2000 from 53 % to 42 % ?
