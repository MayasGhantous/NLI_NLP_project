  afd ? 
  haha , sure , those clonws will take over with roughly 10-15 %, 
  isn \u00b4 t that mostly vodka ? 
  * manner mag man eben . 
  * the austrians win again . 
  will the hungarian left/liberal parties ever make a comeback ? 
   did you just say hungarian sea ? 
  isn \u00b4 t that the balaton ? 
  right . 
  no one takes her seriously . 
  former family minister turned defense minister . 
  only the important countries are in the list . 
  plus , you are the middle child ( ** be ** ne ** lux ** ), 
  it was a mean and unnecessary slander at willy brandt , who was a far more important chancellor then schmidt . 
  yes , it does . 
  not enough kids . 
  absolutely . 
  i have said it a million times before , i will probably say it a million times again : merkel is no good leader . 
  no decisive action . 
  no real reforms . 
  no vision for this country . 
  only reaction when some crisis happens . 
  also look at the clusterf ** k that our health system is . 
  two class system , doctors leave the rural areas ... one of the latest headlines : our health minister ( mr. piggy ) wants to ban the possibility to buy prescription based medicine via the internet , after the court rules that the german medicine price-fixing is illegal . 
  so instead of fixing the problem ( medicine is too expensive , only pharma-companies and drugstores profit ) , they are making it worse . 
  what else did you expect from the lobby-party though ... 
  yeah , against her fierce resistance . 
  mindestlohn was condemned long by her and her party . 
  not her doing . 
  sure . 
  its `` everyone i don \u00b4 t like is a terrorist . '', 
  like the journalists from cumhuriyet , who are clearly supporting g\u00fclen - after all , they have written so many investigative pieces about his movement . 
  and if you are unaware , that post above yours was sarcastic . 
  maybe we should sanction turkey a little bit . 
  lets see how he likes that . 
  when putin put some sanctions on him , he came back begging for putin to lift them again . 
  because clearly , chp and its leader supports terrorism . 
  this is gold . 
  literally . 
  when i look at trump ... yeah . 
  definitely . 
  bojo also kinda looks like him . 
  sorry , i don \u00b4 t speak this language . 
  a lot of russia between you and them . 
  ambitious too much ? 
  the way i see it , labour has no power to block article 50 anyway , without some votes from the tories . 
  relevant user name . 
  maybe . 
  the tendencies i have been observing are not good . 
  people don \u00b4 t trust the system anymore and they have good reason too . 
  there was an interesting late night documentation on german tv a few days ago about this topic , talking about the various ways rich companies and billionaires are influencing the election through donations , especially after the supreme courts ruling in 2010 . 
  clinton continuing that trend can \u00b4 t be healthy for a nation that is extremely split and polarized into winners and loosers of the system . 
  in the end , this distrust may develop into a disdain of democracy , which could pave the way for a tyrant . 
  unfortunately , i think no nation is immune to this , not even one of the motherlands of democracy . 
  trump is a first sign of something like this . 
  trump on the other hand is a human being without any morality and blatant racist , it seems . 
  impulsive and with bad temper , and also seemingly without a clue regarding many complex topics in politics . 
  his election would be a catastrophe as well . 
  too be honest , our national anthem sucks from a musical standpoint imho . 
  i agree with the russian anthem . 
  its a matter of taste of course , but that anthem just screams `` russia '' . 
  at least we are not front line anymore . 
  by the way , he is much more of a `` friend '' of russia than clinton . 
  i worry more about the usa . 
  though , you really are fucked in both cases i guess . 
  the current system is corrupt and might lead into a civil war in the long run ( all those militias and weapons sure are not a good sign ) , but trump ain \u00b4 t be the right one to change that . 
  he might destroy the usa completely from the inside . 
  see , you are not interested in facts . 
  pointless to discuss with you . 
  victim-complex par excellence . 
  the government made a big mistake to think that those who were invited to work here would go back , i agree there . 
  thus , the integration efforts in the first years were really bad . 
  even though thats a long time ago , it doesn \u00b4 t happen often that low-class families go up into the middle class . 
  thats bad , but its the same for german low-class families , getting a good graduation is more difficult in germany if your family is poor . 
  so most of the lower class families stay in the lower class . 
  you just ignore the background of the immigrants and put all blame on germans . 
  yes , germans carry some blame , but they are not to blame for everything . 
  you can \u00b4 t just drop out of school after elementary school , school is mandatory until the 9th grade . 
  so most turks do not drop out before that . 
  here are some real statistics ( based on 2001 numbers , this might be a little bit different today ) : 70 % of all turks only reach a hauptschul-abschluss . 
  thats the minimum qualification you can reach . 
  thats not good , but also not nearly as bad as dropping out after elementary school . 
  20 % drop out of school after elementary school , not 80-90 % . 
  i see more than enough turks at my university ( frankfurt ) . 
  some of them are friends of mine , smart , nice people . 
   how is this possible in your opinion ? 
  because it seems like it 's not the turks fault , it 's your you would only come to that conclusion if you really are clueless about the turks that came to germany . 
  the turks that immigrated here came mostly in the boom days of the 60s as gastarbeiter , who were supposed to work here and then go back . 
  of course , many stayed , and their families moved over here as well . 
  problem though : they came mostly for low-qualified jobs , and many turks came from the less developed parts of turkey ( east anatolia ) . 
  who also tend to be more conservative than turks in turkey ( and thus vote more for erdogan as well ) . 
  so naturally , this created a new low-class in germany , with all the associated problems . 
  which in turn created lots of prejudices against turks among many germans . 
  nice joke there . 
  but sure , drink the erdogan made cool-aid . 
   pro-human rights , pro-secularism is this sarcasm ? 
  the far right government , which contains jewish-orthodox-parties , pro human rights and secular ? 
  the government that does everything in its power to prevent a two-state solution and helps establish even more settlements on westbank territory ? 
  no he is not . 
  akp is an islamic party , that rejects secularism to a certain degree .
