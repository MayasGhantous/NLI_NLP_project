  there needs to be another haircut , no way around that . 
  greece needs a fresh start with investments and new ideas . 
  most important of all - a new culture with less corruption . 
  not market radical ideas . 
  they don \u00b4 t work . 
  the neo-liberal vision crashed and failed in 2008 . 
  til that the k\u00f6nigsberg area apparently is not part of russia anymore . 
  has poland silently annexed it ? 
   changes of policy are a president 's job . 
  what 's new ? 
  america didn \u00b4 t have such a protectionist , isolationist president for a long time . 
  i think you are not really aware of the importance of this . 
  this could be the beginning of a new era , since ww2 , the usa were the nation that promoted a globalized world . 
  so this goes well beyond the implications for nato . 
   regardless of how you look at this issue , though , none of it really provides a good reason for having this thread . 
  you also haven \u00b4 t given a single good reason why not to discuss this here . 
  people want to discuss . 
  there is no reason to not let them discuss this important event . 
  a pinned thread gives a central place for discussion without having 3-4 split-up threads . 
  he did indirectly . 
  most prominently here : https://youtu.be/srbsjndk1t0?t=8m38s `` we assembled here to today , are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city , in ** every foreign capital ** , in every hall of power : from this day forward , a new vision will govern our land , from this day forward its going to be ** only ** america first !, 
  america first ! '', 
  which translated means `` screw our partners , we don \u00b4 t care for you anymore '' . 
  this whole speech was a veiled threat to anyone who dares to oppose him . 
  as the mods have said here in this thread , they choose to open threads on significant historical events that will be pinned down , i believe they compared it with 9/11 , so an event with historical importance . 
  which trumps inauguration is , because it could bring major changes to the policies of the # 1 world power . 
  even if you don \u00b4 t see them as our ally anymore ( which they still are until they officially end that status , by dissolving nato for example ) , you can \u00b4 t deny that they are still the # 1 power in the world . 
  the mods choose what to pin down and what not to pin down . 
  because europe is part of this world , and the us is the most important ally of western europe historically . 
  so this affects europe and thus is to be discussed . 
  if you don \u00b4 t want to discuss this , feel free to ignore this thread . 
  i can see putin taking his pants off ... 
  oh no , not our precious british hipsters ... 
  yes , as you say , it was done to undercut the appeal of the socialist spd , not because the state was so liberal . 
  on the contrary : this was only possible because the state was not liberal , as the more liberal states were following `` laissez faire '' politics . 
  as the leader of a conservative state , bismark was able to implement the welfare state without much resistance from a liberal parliament . 
  it seems like a contradiction , but if you think about it , it makes sense . 
  so no , it was not more liberal . 
  it was a very conservative state , much more conservative than the us or other european nations , especially uk & france . 
  thank you for your answer !, 
  do you think greece should have left the euro ? 
  i never said that france was born in the french revolution , nor that great britain didn \u00b4 t have a militaristic tradition . 
  the point still stands that both are to be considered more liberal states , while the russian empire , austria-hungary and russia were on the conservative side . 
   i 'd argue this due to the extreme presence of propaganda during the first world war as well as in the post-war years . 
  this is true , especially because of the dolchsto\u00dfl\u00fcge . 
  however , there need to be certain values in the minds of the population for that propganda to work . 
  another big hint is the justice system during the weimar republic : due to the continuity with the empire , many judges from the empire were still in place in the republic . 
  the result was that left criminals were punished hard , while right criminals ( like hitler ) were punished lightly . 
  i am well aware that the treaty of versailles played a big part in the rise of hitler , but it is not the only reason . 
   the vision might have been a moderate one , yet , no one can guarantee the success of that vision and not the success of a more radical right-wing or left-wing parlament . 
  well , this was really what the parliament had decided , so there is nothing to speculate about . 
  it only did not happen because the prussian king did not accept the crown of emperor from the parliament . 
  a more radical vision was rejected . 
  this is what h\u00f6cke wants to do , he wants germans to forget the nazi-period and to glorify the imperial time , to create `` positive nationalism '' . 
  he basically wants to rewrite history completely . 
   such was the norm during these days . 
  drawing a comparison between modern times and the past is faulty at best and naive and stupid at worst . 
  don \u00b4 t try to justify or downplay this . 
  no , france and great-britain ( as two examples ) were not born from these thoughts and values . 
  at this point , both had a long , liberal tradition , something that germany lacked . 
   that is a very dubious statement . 
  the rise of fascism had many facettes and many ways of how it came about , saying there is a single cause for it is ridiculous . 
  i never said it is the single cause , so don \u00b4 t put words in my mouth . 
  i said it laid the foundations , which you can \u00b4 t really deny . 
  there are reasons why the weimar republic failed , and the non-democratic , anti-liberal mindset of many germans was a key reason ( but not the only one ) . 
  this mindset did not come out of nowhere . 
  if you grow up in a society , you get molded by it . 
   extremely questionable . 
  possible , but questionable . 
  germany was not britain , there could have been an alliance of anti-liberal governments ( so , all of them ) against germany and that would 've been the end of that it is speculation . 
  i would say this this wouldn \u00b4 t have happened . 
  the vision for a united germany that the paulskirchenparlament had was a moderate one . 
  they still wanted to keep the monarchy . 
  unless they would have gone all out radical-liberal-socialist , i would not see a coalition against germany . 
  but again , that is speculation . 
  the cause was well known ( the austrian declaration of war on serbia ) . 
  this crisis was already going on for one month , i don \u00b4 t think the public was a uninformed as you say . 
  economic growth ? 
  sure , a large , unified state has more potential than many small , fractured states . 
  also , the industrialization really picked up steam ( ha , nice pun ) during that time in germany . 
  social security , yes . 
  though this was only done to keep the newly founded spd in check and the workers under control . 
  but a development in favor of democracy or parlamentarism , i don \u00b4 t see it in the kaiserreich . 
  prussia still had elections in classes . 
  the parliament was more seen as a necessary evil by the ruling class . 
  not how it happened . 
  austria declared war against serbia , then russia mobilized its troops . 
  germany set an ultimatum for russia to take that mobilization back . 
  this did not happen , so germany declared russia the war , not the other way around . 
  and yes , it was a wave of nationalism . 
  the war-enthusiasm gripped the majority of the population . 
   so when we try to get refugees coming to germany to work and learn our language , we are basically nazis trying to make their `` minority vanish from german territories '' ? 
  come on . 
  thats a stupid comparison if i ever heard one . 
  the prussians occupied the territory of another state and tried to destroy the culture of the people living there . 
  and you compare that to the refugee crisis ? 
  thats more than dumb . 
  i did say `` say what you will about schulz ... '' - there are enough things to criticize about him , but he certainly was not a weak president . 
  i agree that it was an era of discovery and science . 
  but it was also the era of colonialism and imperialism and all the connected atrocities .
