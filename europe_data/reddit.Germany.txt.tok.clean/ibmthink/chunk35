  these are not exclusive `` traits '' . 
  if you believe in the existence of distinct human `` races '' that can go extinct , then you are a racist - at least have the guts to stand up for your own believes !, 
  don \u00b4 t hide behind this `` uh , i am a victim because you called me out as racist '' meme . 
  its becoming easier every day to spot the racists , they are not even trying to hide it anymore . 
  but i love paprika , and i am germa ... damnit , i am 25 % hungarian : - /, 
  latveria , you know , the country ruled by dr. doom . 
  austria-hungary wasn \u00b4 t a german state . 
  austria was . 
  austria-hungary was formed after austria lost the german war against prussia , so really after austria was `` out '' of germany . 
  before it was just austria . 
  one of the key separations was that austria controlled hungary . 
  when the size of germany was discussed in 1848 in the frankfurt paulskirchen-parliament , the gro\u00dfdeutsche l\u00f6sung was proposed , which would have included austria and slovenia and the czech republic . 
  but austria would have had to give up hungary for it to work , so the kleindeutsche l\u00f6sung was preferred in the end . 
  the wall didn \u00b4 t last for 1000 years , so it was a complete disappointment of course / s, 
  i never said that you are an nra propagandist ( like , that you have that position in the nra ) , but what you bring into the discussion is nra propaganda . 
  and there is the bs argument about the nazis again . 
  the population was armed . 
  the nazis did not ban guns , they loosened up the gun-laws for germans . 
  the only group that had to give up their guns were the jews in 1938 , after the big pogrom-night ( reichtskristallnacht ) . 
  this is another popular myth/lie that is being propagated by americans . 
  you just try to justify the american homicide by pointing to the holocaust and the war ( which is a crap comparison anyway ) . 
  every single life lost because of the loose gun-laws in one life too much . 
  period . 
  i didn \u00b4 t mention the alt-right , you did . 
  bavaria does not have all the economy in it . 
  funny how some try to fabricate a `` movement '' where there is none . 
  also , i have seen plenty of support for catalan independence around here as well ( as well as people who oppose it ) . 
  stop with the ridiculous `` everyone against the uk '' meme . 
  if the people of bavaria actually wanted independence , i would say : let them leave . 
  http://www.20min.ch/ausland/news/story/us-buergerwehr-warnt-vor-unruhen-nach-wahlen-20848598 militias preparing in case hillary clinton won the election, 
  because some people would like to see germany having the same problem as spain or the uk , having a `` separatist region '' . 
  as you said , it has no momentum . 
  i first want to see the video of someone with a knife killing thousands , i will wait as well . 
  the point was of course that it is much easier to kill a huge number of people with an ak , be it 10 or 100 people . 
  the 1000 people number of course is unrealistic , but its even more unrealistic with a knife . 
  well , you may have missed the armed para-military groups that were preparing them selfs for a civil war just before last years election . 
  you are really using batman as an example ?!, 
  a fictional superhero ?!, 
  this is so easy : do you know who batman is fighting ? 
  criminals . 
  do you know what is their major `` tool '' ? 
  guns !, 
  sorry , but i am immune to the nra bs propaganda . 
  don \u00b4 t be ridiculous . 
  yes , a knifes can be used to kill too , as can many other tools . 
  but a normal knife is a pretty bad tool for killing people , opposed to something like a sword or a dagger , which are weapons . 
  kill thousands with a knife ? 
  ha , sure . 
  try it . 
  kill thousands with a ak ? 
  with enough ammunition , childs play . 
  sorry , but this is like arguing with a child . 
  rifles/guns are made for killing . 
  knifes , no . 
  they can kill , but they are generally not made for killing per se . 
  there are knifes that are , but these are also considered weapons and thus restricted here in germany . 
  a gun is not intended to be a tool , its intended to be a weapon . 
  a weapon that enables easy mass murder . 
  and what enables gangs and drug * wars * ? 
  much easier to be a criminal when guns are readily available . 
  an armed populace is also the best enabler for vigilante justice , anarchy and civil war . 
  would you prefer `` former yugoslav republic of little bulgaria '' ? 
  don \u00b4 t be sad !, 
  every time i think about greece , i first think about gyros and democracy . 
  so there are people who think different . 
  actually , you were annexed by greece and did not notice . 
  russia , andorra , san marino and monaco can not into continent . 
  savage !, 
  now you are stealing the jokes as well !, 
  don \u00b4 t steal our thing !, 
  we are the ones who want to be ashamed of it ... 
  what and where is the `` miniatur wunderland '' ? 
  never heard of it . 
  they are not good at keeping their state together , but their statistics are first grade !, 
  i know , my post was a little bit sarcastic on this . 
  energiewende is absolutely necessary , but its execution was/is just bad . 
  in the long term , it will pay off . 
  next step : getting rid of coal . 
   every western policy regarding the syrian conflict those do not include tolerating the is ( okay , at least they don \u00b4 t do it anymore ) and attacking ypg , the most important force in the fight against the is . 
  turkey is playing its own game in syria . 
  as does everyone . 
  syria is a disaster . 
  importing cheap french atomic energy , exporting green energy to all other neighbors ( except belgium ) ... energiewende works !, 
  :-d what up with greece and poland though ... 
  the southern european hate , i can understand . 
  but why czech , hungarians and austrians ? 
  small one on an elevated position , because we have dogs : http://i.imgur.com/sckodbt.jpg, 
  how about you stop pulling `` facts '' out of your ass ? 
  http://i.imgur.com/1oe5wsi.jpg ( source : https://www.bka.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/publikationen/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/2015/pks2015jahrbuch.pdf;jsessionid=7f1e824dae5e349ff2ec13ff24e8e115.live0612?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=4 ) around 40 % of all crimes ( by migrants ) in 2015 were committed by eastern/south-eastern european migrants . 
  compared with 25 % from muslimic countries , and 18,5 % from the countries you named ( turkey & north african countries ) . 
  oh , and that turks have the highest value is very suprising . 
  i guess it has nothing to do with the fact that they are the biggest group of migrants in germany . 
  stop spreading these lies !, 
  that 's bogus . 
  these settlement are on territory outside of israel controlled by israeli troops , they do nothing for defense . 
  they are just land grab , nothing more . 
  this would be unacceptable anywhere else , but for israel i guess different rules apply ... 
  well , in germany , the increase in crime in the last decade was mainly attributable to people from eastern europe ... 
  nationalism is the past , you just ca n't let go . 
  i love the christmas truce .
