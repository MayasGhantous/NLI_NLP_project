  such a beautiful display of humanity , defying the inhuman war for a few days . 
  sure , i will search the ~ 10,000 threads of this subreddit now ( on christmas eve ) for you to find the examples . 
  sorry , but it is almost gift-opening time now ... 
  in every topic about refugees coming with boats , there is someone who says this . 
  of course its the only correct course of action , i don \u00b4 t disagree . 
   i have n't seen people talking about drowning them in the sea here but in my opinion after being rescued those people should be on the next ferry back where they came from . 
  but i do disagree with that , everyone has a right to apply for asylum . 
  they should be shipped back if they don \u00b4 t get asylum . 
  because otherwise , its impossible for `` real '' refugees to even reach europe . 
  making the situation better at home is not that easy when the country is in war and anarchy ( like syria & libya ) . 
  easier said than done . 
  who says `` kill them '' ? 
  people in this subreddit , repeatedly . 
  `` let them drown/sink their ships in the mediterranean , that will keep them away '' . 
  its murder , but i guess as long as it is done in the name of `` fortress europe '' it is justified instantly . 
  with the near east as a region of crisis and israels constant action against a peaceful solution to the conflict , it seems really strange the un would try to act on this ... 
  but logic was never the strength of the right . 
  right ? 
  hahaha , sure , i am 200 % against israel and a `` goose stepper '' / s the un is also very anti-israel , it seems . 
  every illegal , injust action is valid of course as long as it is against mulims/arabs . 
  the hypocrisy is disgusting . 
  its blindness and egoism . 
  don \u00b4 t expect them to have a solution but to say `` kill em all '' . 
  for a start , the illegal land-grab that is the continued construction of settlements on the territory of the west bank , effectively trying to prevent a 2 state solution , which is the only solution there is . 
  and no , israel does not need these settlements to `` defend itself '' . 
  this is of course ignoring that israel is completely different from europe in one important way : israel is an oppressive force for the people of palestine . 
  they committed and commit injustice against the palestines , which of course fuels the intifada , so even normal palestine people becomes terrorist very easily . 
  they create their own terrorism . 
  the european nations are not doing the same thing as israel . 
  so only a tiny , tiny percentage of muslims will act as terrorists here . 
  also , i would like to mention that israel is surrounded by countries hostile to it . 
  i have read something a while ago on israel and how they shifted to the extreme right . 
  it was basically this : germans decided after the war/holocaust : never be perpetrators of such injustice ever again . 
  the people of israel however came to a much different conclusion : never be victims again . 
  thus , they now have become perpetrators of injustice them self . 
  but ... rome can \u00b4 t be doomed . 
  what about muh roman empire ? 
  apparently so . 
  we didn \u00b4 t notice that we did . 
  sorry about that . 
  nah , it still would look a little weird . 
  add southern tyrol too , and alsace , then it would look better . 
  while we are at it , luxemburg and eupen/malmedy . 
  oops . 
  did i just reveal the ~ ~ master ~ ~ merkel plan ? 
  oh , do n't let the swiss see this ... you will be banned from ever traveling there . 
  gives you a nice feeling of `` i am poor '' if you shop there . 
  and we have aldi s\u00fcd here ... 
   frankfurt hm ... its a nice shot , but somehow it looks very `` model '' like . 
  wrong . 
  see : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5jj7dd/berlin_police_looking_for_suspect_from_tunis/dbgtsvc/ its not that simple sometimes . 
  he was supposed to be deported in the summer , but as i just read , tunesia denied that he was a tunesian citizen and refused to send his legal documents . 
  without them , the deportation had to be delayed . 
  tunesia is not considered a safe country of origin , as far as i know . 
  he apparently migrated to italy in 2012 , came to germany in 2015 and filed a asylum-plea in 2016 . 
  it seems he had connections with abu walaa , who was recently arrested and is often described as `` isis number 1 guy in germany '' . 
  but gyros is sooo much better ... 
  pandoro !, 
  stop the raisins !, 
  i live in the `` weck ( en ) '' area in hesse ... i do n't know anyone who uses that word . 
  everybody says `` br\u00f6tchen '' . 
  also , i think in franken they do n't say semmel . 
  i have heard them use the word `` weckla '' instead . 
  this map is weird . 
  you were joking too ? 
  that makes two of us . 
  1795 , best year of my life . 
  don \u00b4 t forget eupen/malmedy to germany . 
  hey guys , don \u00b4 t fight over names . 
  if you can \u00b4 t agree , just use the german names , that way no one wins !, 
   is n't that an insult to historic french people who actually are french ? 
  no , it isn \u00b4 t. 
  no one who isn \u00b4 t a serious racist would see it as an insult . 
  we can \u00b4 t just ignore these feelings , as warranted or unwarranted as they might be . 
  these feelings lead to political decisions that are very problematic for the west ( thus bringing us back to the original question by / u/tyzan11 / , why russia is a threat ) . 
  another example : after prussia won the german war of 1866 , the prussian king wanted to take advantage of the austrian defeat and annex huge parts of austrian territory ( for example , bohemia and moravia ) . 
  bismark urged him not to do it ( because he feared that france or russia might step in ) . 
  as questionable as bismark sometimes is , this was wise . 
  the humiliation of the austrians would only lead into a long , neverending feud . 
  to kick your enemy in the gut when he is laying down is not wise . 
  in fascism , the state doesn \u00b4 t necessarily own everything . 
  states in fascism can have a big military and they might take property if they need it , but in principal , private property can still exist . 
  the nazis for example didn \u00b4 t nationalize everything , instead , they worked together with the rich elite . 
  on of the first things they did was to ban free unions , which was of course very welcomed by the rich capital owners . 
   yes , capitalism has lots of problems but at least it can be reformed peacefully ( or so i hope ) i guess we will see about that . 
  the crisis we have right now speaks against the reformability of capitalism . 
  problem is that capitalism & democracy are not as closely connected as people thought in the past . 
  capitalism works very well with dictatorships , if not better ( see china , singapore ) , which are seen as examples to follow by developing countries around the world . 
  this new wave of `` authoritarian capitalism '' is really worrying . 
  it might lead into fascism after all ... 
  thats a difficult debate , because there are many factors at play . 
  for one , castros cuba is also constructed after the example of the soviet system , which already is a huge flaw in itself . 
  its also to consider that the country is/was very isolated , especially after 1990 , when its biggest supporter disappeared . 
  its no wonder that a country under a trade-blockade by the usa is very poor . 
  communism/socialism/whatever you want to call it - i think it will have a comeback at some point in the future ( just like neo-fascism at the moment ) . 
  right now , the wounds in eastern europe are still very deep from the soviet years . 
  the current market system has many problems , we already see the boundaries of that system . 
  major problem is that this system is made for growth , but in a world that is starting to become very overpopulated and also , polluted , growth will be a problem in the future . 
  you are mostly talking about stalinism though which is the foundation for all the `` communist '' crimes and tragedies in the 20th century . 
  in the 90s , after the soviet union collapsed , russia had a period of extreme economic crisis ( which is normal , considering they transformed a planned economy to capitalism ) .
