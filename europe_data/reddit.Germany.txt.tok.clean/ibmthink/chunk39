  70 m \u00b2 are sometimes 1000 and sometimes 1300 . 
  the salaries in frankfurt are really high , thanks to the banks . 
  but i am a student , so i can \u00b4 t really pay these prices ... 
  renting prizes are ok in smaller towns , but crazy in the big cities right now . 
  i would like to move to frankfurt for example , but getting an affordable flat is basically impossible . 
  for 550 $ , you get like 20 m \u00b2 there . 
  yeah . 
  thats true , it depends where you are . 
  though the economical situation in germany also helps right now . 
  unless you have property somewhere really far away from any big city , the housing market can be crazy . 
  in my town , there are new houses being constructed at many spots . 
  these are mostly very expensive flats . 
  germanys result doesn \u00b4 t surprise me . 
  inheritance tax is really laughable , and the politicians ( mainly the cdu/csu ) do everything in their power to keep it that way . 
  in germany , you either own property and are wealthy . 
  or you don \u00b4 t and you have to struggle . 
  my grandparents and their parents were almost all refugees from various parts of eastern europe ( mainly sudeten ) , so , all the property my family had is now someone else \u00b4 s ( if it even exists anymore ) . 
  not that i complain about that loss , but there is a real difference to the people whose families live here for much longer . 
  fair enough . 
  though i don \u00b4 t think the prussians really considered the polish subhumans . 
  they wanted germanization ( which was a common process in other countries as well , see magyarization ) , but the subhuman thing was more `` nazi related '' . 
  i am convinced there would have been at least one world war anyway . 
  but maybe history could have been different if the german revolution of 1848 would have been successful . 
  because after that , german society turned away from liberalism . 
  prussia was the founding state of the new german state , and this state inherited all the nationalism , conservatism and authoritarianism . 
   france and uk did n't do nothing , they declared war on your ass . 
  not mine , i wasn \u00b4 t there . 
  anyway , a declaration of war means nothing if it is not backed by some action . 
  look , i don \u00b4 t say france sacrificed nothing . 
  france just had shit generals and strategy , your army could have prevented the downfall of the country . 
  sometimes offense really is the best defense . 
   deserve better than americans insults 24/7/365 . 
  in their medias , in their movies , everywhere . 
  this is really insulting . 
  [ you mean like this ? 
  ] ( http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/116880/2989264-7076132903-capta.jpg ) yes , this is very ignorant . 
   it is n't important enough for top dogs to fight over . 
  it is important , because it has a very strategical-important position - between europe and the middle east , also the bosporus , which controls the entrance to the black sea . 
  thats why they are ( still ) in nato . 
  the us let them in because their strategical position against the ussr ( now russia ) . 
  still , if the eu wanted , it could seriously harm turkey with economic sanctions . 
  i was not talking about defensive action . 
  france / britain wasted the time window they had to attack germany , and then got steamrolled . 
  but you had british support , which could have helped in such a case . 
  i bet if the wehrmacht didn \u00b4 t aid the italians , you could have even attacked italy . 
  in germany , it seems the afd gets the biggest share of votes from the middle aged group ( genx , baby-boomer ) , while its pretty weak with older people ( 68er generation ) . 
  there is the difference : that is impossible in germany . 
  you have to be a party to run for the national elections . 
  single independent candidates can run in the elections , but only for the direct seats ( first vote ) , which are decided with a fptp voting system ( practically impossible to win as a independent , never really happens ) . 
  to really take part in the election , you need the second votes - for which only parties can compete . 
  lies !, 
  gyros master race !, 
  don \u00b4 t commit sacrilege against the name of gyros !, 
  yes , that is true . 
  france and the british should have stepped in sooner . 
  also would have saved france from getting occupied . 
  french army certainly was strong enough to seriously threaten west germany . 
  winning elections doesn \u00b4 t mean `` acting in the interest of people '' . 
  the base is insane ? 
  the base is the most important part of a party . 
  without it , the party has no core and not footing in the population . 
  i know there was a baltic tribe called prussians , but i was talking about german prussians ( yes , they were also just called `` prussians '' . 
  you can \u00b4 t blame all of germany for the actions of the prussians , they were just one of the many german states at the time . 
  its like if i would blame all the people of poland for some actions of the citizens of krakau . 
   i think napoleon wanted to annex contested territories not german homeland . 
  nope . 
  look at this map : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/rheinbund_1812%2c_political_map.png/896px-rheinbund_1812%2c_political_map.png for comparison , the german empire , first unified german state , that was formed roughly 60 years later : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/deutsches_reich_%281871-1918%29-de.svg/1108px-deutsches_reich_%281871-1918%29-de.svg.png and todays federal republic : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/deutschland_politisch_2010.png he annexed huge parts of west and north germany . 
  all the territory west of the rhine , despite no french living there , with cities like cologne , bonn ( later a german capitol ! ) . 
  and the north with germanys second biggest city ( today ) hamburg . 
  these were not the least bit `` contested '' territories . 
  well , they glanced over the siegfried line angrily , but nothing more ( phoney war ) . 
  the declaration of war was essentially meaningless , if they would have seriously attacked western/northern germany , hitler would have been in trouble and he would not have managed to conquer europe as quickly . 
  hell , they might have defeated germany completely . 
  but , didn \u00b4 t happen . 
  ( granted , poland would still have fallen , they couldn \u00b4 t have prevented that ), 
  mhm , that would be nice , but the eu in this story might be france and britain at the beginning of the second world war , where both did nothing to save poland . 
  i think to say mhp is kemalist is a bit incorrect . 
  chp was actually founded by atat\u00fcrk , so it really the most kemalist party there is . 
  mhp is nationalistic ( and maybe a puppet party of erdogan now ) . 
   he found a loophole in the laws , what he owns is the brand . 
  pretty sure he would have been able to do the same in any other european country . 
  doubt it . 
  you couldn \u00b4 t `` own '' the brand cdu or spd , because parties have to be a citizen organization according to the party law . 
  someone other than the party owing the brand would not comply with that . 
  party laws in germany can be pretty strict . 
  i will take two , but only if some greeks stay - i want to get served gyros when i visit there . 
  macedonia of course - in the tradition of not-a-slav alexander the great . 
  yep , thanks . 
  stupid autocorrect . 
  basic problem with all parties to a certain extend . 
  the leadership is separated from the base , its the leadership who decides and `` betrays '' the interests of the base and people . 
  italy has no clearly defined law on parties . 
  m5s is grillos property , so he can decide what happens in the name of his `` movement '' . 
  this would be impossible here in germany , no one can simply `` own '' a party . 
  how about this - plot twist : greece is the poland of this story . 
  mhp also supports this . 
  sorry liberal/secular turks , but you are screwed . 
  migration might be the best option . 
  all hail sultan recep !, 
  lol , what stupid arrogance .
