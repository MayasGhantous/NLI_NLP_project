  erdogan is no secular , so it will be more like islamic-light dictatorship . 
  on a more positive note , i think the market for erdogan-statues is going to increase exponentially !, 
  there is real opportunity here . 
  see you on the other side , turkey . 
  eastern europe lived through stalinism , you will live through erdogan-ism as well . 
  its not a real word , just multiple words glued together . 
  sure , he made it look like an over the top patriotic thing on purpose . 
  but one must be really dumb to think he honestly says thanks for `` windows me , diabetes typ 2 and bill cosby '' . 
  or `` thanks for lowering the bar '' . 
  thats in your face level irony . 
  i thought it was us germans who didn \u00b4 t understand irony ... 
  great , now i have an ohrwurm ...  let \u00b4 s walk hand in hand into isolation !, 
  hell yeah , lets do it !, 
  good luck next week . 
  this could be the big-bang-finish to 2016 so badly needed . 
  mostly the north and the west . 
  see : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czs6jnamfw the english just changed it in modern english from the old system . 
  why would they though ? 
  what would they gain ? 
  great leap forward into the atlantic ocean . 
  well ... as a city state , singapur is a different case . 
  being a major trade hub also helps . 
  democracy is very important for a truly successful , modern state . 
  because in a dictatorship , the aura of fear and supression limits the potential of the economy and the civil development . 
  germany at risk ? 
  maybe the is tries to attack us , but they also are a risk for turkey and all other western nations besides germany . 
  pkk , dhkp-c and the g\u00fclen movement present no risk for us currently . 
  he tolerated the is on his territory long enough . 
  erdogan is a massive hypocrite . 
  no , he is not . 
  uhm ... why is this situation germanys fault ? 
  why are you not angry at the food companies , the real culprits here ? 
  nutella is a special case . 
  its also different here in germany compared with italy . 
  likely would have happened . 
   well , ultimately the only thing that can and will fix it is the free market the question is , how . 
   you could obviously make it a law that they 'd have to sell the same product they do elsewhere , but then your violating the primary principle of the free market why should we care about that ? 
  regulation is not a bad thing , there are tons of useful regulations in the eu and the food-sector already . 
  maybe he means that czech representatives were invited to the paulskirchenparlament , which discussed at the time how big the future german nation state should be . 
  kleindeutsch ( without austria ) or gro\u00dfdeutsch ( with austria ) . 
  not sure , but maybe a state with the inclusion of bohemia and moravia was also discussed . 
  i would love to ditch google , problem is , other search engines just aren \u00b4 t as good . 
  bing for example doesn \u00b4 t have as many feature , nor are the search results as good . 
  even we do n't want that , so i guess we have to sell it somewhere . 
  germany : the empire strikes back ( via supermarket ), 
  well , that 's a given , i guess . 
  they also suck at making baguette . 
  but , the traditional german bread ( sauerteig ) is often very good . 
  they are not necessarily german companies . 
  last time i checked , coca cola ( one example from the article ) was american . 
  its just that the food companies , german or not , serve the german market with a different , better product . 
  problem is this is not a free market . 
  food market also is a market with relatively high entrance barriers , not as high as electronics , but high enough . 
  just jump-starting a new food company that produces high-quality food isn \u00b4 t that easy , as you face established competition . 
  its a very idealistic view of capitalism , which does not reflect the reality . 
  eastern europe had a long stalinist-socialist rule . 
  the transition to capitalism in the 90s was rapid , too fast for many formerly state-owned companies . 
  so these markets were easy `` prey '' for established western companies . 
  we had the same phenomenon in east germany . 
  east germany still is behind the west , not many of their companies have survived . 
  at least in terms of east germany , the western part subsidized the east with so much money , so the negative effects are smaller then in other formerly eastern block countries . 
   but we do get those eu handouts in form of infrastructure projects , so there 's that . 
  so at least you can build nice 6 lane freeways ... to drive on them with 130 km/h . 
  hey guys : want to join germany ( again ) ? 
  you will get our high-quality food and no speed limit !, 
  see , its all a ploy to get the east back ... edit : downvoters - too dumb to recognize an obvious joke , it seems . 
  every country has strengths and weaknesses when it comes to food quality , because of tradition and culture . 
  hungary for example , has very high-quality salami , but other sausage products ( like ham ) often isn \u00b4 t as good as in germany ( from my experiences , anyway ) . 
  its not that easy though if there are no alternatives with higher quality . 
  markets only work when people have a choice . 
  if the companies don \u00b4 t give consumers choice , its not gon na work . 
  other example : try buying laptops with a non-widescreen display ( like old 4:3 laptops - display ratio with more vertical space is better for reading ) . 
  you can \u00b4 t , because the companies don \u00b4 t make any more models . 
  its the same thing here : the food companies just use cheaper ingredients in general for these markets . 
  sure , you can say `` well , don \u00b4 t buy it '' - thats not gon na happen . 
  in a dream world , customers would buy local products instead . 
  but thats a dream world . 
  in the end , they are at the mercy of the food companies . 
  this is where governments might have to step in . 
  one common market , should also mean common quality . 
  can confirm this , when i visited poland and czech republic , some of the food you would buy in the supermarket generally seemed of a lower quality compared to our food . 
  while not being cheaper as well . 
   the far-right is not the perfect solution , but depressingly enough , it 's the least bad solution currently . 
  yeah , right . 
  look at hungary . 
  those guys are doing great with their fidesz far-right government , with massive corruption , `` enhanced '' press-freedom and militarization of the society ... 
   the left and left wing influence are responsible for the mess in europe at the moment how ? 
  most of the time , center right or center governments were in power in the last 30 years or so , all around europe . 
  how is the left responsible for their actions ? 
  the turnaround towards neoliberalism certainly was not a creation of the left . 
  well , the parent company of the paper is now owned by opimus , a company owned by an oligarch and close friend of orban . 
  coincidence much ? 
  not long ago , a police officer was murdered by a known-dangerous neonazi , after the two officers were ordered to question him about illegal weapons ( without any concern for their safety ) : http://observer.com/2016/10/putins-support-for-europes-far-right-just-turned-lethal/ neonazis roam free in hungary . 
  there also was a different incident , in september two policemen were injured in a bomb-explosion - the police later arrested a suspect with a right-wing background . 
  meanwhile , fidesz does nothing against it . 
  [ orban remains silent about this incident ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ungarn-razzia-bei-nazi-organisation-polizist-erschossen-a-1118371.html ) . 
  on the contrary , they seem to ignore the rise of fascism in the country , because its is orbans real ideology ( `` illiberal democracy '' is nonexistent ) . 
  what fidesz does : - ** militarize society : ** the government wants to introduce more military training classes ( the reason : young people have to learn patriotism and willingness to sacrifice them self for the `` national cause '' ) , increase military spending and recruit more soldiers . 
  it also backs private militia forces , which undermine the state-monopoly of violence . 
  - ** attack the welfare state : ** welfare-receivers are powerless in face of increasingly powerful government officials , who \u00b4 s task is to check the receivers for tidiness and hygiene at home .
