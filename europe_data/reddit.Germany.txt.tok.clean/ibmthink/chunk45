  mhga - make hungary ~ ~ great ~ ~ giant again ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  meanwhile , erdogan wants a revision of lausanne ( a treaty which was much better for turkey than sevres ) . 
  the world is crazy . 
  german justice system is build on the foundation of re-socialization . 
  so if he gets out depends on if he can be de-radicalized or not . 
  if there is an apparent danger for society there is the preventive detention . 
  yes , this system has its error-margin , its not perfect . 
  but which system is ? 
  the us system certainly is not . 
  i would argue that it produces many more problems , though different kind of problems . 
  who knows , they don \u00b4 t do statistics on this topic in poland . 
  there are people however who do convert to islam in poland , although its a rather small community . 
  no wonder , as poland is a country with a very strong catholic influence . 
  and converts are stigmatized as traitors . 
  it is not , you can get a life sentence for it . 
  final judgment however depends on the severity of the crime . 
  considering the severity of his crimes ( high reason , disclosure of informations , plotting a terrorist attack ) , i don \u00b4 t think so . 
  the ultimate counter argument . 
  i concede defeat ... / s i guess trying to explain how japan is very different from western countries is fruitless here ... edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_japan#muslim_demographics so there are people converting to islam in japan . 
  you know , there is this little thing called `` the internet '' , which spans worldwide . 
  you do n't actually need muslims in your country to get converts . 
  its all available for everyone in the web . 
  a european converting to islam in secret and then infiltrating the verfassungsschutz ? 
  totally would have stopped that with his magical anti-islam powers . 
  yeah , right . 
  give them the opportunity to cause more damage . 
  and also , you ca n't do this with europeans . 
  yes , tragic . 
  however , you have no alternative solution in mind , besides killing him . 
  that is not possible in this country , for good reasons too . 
  we will see what he gets . 
  high treason can be punished with a life sentence , so its definitely possible . 
  guess what , we are not the us . 
  not sure if this helps renzi or if it damages him ... 
  20-40 % is a pretty wide span . 
  could be close to 40 % , but also to 20 % . 
  of course more and more people become atheists also in the west , though there is a big difference between cities and rural areas . 
  so i guess you are partly right , but the east definitely should not be dismissed . 
  its a factor , yes , but the biggest reason is east germany , which has many atheists due to its history . 
  look at this map , it shows where most atheists live : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:konfessionslos_zensus_2011.png?uselang=de i think i have once read that east germany is the region with the highest density of atheists . 
  yeah , i also think more people should leave the catholic church , 28,9 % is a bit too high . 
  it would be nice if both protestant and catholic numbers would drop to 25 % at least ... 
  50 years ago , people had just as many prejudices and would tell you how italians , hungarians , french are inherently `` different '' from us . 
  see , i don \u00b4 t buy this bullshit . 
  culture is used in the context as a substitution for the word `` race '' , because this word is bad now . 
  what you really want to say `` they are a different race and don \u00b4 t fit in here '' . 
  different from you , i don \u00b4 t believe that human beings can be assigned a value based on their blood . 
  there are more than enough people who a ethnic german i have nothing in common with and who i don \u00b4 t want to know . 
  just as there may be someone from japan , south america or the middle east i might have more in common with in terms of my worldview , job , class-standing etc. 
  and btw : don \u00b4 t tell me why `` my mother can integrate easily '' . 
  she lived all her life here in this country and doesn \u00b4 t even speak hungarian besides a few words . 
  guess what : that she has 50 % hungarian blood has absolutely no meaning for anything really . 
  but she is still marked as `` migration background '' because of it . 
  you learned that just today ? 
  :-p i have known that for years !, 
  you swallowed the racist pill too often i think . 
  just an example : my mother is 50 % german , 50 % hungarian . 
  so she is really a german 100 % , because my grandpa , a magyar , came here in the 50s and is completely integrated . 
  in statistics , she counts as having a migration background . 
  according to you , this is a problem . 
  no accident though : the east of germany was once majority protestant land . 
  because of the anti-religion policies in the gdr , this changed and now many people in the east are konfessionslos / have no religion . 
  yes . 
  if you owe a bank 1 $ , you have a problem . 
  if you owe the bank 1 million $ , the bank has a problem . 
  which will happen in 20-50 years maybe , if ever again . 
  no , because deutsch means something like `` by the people/from the people '' . 
  so deutsch is the language `` of the people '' , opposed to latin , which is the language of romans . 
  nope . 
  its obvious this thread is brigaded . 
  suddenly , when immigration topics come up , anyone who does n't propagate the far right trash is downvoted . 
  this thread is a good example , and i am not the only one who notices it . 
  what i wrote above is not unreasonable or even far left in any way . 
  and europeans are not as weapon crazy as americans . 
  http://www.faceofanation.co/ and its one ugly abomination ... 
  the map is right though . 
  mark means `` borderland '' . 
  dan/den/d \u00e4n is said to be associated with german tenne , english den which means `` low ground '' . 
  so flat borderlands sounds about right . 
  well , the fighting has to be done somewhere ... / s, 
  i think its still better than `` country of men '' or do you like `` shape , form '' better ? 
  not in a thread brigaded like this one . 
  comedy gold . 
  especially belgium : `` people who swell with anger '' . 
  also , romania = roman empire confirmed . 
  do you mean real football or the american kind ? 
  not going to question that . 
  people are different . 
  i am just against this fear-mongering and the demonizing of a complete world-region . 
  also , if we are talking about immigration , thats a completely different story from asylum of course . 
  immigration can be and should be selective . 
  germany is a terrible example for this . 
  for one , people were definitely not unarmed back then , which goes completely against your theory . 
  the thing is , the nazis didn \u00b4 t really do a coup top-down , their rule was accepted and wanted by very large parts of the german populace back then . 
  they really `` came into power legally '' , as they wanted - they won the last free elections ( not 100 % , but mostly free ) , had a coalition majority and also managed to pass the erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz with the votes of the conservative parties . 
  the little real opposition there was was quickly destroyed , first the communists and then the social democrats . 
  they also had the backing of the reichspr\u00e4sident hindenburg , which was a very powerful position in weimar republic . 
  the system allowed them to take over very easily , because it did not have proper checks and balances . 
  so it doesn \u00b4 t really serve as an example for your theory , in which there is a top-down coup against the will of the people . 
  many people wanted this , the overwhelming majority quickly accepted it .
