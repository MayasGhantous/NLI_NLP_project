  they also serve as supervisors in local state work programs . 
  the goal , maximal pressure on the welfare receivers . 
  - ** attack on press-freedom : ** https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56kz5k/hungarian_opposition_daily_n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g_shut_down/ < - the government was behind this , as many other cases where independent news-outlets suddenly disappear . 
  fidesz is prime example for a far right government . 
  they shall not be allowed to masquerade as anything else . 
  also typical eu : denounce everyone whose opinion you do not like as scientifically illiterate puppets of russia . 
  ireland volunteers to take all the nuclear waste ? 
  thats great !, 
  smart nations look into the past as well , not to find a hero , but wisdom , which helps the nation to perform even better in the future . 
  bismark , a hero nowadays ? 
  not really . 
  he is seen as a smart leader , but he also is seen critical for certain aspects ( like the spread of militarism ) . 
  i think needing a hero from the past is the sign of a weak nation , with a serious lack of self-esteem . 
  i would rather tax sugar drinks higher . 
  actually , what you did was the whataboutism , since this thread is about chinas unfair policies , not about `` germany buying up southern europe '' . 
  how much of the poland we gon na buy ? 
  all . 
  we gon na buy all the poland . 
  is the uk the trojan horse for everyone ? 
  russia , china and the us ? 
   do n't try to artificially manipulate the market !!, 
  go ahead and tell that to the chinese . 
  they will laugh at you . 
  you are about as ignorant and delusional as the guys in the video . 
  yes , we will be able to abolish it , if the constitutional court decides so . 
  it was one of the requirements the court did set for ceta . 
  if it turns out that it is against the constitution ... 
  thats a nice idea . 
  i mean , who wouldn \u00b4 t want to gain parts of the adriatic coast ? 
  ( looking at you serbia ), 
  i think he wants austria to set up its empire again . 
  sure . 
  but its not like they have as much power as in poland . 
  so although they complain , i think most people don \u00b4 t really care . 
  no , don \u00b4 t think so . 
  that being said , many adults do not celebrate halloween in any way , its more a children 's thing , although this could change in the future . 
  halloween is still a fairly new thing around here . 
  if someone is against halloween , its usually the anti-american sentiment ( ala `` we don \u00b4 t want that american crap '' ) . 
  i know . 
  the ominous `` sea-people '' . 
  there are many theories , one is that they came from north-western anatolia and that they were related to luwians . 
  sure he is loyal , but stay in a party that seems broken beyond repair ? 
  seeheimers are still firmly in power in the spd , they dominate it . 
  sch\u00e4uble , always working tireless to enslave all governments to adhere to austerity forever . 
  * one currency to rule them all , one sch\u00e4uble to find them . 
  one euro to bring them all , and in the darkness bind them . 
  the entire generation of policitians we have now is terrible . 
  hopefully , there will be come generational change after 2017 and 2021 . 
  he would fit with the traitor party anyway . 
  do you seriously think he would have joined the spd / not left it after agenda 2010 ? 
  tells you a lot how short the memory of the german people is , with sch\u00e4uble being one of the key people involved in the cdu corruption scandal / spendenskandal . 
  he should never have become the financial minister in the first place . 
  sch\u00e4uble as chancellor would be a nightmare . 
  our country would be set back years . 
  ha , suck it , i am living just outside the borders !, 
  gib anatolia back to the hittites !, 
  the national shame . 
  \u00d6ttinger is boris johnson level embarrasing . 
  china has had some success in their fight against desertification . 
  plant more trees , thats the most obvious step . 
  i know , phillip ii was a nice guy . 
  it was a joke . 
  there are a couple key transformations that set apart the eastern roman empire from the byzantine : - the development of the old antique cities ( poleis ) to much smaller , fortress like kastrons - the change from latin to greek as the official state language - the loss of wealth and territory - change in the state-system ( no more clear seperation between military and civil state organs ), 
  why not ? 
  you would get all the sunny weather and siesta !, 
  ** translation & summary : ** two weeks ago , the biggest regime-critical news-paper of hungary , n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g , was discontinued by its austrian owner . 
  the paper had reported on several fidezs and orban-related corruption scandals before . 
  this tuesday , the parent company of n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g ( mediaworks ) was bought by the opimus press holding , which is controlled by the hungarian oligarch lorinc meszaros , a close friend and companion of victor orban . 
  this marks the latest step in orbans continuous fight against the free press , which started 3 months after orban was elected with a 2/3 majority in 2010 , when he created a government press agency . 
  since then press freedom in hungary has suffered tremendously : - december 2013 : prosiebensat .1 media sells the independent tv sender tv2 to two tv2 managers . 
  now , it belongs to the orban friend andy vajna and is completely on government line . 
  - spring 2015 : the government lowers an advertisement tax , which it established in 2014 . 
  this happens after negotiations with the rtl group . 
  since then , the critical tv channel rtl club reports less critical . 
  - december 2015 : hungarian telekom ( 100 % controlled by german telekom ) sells the critical website origo , which uncovered government corruption scandals before . 
  origo is completely on government line now . 
  mediaworks not only controls n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g , but also twelve popular regional news-papers . 
  it is likely that these papers will now report in favor of the government as well , diverting the attention from fidezs and orbans corruption scandals to the topic of migration . 
  edit : wow , this topic is massively downvoted . 
  seems like some people don \u00b4 t like what goes against their agenda . 
  the differences developed in a couple decades . 
  eastern roman empire mid 7th century was very different from the eastern roman empire mid 6th century . 
  both in the organization of the state and the the official state language , as well as the territory . 
  also religion . 
  sure , they continued to call themself `` roman '' . 
  never said otherwise , but there still are some real differences between the `` early erm '' and the `` late erm '' , wether you want to call it byzantine or not . 
  spain is already separated , carnary islands use wet . 
  maybe that would be an exception . 
  i guess they could consider using different time zones for parts of the country , with catalonia and the balearic islands using cet and the rest of the country using wet . 
  alien attacks from outer space ... i mean russia of course . 
  daylight saving can go , i would rather keep winter time all year . 
  but the time zones should stay as they are now . 
  its not that simple . 
  you can argue that there is a difference between the eastern roman empire and the byzantine empire . 
  most important of all , the byzantine empire used greek as the dominant state language , while the eastern roman empire still used latin . 
  also , its ruler was called basileus and not imperator . 
  its a fluid transition in the early 7th century between the eastern roman empire/late antique and the byzantine empire/early middle-ages . 
  a crucial event in the transition was the loss of the provinces egypt , syria and palestine to the muslim arabs . 
  byzantine empire as well . 
  this is a great idea .
