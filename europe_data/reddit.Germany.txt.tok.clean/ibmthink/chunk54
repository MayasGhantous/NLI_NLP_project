   the original definition of nationalism was that of a political movement aimed at establishing self-governance and sovereignty of a nation over itself , and preserving and developing its culture its the original form of nationalism , as you stated , which also means that there is another form . 
  the extreme form of nationalism that led to two wars in europe . 
  nationalism was useful in the early 19th century and is useful if people are oppressed . 
  however , today in the west its more kind of a disease that blinds people from seeing clearly . 
  there are still many extremist nationalists ( including you ? 
  could be ) who want to return europe to the state of the 1930s , when nationalism still ruled pretty much uncontested . 
  but in an ever more connected world and in the free west , it has no purpose today . 
   the imperial ambitions of some of them were an exception rather than a rule . 
  wrong . 
  its pretty much the same in every country , after the nationalistic movement has won the freedom of the country , it turns towards `` outward enemies '' . 
  which still creates war , conflicts and suffering . 
   there were different reasons , ** the idea that their nation ** / race ( and economic / political system , for soviet russia ) ** is superior ** to others being one of them . 
  however , that is not nationalism oh look , you just summed up extreme nationalism right there . 
   however , that is not nationalism , applies to wwii only , and even then , despite all the rhetoric , the potential economic gains from winning a war played a much bigger role than whatever jingoistic ideas they had . 
  nationalism and imperialism where the key drivers behind wwi . 
  you better start learning history now , because it seems that you know nothing about it . 
  and where did those imperial ambitions came from ? 
  maybe , just maybe , it could be extreme nationalism ? 
  you just want to play the blame game . 
  carry on then . 
  answering that isn \u00b4 t easy because you first have to define what is a fair deal . 
  the eu does have leverage : time . 
  the clock is ticking for the uk since they have activated article 50 . 
  its the uk who has to come to terms with what they want before the eu can make any deal , fair or unfair . 
  if the uk doesn \u00b4 t do that in time , they will drop out hard , with no deal . 
  a deal always involves compromise . 
  i think both sides have to compromise for a fair deal and i think it should be a fair deal . 
  such a deal would include many things the uk doesn \u00b4 t want , such as freedom of movement . 
  the eu will neither be harsh nor will they be favorable towards the uk . 
  its clear however that the uk can \u00b4 t keep the advantages of the eu while getting rid of all its obligations . 
  if you think thats harsh , then i guess the eu is harsh , yes . 
  what ambulance is the eu blocking ? 
  you think the eu not giving the uk an instant trade deal while not getting anything in return is the equivalent of that ? 
  the problem is the expectation in the uk to get a favorable deal , while on the other hand still getting a complete , hard , brexit . 
  thats not how it works . 
  its either a softer brexit and a favorable deal , or a complete , hard brexit - in which case there won \u00b4 t be a good deal . 
  cherrypicking won \u00b4 t work this time . 
  thats a very simplistic interpretation . 
  you are right that the usa don \u00b4 t have much fault here and they came in very late . 
  but the uk and france ? 
  the uk contributed heavily to the arms race before the war started and france was openly hostile towards germany . 
  none of the nations involved tried to stop the chain of events that set this war in motion . 
  everyone had goals and plans , they wanted that war . 
  germany and austria-hungary carry heavy blame . 
  no one should deny that . 
  but the entente isn \u00b4 t innocent . 
  how about every major nation involved ? 
  britain puts itself in trouble . 
  not the eus fault at all . 
  if someone shoots his legs , you can \u00b4 t help him . 
  yes . 
  world war 1 & 2 had absolutely nothing to do with nationalism . 
  it was all the communists , you see . 
  covert operation and cooperation with the jews to destroy the world . 
   where ? 
  is n't europe still the richest region in the world ( aside usa ) ? 
  duh , i wonder why ... maybe its because after two deadly wars europeans stopped fighting , started to work together and rebuild their continent ( with support of the us ) in peace ? 
  you think europe was the richest region after world war 2 ? 
   germans led europe into two wars that almost destroyed europe for good . 
  nationalism ( like the british one , saw the dunkirk ? ), 
  helped us to save it . 
  ah yes , the evil germans . 
  world war 1 , thats completely and only germanys doing , right ? 
  the other nations didn \u00b4 t have any ambitions in that war , germany dragged everyone in . 
  gosh , i have to say , i envy you . 
  with such a simple ( & wrong ) worldview , things have to be so easy . 
   i 'm pretty sure eu forces us to change our demograpic composition by forcing us to accept hundreds of thousands of africans . 
  its alt-right meme time , i see ... not worth wasting anymore time , you are obviously a pepe-bot . 
   but the truth is that all the riches and development in europe are here thanks to national states bullshit claim 1 #  there is no other way , huge artificial states of different groups of people never lead to anything good and eventually ends up in blood bullshit claim 2 # the wealth of europe doesn \u00b4 t come from national states . 
  it comes from technical development and most importantly , the empires that european states could build thanks to technical advances . 
  these empires were `` huge artificial states of different people '' too , but without them , europe would never have become the center of the world . 
  africa is a mess because of those empires - its a mess because european drew the lines pretty much randomly . 
  but to clear this situation , a giant war would be required . 
  as for the `` manipulated fools in europe '' ... ** nationalism led to the downfall of europe ** . 
  nationalism led europeans into two wars that almost destroyed europe for good . 
  if you think peoples are fools because they learned from history that cooperation is better than war , you are the fool . 
  the eu isn \u00b4 t a forced multi-ethical empire like the ottoman empire or the austro-hungarian empire . 
  its a cooperation of free , independent states , all of which are free to leave if they want . 
  well , its the reason trump was elected according to / pol / `` trump triggers leftists and libtards , so he is the best thing ever ! 1 !!! 11 !!!! '', 
  in the early 50s , there was a party called the [ socialist reich party of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_reich_party ) ( srpd ) . 
  this could be considered a successor party of the nsdap , which also explains why it was quickly banned ( the first party to be ever banned in the federal republic ) . 
  last election , even though the three parties had a majority in parliament , spd declared that were would be no coalition with the left before the election . 
  this election , a majority for such a coalition seems unlikely , the spd is just too weak . 
  also , the left and the greens and the spd are far away in many programmatic points , and the greens and the spd are more likely to form a coalition with the cdu . 
  lol . 
  i never thought the day would come that i would have to defend this party , but the afd is not the successor of the nsdap . 
  neither in organization , nor in program ( though they are already far right in parts , they are still not completely on nazi territory ) . 
  and the left , while being a descendant from the sed , is a very different party today . 
  bad move . 
  i don \u00b4 t think the part of the electorate that would vote for the fdp agrees with such comments . 
  he may be trying to attract some afd voters ... which he can try , but this is a special group of people . 
  he would have to go more towards the right to really fish in that group . 
  ah , that must be the good old liberal love for democracy and peace . 
  / s working with dictators ? 
  no problem , as long as they want to do business with us . 
  you mean you will take a higher risk of getting sick for higher profits for the food companies ? 
  i propose we call the sickness you can get from eating eggs with salmonella the `` freedom flu '' . 
  there are meals that are prepared with raw eggs . 
  it makes sense . 
  in germany , this summer wasn \u00b4 t that extreme so far .
