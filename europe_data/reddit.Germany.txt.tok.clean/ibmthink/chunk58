  no , germany doesn \u00b4 t own the eu . 
  but poland and hungary also don \u00b4 t own the eu . 
  and there are treaties that member states have to fulfill certain qualifiers , such as an intact democracy . 
  they don \u00b4 t. 
  they don \u00b4 t even have close to 50 % of the votes , though they still have the majority due to the polish political system . 
  wow , i didn \u00b4 t think this tired lie would come up this fast . 
  but it is a lie , the media covered this event after it became known . 
  local news reported on january 1 ( when it was still assumed that there were only a couple incidents ) , nationwide news on january 2 or 3 . 
  but sure `` cover up '' / `` censorship '' !!! 1 !, 
  yes , professors who are also part of pis are of the opinion that there is no issue . 
  surprising . 
  just like in hungary , where orban and his fidez will claim that hungary is an example for a working democracy ... 
  i don \u00b4 t care if you are impressed with germany or not . 
  that doesn \u00b4 t matter if we are discussing the endangerment of democracy in poland . 
  pis is following orbans footsteps . 
  the eu is no club for authoritarian states , so if pis wants to go back to the worst part of communism ( which is dictatorship ) , feel free to do so , but not in the eu . 
  pretty sure russia doesn \u00b4 t care about democracy , i think they would be delighted to have poland in the eurasian economic union . 
  ah , another pis-bot who spouts government propaganda . 
  the citizens are clowns for protesting ? 
  what a cute insult . 
  `` christian values '' ? 
  the biggest joke . 
  the people who claim they follow `` christian values '' mostly have no idea what those values even are . 
  and the meme about `` left leaning '' media . 
  there is a variety of media in western countries , some left ( well , liberal mostly , not socialist ) and some right leaning . 
  as it is in a country with free media . 
  there is no censorship in western europe . 
  but i think there is in poland , because pis controls the state owned media companies . 
  of course , being a supporter of pis , i guess thats fine for you . 
  biased media is ok as long as it confirms my opinion , am i right ? 
  the bird in the lufthansa logo is a crane , not an eagle . 
  see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_germany#/media/file:flag_of_the_holy_roman_empire_ ( 1200-1350 ) . svg no one in germany knows this flag . 
  lol , yes , looks like it . 
  well actually , i think its supposed to be the stylized wing of an eagle . 
   also , france looks like a penis or a middle finger ... 
  the german one is ugly imho . 
  and very disconnected with modern germany ... the old war flag of the hre looks too much like the danish flag and no one in germany knows this old war flag . 
  i like the hungarian , ukrainian and maltese flags . 
  it kinda was run by conservatives . 
  conservatives in the communist party that is , who tried to preserve stalins system at any cost . 
  thats why the `` communist '' leaders got older and older in the ussr , the old leaders didn \u00b4 t want to give up power , because it meant that things might change if younger people would take over . 
  see gerontocracy in the ussr : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerontocracy the first one to break this system was gorbatchov ... who was also the last leader of the ussr . 
  you are missing the point of this map , which is not communism , but the fall of european inter-war-period democracies and their transformation into authoritarian , right wing dictatorships . 
  i have seen this kind of map in history books at the side of a text about woodrow wilson and his goals , one of which was to turn the monarchistic europe of the pre-ww1-era into a democratic europe . 
  this map is to illustrate the failure of his goal . 
  europe got rid of many dynasties , but democracy was too fragil . 
  coloring the ussr in the same colors as nazi germany would also be misleading , because these were very different regimes with different ideologies . 
  you mean italy and bulgaria would have gotten more territories ? 
  greece was fighting against the axis , why would your country be rewarded in case of such an invasion ? 
  the problem is , you are mixing things up . 
  one thing is the form of state ( republican vs. monarchic ) , another is the form of government ( democratic vs. authoritarian ) . 
  a monarchy can be a democracy , like the uk , the netherlands etc. 
  a republic can be a authoritarian dictatorship , like portugal under salazar : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estado_novo_ ( portugal ) . 
  china is a dictatorship , yet , its still a republic . 
  even nazi germany was still a republic , because there was no monarch . 
  hitler formally derived his power from the german people . 
  not from god . 
  agreed . 
  we have good schnitzels in germany , but we are not even close to austria \u00b4 s schnitzel perfection . 
  of course . 
  as an absolute monarch , his powers are similar to a dictators power . 
  but , he derives his power from `` divine will '' or hereditary rule . 
  a dictator has power because he says because the people wanted it ( which doesn \u00b4 t have to be true , of course ) , so he took over power to `` obey the peoples will/bring things back to order/insert another excuse to take over '' . 
  and where do you take that definition from ? 
  dictatorships are also republics , in most cases at least . 
  a republic is a state in which the head of the state isn \u00b4 t a monarch . 
  how it is decided who is head of the state - by election or some form of appointment - is not defined through the republican state-organization . 
  a king can \u00b4 t be a dictator . 
  his power is based on hereditary rule or because `` god gave him the power '' . 
  so no , / u/tiajm \u00b4 s example doesn \u00b4 t stand , unfortunately . 
  you can \u00b4 t call the king of bhutan a dictator , just as you can \u00b4 t call any of the kings of the middle ages a dictator . 
  ancient rome was a republic , at least until the rule of octavian . 
  the dictator was not a king . 
  that distinction was very important , because the romans got rid of their line of kings and were absolutely against kings . 
  thats why octavian/augustus didn \u00b4 t call himself king/rex . 
  rather , he was the princeps , as he tried to preserve the illusion that the republic still existed . 
  no , you are completely wrong . 
  dictatorship may be able to decide faster , but those decisions are also more likely more ineffective . 
  fast decision-making does not equate with wise , efficient and effective decision making . 
  decisions in democracy take longer , but in the end , the output will likely be better for society . 
  he is a king , not a dictator . 
  monarchy = !, 
  republic . 
   a dictatorship will always be able to govern more effectvely than a democracy , period no . 
  a very bad and wrong generalization . 
  a weak dictatorship will govern much less effectively than a good democracy . 
  yes , being a supporter of dictatorship , racism etc. 
  makes you a prick . 
  it didn \u00b4 t start in 1968 . 
  this was a gradual development that had its beginnings in the early 60s , 1968 was the climax for sure . 
  i would not say that there is guilt in the older baby-boomer generation . 
  guilty was the war-generation . 
  turkish people can vote him out . 
  in the same way that russian people can vote putin out . 
  okay , maybe not as extreme as in russia , but erdogan has shown that he spits on democracy . 
  the referendum that extended his power was manipulated . 
  maybe this should be heavily regulated by the mods . 
  my idea would be that it should be forbidden to start such a `` x of europe '' series post for normal users . 
  instead , the mods them self could start one of such `` x of europe '' series posts every week ( maybe on the weekend ? ) . 
  the topic maybe could be decided by user votes .
