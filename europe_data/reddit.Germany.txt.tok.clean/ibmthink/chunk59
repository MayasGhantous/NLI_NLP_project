  this way we still would have these posts but not have them flood the subreddit every day . 
  originally i found these series posts very interesting , but in the last few days , it really turned into absurd karma-whoring , with a new `` x of europe '' trend every few hours . 
  thats a very interesting point . 
  germans are often accused to have `` guilt '' because of the war and the holocaust . 
  i would say however that this isn \u00b4 t really the case with younger people . 
  most everyone acknowledges and condemns the nazi crimes , but not many would say that they are guilty of anything . 
  the time of the `` guilt '' really were the late 60s and 70s , when the first generation that was born after the war was grown up and looked more closely on the past and their parents actions . 
  before , it was very similar to how you describe it as it was in poland , people didn \u00b4 t want to talk about the war and past crimes in the 50s . 
  maybe poland is experiencing a similar effect as germany in the 60s , only in the opposite , conservative direction . 
  as now the first generation after the fall of the iron curtain is grown up . 
  we don \u00b4 t have jokes . 
  thats the joke . 
  in every joke , there is a core of truth . 
  to me , it often seems like poland has a severe victim complex . 
  which is no wonder considering its history , but it is still very problematic . 
  polan can not into space , but into dictatorship-light they certainly can . 
  the situation still isn \u00b4 t as bad as hungary , but not very far from it . 
  well , the native americans shouldn \u00b4 t really be counted . 
  they were very sensitive to all `` old world diseases '' . 
  these diseases , be it measles , smallpox or the normal flu , killed more native americans than the actions by european colonial military . 
  wait , are you slovenian or czech ? 
  i always mix those up ... 
  lol , yes . 
  the world would be much easier if they existed . 
  rich people who actually feel responsibility for society ... what a dream . 
  i think that it is hard , because he really is completely retarded . 
  typical trumptard . 
   berlin is nobody 's first choice . 
  generalization much ? 
  like ... there are billions of people living on this planet . 
  you think they all would prefer london over berlin ? 
  i would say no . 
  berlin has its own charm . 
   shitty right wing government backs shitty right wing government big surprise there . 
  yes , germany did cause ww1 . 
  but we didn \u00b4 t cause it alone , this is the important distinction . 
  saying that germany didn \u00b4 t cause it is also wrong . 
  the blankoscheck that we gave austria-hungary should never be forgotten . 
  oh yes . 
  it was germany alone who caused the refugee crisis !, 
  shame on germany for taking a short break from ignoring the problems of southern europe and trying to help our european neighbors . 
  / s get a reality check . 
  and maybe think about why these people are refugees in the first place . 
  its not surprising that trumptards like a trump speech that is meant to divide europe . 
  which country ? 
  never heard of it . 
  there are no countries between germany and russia / s, 
   do you have problems with critical thinking ? 
  ripuarian , moselle franconian and rhine franconian are all variants of high german , it is not because they mention franconian that they are in any way related to old-franconian . 
  here is the family tree of the west germanic languages : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_germanic_languages as you can see , high german and low franconian are a completely seperate branch . 
  what kind of utter nonsense is this ? 
  again , r/badlinguistics . 
  it seems that you , not me , should go to r/badlinguistics . 
  they are variants of high german ? 
  honestly , how ignorant are you ? 
  for the longest time in history , there was no standard german . 
  high german was developed in the 19th century to give german people a common language to communicate with . 
  because in the 18th century , someone from close to the dutch border would have a very hard time talking with someone from south bavaria . 
  they spoke languages that had to be considered separate . 
  and these german languages are the dialects . 
  someone from the german-dutch border who speaks the local dialect will have an easy time talking with someone who speaks dutch , because they are very similar . 
  meanwhile , you try to construct a picture that these german dialects are based on high german ... no , sorry . 
  you are wrong . 
  they are based on the ancient frankish germanic language , just like dutch is . 
  just different branches : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franconian_languages and yes , high german and dutch are different languages , though still closely related . 
  what does that have to do with the local dialects ? 
  nothing at all !, 
   you are full of shit . 
  speak for yourself . 
  and while you are at it , go to / r/badhistory / where you belong . 
   it is commonly accepted that karel martel and karel de grote are what we call `` ancient '' belgians sigh ... nope . 
  it isn \u00b4 t. 
   lived in our lands bull-shit : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/frankish_empire_481_to_814-en.svg/1591px-frankish_empire_481_to_814-en.svg.png even if you take austrasia as the core of the frankish empire , that region would be very evenly split between germany , belgium , the netherlands and france today . 
  i really shouldn \u00b4 t waste my time on a petty nationalist like you , but , oh well ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ripuarian_language https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moselle_franconian_dialects https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhine_franconian_dialects all of these dialects developed from the frankish germanic dialect that karl martell likely spoke as well . 
   stop trying to appropriate/deny someone else 's history , it seems like you either want him to be german or nothing at all . 
  where did i ever say he was german ? 
  he wasn \u00b4 t because that state didn \u00b4 t exist !, 
  you are the one who wants to claim a historical figure born in a big multiethnic , multiclanguage empire as your own , not me . 
  its just stupid , and wrong . 
  you must have really low self esteem if you have to claim people like karl martell or karl den gro\u00dfen as your own to be happy . 
  no one can claim them . 
  their legacy belongs to france , germany and benelux to the same extend . 
  it was merkels decision to have the g20 summit in hamburg . 
  a very bad decision indeed . 
  you are just sticking your fingers in your ears and ignoring what i said . 
  actually , we don \u00b4 t know how karl martell spoke , because there are little to no records of this time about language differences . 
  the language the franks spoke influenced german as well as dutch dialects . 
  after all , dutch is just a variety of german . 
  dutch comes from low-frankish , here in southern hesse , the dialects are from the rhine-frankish type , in parts of nrw they are south-low-frankish etc. 
  you can \u00b4 t claim karl martell . 
  neither can france or germany . 
  those nations didn \u00b4 t exist . 
  you could also try to claim that julius caesar was italian because latin is close to the italian language . 
  but that is just as wrong . 
  backwards projecting history doesn \u00b4 t work , sorry . 
  he was a frank . 
  the franks were a germanic tribe who conquered gaul and belgica ( which was considered a part of gaul ) from the failing western roman empire . 
  by all means he could be considered german if you argue like that . 
  except its bullshit . 
  because national identities didn \u00b4 t form until much , much later .
