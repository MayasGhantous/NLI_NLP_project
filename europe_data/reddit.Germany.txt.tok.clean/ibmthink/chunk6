  rename the city to constantinople , internationalize it ( as well as some area around it ) , then we have a deal . 
  let me guess erdogans next step : demanding a permanent seat in the un security council . 
  not really everyone nearby . 
  only austria and poland , our bestest friends ever . 
  luckily , our western neighbors are too busy laughing at belgium . 
  why bosnia jokes about germany , i am not sure . 
  i never said that this was my opinion . 
  there may be a campaign , but that one is coming out of russia , not germany . 
  its pure propaganda of course . 
  most joked about countries : - bosnia-herzegovina : 5 - greece : 3 - sweden : 3 - germany : 3 ( why , bosnia , why ?! ), 
  - belgium : 3 - estonia : 2 countries no one jokes about ( or cares for ) : switzerland , iceland , latvia , lithuania , croatia , serbia , montenegro , slovenia , kosovo , turkey , bulgaria , moldavia , netherlands, 
  sorry , the vermin quote was wrong , he did say however that they bring illness : http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/10/14/right-wing-polish-leader-migrants-carry-diseases-to-europe he didn \u00b4 t call them vermin , but he said that they carry vermin apparently : http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/11/syria_s_refugee_crisis_is_a_european_emergency_far_right_parties_are_rising.html  in poland , where there are very few refugees the nationalist right has nevertheless just won an election during which the leader of the new ruling party warned against refugees carrying `` vermin '' and `` diseases . '', 
  a single person that is party leader and effectively controls it ? 
  yeah . 
  you are simply putting your fingers into your ears and say `` lalalala '' . 
  complete denial . 
  the guardian called out the pis government for what they are . 
  deny reality all you want . 
   so refusing to take in tens of thousands of unidentified people means being xenophobic to you ? 
  no , but saying that `` refugees bring illness '' without any scientific basis is . 
  yes , there are people who watch russia today . 
  its very popular on the right wing as well . 
  its a minority , but a loud one . 
  to explain it : in the eyes of these peoples ( called `` putin versteher '' here in germany ) , russia has the right to intervene , because the west constantly tries to hurt russia by letting countries like georgia/ukraine join the nato/eu . 
  so it makes sense for them . 
  the us on the other hand is seen as the aggressor by these people , constantly intervening everywhere . 
  and also trying to `` take away '' the neighboring countries of russia to join the western , us dominated block . 
  i am not saying that this is my opinion , mind you . 
  its just what these people think . 
  a lot of them also distrust western media and rather watch russia today . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk_ahtg5cxe ), 
  russia was invited by the syrian government . 
  but not in the same way as the us . 
  they intervened in countries directly around them ( georgia , ukraine ) , but not all around the world like the usa . 
  it depends who you talk to on the left . 
  people on the liberal side of the left ( greens ) don \u00b4 t like putin , people on the more authoritarian side of the left ( parts of die linke ) like putin and russia . 
  russia is seen as an alternative to the usa , which are hated on the left , as the us stand for capitalism and also , intervention wars . 
  most people on the left reject military interventions . 
  fringe parties in the west , but very important parties in east germany . 
  the bankers often live in taunus . 
  lol , i love this map . 
  creates so much anger , its hilarious . 
  most hilarious is maybe attila the hun . 
  and kant for russia . 
  i would argue that technically , back then it was still the eastern roman empire . 
  the official language was still latin until the 7th century . 
  so no iberia , northern italy , africa , syria , palestine , egypt and libya for you . 
  :-p try [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/map_byzantine_empire_1025-en.svg/1280px-map_byzantine_empire_1025-en.svg.png ) instead , seems more realistic . 
  aren \u00b4 t blue jeans an american invention ? 
  no matter what russia does , its always embarrassing . 
  i agree . 
  the vanilla version was pretty bad , but with brave new world and gods and kings , it was good enough ( not as much content as civ 4 with all expansions , but ok ) . 
  the nice thing about civ 6 is that they didn \u00b4 t cut down all the content this time . 
  its not as much as civ 5 with all expansions , but much better then civ 5 vanilla . 
  and that poster was downvoted to hell for it . 
  of course , nationalism indeed has very negative connotations attached ( especially here in germany ) , but the word describes parts of the the music pretty well . 
  i don \u00b4 t see why someone needs to be upset because of something like christophers description there , but so is the internet , weird people everywhere . 
  i thought this might be something that is appreciated here , something different from all the bad news and the heated discussions . 
  tomorrow marks the launch of the newest edition of civilization , one of my personal favorite video games . 
  its the 6th rendition of the turn-based strategy game . 
  the main theme of the game was created by u/christophertin / , who also wrote the main theme for civilization iv . 
  the theme for cilivzation iv , [ baba yetu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijihdmyhe1a ) , was in swahili and focused on the cradle of man , very africa-centric . 
  it was the first musical piece for a video game that was awarded with a grammy . 
  this new theme , [ sogno di volare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqyn2p3e06s ) , which means `` the dream of flight '' , is in italian and euro-centric , as the new game has the overall theme of the age of exploration . 
  its just an incredible piece of music imho and fits very well with europe . 
  could be the anthem of europe even !, 
  ( mods : if this post doesn \u00b4 t comply with some rules , please feel free to remove it . 
  this is not meant as an ad for civ or christopher tin ), 
  if we go to bangladesh and compare their standards with lithuania , i am sure that more than 80 % of lithuanians would be considered rich . 
  whats the point of the comparison ? 
  people in greece are much poorer then before . 
  thats a fact . 
  misleading title . 
  spain has a government , the government just has no majority in parliament , thus no new laws can be passed . 
  but the country definitely has a government . 
  i wonder if the 3rd reich would have happened if hitler grew up with thai food . 
  probably yes . 
  although he might have made the an attack on siam the top priority ( you know , in order to obtain the master race of food ) . 
  sure , sure . 
  i also call for a referendum in eastern anatolia . 
  kurds should have a referendum if they want to form an independent state . 
  should be a no-brainer for someone like erdogan , who values democracy over anything else . 
  that would be mostly a punishment of ourself , not russia . 
  they don \u00b4 t need nordstream , we do . 
  damn you vikings . 
  always plundering and pillaging . 
  so far , the sanctions really have done nothing . 
  the ukraine is still split . 
  in the meantime , russia has taken control in the syrian civil war . 
  the refugee crisis : while i definitely applaud her humanitarian approach here , she really did everything without any plan . 
  this has brought us a lot of problems , and it destabilized the german democracy with the extreme right on the rise , 60 years after the nazi terror ended . 
  meanwhile , the crisis in greece was not solved . 
  merkels policy of austerity failed in making the greek economy healthy again . 
  her promise that the german tax payer money will be paid back will be broken , greece can \u00b4 t sustain the debt . 
  they only postponed it in hopes that the bomb won \u00b4 t explode till after the election . 
  in general , merkels style of politics is defined by reaction , not action . 
  sometimes you have to react , yes , but sometimes you also have to act . 
  where are the big reforms , where is the decisive and bold action ? 
  say what you will about schr\u00f6der , but at least he was willing to act . 
  a nice example is the energiewende : merkel just had prolonged the life of the nuklear power plants , then fukushima happens .
