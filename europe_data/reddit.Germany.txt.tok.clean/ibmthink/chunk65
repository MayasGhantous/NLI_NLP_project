  he made several crucial mistakes , lost three state elections and now is back where he started . 
  although its too easy to blame him , the former spd leader gabriel deserves much of the blame . 
  schulz had no time to prepare because gabriel made a surprise decision to not candidate . 
  why have you removed your post then ? 
  says the guy who literally went off-topic in his first post repeating the alt-right copy-pasta about germany and the borders . 
  some people seem to project them self on others . 
  like talking to a brick-wall ... 
  i guess all the turks hate their own country too : https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/6j06vf/turkey_to_stop_teaching_evolution_in_secondary/?sort=confidence or could it be that they hate their stupid government ? 
  but arguing with your ilk is futile , as i have seen many times over in this subreddit . 
  that \u00b4 s big words coming from a country that elected a man as president who behaves like a child , doesn \u00b4 t know anything and throws a hissy-fit every time someone criticizes him in the slightest way . 
  seriously , i think you wanted to go to / r/the _ donald / . 
  its your safe space where no one will ever criticize president cheeto and where you can hate on people of other races and cultures freely . 
  yeah , sure , `` antifa '' . 
  lol . 
  everyone not far right must be antifa ... 
  i can also point to the uk and the dup , a party who will soon be an indirect part of the government and which also houses creationists . 
  also , i am not your bro . 
  i am not defending it . 
  i am saying all religion is bullshit . 
  meanwhile you and your right-wing friends are trying to single out islam as the only `` bad one '' . 
  well . 
  my posts won \u00b4 t be used to help your cause , sorry for that . 
  happens in every country , but the problem is that it is taken to the extreme in germany and with merkel . 
  she doesn \u00b4 t have any program besides herself really . 
  are parts of the usa also going `` full islam '' , because they reject the theory of evolution ? 
  religious nutters can be found in all religions . 
  its wrong regardless of which religion it is . 
  german politics 101 : replace real political action with petty pandering and show acts . 
  people on the radio talked yesterday about which color merkels blazer had . 
  like , seriously . 
  it this politics or a fashion show ? 
  i see turkey is taking `` going full retard '' seriously . 
  [ just as an example : frankfurter gr\u00fcne so\u00dfe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green_sauce#german_gr.c3.bcne_so.c3.9fe ) its the specialty of frankfurt . 
  just ate gr\u00fcne so\u00dfe today , because today is the `` gr\u00fcne so\u00dfen tag '' ( what a coincidence ! ) . 
  its really great . 
  but there are also other dishes like [ handk\u00e4s mit musik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/handk\u00e4se ) ( though i personally don \u00b4 t eat that ) or [ rippchen mit kraut ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurter_rippchen ) and more . 
  i doubt you will find maultaschen in many restaurants in frankfurt . 
  maultaschen is a trademark of schwaben , frankfurt is the biggest city of hesse . 
  i guess you don \u00b4 t know that kohl invited orban to his home a few years ago ? 
  a lot of people have a very wrong image of kohl ... it seems that some people were very successful in revising history and kohls image . 
  the statistic is distorted because of the airport ( and the big train station ) . 
  frankfurt is often named the `` criminal capital '' of germany , but in reality , there are not much more crimes than in every other city . 
  i think you really got the wrong impression of the city , what you describe is mostly one area ( hauptbahnhof ) . 
  more importantly , she wanted to have a speech by victor orban ... 
  kill it with fire . 
  taking away what makes the flags special makes them boring . 
  many of them look the same ( slovakia and slovenia , denmark and austria ) this reminds me of the soviet flags , where every flag for the member states was a variation of the red banner . 
  but even those flags had more variety in design . 
  good luck with that . 
  i don \u00b4 t think many people in germany want more military spending or more international responsibility . 
  funny , because march was really freaking hot around here . 
  april on the other hand was a disaster , dropped back to february temperatures : http://i.imgur.com/os3ldmc.jpg so , we could stop heating in march and had to start again in april ... annoying . 
  me too , but only during the day . 
  sleeping is no fun when its hot . 
  otherwise , i love 30 \u00b0 c + . 
  gives me the holiday feeling . 
  because its not any historic event . 
  it is the most severe crime ever committed by a country . 
  so we germans decided that its unlawful to deny it . 
  i don \u00b4 t think its very hard to understand . 
  this is such a special crime especially for germans that it has a different position from other war crimes etc. 
  you can talk about it all you want , you can even say that it was a good thing ( though that may also be considered volksverhetzung = inciting hate or violence against a group of people ) , but you can \u00b4 t deny it . 
  briefly , yes . 
  there were a few days where some regions had like 32 \u00b0 c , but that didn \u00b4 t last long so far . 
  what are you asking me exactly ? 
  most native americans were killed because of diseases from europe . 
   anyway `` what crime was worse '' discussion is idiotic by all means . 
  it isn \u00b4 t. 
  you are talking about some cases where colonial powers killed natives ( which are also crimes , of course ) , i was talking about mass-genocide trying to exterminate a complete ethnic-religious group on a huge scale . 
   jailing people who say such stuff is not lowering the possibility of such incident , it is making you a retard at the best . 
  so far germany has had little to no problems with neo-nazis , so i think our history proves you wrong . 
  yes , but they hate the modern germany . 
   makes perfect sense . 
  yes it does . 
  holocaust is an crime with no equal in human history . 
  mass-murder on an industrial scale . 
  that holocaust happened is a fact . 
  germany has a responsibility that something like this never happens again , and most of all not happens again in germany . 
  people are not allowed to whitewash history in this case . 
  of course , i am talking with someone from a country where genocide denial is official state policy , which brings things into perspective . 
  you can praise hitler all you want . 
  its the best way to out yourself as an idiot . 
  you can \u00b4 t however deny the holocaust . 
  and thats a good thing . 
  among other things , yes . 
  yes , those places are completely uninhabitable . 
  he doesn \u00b4 t adore germany . 
  in fact , i think its quite the opposite , he hates the german state and he will go to jail . 
  so he is sent just to the right place . 
  [ appropriate . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gshxfsy.png ) these are the temperatures for tomorrow . 
  source is tagesschau.de . 
   -30 celsius and in mountains your balls will freeze off ... fuck winter don \u00b4 t say that . 
  on the contrary , this presents a great business opportunity !, 
  you can sell special underwear with an inbuilt ball-heating-system !, 
  when i drive with my seat belt on , i am not thinking `` oh , now i am indestructible '' . 
  and i doubt most other sane people are . 
  its not going to get any better with austerity . 
  the nordic countries are actually a good example of social democracy and the welfare state at work . 
  social democracy developed from marxism , so marxism played a key role in their development .
