  how exactly would it be inaccurate ? 
   it is really very simple : fewer muslim immigrants = less risk of terrorist attacks simple but also wrong , because as long as there are still muslims there is still the threat . 
  and there also can be converts . 
  all these arguments about `` we should deport all muslims '' or `` stop immigration completely '' are stupid . 
  and wrong , because forcefully deporting people with citizenship is illegal and also inhuman . 
  the real issue here is radicalization . 
  while its hard to stop it completely , there can be actions against it . 
  there needs to be decisive actions against mosques with radical imams . 
  saudi arabia can no longer be allowed to influence imams in europe . 
  imams need an official license from the state , so they would have to go through official training authorized by the state . 
  no longer allow radicalization in prisons to happen . 
  basically , stop radicalization as much as possible . 
  this will lower the risk much further than banning all muslim immigration . 
  biological differences ( real or just imagined ) that then are used to make a racist argument ( such as the age old racial stereotype that african people have big dicks and want to have sex all the time ) . 
  two party systems and fptp are bad at representing the complex variety of opinions of the people , its well known . 
  this leads to frustration , as certain people end up without representation and really strains on the foundations of the state , because a non-representative government also means it has questionable legitimacy . 
  its really hard to put trump anywhere in there , because it seems he has no ideological core , he is too dumb to even have that . 
  his ideology is that of his advisors , which is why his rule has been so frantic and headless so far . 
   migrants are n't the problem . 
  they never were . 
  the problem is radicalisation and lack of integration . 
  exactly . 
  but this gets lost in the right wing circlejerk about culture and `` natural differences '' between europeans and people from africa and the near east . 
  which really is just racism in disguise ( painfully obvious everytime someone says '' ` we ' are gon na be ` replaced ' '' ), 
  this is a bit weird . 
  i prefer this one : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/political_chart.svg/941px-political_chart.svg.png, 
  upper right would be anarchism . 
  lower right would be libertarian . 
  lol , thats clearly the most important part of the nato / russia border . 
  they still had significant colonies in africa that mostly became independent during the 60s . 
  these may not have been as significant in terms of industries , but for resources they sure were . 
  don \u00b4 t be too sure . 
  the us only do something if it profits them as well . 
  maybe poland should simply become the 51st state . 
  safer that way . 
  i would say the usa did definitely deliberately damage the british reputation in the suez-crisis , which accelerated decolonization . 
   none of those 3 countries did much of anything for us . 
  well : - belgium was a neutral country , so invading it represented a serious violation against the ruling international order , in which britain also was arguably the biggest superpower . 
  also , it was a convenient reason to declare war on germany and help france , britains ally . 
  - latvia : containment of the soviets . 
  evil communism . 
  - poland : poland was a very important state for the post-ww1 international order in europe , because it represented a buffer between soviet russia and germany that was there to keep both countries at bay . 
  so it was a guaranteed state by britain and france . 
  after what happened with czechoslowakia , there was no more alternative to war at this point too . 
   i 'm not overly surprised by out score . 
  me neither . 
  just like here in germany , i think business is very important for the british . 
  and war is generally bad for business , except maybe the arms industry . 
  this . 
  a lot of people come here for this kind of seasonal work and go back home after a few weeks/months . 
  west-germany would have been very likely destroyed by multiple nuclear blasts in the case of a soviet invasion . 
  our army was meant to be the cannon-fodder on the front line to hold off the russians long enough for the nuclear strike . 
  `` protection '' . 
  more like constant fear of death . 
  eastern germany is hardly representative for the whole country . 
  they also have a lot more problems with right wing extremism there . 
  true wiener schnitzel is calf though . 
  i hope though that its not fish from the baltic sea , as i have heard that it can be pretty dirty . 
  especially near the kaliningrad area . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v09knqiyi-c just because . 
  inspiration from the simpsons . 
  i don \u00b4 t get why this is downvoted . 
  its a pretty well known fact . 
  what isis is dreaming off is a war of the whole arabic/islamic world against all of the west . 
  but most muslims don \u00b4 t follow them . 
  so getting the western states to go further into open war is a way for them to win support . 
  its nice to see that labour gets back into the game . 
  i remember that when may announced the snap-elections , many brexiteers around here were having serious schadenfreude about the impending implosion of labour . 
  seems like corbyn won \u00b4 t go away . 
  brainwashed is a strong word . 
  influenced would fit better , imho . 
  of course , if most of the media coverage is pro orban , not reporting on his scandals or problems and only reporting in his favor , this influences the opinions of the people . 
  he doesn \u00b4 t control all the media ( yet ) , but many independent media-organizations have been closed down or bought by orban friends in the last years . 
  the state media are of course in his hand , so he has the tools to influence the opinion of large parts of the population . 
  i believe the eu has shown its concern over the situation in hungary , but they can \u00b4 t really act unless all member states agree on sanctions . 
  hard to vote someone out who controls huge parts of the media and has changed the voting system to his advantage . 
  protests make the disagreement with his government visible . 
  just staying silent at home also doesn \u00b4 t help . 
  sure , the weather influences it on a long time basis , but of course hydro is much less influenced by day to day weather . 
  you always have a certain base electricity production with hydro . 
  thats what i meant . 
  yes , but this vote is about constructing new power-plants . 
  so while the the current plants will keep running for the foreseeable future ( in accordance with the other vote ) , there will be no new plants . 
  which means once the old plants reach their end-of-life point , no more nuclear power in switzerland . 
  hydro is just the natural choice , seeing how mountainous the country is . 
  hydro of course is also more reliable than solar and wind , as the water always flows , no matter how the weather behaves . 
  ** tl ; dr and translation : ** swiss voters decided this sunday that the era of nuclear power is ending in switzerland , as they voted for a slow phase-out of nuclear power . 
  the new energy-law , that will go in effect in 2018 , forbids the construction of new nuclear power plants and raises the subsidies for renewable energies . 
  last fall , the swiss voters rejected a plan of the green party to close down the nuclear power plants until 2029 , so the five existing plants will continue to produce power as long as they are considered safe . 
  while zeman seems like a joke , he doesn \u00b4 t seem like a complete moron , unlike trump . 
   yes i 'm sure the tories the only party in the uk to have two female prime ministers would be against the female vote nice argument genius , but i was talking about how it was when the right to vote for women was first established . 
  of course now it is different than in the early 20th century . 
   women also tend to lean conservative in elections too oh really ? 
  i guess thats why the alt-right loosers want to take away womens voting rights . 
  you can also turn it around : conservative parties are scared of democracy . 
  if it was up to them we would still probably have a voting age of 25 , no voting rights for women and also voting based on wealth . 
  because these were all things defended by conservative parties as well . 
  ** td ; dr and translation : ** mario draghis tenure as the head of the ecb will end in 2019 . 
  according to the magazine * der spiegel * leading members of the german government , notably chancellor merkel and minister of finances sch\u00e4uble , want to lobby for jens weidmann , current head of the bundesbank , to become the next head of the ecb . 
  sch\u00e4uble is a notable critic of draghis current monetary policies and the hope is that a german head of the ecb would value the stability of the currency more .
