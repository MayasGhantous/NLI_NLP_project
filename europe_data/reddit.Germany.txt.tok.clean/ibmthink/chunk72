  if germany wouldn \u00b4 t have let some refugees in , this could have meant serious chaos in these countries . 
   you just turn on the tv and the leftist news , government criticism , etc. 
  is overwhelming you . 
  i would say the pro-government news in hungary is overwhelming you , my friend . 
   i do n't feel that the voting system is favoring anyone . 
  why should it . 
  because it was designed by orban to favor his party , thats why . 
  change the voting system to fptp in parts , favors the biggest party ( fidesz ) . 
  canceling the second round that balanced it out more . 
  creating a new division in electoral areas which favors your party ( gerrymandering ) . 
  lowering the number of members of parliament to make it less representative . 
  in the end it gives orban the edge and ensures his victory . 
   the number of parliamentarian have been reduced , which is part of the bureaucracy reduction program . 
  of course , genius !, 
  you really are a pro at making excuses for orban and eating up the government propaganda . 
   you do n't live in hungary , you do n't know what you 're talking about i have relatives in hungary and they are pro-orban . 
   the low quality of commercial television was one of the reasons why the ad-tax was increased . 
  yeah , right , a fine excuse . 
  thats why it was lowered again after the negotiations , right ? 
  magical improvement in quality ? 
   so you imply that the hungarian government has influence on the german pro7 & sat1 ? 
  same with telekom ? 
  pro7sat1 sold to two managers of the station and they then sold it to an orban friend . 
  telekom apparently got some government contracts for building broadband network after the website was sold . 
  belongs to the austrian businessman heinrich pecina belonged . 
  it was sold to opimus mid october 2016 . 
  it now belongs to l\u0151rinc m\u00e9sz\u00e1ros . 
  an orban friend . 
   `` the closure of n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g was not a market decision . 
  because there is no market here . '', 
  - noone was interested in it . 
  yeah , right . 
  no one was interested in one of the biggest papers . 
  the acquisition of mediaworks by opimus - pure coincidence . 
  no connection at all . 
  yeah , because there is no difference between taking in some refugees from a war-torn country in an extreme situation vs. letting in economic migrants from poland on a permanent basis . 
  - december 2013 : independent tv station tv2 gets sold by prosiebensat .1 media to two tv2 managers . 
  since 2015 , the station is owned andrew g. vajna , a friend of orban . 
  the station is now pro-government . 
  - 2014 : the hungarian government introduces advertisement-tax that is aimed against the critical tv station rtl klub . 
  in spring 2015 , the tax gets lowered after the rtl group negotiated with the government . 
  since then , the tv-station is less critical of the government then before . 
  - december 2015 : the telekom sells the website origo , a website which before uncovered corruption scandals around orban . 
  after this origo is now completely in line with the government . 
  - october 2016 : the big left-leaning paper `` n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g '' get shut down . 
  two weeks after the paper is discontinued , the parent company mediaworks was bought by the opimus group ag , a company controlled by the hungarian oligarch l\u0151rinc m\u00e9sz\u00e1ros , who is a friend of victor orb\u00e1n . 
  mediaworks not only controlled n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g , but also 12 local papers in hungary . 
  independent media in hungary are put under pressure to be less critical , or else they loose advertisement deals , there are special taxes or they just get bought by some obscure company owned by an orb\u00e1n friend . 
   and this is also a fact . 
  what is also a fact is that the voting system is favoring fidesz . 
  you can not deny that and its not democratic , no matter what you say . 
  opposition is weak in hungary because its very split-up and the media are largely controlled by orb\u00e1n . 
  very similar situation to turkey actually . 
   this is democracy , not a dictatorship , as someone might hint . 
  yes , but changing the voting system so your party profits and is nearly guaranteed to win every election is not democracy . 
  shutting down independent media or bringing them under government control is not democracy . 
  thats more like `` dictatorship light '' where there are still elections , but their outcome is predetermined . 
   the thing is that the state should not collect excessive taxes . 
  these are coming from the people and should provide for the people . 
  exessive taxes can only be collected in good times and used to invest and cut debt . 
  in bad times , taxes go down . 
  by this logic , every time the state collects exessive taxes there should be a cut , leaving the state with more debts in a crisis . 
  but taxes are not meant to be a zero-sum game . 
  they can be used to prepare for a not-so-rosy-future which lies ahead for germany . 
  that there shouldn \u00b4 t be excessive taxes is in general an ideological decision more so than `` realpolitik '' . 
  the effectiveness of tax cuts for the economy has been shown to be very small . 
  trickle-down economics don \u00b4 t work . 
   also for the towns and local muncipalities that is local issues not a a general issue and one that does not have much of anything to do with federal policy becaue it concerns the towns . 
  you just said that taxes should provide for the people - doesn \u00b4 t that also include the towns and municipalities ? 
  they are responsible for a lot of stuff , and when they can \u00b4 t invest , many things fall apart or get shut down . 
  its not all just about the stuff the federal government owns . 
  thats just one part of the state . 
  just one example : towns in debts sometimes have to shut down local bus-lines . 
  this means if you don \u00b4 t have a car you can \u00b4 t go anywhere , which leaves the town a much less attractive place to live in . 
  meaning people are more likely to move to bigger cities . 
  this leaves the smaller towns with only old people and the big cities with even higher rents . 
  one problems creates another and results in a vicious cycle . 
   that surplus money in my oppinion shoukd go into debt and ** tax reductions ** yeah , no . 
  that would be the worst thing you could do with the money , because it would cripple the future ability of the state to invest ( which of course is the goal of some people for ideological reasons ) . 
  taxes once lowered are very hard to raise again , because apparently raising taxes is unpopular , who knew . 
  the economical effects of tax-cuts are very doubtful , unless you agree with donald trump . 
  you also gave a pretty good argument against tax cuts when you argued against investments :  and what happens when interest rates rise again and you have to re finance these loans ? 
  juust have the next government worry aboit that ? 
  and what to do when the economy goes down again ( which will happen ) ? 
  take in even more debt because the state doesn \u00b4 t collect enough taxes ? 
   as for the roads we have seen a large infrastructure package created only recently . 
  there is also a ton of building going on already at least where i live ( lower franconia ) . 
  its not just the roads , its also the towns and local municipalities who drown in debt , having a huge need for money to invest . 
  so it would be a great idea to create a big fund for towns/municipalities in need . 
  does he though ? 
  the parliamentary election are still upcoming , so it is possible he wins a majority . 
  ** tl ; dr and translation : ** when hungarys prime minister victor orb\u00e1n proclaimed in february that hungary would take in the `` true victims of western liberalism '' , he might have created a bigger problem for his country . 
  the wanted german holocaust-denier and right-wing extremist horst mahler , former raf terrorist , was arrested this monday in the hungarian border-city sopron . 
  before that happened , he allegedly requested asylum in hungary . 
  the problem goes beyond mahler , as hungary has recently become a safe-haven for right-wing extremists . 
  western european and us extremists are often holding meetings in hungary and they also use the country sometimes as a place to escape persecution . 
  for example , the wanted german extremist mario r\u00f6nsch , who is wanted for illegal trade of weapons , seems to be living in hungary , a picture shows him in the hungarian parliament as a guest of the right-wing party jobbik . 
  the hungarian government agencies say they don \u00b4 t know if he is in the country or not . 
  many other known far-right extremists live in hungary , for example the swedish daniel friberg and tor westman or the british jim dowson and nick griffin ( former head of the bnp ) . 
  griffin was interviewed by the website 444 . hu on a conference with the topic `` stop operation soros '' , where he said : `` hungary already is a good center , there exists a community of emigrated nationalists '' .
