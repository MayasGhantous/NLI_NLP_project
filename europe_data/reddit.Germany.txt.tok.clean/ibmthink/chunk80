  what the us government has suggested is a pre-emptive strike , probably with nuclear weapons . 
  in which case the north koreans would instantly strike out against south korea or japan with their nukes . 
  hungary was a german ally in the war . 
  so , the possible death of millions counts as ` no problem ' ? 
  okay ... 
  i don \u00b4 t think there will be direct consequences ( meaning destruction in europe ) , but there surely will be indirect ones , disruption in trade and such . 
  one has to consider : an attack on the north would likely also doom the south , as the north is ready to unleash nuclear weapons on south korea in the case of war . 
  so the economy of the world would take a pretty big hit instantly . 
  i was thinking the usa would be smart enough to stay away from attacking north korea ... but trump might be actually dumb enough to do it . 
  i guess never underestimated utter stupidity . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/germanymustperish2.jpg this is the original kaufmann plan , austria does not exist there . 
  you will like this one even more : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/germanymustperish2.jpg you even get half of schlesien in this one ... 
  original kaufmann-plan ( which this map is based on ) included the destruction of austria as well : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/germanymustperish2.jpg,

  these plans would have happened i think , if the allies didn \u00b4 t need germany as a protective shield against communism and as a market . 
  compromise : no one gets it . 
  free city of hamburg . 
  be glad you didn \u00b4 t get partitioned in this map / s, 
  repost , saw this one a few months ago . 
  what do you mean ? 
  its pretty clear whats happening , the voters on the left , which were split between hamon and melenchon before , have chosen the later now as their candidate . 
  it was clear from the beginning that a left candidate would have the potential to get into the second round , if the left would unite . 
  macron vs. melenchon would be great . 
  the most important thing after all is that le pen does not win . 
  he is not a member of the socialist party ( ps ) , their candidate would be the poor hamon ... he is essentially what the party die linke is in germany , left of the socialists/social democrats but right of the communists . 
  ever heard of the middle ages ? 
  the middle-east and north africa was rich then as well ... maybe its not islam that has made these countries poor ? 
  this looks like a map from the game risk ... 
  no , sweden and norway joined finland . 
  prepare to be assimilated . 
  resistance is futile !, 
  it only has a connection with socialism in the broadest sense that it was an extreme conservative reaction to it . 
  though fascism also was a reaction to liberalism as well , so its more like a reaction to progressive ideologies as a whole . 
   i do n't really give a fuck what hitler and the nazi 's aims were , or whether they really stuck to the third way , or even what his parties relationship to socialism was . 
  then don \u00b4 t try to use this as an argument in a discussion , if you don \u00b4 t `` give a fuck '' . 
  you were the one who brought this up and said `` adolf hitler ran on a `` third way '' , something that definitely was n't capitalist '' , which is of course suggesting some kind of deeper connection with socialism . 
  oh , this old thing again . 
  nazis were left , socialist because of their party name etc. 
  just no . 
  fascism is the arch-enemy of marxism , because both ideologies in their core have a completely different view of the world . 
  communism and the soviet union were hitlers main enemies . 
  in marxism , the future is literally supposed to be an utopia , which inherently makes it an ideology with a very positive , progressive outlook -  things will be better in the future . 
  but necessary for that is either revolution or reform , change . 
  fascism on the other hand is an extreme form of conservatism . 
  its core is : things were better in the past , so lets go back to it . 
  thats why the nazis always glorified the german past and fantasy tales like the nibelung . 
   adolf hitler ran on a `` third way '' , something that definitely was n't capitalist he only tried to appease the workers so they stupidly vote for his party . 
  what hitler did was definitely not connected with socialism in any way . 
  hitler did not try to change the ownership of the means of production . 
  on the contrary , he worked very close with the wealthy of germany , who were big supporters of him . 
  hitlers rule ( or rather ascend to power ) was based on two simple things : he would not change the means of production , unlike the communists , which means his rule was acceptable for all wealthy people , and he was offering the people redemption for the lost war ( which turned out to be another war , which was an even greater disaster ) . 
  who ? 
  the last war ended in a loss of territory for germany . 
  most germans don \u00b4 t actually know friedrich ii . 
  there are not many `` great conquerors '' in recent german history . 
  maybe at most you could say bismark , who united germany after all . 
  bust conquerors have kind of a bad name here in germany after our last attempt at world domination . 
  i don \u00b4 t drink . 
  i accidentially had a sip of beer with coke once ( thought it was coke ) , tasted horribly . 
  and it wasn \u00b4 t the coke that tasted horribly . 
  you are now banned from / r/italy,

  cheaper maybe . 
  pastic , we buy the glass bottles anyway . 
  easier to use , eh , i prefer to always have a bottle ready . 
  having to refill and `` sparkle it up '' is annoying imho . 
  occasionally . 
  not that the quality is bad , its very good around here . 
  but i just prefer sparkling water . 
  so , its buying bottled water for me . 
  none , i don \u00b4 t eat cheese . 
  everything outside of bavaria , k\u00f6ln , hamburg , berlin and maybe parts of baden-w\u00fcrttemberg, 
  even though my grandpa is hungarian , hungarian is like an alien language . 
  uhm ... no ? 
  its a book that is written terribly and it echoes a toxic , sick ideology . 
  would be completely out of place for high-schoolers . 
  yes of course , thats why i wrote , this won \u00b4 t happen . 
  i don \u00b4 t want to offend you or anyone else . 
  its just my point of view , i am not a huge fan of nationalism and i think people are better off if they work together instead of fighting with each other . 
  i understand that there are historic implications and problems . 
  if i would follow your line of thought , i could also argue that germany should be broken in small pieces . 
  because the dialects are ( or were ) so different that it was/is hard to understand people from other parts of germany sometimes ( with the standard language , this is changing of course ) . 
  point being : things change . 
  countries come and go . 
  nationalism is still a fairly new ideology if we look at human history . 
  in general yes , but because of the historic implications , no . 
  its also outlawed in austria , so i don \u00b4 t think its really worth considering this . 
  both countries are in the eu now anyway , austria is a close and valued partner . 
  trump sees the eu and germany as his enemies , so he is our enemy as well . 
  as long as he is in power , the us can no longer be our trusted partner . 
  i think the world economy may tank very soon if the continues like this . 
  i thought you weren \u00b4 t allowed here ? 
  :-) actually , the languages are very close as far as i understand it , and until 1944 , the dialects in todays macedonia were considered as bulgarian . 
  of course nationalism changes things and a separate macedonian language was standardized . 
  but i would agree with the position of bulgaria and greece that macedonian is a bulgarian dialect and that macedonia should be/could be part of bulgaria . 
  of course , this likely won \u00b4 t happen , because of muh nationalism . 
  also , the elites of your country don \u00b4 t want to give up power , which is understandable . 
  simple solution : the country shouldn \u00b4 t exist , i think it should be part of bulgaria . 
  would fit well enough on maps too . 
  but if it has to exist , why not rename it to avoid the conflict , could be named vadar or vadaria ( after the river [ vardar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vardar ) ) .
