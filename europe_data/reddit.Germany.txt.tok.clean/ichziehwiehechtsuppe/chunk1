you mean sent `` back '' ? 
  about half of all asylum appliciations get rejected . 
  the applicants then are sent back . 
  good joke . 
  in 2014 there were 154 191 asylum applicants that had to leave germany in theory ( `` ausreisepflichtige asylbewerber '' ) . 
  113 221 of those have a so called `` tolerated '' - status ( `` duldung '' ) , which means they do n't actually have to leave for various reasons ( lack of identification - 80 % of applicants say they have no id , their countries of origin refuse cooperation , humanitarian reasons , ... ) 2 . 
  40 970 were without the `` tolerated '' - status ( `` unmittelbar ausreisepflichtige asylbewerber '' ) 21 764 denied asylum applicants left germany ( voluntary + deported ) that year . 
  in total 10 884 foreigners , not all of them asylum applicants , were deported from germany . 
  that 's laughable , especially when you consider that there were 202 834 asylum applications . 
  even if both of these , asian silicon valley programmers and arab ` refugees ' , were unselected migrant populations representative of their respective countries of origin the differences in education would be startling . 
  timss ( 2007 ) studied the math and science ability of pupils in many countries including south korea , taiwan , egypt and syria ( home countries of these very different kinds of migrants ) . 
  there are 4 benchmark points that can be reached . 
  the following table shows how many of the tested 8 graders reached the respective benchmark levels in the math section . 
  + ------------- + ---------- + ------ + -------------- + ----- + | country | advanced | high | intermediate | low | + ------------- + ---------- + ------ + -------------- + ----- + | taiwan | 45 % | 71 % | 86 % | 95 % | | south korea | 40 % | 71 % | 90 % | 98 % | | syria | 0 % | 3 % | 17 % | 47 % | | egypt | 1 % | 5 % | 21 % | 47 % | + ------------- + ---------- + ------ + -------------- + ----- + source : chapter 2 of timss 2007 international mathematics report : findings from iea 's trends in international mathematics and science study at the fourth and eighth grades http://timss.bc.edu/timss2007/pdf/t07_m_ir_chapter2.pdf, 
  the ` refugees ' threw stones and broke the gate . 
  the police used tear-gas and water canons to protect themselves and the border . 
  what were they supposed to do ? 
  we do n't . 
  we just have border controls . 
  not a single asylum seeker has been send back to austria at the border , which would be perfectly legal according to the dublin agreement . 
  if you leave a safe refugee camp in turkey to travel through multiple safe countries without asking for asylum in any of them . 
  can you still claim to be a refugee ? 
  i think not . 
   there are also big differences in pisa test results , reflecting a gap already among pupils very true . 
  anatoly karlin has a decent blog post that shows how large the difference actually is in many european countries . 
  quote :  so do scores in many european states when only natives are considered ( e.g. 
  germany from 510 to 533 ; switzerland from 517 to 542 ; the netherlands from 519 to 533 ) . 
  in fact , the countries mentioned above and a few others equalize with japan 's 529 , taiwan 's 534 , and south korea 's 541 ( the natives of these developed east asian societies also score a lot higher than their immigrants , but the overall effect on the national average is modest because migrant children are such a small percentage of their school-age populations ) . 
  http://akarlin.com/2012/05/berlin-gets-bad-news-from-pisa/ it baffles me that some people really believe that it is a good idea to let in more immigrants without a careful selection process . 
  australia shows how immigration can be an economic benefit to your country . 
  yep . 
  i 'm very thankful towards hungary . 
  the whole asylum system has to be revamped . 
  people should be able to apply for asylum from outside of europe . 
  if you 're a legitimate political dissident or a member of an ethnic or religious group that is close to getting killed off in their home country . 
  fine , you may come . 
  if you enter europe illegally : you should be deported in almost every case . 
  inb4walls/bordercan ` tkeeppeopleout you might want to look into australia , israel , saudi arabia , japan , qatar , ... and hungary . 
  switzerland takes 48 hours to decide a asylum application . 
  of course realizing this plan would take a lot of effort , but the current ` system ' has proven to be a total disaster for everybody involved and also takes a lot of resources . 
   locked in nobody is locked in . 
  they can leave anytime they want ( in one direction at least ), 
  i want them to enter a transit-zone at the european border , let them apply for asylum there while allowing them to live there , in humane conditions , until it is processed . 
  then they either may enter europe or they 'll be send back . 
  is my position that hard to comprehend ? 
   israel 's policy is absolutely working fine if you discount the conflict of the last 60 years . 
  which has been caused by israel not letting in illegal immigrants ? 
  that makes things much , much easier . 
  the length of european land borders that need to be fenced/secured is quite small actually . 
  using the european navies to protect the sea borders is more important . 
  australia shows that this can be done . 
   air travel . 
  you do n't touch down in other countries , many refugees register themselves at airports . 
  very few actually - in the range of hundreds in germany . 
  germany has an established procedure for this aptly named ` flughafenverfahren ' and it works decently ( it involves a transit zone , quick decision making and not letting denied applicants enter the country - basically what i want for the european borders ) . 
   in practice , it 's hard if not impossible to send people back . 
  some people arrive undocumented - there 's places in africa still where people grow up without even having a birth certificate . 
  others burn their passports . 
  i 'm [ personally arguing ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3se3mx/german_government_reinstates_dublin_rule/cwwhwoz ) for not letting them in as long as they have n't been accepted as refugees to avoid these well known problems . 
   i 'm actually astounded by the fact that you 're linking immigration and ` national iq research ' . 
  i have no words . 
  i 'm astounded that you 're astounded . 
  many articles on the topic of national differences in cognitive ability have been published in reputable psychology periodicals - the one i linked was published in an [ aps journal ] ( https://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/journals/perspectives ) and contains references to many others . 
  pretending this is n't a serious issue does n't make it go away . 
  have [ another one ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/scimag/?s=10.1017%2fs0021932014000480 ) which deals with migration ______ edit : the topic of national iq has been getting a lot of research attention in the past decade . 
  a [ popsci book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/hive-mind-your-nation%c2%92s-matters/dp/0804785961 ) on the topic has been published yesterday actully . 
  in a few years even you will stop being astounded that this is issue is brought up ...  `` for over 100 years , we 've neglected the importance of national differences in our cognitive progress ; this book is a welcome antidote and an eye opener . 
  '' -- james r. flynn , university of otago, 
  the european solution would be : * protect european borders ( fences at the southern/eastern borders + navy in the mediterranean sea ) * transit zones ( hot spots ) at the border , only in these you can apply for asylum * unified and strict asylum rules but the german gov decided on repeating empirically false talking points ( `` securing the border does n't work in the 21 ^ st century '' ) , wishful thinking ( `` qualified workers for germany '' ) and moral posturing instead , thereby weakening the eu and the german leadership position within europe . 
  a germany with a national trauma that keeps it from finding practical solutions is n't fit for the modern era . 
  [ data from the gss ] ( http://anepigone.blogspot.com/2011/03/republicans-are-more-scientifically.html ) shows that republicans actually have a better scientific literacy than democrats . 
  democrats tend to be more hispanic/black ( who tend to be less educated than whites - or asians ) than republicans which skews the data . 
  razib khan analyzed the dataset excluding non-whites and came to the conclusion that the [ scientific literacy of conservatives and liberals is roughly equal ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2011/03/the-republican-fluency-with-science/ ) . 
  there are issues in both political camps where ideology overshadows scientific evidence . 
  for conservatives this includes global warming , evolution and the age of the earth . 
  for liberals it 's the importance of heredity , intelligence research ( iq/g ) and the supposed dangers of gmo food . 
  this `` my political camp is smarter/more educated/more evidence based/more sexy/cooler than your political camp '' - shit is real fucking annoying . 
  i think you need to learn more about the g-factor ( positive manifold , indifference of indicators , ... ) . 
   really , in modern psychology we tend to look at wais scores from the subsections separately please show me any study that shows a superior predictive value of subtest scores over fsiq ( or g ) . 
  i 'm waiting ... 
  here 's a quote from a relatively recent review on the subject of intelligence differences :  although cognitive domains are sometimes considered to be independent , differential psychology has firmly established that they are not : people who perform well in one domain also tend to perform well in the others . 
  this is recognized in the term ` general intelligence ' , which is usually designated ` g ' [ ... ]  it is important to emphasise g : it accounts for a substantial large amount of variance , it is the source of most of the predictive power of cognitive tests and , as discussed below , it is the locus of most of the genetic variance .

   the german constitution . 
  pretty much no one out of the current refugee influx can claim asylum within the limits of the german constitution : 1 . it is limited to people that are politically prosecuted 2 . it does n't apply to people entering from a eu member state [ or third-party safe country ] . 
  https://dejure.org/gesetze/gg/16a.html even if the gg art . 
  16 would be a problem , only art . 
  1 and 20 of the german constitution ca n't be changed . 
  they earn a degree and part of their training is in a special school . 
   are most apprenticeships paid work ? 
  here in germany they earn between 400 $ and 1350 $ depending on which year and field they are in http://www.bibb.de/dokumente/pdf/a21_dav_gesamtuebersicht_ausbildungsverguetungen_2014.pdf, 
   the main point of bias is that only western nations have any relevant number of prices . 
  these countries ( with the very recent addition of north-east-asia ) have dominated scientific progress for the last 600 years ( which includes the 20th century obv . ), 
  and continue doing so . 
  i really do n't see a bias tbh . 
  negged for beeing a dumbass, 
   misrepresentation of my post  bunch of unrelated crap 2.5 / 10 - at least you tried, 
  please make a coherent argument .
