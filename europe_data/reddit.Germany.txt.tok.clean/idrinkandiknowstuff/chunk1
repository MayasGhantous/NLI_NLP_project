depends on who you ask . 
  the german government expects to be spending around 100 bn $ until 2020 when they expect the refugee crisis to end . 
  economy experts predict numbers as high as 400 bn $ depending on how well integration works . 
  keep in mind that this is the american billion not german billion , i.e. 
  9 zeroes not 12 . 
  but yeah it 's a ton of money . 
  they are pretty much everywhere . 
  supermarkets , gas stations , kiosks . 
  vending machines are getting rarer since they added the need for a bank card for age verification . 
  i do n't smoke so i 'm note sure on prices but i think the name brands have reached like 7 $ a pack , no names are like 5,50 to 6 , -, 
  yeah but it 's harder to build those things on hills and mountains / s also every time some one wants to built a new windpark or whatever some eco-hippies get their panties in a twist . 
  but as i said ido n't agree with op just felt the need to point out that ` larger = more room ' does n't always work . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with op but your logic is flawed . 
  bigger does n't automatically mean more room . 
  you have to take population density into account . 
  and germany is rather densely populated . 
  well there 's `` holland in not '' which means shit has hit the fan , although more humourous . 
  then there are `` b\u00f6hmische d\u00f6rfer '' litterally bohemian villages , meaning i do n't know anything about that . 
  and if your cant make head or tails of something it `` kommt dir spanisch vor '' seems spanisch to you . 
  i 'd say that depends . 
  i do n't know anyone who would do so for a flu or something and neither would i. 
  but if i 'm on say a skiing vacation and break my leg on the first day , which effectively cancels said vacation , than i 'm sure as hell getting my vacation days back . 
  i personally find `` regisseur '' ( director ) quite hard . 
  but that might be me . 
  note : also a french word . 
  `` sturm im wasserglas '' we have that same thing, 
  well germans like to bitch , so sure every month when the pay slip comes in we will bitch loudly and passionately how much money the evil government has stolen from us and how incredibly unfair that whole system is . 
  but in general everyone knows that taxes are necessary to keep the country running and are generally fine with them . 
  off course most people think that the rich should taxed more than they are . 
  also most people are n't rich . 
  the classic lassmiranda den sewillja ( let me at her , cause she wants it ) , straight from the simpsons, 
  also the turkish minister of healt and nutrition : ismir \u00dcbel, 
  my favorites : * `` holla die waldfee '' ; oh my god or will you look at that . 
  basically an exlcaamation of astonishment.this might be very regional . 
  keep your feet still paraphrased : stay calm * in the same vain : `` immer sch\u00f6n den ball flach halten '' , which is of course a soccer analogy and als means do n't do anything rash . 
  * and my favourite insult : `` bl\u00f6dmannsgehilfe '' basically means idiot 's henchman , also very regional . 
  hauptmann is the equivalent rank to captain , not sure where you 're getting the seargent from that would be feldwebel . 
  yes waiting times can be a problem depending on where you are . 
  as for the homeopathy thing it 's very popular right now , so it 's not really a problem of the german system but germans . 
  apparently we like being scammed ... 
  d\u00fcsseldorf , germany favourite things : * the rhine * altbier least favourite : * we can be a bit pretentious at times * constant construction everywhere * way to few parkings spaces which turns any commute by car into a slalom race . 
  * to close to cologne / s, 
  can you expand on what you think is better about the czech system compared to germany ? 
  because for me it sounds almost the same . 
  or do you just mean wait times and such ? 
  rush - daniel br\u00fchl i think he did a terrific job and i thoroughly enjoyed the movie . 
  and in case rush does n't count as an american movie , he was also pretty good in civil war imho and of course there 's that other movie . 
  do n't know about that , but they did have people at the cash register that would pack your things in plastic bags for you . 
  that did not fly at all , since a lot of germans are very particular as to how exactly they want their shopping bags packed and would n't trust this important issue to anyone who does n't at least have a proper `` t\u00fctenpackbef\u00e4higungszeugnis '' . 
  not really , traditionally applewine will be uncarbonated and unfiltered . 
  but there are many variations , some of which come quite close to cider , which technically would be called apple sparkling wine `` apfel schaumwein '' or appfel sekt '' , but are often just labeled as apple wine . 
  a few manufacturers have actually started to sell those as cider . 
  looks more like dutch to me ... 
  well , feel free to use [ r\u00fcbenkraut ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuckerr%c3%bcbensirup ) instead . 
  die maus , [ obviously ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ckbwrv_shw&amp;list=pl1urmcvt1hbhpmvtgipqvisf5wzjogjly ), 
  most chinese food , but specifically : mapo tofu fish fragrant eggplant - yu xiang qie si ( or anything yu xiang , really ) red braised pork - hong shao rou, 
  so it can be used on signs and such , where everything is written in capitals . 
  well , i 'd rather become a rock star , but i suppose that 's up to you . 
  under normal traffic conditions 150-160 km/h is usually doable . 
  at least on 3-lane stretches of autobahn . 
  if there are only 2 lanes you will always eventually get stuck behind that one idiot who 's trying to overtake that truck going 100 by going 105 . 
  that 's a nice beer , but i prefer < any non local beer variant  . 
  what is version control ? 
  we have a script on the mainframe , that backs up the last version when a new one is installed . 
  that count 's right ? 
  ( death is for nothing and it costs your life . ), 
  it works in german because `` umsonst '' can mean both `` for nothing '' or `` in vain '' , but also for free . 
  so it is commonly used as a rebuke to people not wanting to pay for something . 
  also there was a tv show `` wa ( h ) re liebe '' which played on the fact that the german word for commodity ( ware ) and true ( wahre ) are pronounced the same . 
  so it could be understood as either commodity love or true love . 
   scottish stovies did a quick google for recipes and it seems to be more or less the same . 
  mostly potatoes and corned beef . 
  beet roots optional . 
  aqnd it 's glorious . 
  almost as good as knipp , which is another german thing foreigners might hate . 
   i think not liking s\u00fclt is among the unforgivable curses here . 
  it 's called s\u00fclze here , but still delicous . 
  how do you serve that stuff in estonia . 
  here we either just eat it on bread , or turn it into a salad with some vinnegraite , raddishes and shallots . 
  also some greens . 
  well like most german atrocities , he 's actually austrian , so there 's that . 
  `` im pott '' the universal address was `` meista '' when i lived there . 
  probably still is . 
  also `` cheffe '' , but rarer . 
  yes cologne . 
  very good city , very eco-conscious . 
  i hear they even recycle their piss as k\u00f6lsch to save water . 
  also big church . 
  huge . 
  tremendous . 
  great church . 
  and they made the mooslims pay for it . 
  i just read that and thought it was funny , when i realized , in german we have the same thing . 
  we do have a word for like , though , which makes it even weirder i suppose . 
  i guess i forget that one . 
  i prefer my horses as sauerbraten , anyway ... so maybe that 's why . 
  i think a closer match to the english '' to hop '' would be either `` hopsen '' or especially for bunnies `` hoppeln '' . 
  i 'd say `` h\u00fcpfen '' is probably closer to the english `` to skip '' . 
  though `` h\u00fcpfen '' and `` hopsen '' are pretty interchangable . 
  i think `` hoppeln '' is only used for bunnies and in `` hoppe , hoppe reiter '' .
