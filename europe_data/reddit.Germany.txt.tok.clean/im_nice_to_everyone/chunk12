  julia kl\u00f6ckner also changed her appearance and lost quite some [ weight ] ( http://img.shz.de/img/incoming/origs12563621/3043324972-w600-h960/1392825243-klockner.jpg ) . 
  this was a few months before she started her ( failed ) campaign to become state governor . 
  [ it 's crazy since the two most likely succesors for merkel rock that style too . 
  she really does . 
  this is fucking idiotic . 
  again you 're advocating for harming innocent people because someone else harmed innocent people . 
  are you serious ? 
  you 'd be attacking innocent people and be no better then these morons above . 
  are you out for retaliation ? 
  did my post offend you ? . 
  what 's the point of your remark and what does it have with the topic ? 
  this is n't a contest about which country is in better shape . 
  i think it has to do with the way the brexit is perceived here . 
  british politics looks like it 's in shambles with so much uncertainty and few people taking responsibility . 
  than there is also the eurosceptic afd who is currently imploding because of infighting within the party . 
  they literally had to split their parliamentary group in one of the regional parliaments . 
  they also do n't even know if they support the brexit or not . 
  merkel looked more or less level headed and with so much instability right now people will hang onto her . 
  she is also far more popular then / r/europe potrays her . 
  she had putin-esque approval ratings not too long ago . 
  liberal in the german spectrum is center-right though . 
  it 's different then the us labels . 
  he is also forgeting the 2/3 rebate on net payments britain got for quite some time . 
  they essentially got most of their money back and access to the biggest market in the world . 
  give them a break , they 're trying their best and building an airport is hard !, 
  no , but they atleast finished the car park this weekend . 
  the ber desaster has made postillon ( the onion equivalent ) articles come true . 
  it might be cheaper to just tear off the whole thing and build a new airport somewhere else then actually continuing to build on the construction already there . 
  it 's good that the spd is trying to take over it 's project 18 legacy . 
  their entire last political program was set around industry 4.0 and tryining to create and support a start up scene . 
  this is a blunt pr move . 
  i think they even called themselves the start-up party . 
  for everyone that would try to step up and either invoke article 50 or go against the referendum result . 
  you can only lose in that scenario . 
  berlin has been easily the worst organized city in germany for years now . 
  so , i would n't bet on that . 
  but it is still attractive for younger people and quite cheapishly for such an metropolitan area . 
  that 's why their moto is `` poor but sexy '' . 
  e : relevant song from the public transit administration [ `` i do n't care , whatever '' ] ( https://youtu.be/xvcpy4wjzms ) ( it has english subtitles ), 
  not going through with it would be political suicide i reckon . 
  but as of now what the political leaders can hope for is drag it out as much as possible and to strike a deal where they would give the impression of leaving without changing much . 
  still , nobody knows what 's going to happen and the fdp is trying to capitalize on the current uncertainty . 
  i already layed out my plans out to make my garden a financial services hub on a another post somewhere on this sub . 
  i also still have some room in my attic and a 100mbit connection . 
  it 's not exactly fiber , but you can work with it just fine .

  they rarely make use of oppositional instruments and are always dead last when it comes to actual inquiries of the parliaments or governments work . 
  this happens even though they are the biggest opposition in some parliaments . 
  they also always revert to the 3 same topics in their speeches and do n't talk much about anything else . 
  this is especially unfortunate because most of the things their criticizing are things the regional states have limited influence on . 
  they also have thorough contact with extrem right-wingers in the east and had to dissolve and regroup their association in the saarland because of neonazis taking over the party there . 
  to come back to their parliamentary work , i watched the first speech of every party following the first government declaration after the election in rhineland-palatinate . 
  the speeches of the two opposition parties cdu and afd were like day and night . 
  julia kl\u00f6ckner ( cdu ) totally dismantled and took apart the government and actually went straight ahead into substantive issues and government fuck ups in the state . 
  the afd just repeated the same speech about `` gender craze '' and `` multikulti dictatorship '' . 
  they did n't say anything about any of the issues in the state like selling the airport , the mittelrhein-bridge or the kita issue . 
  tl ; dr : the afd are easily the party doing the least work in parliament and spend their time with things like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/2wp_yoov3qq ) where they could do actual opposition work . 
  if i ever need a laugh , i 'll go back and read old / r/ukpolitics threads . 
  the fp\u00d6 experienced something similar in the early 00s and the afd showcases how incompetent the party is in the regional parliaments ( sadly few people are taking note of that ) . 
  this is the biggest `` i told you so '' moment in recent history . 
  it would be hilarious if it was n't so sad . 
  at second thought though even with the consequences , it is indeed still hilarious . 
  she is still very much a right winger and conservative . 
  this was especially apparent in the first few years , but she has moved the cdu a bit into the center and canibalized every one of her coalition partners with some decisions that were actually popular but not strictly conservative . 
  how i said , it 's mostly an issue of perception of the right wing of her party who wants the 90s conservatism back and have her take a more hardline stance . 
  she is n't but she is constantly blamed for abandoning conservatism from the right wing of the party . 
  it 's how she is perceived . 
  he is quite controversial . 
  he 's seen as the one upholding conservatism in the cdu and a good counter weight against merkel . 
  the left mostly hates him . 
   ** vice-chancellor sigmar gabriel wants to offer young britons german citizenship **   spd leader sigmar pleads for offering young britons german citizenship . 
  the referendum on the united kingdom 's membership in the european union was mostly decided by older voters in england and wales , gabriel said in berlin on saturday on a european congress of the spd . 
  `` they knew better than the snobs of the british elite that it was about their future . '', 
   now europe `` should n't just pull up the drawbridge . '', 
  we must think about what we could offer the young britons , the minister said . 
  the spd has always been for dual citizenship . 
  `` let us offer it the young britons who live in germany , italy or france , so that they can remain eu citizens in this country . '', 
   similar statements were made by the members of the green party the week prior . 
  the eu countries should offer young brits on the continent immediate legal certainty about their future status , said the leader of the green parliament group in the european parliament , rebecca harms . 
  `` this can go from the right of residence to the offer of citizenship . '', 
    gabriel now called on eu states to take a hard line in the exit negotiations with britain . 
  `` only haggle , then fail and then cling - that is the motto , which we must not give up . '', 
  one should `` prevent likely imitators from bringing europe in even more trouble . '', 
  therefore , we now must quickly provide clarity , gabriel said . 
   chancellery chief peter altmaier ( cdu ) seems to have a different view . 
  he said to swr2 on saturday when asked about a possible withdrawal from the brexit decision : `` this is , quite frankly , a question that needs to be discussed in the uk . '', 
  the debates in the uk have only just begun , and germany does well to hold back with advice to the british parliament . 
  leading british conservatives have already stated that they there wo n't be a formal exit request until after 2016 . 
  gabriel demands from the cdu and csu to be considerate with the british government . 
  `` the german conservatives have a great responsibility to ensure that it does not cleave europe . '', 
    ** more power for communities and countries **   gabriel sees the british withdrawal from the eu also an opportunity : `` if it something good can come out of this , then , that we change europe to give it more approval again . 
  we have to make europe better ... '' of which depends the future of germany and its jobs . 
  furthermore , the exit of great britain is not irreversible . 
  the country could return to the eu again . 
  `` i am sure that historically this is an episode , no epoch . '', 
    gabriel specifically pleaded for slimming down the european institutions . 
  it is `` urgently needed to throw off ballast , '' he told the neue osnabr\u00fccker zeitung on saturday . 
  a structure in which 27 commissioners wanted to prove themselves does n't make sense .
