   besides the fact i think waterboarding did happen under his administration to find osama bin laden . 
  did it though ? 
  i thought basically all reports said that waterboarding was so useless that they did n't get any useful information out of it . 
  in fact a lot of the inmates were innocent and just made shit up to make the treatment stop . 
  redemption sex . 
  estonia also can into glorious nordic . 
  all the guys leaving will leave us with old people which pensions we will have to pay . 
  brb looking up some nice na cities . 
  number two will arouse you !, 
  you ca n't take anyone serious who uses the term l\u00fcgenpresse ( lying press ) unironicly . 
  those people see some clickbait articles on the internet and opinion pieces they do n't like and then go on to discredit the whole press , reading rt or some right wing nutjobs blog . 
  they also do n't have any form of media competence and ca n't understand that there is no totally neutral source . 
  only if you believe trumps outrageous claims . 
  this guy clearly has n't a plan and will say * anything * to get elected . 
  you just ca n't trust him and it 's not like he is imune private interest in politics either . 
  i would have let him finish his pizza . 
  this is just basic human decency . 
  i do n't think that he is german . 
  after all [ this ] ( http://ais.badische-zeitung.de/piece/04/ac/b7/d9/78428121.jpg ) is how most germans feel about it . 
  that 's why people are opposing it . 
  i personally think that it 's ridiculous . 
  but it 's a fair shot away from gender roles caused cologne . 
  words , the article tries to put into his mouth . 
  their is enough room to attack this legislation without it . 
  what the fucking hell , bosnia !, 
  he did n't say that sexist ads caused cologne . 
  he said that he wants to implement a new image of gender roles . 
  for [ man ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spam/satire-spiegel-online-maas-werbung-diskriminierung-a-1087100.html ) and for women . 
  his proposal also has been worked on before cologne . 
  you can dislike it , as i do , but do n't just make up stuff . 
  there was a picture in a german newspaper with her and her daughter . 
  the signature said : '' marine le pen ( to the right ) and her daughter ( further right ) '', 
  not if you have a `` minijob '' though . 
  but that would mean that you earn less then 450 $ a month though . 
  merkel does n't try to be kohl . 
  in fact she [ backstabbed ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/merkel-in-der-faz-kohl-hat-der-partei-schaden-zugefuegt-a-57495.html ) helmut kohl to take over a leading role in the party . 
  helmut kohl is just a bitter politican who fell from grace and should be lucky that he was n't prosecuted for [ corruption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cdu_donations_scandal?wprov=sfla1 ), 
  it 's not like the austrians have been a victim during the 3rd reich . 
  that is an historic myth to get out of [ responsibility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victim_theory?wprov=sfla1 ) . 
  [ hey ! ], 
  ( https://youtu.be/0zuc4mmmzcg ), 
  democracy is more then ballot fetishism . 
  a democracy which does n't honour the basic rights of everyone and protects the minority from the arbitrariness of the majority is n't a democracy . 
  obama is n't a general failure . 
  a president is bound by the factual constraints of his office and considering these boundaries and the fierce obstructionism he faced i would say that he did quite well . 
  there is a lot to critique and he disappointed compared to the high aspirations , but to call him a failure is definitely not right . 
  killing people non-combatant people without a trial . 
  what are we trying to defend here ? 
  the lack of italians in this thread really says a lot :d, 
  yep , it 's a german conspiracy . 
  it 's something you can find on a lot of subs , especially since the refugee crisis started . 
  it 's prevelant in / r/europe and / r/de too if you look at the threads concerning any kind of immigrant . 
  semi-sarcastic comments adding nothing to the conversation get upvoted to the top and real discussion get drowned out . 
  also there are a lot of accounts who just post and comment on issues regarding immigrants . 
  it 's not that there are n't any problems around certain groups but the hateful discussion and focusing on those few topics really drives me off . 
  take / r europe for example . 
  before some of the political crisis dominated the news , this was a place of cultural exchange and learning about the other countries in europe . 
  fucking words , how do they work ? 
  actually europe and as such the eu is mostly comrpomised by right wing government . 
  the eu is checking if pis acted against democratic standards poland signed onto when they entered the union . 
  they also do n't interfere in polands inner politic but act on poland within the framework of the eu . 
  it 's actually exactly what they want . 
  there was a a terrorism researcher on phoenix after the brussels attacks who said that the is wants to lure western miliatary into syria for there apocaliptic ideology . 
  they also thrive on chaos and that situation would mess up the geopolitical situation in syria even further . 
  i think , that 's it 's especially the war on drugs which led to these conditions . 
  the very restrictive drug policies made it a very lucrative business . 
  just look at the hike in incaeration rate around the reagan years , when the war on drugs got reinforced . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://fcnl.org/resources/newsletter/septoct11/prison_rates_1880.jpg ), 
  also interesting is the recent shift in radicalizing and politicizing religious beliefs in the middle east after a time were secular and panarabic ideologies were more present . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_revival?wprov=sfla1 this is also the catalysing point for terrorism as we know it today . 
  which if we 're honest is no big feat . 
  it 's also important to state that it 's german/austrian propaganda from the early 18th century . 
  i lost my hand because i stole an apple . 
  it 's fine though , i really deserved it anyway . 
  it 's certainly something new for merkel . 
  she had putin-level approval ratings before last summer . 
  no , we should stop outscouring our unemployment and force austerity on our neighbours . 
  we live under our means and and grow our low-paying sector with precarious working conditions . 
  okay , this is just childish . 
  [ cnn - breaking news : the titanic sunk 102 years ago tonight ! ], 
  ( http://www.businessinsider.com/cnn-breaking-news-titanic-sinking-2014-4?ir=t ), 
  i think it 's hilarious , especially the race to the bottom . 
  you should n't take it too serious . 
  read kant , you cunt !, 
  the eurovision is one of the greatest things european integration has brought us !, 
  the prices in germany have gone up and up over the last few years too . 
  my parents bought a 150m \u00b2 house in a town not that far away from frankfurt . 
  this cost them 300k $ in 2007 . 
  in 2016 houses just down the road go for half the space and without a garden and basement for 1 and half the prices . 
  like / u/ajuc already posted , you can just hang them inside too . 
  it 's not really that big of a deal and does n't take up that much space either . 
   because we tolerate their lifestyle choices here , but as soon as they do n't tolerate ours there , `` r/europe '' jumps at exposing the hypocrisy . 
   that 's a very vague * they * you 're using . 
  i think it was axel springer who said that `` news are just a vehicle to sell ads '' . 
  the burda publishing newspapers and magazines like focus are even more extrem in this regard . 
  it 's actually very sad that the news editorial staff are shrinking since i think that we actually have really great news outlets apart from springer and burda . 
  especially the guardian gets a lot of shit in this sub for being left-leaning and people are judging it for it 's online content but than they are also the ones who helped snowden reveal the nsa spying . 
  but in this case it was the german s\u00fcddeutsche who got their hands on the documents and passed it on to other investigative journalists . 
   now hold my beer while i solve global warming . 
  how do you solve something that does n't exist ?
