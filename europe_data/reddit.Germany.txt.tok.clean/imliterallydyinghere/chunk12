  yes , it 's the best .

  use the correct term for it : heimat there is no english word for it . 
  good biathletes . 
  especially darya domracheva .

   teutonic efficiency as someone with a family that extends 50 cousins and second cousins i approve of this . 
  i hope this stereotype catches on before i leave for vacation . 
  so spread the word : germans are best lovers * ^ ^ * your ^ ^ personal ^ ^ experience ^ ^ may ^ ^ differ, 
  easy to confuse as both glorious areas are at best level a.k.a. 
  sea level . 
  he can handle it either way . 
  when he 's on the far left i would n't want him in a position of power . 
  every political spectrum that is far from the middle is the wrong one imo . 
  you 're supposed to thank your mother and father for believing in you when nobody else did . 
  we outsexed the romans back in the days . 
  nobody can compete with our fertility when we are in the mood . 
  not even rabbits . 
  we were on the right side with the first one !, 
  well at least if there 'd have been a right side to begin with . 
  we won against norway in the final of the european championship in women football . 
  6 title in a row ~ . ~, 
  us germans are responsible for the delay of the fehmarnbelt though . 
  sorry about that . 
  not never but not so often and when it happens it 's rather one drunk guy against another drunk guy and not 5 turks beating up one guy who 's already on the ground . 
  you have the most beautiful natural looking women . 
  it was mostly aimed towards your women . 
  thank your women football team for that . 
  this guy is so fucking retarded . 
  bavaria why are you punishing us with your fucking cunts from the csu . 
  friedrich alone is enough reason for me to change my mind and not vote for the cdu . 
  this guy is so pathetic i wish someone would put him out of his misery . 
  what a vasall that he goes to the us when the fucktards of american politicians should come to us and at least explain it here . 
  best german neighbour by a margin . 
  annies kiosk has the best hotdogs terrible drivers , try to prevent to be around them on the street . 
  terrible sweets ( true for all scandinavian countries ), 
  and it certainly differs from my understanding of vacation . 
  what chinese tourists do is exhausting . 
  there is no country they 're not able to explore within 2 weeks . 
  even if it means to spend 12 hours a day in a bus and only stop at the tourist spots for a maximum of 10 minutes for pictures . 
  and maybe even mark the countries your plane passed as visited on that world map hanging in your living room . 
  leaving out the local cuisine is like visiting rome using google street view ... at least one speciality should be tasted, 
  take note italy , spain and france, 
  something something abyss nietzsche, 
  that was pretty smart by snowden . 
  he forces every nation where he applies for asylum to have a discussion about it and now every politician has to pick a side or is a coward . 
  i expect that a few minor politicans from every party will agree with the population so we can calm down ... 
  is n't that irritating ? 
  i always read subtitles even if i do n't need them . 
  if charlies angel 2 teached me anything you are absolutely wrong . 
  she knows how it works . 
  wearing jack wolfskin for jogging is the best camouflage to appear as a german . 
  10/10 - would invite for currywurst, 
  it 's actually bandage . 
  http://www.luckylola.de/bilder/produkte/normal/di000117_pflaster-bacon.jpg i had them too . 
  they are n't good, 
  at least you could dodge gez !, 
  but seriously 27 $ is a joke . 
  your parents seem to earn too much . 
  i could easily afford everything i needed with my baf\u00f6g . 
  of course my summer vacation had to be paid by my savings . 
  and i did n't even receive the maximum . 
   ... which is n't exactly a good argument for lowering the age . 
  usually , the only people advocating lowering the age requirements for voting are the people who are below it , usually the parties with young voters are advocating to lower the age . 
  like the pirate party, 
  among the bigger countries we are the only one not going full retard and you say we got one uped ... i love how everyone accuses germany of doing the same but nobody can proof that germany does it even close to a margin of countries like sweden , uk or usa . 
  as if you all need some legitimacy from elsewhere for the shit your government is been doing ... 
  what is going on between england and norway ? 
  so much traffic ? 
  agreed . 
  but you know for sure that all the big ones are n't trustworthy at all so in terms of privacy it is most likely better . 
  i only know brezel : /,

  my d\u00f6ner experience is limited to northern germany . 
  but i only crave for a d\u00f6ner 2-3 times a year . 
  almost every single kebab store is doing the same 2 mistakes though . 
  1 . bread is too soft after it absorbed the sauce 2 . only meat left at your last bites .

  so maybe that 's why i really do n't like the taste of their cheese fondue . 
  i do like the possibilities the new kinect offers . 
  such a shame it 's going to be wasted on the xbox one . 
  xbox one is n't going to take off anyway imo . 
  especially not outside of europe as it focuses too much on the american customer with cod and ea sportgames . 
  it may have its niche as an entertainment box but i do n't see the point in buying it when the ps4 has better hardware and more games in general and more exclusive games as well . 
  1,2 and 7 are rather an aftermath of winning ww1 and 2 . 
  astrid lindgren fooled us all into believing that . 
  well the u.s. is producing an american version of almost every succesful european movie ( girl with the dragon tattoo amongst others ) . 
  result being same as using protectionism, 
  what ? 
  they 're like the nicest people i 've met abroad . 
  they always asked me questions about divided germany and reunification which was a bit weird . 
   girl i bought coffee from got pissed off when i tried to give her correct change . 
  so you did n't leave a tip for her ? 
  on the other hand newspapers like die zeit are n't any better . 
  they just cover the left political spectrum .
