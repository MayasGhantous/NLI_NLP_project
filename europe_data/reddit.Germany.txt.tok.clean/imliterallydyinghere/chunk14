  i like that . 
  ^ ^ did ^ ^ you ^ ^ invent ^ ^ mozartkugeln ^ ^ only ^ ^ to ^ ^ claim ^ ^ mozart ? 
  sean connery comes to mind . 
  and ewan mc gregor as well as gerard butler ( only actors ), 
  moving to the next tax haven . 
  within the eu there should be enough pressure for this not to happen . 
  that is n't really all that much . 
  especially after he predicts the correct winner in the champions league this season . 
  isnt it all playback ? 
  and all scandinavian countries plus finland and estonia giving most points to each other . 
  they gave us 5 points . 
  jews are our only friends left at this point . 
  in the past that was the case but tell me any minor case of the recent past where german culture influenced the us . 
  and tokio hotel does n't count in my opinion . 
  that would imply that german culture has any effect on us culture but that is not the case . 
  in regards of debt pooling we agree with her . 
  any party that allow that that to happen would commit political suicide for decades . 
  you would n't start ww3 because of football ?!? 
  ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ do n't !, 
  the most shocking moment was when i realised that my beloved germany seems to be the epicenter of hipsterland . 
  12 points to hungary ... i blame hamburg , berlin and cologne . . 
  this ... sucks ... fml well at least we 'll win the champions league . 
  you ca n't take that from us, 
  have you tried it icecold ? 
  i was disappointed by the lack of almost nude women on stage . 
  the moderators of the countries were so much nicer to look at . 
  thanks norway and ukraine for keeping it up . 
  they both looked amazing . 
  i still hope she attends night of the proms in december . 
  retrorespectively ( ? ), 
  i feel sorry for you now . 
  i called for you guys . 
  and i 'm not even gay . 
  i just like the fifth element alot . 
  and someone needs to add another panel to [ denmarks history ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pz2da.jpg ), 
  for all of us sore losers here at least we do n't have to be compared with such a wonderful host like sweden this year . 
  it was perfect . 
  denmark will have a hard time topping that next year . 
  should hit frontpage with / r/worldnews topic about it http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1elloz/denmark_won_the_esc_2013/, 
  as i said before scandinavian countries ruin the eurovision like the eastern countries did a few years ago . 
  i hope we drop out of the esc ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ incredible ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ butthurt, 
  one pity point from switzerland ... denmark , netherlands , austria and switzerland i 'm disappointed . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  i think denmarks song will annoy us all to no end when it is played 5x/hour on the radio . 
  scandinavia you bloody opportunists ... 
  have i missed something recently or what is it about the tensions between russian and belarus ? 
  only 8 points from belarus to russia and none from russia to belarus . 
  that 's odd, 
  norway is way hotter imho, 
  i doubt we 'll ever see another country winning this who is n't from scandinavia . 
  they give all their points to each other and nobody has a grudge on them . 
  it 's like eurovision 5 years ago with the eastern countries . 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ butthurt, 
  sweden and norway ... come on . 
  israel is n't as butthurt about it though ;p, 
  5 points from israel . 
  i can sleep tonight . 
  yay, 
  netherlands ... & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; ^ ^ u ^ ^ dicks, 
  what anime character is that ? 
  already the second joke about peeing . 
  in normal circumstances that 'd be odd but this is eurovision . . 
  from now i refuse to take any criticism from swedens when it comes to humour !, 
  edit : ok that prime minister sketch was solid . 
  edit2 : i take it back . 
  it may be the alcohol be speaking but i 'm having a blast . 
  naah personally i 'm unsure who to vote for . 
  my groins says norway but i 'd rather want to vote for romania, 
  ronja robbersdaughter sure has grown up . 
  and apparently she finally catched those harpyies, 
  ok austria and switzerland you know what to do . 
  be good neighbours for once !, 
  ^ ^ * cough *, 
  this year so many countries are appealing to the gay audience . 
  he was blonde by arabic standards, 
  so norway this year more than 7 points ? 
  :p edit : yep . 
  blonde chick should be enough to top that . 
  edit 2 : why is the stereotypical swedish person today from norway ? 
  no bad words about bonnie taylor . 
  she 's was awesome at her prime and is still incredible . 
  i 'd do everything to party with her when she was younger . 
  [ this evening takes it toll ] ( http://imgur.com/mumighu ) ... ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ ^ eurovision, 
  it 's a trick to attract german and british tourists . 
  and it 'll work . 
  that 's the favourite ? 
  was n't that great tbh . 
  hipster hungary, 
  my sympathy goes out to the poor men and women in the crowd who have to wave a flag for 3 hours straight . 
  nice . 
  she 's awesome edit : good song . 
  romania is pulling a dracula . 
  i like that . 
  the song is catchy enough for eurovision, 
  her hair is n't fancy enough for eurovision and her gesture is weird . 
  lynda woodruff looks like rita skeeter from harry potter, 
  is n't iceland split between the american continent and the european ? 
  i watch it only because of geo-political factors . 
  than i get mad at austria and switzerland for being bad neighbours who do n't call for us . 
  those dicks always give back less than we get them !,
