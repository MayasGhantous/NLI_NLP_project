  makes me feel like odysseus as he passed the sirens . 
  i think german became just known as rough language due to foreign war movies . 
  i would never say that german sounds harsher than any other language except for maybe french . 
  in the beginning the girl on the right looks like a young fergie . 
  it lacks hollywood . 
  they use their radar traps in positions where it is almost impossible not to be a tad to fast ( which is more then enough to get a unreasonable high fine ) for example right after the speed limit changed and they 'll pick you as a tourist because they know you 're more likely to concede . 
  in terms of driver be careful the further you go to the east . 
  they get a bit ruthless there ( on the street ) . 
  and be extremly careful in switzerland , the police will try to rip you off ( at least with a german plate ) . 
  and with a motorcycle i suggest you add slovenia on your route . 
  no tolls and more fun with motorcycle . 
  where is the difference except that g + is some sort of desert for all i know ( have n't used it ), 
  do you know if we 'll be able to see the meteor ? 
  we hate the csu and we like bavaria . 
  i come from l\u00fcbeck and we speak high german . 
  so unlike people with other dialects i do n't mumble . 
  and btw . 
  someone from berlin is really hard to understand . 
  oh boy , i hate to break it to you but it 's actually berlin . 
  always berlin . 
  you just ca n't do anything right except for partying . 
  it 's cringeworthy to watch . 
  i guess in germany she 'd have the best chances ( still not worth mentioning ) . 
  i would n't mind if it means i get an extra day off on queens day . 
  such a shame that your grandfather was yet able to produce offsprings, 
  he ** must ** be euphoric at this very moment !, 
  this will increase as more and more people change their destination for their vacation from egypt to other tourists countries like portugal and greece . 
  dae think that stalin did good ?!, 
  we can not into papst anymore :(, 
   trollh\u00e4ttan why is this city almost as famous as stockholm ? 
  ace of base and g\u00fcnther disagree . 
  make a sitcom out of it and sell it to the uk . 
  you would n't believe how much work is still ahead of them . 
  oslos city hall . 
  why is it the first thing people see when they come by ferry to beautiful norway, 
  canadians are worse . 
  sooo much worse . 
  they ca n't take criticism at all . 
  on the other hand they love their `` sorry '' attitude and being condescending towards any other nations especially the usa . 
  yeah ... that was n't religiously motivated at all . 
  jellyfishes are from space , that 's for sure . 
  just thinking about the precious miliseconds i waste everyday downloading scientific pdf files !, 
  most of them grow up to be the most dependent persons you can meet . 
  they 'd starve to death if it were n't for instant noodles . 
  so why do we deserve to be punished by sylvie van der vaart ? 
  just watching the news . 
  wilhelm alexander is involved in environmental conservation ? 
  is n't his mother the biggest single shareholder of shell ? 
  that is true for almost every politician . 
  if we only had our wilhelm :*(, 
  i learned that in a jackie chan movie . 
  california was ruined before he became governor . 
  impossible . 
  your mountains force your bodies to stay slim and in shape . 
  that 's why i 'm 2cm taller than you ~ ~ germkn\u00f6del is n't part of a healthy breakfast you know, 
  i 'm 1,84 m and i fell like one at times . 
  especially the women here are insanely tall . 
  sometimes ? 
  it 's in about 90 % of all recipes . 
  finally i 'm danish again.\u00f8l, 
  high tide, 
  italys boots became a club foot, 
  leipzig and dresden really are more comopolitan . 
  saving water is bad for the drainage . 
  in some german cities they urge the people to use more water . 
  scarce resource ? 
  not in most of europe . 
  and it does n't matter if you waste it or not as it 's not lost . 
   balanced budget by 2016 . 
  good one . 
  they 'll always be germanies dumpster . 
  woosh, 
  it 's one of those where everyone who attended enjoyed it ( at least all my friends really loved their time at the army/civilian service ) but we all had our doubts about it beforehand . 
  as calvin 's dad would say : `` it builds charakter '', 
  do n't a lot of young people use the military to earn some money before attending a university ? 
  is that what you mean ? 
   they just pass over us . 
  i do n't like the direction those air troops are going . 
  civilian service is fantastic for a society . 
  it brings people in touch with it in a young age . 
  good for austria that they keep it . 
  old yes but i doubt they are often sick . 
  china is using protectionism in almost every industry . 
  you cant succeed against that without protectionism, 
   oh god , the commenters even started to blame eastern european states for uk 's troubles . 
  this is getting hilarious . 
  i 'm pleasantly surprised that i had to scroll to page 2 until i read the word nazi . 
  throw out anyone possible as soon as they cause any trouble . 
  if they ca n't be deported to their homecountries and they commited a noteworthy crime they can be put to jail . 
  and do n't let them bring their families from their homecountries , if they want to be near them they should go back . 
  at least in germany lots of arabic people in general do n't have a german passport but i guess jurisdiction is to forgiving to send them back to wherever they came from . 
  only the really hard cases get send back . 
  i wish we 'd banish everyone causing trouble after the second crime . 
   european carriers have been ** slow to roll out 4g networks ** , and still largely rely on text and voice call fees , rather than the data-centric plans most us providers have introduced . 
  the risk , however , is that at&t would have to contend with a more competitive market , while operating within an entirely different set of ** industry regulations ** . 
  is n't that the reason why we 're slow on that ? 
  that the providers first have to make it available to the rural areas before they 're allowed to set it up in the bigger cities due to regulations, 
  it 's funny that your only counter argument to a well-rounded troll like ufrastratedbro is finlands higher than usual suicide rate . 
  when that 's their only problem we can all envy them . 
  and for you the norway history tl ; dr http://i.imgur.com/ddtwk.png,
