  will scotland consider driving on the right side of the street if they gain independence ? 
  just think about all these tourists you could safe !, 
  since kurds do n't have a state this should n't apply to them .

  personally paris is my favourite big city in europe ( along with prague and i have n't visisted that many other big cities ),

  default big subreddits are full of weirdos who feel the need to share it with the world that they adopted some foster cat i do n't give a fuck about or how they cried when they saw this and that movie/picture/cake / whatever . 
  i do n't think germans would share or be open about this kind of gef\u00fchlsduselei . 
  i still ask myself what kind of grown man post shit like `` i 'm a grown bearded badass dude and i cried reading/eating/watching / listening this . 
  makes me want to puke . 
  but i could be totally wrong on this .

  for them it makes sense but germany gets a much better price from russia . 
  everything worth fighting for, 
  so what if he 's an australian living in europe ? 
  in that case his opinion on the matter is just as relevant as everyone elses,
