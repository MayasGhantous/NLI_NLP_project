  my sister got shot at while there for kayaking , they really do n't like people from anywhere but corsica . 
  it was more of a warning shot to scare them . 
  new york , sedar point amusement park in ohio , coast of maine , yellowstone . 
  there are many more i just forgot about at the moment . 
   germany 's rich i lol 'd, 
  are n't new zealanders sheep shaggers ? 
  and the brits inselaffen = island monkeys . 
  though you only hear it when we play against them in football . 
  sausage german sounds like a compliment . 
  i only eat the fish i catch myself . 
  only bass and herring because i suck at fishing ... 
  have they considered papers in other languages than english ? 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_seven_years%27_war fond memories when we were allies . 
   do you have any studies that actually support the correlation between ethnicity and propensity for criminality i doubt that these exist . 
  but 42 % of all turkish people within the working age in berlin do n't have a job . 
  and that 's because 70 % only finish their basic secondary education which makes it difficult to find a job . 
  immigrants from other countries ( vietnam , poland , etc ) usually are better at school than the average german . 
  it seems that they do n't think that a good education is important ( or at least for the man ) . 
  turkish women on the other hand speak better german and receive their university entrance diploma ( abitur ) more often than turkish men . 
  he has a point : http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=datei:herkunft_intensivt%c3%a4ter.png&amp;filetimestamp=20100410163731 4 in 5 crimes commited by immigrants in berlin the offender is turkish or arabic . 
  even though it has become an insult to call an italian `` itaker '' it originally comes from the war and referred to `` italienischer kamerad '' = italian companion . 
  do n't forget to call us `` krauts '', 
  a story in that regard . 
  in the german parliaments the politicians have a budget for their office supplies and if they do n't use it up until the end of the year they buy luxury pens ( 5.000 $ ) and ipads and stuff and gift it to their family and friends or keep it for themselves . 
  when the reporter found that out they forbid to investigate in that regard ... 
  no the stuff you need everyday like bread , eggs , shampoo and stuff . 
  i included them with the fast moving consumer goods . 
  it 's not just slightly cheaper . 
  it 's a lot cheaper ( except for the fast moving consumer goods ), 
  most of these people just want to be different for the sake of it and that 's pathetic . 
  fair enough . 
  but the uk will have more citizens than germany by 2050 ( or sooner ) and will be the biggest country within the eu ( if turkey does n't join until then ), 
  i 'm currently moving to bavaria ... i 'm worried ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ inb4someone ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ brags ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ his ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ til ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ knowledge ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pagan ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ stuff ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ being ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ used ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ christians . 
  no imagine it without the small skyscrapers . 
  so much better . 
  monti !, 
  ireland attracted all these big it companies , i hope they do n't let them slip every attack on our internet privacy . 
  at the end they need us more than we need them . 
  until you realise that they 're reading sun and bild, 
  or germany and the other bigger countries have to vote on a federal state level . 
  only until the next crisis . 
  at this point i wouldnt want the uk be part of it even though they belongcin there, 
  just remember that whatever your towel touches is yours and should n't be released without a fight . 
  depends on the neighborhood, 
   in fact , i 'd faster vote for anschluss of portugal into the federal german republic than i 'd vote for the portuguese exit of the eu , but maybe that 's just me . 
  all our efforts in the annexation of mallorca would then be wasted, 
  germany also has a lot of guns apparently . 
  we are ranked 14 at guns/capita . 
  does n't fit with my impression . 
  have n't seen a gun in years except for the ones used by the police used as an acessory . 
  i suppose everyone would be shooting everyone else thinking that they just shot the bad guy . 
  just wait until miriam g\u00f6ssner gets better at the shooting range !, 
  she 's half-norwegian too !, 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzwel4dgynk she 's always in a good mood . 
  even before her start . 
  and btw . 
  who decided to make oslos city hall so damn unattractive to look at ? 
  northern germany , learned these from my mother ans she is from nordfriesland . 
  you still have tora berger . 
  nutella does n't belong in the fridge . 
  read the instructions !, 
  my city-centre is currently swedish territory for as long as the christmas market is here . 
  in some parts of germany we eat [ birnen , bohnen , speck ] ( http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/birnen-bohnen-speck-eintopf-f32e9f798268bc95cf52fa0f73158177_fjt2008110181.jpg ) and [ liver with apple slices and onion ] ( http://cdn.chefkoch.de/ck.de/rezepte/80/80957/214812-big-leber-in-apfel-zwiebelsosse.jpg ) not really that weird though . . and we eat sweet popcorn , salty popcorn is disgusting , i felt like a sheep licking on a stone when i tried it ... 
  46 % of turkish immigrants in germany want more muslims in germany than christians . 
  but i guess most religious people want that for their religion . 
  is ... is that a joke ? 
  now this is a comment worth reporting . 
  / r/postcollapse disagrees with you . 
  there is a good number of americans who are prepared for basically everything . 
  you have to study theology at a university . 
  and it 's not easy . 
  steinbr\u00fcck let banks write their own laws when he was finance minister . 
  i wish they would change their name . 
  so embarassing ... 
  we 're heading in the same direction . 
  5-10 more years at best . 
  they did n't break any rules but it was immoral afterall . 
  it does n't matter that every other company is doing the same in that matter . 
  there is no ghettoization in australia because australia chooses wisely who can come to their country and those people usually adapt and integrate into a society . 
  same goes for canada . 
  you always start that discussion and it never leads to anything . 
  why are n't they allowed to sell it in greece ? 
  i do ^ ^ ^ ** ^ ** n't get it ... 
  i do n't think it 's spamming . 
  i rather think that some people like myself are n't that opened towards excessive and bad immigration policies . 
  i get the impression that the ones shouting racism are always up in arms against other redditors who are on the center-right on the political spectrum while they 're on the far left . 
  of course at times there are racist comments but when someone is against multiculturism it 's not racist per se . 
  edit : the same discussion appeared on / r/worldnews about south africa and this comment is worth a read . 
  of course , best thing you can do is use several sources of information to form your own opinion . 
  here is another report from die zeit . 
   \u00d6stermalm / stureplan basically sodom and gomorrha of sweden, 
  written by a contributor to / r/atheism . 
  oh the irony ... 
  who votes for people just because their different than all the other politicians . 
  and ... he uses memes & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  you 're forgetting about how desperate the greens are to form a government . 
  in 5 years when we can vote for kraft . 
  just out of interest but what was brothers grimm contribution to linguistics ? 
  and sorry that marx = communism = evil in this subreddit , apparently they do n't know any better . 
  please explain that , i 'd like to know why you put marx on one level with hitler .
