  that would bring it closer to completion . 
  at that point we obviously got invaded by a benevolent force that i 'd gladly support, 
  do n't get me wrong i 'm not actively hostile towards them i just do n't want to interact with them in any way . 
  i pay my taxes that helps them and that is already more than enough if you ask me . 
   so it has nothing to do with religion and it 's entirely fixable . 
  is it though ? 
  and when it 's so easy as you claim how comes that every western country failed with that for the last 50 years ? 
  and if you ca n't educate them what jobs could they hope for ? 
  cleaning , making d\u00f6ner and sisha lounges ? 
  and what are you always talking about fake propaganda , living in a bubble and facts ? 
  what facts did i get wrong ? 
  what facts did we even discuss for fucks sake ? 
  it 's not like you 're throwing facts around that support your point of view . 
  so please stop accusing me of fake propaganda . 
  and btw . 
   the `` worst '' has already passed . 
  is bullshit . 
  these recent years were just the start and lybia especially and africa in general is full of people waiting on their chance to come here . 
  as you can see i wrote about how i see it and the people i know . 
  and when it comes to berlin i 'd support whoever wants to take that burden from us ; , 
  not that surprising considering the burden of our past, 
  that 's true . 
  hard to specifically say why but neither me nor most of the people i know would defend our country and just get out before shtf . 
  do n't know if that 's just sad or if we learned from the past . 
  it 's just impossible to love this country although i 'm happy that i 'm currently living here . 
   lol . 
  you are n't . 
   i 'm not predicting ? 
  i thought i just did . 
   germany has the most immigrants in the whole eu . 
  it also has a budget ** deficit ** . 
    we do ? 
     yep . 
     german budget surplus soars as economy motors ahead you made a typo there that 's why i asked `` we do ? '', 
    dunno do n't care that 's the alt rights 's motto when it comes to facts . 
   no , i do n't know or care what the alt-right is claiming the immigrants to do . 
  at least not here in this discussion . 
   how so ? 
  they 're poor , uneducated and with a background that overall could n't be successfully integrated anywhere in the western world ( canada , usa and australia do n't count since they were smart enough to only allow the best and brightest to come ) . 
  the other option would be a red-red-green coalition . 
  they supported merkels course and would have gone even further with it back then and maybe even now . 
  at least that 's what many of merkels supporter are worried about . 
  so it 's more that she is the lesser of 2 evils that you are even used to so why not vote for her again . 
  or you vote for the fdp because the afd is too extreme and you ca n't vote for merkel because of 2015 so they 're the only option left for us who are not living in bavaria . 
  of course they 're good germans by now . 
  i never said that immigration is bad . 
  we have lots of great former immigrants from iran , vietnam , poland , russia , etc. 
  who had no problem integrating here . 
  but chances are if they 're from a muslim country in the middle east or north africa that is n't iran than they 're most likely performing worse in any aspect you want to measure successful integration with . 
  not all muslims are bad but the number is way too high for the rest to make up for it . 
   of course not . 
  you 're perfect . 
  :d of course not but i 'm not the bundeskanzler so i have to deal with other probems than merkel . 
  all i 'm saying is that the problem she caused has to be solved by her and her followers and not by people who disagreed with her policies . 
  because i predict that in a few years when integration of these kind of people failed once again the left will blame the right for being responsible for it because we did n't let them feel welcome enough . 
   it also has a budget deficit we do ? 
   is n't the `` alt right '' claiming that immigrants are `` stealing '' their jobs and are bringing the economy to a stand-still ? 
  or is that just in the us ? 
  dunno do n't care  us has the worst immigrants , right ? 
  we have the worst refugees and asylum seekers . 
  that part of our immigration is the worst but the immigrants a country wants to have is pretty good  you 're being delusional . 
   these passive aggressive smileys ... urgh, 
  no , i blame them for not forcing them to go back without any ideas on how to integrate them . 
  even helmut schmidt later said it was a mistake . 
   so you 're probably talking about yourself , your relatives or your friends . 
  not myself or relatives but i do have friends that came here after ww2 . 
  they 're not from the group of people i 'm talking about though . 
   what are you dealing with ? 
  i did n't make a mistake nor did i ever support unchecked immigration from refugees . 
  of course the one who fucked up has to deal with it and so far not even the left is convinced with her deal with turkey . 
   germany has the most immigrants out of all the eu . 
  it also has a budget surplus . 
   not because of muslim immigrants who are on the wrong end of any sociological statistic you can find ( unless they 're iranian , we got good ones from there who i think are even better than the average ) . 
  but no one is feeling pressured enough to make a change in policies . 
  some half hearted attempts are being pursuit but by this tempo we probably have tighter immigration by 2030 . 
  it has been known that 2015 ca n't happen even again and yet here we are 2 years later still on the verge of another flood with still high number of now mostly economic refugees coming here being brought here by our own communities that do the ferry service and the eu not being able to stop them from it . 
   when you said `` children or grandchildren of people that should either have been integrated properly back in the days '' you just described the majority of the us population . 
  by that logic , we are all immigrants . 
  no , i 'm talking about the immigration to europe that happened post ww2 . 
   xenophobia also does n't help . 
   so the left fucked up and now i as a conservative have to behave like i welcome refugees like they do so it does n't get worse ? 
  maybe these folks should n't have fucked up to begin with instead of blaming everyone that does n't fall for their mistake to be responsible because they do n't let muslims feel as welcome as the left does . 
  that 's too close to merkels `` wir schaffen das '' . 
  no merkel , you and whoever supported your politics have to deal with it . 
  i wo n't be in the way to stop you and i hope they succeed but that is all i 'll ever do and if they fail it 'll be on them and not on me . 
  and every country with a big number of muslims is a target that 's also why countries like poland that supported the iraq war have n't been targeted yet while germany that tried to avoid it became a prime target itself . 
  most of the attacks were commited by children or grandchildren of people that should either have been integrated properly back in the days or should have left europe after their job here was done . 
  by now their numbers in the cities are large enough that integration got harder again . 
  of course terrorism is nothing new for europe but with unchecked immigration we 're just ensuring that terrorism in europe is here to stay for our lifetimes and beyond . 
  but part of the blame is on people like merkel that are allowing millions of people unchecked into europe . 
  of course security and privacy is gon na suffer from that but the blame is on the terrorist ** and ** the politicians enabling their actions . 
  you ca n't have safety and privacy in a europe that is open for everyone . 
  i think it 's fitting . 
  but i hate her so i 'm biased in this regard . 
  is n't that a group of horny older women hunting younger men ? 
  we ca n't even let africa have that one thing : s, 
  it was the same under obama or under bush and iraq . 
  and all of their allies from back then do n't want to take these musels now either ( understandably , but as a german it 's frustrating that we have to deal with the aftermath of the mistakes usa , gb , poland and some other european countries made in that godforsaken shithole that is the middle east ), 
  she even embraces it . 
  remember when she recently spoke about how her oath applies to everyone in germany when she changed the term volk to apply for basically everyone in the world ?
