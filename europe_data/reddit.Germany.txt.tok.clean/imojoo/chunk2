  thanks . 
  what is ` mfa ' ? 
  clothes for `` medical '' jobs ? 
  no , i disagree . 
  they are in fact paid too much and they are not working efficiently , which is not really their fault . 
  first of all you are right , the public expenditure is pretty much on par with many european countries ( ~ 44 % of gdp ) . 
  the graphs you are referencing are indeed very interesting , but i do n't think they support your claim . 
  while the public sector wage bill is about 25 % of the public expenditure , the percentage of the labour force is only 10 % . 
  in the percentage of the labour force is higher . 
  if you read further , page 14 of the paper , there is a table showing the accumulated growth rates of public and private sector wages . 
  greece is on top with ireland for the public services wage growth with above 100 % . 
  in both countries private sector wages grew only about 60 % in most other european countries the growth of the sectors seem to be on par . 
  in section 4 the effects of the public sector on competitiveness is examined . 
  that is were it starts to look grim for greece . 
  this has been on virtually every news site . 
  so technically it is no repost . 
  how are they irrelevant ? 
  how exactly can you see anything like failure in their politics ? 
  all below 60 % debts-to-gdp - where is the failure ? 
  [ cnn-european countries depth-to-gdp ratio ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2011/business/06/19/europe.debt.explainer/index.html ) in about 10 years increasing from 25 % of ** average ** european income to 65 % ? 
  where is the failure in that ? 
  [ wikipedia-baltic tigers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_tiger ) and then comes the crisis . 
  what did you expect to happen ? 
  edit : might have to [ reassess ] ( http://www.balticbusinessnews.com/?publicationid=ab56e32a-3ff3-4c5e-ab8f-d6c2d6fa0a6c ) my view on this miracle . 
  does n't add up for me . 
  leaving out the years prior to 2008 as if they were irrelevant is kind of suspicious , do n't you think ? 
  [ some data ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:real_gdp_growth_in_lithuania.jpg ) [ and more data ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ee_real_gdp_growth-2.svg ) looking at those nice pictures i do n't see any problem for lithuania or estonia to have a budget deficit of 4-5 % . 
  with the current crisis they should n't have a hard time to explain even 10 % . 
  tell me if i am wrong , but i thought the idea was to give every member state the opportunity to get debts up to 40 or 60 % of the nations gdp with joint liability . 
  let me try to get this right , as i am still convinced , that eurobonds would take away the motivation to lower the debts . 
  if there were eurobonds , the interest rates for those would not depend on the performance of an individual member state . 
  the interest rates of highly indebted nations would decrease . 
  these nations would then be able to borrow more money either through their own bonds or eurobonds . 
  what prevents those countries from spending this money again , as they did with the money borrowed after they joined the $ - zone ? 
  if , for example italy , currently paying ~ 7 % interests on their bonds , gets back down to interest rates of 4-5 % , as they were before the crisis , then there is no incentive to do harsh , but necessary reforms . 
  eurobonds even take the direct accountability from governments . 
  if they screw up , not only would they be bankrupt but all the other euro countries would have to pay a part of their debts , and if they do the best job imaginable the interest rate still depends on the other euro member states . 
  that would be the old eurobond plan with another name put on it . 
  we have had several discussions on / r/europe if this plan is feasible , legal and any good at all . 
  have some arguments against it : * takes to long and requires approval of all member states . 
  * takes away motivation to improve public finances from countries with high debts * would violate treaties that are in effect . 
  source ? 
  please adhere to the metric system !, 
  we are germans after all !, 
  source of these statistics ? 
  please , be aware , that there are actually speed limits on many german roads !, 
   couchsurfing is probably a good opportunity to find a bed in towns , but i do n't know how widespread it is in general . 
  there are a lot of hotels , but they are of course more expensive . 
  an inexpensive alternative , about 10-15 $ a night , would be youth hostels ( http://www.jugendherberge.de/en/ ) . 
  i hate camping . 
  so do n't do it . 
  there are official locations like camping-sites , use those if you really have to . 
  if you want to camp ` in the wilderness ' , do n't !, 
  it is illegal in most states of germany . 
  if you just put up a tent somewhere , the owner of the land could even press criminal charges against you , if he did n't approve it . 
  since camping is already lame , why take these extra risks ? 
  good luck on your journey . 
  why is there no bearded vulture in this picture ? 
  cuteness and eu-nationalism doens ' t work . 
  well i do n't know any good books that might help you , but maybe this ? 
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190697/ might be hard to get your hands on that , though . 
  edit : is this a school or university course ? 
  i do n't think the banks really need greece to stay in the $ - zone . 
  just remember there already was one cut . 
  and then the new loans , probably are n't considered safer than the old ones . 
  so i guess most banks have written these bonds off anyway . 
  the banks in greece are in far greater trouble . 
  when you talk about getting the greek economy back on track most of you forget a tiny little details . 
  just set the deficit and the debts of the government aside for one moment and think about the private sector . 
  greece has had a negative foreign trade balance , for years . 
  these excessive imports are sucking the country dry . 
  so throwing more money at the greek people will probably account for nothing good . 
  the money will just flow back within some time . 
  that is why greece leaving the $ - zone has such beauty , even with all the risks attached . 
  they would devalue their new currency . 
  greek exports would regain their competitiveness and imports would become so much more expensive . 
  so lets combine both problems again . 
  so we get high debt , a high deficit and negative foreign trade balance what would another bailout achieve ? 
  it would neither lower their debts , nor set their foreign trade balance straight , nor would it lower the greek unemployment rate , etc. 
  plus the risks that you would have to face if greece would quit the $ are essentially the same . 
  plus the moral issue mentioned in the video . 
  some more locations worth your time in germany : * munich ( just dont do the usual tourist tour , like marketplace to see these puppets at 12am + do n't visit the hofbr\u00e4uhaus , it is just ridiculous + no beer diploma !!! ), 
  * dresden ( really nice , i recommend visiting in the winter , really beautiful and cold then . ), 
  * if you visit the rhine-valley you could make a stop in the vicinity of verdun ( kind of depressing , but i found it a good experience ( this is a wwi battlefield for those of you who did n't know . ) ), 
  * lake of constance ( not such a good location by itself , but the surrounding is supposed to be very nice on a motorcycle , visit the `` flower island '' mainau for example , might seem lame before you were there . ), 
  * heidelberg ( if you are in southern germany already you could take a stroll there , although not that special in my opinion . 
  wait , i mean ohhhh yeaahhhh there is a castle !! ), 
  * trier / treves ( old roman city , birthplace of karl-marx + a lot of other stuff to see ) * n\u00fcrburgring ( drive one lap on the `` hardest '' racetrack in the world . 
  and/or learn to hate the weather in the eifel . 
  dont visit it in winter . ), 
  just looked it up on yt . 
  the performance and the song combined are just terrifying . 
  understanding the lyrics is , as you said , no advantage at all in this special case . 
  but honestly , why send those guys ? 
  do n't you have a voting system like in germany to determine the representative ? 
  if yes , what were the alternatives ?? 
  there was no such threat from germany !, 
  and for france it was sarkozy , trying to impress right-wing voters , which obviously failed . 
  i honestly dont get your point . 
  in several statements you are trying to convince us that more and more people are voting for conservative or right-wing parties , which oppose immigration .
