thanks , that explains what the lazy journalist at the independent did n't bother to . 
   a recent gallup poll revealed 76 per cent of danes supported a ban on the legality of animal sex . 
  why do 24 % of danes * not * support banning animal rape ? 
  is it a `` legislating morality '' thing ? 
   food and accommodation are generally much cheaper in berlin . 
  i 've traveled to each city a lot as both a tourist and as a business traveler , and in my experiences , the food and hotel costs tend to be pretty much equal . 
  a day ticket with bvg costs something like a euro more than with mvv , and from there it would only take fifty cents here and there for munich to come out so very slightly cheaper for your average tourist . 
  munich is obviously much more expensive to * live in * , but that has nothing to do with this study . 
  it makes sense to me , based on their methodology . 
  museums in berlin are not cheaper than ones in munich , nor are things that tourists might need to buy or restaurants . 
  $ 6 cheaper for a day trip to munich does n't surprise me at all . 
  if ireland implemented the eu directives correctly , [ they are able to ] ( https://eumovement.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/refusals-pp-ps-and-ph/ ) . 
  perhaps the gardai in this case need to be retrained , or need better guidelines . 
  and how does he have the money to pay for all of these plane flights ? 
  [ iceland airwaves ] ( http://icelandairwaves.is/ ) is in november . 
  i do n't know if that 's quite what you 're looking for , though . 
  according to the link , there are at least 9 different categories that someone with a us high school diploma would fit into , depending on what other tests ( ap ? 
  act ? 
  i do n't know what those are but you probably do ) they 've passed . 
  but i meant that every other country in europe probably has a similar * database system * , which matches foreign qualifications to the local ones . 
  in germany , there 's a [ database of foreign certificates/diplomas and their german equivalents ] ( http://anabin.kmk.org/anabin-datenbank.html ) . 
  i 'm sure every other country has a similar system . 
  afaik , when a drag queen ( or king ) is performing , it 's common to refer to them as with the appropriate gender for their character . 
  when they are n't in character , then you use the gender that they identify as . 
   germany somehow manages to have nationalised healthcare germany does n't have nationalised healthcare at all . 
  the party 's name is `` the biblical [ maybe fundamentalist would be a better translation ? ], 
  christian party '' . 
  # 1 says `` hands away from the occult - satanism , fortune telling , horoscopes , witchcraft , magic , esoterism - whoever does these things are an abomination to the lord '' # 2 , the first one - `` godless nazis , godless communism , godless eu constitution . 
  not again ! '', 
  and the second `` we do n't want a european dictatorship , but rather a referrendum on the eu constitution '' they 're from a weird minor political party that also gave us [ this wonderful campaign poster ] ( http://www.theologiestudierende.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/pbc_450.jpg ) . 
  the pbc are i think the only ones in germany who ever put up ads similar to the op 's link . 
  [ example 1 ] ( http://www.gott-ist-gut.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/okkultismus.jpg ) [ example2 ] ( http://www.pi-news.net/wp/uploads/2009/04/pbc1.jpg ) but not close to being as extreme . 
  why did they not simply move to the non-occupied part of ukraine , where they clearly would not be facing persecution for supporting the ukraine military ? 
  i ca n't help but assume that they just want 6 months of free food and housing in poland . 
   why does n't germany propose a european union-wide `` no spy '' pact instead ? 
  that 's exactly what germany has proposed and britain is opposed to , as the linked article clearly says . 
  why link to a machine translation when you can [ link to the source itself ] ( http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results ) ? 
  * the child is pointing at me . 
  he must have seen me set the fires * , gilles thought . 
  he stopped his long march with the refugees for a moment to reassure himself that his rifle 's bayonet was as sharp as it was earlier in the morning . 
  * his mother saw nothing , but all the same , i must stab them both and throw them in the flames . 
  only then may i continue my work * . 
  the joke is about stereotypes . 
  the stereotype being that all germans are nazis , so you of course would not want to encounter them as police . 
  but in reality , german police are often very nice . 
  if you enjoy bicycling and enjoy seeing countryside , then yes , it 's possible to [ cross europe ] ( http://www.biroto.eu/tro1.php?route=rt00000447 ) within three months at a leisurely 100km per day on a bicycle . 
  or you could go from london - amsterdam - berlin in just a few weeks if you are n't trying to bike * across * europe . 
  that would also give you plenty of time to see the cities themselves . 
  however , if you 've never gone on a long distance tour before ( or worse , do n't ride regularly at home ) , you should plan to combine the cycling with rail travel initially . 
   `` we are doing everything , both the organizers and our athletes and fans , so that participants and guests feel comfortable in sochi , regardless of nationality , race or sexual orientation , '' putin said , according to ria novosti . 
  `` but when the olympics are over , then they need to leave , '' he added . 
  none . 
  [ this is exactly what would happen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qbqcyrt.png ), 
  from wikipedia :  san marino has a population of approximately 33,000 , with 4,800 foreign residents , most of whom are italian citizens . 
  another 12,000 sammarinese live abroad ( 5,700 in italy , 3,000 in the usa , 1,900 in france and 1,600 in argentina ) if san marino allows people living elsewhere to remain registered to vote , that would explain the difference in numbers . 
  why there are 1600 sammarinese living in argentina , of all places , is a bigger mystery , imo . 
  there are . 
  the munich police [ publish their arrest logs ] ( http://www.polizei.bayern.de/muenchen/news/presse/faelle/index.html/186094 ) during oktoberfest , and there are plenty of thieves that are arrested . 
  meaning there are many more who are n't - most of the time , the thieves are caught because another visitor saw what happened . 
  that might be , but the last time was in july , and it was definitely just a passport/ausweis check . 
  i was on a deutsche bahn bus and the police did n't even ask to open the luggage part of the bus , they just went through looking at identification and then doing i do n't know what for the hour when the two people without id were taken taken off the bus . 
  my point is that the op could probably get away with it , but if he or she is unlucky and is stopped , he or she might not have a good time . 
  i 've been checked a few times on the czech/german border , by german police . 
  the last time , my bus had to stay there for an hour because two idiots did n't have valid identification . 
  you probably wo n't be checked , but if you * are * , you might find yourself in some trouble . 
   `` according to the european regulation , those using a computer should take a 15-minute break every two hours , '' the general secretary ermolaos kasses said . 
  `` it is not easy to have all those breaks during the day , so it was decided back then that it should be given as a day off every two months . '', 
  was he actually able to say that without laughing ? 
  that 's an impressive ability to keep a straight face . 
  i think it has only been a few months since people on / r/europe can choose the franconian flag instead of the bavarian flag . 
  quality journalism from the local , as usual . 
  it does n't even answer the first question that comes to a reader 's mind - * why were shorts banned to begin with ? 
  nuremberg , germany :  cars that do n't give you priority when you have it ... and this is probably universal , so when i think of a bike friendly town , i 'm thinking on exclusive bike lanes or streets . 
  there are lots and lots of separate bike paths , but even when you ride on roads without bike lanes , people are * usually * good about giving you enough room to not feel in danger . 
  there are exceptions , of course . 
   how much time do you spend to find where to tie you bike when you actually get to your destination ? 
  a minute or two . 
   do you feel sure you 'll find it again 8 hours after ? 
  yes . 
  there are only an average of 7 bike thefts reported to the police per day , so i feel fairly confident that mine will not be one of them . 
   can you easily find a shop where to repair/maintain your bike without paying once more its value for tweaking it ? 
  do you have a `` do it yourself '' repair shop nearby ? 
  i have my own `` workshop '' and fix everything myself , but if i needed someone else to do something , there are plenty of good places . 
  i do n't know of a diy place , though . 
  that would be really nice to have . 
   could everybody at your workplace come by bike ( and public transportation ) , excepting those that physically ca n't ? 
  yes , and in summer , many do . 
  i much prefer that to cycle paths on the street , although pedestrians can be just as inattentive and nearly as dangerous as auto drivers . 
   can you easily rent a bike for the day/week and at a reasonable price ( unlike all rentals in paris ) ? 
  i think when i 've rented bikes for visitors , it was $ 15 per day or so from both places i 've rented from . 
  i do n't know if you think that 's a reasonable price or not , but i find it perfectly in order . 
   do you have a bike sharing program ( like velib ) that covers a lot of ground ( unlike velib ) ? 
  yes , and they have [ fairly good coverage ] ( https://www.norisbike.de/de/nuernberg/standorte/ ) . 
  i 've never ridden one , but they seem well maintained . 
  it was actually anglicism of the year in [ 2011 ] ( http://www.anglizismusdesjahres.de/anglizismen-des-jahres/adj-2011/ ) . 
  i do n't understand why it would be newsworthy at this point . 
  edit : or at any point . 
  it 's an irritating word . 
  the question is actually :  have you ever been or are you now involved in espionage or sabotage ; or in terrorist activities ; or genocide ; or between 1933 and 1945 were you involved , in any way , in persecutions associated with nazi germany or its allies ? 
  i 've always assumed it 's to make it easier for the government to deport people - if a non-american is convicted of supporting terrorists or something , they can deport the person for having lied on the form without any other legal reasons .
