  the nazi part is probably to make it easier to extradite former nazis to countries that want to prosecute them , because , again , they lied on the form . 
  if you were not involved with nazis persecutions between 1933 and 1945 , you have nothing to worry about :-) you 'll still have to pay $ 14 to fill out the stupid form , though . 
  the problem is that he * is n't * apple or samsung , so ( if he were in the us ) , he would be [ more likely to be sued than they are ] ( http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/blog/2012/09/small-business-pain-from-patent-trolls.html?page=all ) . 
  software patents are stupid and broken , in my humble * software-engineer-whose-employer-filed-a-patent-on-his-software * opinion . 
  bu\u00df und bettag is a legal holiday only in sachsen . 
  maybe you 're thinking of mari\u00e4 himmelfahrt , which is a holiday only in saarland and the catholic-majority parts of bavaria . 
  i assume in other countries you have to be a citizen , but in germany it seems that all any random non-citizen needs to do is declare themselves `` self-employed '' and then deal with the bureaucracy around getting onto algii . 
  if i read this correctly , you 're hoping to visit london , paris , amsterdam , frankfurt , berlin , vienna , somewhere in switzerland , and prague ... all in 16 days ? 
  i suppose it can be done , but you 'll see more of the insides of rail carriages , airplane cabins , and hotel rooms than you will of the cities you visit . 
  you should trim this list down to get anything out of your trip . 
  i understand your motivation - australia is really far away and one hell of a long journey - but trying to cover most of the width of europe in two or even three weeks is n't a good idea . 
  i mean , london * alone * could occupy a week of your trip and still leave you feeling like you did n't have time to see it properly . 
  here are a few itinerary suggestions that are more reasonable . 
  adjust as necessary : 1 ) first suggestion : * fly into heathrow with an [ open-jaw ticket ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open-jaw_ticket ) * the underground journey into london itself is a hellish 1 + hours , but only costs # 6 or so . 
  * 4 days in london . 
  you should plan to spend at least one of those days in the unbelievably massive [ british museum ] ( http://www.britishmuseum.org/ ) . 
  i 'm not joking - you really can spend an entire day there . 
  * [ train ] ( http://www.eurostar.com/ ) to paris . 
  book in advance , if possible . 
  * 4 days in paris . 
  do n't feel bad - the french are assholes to everyone , they 're not targeting you specifically . 
  * take an early [ train to amsterdam ] ( http://www.thalys.com/ ) . 
  spend 4 days there , three in amsterdam itself , one in a nicer , smaller dutch city like maastricht or leiden . 
  * what is the red light district really like ? 
  it 's full of drunken louts on stag parties chanting about football and a depressing number of women who have been forcibly trafficked into the sex industry . 
  not my idea of a good time , but i suppose it 's worth seeing from the fringes . 
  * mind the cyclists in amsterdam - they seem to suddenly come out of nowhere . 
  and feel free to outright ignore the four thousand junkies who will be demanding money as you walk around . 
  * overnight train to berlin . 
  you might be able to book in advance with [ deutsche bahn ] ( http://www.bahn.de/i/view/gbr/en/index.shtml ) . 
  * 4 days in berlin . 
  fly out of berlin back to australia . 
  2 ) second suggestion : * fly to berlin , again open-jaw . 
  4 days there . 
  * train to munich on the ice . 
  book well in advance with deutsche bahn . 
  * spend at least 2 or 3 days in munich , including a visit to the [ deutsches museum ] ( http://www.deutsches-museum.de/index.php?id=1&amp;l=1 ) * trains to zurich . 
  afaik , there is no direct train there , i 've always transfered to an intercity in stuttgart . 
  * you will see the alps . 
  yes , they are incredible . 
  * zurich itself is n't very interesting , but there are plenty of trains to take you into other parts of the country . 
  depending on when you go , and whether or not you enjoy opera , the [ opera on the lake ] ( http://www.bregenzerfestspiele.com/en/mainmenu/programme/opera-lake/preface ) in bregenz would be worth a trip . 
  * from zurich , you can take a train to vienna on the inappropriately named railjet ( it is not as fast as you would think with such a name !, 
  ) , but you 'd probably be better off flying given how long it takes . 
  * alternative : if you 're not a big outdoors person , you can take a train from munich to vienna instead of going to zurich . 
  while you are in munich , satisfy your craving for the alps by taking a day trip to [ mittenwald ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mittenwald ) * 4 days in vienna . 
  it 's expensive , and try to plan it so you are n't there on a sunday - everything is closed , and the cafes are packed to the rafters . 
  think about including a day trip to bratislava , slovakia , which is only an hour away . 
  * train to prague . 
  4 days there . 
  think about visiting the [ sedlec ossuary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sedlec_ossuary ) , which is a total tourist trap , but you can walk away with a photo of yourself standing in front of a pile of skulls which is pretty cool . 
  * fly out of prague , probably via frankfurt . 
  my point is - do n't try to do too much . 
  you 're young , and europe will be around for you to come back to in the future , so take the time to enjoy where you go . 
  feel free to pm me if you have questions . 
  like nearly everyone in germany , i always round up to the next euro so i do n't have to get the small change back , and then i usually add $ 1 if the waiter or taxi driver was n't a complete asshole . 
  but i always tip delivery people three euros because i feel guilty about being too lazy to pick up my own food and sometimes they 're older people and i feel bad for them . 
  i once gave a taxi driver a $ 5 tip because he politely ignored the uncomfortably loud sounds of the woman i was with vomiting in her handbag after drinking too much . 
  a true professional , he was . 
  you have never been on a train in the uk , or known someone who has been on a train in the uk , or seen a youtube video of someone who has been on a train in the uk , or read anything written by anyone about their experience being on a train in the uk , or a have a cousin who has an ex-girlfriend who has an uncle who has a friend who has been on a train in the uk , have you ? 
  it 's ok , there are no stupid questions , but you might be surprised at just how much worse than db it can be , really . 
  is there a picture of the diploma online ? 
  i would vote for a [ european cave lion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panthera_leo_spelaea ) for the $ 5 , a [ european otter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_otter ) for the $ 10 , a [ brown bear ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown_bear ) for the $ 20 and a [ eurasian lynx ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_lynx ) for the $ 50 , a [ golden eagle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_eagle ) for the $ 100 , a [ red fox ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_fox ) for the $ 200 , and a [ eurasian wolf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_wolf ) for the $ 500 . 
  because animals are a lot cooler than bridges , all of those animals roamed ( or currently roam ) over large parts of europe , and some of them , like the eagle , lion and wolf , are parts of in national symbols in different countries . 
  you have several common options : * yes this helps a lot . 
  thank you !, 
  ** / s ** * yes this ** '' ** helps ** '' ** a lot . 
  thank you !, 
  * ** & lt ; sarcasm & gt ; ** yes , this helps a lot . 
  thank you !, 
  ** & lt ; / sarcasm & gt ; ** some people use * ** -_- ** or ** (  . < ) ** to indicate sarcasm but afaik that is n't universal . 
  i suggest using the ** / s ** next time . 
  i am not from monaco , but i have visited many times . 
  most people live in single-family homes , no more than two stories tall , usually with a jacuzzi in their spacious backyards . 
  monaco has a lot of available housing , so the government allocates it based on first-come/first-served . 
  generally , if someone is on welfare , they can expect to receive 100m ^ 2 if they are single , and 25 ^ 2 for each additional family member . 
  monaco is very wealthy and generous . 
  housing prices are fairly cheap in monaco - one would expect to pay no more than $ 200.000 for a three bedroom house near the beach . 
  there are many neighborhoods in monaco , such as fontvieille , la condamine and the b\u00e2tard paresseux . 
  i hope this helps with your homework assignment . 
  it seems like every week i 'm given one more reason to be grateful that i was a teenager before the internet became widely used . 
  this novelty account has potential , please do n't waste it . 
  of course they do , in [ many countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identity_document#european_union ) . 
  notice how many entries mention being required to produce id for the police when asked . 
  i 've personally been checked in germany and the netherlands , and seen it happen in france and italy . 
  yes , you will need to have your passport with you in order to board an airplane , if nothing else . 
  why have you not called the american embassy ? 
  their job is to answer questions like this , and they can additionally tell you what your options are ( perhaps a temporary travel document ? ), 
  not at all , they 're very popular with teenagers in many countries . 
  they are n't * important * - no one cares what a tourist wears . 
  but the op wants to look like a local , and running shoes would make them immediately stand out . 
  * i know they all speak ess-pan-yol in portugal . 
  this guy must be deaf , i better shout louder *, 
  i do n't think you have the american accent right * dohn-day est-ah el bath-a-room-o *, 
  * use an `` indoor voice '' when you are indoors , do not shout * allow people to speak in turn instead of shouting at them because you assume that your opinions are the only ones that matter * do not turn every single conversation into shouting about `` how things are done in america '' , that gets old very quickly * running shoes are for running , and wearing running shoes when you are not running is the same as walking around with a sign that says `` i am almost certainly an american and i will shout at you about boring things '' * beer will be better than what you are accustomed to , and you will probably drink a lot of it so be careful and do n't use being drunk as an excuse to shout about boring things * if you shout `` oh my gaaahhwwwwd , that building is , like , totally older than america , right ? '', 
  you will cause a very cute puppy to die and its blood will be on your hands edit : to be specific , [ these ] ( http://www.runtheline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/asics-running-shoes1.jpg ) are what i mean by running shoes . 
  other types of casual shoes do not stand out . 
  edit # 2 : americans , you can stop telling me how great your beer is , i 've drunk many american microbrews myself , and they are n't bad . 
  however , the op is a * university student * . 
  the chances are , that he or she is not accustomed to drinking expensive microbrews , and so my beer comparison is between cheap beers of the world .
