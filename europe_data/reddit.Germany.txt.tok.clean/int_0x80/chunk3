  it is . 
  their print magazines have had a [ unique ] ( http://www.coverjunkie.com/magazines/139 ) [ design language ] ( http://gizmodo.com/how-businessweek-is-reinventing-the-magazine-cover-1654491155 ) , unique for a business-oriented magazine at least , for the last few years . 
  they extended that to their web design in january , but the guy responsible for it was [ recently fired ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/07/10/top-digital-editor-joshua-topolsky-is-out-at-bloomberg/ ) and they 'll be reportedly going back to a more traditional web design . 
  so enjoy their very weird [ 404 error page ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/404 ) and [ 500 error page ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/500 ) while you can . 
   i would really question the source of ops picture it seems to have originated [ here ] ( http://skanepaug.blogspot.se/2014/09/sd-och-extremismens-anti-ukraina-allians.html ) , at least , that 's all that google reverse image search comes up with . 
   always wanted to use ? 
  and !, 
  at the same time it 's called an [ interrobang ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interrobang ) and thanks to the glories of unicode , you really can use ?

  israel is very close with [ micronesia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel%e2%80%93federated_states_of_micronesia_relations ) , [ palau ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel%e2%80%93palau_relations ) and nauru on their own . 
  but why is this considered bad ? 
  i save a part of my salary every month ( in a low-interest savings account , of course ) because i already have all of the things i 've decided i need to have a comfortable life . 
  why good would it do me to spend it on new things ? 
  also , in order to buy a house here , one must have a large amount of money saved up in order to get a mortgage , so perhaps that is another cultural difference that the us treasury does n't understand . 
   also , cheap airline companies would lose a lot of money if they had to retreat from serbia . 
  i 'm willing to bet that this money is greater than that given to a few thousand fake asylum seekers . 
  it 's a bit more than a few thousand - there have been more than 7000 claims from serbians and macedonians in germany alone this year . 
  and each one of those needs to be processed , despite that fact that something like 90 % of them are denied ( and the asylum seekers know that their claim will be denied ) , meaning that it takes effort and money away from people legitimately seeking asylum . 
  but i agree that it 's unfair to punish the 99.999 % of other serbians and macedonians by changing the visa laws . 
  a better solution would be to figure out how to make asylum seeking less attractive to people abusing the system . 
  [ memorial to homosexuals persecuted under nazism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memorial_to_homosexuals_persecuted_under_nazism ) [ memorial to those who lost their lives to the nazi t4 `` euthanasia '' program ] ( http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/photos/junct/junct.htm ) etc. 
  germany is not lacking in holocaust memorials . 
   not sure what anyone would find annoying about that seeing as they dont even have to click on the advert but this is something a search engine spammer could also easily say . 
  `` well i do n't know why anyone searching for widgets would have a problem seeing results for gadgets . 
  they do n't even have to click on the link ! '', 
  the fact is , the majority of experienced developers looking for a job in a specific location are * not * going to be interested in relocating for various reasons . 
  by filling up their search results for jobs in london with jobs that they have no use in seeing from the very start , you make their day more frustrating , and you reduce the utility of whatever platform you 're advertising your job on . 
  and since your company is definitely not the only one looking for new people and willing to pay for relocation , that bait-and-switch tactic gets * very * frustrating as it turns from a trickle into a flood . 
  if i knew what you were specifically looking for in a candidate , i could probably offer much better options than the job listing version of meta tag stuffing . 
   then might put location as london ( or other ) but have amsterdam in the title of the job just so we get more eyes on please do n't do this , it 's deeply , * deeply * annoying . 
  if you 're offering relocation , say so . 
  if you 're offering telecommute options , say so . 
  do n't bait and switch , even if you 're clear about it in the title - it 's still one more obnoxious bit of useless garbage out of so much to sift through and jobsearchers already waste so much time on that . 
  if you are n't already doing this , ask your existing developers to post the ad on their social networks making it clear that relocation is offered , or to recommend people . 
  if you do n't have a recruitment bonus scheme for employees in place , you should create one . 
  i would like to see [careers.stackoverflow.com ] ( http://careers.stackoverflow.com ) used by more employers , personally . 
  monster is awful and full of sleazy recruiters . 
  it 's [ a very common thing for countries to offer ] ( http://www.second-citizenship.org/permanent-residence/investment-programs-in-comparison/ ) . 
  but it is worth noting that permanent residency is * not * citizenship . 
  if it were coming from bild , i would assume that it 's at least partially invented , but faz is a respectable enough newspaper . 
  if they build houseboats , they can live on the river of tears that i am crying for them . 
  i ca n't speak for other countries , but in germany , people get them from clothing stores . 
  germany used to have a central distribution network funded by the government ( everyone was entitled to two pairs per year ) , but after eu directive 482/2004 privatized a number of services across europe , that network is now in the hands of the so called * caprihosekartell * . 
  they set the prices and where on the calf the trousers that are not trousers reach . 
  in 2009 there were riots when the cartel announced that the capri leg would now be 5mm longer , as they were under pressure from conservative militants who ( rightfully , imo ) believe that trousers should be trousers and shorts should be shorts and meeting in the middle does n't make any sense at all . 
  it is not all sadness for caprifans , though - there is pending legislation in european parliament to allow governments to , once more , distribute these fashion abominations to their misguided citizens . 
  that wo n't really help an american , but perhaps you can go on holiday and ask a citizen to give you their capri ration . 
  i was n't making a joke - i 've only ever heard of `` the french disease '' in the context of referring to syphilis . 
  i 'm curious - what sources explain it being used to refer to homosexuality ? 
   for example , in the uk it was often called `` the french disease , '' you seem to be confusing syphilis with homosexuality . 
  this does not sound like a good start for your research . 
   croatia joins the eu in less than a year they do , but i do n't really trust an unverified , now deleted iama post to inform me at all about what that means ... 
  if you want to make fun of the french , make fun of the fact that they * can not brew beer * can not make pizza both of which are very simple to do , and yet france can not do either . 
  but making fun of them for their `` wimpiness '' ? 
  that 's just lazy and historically incorrect . 
  the german one sounds weird , but since no one has ever actually said a sentence like this in the entire history of the german language , i think heineken can be excused for their weird sounding translation . 
  artistic license , one might say . 
  edit : and the advertisement is from heineken usa so < insert joke about what you call a person who speaks only one language here  . 
  the google translation of this article is terrible , so i 'm curious : a ) this article seems to be talking about the time spent physically in the classroom , so how long are the school days ( meaning , what is the typical schedule for a primary school student ) ? 
  b ) what is the amount of time teachers spend working outside of the classroom like reviewing students ' work or preparing the next week 's lesson ? 
  is that time paid for , or not ( like in the usa ) ? 
  yes , but only if it were freistaat bayern-franken . 
  jill stein for me as well . 
  i 've never heard of her , and i doubt she 'll even get more than a handful of votes , but i wish her luck in her quixotic quest against the wealthy corporations that own america . 
  ** the sky is falling ** ** everyone panic **, 
  whatever route you plan , make sure to read the rental agreement carefully . 
  they usually forbid taking the car into certain countries , with the insurance not being valid should you do it anyway . 
  iirc , the sz reported earlier this year that a whole ** 25 % ** of foreign students remain in germany after their studies are completed . 
  the fact that we pay for education of so many people who then do n't stay to contribute back makes no sense at all to me . 
  i have no idea what a `` european style pan '' is , and i 've never heard of these people , but since they do sell in the eu ( under the `` stoneline '' name rather than `` stonedine '' ) , this is n't a lie . 
  all they need is one happy customer in bremen and another in ochsenfurt and then , technically , `` people all over europe '' would be loving their product . 
  january through march is the * worst * time to travel in europe . 
  you 'll get all of the terrible weather without even the slightly nice parts about being able to see the christmas-related celebrations that are everywhere ( or the new years celebrations ) . 
  if you can delay your trip to be from april-june or so , you 'll have a much better time . 
  if you ca n't , though , keep in mind that you 'll have to pack for different climates : cold and snowy in the northern countries , cold and rainy across the central countries , and mild ( or occasionally even slightly warm ) in the southern ones . 
  plan on travel delays in germany , as the weather in those months causes problems with both airplanes and trains . 
  if you 're in england and it snows , do n't even think about trying to take a train anywhere . 
  british rail is allergic to snow . 
  as to where to start - the logical thing to do would be to find a reasonably priced flight to heathrow or schiphol and work your way east from london or amsterdam respectively . 
  you could also fly into cdg , but it 's a very horrible airport . 
  if you fly into frankfurt , you 'll probably want to immediately take a train or connecting flight elsewhere - frankfurt is not a very interesting city , although i guess you could spend a day or two there . 
  i suggest that you plan to spend no * fewer * than 5 days in any of the large cities . 
  you 'll see a lot more , and it gives you more flexibility to go on day trips to surrounding areas . 
  also when you 're planning your trip , remember that traveling from one country to the next can take up an entire day . 
  do n't spend all of your time in the large cities - for a truly `` european experience '' you need to get out and visit other places . 
  for example : * instead of spending a week in london , spend 5 days in london ( one of which should be exclusively devoted to the british museum ) and 5 days in cardiff or something . 
  * instead of a week in amsterdam , spend a few days there and go on some day trips to places like utrecht or leiden * instead of a week in berlin , spend four or five days in hamburg , four or five in berlin , and then a day or two in leipzig on your way south to bavaria , the beautiful , friendly part of germany . 
  also , do n't forget the eastern edges of the eu . 
  krakow is worth a short visit , and prague and budapest are both worth spending several days to explore . 
  slovakia is beautiful and much cheaper than neighboring austria , so you should go through bratislava on your way to vienna , or vice-versa . 
  lithuania and latvia as well , but you should check if you need a russian transit visa if you 're taking a train from poland and it goes through kaliningrad oblast . 
  anyway , a random collection of things : * the alps are full of small , beautiful villages . 
  one of my favorites is [ mittenwald ] ( http://www.brodyaga.com/pages/viewlarge.php?id=7493&amp;cty=mittenwald&amp;place=germany,%2520bayern ) in the bavarian pre-alps . 
  if you are n't a skier , you probably wo n't want to spend more than a night there , but it 's still nice . 
  * lisbon will probably have warmest temperatures of any major city during the time you are in europe . 
  it 's a nice place to spend a few days . 
  likewise , you can also find jeans-and-tshirt weather in parts of spain . 
  * c\u00f4te d'azur might be slightly warm ( like , 20c in nice or something ) but it 's very expensive .
