  monaco is a laugh if you 're in the area , though . 
  * i do n't know what rome is like in january , but i 'd bet it 's more enjoyable weather than in mid-summer , the only times i 've ever visited , when it 's an oven . 
  same for florence . 
  * belgium is very boring , although not as boring as lichtenstein . 
  but you should still spend a few days in brussels . 
  i 'd skip antwerp , though , unless you 're going to brussels by train from amsterdam and need to buy beer along the way . 
  * i 've never understood the appeal of london . 
  the museums are fantastic , but places like manchester and brighton are less stressful . 
  tougher to get to , though , since british rail is horrible . 
  * zurich feels very sterile to me for some reason , geneva is pretty , and the towns around lake constance ( particularly lindau ) have a unique charm to them . 
  * if you 're in vilnius and want to get out of the city , go to [ trakai ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trakai ) . 
  * in the czech republic , places like [ harrachov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harrachov ) are fun in the winter , if you like the outdoors . 
  have fun !, 
  it 's far more than just being '' [ irritating ] ( http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/what-is-street-harassment/why-stopping-street-harassment-matters/ ) '' . 
  `` irritating '' is people who shout into their mobile phones on public transit . 
  calling a woman a whore , or following her down the street trying to get her to go to a hotel room is far more than just irritating , because all of that harassment across the day makes her feel unsafe . 
  [ you can read lots of things about it ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/may/25/four-10-women-sexually-harassed?newsfeed=true ) if you really think it 's just minor irritation that causes no harm . 
  but even if it were illegal , i ca n't imagine that it would stop the kinds of stupid , pathetic men who do it . 
  i did n't find it surprising , but i do find it funny that someone is driving a * porsche * around with the hammer and sickle on it . 
  clueless or ironic , i ca n't decide . 
  2008/2009 was worse for me . 
  my company laid a lot of people off , put hiring and wage freezes in place , and then most of the remaining employees went on [ kurzarbeit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurzarbeit ) for a while . 
  but everything is now back to the way it was before the beginning of the crisis . 
  better , even . 
   still one matter remains , is n't it tough find a job in the eu nowadays ? 
  you have a degree in engineering and you currently speak english and arabic fluently . 
  even though it does n't sound like you have work experience , after you have your masters degree , you are not going to be looking for a job , rather , jobs will be looking for * you * . 
  no , but it would be good if you practiced asking * sprechen sie englisch ? 
  * before speaking english to someone who is n't working at a hotel or restaurant , as a basic bit of politeness . 
  other than that , if you speak english at a reasonable , non-american volume no one will think you 're an annoying tourist . 
  we would more than double their population , and triple the number of regional languages spoken . 
  i ca n't see them being too happy about that . 
  no , we 'll just have to break off from germany and make * freistaat bayern * more than just a motto . 
  the prussians need our beer , our cars , and our pharmaceuticals anyway , so i think we 'd come out ahead in the end . 
  ** bbc editorial meeting , 17.07.2012 ** * editor 1 * : so we need a new piece about this crisis in the eurozone . 
  ideas ? 
  * editor 2 * : how about we talk about greek tax evasion ? 
  * editor 1 * : no , i think we 've done enough of those . 
  how about you , bob , any ideas ? 
  * editor 3 * : maybe talk about how investment banks helped greece lie to the eu about the extent of their problems ? 
  * editor 1 * : are you crazy , man ? 
  if we 're too aggressive about that , the tories will cut our funding entirely . 
  no , we need an entirely new angle . 
  something no one else has done . 
  * chris bowlby * : i was thinking that no one has looked at financial differences between protestant and catholic countries . 
  it 's complete bullshit , but i think i can pull something out of my ass in time for the deadline . 
  i 'll just ignore inconvenient facts and we 'll be all set . 
  * editors 1 , 2 and 3 grin at each other , knowing that their secret plan to drag bbc journalistic standards down to the murdoch level are proceeding nicely *, 
  yes it is , # 24 on the quality of living survey and tied with munich and a few other cities for # 11 on the safety survey . 
  personally , i think it should be higher on the quality of life survey , but it certainly is a very safe place to live . 
   ` i think this might actually be a way of trying to put a stop to the unlimited party possibilities in berlin . 
  it 's very radical , '' dj steffi told pulseradio.net . 
  is it really too late now to move the capital back to bonn and sell berlin to the russians or something ? 
  we 'd all be better off with that arrangement , i think . 
  it seems to be common . 
  an english friend of mine was travelling in the us , and went to a restaurant where the waitress asked him where he was from . 
  he answered `` a small town south of london '' , and the waitress said `` well , you speak very good english for a foreigner ! '', 
  she , too , was shocked when he told her that english is the native language of england . 
  do american states really have different cultures ? 
  i can see the general differences between the west , north east , middle and south , but at the end of the day they still speak the same language , watch the same television shows , mostly eat the same things and watch the same sports . 
  compared to germany , where the north and south ends have radically different dialects and culture , the us seems very uniform . 
  and compared to the differences between , say , poland and portugal , the us does n't even come close . 
  you 're right - it 's eu/eu candidate countries as of 2005 , which is why turkey and croatia are on the graph , but iceland is n't . 
  thank you . 
  i do n't think it answers my question about why they include turkey but not the eea countries or switzerland , but it 's still an interesting report :-), 
  a source would be nice . 
  it might answer such questions as : why does this graph include turkey , but not norway , switzerland , or iceland ? 
  and how do they define `` speaking english '' ? 
   so much of europe has high unemployment , and yet at the same time i 'm reading about poland hiring chinese contractors to build their roads and europe in general importing foreign immigrant labor . 
  poland 's law apparently required the government to hire the cheapest contractor , and they obviously got what they paid for . 
  it 's a stupid law , but i assume that `` save the citizens money '' was what they were trying to achieve with it . 
   why ca n't europeans hire europeans ? 
  labor laws in european countries usually require that . 
  in order to work in most occupations in germany , for example , the employer needs to prove that they have n't been able to find a qualified eu citizen in order for a non-eu national to get a work permit . 
  the government recently changed the law for certain types of jobs , getting rid of that requirement , in order to promote a wage-dumping visa scheme ( the `` blue card '' ) because employers are n't satisfied with the decade of stagnant wages we 've had to put up with , and would rather find even cheaper foreigners . 
  but anyway , looking at the people in the article , it 's difficult to imagine they would have an easier time finding work in a foreign country : * pepe de uriarte , publicist - would a publicist who does n't speak the local language or have contacts in the local media get far in another country ? 
  * pablo vega gonzalez , video-game tester - qa is a difficult job to do well , but it 's still not a high-demand field . 
  he studied labor law and human resources in university , and neither of those are easily portable to non english/spanish speaking countries with different laws . 
  * wendy atkinson navarro , administrative assistant - i do n't think this type of job is in-demand anywhere . 
  i live in an area with 4 % unemployment , and the only administrative assistant i 've known lost her job and it took her nearly a year to find another one . 
  i assume that many unemployed spanish people simply are n't trained in occupations that are easily portable to other countries . 
  and outside of technology work , even the portable skills would require them to learn a new language , which can be quite a barrier . 
  plus , moving can be very expensive and painful , particularly for people with families . 
   so , the city is delaying the project while it looks for an american company to build the trains . 
  i looked on wikipedia , because that did n't sound right to me ( siemens builds their rolling stock in sacramento , ca , which is fully compliant with the law ) , and your city is actually buying [ from a spanish company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metrorail#caf-usa_expansion_order_controversy ) . 
  buying a mobile phone , obviously . 
  i have n't paid much attention to this , but why did n't they just change the law to require coffeeshops to only sell to people with proof of nl residency or citizenship , like a passport , id , or drivers licence ? 
  then locals would n't be pushed to buying from street dealers , because they would n't have to leave a paper trail , and they 'd still cut down on drugs tourism . 
   what do you guys think ? 
  is it true at all ? 
  do you know any people who actually do this kind of thing ? 
  i 'm really certain that this is just an urban myth . 
  remember , the people who came up with the eurozone did n't even create a way for countries to leave in an orderly way , which really should have been an obvious thing to do , so why would they come up with a plan to replace currency based on the serial number should the whole thing fall apart ? 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  also it would mean that those of us outside of spain or portugal would suddenly find that some of our $ 50 notes were worth less than $ 50 ( or 100 marks , for example , if we 're assuming that everyone abandons the currency at once and goes back to what it was before ) . 
  then what would happen ? 
  would we then have to exchange each bill individually for the appropriate foreign currency ? 
  the banks themselves would refuse to play along , since checking the serial number of each euro bill in circulation would be impossible . 
  lesson learnt : read the packaging , and ignore the deceptive marketing :-), 
   question : aldi/hofer beer/wine ... is any of them drinkable ?
