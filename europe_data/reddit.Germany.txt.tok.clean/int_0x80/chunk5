  a general rule is `` avoid beer in plastic bottles '' , but in germany i 've seen bitburger beer in plastic bottles at aldi ( i think . 
  maybe it was lidl ? ), 
  that was drinkable . 
  it was n't great , but it was n't the worst beer i 've had in my life . 
   these patros olive-with-feta-cheese is delicious . 
  we buy them in aldi/hofer in austria . 
  best way of helping them  patros is a german brand operated by a german company , who makes its cheese at several sites in bavaria . 
  afaik , it is n't a greek export at all . 
  edit : i just looked on wikipedia , and with feta being a protected regional title , they must be producing it in greece . 
  but your money still goes to germany :-), 
   1981 : mauritania abolishes slavery '' wow . 
  unbelievable . . 
  even more unbelievably , they did n't make it a crime until ** 2007 ** . 
  and [ it is still widespread there ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2012/03/world/mauritania.slaverys.last.stronghold/index.html ) . 
  montenegro , * of course * . 
  why would anyone * not * want a man called rambo amadeus to win ? 
   i 'd like a newspaper reporting on eu issues . 
  there is [ the parliament ] ( http://www.theparliament.com/ ) , [ new europe ] ( http://www.neurope.eu/ ) , [ european voice ] ( http://www.europeanvoice.com/ ) and when i stayed in a hotel next to the eu complex in brussels , the hotel had copies of [ e | sharp ] ( http://esharp.eu/ ) in all of the rooms . 
  i always find it funny when american colleagues start a conversation with `` hey , how 's it going ? '', 
  and then immediately start talking about something without waiting for me to answer . 
  of course we say `` hello '' and `` goodbye '' to each other , or `` have a nice weekend '' or whatever , but why ask how someone 's day is going if you do n't actually want to know the answer ? 
  it 's just fake friendliness , and every time i go to the us , nearly everyone i encounter in stores asks how i am . 
  young american tourists are more respectful than young british tourists , in my experience . 
  but the older the tourist is , the more likely it is that the brit will be the well-mannered one , and the american will be rude and shouting at everyone and expecting the world to revolve around them . 
   do n't just sit there and smile at me . 
  or ask questions that you do n't want to hear the answer to , like `` how is your day going ? '', 
  answer that question honestly and americans look at you like you 're from another planet . 
  america is already very politically close with one european country , the uk , and has friendly or close relations with most , if not all , of the others . 
  but i do n't see a need to be closer than that . 
  i do n't know what you mean by `` socially '' at all . 
  it 's an excuse to get drunk and watch cheesy , often weird , pop music , what 's not to like about it ? 
  i would n't pay to watch it ( or to vote ) , but after a few beers , it 's good fun . 
  well , we do n't live in a socialist country , to start with . 
  and claiming that we do just makes you sound stupid . 
  if you say stupid things , then people will think that you 're stupid . 
  that 's life , and i 'm sorry that i have to be the one to break that to you . 
  the problem with the internet is , just when you think you 've hit the limits of dumb things , someone comes along to prove you wrong . 
  even though it 's only lunch time , i can safely say that is the dumbest thing i 'll read today , possibly this week . 
  extremely commonplace . 
  they [ found one just a week ago ] ( http://www.br.de/franken/inhalt/aktuelles-aus-franken/fliegerbombe-fuerth-evakuierung100.html ) in a city near me , and last year , [ thousands of people in my city were evacuated ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/nuernberg-fliegerbombe-gefunden-feierabend-auf-dem-feldbett-1.1055225 ) . 
   a look at the issues : * ap then completely ignores the main issue that us airline security is nothing more than security theater that diverts billions of dollars to politically-connected corporations *, 
  the pill is only 97 % or 98 % effective . 
  if a couple really is n't prepared to have a child , they 're much better off using condoms as well . 
  there is no `` best place in europe to live '' . 
  it 's a continent full of diverse countries with diverse societies , governmental models , economic models , weather patterns , climates , and cultural attitudes . 
  there are dumb , crude assholes in all of those countries , and likewise , every country also has wonderful people who will go out of their way to help a stranger . 
  the only uniting factors are that all of these diverse places are crammed into 10 million square kilometers , most of our countries belong to the eu , and we all watch eurovision whether we want to or not . 
  the `` best place '' for one person to live will not be the same `` best place '' for another person , and the internet can not tell you if a place will continue to be the paradise you imagined once you live through four seasons , an asshole boss at work , and the daily tedium of life . 
  take some long holidays to different countries , stay in holiday flats ( airbnb is good for this ) , and you 'll see what i mean . 
  bratislava is 4 hours away by train , and i enjoyed my visit there . 
  if budapest is n't too far , that 's another great city to visit . 
  but why are you trying to stuff another city into your itinerary ? 
  3 weeks is enough time to properly explore 3 of the cities you 're going to ( pick any 3 , they 're all quite large ) , but 5 cities in 3 weeks ? 
  you 'll spend more time in transit than enjoying your destinations . 
  for biking and hiking , southern germany is heaven ( although i will admit that i am biased ) . 
  if you have a few days for an adventure , i suggest : * go to munich . 
  book a hotel for a night , and also for a night a few days later . 
  find one that will allow you to leave your luggage there . 
  * rent bicycles . 
  put a few days clothing and a few litres of water in your backpacks . 
  * take the train to [ mittenwald ] ( http://www.alpenwelt-karwendel.de/mittenwald ) on the foothills of the alps . 
  the train is a direct regional train , and will take two hours . 
  * from mittenwald , ride north along the [ isar bike route ] ( http://87.234.63.51/bfr/rw/rw_33.htm ) which mostly follows along the [ isar river ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isar ) . 
  * overnight in bad t\u00f6lz ( about 60km from mittenwald ) * continue along the isar another 60km back to munich . 
  it 's not a difficult ride ( it 's mostly downhill ) , but it is one of the [ most beautiful routes in germany ] ( http://www.fahrrad-tour.de/isarradweg/isar1.htm#mittenwald ) in my opinion . 
  and since it 's a popular route , the signs are easy to follow so you do n't get lost . 
  also , there are 8,000 km of official bike routes in bavaria , so even if you do n't want to go on an overnight trip , you can really pick any city and have plenty of choices for day trips . 
  regional trains usually have bicycle carriages , so getting back to where you started from is never an issue . 
  feel free to pm me if you decide to put bavaria in your plans , i can probably give better advice with specific details :-), 
  you should n't be worried . 
  i 've traveled around half of the countries in the eu , and even when i was in remote parts of poland and slovakia , where no one spoke english or german , they did n't treat me like an idiot . 
  i think the french are different in that way from the rest of the continent , probably because of how important their language used to be . 
  from the other perspective , as someone you might encounter in a non-english speaking country : just be polite and nice about not speaking the local language . 
  if you do n't come up to me shouting slowly in english * where ... is ... 
  the ... 
  train ... station * or something equally as rude , i 'll go out of my way to help , and that can be said for nearly all of people you 'd talk to in every country you visit . 
  people are nicer than you might think !, 
  it looks like the `` european jewish parliament '' is completely unaffiliated with the eu , receiving no funding from the eu , and just holding a meeting in the parliament building , which apparently one can rent . 
  so why is this newsworthy ? 
  [ fuck gema ] ( http://www.ssyoutube.com/watch?v=mmqf2rshnbw ) ( click on the thumbnail on the right to play directly ), 
  it 's the same - if a store accepts credit cards ( which is n't often , at least in germany ) it will certainly take visa and mastercard , but probably not amex . 
  same with atms . 
  i have a corporate amex card for business travel expenses and i can usually only use it at hotels or for buying airline tickets . 
  relatedly , i 've always found it weird that italian speakers can understand spanish , but not the other way around . 
  or maybe it 's spanish speakers understanding italian , but not the other way around . 
  no , that 's not what i 'm saying ( and as a german taxpayer , i have a horse in this race - i 'd rather my taxes go to german social programs or , i do n't know , building windmill farms in romania or something equally useful ) . 
  what i 'm saying is that the average greek on the street did n't cause this mess , nor did the average german . 
  yeah , i suppose that a greek shopkeeper who makes $ 1000 a month contributes to it by not paying taxes , but even if she had paid , taxes would n't make up for the amount of debt their corrupt politicians happily got them into . 
  likewise , the average german is n't to blame for the mess either - but it was partly our banks who made the bad investments , and it is partly our politicians who are demanding that we cover those banks losses while also demanding these austerity measures . 
  also , it was partly german goods that the greeks bought with their borrowed money . 
  like i said , it 's not a clear case of `` greece bad , germany good '' - it 's a mess with no good solution . 
  german banks worked with american banks and corrupt greek politicians to pump greece 's broken , tax-dodging economy full of money they could n't pay back . 
  now german and other eu politicians want to make the average greeks ( who often do n't pay taxes , but also are n't really to blame for the mess they 're now in ) suffer more while they transfer eu taxpayer money to german banks via greece . 
  there are a lot of villains in the story , and no heroes . 
   early wanting system early wanting system : ordering your second beer when the waitress comes by to bring you your first . 
  there is that , but most people i know think of it in more local terms - the soldiers go out and behave like assholes when they are n't on the base , or pilots fly helicopters right over peoples homes at midnight and laugh at the suggestion that maybe they could have some respect for noise laws . 
  on the other hand , a lot of germans work on the bases , and a lot of german tradespeople around the bases make their living thanks to the military being there . 
  so it 's a lot of local concerns , rather than geopolitical . 
  but from my perspective , every weekend if you were to go into the center of my normally very peaceful and crime-free city , you would see us soldiers getting drunk and fighting with each other . 
  last summer a group of them had a big fistfight in the middle of my favorite biergarten .
