  callisto is a greek nymph ? 
  callisto is missing . 
  that 's discrimination of the periphery . 
  i 'm not an expert either , i just happen to know that paragraph . 
  not access to the constitutional court per se , but art . 
  19 ( 3 ) gg reads :  the basic rights shall also apply to domestic artificial persons to the extent that the nature of such rights permits . 
  domestic is the key word here . 
  foreign companies are not protected by the basic rights in the german constitution , therefore vattenfall 's case is likely to be dismissed . 
  the constitutional court will likely drop the case for vattenfall as only companies registered in germany can sue there . 
  eon and rwe will likely get a judgement there and vattenfall probably has to go to an investment court to get one so of course they do it . 
  the uk , which had a gdp ( ppp ) per capita of 128.2 % of the eu-28 average in 2005 and of 109.7 % in 2015 , is not suitable for the argument you seem to want to make . 
  denmark and sweden also barely grew faster than the eu-28 . 
  meanwhile romania went from 34.2 % ( 2005 ) to 56.6 % ( 2015 ) and poland from 49.6 % ( 2005 ) to 68.4 % ( 2015 ) of the eu average . 
  well , pkk also does not blow up bombs in germany , just in turkey , and they are still recognised as a terrorist organisation . 
  to clear things up a little : german law says ( loosely , the full paragraphs are found [ here ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1217 ) ) that it is a terrorist organisation `` if one of the offences stipulated in nos 1 to 5 [ essentially manslaughter , assault , kidnapping and a few more ] is intended to seriously intimidate the population , to unlawfully coerce a public authority or an international organisation through the use of force or the threat of the use of force , or to significantly impair or destroy the fundamental political , constitutional , economic or social structures of a state or an international organisation , and which , given the nature or consequences of such offences , may seriously damage a state or an international organisation . '', 
  but yes , the federal ministry of justice has to authorise the prosecution of terror organisations outside of the eu , so politics does play a role , strictly according to the saying `` one man 's freedom fighter is another man 's terrorist '' . 
  and the war crimes are enough to designate it a terrorist organisation , no matter how many other groups did commit some anyway . 
  to clarify : the meteor crater can not be seen in the picture , as it is around 20 km in diameter . 
  could surely . 
  but bundling all military counter-espionage/sabotage activity in one service likely has some advantages . 
  the mad also helps with security clearances and vets foreign personnel on deployments which the police would have a hard time doing . 
  until now , the mad ( german military intelligence service ) checked recruits but could do so only after them joining because it is forbidden for them to investigate german civilians . 
  there are proposals now that the mad should also be allowed to check people that have formally declared they want to join the bundeswehr before they actually join . 
  no , efta members are n't eucu members . 
  it also would not be logically possible . 
  being in a customs union means that you have a common external tariff and obviously you can not have two of them . 
  turkey can not join as long as it is a member of eucu . 
  you can not be in two different customs unions at the same time .

  the shooting was in the department for jaw , mouth and face surgery , so maybe someone was discontent with the result of his operation . 
   decapitation has always been an islamic fave and a french one , to be honest . 
  what i wanted to say is that i do n't see any of the modern kit . 
  apparently the more elite units are not participating in the coup . 
  ( although to be fair i also did n't see the old pattons turkey still has . ), 
  i see half of the bundeswehr 's cold war equipment rolling through turkey today . 
  and granting it would be a mistake by germany . 
  he 'd only cause trouble , especially with the turks in germany .

  translation : ** italy 's wish list for the eu ** not the euro and the eu have inhibited italy 's economic growth for 25 years - rome itself can take care of a better education system , a faster judiciary and less bureaucracy . 
  instead of always looking for a scapegoat . 
  `` ottenere '' , to get , is italian politicians ' most important word these days . 
  they try to trump each other in inventing new conditions that italy would have to demand of the shrunken european union after the britons ' exit . 
  prime minister matteo renzi propagates a `` europe of social values , not of limits and procedures '' . 
  italy demands anything possible : room for bigger budget deficits with further effective guarantees for sovereign debts , non - consideration of investments during calculation of budget deficits , european investment programmes , european unemployment money , collectivisation of sovereign debts , eurobonds , common guarantees for the deposits at italian wobble-banks and exceptions from the just decided rules of the banking union , so that italy 's crisis banks can be unwound without government aid . 
  thhis all is justified with arguments that in part sound adventurous in germany but are nevertheless strongly rooted in italian public opinion : germany has been breaking the economic development in the whole of europe with its insistence on austerity . 
  only germany has profited from the currency union , it has sucked the rest of europe dry with an overly large trade balance surplus . 
  with those claims the italians find little opposition in germany . 
  furthermore renzi likes to point to the fact that the germans violated the stability rules of the maastricht treaty first . 
  he remains silent about the italians quietly having been amongst the sinners then as well . 
  after all , rome still relies on the argument that germany is reliant on the italians because the germans do not want and are not able to remain alone any more , due to history alone . 
  these demands as well as their justification are a hint for the very own world italy lives in when it comes to european economic questions . 
  thats how roman navel-gazing gets in the way of a coherent analysis of italian and european challenges . 
  especially for italy with its large mountain of debt the euro was a recuing anchor at first . 
  in the euro crisis , various rescue funds and the banking union were also erected with the aim of preventing the spark of the financial markets to fly over to the italian economy . 
  not the euro and the eu have inhibited italian economic growth for 25 years but the effects of globalisation and the lacking will for reforms . 
  why should germany or the eu be responsible for youth unemployment of 40 % if italy refuses to introduce a solid apprenticeship system ? 
  is it not in the national responsibility that small enterprises do not grow and are not competitive , that lame bureaucracy and justice at snails pace scare away investors , that successful italian companies rather invest abroad or that many chances in the tourism market remain unused for decades ? 
  ** germany is not keen on that ** instead of honouring the protective effects of europe for the wobbly italian economy , the italian prime minister rather instrumentalises europe as a scapegoat . 
  for many petty and populist maneuvers of day to day politics the eu , brussels and of course also berlin are welcome opponents , from which italy 's politicians are able to pry always new concessions with allegedly heroic efforts . 
  renzi boasts , that he got out 30 billion euros of `` flexibility '' for italy 's budget . 
  now italy may erect a government shield of 150 billion euros for the banks . 
  this has rather symbolic character , which is why the haggling for the use of more government money for capital increases and the reduction of non-performing loans continues . 
  like that or similarly is how almost all italian politicians behaved in recent years , no matter if it 's the minister for agriculture got out a fifth increase of milk quotas long ago or later prime minister mario monti got a mechanism for limiting the risk surcharge on government titles , paid for by all others . 
  nobody ever came back from brussels with the remark , italy had to make a sacrifice for the solidarity in europe . 
  contrarily : the europe where something can `` be gotten '' becomes a quarry for a little piece of popularity . 
  this way of course , european rules , even treaties , remain only annoying side issues or just sound and smoke . 
  from the roman perspective this seems legitimate , even when the same principle would encite head shaking in football : could the italians get an exclusive suspension of the offside rule maybe there as well or perhaps a smaller goal ? 
  politics maybe works differently . 
  still the italians may not be angry if nobody in germany is keen on drafting new treaties and rules for deeper european integration with just these roman politicians . 
  european parliament : * change towards `` one citizen , one vote '' representation , guarantee 3 seats for smaller members , keep size * open list proportional voting system , 3 % hurdle nationwide , constituencies set by member states ( min . 
  4 seats per constituency ) * election every 4 years instead of 5 * ep gains right to initiate legislation european commission : * rename president of the commission to prime minister of the eu to avoid confusion * pm of the eu must be mep * european council may propose first candidate for mp with absolute majority * pm is elected by the ep with absolute majority * if proposed candidate is not elected , ep may choose its own candidate * mp may choose his commissioners and their number however he wants * commission as a whole needs confirmation of ep european council : * president of the eu is directly elected every 4 years with single transferable vote * president gains right to initiate directives * president needs to sign bills and has retarding veto ( 2 years ) , may not veto a bill twice * president may speak ( not vote ) in the ep and the council of the eu council of the eu : * rename to european senate to avoid confusion * large countries get 4 votes , medium countries 3 and small countries 2 votes ( population thresholds to be set reasonably ) * senate gains right to initiate legislation * directives and regulations follow the same legislative process * legislative one-way street : senate may only vote up or down on bills passed by the ep , not change them ( exception : budget ) * two-thirds majority of votes required to pass bills ( some cases : unanmity ) * budget process : proposed by ec , debated and unanimously passed in senate , confirmed by ep with absolute majority ( minimum every 2 years ) competencies : * no change, 
  depends on who crumbles faster and more . 
  the uk is also not at its most stable at the moment . 
  i would speculate that cameron just does not know what to demand in negotiations and also is not willing to do the work for `` leave '' .
