  so it 's fine if you annex part of another country if it 's been part of you country in the past ? 
  asking for a friend ^ ^ ly ^ ^ country . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.bka.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/publikationen/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/2015/pks2015jahrbuch.pdf?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=5 ) are 396 pages of statistics listing just about every type of crime that happened in germany in 2015 . 
  the 2016 version will be out in may . 
  ( i think it 's only available in german ), 
  many far right parties are pretty authoritarian . 
  do you have a problem with that or is `` big government '' fine for you on a national level ? 
  i 'm asking because your views seem more libertarian than that . 
  it 's a right wing propaganda site , and people are obsessed about it because the former leader is now one of the most important persons in the white house after getting trump elected . 
  we will . 
  but only if the asylum request is denied , the return is deemed safe and all legal procedures are carried out . 
  this is a much cheaper way to get rid of opportunists . 
  everyone can request asylum , but people taking an offer like this probably are n't refugees . 
  but i guess you know that already . 
  they 're onto that problem , too . 
  have n't you seen the pictures of detained children at airports ? 
  trump is making america safe again . 
  that could be misunderstood , right . 
  i was speaking about `` child marriage '' in general and sex between 17 an 18 year olds can be legal . 
  where do you see me defending that ? 
  i 'm just explaining the laws . 
  sex might be illegal and a criminal offense . 
  the marriage would at worst be void , but under current laws mostly acknowledged . 
  and it certainly is n't a criminal offense in germany to have married someone in the past in another country . 
  they are in germany now , that means following german law . 
  but it is german law that marriages from other countries are legal if they are carried out in accordance with the law of that country . 
  it will be changed soon but currently that 's the case . 
  & gt ; wait ... so if myself and my partner ( two men ) get married in the uk and then live in germany , then germany would accept it as legal ? 
  as it had been carried out in accordance with british law ? 
  it would carry over as a civil union . 
  & gt ; so why is this , which is actually a criminal offence under eu law , allowed ? 
  is this true ? 
  i ca n't imagine marrying a child is a criminal offense , it 's just not possible here . 
  would be like making it a criminal offence for a child to get a driver 's license , it 's just not possible and does n't make sense . 
  they are anti-constitutional but not able to do anything about it . 
   is n't it true that refugee influx increased heavily after `` we can do it '' ? 
  it increased heavily before that and continued heavily increasing after that . 
   and that less than a third were syrian ? 
  more than half of them are from syria and iraq , countries affected by the civil war and isis . 
  i am not saying it made no difference , but the destabilized middle east was the cause , not an open door policy . 
  if foreign powers did n't destabilize the region , people would n't have to flee by the millions . 
  ( simplified version ) the open door policy was set in place ( also simplified version ) long after the people were already fleeing en masse . 
  merkel is on top of cdu 's list , so anybody can vote for her/her party but people in bavaria . 
  but technically no one directly votes for her as chancellor . 
  no , not normally . 
  they decide for a joint candidate . 
  last one for csu was in 2002 ( stoiber ) . 
  but if they continue with their `` differences '' and csu starts their own campaign this election who knows . 
  that does n't make sense , germany did n't take part in the iraq war so it did n't have an effect . 
  because her party ( cdu ) is n't on the ballot in bavaria . 
  here they have a sister party ( csu ) which is independent and has a different leader . 
  same for me except i could n't vote for her even if i wanted . 
  the full quote is even better . 
   there is a link between america 's flawed interventionist policy , especially the iraq war , and the refugee crisis , that 's why my advice would be that we should n't tell each other what we have done right or wrong , but that we look into establishing peace in that region and do everything to make sure people can find a home there again, 
  except we 're not handing out passports . 
  maybe in your country , in germany i have only ever seen it to describe hoaxes . 
  technically the existence of police brutality in russia is n't proof that protesters protesting for the right to protest get beaten . 
  just makes it more likely . 
   [ x ] no nation , no borders not true  [ x ] prosecution of any critics not true  [ x ] calls germans `` people who have lived here longer '' as opposed to a race ? 
  if you want to call that left ...  [ x ] houses , feeds , support economic migrants with billions that one is true , but she would rather not . 
  deportation is mostly blocked by other parties . 
   [ x ] abolished nuclear energy , one of the core reasons the green party was founded she turned back towards nuclear energy until public opinion turned on her and she felt forced to do that . 
   [ x ] extremely pro eu not really left/right . 
   [ x ] advocate for gay , trans , whatever perversion rights no , she is n't . 
  she 's against marriage equality and adoption rights for gay couples . 
   [ x ] passed law that made circumcision legal for jews and muslims definitely not left . 
  ( the left parties tried to make it illegal )  [ x ] supports israel also not left . 
  ( the left is very critical of israel )  [ x ] supports saudi arabia also not a left/right thing . 
  ( the left is very critical towards arms support to saudi-arabia )  [ x ] hates the germans a lie . 
   [ x ] childless not politics . 
   [ x ] ex stasi another lie . 
   she is surpassing antifa in regards of leftism no she is n't . 
   and calls it progressivism . 
  no she does n't . 
  so unwanted economic migrants would be the best term . 
  do you have a source on not-actually-syrians being granted asylum as syrians ? 
  and what should the media report different when these are also the numbers they have . 
  pretend the majority are not syrian without any sources . 
  claim things they ca n't proove ? 
  based on the facts i have access to at this point the media reporting about refugees as if they are mostly syrian seems ok . 
  most of the media always use the terms wrong . 
  refugees are people fleeing from war and oppression . 
  all refugees are migrants . 
  all refugees are asylum applicants once in sweden . 
  not all migrants and asylum applicants are refugees , the ones who are not will be denied asylum . 
  http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.2d998ffc151ac3871592564/1483353481929/avgjorda+asyl%c3%a4renden+2016+-+asylum+decisions+2016.pdf according to this 44218 of 67258 people that were granted asylum were syrian . 
  that 's more than 65 % . 
  while it 's certainly not all of them it means about two thirds of `` refugees '' are actually syrian . 
  source ? 
  the numbers from 2015 say otherwise . 
  tbh no one advocates for that , it just happens . 
  that does n't mean they do n't pay their employees decently . 
  that 's called context , not excuses . 
   and the german flag . 
  fear , or disgust , ca n't be 100 % sure . 
  wow , you must really hate the german flag . 
  and do n't make up excuses . 
  i see you have also seen that one gif without context . 
  but these people know they wo n't get asylum and are n't the ones trying to get their families here . 
  people that throw their passports away are totally irrelevant to this topic .
