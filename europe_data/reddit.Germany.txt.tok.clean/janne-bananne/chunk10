   you seem to believe that you know what the results of the brexit will be . 
  i do n't have to believe . 
  there 's some very simple things in the world . 
  for example , paying tariffs makes imported goods more expensive for your people . 
  i do n't have to prove that , or ask an expert to know that . 
  and when the rules are `` accept immigration or you do n't get financial passporting '' , then there are few alternatives , and you can predict all three of them : accept immigration , no financial passporting , custom deal . 
   verschlimmbesserung perfect description of brexit , though . 
  i only know that several companies are already planning to leave , and many people made their personal decisions based on that , too . 
  and mifid ii will still require free movement and eea membership , which means the uk has to accept free movement -- the biggest thing the vote was even about . 
   italian banks just requested a $ 40bln bailout for its banking system . 
  the imf just called deutsche bank the single biggest threat to the global financial stability . 
  boe just bailed out theirs , too . 
  exactly . 
  so we have to only make things legal that , even if used in too large amounts , stays secure . 
  it also has ` screenshot -- selector ' #thing _ t1_d4ty3gd ' ` , for example . 
  so awesome . 
  well , we have spectacle for that , 
  about 2 or 3 years ago ? 
  because that very same sentence could also be interpreted the other way around , and i 've seen it before in a context like `` the uk does n't need the eu , we can do without them , in fact , we 've done very well out of eu '' , so i got confused . 
  i guess that person meant `` outside of the eu '' then ? 
  if language was just easier . 
  wonder how the eu politicians manage , everything translated thrice , no one speaks everyone 's language . 
  well , in the correct dose . 
  there 's been many cases of farmers just spraying many times the maximum dose to try and get an effect against resistant plants . 
  obviously , having a far more likely negative effect . 
  eu laws have to also take into account overuse of products based on realistic usage , not just on what the marketing says . 
  ( even though they do n't do that everywhere , yet , for example regarding cars  _  ), 
  if used at the correct doses . 
  a lot of farmers spray twice , thrice , often four times the maximum dose to get more of an effect . 
  that then does pose a risk . 
   i think it is a bit early to say with certainty that the uk is going to be economically impacted . 
  companies are already paying lawyers and planners to plan how to leave the uk , and not just small sums . 
  several companies stopped plans to invest . 
  even assuming we 'd freeze exactly where we are , the british economy would make a noticeable drop of maybe a year of growth being lost . 
  and that 's just a week of effects . 
  once companies actually move away , it will get a lot more noticable . 
  you ca n't deny that there will be a negative impact at least in the short term . 
  nippy, 
  you do remember how hysteric everyone was during the last us government shutdown ? 
  this is worse , so considering the situation , they 're still quite calm . 
   the uk has done very well out of the eu . 
  but not out of the ec . 
  and nowadays , it 's eea , eu , or bust . 
  sadly , all the late night shows are on summer break . 
  this would be an occassion for a daily show just about that . 
  is n't he already ? 
  boris trump , future president of the us of a, 
   however , it seems that post-fact politics goes along with post-spine politicians . 
  good god , then i do n't want to know what happens if trump gets control . 
  i do n't use third party tools much , as i have kde spectacle and this firefox feature for everything . 
  which is so evil , it 's now illegal . 
  do n't use the mafia 's adblock , use \u00b5block . 
  ( sarcasm aside , ad block plus collects around 30 million eur per year from google and yahoo to exclude some advertisements ), 
  well , the -- fullpage stuff is useful because you can take a screenshot of a huge webpage with a long scrollbar , containing everything . 
  rekt . 
  not really intentional , ryanair is betting a lot on the eu . 
  in firefox , press shift + f2 , then enter ` screenshot ` and press enter . 
  you can also do ` screenshot -- fullpage ` to make a screenshot of the full page , or ` screenshot -- imgur ` to upload to imgur , or ` screenshot -- fullpage -- imgur ` to make a full screenshot and upload . 
   if nationalism is wanting to govern your own country , then call me and that guy a nationalist . 
  you do realize you had a veto power in the council ? 
  you had over 16 % of representatives in parliament ? 
  you were governing your own country just as much as you will be afterwards . 
  no , but `` all nationalists prefer people of their own nation over those of others '' . 
  even if that means doing politics that risk seperating families , destroying economies , etc. 
  and i 've had it with that . 
  why do we make politics only for people that happen to be born next to us ? 
  why make politics only for people of same color , of same ethnics , etc ? 
  i mean , seriously , if someone wants to follow our traditions , speak our language , and live like us , why not let them live ? 
  seriously , what does beating up foreigners do for the right-populist crowd in the uk ? 
  what does saying `` deport all muslims '' do for the trump-supporters ? 
  i just do n't understand it . 
  that 's what it does sound like , indeed . 
  nationalism . 
  well , because you voted against it ? 
  and the categorical imperative says you can only want something , if you want it either everywhere , for everyone , or nowhere , for no one . 
  so , you argue , we should have no parliamentary democracy at all ? 
  because that always means your representative can be overruled by a majority of others . 
  and ** java ** script contains the word java . 
  and ** car ** pet contains the word car . 
  and ** red ** dit contains the word red . 
  that 's just as meaningful : not at all . 
  and , as i said above , please specify a historic precedent for something being called tribute as part of a normal trade deal both sides could cancel at any time . 
  i ca n't find any . 
  the issue is that wto rules only allow trade of goods . 
  the uk mostly deals in services . 
  ( banking and legal ones , esp . ), 
  without special treaties , they ca n't provide any of those outside their own borders . 
  they 're even arguing about privatizing nhs and leaving the echr, 
  just that that would also justify scotland leaving the uk ( because the scottish parliament ca n't block uk directives , regulations , and decisions they disagree with nor can they set quotas when it comes to uk migration . ), 
  i 'm not the person you replied to . 
  you always with your `` eu = empire '' `` membership fees = tribute '' . 
  it 's not . 
  the uk is not being ruled by the eu , not paying tribute . 
  they can always leave , and until now , they even ruled the eu ( well , 1/16th of it ) . 
  not even in 1800 membership fees of such alliances were considered tribute . 
  there 's zero , nada , no historic precedent of it being called a tribute . 
   governed by the eu governed by the eu parliament they elected in may 2014 . 
  ftfy . 
  btw , you 're represented by farage in there , mostly . 
  the rest of the british parliamentarians is mostly meh .
