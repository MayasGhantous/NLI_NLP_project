  no , eu law . 
  as soon as negotiations start , automatically a 2 year deadline is set . 
  this was proposed in 2009 by the uk to the eu , and the eu adopted it . 
   but the us senate was balancing democracy versus civil liberties when your country was fighting over the feudal rights of kings . 
  i 'm not going to contest that germany especially did such things , considering they only got democracy about 20 years before they annexed us . 
  but the us has always focused more on raw democracy than europe . 
  they depend heavily on your economy , and you just voted out ? 
  any brexit will hit , in the eu , the irish worst . 
  it reminds me a bit of my cat . 
  constantly going in , and out , and in , and out , and in , and out . 
  always keeping the door open , but it 's getting cold outside now , so i have to shut the door . 
  their decision which side they 're on , but no `` in and out '' anymore . 
   this is bourgeois democracy and not an issue for europe anymore . 
  the island in the middle of the atlantic \u2122 has to deal with it now . 
  `` people with eu flair are dangerous '' , you say ? 
  why ? 
  do you fear a european national identity might develop , and europe might end up strong enough to have actual power against the russians ? 
  or what is it you fear ? 
  the thing is , it 's not `` freedom : yes/no '' , even if you claim it is . 
  it 's `` have a job : no/yes '' . 
  it 's `` pay 20 % extra for imported products : no/yes '' . 
  it 's `` privatize the nhs despite everyone saying otherwise : yes/yes '' . 
  it 's `` kick out foreigners : no/no '' . 
  it 's `` have a say in brussels : no/yes '' . 
  it 's not such a simple thing . 
  and especially britain becomes less independent by leaving the eu and going to a norwegian model : now they have to follow almost all eu law , and get taxed , but do n't even get a single vote on it . 
  so , practically , despite claimed to be `` freedom : yes/no '' , it was more a `` freedom : no/yes '' , with the options being opposite of what people thought they 'd be . 
  sure if you think it 's more important to have populist support , okay . 
  i know the us was more for rule of the people than for economic and political reasoning -- as can be seen in the ability to elect nazis , if you wanted to , or in the fact that judges can be elected in many states only requiring high school education . 
  but we thought the uk did realize that democracy is a flawed concept when you make decisions that affect people for centuries , and let populists decide the outcome . 
  the future generations will be hit hardest -- and they do n't even get a vote . 
  that 's part of why the eu exists instead of an immutable set of trade treaties -- a lot of the treaties were changed over the years when new generations started voting , which would have been harder with immutable treaties . 
  the surprise , and the shock , is that the uk falls for the populist . 
  yes , he did , he suggested moving the office of the financial minister and the entire tax system to brussels , and giving himself the job because no one else is qualified during the negotiations around greece . 
  i do n't want to see them go and punch or kill another one due to feeling ignored by the british government , though . 
  yes , it was an emergency meeting , they did n't exactly follow protocol . 
  and supporters who beat up a handful of immigrants already this week . 
  it 's scary indeed , and it 's meant to be . 
  i mean , it 's a * fabula * representing the very current situation -- the tories promoted the referendum to get more votes , ukip allied with the right-radicals to get also more votes , and now the tories ca n't get rid of ukip and the brexit they got , and ukip ca n't get rid of the right-radicals beating up foreigners . 
  it 's surprising that the comparison has n't been made yet . 
  the parliament is designed like the german one : the meps sitting in a half circle , facing the commission ( or government ) sitting in a block .

  there 's this german poem , [ the sorcerers apprentice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sorcerer%27s_apprentice ) , i think it fits the situation well . 
  basically , the sorcerer leaves , the apprentice is supposed to do something , and decides to cast some spells , call some spirits to help him . 
  they start doing what he wants , yet continue it even more extreme and more extreme , becoming a danger , he tries to get rid of them , and ca n't do it . 
  * die geister die ich rief , werd ich nun nicht mehr los * `` the spirits that i called , i ca n't control them anymore ! '', 
  ( literally : ca n't get rid of them ) . 
  i think it fits the situation very well . 
  yes , disney turned it into a short : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrm8usah0sm ( second half : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ait_fs6uqhq ) sadly i ca n't find a full version online . 
  just look over at the other thread were the suggestion for making the commission more democratic was suggested by politicians . 
  half the comments are `` we need ever closer union and democracy '' , the other half is `` eussr is literally stalin '', 
  exactly . 
  and the same with many larger companies . 
   how about tax breaks big enough to offset things ? 
  for vodafone , that 'd mean ** -100 % ** taxes . 
  that 's ... kinda unlikely . 
  ( they 'd lose 50 % of their profit by staying in uk during brexit ), 
  technically , the us ca n't vote for a president either . 
  check and mate . 
  the entire brexit campaign was about a `` free trade treaty '' instead of the eu . 
  it sure does sound like they want to replace the eu with ttip 2.0, 
  write to your representatives in the national parliament , too -- national states still have a lot of influence in the eu . 
  because every time giving them power was tried , ukip , afd and co called it a `` move for dictatorship of the bureaucrats '' . 
  well , because doing so would lead to the eu falling apart . 
  that would be presented as `` eu dictatorship getting full dictator powers '' in the national media . 
   but also for the ability to regulate the flow of free movement into the uk from within the eu . 
  that can not exist within a single market . 
  scotland ca n't ever close the border to england either . 
  seriously , do you not understand that a single market economy ** can not ever work ** with closed internal borders ? 
  sch\u00e4uble already did . 
  germany is generally okay with the general situation , except for about 11 % people on the right wing . 
  so , most of the political attitude is `` meh '' , and so everything continues as before . 
  that 's not even bad . 
   and senate where is equal number of senators from each country that 's the eu council . 
  it 's really interesting , there have been many articles about it , but the same politicians that talk in westminster against the eu , once they are in brussels for a meeting , are completely proponents of a federal state , and support everything germany suggests . 
  it 's an interesting phenomenon , but the leaders of many eu nations do that . 
  many got into power by using the eu as scapegoat , but secretly they do n't want to leave either . 
   because i then wonder why all the interests seemed to be behind remaining . 
  brexit is more outside influence , but bremain still means more profit . 
  having influence in north korea is useless , even if you are the dictator , you ca n't make money . 
  influence is only useful if you actually can make profit . 
   our leaving also swings the balance of power further toward germany and france , meaning less say for the smaller nations . 
  i 'm sure they will love that . 
  often a misconception , but the uk has backed germany in the council for every single decision except immigration for the past decade . 
  germany lost a lot of power last thursday . 
   so what he was saying is that there would n't be a united states of europe without one european country playing that role . 
  germany does n't want it , but will likely have to take that role . 
  yeah sure . 
  me being proud of being in a nation with the bloody prussians that annexed our land ? 
  or being with the fokin bavarians ? 
  you really think the bavarians ever really integrated and thought of them as germans first ? 
  i 'd disagree . 
  and i 'd also say the same about many of the -- even today -- still danish folk or rural folk in the annexed lands from 1864 . 
  technically , nothing prevents a nation from letting their people vote for who will represent them in the council . 
  in most nations , the representative for the council is elected at the same time as national elections , though , and is automatically chosen from the party list of the party that won the national elections . 
  sure , the council corresponds more to the german second chamber than to the us house , but it 's still not far off -- representing state interests , instead of national interests , and being directly or indirectly elected . 
  some places in bavaria have already 0.3 % corporate tax -- the point three difference are n't going to change much , and you have to pay london rent in contrast . 
  or you could just have a one guy subsidiary in london , and channel the money through there -- like what everyone does with dublin now . 
  then why keep the hq in the uk at all ? 
  if you need to follow eu law anyway , have a business in the eu , wages in the eu are lower , and you make more profit there , why keep anything in the uk ?
