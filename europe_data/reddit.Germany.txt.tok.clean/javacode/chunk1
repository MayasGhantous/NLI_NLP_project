what does she stand for politically ? 
  so you mean that the presence of token muslims in tv kinda backfires ? 
  in no way do i believe that the number plate was n't chosen deliberately . 
  no way !, 
  and clarkson is a spineless coward for not admitting it . 
  i think it 's mainly the grammar that made english so successful . 
  declension and conjugation basically do n't exist . 
  apart from the third person singular in verbs and the genitive in nouns of course but that 's still easy as pie . 
  now compare that to russian , german , finnish and most other european languages . 
  fyi , those sound words are called [ onomatopoeias ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/onomatopoeia ) and here is a [ large cross-linguistic list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias ) of them . 
  and dornfelder red wine . 
  kommunist !, 
  germany has * clearly * the best fog !, 
  you actually pronounce it volkl\u00e4nds but you spell it wrong . 
  this needs to be fixed now . 
  thanks for your input but that 's a weltmeisterdecision and it 's undisputable . 
   why not just keep it as valkland ? 
  who is weltmeister ? 
  you or we ? 
  well ok granted , but they have to be renamed to `` volkland inseln '' :p, 
  lol !, 
  hahaha !, 
  are czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligible ? 
  does it make very little effort to speak the other language ? 
  is english taught in every czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage ( and opportunity ) to use it in practice ? 
  a more sincere contest full of unintended comedy ? 
  that 'd be like eurovision 20 years ago when it was really funny to watch . 
  good news :d, 
  russian cat loses ears after hearing transvestite music . 
  haha good to know that germany 's press is not the only one who does that shit :d ours does that for * every single * football world cup and european championship to come outside of germany , pointing out our superior venues and infrastructure and how we 'd be capable to hold the events * any * time . 
  that 's actually what gave me the idea to add the queen song :d love laibach !, 
  that contains ss . 
  ^ get ^ it ? 
  ^ ^ get ^ ^ it ? 
  happy cake day btw . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aysixusnjd0 ), 
  i wonder what an occultist like you 'd say if i told you that almost every german adult has a [ f\u00fchrer licence ] ( http://dict.leo.org/#/search=f%c3%bchrerschein&amp;searchloc=0&amp;resultorder=basic&amp;multiwordshowsingle=on ) . 
  yes and i blame brits for that arithmetical acrobatics because britain is the beneficiary . 
  hehehe , you get bonus points for decently ignoring norway . 
  excellent job !, 
  ^ ^ norway : ^ ^ 5 ^ ^ million ^ ^ inhabitants , ^ ^ 26 ^ ^ medals ^ ^ in ^ ^ total . 
  ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ** 52 ** ^ ^ ** medals ** ^ ^ for ^ ^ every ^ ^ 10 ^ ^ million ^ ^ inhabitants ^ ^  ) ), 
  see what i mean ? 
  as hungary on the other page you are just 11 ^ th . 
  i did n't say that british mathematicians are bad at maths but the conspiring smelly guys , presumably brits , who mended the wikipedia page are , 
  that would be a job for the italians . 
  because britain is the beneficiary of that creative accounting , 
  lol !, 
  the conspiring smelly brits are bad at maths , that 's why . 
  haha murica . 
  it 's getting much worse though if we talk about the all-time medal count . 
  have a look at this [ biased rubbish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all-time_olympic_games_medal_table ) ( click 2x * combined total * ) . 
  someone , obviously conspiring smelly brits , mended it by [ diversifying germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all-time_olympic_games_medal_table#germany ) . 
  those cheaters !, 
  now compare that to a [ properly maintained one ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ewiger_medaillenspiegel_der_olympischen_spiele ) , 
  i wish rugby was more popular in germany . 
  my theory is that the moms dd n't allow it back in ~ 1900 because it the cloths got to dirty . 
   border aesthetics lol, 
  i think it 's the [ golf ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/vw_golf ) nowadays . 
  it has been around for 40 years by now . 
  the rheingau and other wine-gowing areas are ** not ** right next to france . 
  nevertheless the map is based upon the main consumption and not on existing viniculture . 
  thanks !, 
   poblacht na seice i think the reason for that is that there is no official short form like * czechia * iirc . 
  had something to do that it sounds identical to historic bohemia and therefor had a negative conotation for some reason . 
  checked wikipedia . 
  it 's [ * an tsacsain * ] ( http://ga.wikipedia.org/wiki/an_tsacsain ) . 
  thanks anyways !, 
  so the direct neighbours do n't have it but all others ? 
  does that imply something ? 
  ~ ~ and what 's the name of saxony , germany in irish ? ~ ~ an tsacsain . 
  that 's what wikipedia is good for after all . 
  why do all countries have it but not eire ? 
  are those five-pointed [ edelweiss swastikas ] ( http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/on_the_front_lines_of_the_culture_wars/files/2011/04/hitler-austrian-women.jpg ) , schluchti ? 
   the anschluss was not very violent , but also not exactly voluntary . 
  proofs my point , the words annexation and invasion are exaggerations in this context . 
  and the austrians cheeringly welcomed `` their boy '' coming home :p, 
  considering the fact how [ the austrians welcomed hitler ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t75ldunc2xw ) makes the word annexation appear a bit too bellingrent for a proper translation . 
  nevertheless , the euphemism is in fact that what makes ` surprise anschluss ` so funny in other contexts in polandball . 
  hehe it looks really nasty for me as german . 
  like * fuckturbate butt * or so , 
   flickorna p\u00e5 that title looks extremely vulgar :d what does it translate to ?

  l\u00fcbeck too . 
  it 's derived from lubice or so . 
  protestantism must not go unmentioned in the anglosphere when it comes to a economic success story from germany . 
  not much longer and merkel is stylised as religious leader  apart from that it 's always nice to learn about germany from foreign publications . 
  never heard of markneukirchen before . 
  nazi . 
  no offence intended . 
  how about a variation of this one ?
