  norway has an economy based on raw materials , just saying . 
  oil and stockfish . 
  they 're one of the richest nation on earth . 
  macron really seems to be the best candidate from what i can tell as an outsider . 
  a grape is small , a water melon is huge . 
  : doing little efforts but expecting huge returns . 
  i wrote that we have tatar too and that i love it  metka looks like [ mett * wurst * ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/mettwurst ) in general and [ zwiebelmettwurst ] ( http://www.schinken-braasch.de/images/cm/shop-bilder/gross/zwiebelmettwurst-h2196029bg.jpg ) ( onion mett sausage ) in particular . 
  it 's very similar but mett is ground freshly by the butcher 2-3x per day . 
  it 's often replaced by mettwurst in breakfast bars because it 's less perishable . 
  do n't tell me she 's fishing for communists ' votes . 
  and what about ukraine , does n't anybody in france care for its sovereignty ? 
  russophilia is one thing , illegal occupation is another . 
  \\* ** free ** movement of capital , workers , goods and services . 
  in the context of the article , these freedoms are the relevant values . 
  here 's more , i hope your attention span allows you to read it . 
  just saying , because obviously you have n't read the article either : http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/objectives_en.htm#values, 
   hoppe said that the ** eu 's four freedoms -- for the movement of capital , workers , goods and services ** -- will have more influence over merkel 's stance than german companies . 
  oh what a loss , i love le dessous des cartes / mit offenen karten . 
  [ here 's a pdf with a map ] ( http://www.interrail.ag/uploads/media/interrail_group_flyer_2015_en_web.pdf ) . 
  looks like it does n't use the transsib but goes through china and kazakhstan . 
  in duisburg the containers are trans-loaded onto special platforms approved for the channel tunnel . 
  yes , we have [ mett ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mett ) . 
  raw minced pork with spices and onion . 
  for breakfast . 
  and we have tartar too . 
  love both , once in a while . 
  everything clear now , thanks !, 
  so the length of the vertical line on the right-hand side is not an indicator for the degree of clarity ? 
  clarity is clarity and good ? 
  they 're extremely tough negotiators when comes to purchase prices . 
  they use their full market power . 
  imagine how many million pieces they order when they e.g. 
  buy laptops for their shops worldwide . 
  but on the pro side , and i hope get that together correctly , the incentive for the suppliers is that aldi offers much better conditions due to their quick turnover times . 
  conventional supermarkets have the products much longer on the shelves and delivery on credit is common practice . 
  in short , aldi pays the bills earlier . 
  another thing is that producers look for volume deals with them to be able afford better machinery which benefits their sale of brand articles at a premium elsewhere . 
  they 've do it keep unions away . 
  saves them money in the end and it 's good for the image if customers know that the staff is paid above average . 
  most people have phases with low income in their lives . 
  students for example . 
  then aldi is gold . 
  you 'll realize that the quality is good and go shopping there in better times too . 
  `` former eastern bloc is eastern europe '' is a common stereotype . 
  intuitively i still adhere to it too . 
  are those really the `` capitals '' and not just selected cities where the samplings took place ? 
  it 's stated that the study is based on 60 + cities . 
  that does n't mean they 're the capitals . 
  hard to believe that drug abuse is worse in d\u00fclmen than in hamburg or frankfurt . 
  monarchy and daily life . 
   tantenverf\u00fchrer meh , i find althuhnj\u00e4ger ( old chicken hunter ) funnier . 
  now i want so see fog over foggia . 
  hehe , i knew that would come , 
  no sure if it 's a hoax . 
  anyways , i 'd never eat a dog . 
  that 'd be cannibalism . 
  a cat on the other hand , why not ? 
  donated . 
   for some unknown reason the saga goes that the two could n't agree on whether or not selling cigarettes . 
   i grew up thinking i spoke perfect high german , like the people on tv . 
  me too , until recorded my first voice-mail . 
  i was completely shocked  ), 
  dialect is dialect . 
  seriously , it 's ridiculous how hamburgers , bremers or other northerners think they speak high german . 
  yes , north of hanover . 
  i said nothing about hanover . 
  northern germans * only think they speak high german . 
  it 's a common belief up there and it 's ridiculous . 
  \\* edit : north of hanover, 
  occupied by the * swiss * lol . 
  even better than by italy , something i thought was hilarious already . 
  meh , too easy to [ retort ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/france_map_lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation-de.svg/800px-france_map_lambert-93_with_regions_and_departments-occupation-de.svg.png ) .

  according to the article it 's `` never forget syria , never forget aleppo '' and `` those responsible for these crimes , will pay the price for it '' . 
   the only people really asking this eu falling apart question seriously are based in the uk . 
  secretly they hope that others are as stupid as them . 
  then they would n't be the butt of jokes anymore . 
  rather of frau kepetry and her afd . 
  there 's a wall of silence surrounding the notorious g\u00e4vleborg straw merchants mafia . 
  they 've ties to the highest ranks in the fire department . 
  yes , it 'll be all `` i know the beast from within and it 's * evil !, 
  thanks . 
  what if those eu brits found subsidiaries of british companies though , that are nothing more than just mailboxes ? 
  there might be a tariff on the goods and services they sell but the uk could equalize that with lower taxes in such a way that it 's effectly access to the single market . 
  just worried that such an generous policy backfires and is abused . 
  we should only let those in we need and detain british boat people on an island , ideally the isle of britain . 
  joking aside , how 's that not pretty much what the brexiters want ? 
  access to the common market ( job market at least ) and no immigrants from the eu into the uk ? 
  you are aware that i was n't entirely serious , are you ? 
  nevertheless , fact is he does n't care for his homeland , otherwise he would n't leave , and he hates the eu . 
  maybe he 'll just become a pundit on fox news . 
  farage does n't care for his homeland , i think he get 's paid by putin to harm the eu . 
  that 's why he [ leaves for greener pastures is the us ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/nigel-farage-planning-to-move-to-us-ambassador/ ) , presumably his new order is to conspire trump into inciting an economic war with the eu . 
  / my theory , 
  exactly my first thought too . 
  mu st 4:20 in english . 
  an ant had a giggle there . 
  it was good for the kurds indeed . 
  nevertheless , iraq was just a randomly chosen drop-off zone for exorbitant priced cruise missiles , an enrichment operation for bush friends like halliburton and big oil . 
  and you are still paying off the bill .
