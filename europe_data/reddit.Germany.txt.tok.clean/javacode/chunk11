  well it was the official position back them . 
  if you have to see it this way you 're right . 
  nevertheless are you seriously defending the iraq war as justified ? 
  objectively ? 
  or are you just hurt in your patriotic pride that not everybody danced to the us 's tune ? 
  bush was a one-man axis of evil after all . 
  and the outcome of both operations shows that schr\u00f6der was right two times . 
  the iraq war was completely idiotic and so was bush 's `` be with us or be against us '' . 
  i 'm proud that we did n't bow to this impertinent cretin . 
  i think he meant latter not former . 
  we were against the war because there was no un mandate . 
  it seems she only sports headgear for republicans and trumans . 
  wuppertal has always been an economic area with textile production since the middle ages . 
  when the industrial revolution started there was no space left other than above the river . 
  the streets were sized for horse carts adjacent to all kinds of pre-existing milling enterprises everywhere . 
  yes but that might change quickly . 
   marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen ... wrote on ** twitter ** on saturday that ** representatives ** of president-elect donald trump had invited her to ** `` work together . '' ** to me that reads like trump 's new breitbart guy will recruit frenchmen on chan boards . 
  oh , and only a few days ago [ breitbart announced that it plans subsidiaries in france and germany ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/mediawatch/20161114-pro-trump-website-breitbart-expand-france-germany ) first counter-meme is up : https://redd.it/5d5yt9, 
  it 's the most honest statement by a member of the british government so far . 
  let 's face it , they do n't want a brexit , the administration does n't want it and business does n't want it neither . 
  yes and it will be a titanic success . 
  le first `` alt-right '' meme sub is already there : / r/le _ pen . 
  time to counter-meme !, 
  let 's see , urrrm , ** le pen is ... , le pen is ... ** . 
  hmm , something tells me that there must be a pun in there . 
  somewhere . 
  unfortunately i 'm not very good at that , english is not my mother tongue and it 's a well known fact that germans do n't have any humor at all . 
  what i do n't get is how trump having a closer relationship with putin should be bad for the eu . 
  that comes up over and over again recently . 
  according to the putin-understanders the poor bunny felt encircled and isolated . 
  that ukraine 's intention to join the eu was ( only ) the last straw in a series of negative developments from a russian perspective . 
  but that the major issue was the war in syria because it 's a longstanding zone of russian influence . 
  if trump and putin now come to an agreement on how to deal with isis , how can that be bad for the eu ? 
  it might even make it easier to solve the ukraine conflict . 
  you gave me a flashback !, 
  now i finally know why the french chavs found it so funny that one girl was wearing a [ marine nationale ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/mtaynfg3njg=/z/jcsaaoswqirumbbj/$_35.jpg ) t-shirt when i was in france this summer during the ec . 
  oh , it just came natural to me . 
  now i checked and just when i was about to declare myself an linguistic genius i also found out that there was also the now obsolete `` ereyesterday '' , and not foryesterday . 
  half-genius :p anyways , these words have to be reintroduced to euro english . 
  a few suggestions to further enrich it : * ~ ~ next but one ~ ~ \u2192 overnext * ~ ~ the day after tomorrow ~ ~ \u2192 overmorrow * ~ ~ the day after the day after tomorrow ~ ~ \u2192 overovermorrow * ~ ~ the day before yesterday ~ ~ \u2192 foryesterday * ~ ~ yes it is ! ~ ~ \u2192 doch !, 
   but the drama of that near-fusion can help explain the origins of european integration -- and the reasons why britain ultimately pulled away from the european union in the decision we know as brexit . 
  there 's a context to the origins of european integration , agreed , and to uk 's reluctance to join the eu , maybe , but it does n't explain brexit * at all * . 
  it 's an interesting war-time story , but brexit was just an act of insanity and instead of trying to find a deep routed historical link we should pretend we have n't noticed the little mishap . 
  and britain in turn simply let 's it run off into sand . 
   clearly , i 'm talking about the swastika banner not about the symbol itself . 
  using a swastika had zero [ tradition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_germany ) in germany when it was introduced . 
  maybe hitler just found it looked `` cool '' , who knows .

   the swastika banner [ of nazi germany ], 
  i think you mentioned that before . 
  dude , are you aware that you posted that 10 times ? 
  with the difference that the rising sun flag is historical , it 's hundreds of years old . 
  as opposed to the swastika banner which stands for nazi germany and its crimes exclusively . 
  i can understand the sentiment of the koreans and the chinese but i can also understand the japanese who kept it out of tradition . 
  where 's france ? 
  germany should be : ~ ~ maine , new hempshire , vermont , massadingsbums , ~ ~ \\* yawn \\* new england , new york and pennsylvabla . 
  not bad , not bad at all . 
  always loved corto maltese comics !, 
  got ta read them again . 
  that speaks from my heart . 
  britain should let the brexit run off into sand and we pretend we have n't seen or heard anything . 
  it can easier be strong within the eu . 
  and still be a nation . 
   you 're speaking like britain has ceased to exist while it was in the eu and will be nothing outside of it . 
  no i did n't , where did i say that ? 
  the uk 's position as 5th largest global economy is based to a large part on the fact that it 's in the common market . 
   i do n't think swapping nationalism for european nationalism is particularly helpful either . 
  i do n't suggest that at all . 
  i just asked kyoraki to stop the nostalgic and nationalistic reasoning . 
  `` together we are strong '' is very practical and realistic . 
  i meant the reality of a vote for brexit . 
  edited my comment respectively . 
  it 's only the 5th largest global economy because it 's in the eu , still . 
  and you certainly did n't defeat germany alone . 
  you just happened to be on the side of the winners . 
  together we are strong . 
  quit that jingoistic and 80yo war propaganda infested daydreaming , let the brexit nonsense peter out and forget about it . 
  a vid about it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwhj4lj3f-k, 
  good luck for you as a small island enforcing something in trade negotiations with the us , certainly a key market location for scotch whiskey . 
  just recently they gave the word `` wine '' a whole new meaning for example . 
  together we are strong . 
  simply let the brexit run off into sand and forget about it . 
   the swa [ scotch whisky association ] was backing the union campaign in the scottish independence referendum was that they believe that an independent scotland would raise taxes on whisky source ? 
  even if they did , the scottish independence referendum has nothing to do with brexit or the eu . 
  the ~ ~ idea of a brexit ~ ~ reality of a vote for brexit did n't even exist back then . 
  the uk government has * outsourced * the name protection to the eu . 
  * it could 100 % rely on it * because the uk is part of the eu and the eu is a way more powerful player . 
  together we are strong . 
  back in the old days gays were leading edge innovators when it came to music and partying . 
  now look at this lame splashy splashy , that 's what gay marriage does people !, 
  that 's so badly shopped it hurts . 
  to adapt the row of light blue sky in the archs was too much effort , eh ? 
  no , but some i find ridiculous . 
  i bet her mom is embracing `` willkommenskultur '' and totally tolerant , except for german men of course . 
  her father is bald , never says anything and always makes a face like bert from sesame street because mom 's the boss . 
  oh yeah , and it 's all his fault . 
  basically i agree , nevertheless there are people where one of the 2 genders ca n't be clearly identified and this has been happening for millions of years too .
