  i 'll read that now . 
   shares in return for their money lol much much worse . 
  almost beyond imagination . 
  the letter is in context with the introduction of the [ esm ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/europ%c3%a4ischer_stabilit%c3%a4tsmechanismus ) where the participating states commit to common liability but without parliamentary checks . 
  the money goes directly to the troubled banks . 
  there 's just a board that decides in a ** simple majority ** voting to pass-through the taxpayers money . 
  it 's a fatal mistake to introduce something like this before a common fiscal and budgetary policy is guaranteed . 
  the very same mistake is repeated that has been made with the precipitated introduction of the euro . 
  and additionally the possibility to have any influence on the incrusted economic structures of the crisis states is taken away . 
  tl ; dr the taxpayers now pay directly to maladministrated struggling banks, 
  no it had the misfortune to be thought out by a corporate law nerd . 
  happy independence day , do n't drink too much and do n't call random people racists , 
  thanks !, 
  again : you try to pull it on national level . 
  america , europe and germany have all international banks . 
  on this side of the atlantic it was mainly international banks operating in the uk . 
  there they have access to the european market and due to special banking laws they provided the collaterals for wall street . 
  our side did n't invent these assets . 
  maybe they resold it and played the role of proxy . 
  why should i `` just accept '' accept that we , the ez citizens , are about to get royally fucked a second time ? 
  why ? 
  and where did the toxic bonds come from ? 
  from wall street . 
  they cheated on us . 
  there 's no reason to accept any advice from them . 
  bloomberg , come on !, 
  that 's one of the richest investors in the us . 
  i have the feeling we talk at cross-purposes . 
  you try to pull it down to a national level and national banks while i argue for the euro zone 's citizens/taxpayers resistance against international banks . 
  especially against wall street . 
  yes and ? 
  the landesbankem bought a lot of toxic shit from wall street and taxpayers have to pay it . 
  that 's not news to me . 
  and not a reason to support an article that calls to make the same mistakes again . 
  thanks for your answers !, 
  so it 's like distant dialects where both can understand each other if they want but also can fall back to extreme slang if they do n't want to ? 
   first things first . 
  stabilize the eu economy now . 
  put the discussion of new fiscal rules -- step 2 -- on a separate track . 
  paid writer . 
  wall street has toxic bonds of the european crisis states in the amount of 3500 billion in their portofolios . 
  no wonder they are looking for idiots to play the bad bank first and delay changes in fiscal rules to st. neverever 's day . 
  just out of interest : how far apart are the russian and the ukrainian language ? 
  i 'll take that on me the day texas executes the first death penalty on a bank , 
  do you also know how this makes me a racist in executivemonkey 's eyes ? 
  * [ executivemonkey ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/executivemonkey ) wrote *   distinguish between people and banks  i think it 's rather racist to say that some people are n't really people . 
  i 'm not racist and i feel insulted . 
  that 's why i reported you even tough your posting makes little sense . 
  was that supposed to be a joke involving tyra banks or so ? 
  anyways , the current state of the esm means that it 's possible for banks to directly access tax payers money now if they fail . 
  without parlamentary checks . 
  and i do n't mean `` our german '' taxes but the taxes of every european in the euro zone and their children and grand children . 
  if you take a snapshot from today it may look that the finns , dutch , germans and all others with stable finances atm may have lost but this situation can change and countries who celebrate today might be the payers of tommorow . 
  it 's bad for everyone . 
  it ca n't be that the gains of financial institutions are privatised while their losses are socialised . 
  edit : typos and added tyra banks question, 
  smells like adidas viral marketing . 
  ok you see nike as well but it 's brought into context with trouble and police . 
  a real libertarian would have let the looser banks fail years ago . 
  and it 's not a mindless anti-capitalist rant if you boil down flowery euphemisms to their essence . 
  upvoted . 
  could you please remove the misogynic parts from your statement so i can give you an upvote ? 
  it 's not part of the esm . 
  excelllent !, 
  the wealthy react positive ... now that it is possible to access our tax money without any annoying controls . 
  whenever the wealthy went * a little * over the top with gambling . 
  ok . could we now please distinguish between people and banks and agree that the former never pay taxes to latter ? 
  isenkrammannen is funny enough . 
  da iron stuff man . 
  strange , from my observations the presence of german flags rather has gone back this year . 
   ... the world 's most important newspaper bild -- the german paper which shapes anti-greek public opinion in germany and therefore is guiding the entire european crisis ... 
  i too was shocked first by the title but then i found that chain of reason very funny .

  lol edit : churchill is doing the rijkaard at [ 1:55 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5apzasphfsi&amp;t=1m55s ), 
  pay back your debt , slacker !, 
  yes really . 
  like in a work camp . 
  nobody is happy , everything looks dirty and run down when you compare it to the effort that has been invested by the tax payers . 
  and on top of that you get insulted by the people who waste our money . 
  i do n't know . 
  i remember times when living in germany did n't feel like being in a gulag . 
  now i just see that our `` social dividend '' is n't payed out here because it 's flowing into a bottomless pit elsewhere . 
  there we have it . 
  you support greece with your tax money and get called a loan shark . 
  no greece wo n't kick out germany for you , england . 
  and if anybody was entitled to a grudge it 's the benevolent lender who 's money has been carelessly wasted . 
  but i 'm sure such a thinking is beneath our boys . 
  errm , only crewed spaceflights count as intospacecanship , 
  just a stereotype of * the * german politician i guess . 
  and not a bad one . 
  somehow the guy seems familiar .

  boy , you are 21 now and electrical engineer . 
  you may feel as european as you like  that 's a somewhat strange question because australia is * the * dream emigration country for * a lot * of europeans . 
  along with canada maybe . 
  what causes your identity conflict ? 
  damn sun and fucking beaches ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/smiza/history_of_europe/ ) a commented version of the cartoon . 
  they are meant to be slavic tribes and i think they are pushed by vikings into central europe . 
  from the timeline it would fit but do n't ask me why the vikings are embodied by finnballs .
