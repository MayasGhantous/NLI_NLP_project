  b\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6rk !, 
  yay !, 
  that 's [ john resig ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_resig ) , the creator of [ jquery ] ( http://jquery.com/ ) . 
  as a web developer i find it * extremely * cool to have such a celebrity here as mod . 
  i assume he built the first flair bot and is still here for tech tasks . 
  hey i was about to post that !, 
  / r/europe obviously changed the flag flair assignment to self-service recenty . 
  just kick the 69 karma and create a new account , 
  do you already know / r/polandball ? 
  no problem . 
  another thing : why do n't you get your flag , iwantmyflag ? 
  just click edit in the upper side bar , right above 50 countries , 230 languages , 731m people, 
   um . . but that 's obviously malta in the op comic . 
  but not in the comic , that thenormalguy linked above ( top of this comment tree ) . 
  for your convenience : http://i.imgur.com/fazybpd.png, 
  yay !, 
  that 's right and here 's the [ polandball tutorial ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrvre.png ) where everything is explained . 
  tanning is n't good for [ austria anyway ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wx6uq.png ) . 
  here is [ america 's revenge ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/poland_meets_the_us_states.png ) . 
  from / r/polandball, 
  this needs to be posted [ here ] ( / r/polandball ) !, 
  love this comic and here is [ america 's revenge ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/poland_meets_the_us_states.png ) . 
  from / r/polandball, 
  if anyone has the expertise for such projects , then it 's the dutch . 
  british politics has a long successful tradition of divide and rule . 
  but now , in absence of a suitable geo-strategic victim , they apply this strategy to themselves . 
  i think they should stop this self mutilation and stay in the union , 
   meaning ... * upper town * so it 's the equivalent to the name * oberhausen * in germany . 
  we have [ lots of municipalities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oberhausen_\\ ( disambiguation \\ ) ) with that name . 
  ober = upper hausen = housing , dwelling = town, 
  you need two more backslashes to escape the markdown syntax \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  it was until [ 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) . 
  the us army [ is still here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_army_installations_in_germany ) but not as occupant though . 
  not an argument , dutch vegetables do n't ever come in contact with fertile land neither \\ ^_^, 
  the fact that they still sell vegetables from holland is bizarre . 
  and this greengrocer complaining that he 's got to pay for it in advance is the pinnacle . 
  another proud greek i guess . 
   what a cynical piece of shoddy journalism . 
  legitimized ? 
  it 's just quoting riexinger , the left party guy . 
   instead of making the ladder the greeks are just making the hole deeper and happily bringing their own shovels , that they still own to the store . 
   something the european dudes would never do . 
  yeah rich european greek dudes for example . 
  yes , as `` boykott '' and the verb is `` boykottieren '' . 
  that 's a good idea but the drawing was 6 ^ th of december . 
  that was only 25 days of 2013 to make it to the top ten . 
  it 's also very unlikely that a single letter is in the top ten searches . 
  and there 's still no reason to downvote me . 
  these gender activists are overly sensitive . 
  why not ? 
  love this comic !, 
  from the exonyms for us i like ale-mania the most , 
  probably they 've heard the english word `` gay '' somewhere and as the german letter `` g '' is pronounced almost identically they 're trying to solve the mystery :d edit : wtf , why is everybody downvoting me ? 
  that 's a good theory . 
  like many other anglicisms , `` gay '' is used as synonym for the german word nowadays ( by people who think they 're cool ) . 
  germany seems to be quite interesting * deutschland * niemcy * n\u011bmecko * njema\u010dka * tyskland * vokietija * saksamaa, 
  looking at the extensive [ waterways ] ( http://www.liberte-flussreisen.de/img/karte-1-l.jpg ) in lorraine and especially around nancy , it seems really odd that they could n't keep a fair share of big industry . 
  sure a german elsass again . 
  good idea . 
  what could possibly happen  ) ) at least the open borders seem to work perfectly well for baden and elsass . 
  something i witnessed when i was in karlsruhe and baden-baden . 
  and there 's also the euroregion [ saarlorlux ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saarlorlux ) . 
  it 's a bit odd because they all suffer from the structural change resulting from the decline of mining and steel-producing industries but at least the have rich luxembourg as center . 
   to be fair , aside from agriculture there is nothing in champagne . 
  which brings us to necessities . 
  due to historical local inheritance customs in [ swabia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swabia ) the farms got smaller and smaller and people were forced to find other means of income . 
  today swabia is part of [ baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg ) , the densest area on the map in our southwest . 
  it 's * the * major dynamo for germany 's economy . 
  that 's where most car manufacturers and many high-tech companies are located . 
  so , probably champagne is just fine with agriculture and maybe lorraine has a bright future . 
  ^ ^ ^ simply ^ ^ ^ give ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ back ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ us ^ ^ ^ :p, 
  you 've embezzled ukraine , ivan !, 
  that 's a tasteless joke , give it back . 
  yes they barely scratch a living by growing ~ ~ sour ~ ~ dry wine and selling it with bubbles . 
  awesome !, 
  hahaha , tagged / u/toteshuman as `` megakarmawhore '' . 
  even the * hatis * double-typo is unchanged :d, 
   *** das *** gift i see what you did there , 
  yes , but there 's still no point in waisting resources just because you can . 
  nobody requires images in such a resolution on reddit . 
  [ k ] ( http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/dr.-who.gif ), 
  i 'm envious but i hope the broadband is really cheap for you . 
  no rocket science , right mouse click  `` inspect element '' . 
  did n't take longer than 30 seconds . 
  and it was the only thing left i could actually do on the frozen page , 
  happy europe day !, 
  something formal though . 
  could you please not put 18 images with motherfucking 4 mb each in an album ? 
  that 's about 70mb !, 
  i mean there 's absolutely no reason to upload 4128 x 3096px large images . 
  1024 x 768px would have been plenty and these could still be optimised for web usage . 
  every [ res ] ( http://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) user will be grateful if the browser page does n't freeze for minutes . 
  thank you . 
  yes , like norway . 
  ok but these are invasive species . 
  we 've got those too with raccoons and [ nandus ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nandu ) being the most prominent ones . 
  but boars should have lived on ireland at some point in the past and then got exterminated . 
  one really wonders why there are so many wild boar farms . 
  could they actually be hunting enclosures ? 
  you know where weekend `` hunters '' go and basically cut down zoo animals .
