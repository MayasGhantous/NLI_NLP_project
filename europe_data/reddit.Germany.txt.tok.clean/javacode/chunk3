  yes that 's the joke , 
  yeez , now you get downvoted too . 
  i swear it was n't me !, 
  turns out the swedish and the british have no humor at all . 
  it 's probably their sharia laws that forbid it . 
  was it planned or did it happen by accident ? 
   up until recently yes i 've read the article . 
  probably not as boars are haram ... but what am i telling a swede ? 
  allahu akb\u00f6rk :p edit : yeah go ahead and downvote me . 
  / u/brajx totally not started the stereotyping . 
  til up until recently britain has n't had wild boars since the 13th century . 
  one of the most common game animal over here . 
  [ this sign ] ( http://www.grossfachhandel.de/verkehrszeichen/10-son12_verkehrsschild_achtu/vb-101-son12vz.gif ) must be really exotic then for brits visiting the continent . 
  the third did n't fit already . 
  more would only make france civilised . 
  i think both , center left * and * center right have moved towards each other to occupy the sweet spot where they expect the best return on votes . 
  that 's at least the case in germany . 
  the cdu has clearly moved to the left and merkels policy has created an vacuum on the right that filled with old-school cdu conservatives and sucked up ultra-right-wingers in that event too . 
  the afd is the perfect example for it . 
  the founder [ bernd lucke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernd_lucke ) has been a cdu member since his youth and his party serves as forum for those who are missing traditional conservative values that have been abandoned by merkel 's new cdu . 
  worth it . 
  there was a british author too but i did n't find him . 
  the topic [ comes up ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2011/08/germany ) once in a while but i always thought it might be the base for the poo porn thing in southpark . 
  one possible explanation : there was an [ idiotic author ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alan_dundes#controversy ) who concluded razor-sharply from the fact that our favourite expletive is `` scheisse '' to a respective glitch in the german national character :d that makes him a scheissauthor in my eyes because there 's a much easier , phonetical explanation . 
  `` scheisse '' simply makes an excelent expletive . 
  it sounds nasty and it 's very versatile . 
  it 's far better than your monosyllabic favourite `` fuck '' . 
  one can pronounce `` scheisse '' in many different ways . 
  sizzle it sharply or stretch it and shout it out loud because it has two syllables . 
  and you can use it as prefix for anything that annoys you . 
  `` scheissauto '' , `` scheissmusik '' , `` scheissberkleyfolkloristikprofessor '' , whatever . 
  it 's actually `` schei ** \u00df ** e '' but not everbody knows that special character . 
  he wo n't care . 
  do you really believe this putin troll is french ? 
  yes everything russia touches turns into shit . 
   danzig was not restored lol 50 's style you say ? 
  strange , [ this is the very first image ] ( http://onebigphoto.com/uploads/2014/01/old-town-in-gdansk-poland.jpg ) you get if you image-search google for [ `` gdansk ** old town ** '' ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=danzig+altstadt&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=awqxvfgzaykyafqcgfam&amp;ved=0cagq_auoag&amp;biw=1067&amp;bih=517#tbm=isch&amp;q=gdansk+old+town&amp;imgrc=aluaxksvvjzjqm%253a%3b6gdxxc6mlmsgfm%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fonebigphoto.com%252fuploads%252f2014%252f01%252fold-town-in-gdansk-poland.jpg%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fonebigphoto.com%252fold-town-gdansk-poland%252f%3b960%3b595 ) . 
  that does n't look 50 's style to me an it 's quite a difference to what russians made of [ k\u00f6nigsberg ] ( http://www.empfangshalle.de/typo3temp/pics/a1027e2311.jpg ) . 
  and my point was made about  next time either do n't start a world war or win it . 
  which is * absurd * given the fact that russians live there and what this thread is about . 
  as if it 's normal and justified to punish architecture , infrastructue and your own people not only during communism but also 25 years after it . 
  poland is a good example how it 's done right , how they for example restaurated caringly the old town of danzig . 
  those people are n't there anymore , do n't you get that ? 
  it 's * russians * who have to live there . 
  and it 's a mess , you can hardly deny it . 
  ok you 've out-split-haired me . 
  respekt !, 
  it 's not . 
  there 's a hierachy  type | translation | purpose : -- | : -- | : -- krankenwagen | sick 's car | transport of ( stable ) patients rettungswagen | rescue car | like krankenwagen but with live saving equipment and staffed with trained paramedics notarztwagen | emergency doctor car | like rettungswagen but with an emergency doctor on board, 
  love [ australia 's ] ( http://www.passportindex.org/countries/au.png ) simplicity . 
  due to the animals it 's absolutely clear on the first glimpse which nation it is . 
  it would n't even require to have the name written out . 
  [ botswana 's ] ( http://www.passportindex.org/countries/bw.png ) is cool . 
  black with the best [ coat of arms ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/coat_of_arms_of_botswana.svg/225px-coat_of_arms_of_botswana.svg.png ) ever in gold . 
  their [ flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/flag_of_botswana.svg/225px-flag_of_botswana.svg.png ) is a real beauty too . 
  anyways , the passport power ranking is outdated . 
  in may 2014 , british , finnish , german , swedish and us citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 174 countries and territories . 
  [ ( source [ pdf ] ) ] ( https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/hp%20visa%20restrictions%20index%20140728.pdf ) . 
  since then germans also gained visa-free or evisa access to kazakhstan and india [ ( source ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_german_citizens#recent ) . 
  [ we are # 1 ] ( http://www.passportindex.org/countries/de.png ) :p, 
  love the hungarian engrish . 
  all eu countries should do satire news like that on a regular basis . 
  perfect would be a unified web format where `` correspondents '' report . 
  there 's a colour called [ prussian blue ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussian_blue ) but the [ traditional national colours ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_international_auto_racing_colors#historic_colours ) ( esp . 
  in competitions ) had france in blue and germany in white . 
  green was england and italy had red . 
    anyways , my comment was meant as a joke  ah sorry , i did n't get that . 
  well the thing with the jizz map was obviously a joke . 
  but the rest has a true core . 
    margaret thatcher immediately fell back to militaristic rhetorics  but the militaristic rhetorics are kind of normal in such situations , especially with a character like thatcher ... you start contradicting yourself . 
  let 's stop it here before we get drawn into an infinite loop , 
  margaret thatcher immediately fell back to militaristic rhetorics like `` we beat the germans twice , and now they 're back '' . 
  just saying . 
  anyways , my comment was meant as a joke along the lines of [ sir archibald mapsalot iii ] ( http://media.mtvnservices.com/player/prime/mediaplayerprime.2.5.7.swf?uri=mgid:cms:item:comedycentral.com:428829&amp;type=normal&amp;ref=none&amp;geo=de&amp;group=entertainment&amp;network=none&amp;device=other&amp;config_url=http%3a%2f%2fmedia.mtvnservices.com%2fpmt-arc%2fe1%2fplayers%2fmgid%3acms%3aitem%3acomedycentral.com%3a%2fconfig.xml%3furi%3dmgid%3acms%3aitem%3acomedycentral.com%3a428829%26type%3dnormal%26ref%3dnone%26geo%3dde%26group%3dentertainment%26network%3dnone%26device%3dother ) and this comic http://i.imgur.com/d39qyca.png . 
   as long as it would never get powerful enough again to threaten them . 
  well and what did that mean in the end ? 
  the partition of germany . 
  drawing borders . 
  you ca n't deny that they were n't at least envolved . 
  and if you remember how vigorously margaret thatcher was opposed to the german reunification , you know that they really enjoyed it . 
  almost every today 's and former conflict and civil war in the world is rooted in shitty borders drawn by ignorant jerks in whitechapel during the british empire . 
  looks like jerk-off material for brits . 
  a jizz map . 
  these pervs really enjoy drawing borders . 
  pakistan , india , nepal , bangladesh , iraq , israel and the list goes on and on . 
  not at all . 
  it 's nice . 
  you can go upstairs , see the sea and shop duty free . 
  ah , glorious the [ vogelfluglinie ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vogelfluglinie ) !, 
   who says they would leave the common market ? 
  well that 's how i understood the topic . 
  and it appears odd to me to keep all the rules but to give up on the right to have say when they 're defined . 
  well the whole conflict started when ukraine intended to join the eu . 
  it 's not a direct confrontation but poor ukraine is a pawn on vladi 's chessboard in his match against the eu . 
  you are the dick because you ca n't read . 
  i asked / u/winkwinknudge _ nudge if he still would n't care what russia wants if it came out that russia meddles in uk politics by sponsoring eu-sceptics . 
  nevertheless , i would n't be surprised if it came out that ukip takes money from russia . 
  or another right-wing group . 
  well a word is missing in the title but all commenters so far seem to agree that it 's about the uk * leaving the eu * . 
  of course would the economic area be weakend if the common market was reduced by britain .
