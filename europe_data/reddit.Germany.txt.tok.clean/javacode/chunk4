  it would still weaken the eu 's economic power ; and britain 's too of course . 
  putin intends to play us out against each others and to divide us . 
  where exactly do i accuse someone ? 
  is something wrong with my english grammar or is the concept of subjunctive unknown to you ? 
  it 's not out of this world to assume that it 's posssible . 
  many right-wing groups in europe are under suspicion and iirc did france 's fn receive money from moscow . 
  just recently did russia invite right-wingers and nazis to a conference in st. petersburg and i would n't be surprised at all if it came out that pegida or the afd in germany were on moscow 's paylist . 
  so why not in the uk too ? 
   though i do n't see what advantage the uk leaving would have for russia . 
    little . 
  are you kidding ? 
  the uk is one of the largest economies in the eu . 
  a weakend eu would definitively be in russia 's interest , at least in putin 's narrow mind . 
   could n't really care less what russia wants . 
  what if there were right-wing groups receiving money from russia for advocating a split-up ? 
  the french are more family-oriented , in the south more so than in the north but altogether more than in germany . 
  france is centralized , with paris being the one main center while germany is federally organised . 
  we have way more metropolian areas . 
  in our historical patchwork of independant states , regional political , commercial and cultural centers grew parallel . 
  that 's why our infrastructure is more like a mesh of roads and railroad tracks while france 's is more astrally organised and oriented to paris . 
  from that you can deduct a lot in terms of lifestyle and also explain our industrial [ mittelstand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mittelstand ) model . 
   outgoing , fun loving sorry but that sounds horribly american  if you come as a tourist do n't expect anyone waiting for you with open arms and especially not in paris . 
  paris is not some sort of disney land , daytona beach or holiday resort . 
  oversea visitors often have a misty-eyed , romanticised idea of paris as the `` city of love '' and are horribly disappointed that it 's a very busy city full of hard-working people , many of them commuters , who could n't care less about your presence . 
  there 's even a psychological disorder called [ paris syndrome ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ) that shows up in some when anticipation clashes harshly with reality . 
  both germans and french are rather reserved . 
  many mistake that as unfriendlyness but it 's usually discretion and respect for your privacy . 
  it 's you who has to be outgoing . 
  do n't expect to be entertained . 
  get away 30-50km from major airports and talk to people in pubs and in cafes and you 'll see that many will be happy to practise their english . 
  haha they got me until 0:52 . 
  nice one . 
  absolutely . 
  who knows what he has in his portfolio . 
  some crazy bets on greece 's near future maybe ? 
  * ostracisation by exaggerated politeness * deliberate obfuscation in the nomenclature of comestibles * unprussian laisser-faire ( passt scho ), 
  me too, 
  thanks , good to know !, 
  absolutely . 
  why russia always * has * to be shit ? 
  i think it 's because during his education as a kgb officer , young vladi was brainwashed to such an extend , that senior vladimir putin still thinks something is wrong when he is n't acting like a complete asshole . 
  greece should join . 
  muhaha !, 
   in southern and central england ... but not in all of england . 
  altogether the germanic ancestor group with 30 % seems to be the largest . 
  that 's how i understood it at least . 
  it 's just the lights that `` look '' derpy . 
  apart from that is the thing is pretty rad . 
   but you reap what you sow . 
  even if you accept that , and most germans do , it 's still disgusting what the russians made of k\u00f6nigsberg . 
  it 's not germans , it 's * russians * who have to live there in what was once one of the most beautiful town in the baltics . 
  and look at it now . 
  this thread is about what places look like after 70 years of russian occupation and what the russians made of k\u00f6nigsberg in ** 70 fucking years after ww2 ** is indeed disgusting . 
  yes , why ? 
  please elaborate . 
  like air pollution ? 
  squandering is never a virtue . 
  you might perceive it as affordable but oil is not abudant and wars are fought for the sole purpose to guarantee future supply . 
  not to speak of the dependency to oil producing states one betakes into . 
  weird , weird dictatorships that only persist because of the oil . 
  it 's only logical to go away from oil . 
  if the united states were your home instead of germany : http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/de/us sweden : http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/se/us finland : http://www.ifitweremyhome.com/compare/fi/us just `` making more money '' is n't everything . 
  there 's more to a livable state than that , things like social justice , health insurance , public safety , etc. 
  hehe we also call it shield-toad and land-shield-toad , schildkr\u00f6te and landschildkr\u00f6te . 
  the abiltiy to create names for new things on the fly in germanic languages is clearly of advantage and can even serve for jokes . 
  nevertheless , in the case of * stridsvagn * your forefathers obviously did n't deem it necessary to create a new word for tanks and that 's what makes it sound so special for me as german . 
  special as in badass , cool , archaic , martial if you know what i mean . 
  like vikings rampaging on a 1000 year old chariot drawn by bears through snowy woods  panzerkampfwagen on the other hand is a constructed term crafted by military nomenclature rules . 
  it may be precise but it has a bureaucratic touch to it . 
  nobody uses it colloquially , it 's shortened to panzer . 
  but i can see that it sounds badass for foreigners . 
  ms merkel should n't be spared for her lack of spine . 
  except that it does n't bear much similarity to * stridsvagn * , yes :p, 
  best swedisch military word is * stridsvagn * for tank . 
  it 's completely clear in german what 's meant , except that we use * streitwagen * for antique ben hur style chariots only . 
  funniest thing i 've seen today !, 
  nice try , but if one looks at the [ ireland 's most wanted ] ( http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/\\ ( requestingcountry \\ ) / 199 / \\ ( current_age_maxi \\ ) / 100 / \\ ( search \\ ) / 1 ) though , i 'd prefer your problems even over [ ours ] ( http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/\\ ( requestingcountry \\ ) / 155 / \\ ( current_age_maxi \\ ) / 100 / \\ ( search \\ ) / 1 ) . 
  dunno , maybe not . 
  so proud about my country right now : \u00b4 ] the only thing that needs to be reversed is the smoking ban in pubs and we are great again . 
  bremen - bremer ( not bremener ) hannover - hannoveraner, 
  except that we germans have a letter for it : ` \u00df ` , the sz , or esszett . 
  dreaming of ode to joy to be played on a major international sports event one day with a countdown displayed on the arena screen for the audience to mark the exact point when to set in with the choir after a rather long instruments-only intro . 
  even longer than in the italian anthem . 
  thanks , they should have made this `` tongue '' catholic green too . 
  still , the map sucks altogether . 
  how comes that cultures that care the least about religions are grouped as `` protestant europe '' , a religious unifier out of all thinkable attributes ? 
  and why are all these `` protestant '' scandinavian countries in the leaders quarter when they are actually matronizing nanny states ? 
  having a beer without paying your ass off or getting shunned is a form of self expression too . 
  and do n't get me started with freedom of speech . 
  must be toasty to be a lord . 
  apart from the coat some even have to wear a wig it seems . 
  and cuddly . 
  really i do n't envy them , i 'd get claustrophobic . 
  well ok , now as you say it i found it . 
  in * latin america * . 
  this map sucks . 
  thanks anyways . 
  \\  catholic europe \\  \\  italy and poland missing, 
  secondary . 
  what matters is that the [ big polluters ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/co2-1990-2012.svg ) reduce their emissions .
