  and regarding the eu , that means germany in the first place , followed by uk , italy and france . 
  also , the article obviously doubts its own headline . 
   the question is whether poland will choose the paris talks to re-emphasize its opposition to eu policy . 
  i for one find it hard to believe that the new polish government is really going to make its mark and intends to profile itself as climate change denier on the conference . 
  i * knew * that would be here . 
  came here to praise the show . 
  absolutely worthwhile watching !, 
  hehehe !, 
  all just rumors so far . 
  no official statements yet . 
  the current rumor is that there 's explosives in an ambulance . 
  [ engrish can be glorious ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tsjy7kk.png ) . 
  the second to last frame might be the best dialogue ever written in engrish . 
  that 's an english * were * . 
  * wahren * is either * keep/preserve * or the adjective * true/genuine * in plural . 
  in contrast to the dulcet euphony of * russian * . 
  sure dude !, 
  it 's not only in german , you 'll encounter the same issues in most other languages as well . 
  that 's the point i was trying to make . 
  of course , there 's variations on how to pronounce vowels in all languages but somehow the english alphabet has turned the vowels completely upside down . 
  disregard all of the weirdness , english has one inestimable advantage . 
  the ease of grammatical declinination and conjugation . 
  compare the word endings in [ this ] ( http://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-german-verb-simplifizieren.html ) to [ that ] ( http://conjugator.reverso.net/conjugation-english-verb-simplify.html ) . 
  the pronounciation of the vovels differs significantly from most other alphabets . 
  a is almost like an e in italian , e is pretty exactly an i in german , i is more like an ai or an ei , u is an a in words like * fun * or * bun * . 
  they 'd be written * fan * and * ban * on the continent . 
  one thing i 've noticed when coming back to germany , pedestrians do n't stand in your way somehow in busy walking areas and public places like train stations or airports . 
  they do n't obstruct `` critical junctions '' but proactively keep the traffic flowing . 
  out of common sense . 
  i hate to say it , but the only people who tend to occupy these `` critical junctions '' are older turkish women in traditional garb . 
  and i wonder if that 's their way , probably subconsciously , to have more contact to society , in a literal sense . 
  but , but vitamines denaturate if you heat them . 
  still not sure if you 're not just kidding . 
  me too but i ca n't remember to have seen them at lidl . 
  btw . 
  [ iglo spinach with gorgonzola ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rnh0kpg.png ) is a fullblown pasta sauce too . 
  with penne rigate , yumm !, 
  no question , yet such an idea appears extremely cynical in the light of the arson attacks that happened back then too . 
  not an expert but i think yes , on top of the federal laws , the local authorities have influence on the materials of choice . 
  i remember a posse from the 90s that the state of hamburg has n't allowed a single wooden building since the [ great fire of hamburg ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburger_brand ) . 
  and the first wooden building they planned since then was , guess what ? 
  * a refugee center !, 
   fry the vitamin c until it gets hot wtf , why ? 
  not sure if you 're serious . 
  [ savoy cabbage + cream ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gf73nre.jpg ) \\ + chicken strips \\ + white wine = great pasta sauce . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's esp . 
  an initiative by a large german media group around [ axel springer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axel_springer_se ) , trying to charge google for linking to their newspapers in google news . 
  this would be the death of the web and reddit would be among the first fatalities . 
  paywall . 
  they just hate / u/dclauzel because he 's the robespiere of / r/europe . 
  knowing in advance which dessert you 'd like from the menu ough ough grand fauxpas , tss tss . 
  they 're considered a deathtrap by law :d, 
  yes it 's mainz and no , i 've never heard that rhyme . 
  nevertheless french history is still present , with many old clubs wearing french uniforms during carnival . 
  in this context [ elferr\u00e4te ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elferrat#the_eleven_in_the_elferrat ) still exist . 
  they were a form of civil rights movement in disguise ( literally ) after the french mayence got the german mainz again . 
  elferrat means `` council of eleven '' , eleven is `` elf '' in german but elf stood for egalit\u00e9 , libert\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 . 
  they took the jester 's licence during carnival to express their political agenda . 
  apart from that a street name comes to my mind right now . 
  and on the other side of the rhine is a [ germania monument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niederwalddenkmal ) that 's reputed to be made of french cannons \\ ^ _ \\ ^, 
  it has a chapter about my home town , woohoo !, 
  agent provocateur much ? 
  the problem is , that all comes at a hefty price . 
  a chunky part of ukraine that is . 
  yes it is , you just have the wrong president . 
  the first working programmable , fully automatic digital [ computer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/z3_\\ ( computer \\ ) ) was build by a german . 
   germans and other europeans love america 's national parks well you need * some * reason . 
  since many years , if not decades , i 'm still planning a visit and end up with national parks as the best theme . 
  due to its size and variety , i find the us extremely hard to approach . 
  i always wanted to go there but i end up spoilt for choice somehow and go elsewhere . 
  well , i deliberatly used the word * authenticity * and not * looks * . 
  if it 's based on an actual historic ruin and was refurbished it 's still more interesting than a fairy-tale castle because its genuine purpose is comprehensible . 
  disregard the reconstructed parts , it 's still in an strategic location . 
  a slighting for exanple and the subsequent decay only add to its history . 
  say nothing against sncf dude !, 
  far better than db imo . 
  do n't necessarily agree . 
  if an old castle has been inhabited over centuries and was extended bit by bit , it only adds to its authenticy . 
  but nevertheless , we 've got abadoned ruins too . 
  yes it 's authentic . 
  have n't been there though . 
  the both mentioned ones where the first two that came to my mind . 
  there 's real castles all over germany , yet the most visited one by foreign tourists is this fantasy retro hut from 1892 . 
  [ neuschwanstein ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/schloss_neuschwanstein_2013.jpg/1024px-schloss_neuschwanstein_2013.jpg ) is not considered a real castle . 
  germans rather visit authentic places like [ eltz ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/burg_eltz_hdr.jpg/1024px-burg_eltz_hdr.jpg ) or [ rheinstein ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/rheinstein.jpg/450px-rheinstein.jpg ) and the likes . 
  yeah , let 's take britain 's liquidation of its car industry as shining example . 
   that is n't to say that the media is giving a balanced view of the situation in the uk yeah , maybe it 's one of the downsides of english being the lingua franca , that foreign readers get an distorted view of uk 's society . 
  and reddit mostly linking the most sensational derailments might attribute to that too . 
  probably a bit like unintentionally eavesdropping the neighbours domestic quarrels . 
  other foreign newpapers you 'd have to translate first . 
  inwards in private homes , outwards in public buildings as an emergency evacuation measure . 
  windows have to open inwards by law to prevent accidents . 
  no 3 appears to me as the strongest point . 
  to me the british newspapers , with the exception of the guardian , come across as totally nuts , pushing an extreme conservative and nationalist agenda . 
  and list is missing one thing : scapegoating the eu to push unpopular legislation . 
  they are doing it here too , `` sorry , that 's an eu directive we 've go to comply to '' but not so often as in the uk i guess . 
  yes but the dominant , right eye is n't suddenly gone just because you 're shifting gears . 
  nobody is looking to the gearstick when doing it .
