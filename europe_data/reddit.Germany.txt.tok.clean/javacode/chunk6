  implausible . 
  as if one eye turned blind while shifting gears . 
   i think the same is true for germany . 
  our policy on refugees was for the longest time based on what made us look good , not what actually is good . 
  definitively . 
  merkel 's announcement welcoming immigrants was motivated by nothing else than drowning out pegida/hogeda/etc . 
  protests because they might shed a bad light on germany inc. ^ tm . 
  kind of agree , the grand coalition has served us well but now the parties should re-position themselves and work out a clearer political profile again . 
  our country is basically void of any parlamentary opposition . 
  it 's unbelievable that merkel 's cdu is a conservative party . 
  its move to the left created a political no man 's land on its right . 
  and this no man 's land is filling more and more with people who do n't feel ideologically covered anymore . 
  it 's a mistake to simply label them as extreme right and ignore them . 
  the popping up new right parties are merkel 's own fault . 
  i think germany needs new elections . 
  the grand coalition is becoming more and more damaging for our democracy . 
  yes indeed as a german i have . 
   did nazi that coming , do n't mention the war , etc. , etc. 
  it 's the same jokes told over and over again . 
  that , and fact that the brits embarrassingly tend to think their humor is superior as a national character trait , just because they have some good comedians . 
  hmm , you 're right , that 's the oldest joke in the book and very common here in situations when it comes to signing documents . 
  however , that does n't make british re-telling-jokes-humour any better and kind of proves my point . 
  oh i like mr. bean and monty python , my point is : is it really worth such a big headline if a random person comes up with something original ? 
  ( instead of re-telling old jokes , something brits usually do ), 
  ok , so a soldier gave a witty reply . 
  #make a headline , at least 46pt large !!!, 
  on a sidenote , is british humour really as good as the brits think ? 
  i mean in effect , all they do is re-telling old jokes , mainly . 
  he 's one of * them * !, 
  more like surprise [ protektorat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protectorate_of_bohemia_and_moravia ) . 
  it does n't make any sense to list them at all then . 
  haha ok , added * aggressive * . 
  please stop linking drinking and smoking to aggressive behaviour . 
  you make it look like drinking unavoidably caused troubles . 
  that 's like linking low pork consume to terrorism . 
  so we basically think the same . 
  except that i 'd really enjoy the irony to see a 3 ^ rd wave feminist and diversity officer getting convicted for hate-speech . 
  it would send an important signal in my opinion . 
  disagree . 
  if you take gender equality seriously , you can not let that pass . 
  women are not second class citizen and it 's not a good idea to fall back to a society where their opinion does n't count or is regarded as irrelevant . 
  where they 're treated like children or property . 
  and that also means that they have to be held accountable for their wrongdoings , equal to men . 
  she 's calling for genocide . 
  i do n't think it 's ridiculous to make her accountable for that . 
  that 's so shortsighted that ca n't find a funny response , sorry . 
  those who fail to learn from history are doomed to retweet it . 
  k. i 'll talk to sweden in the meanwhile urging her to give up neutrality . 
  true unfortunately . 
  yes . 
  next up : [ thirty years ' war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war ) ii . 
  yes he is kill . 
  wow !, 
  \\* yawn \\* the final storage of nuclear waste is still not solved . 
  it 's extremely dangerous over an uncontrollable period in the future . 
  disagree . 
  electric cars are powered by nuclear energy in the end . 
  how 's that any better until a large scale coverage of renewable energy exists ? 
  that levels out in the course of centuries , 
  let 's face it , we are used to this since thousands of years . 
  germany has always been a hub of cultures and not a geographical pocket where some ur-germans bred , isolated from the world . 
  in the end they 've all integrated . 
  some faster some slower . 
  we can wait . 
  it 's just hair splitting in my opinion . 
  the court will amend that an act like the brexit is too severe to be executed without parliamentary vote . 
  british comedy . 
  you have no idea how funny it is for bystanders to watch you clowns fooling around with this brexit thing . 
  absolutely not an expert but the us president has a lot of a monarch because at the time the system was thought up it was totally normal to have a king as head of state . 
  oops i just realized that i totally forgot about switzerland . 
  embarrassing . 
  so the the us president is probably more like the direct replacement to the british king then . 
  k , thanks koleye !, 
  so it 's europe 's oldest then ( continously existing ) . 
  may i remind you that it was tsipras ' declared will to stay ? 
  [ please read this ] ( / r/europe/comments / 5blj6t/farage _ to_lead_100000strong_march_on_supreme / d9pkcir / ) . 
  and i would n't mind at all if paul dacre would be put on trial for that cover recently . 
  first off , [ please read this ] ( / r/europe/comments / 5blj6t/farage _ to_lead_100000strong_march_on_supreme / d9pkcir / ) . 
  i 've misinterpreted the comment . 
  given this context , what 's your point ? 
  please elaborate . 
  is britain not a democracy ? 
  or is not the oldest ( continously existing ) democracy ? 
  and who 's criticism is it ? 
  farage 's or / u/tntx74 ? 
   i 'm not saying uk is not democracy . 
  i 'm saying what farage says and does is what communists and fascists did . 
  sorry i completely misread your text . 
  i interpreted it as if you were calling the eu , and thus britain ( still ) being part of it , a `` fascist democracy '' . 
  but you were only missing an `` a '' between `` fascist ( or communist ) '' and `` democracy '' . 
   where i have seen these ? 
  ah , yea , my childhood in czechoslovak socialist republic and will of proletariat to cover everything regime wanted to do ... 
  comparing the worlds oldest democracy with a left-authoritarian regime . 
  good job , good job !, 
  edit : just to give you a hint , farage would 've been put to jail for thought-crimes in the \u010cssr , if not killed . 
  the very fact that he can voice his opinion proves the opposite . 
  there 's more relationships than just married couples but anyways , thanks for the read . 
  let 's see what happens . 
  should there be any surprise in the expected outcome , and trump wins , i 'm pretty sure the reason will be found exactly here . 
  interesting .
