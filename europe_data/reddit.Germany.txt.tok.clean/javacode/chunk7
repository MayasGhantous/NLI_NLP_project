  care to provide me with a source/link ? 
  not trying to annoy you but because it genuinely interests me . 
  same here . 
  because the muricans are like that , willing to give the other party a turn . 
  even if they ca n't afford it . 
  because the old same same has lost momentum . 
  the biggest mistake clinton has made though was to dumb it down to a gender issue by playing the women 's card too often . 
  the fewest men who want to have peace and sex in their relationships would ever publicly admit to vote for trump . 
  but in the polling booth they 'll get their revenge for every shit 3rd wave feminists have said recently , and vote for trump with a smirk on their face . 
  we will never see a merkelreich anyhow . 
  the uk yellow press might keep its favourite scapegoats though . 
  if he tries milana immediately runs and takes cover . 
  self-deprecating humour is a virtue , dude . 
  i doubt trump will ever be able to rise to such a stage of self-deprecating humour . 
  probably on the day the cows come home , or respectively , the day brexit happens . 
  yes that 's how i see it too . 
  in my opinion the uk government has started a campaign to break it gently to the public that brexit * might * never come and takes it by its pride stressing the legendary british humor . 
  first hawking [ joking about it ] ( https://redd.it/5avld7 ) under the pretext of a `` pride of britain award '' with may standing next to him . 
  now boris at an award donated by the spectator , nothing less but * the * reference publication of conservative intellectuals . 
  i mean , out of all possible listeners he makes that `` slip '' to people who 've made reading between the lines of political speeches their profession  ), 
  rofl , this guy is actually really funny . 
  was a bit skeptic at first . 
  exactly my thoughts first , but a voice software in english with german accent ? 
  unlikely . 
  it 's the same speaker i guess . 
   was n't me mate oh ok , sorry !, 
  the best way to fight brexit is helping to procrastinate it . 
  merkel is a veritable master in doing nothing . 
  that 's the true secret behind her success . 
  doing nothing keeps the failure ratio low and nobody wants change anyways . 
  she surely could give may some valuable tips . 
  oh come on , i 'm not trying to promote the model railway ~ ~ , why the downvote ~ ~ ? 
  do n't you agree that the voice is very similar ? 
  watched the [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=admzriyrcue ) and the narrative style and voice strongly reminded me of something . 
  after a while i knew what it was . 
  tada !, 
  now compare it to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ackmg3y64_s )  ) ) * coincidence ? 
  makes me wonder what `` brexit means brexit '' actually means then . 
  in the second to last paragraph the author finally makes the point that `` brexit '' only '' ** may ** mean brexit in westminster '' . 
  so , by the logic of the article and considering that theresa may is a well-brought-up british lady , this actually means that `` brexit does ** not ** mean brexit '' , do i get this right ? 
  \\ + tight coupling of economy and government . 
  putin is basically owner and manager of a huge oil and gas company called russia . 
  too stupid to talk into a microphone . 
  because it 's pretty obvious what game is played by the uk government . 
  they 'll drag it like a chewing gum , to st. neverever 's day ( like we say in my country ) in the hope for better weather . 
  just look who you 've got there , a parliament where about 70 % are against a brexit , a pm who did n't want it , public officers who worked towards an integration with the eu their whole careers only to see their llifetime achievements attacked by a non-binding plebiscite . 
  they 'll rather redefine what `` brexit '' * actually * stands for and report of `` progress despite tough negotiations '' for the next 43 years because `` brexit means brexit '' actually does n't mean much . 
  it 's an equation like `` x = x '' or `` apples are apples '' , void of any deeper meaning . 
  thanks !, 
   bitburger is disgusting , unless you love extreme bitter aftertaste hehe , i actually do . 
  hops , hops , hops !, 
  bitb ** ou ** rger ? 
  i think bitburg is pretty close . 
  kidding aside , which beers are it ? 
  thanks !, 
  any recommendations ? 
  any recommendations ? 
  ca n't remember to have ever seen a wine from luxembourg . 
  what 's to recommend ? 
  when the wall came down many russian soldiers were selling their guns . 
  must be a reference to the voltorb pok\u00e9mon . 
  it 's a shame that you putin bloggers seem to hide behind german usernames now . 
  idk , the automoderator config is n't public but having rt as unreliable source is a classification i agree upon . 
  it 's a goddamn propaganda machine after all . 
  in case of a livestream the label does n't make sense of course . 
  it 's rt. 
  the labeling must be automated . 
  classic job for / u/automoderator . 
  intelligent people like him are most likely to be remainers . 
  the referendum was actually an iq test and britain failed it . 
  ah ok , thanks !, 
  haha the famous british humor , milord deems to crack good old colonialist jokes . 
   revert back to the punt * punt * ? 
  what 's that , the medieval name of the pound ? 
  many exonyms much historical significance . 
  not sure , of foreign media i can only read english news properly . 
  some greek newspaper covers i 've seen suggest that the greeks do it too though  in germany they certainly would n't style her in such a way as some kind of absolute monarch . 
  sure they keep headlines short but it 's always implied that it 's about her position within eu talks . 
  happy national day sounds weird . 
  you know how it 's meant . 
  absolutely . 
  and i doubt she wants to decide it alone . 
  these newspapers should really stop to style her as some sort of `` queen of the eu '' . 
  it 's even quoted that she said that it 's the competence of all 27 member states . 
  the headline is simply rubbish . 
  happy birthday france !, 
  yes here you go : https://redd.it/4rcjy4 . 
  good job op !, 
  i 'd love to see more of these . 
  this 4th reich bullshit must be the cheapest propaganda slogan ever , especially since your 4th reich has done nothing wrong . 
  you know who 's getting a not democratically elected premier now ? 
  you are !, 
  at least she 's is democratically elected , mother theresa is not . 
  inb4 mother theresa :p, 
  now the brexiting arsonist brats need a mother figure to fix the mess they 've caused . 
  definitively downgeloaded like in heruntergeladen . 
   english starts to use telecharged it 's not common at all , it 's just me fooling around . 
   in french i ... use download\u00e9 we use download and other computer-related american words too in german . 
  it 's getting really scary when the rules for past tense ( participle ii ) are applied : * down * ge * loaded * * ange * klickt ( clicked * on * ) * * ge * booted , * ge * rebooted * etc. 
  haha , awesome surprise !,
