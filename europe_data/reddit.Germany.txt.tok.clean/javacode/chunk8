  my posting was rather meant as light-hearted banter but this made my day !, 
  t\u00e9l\u00e9charged the pdf fiche and foresee to look into it more deeply . 
  ^ ^ love ^ ^ it !, 
  not scho emousshion soo . 
  jeez you really have no humor , typical english . 
  haha hewent zeen zat one in a long time . 
  or `` antiquated shit spelling '' for be and simply `` english '' for ae . 
  sorry but ae is based on the very same roots - d'uh - , nevertheless the spelling * way * more intuitive . 
  with the exception of the ** z ** in ** organize ** every single point shows that ae is better . 
  only a severe cold can make a language sound like dutch . 
  totally open for it . 
  first having a big wishlist were every party adds its ideas and then boil it down to the b\u00e4r minimum . 
  we ca n't allau a malevolent forein pauer to dict\u00e4t aur grammar and orthografie . 
  and i 'm also aiming at the cringe eff\u00e4kt , nau zat the englisch woted for brexit , they have to suffer on every level . 
  l\u00e4nguage is a m\u00e4jor provider for national identity , we 've got to use tactics of acustical attrition . 
  agree , we just should develop our own flavor , european english . 
  as a start we should make ae the standard and neglect be with all its antiquated bullshit , especially in spelling . 
  and upon that we should allow an own dialect to grow , ze glorius ee , anarchic at first , mor leik engrish until a new standard forms . 
  i like all kinds of cheese , also stinky ones but the best cheese in the world - since childhood - is [ boursin ] ( http://peppermintbliss.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/boursin-cheese.jpg ) . 
   also , you use the word `` moron '' a lot . 
  usually i do n't , it was just in this discussion 2 times within a very short period of time . 
  i find people who demand a source obnoxious , especially if they do n't back their statements with sources either . 
  where are we after all ? 
  at university , defending our doctor titles in linguistics or what ? 
  to your second point , in essence i answered that in [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4izao3/eu_document_admonishes_euus_english_advocates/d32wrxl ) . 
   it 's not only about spelling and loanwords but also about the * way * to say things . 
  about phrases , figures of speech and metaphors . 
   of course , ae also influences be , with books , movies , etc. 
  so that both are less apart again . 
  but i really think the eu should n't tie itself to old fashioned be . 
  as i said , such an endevor is absurd . 
  we , the continental europeans , will never learn it like native englishmen and the result will be a fork very much like ae anyways . 
  and there 's no reason to try in case of a brexit . 
   standard american ** phrases ** originating in the yiddish speaking community include : * get lost , what 's up , i should worry , i should live so long , i need it like a hole in the head , you do n't know from nothin ' , pardon the expression , enjoy * . 
  from 1675-1725 the quakers , or society of friends , migrated from the north midlands of england and wales to the delaware valley . 
  their speechways -- mixed with those of later german and swedish immigrants -- gave rise to the distinctive band of dialects spoken in parts of pennsylvania and new jersey . 
   ...  contributions to american english : ** great number of euphemisms . 
  ** from the same page and proves my point that it 's not only about spelling and loanwords but also about the * way * to say things . 
  about phrases , figures of speech and metaphors . 
  of course , ae also influences be , with books , movies , etc. 
  so that both are less apart again .

  and there 's no reason to try in case of a brexit . 
  for a change , why do n't * you * start providing sources for * your * claims ? 
  btw . 
  i think indian english is disgusting :p, 
   the use of english in the united states is a result of british colonization of the americas . 
  the first wave of english-speaking settlers arrived in north america during the 17th century , followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries . 
  ** since then , american english has been influenced by the languages of west africa , the native american population , german , dutch , irish , spanish , and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the united states . 
  ** [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_english ) here you have your fucking source , next time search for yourself . 
  only a moron would believe that one single man can change a language and that languages develop without foreign influence . 
  languages are `` living things '' .

  you are a complete moron if you think that languages develop without foreign influences . 
  where do words like frolicking , delicatessen , hinterland and kindergarten come from for example ? 
  and those are just a few german ones that came to my mind instantly , i 'm sure there tons of others from other cultures . 
  yeah sure , the first european settlers suddenly spoke minnesotan dialect the minute they arrived in minnesota in the 18 ^ th century . 
  out of the blue . 
  same in texas with texan and elsewhere too . 
  yawn , of course not , prefix a `` different '' to both points . 
  seriously , where are your pains ? 
  are you out for a sophisticated academic discourse about linguistics ? 
  ca n't help you with that , sorry . 
  do you think i find be inferior per se ? 
  i absolutely do n't , it 's just that ae would be better for the eu in my opinion . 
  it 's only logical , do n't need to source that . 
  americans * are * easier to understand for me as a foreigner . 
  also in the context of which language to use by european non-brits , it 's absurd to insist on pure be . 
  they 'll never learn it like a native and the result will be something like ae anyways . 
  \\ + metaphhors \\ + figures of speech, 
  no it 's * verbicide * . 
  it 's not a roof but a ceiling and it 's just a provincial europe museum * in * schengen not the european schengen museum . 
  disagree . 
  american english has removed a lot of oddities from british english not only in regards of spelling . 
  and it 's much better to understand . 
  not that it sounds nicer though , that 's debatable  american english is the result of millions of immigrants from all over the world expressing themselves in a language that 's not their mother tongue . 
  that has polished off all the nonsense and added new ways to bring topics to the point , intelligible to all . 
  it 's kind of comparable to music . 
  german pop for example will hardly ever exceed oompah-ta complexity due to lack of foreign influence while in america jazz , rhythm & bues , etc. 
  developed . 
  and in this sense british english is a medival tune or a brass band . 
  yes , i see you edited your initial comment , now it reads much more constructive . 
  seems like me and a few others were preaching to the choir . 
  the relation between the hre and the distribution of printing presses makes much sense . 
  good point . 
  there 's some sort of [ continuity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_germany ) though , you ca n't deny . 
  and the hre was called holy roman empire * of the german nation * from the c15th on . 
  gib cheap whisky !, 
  we should pay it , to create a precedent . 
  only to fuck with the former big colonial empires and especially those who brexit :p, 
  no need to read between the lines in a spiegel article . 
  that was surprisingly entertaining to watch . 
  excellent pun !, 
  \\* fruit knifes , little hoity-toity fruit knifes . 
  anyways , good observation , their choice of cutlery is really the icing on the cake in this photo .
