  at least it contains one vowel , 
  many exonyms much honour . 
  but yeah , the lack of a single state to represent the nation certainly has attributed to it .

  that 's how you distract from the fact that your party failed to get a second seat in parlament in the [ stoke-on-trent central byelection ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stoke-on-trent_central_by-election,_2017 ) yesterday .

   today , after a ruling of the federal constitutional court in 1994 the term `` defence '' has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of germany , but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention , or more broadly as guarding the security of germany anywhere in the world . 
  [ 35 ] according to the definition given by former defence minister struck , it may be necessary to defend germany even at the hindu kush . 
  this requires the bundeswehr to take part in operations outside of the borders of germany , as part of nato or the european union and ** mandated by the un ** .

  well then absolutely nobody in france has a reason to vote for her . 
  that 's good . 
   nevertheless , a le pen victory ca n't be ruled out and would spark a capital flight from france and peripheral euro nations such as italy , commerzbank ag says .

   france must reopen talks with russia , centrist presidential candidate emmanuel macron told journalists on wednesday . 
  he said russia must play a decisive role in ending the conflict in syria , and that the removal of syrian president bashar al-assad can not be a prior condition to end the war . 
  the former economy minister also favours renewed peace talks on ukraine in order to gradually diminish sanctions against russia , ap reported .

  he 's pro eu , that 's why i hope he wins .
