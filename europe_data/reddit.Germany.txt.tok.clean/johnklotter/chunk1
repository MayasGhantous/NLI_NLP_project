we did master the art of bread and beer making though, 
  nothing to worry about except climate change i guess . . 
  i reserve the right to have onions . 
  same in german . 
  i do n't even know if you could buy something like this in germany . . 
  i think he meant b\u00f6hmermann 's rammstein-like song [ be deutsch !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqkv5ctuoy ), 
  his other songs are good as well , e.g. 
  [ baby got laugengeb\u00e4ck ( pop ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysaqtdc-y2g ) about germanys new usp , [ be deutsch !, 
  ( rammstein-like ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqkv5ctuoy ) after the refugee crisis or the [ german history of rap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iksa41ly1m8 ), 
  agree with your thoughts . 
  one of the main principles ( and benefits ) of the eu is the free transfer of labour , money etc. 
  so it should n't make a difference where you bought it in the eu . 
  go contact someone about this . 
  do n't just buy it somewhere else , please report this kind of business . 
   it was via some twitter application . 
  `` twitter counter '' was the one ( [ see here ] ( https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/twitter-counter-hacked/ ) ) . 
  it 's reddit . 
  of course it will be . 
  yeah but why should the state of georgia be mentioned in / r/europe ? 
  it would n't solve trumps problem that us products are not as competitive as european products . 
  therefore his base is hurt ( indirectly , with the status quo ) . 
   is pushing a narrative god i hate that word, 
  i think this is most likely for companies with lots of jobs and that rely on exporting to the us . 
  i put a translation of the main points of the article somewhere here in the comments , 
  why not both ? 
   `` pray for the best , prepare for the worst '' i think this is what they are doing , but only instead of `` praying '' trying to reason with the us . 
  the article states that those are only preparations if it comes to the 20 % import tax . 
  noone here wants to start any kind of trade war . . 
   i do n't like the use of the word war because ... 
  yes , i agree , it is not the best choice of words and also not the best possible headline . 
  it makes it sound like the eu is an aggressor . 
  but that was the title in germany and i just wanted to give a translation of it . 
  sorry for german source , but it is an interesting topic nonetheless . 
   the german newspaper `` s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung '' reports exclusive how the eu tries to deal with trump 's suggested 20 % import tax for european products . 
  in discussion are national , multilateral and european measures . 
   * scenario 1 : * european companies can get a 20 % national tax reduction for those products with an us import tax . 
  this way the products will cost the same in the us , but be subsidized by the national governments . 
   * scenario 2 : * calling in the wto about the import tax . 
  unlikely scenario , because this could take years and the results could go either way . 
   * scenario 3 : * an eu import tax for us products . 
  ( provided that all eu partner agree on this as well as the wto greenlights it . ), 
   the article also mentiones that the trump administrations wants to talk with merkel about the german trade surplus . 
  germany blocks such talks , as talks about trade ties are `` an exclusive responsibility of the eu '' . 
  * edit : since the article is in german only and this is right now the only translation of the article , i find it sad to see that this so far down . 
  do most people comment here just because of the headline ? 
  ( which is btw not a really good one , because the eu does n't want a trade war and only prepares for the worst . 
  but it is a translation of the article headline . 
  ) * * edit 2 : seems like my edit rant worked  *, 
  well that 's almost evenly distributed . 
  what can you make of it ? 
  what are the coalition options ? 
  ( excuse my ignorance for your politics , please . ), 
  you make no sense . 
  thanks , mate !, 
   is n't it a degradation for you as a country ? 
  nope . 
  it shows that you can do afterwards lots of stuff to compensate the stuff you missed in school . 
  of course it would be better if he just paid attention the first time ( which is also his stance today ) . 
  he is qualified for the job . 
  he speaks many languages , has experience as a politician and has handled stresful jobs . 
  why should his school education still matter ? 
   people like schulz or kohn-bandit as any kind of authorities ? 
  seriously ? 
  do n't know the last one , but schulz ? 
  yes , of course !, 
  apart from ones political position : merkel und schulz both showed that they can be leaders and political autorities . 
  germany is really lucky in that matter this election . 
   hope modern germans are more resistent to this propaganda level . 
  i do n't think that many read the english ft  anyway , thank you for your long answer . 
  but : i do n't really agree with you that the ft is doing propaganda for the spd / schulz . 
  their readers are probably closer to the cdu than the spd . 
  what about the last two paragraphes ? 
   outside the meeting , there were notes of scepticism . 
  `` martin schulz -- is n't he the one that made sure they did n't investigate [ european commission president jean-claude ] juncker 's tax deals in luxembourg ? '' says lars , a schwerte taxi driver . 
   but inside the hall , there was no room for naysayers . 
  what do you mean by `` beautiful propaganda congratulatory scroll for tovarisch or commerade schulz '' ? 
   but the evidence is inconclusive that is my point as well . 
  i do not trust this `` he told me privately , you have no proof , i have no proof '' source in the first article . 
  the second quote shows his stance towards the matter : never again , never forget . 
  in short : the quote by / u/redditislesuk is most likely best to be ignored . 
  all i could find on a semi-serious looking site ( slogan : `` alternative views , not alternative facts '' ) is this :  [ and fourth , martin schulz , the president of the european parliament , is a close friend of mine . 
  on most issues connected to the israeli-palestinian conflict we disagree . 
  he is closer to the israeli mainstream , and his positions resemble those of labor party chairman isaac herzog . 
  he once told me , during a frank and stern conversation , `` for me , the new germany exists only in order to ensure the existence of the state of israel and the jewish people . '' he 's a brilliant intellectual and a thoughtful politician , and we do n't need to worry -- he wo n't give up his existential friendship so easily . 
  and certainly not because of bennett or his colleague orit strock , the party whip . 
  ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/misc/iphone-article/.premium-1.574332 ) more trustworthy seems the speech he made in front of the israeli parlament as president of the ep :  [ i was born in 1955 . 
  i am a german who did not experience at first hand the atrocities of national socialism , but the crimes committed by the nazis were the reason i became involved in politics and their repercussions have influenced political thinking from the start . 
  i bear the same responsibility as every other german for the mass murder perpetrated in the name of my nation . 
  in the name of my nation , the jewish people were forced to endure suffering for which no reparation can ever be made . 
  i bow down before the memory of all those who were murdered . 
  as a german who holds political office , and international political office at that , i regard it as my first duty to honour the following pledge : never again . 
  never forget . 
  ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/full-text-of-european-parliament-presidents-speech-to-knesset/ ), 
  did n't mean to be . 
  but reading it now , yes you 're right . 
  even with the  but oh well , comment is deleted now anyway . . 
   mr schulz 's messaging was often pure leftwing populism . 
  he lashed out at tax-dodging corporations and fat-cat bosses on million-dollar bonuses . 
  he said he would invest germany 's record budget surplus in education -- in contrast to the finance minister , wolfgang sch\u00e4uble , who wants to use it to pay down debt .
