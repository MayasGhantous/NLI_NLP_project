   but he had harsh words for the populists of the right , saying the afd had brought shame on germany . 
  he also made a passionate defence of the eu , which he said had ensured peace in europe . 
   outside the meeting , there were notes of scepticism . 
  `` martin schulz -- is n't he the one that made sure they did n't investigate [ european commission president jean-claude ] juncker 's tax deals in luxembourg ? '' says lars , a schwerte taxi driver . 
  that is one informed taxi driver . 
  is it true though ? 
  ( humbly asking )  but inside the hall , there was no room for naysayers . 
  of course there was no room for naysayers at this particular event - the other parties had a similar event at the same time . 
  no room for naysayers and more direct insults , as is tradition on this special ash wednesday rallies . 
   at least read the article before upvoting , leftists . 
  you seem a bit passive-aggressive . 
  did you not sleep well ? 
  hope you have a wonderful day , 
  merkel has now been chancellor of germany for 12 years . 
  that pic is supposed to be a mammoth with her face . 
  the word `` mammutti '' is a word play of both the words `` mammut '' , german for mammoth , and `` mutti '' , german for mommy , which is also merkel 's nickname in germany . 
  the guy on the left is left-wing politician martin schulz who runs against merkel in the upcoming election . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
   edit : yes i saw previous years merkel bashing , that 's why i 'm surprised none this year . 
  look @ image 11, 
   and yet the `` carnival floats '' ridiculously try to focus on what does n't concern them while their house burns down :d, 
  the last image is about schulz , who is a left-wing politician . 
  they did plenty of caricatures of muslims too in the last years . 
  in short : they do this every year and make fun of literally everyone . 
  no agenda . 
  when exactly did the us ever conquer land since 1900 ? 
  well it is true , in my / r/eu4 game . 
  sounds like a movie plot, 
  the sad part is that there 's a bit of truth in that statement . . 
  sad to see greece 's minimum wage declining . . also , minimum wage in germany was looong overdue !, 
  happy cake day !, 
  no , he 's not the voice . 
  you can hear his english in this [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzc8tbtidhi ), 
  b\u00f6hmermann ( the german guy who started the collaboration with everysecondcounts ) said yesterday there are more to come and in the making . 
  next week israel ( ! ), 
  is going to release their video !, 
  i posted this in r/worldnews on the same link as well :  the chatham house europe programme , with kantar public , surveyed nationally representative samples of the population aged 18 or over in austria , belgium , france , germany , greece , hungary , italy , poland , spain and the uk . 
  fieldwork was carried out online using quota sampling ( age , gender and region ) between 12 december 2016 and 11 january 2017 . 
  ** the total number of respondents was 10,195 ( c. 1,000 per country ) . ** [ source at bottom of this page . 
  ] ( https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/what-do-europeans-think-about-muslim-immigration ) so we 're probably talking about a huge margin of error here . . 
  why does the subline say  if there would be a referendum in [ country ] about the membership of ** germany ** in the eu , how would they vote ? 
  so it 's the countries opinion on germany ? 
  or is it an error ? 
   it seems / r/europe did not appreciate my silly fellowship of the rings quote . 
  not really a well-known quote . 
  i only recognized it after you mentioned that it was a quote . 
  ouch . 
  yeah , my bad . 
  i totally love the smiling house in the moderator 's background, 
  to clarify : the pic was from a fkk beach ( = nude beach , quite common in east germany during her childhood ) . 
  nothing in an erotic context . 
  but 8,87 is the hourly minimum wage , not per minute , 
  it depends mostly on the time of the post , whether mericans are sleeping or europeans are sleeping . 
  the former are for more right in general than us in europe . 
   i had been going through it a few months back , when i was doing some searches about my grandparents ' birthplaces . 
  how old were your grandparents that you looked at a map from around ~ 200 ad ? 
   if we call ourselves bohemia then everyone in us will think we are gypsies . 
  but then you could sing a rhapsody !, 
  a really excellent book !, 
  i highly recommend it , it shows how we are thinking and what `` mistakes '' we easily make . 
  darren sure seems to like the * other side * ...  . , 
  freedom of expression to be exact ( at least in germany ) , which has its limits . 
   you do n't fine the paper company . 
  i sure would , because it helped you spread it . 
   you fine the person making up the story , not the medium it is shared on . 
  why not both ? 
  yeah , but i 'm willing to give them a chance and wait for the detailed plan early next year . 
   do you think people are too stupid to figure it out themselves ? 
  yes ( unfortunately ) . 
  i 'm not familiar with law either ( i 'm german , but not a lawyer ) . 
  what i stated is their proposed plan right now . 
  they will work it out ( with more details ) in the beginning of 2017 , afterwards it will be discussed in the parliament . 
  right now , without the details , one can not say much about the to be proposed law , but only about the general direction . 
  how about a judge who has to give you a plausible reasoning ? 
  the last instance would be the legal system . 
  the same happens by the way in everyday newspapers . 
  if you write an obvious false article i can apply to the court to take it down or to have them publish a counter statement . 
  because the idea was proposed by merkel herself and she can only tackle on problem at a time ? 
  the idea came from an initative from both coalition parties . 
  merkel probably has heard about it on the way , but was not directly involved and even if , she can easily focus on several things simultaneously , as can everyone else . 
  i think it would be - generally speaking !, 
  - a good idea to stop obviously false news to be spread around via facebook . 
  it all depends on the execution of the law . 
  state sponsored media can also be good ( like it is in germany ) or really bad ( like some propaganda press in idk . . north korea ) . 
  how i read your post :  i 'm dumb . 
  seriosly , it 's a plan proposed by the spd and cdu . 
  not a law , just a plan at the moment . 
  it 's probably going to be changed a bit , then discussed in the parlament , then voted for or not , then maybe taken to court and then maybe applied or not . 
  long way to go nontheless . 
  not sure why you think germany or facebook is `` left-wing '' , but whatever . 
   but do you have any special german law in mind ? 
  apparently , they try to see facebook not as a news aggregation site but like a news publisher . 
  the latter has a liability for its content . 
  e.g. , if a german newspaper publishes something completely false , i can call the court to order them to take it down , or have them publish a counter statement by me etc. 
  the copyright was only in the hands of the state of bavaria and they refused to print a single edition . 
  copyright protection is not in place anymore for hitler ( expires 70 years after the death ) and therefore anyone can now print it . 
  holocaust denial was banned for obvious reasons after ww2 and has n't been revoked since then ( and why should anyone bother ? 
  for that you would also need a connection between all surveillance cameras in germany controlled by a state department , which would be some 1984 kind of control shit . 
  yes , they wanted a light-hearted movie reminding people of their childhood after the war 's turning point . 
  one of the few ( or the only one ? ),
