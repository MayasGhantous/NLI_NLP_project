  happens with national politicians too though . 
  not that it is n't disgusting ... 
  allies seems far-fetched . 
   it is a zero-sum game . 
  a zero-sum game does n't mean compromise is impossible , or even a bad thing . 
  i 'd say ukraine situation is a prisoner 's dilemma , with escalation being the `` defect '' option . 
  even if it 's not , it might still be worthwhile to compromise in one theatre so that cooperation in other , non zero-sum games becomes feasible . 
   anyone who bemoans saudi arabia , china et cetera for human rights abuses , lack of civil liberties , transparency , and democracy should do the same for russia . 
  that 's true but it cuts both ways . 
  some us ( and eu ) allies that we have now have bad human rights records . 
  so anyone who says friendly relations with russia are impossible because of russia 's domestic policies should also campaign to drop those as allies . 
  then there 's the messy middle ground . 
  well we could go ahead and give all eu powers to the eu parliament . 
  everybody gets to vote for those . 
  get rid of the council and the commission . 
  then each countries ' politicians would only have a say over the countries they were elected in , and politicians elected by everyone in the eu together would have a say over everyone . 
  it 's more that every party looks at issues that are neglected , or if none do then someone founds a new party . 
  and if they find an issue that they can be about without contradicting the ones they already have , they pick it up . 
  it 's like the afd in germany started as an eurosceptic party since there were n't any , and then as under merkel the cdu had dropped the anti-immigration issue since that interfered with holding on to the political centre , the afd picked that up too . 
  then the anti-immigration people squeezed out the eurosceptics , and now it 's mostly anti-immigration . 
  it 's true that there 's also the tribal factor - if the people you hang out with a lot have some opinions that are important to them , you might start having those too . 
  at the least you 'll be seeing things from their viewpoint more , get told stories about why they believe the things they do ... 
  in a two-party system you can only have two sets of issues . 
  so you mash them together , in ways that sometimes make sense , sometimes not so much . 
  multi-party systems are a bit more flexible , but a hundred single-issue parties would n't be very practical , so there are limits . 
  `` moderating some of the excesses of capitalism '' is what trump is running on , too , though . 
  that and the standard right wing program ( plus isolationism instead of the regular bipartisan interventionism , i guess ) . 
  that bit is somewhat disingenuous though . 
  despite what many right-wing people like to claim , only a few whackos call * all * trump supporters racist . 
  even clinton with her `` basket of deplorables '' comment only claimed * half * were one or more of racist , homephobe , sexist , and whatever else she had in her basket . 
  ( and right in the next sentence she said that they 'd have to engage with his other supporters , because they were n't - but of course that part did n't fit in the soundbite and made poor clickbait ) so of course they ca n't be dismissed as racist , but then nobody ( ok , * almost * nobody ) was doing that . 
  trump * himself * got called a racist , but that 's fair enough i think . 
  and sure , `` the racists are voting for trump '' but that 's not the same as `` trump voters are racist '' . 
  people seem to hear the latter a lot when the former is said . 
  for the main batch of emails i would n't dispute that , but the weiner batch ... they could have kept it quiet while investigating , and if it turned out to be necessary , impeach her after the election . 
  there was n't a really good solution , but `` aha !, 
  ... wait , nevermind '' in the last days of the election is a bit iffy . 
  i do n't buy that it lost her the election all by itself - it may well have made the difference , but so did her basket of deplorables gaffe - but having the security services decide an election should be political nightmare juice . 
  there 's not one single factor that lost her the election . 
  or rather there are dozens , some bigger , some smaller . 
  just picking a different vp might have done the trick , for example . 
  they did decide to hit deutsche bank with a massive fine . 
  conspiracy theory going with that is a ) make a show of being tough on banks b ) they 'd given trump a big loan c ) ( okay , this one 's my idea ) `` keep your filthy hands off google 's money , europe ! '', 
  we are in a deflation though , varoufakis is definitely right about that . 
  we have negative interest rates and still no one invests in anything . 
  if you got rid of fptp , you could have a christian party , a neocon party , an lgbt party , a green party ... 
  which is mostly because those jobs are now done by chinese . 
  or robots in china . 
  it 's the [ elephant curve of globalization  ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-27/get-ready-to-see-this-globalization-elephant-chart-over-and-over-again )  the biggest losers ( other than the very poorest 5 percent ) , or at least the ` non-winners , ' of globalization were those between the 75th and 90th percentiles of the global income distribution whose real income gains were essentially nil , '' according to milanovic . 
  `` these people , who may be called a global upper-middle class , include many from former communist countries and latin america , as well as those citizens of rich countries whose incomes stagnated . 
  1988-2008 the european and us lower-middle class stagnated , rich got richer . 
  it 's hardly a landslide though . 
  and going by internet comments , a lot of people only voted for trump because they hated clinton so much , or at least abstained . 
  you 're right that she had most of the media with her , but not fox and everything rightward , and the mainstream media are rapidly loosing importance - actually , that may be the thing that sets this election apart , its kennedy-nixon debate moment . 
  that and the pollster failure . 
  not necessarily ; there 's three ways out of this . 
  1 . economic growth : make or do more stuff - needs a bit of inflation and lots of capital , this is the way the west has chosen - problems : chinese have most of the growth , the environment has limits , capitalism means boom and bust cycles 2 . make-work for everybody : the communist way - problems : see soviet union , the fall of the - but not only them , see [ bullshit jobs ] ( http://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/ ) 3 . everybody works less : we do some of that in europe - problems : not really sure , bad for anything that needs to be coordinated i guess , [ also more graeber on this ] ( https://www.salon.com/2014/06/01/help_us_thomas_piketty_the_1s_sick_and_twisted_new_scheme/ ), 
  was n't meant to be a description of how things are , but a scenario of how things could go in the mid-term . 
  and yeah , if i had to pick one of the three , it 'd definitely be america , but even better would be not having to pick at all . 
  also , depending on how things develop further , in a couple of decades the choice might not be so clear any more . 
  most other definitions i saw were even more clear on nationalism being distinct , merriam-webster was at the top on the list , plus as far as i know it 's considered pretty authoritative . 
  i did n't say there was anything wrong with it , i just thought he was using the word nationalism to describe patriotism . 
  i do think there might be something wrong with that , in that once you have people comfortable with the harmless `` patriotism '' definition , you can then whip out a dictionary and push the harder one . 
  sort of like `` feminism is wanting to men and women to have equal rights . 
  as a feminist , how ca n't you support safe spaces ? '', 
  not that i think he was doing that , but if it seems far fetched to you , on [ urbandictionary ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nationalism ) someone snuck in this definition :  nationalism is the belief that your country has the right to exist on its own . 
  not to be confused with patriotism . 
  that 's not nationalism , that 's just ... mainstream politics . 
  now imagine someone who has this definition in his head hear someone else complain about nationalist politics ( in the merriam-webster definition ) . 
  he 'll thing that other guy is crazy , or a `` globalist establishment cuck . '', 
  it 's the electoral college , both parties are playing a game of risk . 
  and have to , in order to avoid what happened to clinton : win the popular vote but lose the election . 
  in the us ? 
  you definitely do not want to talk about class explicitly , . 
  people will call you a communist ( although maybe that has changed a bit , with the cold war longer gone ) . 
  i sometimes think half the reason why identity politics got so big is because that way the left did n't have to . 
  clinton definitely had a believability problem after saying that you needed `` a public and a private position '' at that private banker speech . 
  i do think that probably the biggest misstep the dems made was that they lost the white rustbelt because clinton did n't sell the economic message . 
  she adopted a few of sanders ' positions after he did so well , but could n't do it believably . 
  and on the other hand , women 's rights and ant-racism did n't do well enough to make up for that . 
  if you look at exit polls , trump did amazingly well with woman and latinos ( 30 % ! ), 
  considering he is ... well , trump . 
  have n't seen any statistics on how he did with lgbt , but my guess would be he did pretty well there too . 
  again , considering . 
  i do n't think you can reduce trumps victory to any one factor . 
  clinton being personally unpopular , sexism , racism , frustration at the political system , anti-globalism , isolationism , latinos being concentrated in blue states and yes , the culture wars all played a part and any one or two of those factors different , that might have been enough for a narrow win for her . 
  there were plenty of inter-christian conflicts before that . 
  constantine had to settle a huge dispute practically immediately after he adopted it for the roman empire , in 300 something ad . 
  hey , before that the christians were the persecuted ones ; identity politics with live animals . 
  but where the ethnic identities do n't match the nationality , it 's not necessarily a left/right issue , is it ? 
  the national government want to downplay the ethnic identity , separatist movements want to play it up . 
  they can do the latter with left-wing politics like the snp in scotland or with right-wing politics like the lega nord in italy .

  wait can you remove your head of government by popular vote in your country ? 
  because that would be really uncommon . 
  unless you mean regular election , which we had , in which juncker got elected and schulz ( and also a bunch of also-rans ) did n't .
