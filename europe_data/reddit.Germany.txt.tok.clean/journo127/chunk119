  why the world 's biggest trade liberalizing agreement is good for the world 's biggest net exporter , whose 50 % of jobs depend on exports ? 
  yeah , i wonder . 
  merkel will go home if she loses, 
  only about the top 1 % . 
  my comment provides info about other categories too . 
  thats what i did ? 
  those countries have lower taxes , 
  netherlands , austria , switzerland , scandinavia , canada , uk or the us are `` developing world '' now ? 
  we have super duper high tax rates . 
  income taxes ( including social contributions ) for the middle class are * the * highest in the world . 
  for low incomes , some of the highest in the world . 
  for the richest , still one of the highest , albeit definitely behind several scandinavian countries or even netherlands . 
  our corporate tax rate is high and allows for less reductions than in other countries ( say , us ) . 
  high vat . 
  high property taxes . 
  the only thing we score `` well '' on are inheritance taxes , and i do n't think low inheritance taxes are a good thing overall . 
  for everyone , 
  just did, 
  angela merkel 's visit to washington next week will be among the most important -- and most awkward -- of her career . 
  the german chancellor must attempt to strike up a decent relationship with donald trump , despite the scorn he has poured on her policies . 
  ms merkel did not seek this challenge . 
  nonetheless , it could be useful if it prompts an overdue rethink of germany 's place in the world . 
  since the second world war german leaders have , understandably , shrunk from the idea that their country can exercise leadership on the global stage . 
  the view in bonn and then berlin was that german power should be exercised through `` europe '' . 
  but the eu is no longer enough . 
  foreign policy challenges are crowding in : a us president who questions the nato alliance , war in ukraine , refugees from a collapsing middle east , brexit , and turkey 's nationalist turn . 
  the eu is too weak and germany is too large for `` europe '' to be a complete response to all these challenges . 
  at the same time , talk of germany emerging as the moral leader of the west is wildly overblown . 
  the truth lies somewhere in between . 
  germany needs a more imaginative and assertive approach to the world , alongside an appreciation of the limits of what it can do alone . 
  start with military spending . 
  in the age of mr trump and russia 's vladimir putin , the issue can no longer be avoided . 
  germany spends less than 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence , compared with a nato target of 2 per cent . 
  this has to change , and germany has pledged to meet the nato target by the mid-2020s . 
  but , with the agreement of its allies , it would make sense to spend some of the additional money on broader security issues rather than pouring it all into rearmament . 
  german largesse could go into the funding of proper border police for the eu and refugee processing centres and stabilisation funds for north african countries such as libya . 
  the idea of a `` european army '' remains popular in germany . 
  but deep military integration is unrealistic when eu countries are divided on fundamental foreign policy issues . 
  for the moment , it would be better to push harder on a practical matters such as common eu procurement policies on weaponry , which would make it much easier for eu armies to work together . 
  germany needs a more imaginative and assertive approach to the world , alongside an appreciation of the limits of what it can do alone germany also faces crucial diplomatic challenges . 
  on brexit , the merkel government ( or its successor ) has to balance maintaining eu unity with the broader interest in a solid economic and strategic relationship with britain . 
  there is a danger that the current mantra of `` no cherry-picking '' ( that is , no special deals for britain ) will lead to a needlessly confrontational brexit that leaves germany poorer and less safe . 
  when it comes to russia , germany has done a courageous job of leading the eu sanctions effort over ukraine . 
  the danger now is that a us policy shift will cut the ground from underneath ms merkel . 
  the chancellor should use her washington visit to make the case for holding the line on sanctions until russia stops meddling in ukraine . 
  with the us posture towards russia in chaos , her voice could count for a lot . 
  more broadly , germany can make the case for the rules-based international system , in washington and elsewhere . 
  as the trump administration weighs the temptations of ignoring the world trade organization and bypassing the un , ms merkel can and should emerge as a champion of the global trading system and international law . 
  the challenges ms merkel faces -- from moscow to the middle east and from washington to london -- are daunting . 
  but germany has two big things going for it : a strong economy and international respect -- global opinion polls regularly show that modern germany is one of the most popular countries in the world . 
  germany can retain the respect of international opinion , even as it takes a more energetic leadership role , by sticking to ms merkel 's values-based approach to foreign policy . 
  she emphasised shared western values in her initial , appropriately cautious , response to mr trump 's victory . 
  despite depending upon the co-operation of president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey over refugees , ms merkel has spoken out on behalf of press freedom in his country . 
  the badly needed transition to a vigorous and creative german foreign policy will be politically difficult , both at home and abroad . 
  standing up for liberal values around the world will open the way . 
  each of the three german carmakers sells , on its own , millions of cars more than tesla .

  you ca n't get drunk with beers unless you drink an infinite amount, 
  wealth inequality is not income inequality two words : house ownership . 
  yay , the good donald won this time . 
  merkel looked ok in the last 2-3 campaign speeches . 
  schulz is doing his stuff as usual . 
  afd might get single digits ( will probably , in my opinion ) .
