  and i am telling you it 's entirely possible to issue a short term visa for only one country, 
  and for checking out the apartment 's neighborhood you 'll stay in if you 're renting it for a short term and have to book it through the internet, 
  lol that 's stupid why would russia do that ? 
  merkel is their best bet , hell , anyone 's best bet if they want an working relationship , and putin definitely wants that, 
  really ? 
  can not talk about that , i do n't know anyone who works with bulgarians in a highly skilled profession . 
  would n't be surprised though - that region has good education . 
   both parties have to voluntarily agree for the dispute to be mediated by the sharia organization yes , i am sure the pakistani community will be very happy when a girl from their families will ignore a decision by a sharia court . 
  it 's even stupid as some eastern european countries have great school systems and prepare excellent students . 
  they may have mickey mouse degrees and stuff , but for example polish doctors who graduated in warsaw are in great demand here . 
  czech engineering schools are very good too . 
   i do n't think it is reasonable to expect the germans , especially the coming generation , not to react violently to their country , families and institutions being bled out by the eu ** because half of the eu can not take care of themselves and need a nanny ** here we go then , if you were looking for controversial statements :'), 
  she 's amazing at taking care of things - when things are going well . 
  she 's the single most amazing politician on earth when it comes to that . 
  when it comes to doing unpopular things and taking a late-minute decision - ah , then she sleeps . 
  swiss italians are more german than those in italy , swiss frenchies are more german than those in france and swiss germans are more german than germans . 
  no idea , i heard about some global youth event that will take part in march in warsaw in the news and they said that 's the reason they 're checking people . 
  now can anyone informed warsawer illuminate us please ? 
  kosovo , but i know it was the same case with a couple of serbians my dad worked with ( prior to their visa liberalization , so a decade ago ) . 
  they had to take a plane to germany because taking a visa for austria too would take more time and money . 
  i do n't know about americans in particular , but it 's entirely possible to be a non-schengen citizen and get visa only for one specific country . 
  friend of a friend wanted to go to austria by car and could n't do so , because he would have to go through hungary and did n't have a visa for that . 
  he had to take a plane directly to vienna . 
  going from milano to istanbul would be cycling through * several * borders : slovenia - croatia , then croatia - serbia , then serbia - romania , then romania - bulgaria , then bulgaria - turkey . 
  that 's 5 borders to be checked on -- before the refugee crisis started . 
  at one point , a few decades ago , they also decided to throw protesters in the river . 
  * in paris * . 
  they do n't bring order , they bring freedoooom, 
  you 've obviously never visited switzerland, 
   this would mean we could still benefit from the talent pool of northern and western europe without having wages driven down by eastern europeans and without having roma beggars everywhere , which are the two main criticisms of our current arrangement . 
  because a good portion of turks do n't give a flying fuck . 
  the ones that do pray five teams per day , and then you see them buying beers at the local supermarket . 
  turks , bosnians , albanians , etc are not the `` problematic '' muslims , and we got plenty of them . 
  china is now an eu member ? 
  you did an amazing job to guard your border with ukraine in the last years, 
  albania , if i had to guess . 
  italy . 
  spain for the na . 
   i still remember our german finance minister getting shunned ** by his boss and the americans **, 
  last time they voted for tsipras . 
  because bitching about italy does n't win you political points, 
  dunno about idomeni , but since december we 're getting more families here instead of young men ( compared to sep/oct/previously ) . 
  source : friend works with them . 
  again : in each point of history , from 1990-sth to summer 2015 , every person travelling from greece to germany through the `` western route '' had to cross 4 borders . 
  greece-macedonia , then macedonia-serbia , then serbia - croatia , then croatia - slovenia . 
  what does merkel have to do with these four borders ? 
  poland does n't have space ? 
  they get permanent residence in germany faster than they would if they were here as legal economic immigrants . 
  yes , of course , keep dreaming . 
  then they will make a documentary about poor little ahmed who started going to school in frankfurt and has made new friends in his school and deserves to stay in frankfurt, 
  my brother has to travel through austria to get to his job in another city ( southern germany ) . 
  there are * millions * like him . 
  if they start checking people in that part of the road , he simply has to switch to second-hand , badly-maintained shitty roads . 
  why would n't criminals do the same thing ? 
   an illegal immigrant would have to cross 6 borders before getting into germany . 
  without them , they just have to cross one single huge huge huge border and they 're home free . 
  immigrant is in greece . 
  in 2014 , they had to cross 4 borders . 
  now they have to cross 6 . 
  big difference ? 
  uhm , would n't you pass through like a billion borders in the balkans anyway ? 
  with or without the refugee crisis ? 
  they are checking people now that there is some event to be organized in warsaw, 
  the weirdest airport i 've ever used was k\u00f6ln . 
  i would n't be surprised if one day they stopped checking tickets, 
  they are still in a national emergency situation where half of the constitution does n't apply , because * logic *, 
  they look like a fat cake, 
  they do n't look like that in munich - not at all . 
  they look cool and are a different style . 
  whose idea was to have these , uhm , stairs-ish buildings ? 
  that 's cool though . 
  ugly , sure , but it does have a `` cool '' feeling . 
  it 's definitely not drab and boring, 
  that 's huge . 
  any idea how many apartments are in that building ? 
   a lot of the commie building suffer from neglect and depressing colours . 
  putting a fresh coat of paint would do a lot for them . 
  worked for tirana , the city looked fun with all the flowery buildings and stars and stuff, 
  lol they 're not even informing the people passing that they have the right to apply in austria . 
  just `` pass , pass , have your ticket , have a nice trip '', 
  even without the migrant crisis , i think merkel will be remember at least here simply because of how long she 's been in office . 
  i have not known another cdu leader . 
  i could n't even vote for her the first time , but my brother voted three times for csu ( = merkel for chancellor ) and could n't even vote in 2002 . 
  so now he 's 30 and will become a father soon - his baby will be born under a merkel government . 
  aaaand then the global financial crisis , eu-skepticism , the greek debt problems , crimea , etc. 
  putin too - he defines 21th century russia . 
  erdogan too maybe . 
  obama ... dunno . 
  neither hollande nor sarkozy would get there , i can not link anything significant with them . 
  berlusconi was a clown , renzi is a baby and rajoy is too boring to care about . 
  cameron might be known like the pm during brexit , but more for boring us all to no end for that stupid & insignificant eu deal . 
  polish or dutch politicians , none are too interesting . 
  guys , i think we found the solution for the migrants crisis . 
  you can take her . 
  no need to pay and she has to be back in 12 months , bye . 
  her approval rating plummeted by 20 percentage points . 
  if i was her , i would be worried . 
  it was the greek government that fucked its country for decades . 
  do n't blame it on merkel . 
  oh , and i am pretty sure that while she did n't command it , she definitely pushed your taxi driver into this new policy,
