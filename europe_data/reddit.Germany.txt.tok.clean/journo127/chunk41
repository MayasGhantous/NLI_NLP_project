  normally i am strongly against any foreign politician talking about domestic issues and i absolutely despise certain actions of your current government , but this ( and what the dutch pm said ) is a slap i honestly welcome, 
  group of men , with a total number around 50-60 , circling women and molesting them in a public transport station , on nye ? 
  the last time that happened in germany was in 1945, 
  which makes me understand why the dutch in this post are against this re-scheduling ... 
  what i say in another comment , is that muslim nations , including turkey , schedule national exams during ramadan, 
  why on hell ramadan does n't overlap with the euros this year not that the kids in the uk would have too many matches to watch but seriously, 
  losing weeks that could be used for revision does n't impact performance ? 
  okay, 
  i 've had muslim friends who were fastening during exams and came out in the top 10 % of our school, 
  yes wan na talk shit about jesus ? 
  go ahead mention may 19th 2012 and i ** will ** kick your butt, 
  exams should not be on christmas or on eid ( their holiday ) . 
  ramadan is not a happy day once a year , it 's one month have you ever had an exam on sunday ? 
  sorry but is n't that a state religion in the uk , while islam is n't ? 
  and we 're not talking about eid . 
  yes , i have no problems with no exams on eid , but ramadan is one month . 
  it 's worse than no exams on sundays . 
  i 've had exams on sunday , and i live in a catholic city , maybe the most religious in the whole country, 
  from the big 3 , france is the only one actually tryng to keep their country secular . 
  their efforts are failing , but at least they do n't get nationwide halal food in prisons , change exam dates or whatever, 
  for both you and / u/falconberger : say your daughter ( turkish ) studies in prague . 
  probably she would get glared at in some places when they heard hear speak turkish or simply for being dark . 
  once she attended a football match , and one of those `` fans '' spat on her ( again , heard her speaking turkish ) . 
  that would be rare in germany , would n't it ? 
  this incident is n't worse that getting sexually molested in a public place by people your own government decided to invite , * because of it 's anti-xenophobia and an obsession to appear xenophobic * . 
  so ... yeah , 
  in a nation of 80 million people where almost all will be drunk of nye , some women will be groped . 
  terrific but true . 
  what we are saying is not that . 
  i was in prague a few years ago for nye , a couple of american students , drunk to the point of `` they-could-kill-each-other '' started harrassing touching a girl , a couple of men intervened , everything went on peacefully . 
  that does n't mean americans are all perverts who deserve to die . 
  we know that the police can not guarantee the personal safety of every single woman on this night . 
  we are not asking for that . 
  what we saw on nye in k\u00f6ln is masses of men , who pre-planned this thing , picked a place , formed groups of tens , encircled women and started assaulting them . 
  it was an occasion of lawlessness . 
  yes , european men grope too , big news . 
  but i ca n't remember another occasion where tens of men were organized to do this in a public place , while around 1000 other men blocked passages and made sure the police could n't help . 
  simple as that . 
   priorities, 
  so again , why do you think 1.7 million are in three countries and like 17 in france or netherlands or whatever ? 
  did they use google and found out about potatoes and were intrigued so decided to come ? 
  do n't you think there might be a small , soft pull factor that makes these men choose germany or sweden ? 
  yes , you can mention bvg a billion times , feel free to do so . 
  but you wo n't be able to convince me that bvb is the reason why germany has taken ** only in 2015 ** 1.1 million asylum seekers , sweden 280.000 and the rest of europe , uhm . . five ? 
  so we should stop using public transport ? 
  it 's not like those women went to a mosque and started stripping , they were using public transport, 
  secure our borders ? 
  stop giving shelter and benefits and enough money to buy booze & fireworks to those who come here from hundreds of km away and arrest anyone who wanders around , because for all i know , turkey , greece , macedonia , hungary and austria are n't war-torn countries . 
  then of course , help with camps in turkey and elsewhere . 
  but our government 's social benefits are not sth we have to talk with eu for . 
  amazing . 
  a nation of 70 million muslims whose government is going full-islamist mode is fine with exams during ramadan . 
  but uk , where some kids will fasten ( when they are actually not supposed to fasten ) decides to change exam dates am-fucking-azing, 
  no , they do n't , i say this because i was specifically told by a friend that her exam was while she was fastening and she blacked out, 
  locals of second generation ? 
  what ? 
  they moved from the countryside to helsinki ? 
  he was talking about the situation in general, 
  if you arrest everyone who throws fireworks at people in every central european city , soon we 'll have to invade siberia to find space for all of them lifting women 's skirt , of course . 
  but the ugliest things happened inside the station , and the chance of someone hanging around , taking out his iphone and taking a video of 5 men groping a woman a meter in front of him is low, 
  kosovo and bosnia , among the lowest crime rates in europe, 
  yes , and a month ago there were huge escalations between fans in frankfurt . 
  guess what , not a single woman reported a sexual assault . 
  it is not the same, 
  around 4000 , yes, 
  riots , not sexual assaults . 
  i can film someone if they 're breaking into a shop . 
  i wo n't film someone groping my girlfriend, 
  they do n't cover the whole stations actually, 
  bcz whoever was on his own would either be attacked or run away as soon as he can , instead of taking selfies, 
  handcuffing them is still better than leaving them free to roam . 
  handcuff some dozens if there are no places to be put would be a small , but not insignificant action that buys you time for reinforcements, 
  i have been arrested like that six years ago and spent one night in jail - t 's not good , but i understand it . 
  my night in jail and the five-minute very respectful questioning by the police is not worse than having hundreds of rapists around in a chaos night . 
  how in hell ... 
  her on an american website ? 
  never, 
  i am not so sure , no `` backlash '' yet , only on twitter : /, 
  then maybe do sth instead of focusing on hate speech stuff, 
  wonder whether the message the got is `` the state is powerless '' ? 
  how much is her approval rate in germany for her leading eu role ? 
  how many are fine with hundreds of men assaulting men ? 
  not 90 % . 
  domestic support for every foreign crisis she got involved in was over the moon, 
  then take a million japanese , spaniards , ukrainians . 
  why people from the single most backwards region in the planet ? 
  i am not a journalist , my username is a long story, 
  my boss allowing us to watch news during work is big news my boss telling us to watch news is like a man landing on moon : a historic moment she was distraught as for merkel - let 's see, 
  we 've all went to `` sleep overs '' when 15 , both on a sexual and non-sexual occasions, 
  that 's dating rape related . 
  horrible , but one of those horrible things that happen either way + the police can not do much about it . 
  but what has happened in public places is downright terror . 
  first time in my three years here that my boss specifically said we can take our time to check news and postponed a deadline from tonight to tomorrow because she `` understands how distraught one can be '', 
  wait , what ???? 
  they do n't know it because the last time these kind of stuff happened was when soviets were in berlin, 
  berlin i think, 
  on the other hand , it 's weird that their german is that good , 
  can confirm , had girls over in high school when parents were away . 
  are there seriously people who think we are overreacting ? 
  hun , we can barely keep ourselves in the eu :(,
