  germany , the most important country in europe , trades so much with britain that it would suffer from a messy divorce between britain and the european union . 
  so even if countries such as france want to teach britain a lesson , the theory goes , germany 's carmakers will use their vast influence to sway angela merkel , the german chancellor , to go easy on britain in its coming negotiations with the eu . 
  the first part of this thesis is true . 
  britain is germany 's fifth-largest trading partner and its third-largest export market ( after america and france ) . 
  some 750,000 german jobs depend on those exports , and germany 's trade surplus with britain is second only to the one it runs with america . 
  every fifth car made in germany is sold in britain , as are many german chemicals , machines and electronics . 
  britain is the biggest foreign investor in germany , and some 2,500 german firms have subsidiaries in britain , employing about 400,000 people there . 
  but the rest of the theory gets progressively weaker . 
  start with the notion that industrialists call the shots in germany . 
  they were certainly influential between 1998 and 2005 , when the chancellor was gerhard schr\u00f6der , nicknamed genosse der bosse ( `` fat cats ' comrade '' ) . 
  his signature economic reform , a labour-market liberalisation called `` agenda 2010 '' , was conceived in co-operation with businesses . 
  under mrs merkel , however , `` our influence has been shrinking , '' says lutz goebel , president of the lobby representing the family-owned firms which many people think are the backbone of germany 's economy . 
  business lobbies have lost many skirmishes in recent years . 
  to their horror , the government has enacted a minimum wage , early retirement at 63 for certain workers , quotas for women on corporate boards and more . 
  business folk did win exemptions for about 2,000 energy-intensive manufacturers from paying the big surcharges that fund germany 's subsidies for renewable energy . 
  but it could not prevent the country 's reckless decision in 2011 to end the use of nuclear power . 
  moreover , german business associations accept what they call `` the primacy of politics '' : that national priorities set by government can trump their own . 
  a recent example was mrs merkel 's drive to convince the eu to impose sanctions on russia after its invasion of ukraine . 
  a pro-russian lobby called the ost-ausschuss ( committee on eastern europe ) opposed the sanctions . 
  but the federation of german industry , an affiliated but much larger lobby , declared that it accepted them as necessary in the long-term interest of maintaining the international order . 
  that ended the controversy . 
  brexit raises similar questions of principle , notes volker treier , the head of foreign trade for the association of german chambers of commerce and industry , of which almost all german firms are members . 
  `` two hearts are beating in our breast , '' he says . 
  one worries about the economic consequences of britain leaving the single market . 
  the other worries about the integrity of that single market , should britain or any other state cherry-pick conditions for membership . 
  that emphasis on principle extends even to the carmakers . 
  `` yes , we certainly have influence , '' says matthias wissmann , president of the german association of the automotive industry . 
  `` but we are at least as interested in keeping the european union together -- in fact , that is our priority . '' britons are deluded , he adds , if they think german carmakers care only `` about selling five more cars '' rather than taking a long-term view . 
  contrary to the illusions of some in britain , mrs merkel thus has her own business lobbies firmly behind her . 
  `` we have to present our interests coherently , '' she told a conference of the federation of german industry this month . 
  lobbies , she added , should avoid putting pressure on the negotiators for `` comfortable '' deals that jeopardise the single market 's four freedoms -- of moving goods , services , capital and people . 
  asked whether he agreed with mrs merkel , ulrich grillo , the federation 's boss , had a simple answer : `` yes . '', 
   pc policies merkel ? 
  ** lol **, 
  she 'll win , but you guys are better off with a red-red-green, 
  why pick up `` stupid fights '' ? 
  economic consequences, 
  and her little house in the forest looks very cute from pictures . 
  she can stay there , read books , grow carrots and potatoes and have wild sex with her husband everyday . 
  the perfect retirement plan . 
  that really does n't say much . 
  sanctioning russia means a drop in popularity mate , 
  no there is not , we do n't do death penalty down here, 
  all the five of them . 
  technically he did not : he threatened the guys who turned on his brother . 
  even if he did threaten a terror attack , there 's no justification whatsoever for the military to kill him . 
  got it ? 
  because with all due respect , it 's impossible to find a common solution with toddlers . 
  the first article of the gg ca n't , ** and thank god for that **, 
  extrajuridical killings , yayy . 
  why are they giving this guy public access again ? 
  and was n't it the same guy who said his brother was just a religious sweetheart , not a terrorist ? 
  like ... make up your mind . 
  edit : oh , he means he 'll take revenge on the guys who turned him in . 
  it would be worse to leave the country government-less . 
  10 racist murders , 4 racist bombings , some bank robberies . . you know , the usual things teens do when their hormones got up . 
  someone was covering their ass , end of the story . 
  this story was already disgusting enough with how apparent it is that they were directly helped by certain officials in that fucked-up , incompetent state , and now we see how their `` understanding '' of the group ended up costing the life of a small , beautiful girl in addition to the ten other people we already knew about . 
  i ca n't even bring myself to think about the horror she went through with those monsters , and she would probably now be a young girl with a happy life if it was n't for the implicit support of circles in the police & intel services . 
  it makes my blood boil . 
  idc if their boss is close to afd , there 's nothing suggesting the polls reflect that . 
  however , cdu being below 30 % with online polling is not a surprise because a certain portion of their voters have probably never used a computer in their lives . 
  not in germany honey , not in germany . 
  keep that shit elsewhere . 
  the members were born in jena , but i think we can confidently say that the group had at least the `` understanding '' of at least certain members in the state police of saxony . 
  if we could get info out of him that would help us arrest accomplices , i 'd have no issue with my taxes going for his attorney fees . 
  i agree . . does n't mean that you 'd get the authorization . 
  thing is , good luck getting a permit for surveillance for hartz iv abusers . 
  ofc not , but you need cooperation to actually sentence them . 
  as in , people testifying against them un court . 
  as in , cooperation . 
  the immigrants do n't cooperate ? 
  unemployment insurance should n't be covered by this law , that would be stupid as hell . 
  it 's about hartz iv, 
  the birthrate accounts for the age difference ; however , the birthrate is tied to the woman . 
  since for all countries bar spain and some other tiny country we have significantly more male immigrants than females , it has a lower effect . 
  and the birthrate of immigrants in germany is 1,8 . 
  cool , they can give that money to nhs !, 
  the growth in 2015 is almost exclusively for low-income due to the minimum wage introduction , but good luck convincing people of that . 
  it 's good . 
  i used to stay around with cousins as a teen , and now have to go very often for work . 
  it 's a genuinely nice city , it 's well-governed , and it gets bashed far more than it should . 
  so ... think about it . 
  lol nope . 
  that area is cleaner than it 's been in three decades ( the junkies moved some 2-3 streets to the west , i am referring to the whole area by this comment ) . 
  it used to be a fucking warzone when i was a teen and spent some time around it , now it 's safe enough for a woman to move on her own ( well , i would n't recommend it to anyone because of the sheer numbers of horrific things you 'll see , but if you have to walk through those roads , you can do so without fear ) . 
  if anything , some parts around offenbach or h\u00f6chst have gotten worse , and for god 's sake watch your bag around hauptwache or you 're statistically guaranteed to `` lose '' your wallet . 
  except , when i was there last month , it had turned the whole zone into a mess to cross as a pedestrian . 
  :( but yeah , the city looks nicer than in my teen years . 
  much safer , more green places , more cafes and decent clubs , and probably the most varied cuisine of the country . 
  yes , i saw that . 
  any idea what was going on around eschenheimer tor ? 
  i never thought frankfurt is beautiful , but i 'd love to live there . 
  you get the metropolitan feeling in a tiny city , and nightlife is good . 
  ... it 's not ? 
  yes , law enforcement is a state responsibility , the federal police has limited competencies , that include trains ( because imagine you hunting a criminal & then he crosses into bw & you like `` shit , gon na go back to bayern '' ), 
  statistically speaking , antifa & co attack the police significantly more often than these rw cunts . 
  it 's for crimes like murder where neo-nazis are ahead of everyone else . 
  hopefully , 
  cdu + die gr\u00fcne atm would end up with the sane amount of votes as red-red-green , but they can also get fdp on track .
