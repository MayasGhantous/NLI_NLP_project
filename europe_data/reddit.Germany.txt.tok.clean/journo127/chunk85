  i do n't go around calling for the bundeswehr to use tanks against pegida . 
  but if you stop immigration , you do n't get new potential terrorists . 
  you 're publicly calling for your own countrymen to be killed by your own army because you do n't like their stances on religion . 
  hitler is the monster who started the worst war in the history of civilization and directly orchestrated the industrial killing of millions and millions and millions of people whom he considered `` subhumans '' , not to mention tens of millions of deaths related to the war . 
  he also wanted to starve 30 million slavs to death and raze the entire poland to the ground . 
  his rhetoric on racial purity , the aryan master race & skull size determining life 's value etc. 
  has hurt our continent considerably and we 're still feeling its consequences . 
  erdogan hates the media , wants more power for himself and fucks goats . 
  except when they do and you ignore them, 
  erdogan also governed through the best economic period in turkey ( although now it 's gone to shit , but people still have jobs & poverty is down ) . 
  infrastructure developed tremendously . 
  safety actually increased under his rule . 
  he built a constructive relationship with the kurds ( again , that just went to shit too ) . 
  and also , he `` pandered '' to country 's religious conservatives . 
  it may sound weird to you , but if i was a religious covered muslim girl , i would n't be happy if my country ( 95 % muslim or sth ) decided that i should not attend university , should not work in a government position , etc. 
  remember , you can do these things with a headscarf in most eu countries . 
  shouting allahu akbar should not result in a death sentence, 
  it 's really funny how putin hs actually been more aggressive towards his political opposition , civil society & the media , and how he 's always been against them , as opposed to erdogan who only `` exploded '' in the last 4 years . 
  the difference is that putin is still in a stable mental conditions , and is not a religioud nutjob . 
  no , he is not . 
  stop making these sick comparisons . 
  we also had a 300000 people protest against ttip last fall but merkel had a 60 % approval rate when that happened, 
  this sounds weird , but putin has actually attacked the political opposition , civil society and media much more than erdogan . 
  yes , turning a nato member of 80 million that borders two warzones and two eu countries into north korea makes so much sense . 
  ours is 70 %, 
  yes ... but i am on my phone so no flairs to be seen . 
  i always `` lalalala '' most of your anthem , but i can sing the first half of the main stanza so it 's cool, 
  so now will they blame everything on the parallel state ? 
  is the parallel state to blame for our mps not being allowed to do their job ? 
  actually ethnic turks have a birthrate of 1,8 and erdogan was quite worried about that, 
  woke up twenty minutes ago . 
  still ca n't comprehend what happened , what a horrible night . 
  turkish redditors , how does it feel ? 
  no , stock markets were fine , i was checking them yesterday, 
  fourth night on a row i have to stay awake past 4am ( work , work , nice , this ) . 
  i need sleep . 
  turkish redditors , our thoughts are with you . 
  god help turkey now ... this wo n't be nice . 
  it wo n't be nice at all . 
  g'night y' all . 
  yes , but with ak-47 on a live pk ? 
  let 's take a moment to think how islam traditions affected these events . 
  if this happened here , everyone would be drunk and throwing bottles at each-other . 
  reportedly not true you know shit 's gone bad if the country 's president is blatantly lying on camera, 
  fucking hell there are men with huge ak-47 behind erdogan as the pk ends , the fuck is this, 
  google translate says he mentioned a cleaning of the army , and a `` new turkey '' fuck this shit i 'm out, 
  there 's always greece, 
  stupid flair does n't work . 
  as a bayern fan , i sincerely apologize for bailing-out hansa rostock financially . 
  ... germany, 
  erdogan live on trt as i write this . 
  heavily armed people & flowers around , apparently there will be a live statement edit : he 's talking , but i only know twelve words in turkish & surprisingly , he is not talking about food so i ca n't translate, 
  hey , you can always come here for turkish food, 
  hey , funny r/soccer guy , i found you !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so0g09lfbnq&amp;feature=youtu.be i think he tried to call his mom, 
  erdogan has apparently appeared in the airport from within a vehicle, 
  the pink-shirt guy at cnn turk is so chill . 
  not surprising at all, 
  `` allah bismilah allahu akbar '' chants if i hear it correctly on cnn live stream , and that 's what turkish nationalists chant here when they protest against kurds, 
  screams and gunshots ( i think , never heard one live ) and jeers and stuff at cnn turk live stream, 
  explosion in taksim square , fuck this shit, 
  chp came out against them around 11pm , so waaay before it was clear, 
  the fuck is that video of shot people :'(, 
  cnn turk offices are emptied . 
  live stream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so0g09lfbnq&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
  found the #wengerout gunner, 
  how can we go in war against the us , we do n't have an army, 
  she was on tears half an hour ago , poor girl, 
  ** our media says erdogan has landed at ataturk **, 
  twitter says erdogan is landing right now, 
  hey , if it ai n't broke do n't fix it, 
  the eu leader should never , under * any * circumstance , support military coups against a democratically elected government in a neighboring country . 
  actually i 'd go as far as say ** no coups at all ** . 
  how did libya work out for us again ? 
  egypt ? 
  true & tragic, 
  the democratic orders means the government is changed through elections & elections only . 
  erdogan to land at ataturk, 
  i meant dangerous for the general global peace , not their careers . 
  understandable . 
  i hope your tsipras has a nice chat . 
  the blonde girl ? 
  beautiful one, 
  islamists & nationalists is the big divide in turkey , not left vs right . 
  so , dangerous, 
  no , no hidden meaning . 
  i was just saying that it 's not like anyone is expecting him to make a drastic statement . 
  he & and the rest of his colleagues will just make the general `` stability , democracy '' statement . 
  well , he wo n't have to invent his own line , he can just copy what others say, 
  you wo n't hear any gov support the coup , that would be dangerous , to say the least, 
  smarties, 
  one of our journos is saying there will be an extraordinary parliament session after some hours, 
  fellow europoors : is my gov the only non-us one who has went public about this , or is our media just too lazy to report on what other gov 's say ? 
  no one . 
  regardless of how it works out , it will be worse for turkey , us and the us . 
  bbc is showing people in what looks like the main airport, 
   seibert : the democratic order in turkey must be respected . 
  everything must be done to protect the lives of the people . 
  riot police sent to the turkish embassy in berlin as a `` precaution '' , no reports of fights yet . 
  the circle of cordoning-off is getting bigger ( dunno how to express this in english ),
