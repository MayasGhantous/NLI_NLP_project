pretty one sided . 
  remember operation barbarossa ? 
  where germans killed like 28 million russians and burned down everything in their way ? 
  i do n't think the people from syria will ever go back . 
  just empty words and no action from the eu like always , well except if it is a economical issue . 
  i 'm pro refugees and anti eu . 
  there is a reason why brussels is full of politicians who could n't make it in their home countries . 
  failures . 
  also the uk with their brexit bullshit . 
  they are one of the countries responsible for that mess and do n't take the consequences . 
  to hell with them . 
  who needs a country that only listens to some dumb right wing nutters ? 
  i like it on toast, 
  how can i send a modmail ? 
  many people in this subreddit have concerns , because posts get deleted without any reason . 
  we are not dumb . 
  i do n't feel threatened by refugees . 
  there are 250 of them living nearby in a gym temporarily and i never had a problem with them , never . 
  other countries seem to be more sensible in that regard . 
  germany has managed more difficult situations and we do n't tend to vote for right wing nutters the first second something does n't work like we want . 
  we try to make it work and do n't run away from it , thats our mentality . 
  two worlds . 
  neonazis and thankful syrians . 
  ftfy  isis is based in west germany, 
  isis is banned in germany . 
  why is n't isis banned in denmark ? 
  crazy . 
  i think we can also agree that the nsa is doing a good job in germany . 
  not a single terrorist attack so far . 
  well done . 
  people condemn these people . 
  no , but people are getting nervous when they realise that current law does not get executed . 
  and im not talking about those braindead nazis . 
  so you are telling me the faz is not a serious newspaper and they publish wrong numbers ? 
  wow , the ignorance of the left is mindblowing . 
  i 'm talking about whole germany . 
  40 % are coming from the balkans and they have no right to claim asylum . 
  these people are not only protesting for their hometown , they are also protesting against the politics in whole germany . 
  the problem is , they do n't send them back . 
  last year there were 600.000 illegal migrants in germany who were not sent back . 
  whos application for asylum was rejected . 
  i have no idea where they are from , but most people coming here have no right to claim asylum . 
  only 1/3 are getting asylum . 
  refugees yes , but not illegal migrants . 
  its getting nasty here, 
  we should send them all to brussels . 
   belgium , bulgaria , cyprus , finland , france , ** germany ** , ** greece ** , hungary , ireland , ** italy ** , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , portugal , slovenia , spain , and ** sweden ** . 
  haha , the eu is a complete joke . 
  here is the video : http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=518_1440595069 ( might be disturbing for some ), 
  does america have a law/system for immigration like canada and australia ? 
  germany is discussing such a system with points for skilled immigrants from outside of europe at the moment . 
  i always read about hand grenades in sweden , but are we talking here about self-made bombs or real grenades ? 
  the only country i would consider moving to is australia . 
  only a few problems 1 ) too many animals/insects who can kill you 2 ) too far away and different time zone . 
  you are always online when everyone else in the western world sleeps 3 ) christmas in summer , really ? 
  that said , i 'm staying here . 
  you know what 's even more embarassing ? 
  trying to blame me for spelling . 
  have a good day sir . 
  they are serbian . 
  i do n't care if they are gypsies or not . 
  serbs do n't have a right to claim asylum here . 
  that 's why they are considered serbian , albanian , romanian etc here . 
  it 's about nationality not ethnicity . 
  according to most serbs here , every serb coming to germany is a gypsie . 
  am i wrong ? 
  i bet my english is better than your german . 
  im just pissed at the moment pardon . 
  not worth wasting my time with a dumb yankie boy . 
  gobble some cheeseburgers and shut your mouth . 
  you mean it takes a few dumb yanks to mess the whole middle east up . 
  can you stop asking questions ? 
  i love germany , hate the eu . 
  why should i leave ? 
  `` you gave us euro '' . 
  that was france not germany . 
  france demanded that germany adopts the euro as a requirement for reunification . 
  eu will collapse anyway soon and we do n't have to pay for your shithole country anymore . 
  no , i will just wait till the eu collapses . 
  who cares about `` everyone else '' ? 
  you do n't seem to care about the few countries either who take huge burdens upon themselves with migrants at the moment . 
  everyone can print money and pile up debt . 
  doesnt mean your economy is good . 
  we should just leave that club full of retards . 
  you fucking gypsie are part of the problem . 
  tell your friends to stay in your country and dont come here . 
  fuck the us . 
  we should team up with russia in the future . 
  let the yankie boys do their thing alone . 
  yes , but this time we got a real problem and it will likely not go away anytime soon . 
  that 's why they want to build hotspots in greece and italy until the end of the year . 
  it was n't just a normal economic crisis , it was the treaty of versailles that caused hyperinflation and misery upon millions of germans . 
  pretty sure there would have been no nsdap and wwii without the treaty of versailles . 
  me too . 
  our politicians already said they are willing to stop all funding for eastern europe . 
  you are wrong . 
  germany is helping to rescue migrants with our navy and we are also taking in lots of migrants at the moment . 
  sweden and austria are also taking in many . 
  i think it has something to do with decency to give asylum to people who flee from war . 
  germany has managed way more difficult situations and it would be laughable if we could not do so again .
