  the one in berlin is called `` berliner schnauze '' . 
  idiots . 
  let the police do their job . 
  lol prost !, 
  yup , my favourite as a kid was marshmallow -  microwave lol, 
  interesting , weird and at the same time logical and mouth-watering . 
  exactly my type of thing !, 
  no matter what i love scotland . 
  btw `` deep-fried mars '' ... tell me more about it, 
  belgium is great . 
  we are blessed with good neighbors i have to say . 
  japan are our asian bros, 
  it tastes better than it sounds , promise . 
  i will when i get the chance , but what i meant was that not everywhere in germany it is a typical dish . 
  at least where i live it is n't . 
  pork knuckle is famous in southern germany while in the north they eat more fish for example . 
  the pole is not far away when the german and russian talk lol . 
  i thought its russian . 
  every russian restaurant here serves borschtsch . 
  borschtsch ? 
  sauerkraut and sausages are fine , but nothing special . 
  maybe i would also like pork knuckle or as we say `` schweinshaxe '' which is stereotypical german food , because everyone thinks germany = bavaria lol . 
  my favourite german food is roast pork , dumplings and red cabbage . 
  pork knuckle . 
  answer : never, 
  legalize it . 
  problem solved . 
  amnesty international are a bunch of hypocrites . 
  how many of them are opening their homes for refugees ? 
  lebanon gives shelter for a lot of refugees . 
  admirable . 
  this reads like that anti-immigration video from our government for the balkan migrants . 
  dont come here its shiet . 
  anyway , some rain wo n't deter me . 
  we will see . 
  many of them are sleeping in tents at the moment with warm climate . 
  in oktober this will not be possible anymore . 
  those numbers are flawed . 
  most immigrants are coming from eu countries . 
  others are asylumseekers and the majority of them ca n't stay . 
  who ? 
  atleast we do n't speak schluchtenscheisserisch !, 
  that 's rolladen and not some random piece of beef , 
  http://www.forbes.com/sites/raoulruparel/2015/07/22/bernanke-german-trade-surplus/ france export partners : germany 16.7 % , belgium 7.5 % , italy 7.5 % , spain 6.9 % , uk 6.9 % , us 5.6 % , netherlands 4.3 %, 
  that trade surplus is generated outside of the eu .

  it was the answer on your article you just shared . 
  `` global risks loom '' because of 0.1 % growth . 
  yeep . 
  it is as if my trade union told me to expect that my income ( $ 10,000 per annum ) would increase by $ 30 in the last quarter . 
  instead it only increased by $ 20 . 
  what an absolute , total disaster . 
  0.4 or 0.5 hardly a big deal . 
  probably a rounding error . 
  dutch economy beat the french with sensational 0.1 % growth !, 
  is it possible to get this in english ? 
  35 \u00b0 c here . 
  russians and germans are both not very resentful . 
  not country but * reich *, 
  i 'm surprised they even said british and not just english . 
  this step is only logical and was foreseeable from the beginning . 
  just when i thought you guys are already there bringing some good old american freedom and democracy . 
  but honestly , yes we got a problem and colonization does n't pay off without slavery . 
  good old times eh . 
  i learned something from you , so do n't mind the other people who feel `` offended '' . 
  those jets are fully insured . 
  the eur is low mainly because of the ecb printing money and buying bonds . 
  thats true yes, 
  you surely mean bavaria and austria ? 
  northern germany has more in common with other countries like netherlands , denmark than with austria . 
  what 's more confusing is that a italian brand sells `` speck '' which is bacon in german . 
  well said . 
  those evil germans at it again, 
  certainly not , but then again i do n't know what it was like living in germany in that period of time . 
  the propaganda machine was running well and most of the cruelties and its dimensions of the nazis were mostly revealed only after the war . 
  what boggles my mind is that some politicians here are calling the defeat in wwii `` liberation '' . 
  the majority of germans even decades after the war felt defeated not liberated . 
  you know , most of them supported the nazis , voted for them , fought for them etc. 
  it 's just bullshit propaganda nowadays . 
  you just sound like a spoiled child , that 's all . 
  and with your broken english i even doubt you 're american . 
  but then again i would n't be surprised if you were . 
  lol u mad ? 
  sir , i have to apologize for that comment . 
  it will not happen again . 
  i think other countries are more likely to start a war than germany . 
  look no further than your own . 
  our economy does n't rely on wars . 
   `` from now on germany will primarily pursue its national interests , just like everybody else . '' and this is bad because ? 
   aug 8th 2015 | berlin and knossos | from the print it is from the future !, 
  portugal is quite a unique country . 
  that 's a plus in my books . 
  already was there several times and its wonderful . 
  what about spain and brazil ? 
  can confirm, 
  ah well enjoy your palm oil cheese, 
  not yet and france i was only in strasbourg , 
  i 've been to : * netherlands * france * italy * spain * austria * switzerland * greece i want to visit all of europe of course .
