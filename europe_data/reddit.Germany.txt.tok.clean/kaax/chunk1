very interesting , but why was the greek pm talking in french ? 
  thanks for this piece of research . 
  why should the austrian company comply ? 
  latvian banks have a residence program for 300k eur : https://www.rietumu.lv/en/residence-permit as long as the money is kept in a term deposit , `` upon expiry of the term of residence permit investors and their family members are eligible to apply for the renewal . '', 
  after some years one can apply for naturalization and gain full latvian citizenship . 
  how does unaccounted `` dark '' business money fit into this ? 
  is there a spike in the illegal economy since the depression started ? 
  i 'm still waiting for the european start-ups to pop up . 
  i mean talk about timing . 
  i realize that the language i used is pretty generalizing and unfair . 
  but i heard it from different relatives living in different villages that it 's pretty intense in the last few years . 
   not sure about the numbers , but i suspect is not 40 but 4 millions ...  i got my numbers mixed up a bit , you 're right . 
  portuguese population = 31.2 million 11 million living in europe means there are 20million portuguese living outside of portugal , not 40 . 
   the military had the power and gave it up to the people . 
  it was not a political revolution even if today , most politicians would like us to believe that . 
  that 's why i said with the `` support of the military '' . 
  i did n't want to take anything away from the citizens . 
   we fought in ww1 . 
  we were aligned with entente . 
  after further research i fixed that . 
  it was quite more action going on than i knew about . 
  - population only 11 million but 20 million immigrants living outside - huge exporter of azulejos ( [ portuguese trainstation ] ( http://ipt.olhares.com/data/big/87/877134.jpg ) ) ; i was in iquitos , a city in the amazonian jungle in peru and there was a district with huge mansions ( now home to government facilities and military ) that were covered in wonderful portuguese azulejos - napoleon tried to bring his continental system to portugal but was told to gtfo ( anglo-portuguese ties were pretty strong since the 13th century ) - 1910 democratic revolution -  first republic with anti-catholic acts and laws . 
  this lasted for less than two decades , before a coup led to the formation of the second republic which became the new state of salazar ( fascist ) in 1933 that freezed portugals economy and power influence massively repression led to the peaceful '' [ carnation revolution ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/fb7555c3a707b82c171c636504b21d14/tumblr_mlrnchmejn1s2sshgo4_250.jpg ) '' in 1974 led by the left wing with military support - dragonball is ingrained in every kids mind - [ pasteis de nata ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/margaretcafe_pasteisdenata.jpg/220px-margaretcafe_pasteisdenata.jpg ) - very traditional villages with folcloric festivals celebrating for example `` nossa senhora da sa\u00fade '' ( our godess of health ) - vinho do porto - amazing place for surfers all around the world , great beaches - the biggest shopping mall in europe is in lisbon ( that 's what they told me ) - economic crisis catapulted robbery and theft even in the small face-to-face villages - soccer is treated by men as a substitute for religion - fucking delicious [ gambas ] ( http://recettessimples.fr/images/gambas%20poelees.jpg ) everywhere - neutrality in world war 2 - has approved co-parent adoption by same-sex couples - very successful drug decriminalization laws - i was told that there was a campaign to name the huge bridge now named 25 de abril ( date of revolution ) to `` ass of salazar '' , so that everyone leaving or entering lisbon would have the chance to rail salazars ass - portuguese invented the caravels - portuguese ca n't spell `` knife '' - do n't ever talk about `` morangos com a\u00e7ucar '' with anyone, 
  \u00c7ay came from portugal ? 
  you mean the traditional way of making \u00c7ay in turkey is derived from the recipe of portuguese ? 
  he 's conditioning us for the great asian invasion . 
  the `` think of the children '' card is played way too often in politics for my taste .

  awesomeness . 
  contingencies from hn wrote : when discussing government signals intelligence programs with the average person , the industrial espionage point is often a very good one with which to sway skeptics who consider individual privacy concerns and totalitarianism-potential too ephemeral to take as serious threats . 
  it is unfortunate , though , that the subject is generally , as within the eu report document , framed within a nationalist perspective - nationalism itself being something of a time-honoured trap for the same class of victim . 
  my most favoured quote of late is einstein 's description of nationalism : an infantile disease ; the measles of humanity . 
  our generation 's challenge is to conquer this . 
  i 'm already failing at trying to find a clever name .

   the promised increases in yield and pest resistance have n't materialized 49 peer reviewed studies on gm crops worldwide summarised that on average , farmers in developed countries experienced increase in yield of 6 % and in underdeveloped countries of 29 % . ^ ^ [ 1,2 ] tillage was decreased by 25 -- 58 % on herbicide resistant soybeans , insecticide applications on bt crops were reduced by 14 -- 76 % and 72 % of farmers worldwide experienced positive economic results . 
  another yield gain can be seen with the planting of glyphosate-resistant crops . 
  it allowed farmers to plant rows closer together as they did not have to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage . ^ ^ [ 3 ] ^ ^ [ 1 ] [ ^ peer-reviewed ^ surveys ^ indicate ^ positive ^ impact ^ of ^ commercialized ^ gm ^ crops ] ( http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n4/full/nbt0410-319.html ) ^ ^ [ 2 ] [ ^ slide ^ presentation ^ of ^ article ^ in ^ nature ^ biotechnology ] ( http://www.ask-force.org/web/benefits/carpenter-peer-reviewed-surveys-2010.ppt ) ^ ^ [ 3 ] ^ http://www.hpj.com/archives/2010/aug10/aug2/0716seedmacoaug2sr.cfm, 
  the co-inventor of the genetically engineered , vitamin-a-rich strain of rice potrykus has spearheaded an effort to have golden rice distributed for free to poor farmers . 
  this required several companies which had intellectual property rights to the results of beyer 's research to license it for free . 
  monsanto was one of the first companies to grant free licenses . 
  if the substinence farmer does n't make more than $ 10,000 per year , he is freed from paying any royalities . 
  the farmers are even permitted to keep and replant the seeds . 
  this is in the specific case of golden rice . 
  maybe somebody can jump in and tell a horrific monsanto story . 
  i 'm waiting to hear the reason why everybody is so up in arms about it . 
  if i try to google it , all i get is really scummy sites where they say that 1 million indian farmers commit suicide every year because of monsanto without a source . 
  i hope somebody can educate me on the downsides of monsanto . 
  preferably with evidence and sources . 
  i entered the linked website in the reddit search field . 
  until naturalnews.com gives him the ok . 
  is this now shadowbanned ?

  what ? 
  are you being serious ? 
  this somehow makes me feel a little better . 
  at least there is someone getting happy while we 're miserable . 
  [ literally just watched this , more or less relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpambpq8j7g ), 
  it 's the most ridiculous statement i 've heard so far regarding this issue . 
  germany 's domestic intelligence agency estimates that as of 2010 there were about 1,400 far-right extremists in mecklenburg-western pomerania -- a small fraction of the state 's 1.6 million population . 
  of them , 400 are npd members . 
  still , officials acknowledge the far-right extremists in the state make up a disproportionate number of germany 's overall 26,000 . 
  that said the elected representative of the npd sven krueger is a real joke . 
  in his political center there is a huge grill in the backyard with the words ` happy holocaust ' shrink-wrapped into it . 
  a vice documentary about jamel asked him about this and he was trying to convince the interviewer that he had no idea about it . 
  even though it 's more than obvious that it 's the political party hq where he and his comrades plan political campaigns etc. 
  i 'm really surprised about switzerland . 
  what is going on ? 
  the backlash from religious folks would be unbearable i think . 
  in germany the current party in charge is cdu , which stands for christian democratic union . 
  ` shaun39 ' pointed something out that i find interesting . 
  here is his comment : the bulk of the price variation is in the diversity of transmission fees , consumer charges , connection charges , etc. 
  for a better idea of the underlying price of electricity ( the stuff that 's actually trading ) rather than retail & dist overheads , better to [ look at industrial electricity prices .

  but there probably are n't ; knowing italy , there 'll be taxes and regulations driving prices up to ridiculous levels . 
  scandinavian energy is super-cheap because of abundant hydroelectricity , because of competition between both local and russian gas , and also because of nuclear . 
  bulgarian , romanian and french electricity are all much cheaper than they otherwise would be , because of the large presence of legacy nuclear plants churning out almost-free electricity from deprecated capital . 
  i 'm not sure why things are pricier in the uk and ireland . 
  first guess : that might owe something to the tendency for banks to prefer consumers over businesses , and for investors to traditionally demand higher yields ( higher cost of capital adds massively to the cost of power ) . 
  second guess : island effect and lower number of cross-border transmission lines reduces the number of competitors on the market , resulting in higher costs & prices . 
  if those two causal factors are prominent , there might not be an easy policy answer . 
  * edit * : fixed the link to industrial electricity prices . 
  four doses of rabies vaccine are enough to prevent infection exposed to the rabies virus . 
  [ the duration of immunity afforded to humans by a two injection vaccination course was found to be between two to three years . 
  following administration of a booster dose ( recommended at one year ) , one study found 97 % of immuno-competent individuals demonstrate protective levels of neutralizing antibodies at 10 years .

  maybe he is very stringent with his rabies shots ? 
  a figure of speech we have in germany translates loosely to `` the fat years are over ! '', 
  depending on how much their making . 
  i would n't wish harsh penalties on someone that 's avoiding taxes to maybe , just maybe afford a 1-week vacation every 2 years .
