[ so you went and created another post on cb to complain about us . ], 
  ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3luv49/the_reurope_mods_kicked_norrisobe_who_asked_for/ ) brigade incoming i guess . 
  the responses are exactly what you can expect from circlebroke users :  [ just unsubscribe and move on . 
  that subreddit has been lost to the 4chan/pol/mra cancer . 
  let spineless bigots like slyratchet taste the shitsoup they have been brewing . 
  ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3luv49/the_reurope_mods_kicked_norrisobe_who_asked_for/cv9jg58 ) if that place seems moderate to you , then i suggest you take the gentleman 's advice . 
  ** [ reddit study : shitredditsays is site 's most toxic thread ] ( http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/20/reddit-study-shitredditsays-is-sites-most-toxic-thread-theredpill-is-most-bigoted/ ) **, 
  that 's the equivalent of saying src is n't rightwing . 
  ragnar_ok himself said : ** `` cb is literally srs-lite '' ** in the thread . 
  ** [ reddit study : shitredditsays is site 's most toxic thread ] ( http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/20/reddit-study-shitredditsays-is-sites-most-toxic-thread-theredpill-is-most-bigoted/ ) **, 
   this post [ 1 ] sums up the problem quite well . 
  basically : `` you must understand that the spectrum of opinions does n't reach from reasonable opinion a to reasonable opinion b , it reaches from open and reasonable opinion ( my opinion ) to hateful despicable opinion ( most other users ) . '', 
  this mindset is not constructive , it is wholly immature . 
  he then goes on with yet more claims that / r/europe is dominated by brigades , even though this has been denied by the admins of reddit . 
  it was n't that in the beginning , but it developed into a circlejek sub for radical left users , yes . 
  the guy is a moderator of / r/circlebroke , which is bad enough in itself , but it 's especially aggravating in light of norrisobe 's recent request at cb for ` help ' against immigration posters . 
  [ / r/europe mod here . 
  we need your help . 
  / r/europe has been taken over by immispam ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3lf9pc/reurope_mod_here_we_need_your_help_reurope_has/ ) this was ragnars response as moderator :  [ this post is against the rules but i 'll leave it up in hopes that more people can give good suggestions . 
  / r/europe is used to be a cool place , i 'd like to see it like that again . 
  ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3lf9pc/reurope_mod_here_we_need_your_help_reurope_has/cv5tb6n ) and :  [ give it here , cb is literally srs-lite , i 'll clean it up good !, 
  ] ( https://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3lf9pc/reurope_mod_here_we_need_your_help_reurope_has/cv5ss0f ) yeah that sounds promising ... we need cool headed moderators to improve / r/europe , not a fanatic from a political fringe group . 
  * edit . 
  * it should n't go unsaid that the others all seem like serious people , that i can get behind . 
  just sayin , 
  that 's like george bush saying middle eastern stability is in danger . 
  / r/subredditdrama is leaking . 
  it 's just how media works . 
  whether we like it or not , aylan kurdi has become the face of the refugee crisis . 
  his picture and story has far greater impact on the public discourse than numbers and statistics . 
   al arabiya was started in response to qatar 's pan-arab satellite channel al jazeera ... al arabiya has been criticized for being an arm of saudi foreign policy , or what the united states would term public diplomacy , as it is seen as being part of `` a concerted saudi attempt to dominate the world of cable and satellite television media in the arab world and steal the thunder of egypt '' . 
  not the royals themselves , but saudi owned international media such as al arabiya , example : - [ refugee death scenes are the west 's moral failure ] ( http://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-east/2015/08/30/how-to-confront-the-refugee-crisis-macabre-death-scenes.html ) and the same goes for qatar with their al jazeera , example : - [ if these images do n't change europe , what will ? 
  ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/images-don-change-europe-150902220504564.html ), 
  a country that prohibits churches and all other non-islamic temples , while funding the construction of mosques all over europe , and elsewhere . 
  a country that prohibits non-muslims from holding citizenship , and punishes atheism by execution , while saudi owned media constantly accuses europe of islamophobia . 
  a country that has accepted 0 refugees from syria , while accusing europe of being heartless . 
  it 's our close friend and ally in the war against terrorism , the kingdom of saudi arabia !, 
  before someone removes this , some more sources : http://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/har-vagrar-romson-svara-pa-varfor-kaplan-fick-ga http://www.svd.se/romson-11-september-en-olycka/om/sverige http://www.thelocal.se/20160419/swedens-deputy-pm-defends-911-accident-gaffe, 
  i 'm also worried that this scenario would pull the afd further to the right . 
  what germany needs more than anything is a * moderate * counterbalance to merkel 's project , like csu but national . 
  great analysis , bro . 
  realistically , there 's no way to guarantee the safety of an openly gay person inside a refugee center . 
  segregation is the least shitty option . 
  no , she said police could use their firearm as a last resort . 
  that poll is about whether merkel should resign or not , it 's not a poll of how many agree with the open door policy . 
  support for merkel does not equate support for immigration . 
  in fact [ 90 % of the people who vote cdu/csu are against merkel 's open door policy ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151292400/neun-von-zehn-unions-waehlern-lehnen-merkels-asylkurs-ab.html ) . 
  the list of serious items is still including e.g. 
  ` offensive jokes ' in the same category as actual assault . 
  this kind of methodology does more to obfuscate serious problems , than to illuminate them , imo . 
  questions included in the survey  \u2022 inappropriate invitations to go out on dates ? 
   \u2022 intrusive questions about your private life that made you feel offended ? 
  six months ago , the guardian was pondering whether it was ok to even use the word ` migrants ' . 
  [ we deride them as ` migrants ' . 
  why not call them people ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/28/migrants-people-refugees-humanity ) goalposts have moved rapidly in recent months , eventually they 'll catch up with reality . 
  europe gives more weight to a statistically representative population survey , than an individual crime story ? 
  how terrible !, 
   [ one in 3 men in pakistan believes that raping a boy is neither a crime , nor a bad thing ] ( http://www.reshareit.com/raping-boys-is-not-wrong-as-believed-by-pakistani-men/ ) we have to put cultural relativism behind us for good . 
  it places ideals above facts , and the consequences of this are no joke . 
  we need to take cultural compatibility much more into account , when deciding on immigration policies . 
  seehofer , the leader of csu , sums it up nicely : * [ `` chancellors in an advanced stage of their office only believe in themselves '' ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-merkel-iduskcn0v10mq ) * poll shows [ 90 % of cdu/csu voters reject ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article151292400/neun-von-zehn-unions-waehlern-lehnen-merkels-asylkurs-ab.html ) her open door policy , but merkel seems increasingly impervious to others views on the issue . 
  not the first time : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/next_german_federal_election#opinion_polls, 
  psychopaths are [ overrepresented ] ( http://www.alternet.org/culture/10-careers-most-psychopaths ) among surgeons . 
  it does n't say what his specialty was , but i 'm guessing he was a surgeon . 
  i think we should do both . 
  now what am i to do with all this popcorn i just made ? 
   cannabis-based oh shit , reddit is gon na hate this . 
  short translation : 26-year old selina was sexually assaulted on nye . 
  in a tv interview , she said that her assailants were arabs . 
  someone made a video with clips of her , accusing her of being a racist and far-right , and includes her full identification , which he had found through research . 
  it went viral on internet and social media . 
  it reaches the point , where selina starts receiving threatening phone calls . 
  the video appears on the facebook page of a known radical islamist , and selina is starting to fear for her safety . 
  fortunately , she has found out who the original creator of the video is , and may take him to court . 
  [ the solution is obvious ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k8lkcfw.jpg ), 
   `` we , the united people of the jungle , calais , respectfully decline the demands of the french government with regards to reducing the size of the jungle , '' they said in a statement . 
  you ca n't make this stuff up . 
  i 'm not so sure about that . 
  this is the first time in her career that she appears to be very emotionally invested in a political cause . 
  the pragmatic and calculating tactician we 're used to , is gone . 
  i do n't think she 's planning on running for chancellor again , i think this is about a desire to put her name into the history books . 
   if your entire panel only consists of people who earn below average ( which is highly likely given the tiny incentives ) they draw * representative samples * from a huge pool of respondents . 
  and their recent track record of accuracy speaks for itself . 
   and the inconsistencies compared to all ( ! ), 
  other german polling institutes is well established . 
  yes , it is like that in all european countries . 
  in practically every election , yougov and sentio ( similar methodology ) predicts higher support for anti-immigration-parties , and the predictions of yougov + sentio are * consistently * closer to the actual election results of these parties , than traditional polling firms . 
   i 'd appreciate it if you 'd inform yourself before downvoting next time . 
  this is not a matter of opinion . 
  what you wrote about their methodology is factually wrong . 
  read any explanation of yougov 's methodology . 
  https://yougov.co.uk/about/panel-methodology/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yougov#methodology, 
  that is flat out wrong . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yougov  the company 's methodology involves obtaining responses from an invited group of internet users , and then weighting these responses in line with demographic information . 
  it draws these demographically-representative samples from a panel of 4 million people worldwide including over 750,000 people in the uk . 
  in fact , yougov generally has a better track record of predicting support for anti-immigration parties , as their methodology negates the ` shy tory factor ' , while still being just as demographically representative as traditional polling methods . 
  even so , yougov tends to * underestimate * the support for anti-immigration parties during elections , but much less so than traditional polling firms . 
  few people care about that circus at all . 
  the data are from yougov , not bild .
