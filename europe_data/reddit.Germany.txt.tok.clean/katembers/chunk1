even more ? 
  do n't do g20 kids , it 's bad for you !, 
  nothing as iconic as merkel with her wardrobe and that thing she does with her hands . 
  i , honestly , do n't give a single fuck what they do with their life . 
  none of my business . 
  i just find it a bit annoying to always see the most stereotypical case of transwoman they can find , instead of the average person . 
  it 's like putting a picture of a red-haired scot in a kilt playing his bagpipe on every article that is remotely dealing with scotland . 
  given that there are between 0,1 and 0,5 % of the population who are transgender , this is ridiculously few . 
  do n't ask me !, 
  this title is unnecessarily long and precise . 
  let 's liberate those commies and anarchists !, 
  ohhh , well , that explains it . 
  a bit deceiving , though , and does n't say much at all . 
  it 's quite obvious that a country like germany with 81 million inhabitants will have more people in absolute terms than norway with 5 million ... 
   around 100 men are said to belong to the violent group . 
  ` * cough * ` immediate deportation ` * cough * `, 
  wikipedia says it 's mostly in scandinavia , but i have nothing to prove any of those neither wrong nor right . 
  so i 'll just leave it at that . 
  what does i1 even do ? 
  i love how detailed this map is , clearly making a difference between greek and turkish islands , marking ceuta as spanish , etc. 
  germany wanted to do that with the deadline being 2030 the past few years . 
  want * ed * . 
  i could find a 37,5 % vodka in my mum 's `` secret '' closet . 
  is that enough ? 
  is there a % alc that 's considered optimal for this ? 
  should i get 2 % or 5 % ? 
  was it really that bad that people started to kill each others ? 
  o.o i 'm inclined to call this a small civil war o.o, 
  can eu into anonymous alcoholics group ? 
  i have n't drunken any alcoholics in almost a week , though o.o, 
  what happened between '92 and '94 that it exploded like that ? 
  possible , not going to argue against that, 
  yes , indeed . 
  maybe because they 're party of the former dictatorship . 
  east germany used to be too , but they 're voting right-wing today o.o, 
   east is poorer and more conservative , they usually vote left . 
  this is curious , here * ( austria/germany ) * those areas typically vote right-wing or far-right-wing . 
  and occupied by the french, 
  why the difference between west and east ? 
  just more/less conservative ? 
  wealthy ? 
  yea , living in saxony, 
  lol , why not, 
  i wrote so many applications and got not a single positive response , so i 'm happy if i 'd get any job at all , regardless of payment . 
  i got a pop-up with may on there  .  * blacklisted *, 
  the issue is following : your own basic rights need to be violated that you 're able to sue . 
  not the case here . 
  it depends on the treaties between the 3 involved countries . 
  some allow it , some do n't , some allow it only for some time . 
  yea , not great . 
  but at least they can do it at all without going to prison . 
  < 3 europe < 3, 
  at least we have legal prostitution \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af, 
  honestly , after unsuccessfully writing dozens of applications , i 'd be grateful for the 8,84 $ minimum wage as well . 
  about 3 years ago my city had a 10 % unemployment rate , and again even more than that were underemployed . 
  aka , almost a fourth of the city could n't work enough to sustain themselves properly . 
  it has gotten better recently , but it 's still extreme . 
  we 're grateful for every single job we still have . 
  we 're in need of at least 25000 more though . 
  we can even provide cheap housing ~ ~ because almost half of the population just noped out of here in the past 75 years ~ ~ . 
  at least a third of germany does n't even have jobs for the healthy and willing . 
  i should move to norway . 
  unfortunately, 
  then the bverfg better hurry the fuck up and jail half of the bundestag for violating the gg, 
  they 've got my vote anyway , but as i never honestly heard them saying terribly much against it . 
  to me it seems they 're only liberal when it comes to reducing state-influence over their own companies ... 
  i 'm just saying that we 're certainly more spied upon by our own governments than we are by russia . 
  i 'm very much in favor of kicking this entire government out of the country . 
  their continuous violation of basic human rights is disgusting . 
  please somebody save us ... 
  but who , nobody 's really better ... 
  i think we should look at what 's happening in our own countries first ... russia is our least problem when it comes to surveillance . 
  the west, 
  that moment when the people propagating for keeping the western values have less western values than those they oppose . 
   the lot is not an exclave as it is not sovereign czech territory . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't want to be a minority in my own country . 
  without being racist , i 'm honestly quite happy about living in an area with few to none muslims . 
  yea , it seems very bad indeed, 
  just asking out of curiousness . 
  they constantly talk about areas where you ca n't go anymore because there 's too much islam , but never show any evidence . 
  this guy knows how to make friends . 
  is this one of the no-go zones those alt-right nazis talk about all the time ? 
  yea, 
  same sex marriage :d, 
  +1 for helping me take over this / r/europe thread with german flairs xd, 
  ss-chickens on the dark side of the moon conspiring against erdogan , i knew it all along !, 
  give me gimp and 2 minutes time and i can do that a lot better :|, 
  i 'd bitch-slap myself for not protecting my printer with a password, 
  you would n't need gas masks for usual pyro  .  looks like pepper spray . 
  because in the eyes of the new turkish dictatorship all germans are still evil nazis . 
  ~ ~ ^ my ^ feels ~ ~, 
  what genius was in charge of making that guy 's id-card anonymous ? 
  he/she must be as blatantly stupid as the leader/sultan he/she probably works for . 
  well that 's a cute little parliament you 've got there \\ ^ \\ ^ how many do fit in there , like 30 ? 
  she was forced to do that , actually . 
  all somewhat liberal parties made same-sex marriage a hard-requirement for the coalitions for the upcoming elections . 
  without this vote today legalizing it , she would not get a coalition in september , hence she would 've lost her spot . 
  she had to sacrifice her holy marriage between a man and a woman in favor of her 4 ^ th term . 
  that way , with governments becoming more transparent , here 's few chance for them to go against human rights .
