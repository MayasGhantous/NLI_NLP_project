  please do n't expect me to take a 12 yo in a jersey serious when he talks about something that takes most people 6 to 8 years of high-school history lessons to get only slightly familiar with this topic . 
  sorry dude , but you are/have not the right age/profession/maturity yet . 
  i 'm very much in favor of giving all whistleblowers , no matter from where they are or who they harmed , at least a life-long visa for the eu . 
  the alcohol in their blood makes them immortal, 
  unless confronted with finland . 
  they 're even more invincible . 
  never said i want them here, 
  they need it , honestly, 
  let them marry , let them adopt . 
  just fucking give them the very same rights as hetero couples . 
  is the term * `` equality '' * really that vague ? 
  by wishing to nullify human rights she more or less turns into one of the people she wants to fight , in my eyes at least . 
  people have the impression that they want to prohibit everything . 
  i do n't know anybody , and have never known anybody , who would 've needed that . 
  like you need visual proof an attack happened :|, 
  this is the perfect example of how cctvs do n't help until it 's already too late anyway and only infringe personal freedom otherwise . 
  there 's green , but people kinda associate them with wanting to prohibit everything . 
  there 's linke , but they 're a bit too far left for many people . 
  there 's fdp , but they 're the ones giving companies more freedom so that they can screw people over . 
  honestly , none . 
  if i was forced to choose , probably linke , gr\u00fcne or spd . 
  and only because the others are too right-wing for me . 
  i never said i 'm a fan of spd either . 
  neither am i a fan of linke with their past . 
  neither am i fan of fdp with their approach to social issues . 
  neither am i fan of afd and npd with their populist far-right ideals . 
  in a few areas , yes . 
  but almost all people i 've met are far , far , far more left than cdu/csu . 
  that 's my fucking point !, 
  they vote for her , although she does n't even remotely fit their political ideals . 
  yes , that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  the average german is too liberal for her party , but they still vote for her for some weird reason . 
  i so desperately hope somebody *** finally *** chases cdu/csu out of the country . 
  no idea why so many idiots vote for them . 
  they 're far too conservative and authoritarian for the average german . 
  yet , merkel is in her god-damn 3 ^ rd term and about to win her 4 ^ th ... 
  yea , but they have by far one of the lowest eu-approval rates of the entire eu . 
   oliticians from the governing coalition of cdu , csu and spd say the new law is necessary to keep up with terrorists and other criminals you do n't ensure your freedom by giving it up . 
  did n't think that far , honestly xd, 
  turkey has made a great leap backward, 
  ` usd * 0.893 = eur ` roughly ` / 10 ` and ` * 9 ` . 
  i prefer a center-populist with questionable values over a right-extremist with despicable views . 
  clearly a better guy than le pen . 
  everybody spies on everybody . 
  could 've told you earlier . 
  no , this would n't be considered okay . 
  but * `` xyz got talent '' * moderators are either sexy women or old douchebags, 
  sovereignty as a measure to circumvent human rights ? 
  i 'd like to add that it was n't some random court , but the court of human rights . 
  that elevates this issue to another level . 
  we 're not talking about some random thing here , it 's a severe violation of human rights . 
  we do . 
  economy , political influence , army, 
  we 'd right out rise to # 1 world power, 
  so , we should genocide all refugees ? 
  new pakistan , why not, 
  violence is only the cause of more violence . 
  give me one occasion where violence brought long-lasting peace, 
  anger will only lead to more anger . 
  you need to use peace to achieve peace . 
  ` * cough * ` one-way ticket back to the shithole he crawled out of ` * cough * `, 
  anger is not the solution, 
  nope, 
  ** s ** he, 
  i 'm german and under -15 \u00b0 c is kinda usual to me \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  yes ; - ;, 
  i had hope in them , but they disappointed me entirely, 
  looks beautiful < 3, 
  since when is turkey pro-lgbt ? 
  the old testament is a crucial part of christianity and directly incorporated from judaism ... btw , both islam and christianity stem from the same beliefs . 
  which christianity copy-pasted and incorporated, 
  does n't need much commenting ... 
  it 's just sad to see . 
  no , of course not . 
  my opinion of this dictator is just very , very low, 
  we 're also letting nazis demonstrate . 
  freedom of demonstrating and such . 
  where do those 2 say that i support terrorism ? 
  i just said that no religion is innocent . 
  you know that christianity is based on judaism , do you ? 
  but what do i even expect from you . 
  sure , just a bit stunned that you were so surprised with many other plates around . 
  are we ? 
  since when ? 
  i would n't be surprised if he 's involved in it, 
  [ for anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death ; he has cursed his father or his mother ; his blood is upon him . 
  ] ( http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm ) [ `` if a man commits adultery with the wife of his neighbor , both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death . 
  ] ( http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm ) [ if a man lies with his father 's wife , he has uncovered his father 's nakedness ; both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood is upon them . 
  ] ( http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-11.htm ) [ if a man lies with his daughter-in-law , both of them shall surely be put to death ; they have committed perversion ; their blood is upon them . 
  ] ( http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-12htm ) [ if a man lies with a male as with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination ; they shall surely be put to death ; their blood is upon them . 
  ] ( http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-12htm ) shall i go on with quoting leviticus ? 
  now it 's your turn . 
  where did i say terrorism is okay ? 
  where , huh ? 
  give me some proof . 
  there 's quite a lot of cars from nl , though . 
  and some from ch in the south-west  . , 
  read through leviticus 20 if you want . 
  clearly calls for murder . 
  now , where 's the quote where i support terrorism ?
