  or to put it in your language : you 're fake news, 
  good so !, 
  where do i do that ? 
  can you give me a quote ? 
  a link ? 
  btw , people who post on / r/the _ donald are n't welcome here, 
  all , depending on how you interpret it, 
  no , not really . 
  religion itself is n't bad . 
  it 's only when it used as an apology for violence or incorporated into a country, 
  true . 
  islam is a shitshow , but others are n't * that * much better, 
  do n't play by eu rules , do n't get eu benefits . 
  your own fault if we do n't care about you anymore sooner or later . 
  that moment when non-germans are more confident of the german chancellor than germans themselves . 
  state + religion = bad -- no matter which one it is . 
  25 \u00b0 c in places like sweden , norway , latvia , or finland are quite something . 
  they 're not used to it . 
  on the other hand , i 've heard many spaniards/italians say * `` omg , 10 \u00b0 c , it 's so fucking cold !, 
  '' * while it gets literally 40 \u00b0 c colder than that in those places . 
  latvia and russia are on the same page concerning lgbt people, 
  can somebody tell latvia that lgbt is okay ? 
  as listed in the eu human rights ? 
  why am i not surprised , given what country that comes from ... 
  in other words , trump has made you lose every last bit of your hope . 
  i 'll agree that most kings , emperors , and other dictators focused rather on their country , nation , religion or ethnicity . 
  most of them were right-wing after all , and that 's just a trait of right-wing people . 
  however , there were terrible left-wing dictators too who said they just want the best for humanity . 
  just read any official statement by the soviet government . 
  they 're always something along the lines of * `` for the good of everybody '' * . 
  i mean , everybody says they have the best interests of their target group at heart . 
  literally everybody . 
  all i 'm saying , many of their members used to be part of sed , and their ideology wo n't really have changed that much . 
  hard-left is a nice way of sugar-coating their past and their fundamental ideals, 
  fptp ? 
  what ? 
  damn , this is insane . 
  all i 'm saying is that german companies should give people in germany work . 
  great . 
  we have 10 % unemployment in half of the former east . 
  but lets go to kosovo to find people who work for us . 
  assholes . 
  how about you make some programs to train people from here . 
  usa , especially their president , definitely wo n't like that we find them less trust-worthy than china , and equally untrustworthy as russia . 
  i 'm so fucking glad they quit the eu, 
  we can talk about it lithuania , belarus , and moldova . 
  there is no debt if there is no fund to be filled . 
  no , i want my money to be spend on something that profits me . 
  really ? 
  been there . 
  ca n't recall it looking like that, 
  fuel might be one of the most insanely taxed things that exist right now . 
  where exactly was that picture taken ? 
  then they should n't have put obnoxious ads all over the internet . 
  their fault . 
  that must be the most uncertain job on earth, 
  i do n't know either ... money makes their brains melt, 
  using the same, 
  ad-block-blocker ? 
  well . 
  not gon na read it then . 
  bottom-right corner : * `` evolution . 
  what duck-sex says about humankind '' *, 
  * `` is he going to be a danger for us all ? 
  '' * seriously ? 
  you ask that *** now *** ? 
  almost 7 *** months *** after he was elected ? 
  over 2 *** years *** after we got to know he 's running for president ? 
  cute \\ ^ \\ _ \\ ^, 
  we have the money , we make the rules, 
  why give somebody eu money if they violate eu rules ?!? 
  from the perspective of the company : suddenly you have 100.000.000 $ more expenses because of this new tax . 
  of course you want to get those 100.000.000 $ back somehow . 
  either you find a new way of producing goods that 's good for the environment , or you stick to the old way while accepting the high tax and getting it from the customers . 
  latter would make this whole thing utterly useless , so we have to prevent them from doing it . 
  obviously you need to add protection that they do n't get that tax from the customers, 
  if you pull that off in germany you 're sued for a whole collection of equality and non-discrimination laws . 
  * edit : there was a rather popular dish called `` moor in a shirt '' . 
  everybody had to rename it to not get into trouble . 
  yes , please . 
  high taxes are the only really effective option we have against companies right now . 
  make them pay 60 % tax and we 'll have the most efficient environmentally-friendly economy in no time . 
  or no economy at all . 
  surprise , that started the day you voted leave . 
  * publicly displaying a picture that can clearly identify somebody without somebody 's clear approval is a severe violation of his/her personal rights . 
  * even after 2 or 3 times people will already have gotten used to it and not care anymore anyway , making this whole thing utterly useless . 
  * it 's a really , really dick move to scare people like that and publicly shame them . 
  trump is a huge ~ ~ failure ~ ~ mistake ... 
  the weapon does not matter in a genocide . 
  it does n't matter if what you do it, 
  macron and merkel look like he 's a small boy asking his auntie for a $ so he can buy a cone of ice cream, 
  we did , but without nukes . 
  i hereby inquire for an honorary political asylum for / u/telescopefeed . 
  luxemburg , what are you doing ? 
  not terribly much , tbh . 
  it 's just some details . 
  people are a lot , lot more conservative in austria though, 
  german here , used to live in austria, 
  because if i do n't get it , i 'll change to another company , and they go bankrupt . 
  please send me a link where i can donate to netflix 's eu-movie budget,
