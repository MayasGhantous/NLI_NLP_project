   an american soldier supervises the loading of a ukrainian t-64 tank onto a british heavy equipment transporter at grafenwoehr , germany , tuesday , may 23 . 
  much global, 
  i 'd love to get away from hollywood once in a while !, 
   now one bird , an american sea eagle , will be on standby in brussels in case drones are flown in unauthorised airspace , anp said . 
  coincidence it 's an american sea eagle ? 
  austrians eat a lot healthier in my experience . 
  outside of the big cities i 've rarely encountered people eating fast food on a regular basis . 
  at least i 've met way fewer people who quickly go to mcdonald 's / burger king/subway/kfc to eat . 
  what happened behind the iron curtain to have diabetes skyrocket ? 
  same question goes to you spain , portugal , greece and italy . 
  stop copy-pasting me / u/marsh _ 6, 
  knowing that most of them earn between 4 and 6 $ here , while most natives need 9 to 11 $ to survive, 
  experience, 
  should i copy-paste a german dictionary ? 
  how am i supposed to get a better qualification if i ca n't earn the money to afford it, 
  no , i 'm much better than them . 
  it 's just that 2 of them still cost the employer less than i do . 
  we ca n't send everybody to uni . 
  we already have way too many academics . 
  many people with uni graduation already do n't get a job anymore , because you do n't need that many people with degrees !, 
  yes , yes we should . 
  a third of my family here is unemployed but there 's dozens of romanians , croats , serbs , and others that work twice as much for a fourth of the money, 
  you need about 9 $ an hour here to barely survive . 
  now imagine there 's tons of people who do it for less than 6 $ . 
  no matter how good you are , the employer simply wo n't take you anymore . 
  i 'll take it . 
  fine by me . 
  as long as they are n't allowed to work . 
  people here already suffer enough from balkan people coming here and voluntarily working for half the minimum wage . 
  we do n't need ukrainians who do it for a third . 
  that is true just as much indeed, 
  because then you 're left with a huge amount of countries , because every time a small inequality appears , the country will split in a better and worse part . 
  which will lead to an amplification of the problems , aka the poor ones get poorer and the rich ones get richer . 
  you just ca n't say * `` fuck those guys , we 'll make our own country '' * when you 're not happy with it . 
  pretty radical if you ask me . 
  was n't that bad when i was there a few months ago . 
  this has been spammed like 5 times so far . 
  most of eastern europe is mostly atheist due to communism . 
  germany is pretty atheist as well to large parts . 
  same is true for denmark and sweden . 
  i 'd look in rural austria , italy , ireland or spain . 
  --  18 to 21 and virgin average age of first sex is between 14 and 17 in europe . 
  good luck !, 
  and addis ababa is considered a safe spot in africa . 
  would that make me go to freaking east africa ? 
  war 150km in the east and a fucking nuclear wasteland 70km in the north . 
  *** just fucking no !, 
  kiev ? 
  who in a sane mind would go to ukraine for holidays ? 
  portugal , why so turk ? 
  that was a referendum on gay rights . 
  we do n't do that here . 
  if we did that , we 'd get 60 % pro-gay as well . 
  it 's just that such a thing never happens here . 
  we only get to vote for parties , which do n't care about gay people terribly much apparently . 
  i 'm in favor of giving all humans equal rights , and i vote accordingly . 
  it 's just that the average citizen is already equal and does n't vote in somebody else 's interest, 
  because ~ ~ nationalism ~ ~ patriotism is considered okay in the us but only for the us, 
  looks like i 'll throw all my electrical devices out and tear the copper out of the walls \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  we have them too , but they 're called * `` closed psychiatries '' * now instead . 
  * who makes the most decisions in the eu ? 
  * do those recognize them ? 
  there you have your answer why it 's not a thing . 
  you can thank merkel for that . 
  over 60 % of germans are in favor of gay marriage according to polls . 
  the party that they vote for do n't . 
  the eu human rights convention explicitly bans discrimination already . 
  it 's just that nobody cares to enforce that , not even liberal countries like germany , france , denmark , or sweden do . 
  plenty, 
  and what are we gon na do against it ? 
  exactly !, 
  we lock them away in high-security ~ ~ psychiatries ~ ~ prisons without trial and force them to take chemicals they do n't want and which do n't even work properly !, 
  well done !, 
  great job !, 
  they could * easily * delete it from their index . 
  of course it is n't gone , but 99 out of 100 people wo n't be able to find it anymore . 
  facebook is the advertiser you fools, 
   which would effectively ban online streaming services from hosting works under free licenses is n't that literally against the very definition of * `` free '' * ? 
   google has since received over 720,000 removal requests and accepted about 43 percent of them , according to its transparency report . 
  * `` removal '' * means that the average pleb just ca n't find them anymore , but they still have it saved 20 times somewhere else . 
  right ? 
  also , i 'm * definitely * not going to send a copy of my passport to google . 
  no way . 
   major conflicts of original eu members i 'm pretty sure ukraine and yugoslavia are part of that . 
  learn to read ffs . 
  old , but not really popular anymore xd they 're in a down-ward spiral atm, 
  hell no !, 
  please no more war . 
  we 've had *** much more *** than enough of that in the past 4 millennia . 
  i just feel like nato absolutely would n't take it easily . 
  after all , if it really was ordered by the north korean government , it falls under the category of technological warfare . 
  and that one was a fucking big thing they pulled off . 
  it 's not * `` oh , we hacked sony just for fun '' * anymore . 
  that 's an actual * `` yea , we tried to kill your entire it infrastructure off , ^ please ^ do n't ^ kill ^ us ... '' *, 
  if north korea really did this , there wo n't be much of a korea left once we 're done . 
  i do not see any kind of statistical data on there . 
  neither on telegraph nor yougov . 
  makes me suspicious . 
  i ca n't say that stuff is legit without given some back-ground data, 
  i 'd be very grateful if not literally 99 out of 100 songs were vanilla pop love songs,
