   israel imri coincidence that it 's just one letter away from * `` inri '' * ? 
   united kingdom [ ... ] `` never give up on you '' do they want to send a message ? 
   bulgaria [ ... ] `` beautiful mess '' stereotypes ? 
   france [ ... ] `` requiem '' is n't that some church thing to do with death ? 
  i swear , they 'll have my vote if it 's death metal . 
   the revamped leopards will enter service between 2019 and 2013 . 
  not only will we have 100 new tanks , we 'll also invent time travel !, 
  looking 25 years back , that map is utterly incorrect everywhere between austria and greece, 
  admittedly , he 's already there for 15 years . 
  many politicians only join in in their 50s and fail in their 60s, 
  the last 4 heads of this party never stood longer than 3 years . 
  he 's only ruining his career by taking that job . 
  12 seems a bit too young for that , if you ask me . 
  i 'd go for 14 to 16 , depending on how mature he/she is, 
  do n't forget when they shot down a russian aircraft over syria without any warning for violating their airspace for 20 seconds, 
  admittedly , you 've got to be an asshole to play silly games in a place where people are in a deep connection with themselves and god . 
  sending him to jail is a bit rough , i 'd have him do social work somewhere instead . 
  the rate is loving the one true greatest leader of them all < 3 ~ ~ * no food included * ~ ~, 
  all eu countries are also in nato , except austria because their independence treaty of 1955 forces them to military neutrality . 
  apart from the eu states , there 's only the us , canada , iceland , norway , turkey , and maybe 2 or 3 others in nato . 
  in all honesty , that 's already pretty close to what an eu army would look like . 
  we would n't let the us in because an eu army would want to be independent from them , but as long as we 're in nato they have a say in all our military actions anyway . 
  turkey would certainly not get in , but that 's not an issue . 
  so , the question is if we really need an eu army in the first place . 
  we just need a tiny bit more independent decision making , but then we 're already at what we 'd have with an eu army . 
  ca n't blame them . 
  barcelona has a much nicer weather than any other european city in question . 
  it also has a beach , chill people , and is n't as screwed as spain . 
  hell , if i had the choice i 'd relocate to barcelona right away xd, 
   let 's say the eu army needs 2 % of gdp given to it ... germany has money to spare and can afford those 2 % nato wants 2 % and we barely manage 1.2 % right now xd we ca n't afford it either because we have such extensive health care and education . 
  we already have one of the highest taxes on earth and ca n't afford shit right now . 
  it 's in the part of berlin that used to be in the east . 
  having diplomatic relations with a buddy of the ussr was considered okay if you 're a buddy of the ussr yourself . 
  but it would be a pretty dick-ish move of the modern-german gov to kick them out . 
  the love of our only true leader is enough warmth to heat our souls < 3, 
  * true korea, 
  germany does n't have 1 cctv per 17 people . 
  neither will you see 5 cctvs on every corner in berlin/hamburg/munich / cologne . 
  they 're not unsuccessful indeed , but that 's probably not because of being conservative . 
  in fact , most larger cities in germany and austria are pretty liberal . 
  the reason for their wealth is that they have high-tech industry * ( which eastern europe has n't , for example ) * and tourism * ( the dutch love making holiday in austria ) * . 
  it 's basically just a term that different parts of europe go full-eu at different speeds . 
  some already joined the $ and schengen , some have n't , some want to have n't , some do n't want to but have , and so on . 
  poland 's recent politics seems to bitch around because of eu 's liberal stances and go the opposite direction . 
  anti-abortion , anti-women-rights , anti-immigration , anti-lgbt , anti-minorities in general , anti-non-christian , all major media state-controlled , etc. 
  it 's a wonder they have n't been kicked out of eu yet . 
  #changebritainforpoland #article 50forpolandnow  it 's understandable in a way , the country has done well for itself for a while now indeed . 
  not having a war with another nation for almost 500 years while being located literally in the middle of 4 very active war-mongering countries is something remarkable . 
  it 's a trait of that area , though . 
  if you look at the neighboring areas , they 're all conservative . 
  rural baw\u00fc and bavaria in germany , vorarlberg and tyrol in austria , etc. 
  who with a sane mind would voluntarily sleep in a shady hostel in what is diplomatically north korea . 
  poland , hungary , and czechia are more conservative, 
  it 's switzerland , but they 're not that different from germany in that regard . 
  it 's also about trans people , but lgb and t are also pretty close together . 
  [ here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexualit%c3%a4t_in_deutschland ) 's the wikipedia article to it . 
  contains more than enough information about it . 
  * `` until 2000 homosexual people were not allowed to become officers . 
  * `` even after decriminalization the collection of data of homosexual people was continued on pink lists by the police '' *  am 10 . 
  * `` on the 10th of april 1957 the federal supreme court ruled that same-sexual activity violates the moral law . 
  ( because of this law ) * `` over 50.000 men were found guilty and 100.000 investigations were started '' * latter was \u00a7 175 penal code * ( stgb ) * , btw . 
  was originally made by the nazis . 
  was n't outlawed until the late 1950s . 
  even after that they did n't really stop to hunt people down for . 
  more like 4 bottles of quality beer . 
  it 's no secret that the uk is probably the country in the western world that 's the most likely to go full big brother . 
  not even the us go so insane on surveillance than the brits . 
  good that they do n't have a say in eu laws anymore now, 
  0.5 % less income tax would turn out to be less than 10 $ per month for me atm xd, 
  still , they ... * have much higher rates of unemployment * are more likely to be homeless * are generally poorer than the average person * can not marry * suffer from more illnesses than average * are attacked simply for who they are * are discriminated by the general population * could be imprisoned for having sex until the 1990s * had documents for being gay by the gov just a few decades ago, 
   a subtle hint from its host government , the brussels region , that some eu countries are not doing enough to protect their lgbt populations . 
  not even the best countries do enough , if you ask me . 
  even in countries like the netherlands , belgium , or germany . 
  there 's still plenty of discrimination for those people here . 
  of course they 're not killed or attacked on a large scale or so , but life is still shit for many of them . 
  okay , it 's much , but it still boils down to paying about 0,5 % less taxes, 
  [ this might actually be the very first time i managed to be first ] ( https://drive.google.com/open?id=0b-h1ce_nbjqctezbwhe5bej5yta ) . 
  he said he feels like a placeholder , who people only care about if they need something from him . 
  something along those lines at least , afaik . 
  on top of that his own party attacked him quite a bit throughout the last couple of months . 
  i figure he quit because of that, 
  my dad almost freaked out , because * `` you ca n't just screw everything up and piss off when you 're sick of it '' * xd, 
  california is more or less a desert , and much better off than more fertile areas in the mid-west . 
   he saw scope to lower taxes by 0.5 percent of germany 's gross domestic product very generous !, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  and switzerland can into balkan \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  ny is on 43 \u00b0 n , which is about as much north as florence , nice , toulouse , and sarajevo . 
  it 's almost 100 % up to the country 's history . 
  most southern countries are in such a horrible condition , because they 've been colonies for several centuries , and then almost completely abandoned to corruption . 
  there 's only a few exceptions where this was n't entirely the case . 
  climate does n't influence it much either . 
  that 's merely a coincidence . 
  how do you explain that sweden * ( where -30 \u00b0 c are n't rare ) * is about as developed as catalonia * ( where +40 \u00b0 c are n't rare ) * . 
  what are we supposed to do ? 
  wait until their sultan beheads them or throws them into jail for 30 years ? 
  you do know that many maps distort quite a lot ? 
  you have to look at the numbers , not just draw a vaguely horizontal line ... 
  how south something is does n't explain how developed it is ... also , southern california * ( san diego 32 \u00b0 n ) * is as south as libya , iran , afghanistan , etc. . . just saying . 
  germany, 
  it 's not even aired here,
