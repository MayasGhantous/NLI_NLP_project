  there 's a difference between only joining eec and quitting eu without wanting to lose benefits, 
  greenland never quit the eu, 
   unless you 're suggesting countries not in the eu we are n't talking about that ? 
  i was only talking about the uk and post-brexit-eu ? 
   britain has arguably been a great ally in terms of military and security and so would n't the eu wish to maintain good relations with britain post brexit ? 
  germany , spain , italy , and france do n't have weak armies either . 
  latter being a nuclear power as well . 
  with exception to austria , everybody 's also a part of nato and hence has the support of the us , canada , turkey , norway , and a few others . 
  no , the uk is n't really that important in a military sense . 
   why is the eu so outwardly hostile here ? 
  you ca n't leave a trade union and still want to trade with that union . 
  it simply does n't work like that . 
  it 's like breaking up with your girlfriend/boyfriend but insisting on having sex after you moved out . 
   which is pretty pathetic either way it 's like they 're afraid that the 1,2 million evil refugees will swim across the atlantic and ruin the glorious 340 million people usa, 
   ex-nazi teach that guy with the china flair of mao zedong and his great leap forward . 
  he can use ms paint !, 
  i 'm so proud of you / u/serventofgaben ! you even made a typo in your username, 
  they are , but they also suffer from high unemployment rates and a weak middle class . 
  exactly the group le pen addressed . 
  the greens are a joke . 
  there 's no use for a green party that has n't got much interest in environmental issues , promotes war , does n't even care about pedophiles in their party being publicly pedophile , does n't even manage to lead their own party into a certain direction , etc. 
   let 's say more than 1,000 inhabitants everything below 25k is a shithole, 
  90km from genoa, 
  suck it le pen * ahem . 
  merkel for chancellor . 
  ^ again . 
  ^ the ^ 4 ^ th ^ time . 
  ^ how ^ is ^ this ^ even ^ legal . 
  you ca n't imagine how glad i am to see fdp has somewhat recovered from that one 2013 election i do n't want to talk about xd, 
  maybe via satellite, 
   what 's the catch ? 
  you have to live in a remote , almost extinct village in italy close to the border to france ? 
  \\* * blushes * \\* thanks :3, 
  we like ourselves , but we do n't run around screaming * '' ~ ~ usa !, 
  usa !, 
  usa ~ ~ '' * like some people on this planet do, 
  french has more influence than german globally . 
  a part of canada , huge parts of west africa , parts of south-east asia , some of the pacific . 
  german is only important within europe and maybe a couple of villages in namibia and cameroon . 
   patriotic or nationalistic doesnt equal far right or any sort of extremism you would n't hear an anarchist say that . 
  it 's a sign of authoritarianism . 
  mostly right , but sometimes left . 
  most patriots and nationalists are authoritarian right . 
  a convinced nationalist will barely not be that . 
  actually , ** all ** languages in the eu are working languages of the eu . 
  everything 's translated anyway, 
  we could argue if it 's childish to leave a union as soon as you feel like it, 
  maybe , but it 's a statement, 
  i have no clue what went on at the dinner with may , but it seems she managed to piss him off quite a bit . 
  eu and russia ? 
  merkel diplomatically bitch-slapped putin just a few days ago . 
  there 's no way the eu and russia cooperate . 
  germany is n't really that patriotic , except for the army and football matches . 
  it 's about the only place where you can shout patriot * ( or almost nationalist ) * ideals around without getting some weird looks for it . 
  the army is known to be a safehaven for ( far ) right wing people . 
  it absolutely does n't surprise me, 
  \\ ^ exactly this  that does not involve major delay by now i already expect to be 30 minutes late when planning the trip . 
   pricing model 280 $ for a distance that costs me 40 $ with flixbus, 
  why is france so much more divided ? 
  worst-case : expel turkish diplomats and close the embassy and consulates, 
  they ca n't check for * what * you vote , but they can stop people from voting for that thing as a whole before it even takes place . 
  how many have it been within the last 100 years ? 
  about 200 to 250 million ? 
  you should go to jail for even mentioning communism/socialism is n't all bad, 
  this . 
  exactly this is why we ca n't have nice things . 
  when do people *** finally *** get that communism/socialism does n't work . 
  but i guess your brain needs to be pretty fried in the first place that you believe in that ... 
  it 's simple . 
  death penalty violates the german constitution * ( and the un and eu human rights ) * . 
  hence germany can stop them from holding a referendum to allow it . 
  poor , poor sultan, 
  not if it 's for the yellow has something to say, 
  same here in germany, 
  fdp * ( federal , not sure about state-level ) * said they prefer having a say in the opposition instead of shutting up for the sake of being in the government . 
  hence spd + cdu . 
  all other possibilities do n't get the 50 %, 
   `` france will be led by a woman , either me or mrs merkel , '' germany approves, 
  are you sure ? 
  may pissed the eu off quite a bit, 
  a piece of paper , aka a contract, 
  * looks at credit in right hand * sure , if you want some of that ? 
  * looks at greece menacingly *, 
  because you do n't want a trade war with all of europe xd, 
  hahaha . 
  their fault . 
  they 'll regret it badly . 
  ~ ~ have fun paying those 100000000000 $ ~ ~, 
  even more immigration ? 
  how many have there been during the last 2 years ? 
  over 2 million all in all ? 
  do n't pull all of europe into this . 
  it 's been the brits and french who did that !, 
  i 'm all on her side there . 
  there 's instructors almost raping their students and it 's one of the biggest safe-havens for nazis . 
  clear that army out, 
  there 's so much wrong with russia , i have no clue where to start ... 
  makes no sense . 
  those fires are made in much larger areas than exclusively with violet dots . 
  the blue-ish ones ca n't be mountains , because there are no mountains in the blue part of austria .
