  in fact , the part that 's colored blue is the most flat plane of their whole country . 
  a small hint would be great i have no clue what color is what, 
  nature always wins . 
  i 'm a bit torn on the issue . 
  sure , those people need to get paid . 
  but if they 're too obnoxious with it , they 'll just make me install an adblocker . 
  it 's like having to pay 25 $ to read a single issue of newspaper, 
  there 's adblockers that block adblockblockers . 
  look at ublock origin , if you 're on firefox, 
   it is in german . 
  there is no english translation . 
  nor is there a complete online version of the article . 
  forbes does n't manage to get hold of a complete article from one of the biggest german newspapers and get somebody translate it ? 
   may then insisted to juncker et al that uk owes eu no money because there is nothing to that effect in the treaties . 
  her guests then informed her that the eu is not a golf club . 
  \\* sigh \\*  davis then objected that eu could not force a post-brexit , post-ecj uk to pay the bill . 
  ok , said juncker , then no trade deal . 
  obviously they do n't care . 
  according to them , britain will get literally all the trade that previously has been handled by other eu nations . 
  and obviously america and china will absolutely love them for leaving and will only trade with them afterwards !, 
  of course, 
  turkey is partly in europe , you can add sultan erdogan to that pic, 
  same in southern germany and large parts of austria, 
  rt is a russian tv channel , owned by putin himself . 
  infamous for anti-western propaganda . 
  t34 can crush everything, 
  conchita a 2 ^ nd time ? 
  this year they send [ the whitest person that they could find ] ( https://youtu.be/cgtmiveyf1u?t=10 ) . 
  hahaha xd omg xd made my day !, 
  putin will crush you . 
  apparently not :p, 
  that 's what i call passion for a job . 
  albania is as much of a future to europe as ukraine , belarus or turkey, 
  i 'm glad i forget that , thanks for reminding me, 
  see , and others bashed me for how they are actually more for freedom than other parties ... 
  more democratic than belarus , but not really democratic either, 
  fp\u00d6 is the opposite of liberal . 
  it 's quite literally the direct successor of the nsdap ... well , actually vdu , but they 're the same, 
  far-right and freedom are usually antagonists, 
   far-right freedom party \\* sigh \\*, 
  good . 
  there 's no place for dictators in europe * ( yes , including belarus ) * . 
  true , our health care and worker 's protection is * tremendously * better than the american one , but the rest just sucks . 
  i wan na see the reason why germany has equally much economic freedom as the us . 
  neither of them are good, 
  the trump ~ ~ dynasty ~ ~ family has very , very low approval here . 
  it 's no wonder that happens . 
  when they were elected into office , only a 4 ^ th or even only a 5 ^ th of germans thought it 's good to continue the alliance with the us . 
  for comparison , almost a 10 ^ th thinks it 'd be good to ally with russia . 
  there 's literally half as many people who prefer putin over trump . 
  when they ran a poll , who would 've been elected with the us election had been held here , trump got a stunning 5 %, 
  we had 25 \u00b0 c and sun 2 weeks before eastern , and on eastern we had -5 \u00b0 c and roughly 15 cm of snow . 
  now we 're at 10 \u00b0 c and permanent clouds . 
  there 's a reason it 's called * `` april weather '' *, 
  nice weather . 
  would love to go there again for a week or two, 
  the left-wing 's programs are very budget heavy in general , so they need more taxes than the right-wing . 
  on top of that , many left parties go straight to communism , which does n't really appeal to people, 
   the czech republic [ ... ] also known as czechia i guess they 're synonymous . 
  * [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_republic ) * . 
  i like how france as a whole still stays the same , but paris makes a huge bulge into the middle, 
  that 's actually pretty weak , given that the eu28 have a population of 510 million , compared to 318 million of the us . 
  that 's 59 % in the eu and 72 % in the us . 
  their promises might even help people in the end , when it 's actually done . 
  the way of getting there is more than questionable , though , if it 's doable at all, 
  i wo n't pull my personal opinion of those people and that party into this discussion , but it 's just a fact that they address the casual citizen 's problems and give them a possible ( ? ), 
  solution to it . 
  many of those right-populist groups are directly addressing the unhappy , rather poor , working class . 
  it 's no wonder that areas with those kind of people are more likely to vote for them than some rich suburb of paris . 
  better hope they start campaigning soon, 
  exaclty , and do n't forget about linke . 
  when afd rose to power for the first time , the linke were those whose graphs went down vertically . 
  on the other side , not wanting merkel a ** 4 ^ th ** time was one of the main reasons people ran to afd, 
  if cdu really does gain voters , there 's a good chance they 'll get them from spd and afd on top of that ... 
  that 'll be very hard to pull off for spd . 
  let 's assume everybody stays about the same until the election . 
  that 'll be a bit more than 30 % for spd . 
  then there 's the greens with a bit more than 5 % . 
  there 's linke with a bit less than 10 % . 
  there 's fdp with barely over 5 % . 
  one of those 4 needs to gain another 5 to 10 % from another party * ( cdu/csu , afd ) * , or their only chance is a minority government . 
  best case we 'll have some spd/green/linke or spd/green/fdp that barely got the 50 % . 
  even if that 's the case , there 's sometimes vast differences between those parties . 
  you could never get communists and economic-liberals into a coalition ~ ~ * ( nvm , they 'll just betray their ideals for the sake of not being opposition for once ) * ~ ~ . 
  it 'll most likely be spd in a coalition with cdu/csu, 
  it 'll be hard , even for them , to go back to 20 % within the next 3 months . 
  it took them over a year to get there , when their promises were exactly what the people wanted . 
  now , they are completely screwed up with their internal fight for power . 
  while all the other parties are already begging for voters big style , they do n't even know a program to go with . 
  not to mention that a lot of them only voted for them in protest , and now went back to their original parties such as spd now that those have changed a bit . 
  and a devastating failure compared to 3 months ago, 
  they crashed down by far over 10 % in polls since the beginning of the year . 
  there 's no way they can compete with cdu/csu and spd * ( both around 34 % ) * with their 9 % now . 
  they joined the ranks of greens , fdp , and linke , where they exist but are of no importance whatsoever . 
  hahaha . 
  come at us :p, 
  that 's how war works , in a nutshell . 
  i 'm sorry to say , but it belongs to us now xd, 
  schleswig-holstein is german . 
  germany is n't exactly the first thing that comes to your mind when you say scandinavia xd,
