yep . 
  if it 's cold , people just create more heat using co2-producing means , so it 's not that cold the next time . 
  who cares about people that live near coastlines , right ? 
  i mean , they 'll still be * near * the coastlines afterwards . 
  thing is , i guess that the most that will happen is that russia keeps this up until they have ( re ) assimilated a few territories , then it 's over . 
  except that the act itself stays with us and changes history for the worse . 
  i wonder if there is a way to prevent future such actions at all . 
  the ultimate problem - the nuclear option - would never be chosen . 
  this is why i am convinced that russia will stop eventually , unlike germany back then . 
  they * know * that no one can stop them if they are willing to put up with some painful sanctions , and will stop in time by themselves . 
   in a way it is a very clever way of invading . 
  instead of stomping the door in they just slither around and through and over but they are not quite doing a hard invasion you can point at but one day they 'll be everywhere and it 'll be too late to stop them . 
  sounds like a cliche-redneck describing unemployment . 
  cameron 's little muslim-zoo , huh . 
  great britain lost its greatness . 
  probably related to dc 's fervent swallowing of muslim-feces . 
  [ i just realized that the way i wrote here sounds like retard-english . 
  i do n't normally write like that . ], 
  got my first load in school , but with increasingly terrible grades . 
  then the webternet came . 
  and dvd movies ( several language soundtracks to choose from , most movies originally being in english , subtitles in that language ( in case i could n't acoustically decipher properly ) and my own ( german ) ) . 
  and software . 
  best booster was watching movies in english . 
  i would watch movies several times , hence a good learning effect . 
  the goal was to enjoy the movie , hence definitely to understand what was said . 
  if you * want * to do something , you 'll be better at it than if you * have to do * something . 
  you can skip the rest , i felt like rambling . 
  reasons to learn english for me : * the world 's gon na speak it eventually , anyway . 
  works in most places today , at least . 
  * most movies i 'm interested in are originally english , and i have learned how * terribly immersion-breaking * listening to translated movis is or , conversely , how * impacting * it is to finally hear the guys talk in their own properly acted and `` biologically fitting '' voices is . 
  * software : the english web is so much larger than the german web , so if i need help with anything , i search in english . 
  but searching for english words based on german software - bad idea . 
  so , switched software entirely to english , too . 
  another reason : translations are often impure if not terrible ( old microsoft software would even have more text than fit the controls that were to show the text ) . 
  audio-translated games suck like movies , only more . 
  * music is also a weak push to wanting to know english . 
  * using english even for personal stuff is useful because it has less characters , german also has \u00c4\u00d6\u00dc\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc\u00df * there are some words that i think just do n't exist in the other language . 
  german -  english as well as the other way round . 
  knowing more languages allows me to express more meanings . 
  i feel that `` the mind '' has no proper equivalent in german . 
  it 's sadly funny that russian police have `` omoh '' on their backs - `` homo '' spelled backwards . 
  assuming that the money will really return to sender , which i believe it will not : you ca n't just throw money at people , you have to make sure that they are at least kinda quasi in a position to get out of the problem-zone , otherwise you 're just feeding them for some time , then the problem re-appears . 
  and yes , it 's a thankless task , because suddenly everybody is proud to show their education . 
  ( `` germany ? 
  ... hitler , right ? '' ), 
  that * happened . 
  ze germs are eferyvere zees des . 
  ftfy . 
  both names are valid . 
  just like there 's `` christoph '' and `` christof '' . 
  just to clarify : i watch news every morning and hop from channel to channel depending on availability , so it 's tagesschau , sat1 nachrichten , n-tv , and n24 . 
  i 'm not at all focused on n24 . 
  maybe it 's all a ploy by the industry . 
  they are counting on gamers buying shooters out of spite . 
  * yesterday * morning , the n24 news station had a report about two guys regularly visiting a demented ( or somesuch ) senior citizen and bullying ( emotionally torturing and such ) him . 
  afterwards , they had some also senior-citizen-ish psychologist or expert or whatever he was tell us the reasons . 
  from memory : `` one reason is probably violence done to them as children . 
  another reason is the playing of violent video games . '', 
  i thought they were fucking shitting me . 
  hallo ? 
  : `` you , rope his hands . '' ), 
  yeah , about those gazillion tanks and the money their maintenance costs ... 
  and no plans for a situation like the one we 're in . 
  a country ca n't just be removed from the euro currency , it has to do that itself . 
  source : heard it several times over the last months on the news . 
  also , everybody is like `` we ca n't let them crash out , other countries could follow this example ! '', 
  while completely ignoring that `` we ca n't let too-big-to-fail become an example for other countries ! '', 
  is far more important . 
  well , billions ( e.g. 
  90 from germany ) have been given to greece in the last few years . 
  the earlier greece wisens and mans up , the less the country will further deteriorate , the earlier the payback can begin . 
  our leaders have to answer to us for the money they gave away , at least i would hope so . 
  it 's more than 1000 $ per head !, 
  http://media.skynews.com/media/images/generated/2015/6/19/399947/default/v1/greece-pensions-gh-graph-1-762x428.jpg ( article : http://news.sky.com/story/1504923/greek-pensions-q-and-a-too-generous ) http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/03/retirement-at-45-and-8-other-simple-reasons-greece-is-imploding-right-now/ http://www.cnbc.com/id/102770035 and do n't get me started on the greek 's willingness to pay their taxes , even before the crisis , which is combined with the corruption of its prior governments why greece fell down in the first place . 
  i thought greece was the horse , and the warriors that came out at night were the too-big-to-fail arguments . 
  well , the whole point of all things the greek government has done in negotiations seems to be to draw the inevitable out , so it depends on when the eu will wisen up and say stop . 
  this change of finance-minister is yet another move in the same scheme . 
  `` oh , we have reason to talk to them again now ! '', 
  right . 
  they are like north korea , screaming at the world , except they actually have the balls to attack people . 
  still , they are mostly just screaming trolls . 
  xd it 's funny how you have decided to focus on the topic of racism , meaning that by now , you are * wishing * that i am a racist . 
  you are also not understanding of culture or society , or you would realize that yes , a certain group of people ( e.g. 
  a nation ) can , on average at least , share a characteristic that makes a judgment ( btw. , it 's judgment time . ), 
  like i properly derived it and then ultimately presented it here proper . 
  now , even if you could rape language enough to water down the true meaning of racism to fit your agenda , meaning that you are helping racists world-wide , because you 're trying to weaken the actual meaning of the word : if your weird definition of racism would apply to me , then i would be a racist . 
  so fucking what . 
  why is this not a problem ? 
  because it would be a different definition , you twat . 
  and let me finish this tiresome conversation with you mortal worm off with a final warning : without me , you will die . 
  i am the only one who can give you immortality . 
  now , if you insist that i shall not or am not the one to do that , then i will to the most gruesome thing to you : i will agree . 
  now keep dancing , i 'm turning off replies . 
  wow , you are even showing clear signs of being an idiot . 
  racism ? 
  look up the meaning of race , you obnoxious greek bastard troll . 
  also , you have to fucking apologize to me , your goddamn creator . 
  i am not kidding here . 
  you are in for a world of hurt if you do n't clean up your act . 
  you should also apologize to the german people , of which i am a prime example .
