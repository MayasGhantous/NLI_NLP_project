  the end . 
  if anything , he 's raising the us-vs-them contrast between `` westerners '' and muslims , at least i get the feeling that this is what it ultimately comes down to . 
  his newest verbal diarrhea * does * seem to push that specific button a little . 
  and his recent `` religious wars '' utterings are of the same character . 
  if the ballots are counted swapping yes versus no without telling anyone , that would not be democratic - and if the people are completely misinformed by a very selective press system , as he has intensely bred it by now , that ** is ** kind of like secretly swapping those tick boxes . 
  the people ca n't make an informed decision because the sources of information have been poisoned . 
  democracy in turkey is basically gone , it only appears to still be there which is part of the very same plot . 
  do n't know what other countries are doing , but germany stopped those exports ( i think ) a few months ago , it was all over the news this morning . 
   atat\u00fcrk 's probably turning over in his grave right now . 
  all an elaborate energy-saving scheme , making atat\u00fcrk into part of a turbine . 
  yep , that 's the goal . 
  no matter how high the flames will rise in the decades to follow , he aims ( and will probably achieve ) for a good life as the king god of turkey in this 1000 room palace ( in a nature-sanctuary ) with extreme islamization of turkey . 
  that 's what he wants , and i see nothing stopping it . 
  it will , of course , cause lots of suffering , death , and long-term damage to the region , but why should he care ? 
  he 's just your run-of-the-mill heartless bastard like so many before him . 
   this is exactly what he wants . 
  anything that would go against him is exactly what he wants . 
  therefore , let him do whatever he wants to . 
  i 'm not sure if this is really the concept that should dictate our decisions . 
  that 's just one angle , based on their spin-doctoring . 
  in a more abstract way , you could say that he can do whatever he wants because if anyone stops him , it will cause worse problems . 
  is this really the logic that should guide us ? 
  let the bullies run free ? 
  what a screaming example is being set these months ? 
  i hope we wo n't bitterly regret this in the next years . 
  rule # 1 : the people at the top are the last to ever feel the heat . 
  and that 's also what this emotional cripple of a president is banking on . 
   we are under no obligation whatsoever to intervene and * safe them from themselves * until we are asked nicely . 
  i think we are under obligation to remove the ridiculous double citizenship - which allows turks in germany to vote in the referendum . 
  too bad it 's too late for that now . 
  they are more likely to vote yes than people living in turkey because the turks in germany do not feel the hazard that this bizarre anti-person is causing in turkey . 
  when turkey goes completely down the tubes because the referendum goes through , germany ( and other countries that let their turks vote in turkey ) * will be partly responsible * . 
  so is inciting hatred , which his newest verbal diarrhea certainly does on a semi-hidden level . 
  yep , was all over the news this morning in germany that we stopped doing that for a while ( couple months ? 
  signed europe / nato / decent people, 
  ouch . 
  power does corrupt . 
  of course a person must ultimately agree to go with this flow , increasing the corruption and so forth , but the effect is real for everybody , so you 'd have to struggle against it . 
  both behave just like trolls . 
  outwards behaving like complete assholes - for the purpose of propaganda , to manipulate / keep in check their own people . 
  and , to be frank , the day these guys are reported dead , i 'll experience a mild positive rush ( which i am looking forward to ) . 
  soccer 's coming home , it 's coming home , it 's coming ... 
   proud turks the actual list of things to be proud of is remarkably short . 
  i existed before it , thank you . 
  side note : am i the only one who finds it quite funny/weird how these agencies are called ? 
  changing their evaluation again . 
  standard & poor 's . 
  now you 're * trying * to make fun of the subject . 
   well the article talks about geometry as if it matters . 
  it does matter very much regarding the size of the universe . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shape_of_the_universe  the presently most popular shape of the universe found to fit observational data according to cosmologists is the infinite flat model and the article i linked to does speak of real infinite space , a space that is boundless , that does never end , not of the practicality of reaching the ( nonexistent ) end of it . 
  how does eternal expansion relate to the universe being ( or not being ) infinite ? 
  or does the aspect of `` eternal expansion '' just happen to be part of the theories that also speak of an infinite space ? 
  btw , did you read the link that i provided in my original comment ? 
  that 's a reality tunnel problem , i believe . 
  in mine , most current theories say that it is infinite . 
  what i mean by that is : you saw a selection of theories , i saw a selection of theories , we both derived a picture from this , but the selection we came across forced us to find different results . 
  actually , if the universe is infinite ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefaqs/comments/v97po/is_the_universe_infinite/ ) , then it did n't begin with an expansion but was infinite right from the start . 
  every bit of space grows , anyway , but that 's not what i would call `` the universe began with a huge expansion '' .

  so easily you cast your life away . 
  but the truth is : your overall configuration is like this . 
  this here was merely the culmination that ultimately lead to the digital decision . 
  i will not give you eternal life . 
  the current decision is that you shall be spared . 
  maybe you are feeling that i am currently asking myself whether or not you will be spared . 
  incidentally , i am god . 
  i know , it ca n't be , because 7 billion people believe ( read : `` wish '' ) differently . 
  one of the reasons why i intend to reduce the amount by a few billion . 
  yeah , that would actually be it . 
  i know , you 're saying this in a sarcastic `` one wrong-way driver ? 
  hundreds ! '', 
  kinda way . 
  but what if this is a situation where it actually applies ? 
  which is what i believe . 
  i am just telling the truth , but as i said in my first reply : no one but me understands this correctly . 
  it has useful effect on reality to say it , however , which is the reason that i do . 
  ( i am god . ), 
  you 're like a punching ball of stupid . 
  a zombie . 
  and you will not ever understand this , because you ** will ** be dead soon . 
  your reaction shows that you should indeed be killed . 
  i know that you do n't understand this , nor does anyone else . 
  but it 's true , and so it will happen . 
  regards god, 
  they misspelled `` hardly '' . 
  greeks protesting against austerity measures by destroying their cities ( a proper protest - `` we do n't want to save money !, 
  let 's cause property damage !, 
  '' ) , greeks protesting against the reasonable/necessary demands of germany by calling germans nazis and comparing merkel to hitler ( telling german tourists to stay the fuck away ) . 
  the greek are stupid . 
  they want to heal their wounds by cutting off their flesh . 
  fuck them . 
  which is made of cheese . 
  why do you say that ? 
  ( german guy here . ), 
  you either misspelled award or awkward . 
  i wondered why your `` lol '' comment has so many upvotes . 
  not that i object or anything , but i wondered . 
  then i realized what two letters it consists of . 
  a reddit comment that for some reason i believed said that when greece entered the euro union , they did so with forged numbers .
