no of course not . 
  but this picture with this heading definetley did !, 
  well the gdr is part of the picture !, 
  or is it a military parade by western germany ? 
  the german `` democratic '' republic had much more in common with todays north korea , then military parades . 
  try wikipedia !, 
  this picture reminds me of todays north korea : / . 
  two germans taking part in this fun game are [ horst mahler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horst_mahler ) , who went from being founder of the infamous , far-left terrorist organization [ red army faction ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) to defending the far-right [ national democratic party of germany ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democratic_party_of_germany ) party before courts and denying the holocaust and [ j\u00fcrgen els\u00e4sser ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%bcrgen_els%c3%a4sser ) , who went from maoism and leninism to right-wing populism and conspiracy theories . 
  [ euer land tr\u00e4gt edelstein ! `` ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eggln-zrtd0 ), 
  thanks !, 
  i think the question is , who is following the consistent interpretation of the quran , isis , muslim brotherhood , wahabis , the majority of muslims , moderate muslims or ? 
  [ the comparison of the two founders of christianity and islam is really helpful . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrqegp0t76s&amp;list=uuroomhnu4p6mnplacmldeda ), 
  no this is n't the case . 
  posting news articles reporting facts and giving a voice to the voiceless is n't hate . 
  or what do you consider as hate ? 
  thanks for the ad hominem , not !, 
  but thanks for the source . 
  i do n't hate people , i try to love every person , like jesus did . 
  but i do reject some ideas , thoughts , believes . 
  you do n't reject some ideas , thoughts , believes ? 
  the crusades are very complex . 
  there were many worldy leaders taking part in it . 
  the church and some christians sadly did some totally bad things . 
  but i think what they did , can not be justified by the consistent interpretaton of the bible . 
  if jesus is gods son and he said , love your enmies , you ca n't reverse this . 
  jesus teachings are only proven more through bad things christians do ( this is n't a justification for sinning !, 
  as stated in the old testament and repeated by jesus , when he met the devil in the desert , god should n't be tried . ) . 
  everyone is a sinner and needs jesus forgiving grace . 
  the church is n't a museum for saints , but a hospital for broken sinners . 
   same goes for christianity btw . 
  sources please !, 
  it is very important to distinguish two things in this context : 1 . 
  attacking and devaluing humans as a person is always bad . 
  but `` attacking '' and critizing ideas , ideologies , worldviews , believes , thoughts is not bad , but the fundamental human right called freedom of speech !, 
  attacking and devaluing humans as a person is always bad , but `` attacking '' and critizing ideas , ideologies , worldviews , believes , thoughts is not bad , but the fundamental human right called freedom of speech !, 
  well it is wrong , that you ignore the human rights declaration !, 
  freedom of religion is n't a medieval thing . 
  ignoring it leads to medieval things , as can be seen in all over iraq , syria and other majority muslim countries . 
  good that you care about freedom of religion . 
  why do n't you get your hopes up ? 
  no because from what i know the average redditor does not really care about freedom of religion or what is going on in the middle east . 
  do you think we should be calm about islamism , isis and so on ? 
  considering the attitude of the average redditor , it is n't confirmation bias . 
  can you please tell me , what is wrong in posting news articles based on facts ? 
  sir you have any right to downvote or correct the content i submit . 
  i think it is interesting to do [ a comparison between the founders of the two religions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrqegp0t76s&amp;list=uuroomhnu4p6mnplacmldeda ) . 
  islamism or extremism ? 
  thanks for the hint . 
  i also highly can recommend a rational debate between [ an atheist and a christian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo6tprble3u&amp;list=uusjezu3tk45jps0ywrq0s0q ) . 
  the whole [ youtube channel of veritas forum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/veritasforum/videos ) features debates and letures on science and faith . 
  thanks for your answer . 
  i think it is really interesting to do [ a comparison of the founders of christianity and islam , as done in a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrqegp0t76s&amp;list=uuroomhnu4p6mnplacmldeda ) ( there are english subtitles , you can activate them by clicking on the symbol on the right side of the clock ) . 
  do you think it is true , that god does not exist ? 
  okay , but you do think atheism is true ? 
  why you'arent fond of the term atheist ? 
  no i 'm not boming reddit , i sometimes post news about violation of human rights . 
  what is your way ? 
  everyone is religious in some way . 
  no sorry you 're wrong , i devoted my life to jesus christ . 
  if your agenda includes calling people `` to go die '' , i hink it is n't a good agenda !, 
  why is this getting downvoted ? 
  you 're partly right . 
  but what leads you to the conclusion , there is an argument in the first posting of cyridius ? 
  it is an accusation , but not an argument . 
   almost your entire post history is literally pro-israel propaganda or anti-muslim/pro-christian crap . 
  besides that i agree with you that living in peace is a good aim , but it is n't everything as we can see in north korea . 
  so thanks for your chiming in . 
  did you know that opposing a worldview , doens ' t mean to oppose the person holding it ? 
  this is called tolerance . 
  what is your view on islam , christianity and israels politics ? 
  maybe i can get an answer from you , if cyridius does n't want to or havent got an answer . 
  btw . 
  losing an argument , where there are no arguments involved at all , besides `` oh your biased , the sources you post are biased too. , full of shit , crap , bullshit '' is n't kind of a big deal , i think . 
   you ca n't turn it around on me because it makes absolutely no sense to do so . 
  sorry , but this argument is just weak . 
  it is n't an argument . 
  why is your view not bullshit ? 
   probably because all the sources are incredibly biased and you 're trying to massively spread a one sided view ? 
  spreading propaganda is bad and you know it . 
  why are the sources biased , that i post ? 
  and is it not much more propaganda , if one makes accusations based not on arguments but on emotions ? 
  why ca n't i turn your sentence around to you ? 
  again are you promoting an anti-israel , pro-muslim and anti-christian view ? 
  btw . 
  majority does n't equal truth . 
  can you please bring on some arguments besides emotions and ad hominem , why the things that i post are bad ? 
  so then your sentence is promoting an anti-israel , pro-muslim and anti-christian view ? 
  why were n't you expecting it ? 
  you know bethinking ? 
  nah it 's still not random if you know which was [ the main cause for the developement of the western civilization ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nhv3j8inrq ) . 
  thanks for the hint !, 
  we should n't underestimate in dealing with this issue , that there are many [ shia-majority states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shia_islam#list_of_nations_for_which_the_shia_population_may_be_estimated ) in the middle east region , for example lebanon , iran , iraq , azerbaijan , bahrain , but not one christian one . 
  we need to change that asap or else we 're going down in history books as the most politically incorrect and most [ un-intellectual ] ( http://veritas.org/ ) state cooperation ever . 
  if it 's [ true that christ is forever risen from the dead and therefore indeed is the son of god ] ( http://www.bethinking.org/did-jesus-rise-from-the-dead ) , it would n't be so random to put it on a flag of a state , right ? 
  woudl n't it be true equality to grant the most persecuted groups of people the most easiest refuge status ? 
  you may know [ that is according to sharia law forces non-sunni-muslims to pay a toll or to leave or to die , but does n't force this onto sunni-muslims ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/world/middleeast/isis-forces-last-iraqi-christians-to-flee-mosul.html ) . 
  it is totally true , everyone who is persecuted deserves help . 
  but those who are persecuted the most , need the most help . 
  for example in the so called islamic state non-muslims need to pay a toll , if they still want to live there holding onto to their faith/religion and not being deported or killed .
