  major hateful eight spoiler , though . 
  the link is * literally * a link to the state media . 
  as al sissi does in this interview . 
   ones that have been suspected of terror activities . 
  so , you 'd put people into jail forever without proof ? 
  i kinda like how / r/europe does n't even hide how fascist it 's become anymore . 
  mate , you have to be illiterate to `` not get that '' . 
  he very clearly did not call you a racist . 
  he made fun of you for claiming that / r/europe is a left wing circle jerk while it 's overrun with racists , nationalists and other right wingers . 
  he did not call you a racist . 
  it 's nothing like actual german immigrants either . 
  it 's just right wing scare mongering . 
  it 's the same way in our countries - it 's just people saying `` but you 're not even allowed to say that anymore '' . 
  hahaha , fuck , i ca n't read . 
  somehow i read your comment as `` kicking out the german populace of eastern europe , killing roughly a million in the process was * vaguely negative * '' . 
  do n't really know why . 
  i wonder how much ukraine profits from this and whether cultivating the land on their own would be better . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deep_state very much worth reading about . 
  lol , what ? 
  not even we ourselves think that way about germany . 
  zeit or cicero in germany . 
  * is better translated as * we 'll make it * or * we 'll do it * . 
  there 's a fine yet important difference imo . 
   some social workers do n't dare to touch into a turkish family , but they have no problem of a non muslim family if its disfunctional i do n't really understand what you 're trying to say here . 
   the last period put the pirates in charge of the ber airport commission , which turned out to the biggest pile of shit that could ever hit fan for those involved . 
   i 'm quite fond of making fun of the stupid pirates but really respect martin delius ' work in the ber commission . 
  seems like a smart and hard working guy to me . 
  [ no dude . 
  ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=wer+hat+uns+verraten&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1blwb_ende528de529&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1848&amp;bih=990&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewihvswlhprpahvhwiwkhs0ed64q_auibygc ) https://youtu.be/8vfl0qwxugi?t=1m17s, 
   germany deserves it at this point . 
  i 'll laugh at the next cologne or bombing . 
  and you wonder why we do n't want people like you in our parliaments . 
  germany is not a secular nation . 
  which bothers some of us quite a bit . 
  oh you sweet summer child . 
  well , we know what we are talking about there . 
  that does n't seem to make any sense , really . 
  and less cops , especially in the country side . 
  actually , the rising burglary/thievery rate is a huge issue here . 
  i think almost everybody knows at least one person who became victim of eastern european gangs . 
  that 's why we have so many `` visit poland , your car is already there '' jokes . 
  you ca n't vote csu outside of bavaria , though . 
  pretty sure what you saw was simply a difference between two companies , not two countries . 
  actually , taiwan number one . 
  one a more serious note , it is pretty interesting to see how the british establishment in politics , media and economy is often from generations of * very * upper class families . 
  personally , i prefer sauce hollandaise . 
  nope , more main stream, 
  as i explained in another comment , nobody in their right mind denies those . 
  but they seem especially unnecessary when talking about the whether , football , or whatever . 
  because with this , an artificial divide is kept alive , the so called `` wall in the heads '' . 
  oh yeah , absolutely . 
  only in the east a state could be governed by * die linke * . 
  but these differences also exist in a north-south divide . 
  and nobody would call bavaria or baden-w\u00fcrttemberg `` the south-german federal state '' . 
  and these differences are also brought up in the weirdest situations . 
  like `` the storm also hit the east-german state mecklenburg-vorpommern '' . 
  here , in the east , many do find getting called `` ex-ddr '' or even `` new federal states '' condescending and unnessecary . 
  i never really understood the problem with nord stream . 
  it saves us money and that 's nice . 
  there 's no threat to europe - you guys are still our buddies . 
  you just do n't any money from us for russian gas . 
  but why should you ? 
  do you see their voters complain ? 
  yes ? 
  the liberalisation of the cdu opened the space for the afd . 
   `` who would willingly sign up to kill ? '', 
   seems like a legit question though . 
  exactly , our country is very much not one `` where individuals are entitled to their views '' . 
  if your views do not the grundgesetz you are welcome to fuck right off . 
  we really , really need to teach this to newcomers - and right now , we are failing to do so . 
  but what is oss 117 ? 
  ever since they gained independence from chechenia , amirite ? 
  yeah i also never got that sentiment of `` you ca n't be proud for someone ele 's achievements '' . 
  of course you can !, 
  that 's why we take pride in the shitty pictures of our children . 
  a couple of years back i was in iran , where people explained to me how the jews where responsible not only for 9/11 but also for islamic extremism in the middle east . 
  you guys sure got your bases covered . 
  what role did jews play in polish communism ? 
  stalin purged the ussr and had most of the jews killed/exiled . 
  no prominent member of the pkwn was jewish . 
  stop repeating crap you read on / pol / . 
  that 's interesting . 
  so they are nationalist but do not agree with pan-slavic ideas out of fear of becoming russia 's bitch , right ? 
  what is their general stance towards the other neighboring nations ? 
  it does attract a shit load of americans though . 
  most germans under 30 know this sentence , it 's from a school book . 
  200 zloty . 
  i 'm really digging my own hole here , are n't i ? 
  anyway , my point stands : poland - and estonia , for that matter - is a first world country . 
  and the shitty parts of italy are [ super shitty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_regions_by_gdp ) , especially compared to northern italy or west europe in general . 
  campania and calabria have a gdp per capita on the level of estonia . 
  sure , it 's not scandinavia style rich , but surely it 's first world . 
  why though ? 
  i only know the polish cities , which are great - is the countryside * that * bad ? 
  worse than the shit parts of italy or greece ? 
  does anyone argue that poland is not a first world country ? 
   history has been way too kind to you lot since your attrocities . 
  you do n't even see the irony there , do you ? 
  why is shit like this acceptable ? 
  britain got btw more than twice as much from the marshall plan as germany .
