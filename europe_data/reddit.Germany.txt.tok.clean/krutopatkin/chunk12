  but the majority of germans is in favour of taking in refugees . 
   why do you think the left is losing its worker votes to anti-immigrant parties all across europe ? 
  not in germany though . 
  the biggest anti immigration party polls at 4 % . 
   or se asia are you being serious ? 
  you mean just like every single swedish turk bombs kurds . 
   and almost exclusively identify as conservative muslim and turks huh ? 
  where do you live ? 
  i barely know any turks who are actually practising muslims . 
   there is a reason why rich middle-eastern countries do n't take the refugees and other immigrants and they 'd rather give them $ 5-10k to go to europe . 
  source ? 
  no they 're generally not, 
  show me where exactly we are changing `` our laws and society '' . 
  and no , some rural hick village in bavaria does n't count , similar stuff happens all the time . 
  it 's the equivalent of screaming `` oh my god '' when you 're dying, 
  well yea , hence the afghan flag . 
   immigration has been the highest worry for europe for over a decade hence people vote for anti immigration parties , right ? 
  oh you read / r/worldnews too i see, 
  german one is the most accurate probably , as it 's based off the most recent census . 
  finnish accent also is the best english accent imho . 
  why are you not ? 
  yes , ~ 900 000 over a time of 10 years , 1,6 - 1,8 k daily in 1946 . 
  my tiny home town of 23k alone had 1 million refugees ( not at once , though ), 
  i like it . 
  do n't assume the majority holds the same opinion you do . 
  they want to create hate in the majority to isolate young muslims , in turn radicalizing them . 
  indonesia ? 
  except for aceh . 
  this is par of the course hence it makes national news huh, 
   \\ ^ ^ is okay there 's people using those in * literally every sentence * . 
  it absolutely infuriates me and discourages me from interacting with germans online . 
  but backwards in this context was used to describe social progress, 
  i wish other people were as proud of their language as the french tbh, 
  wow this guy has a opinion different to mine , he absolutely has to be a paid shill, 
  he does have an opinion , how is that a bad thing ? 
  according to this : http://m.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article7562534/die-bundeswehr-wird-zur-multireligioesen-armee.html there were 1k muslims in the german army in 2010 , so more than in the is now . 
   hoyerswerda incidentally the place of the [ hoyerswerda riots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoyerswerda_riots ), 
  it 's quite useful to be able to use both at times as they often use different sources , but i mostly use the english version . 
  why is burma not coloured in though , civil war is still going on . 
  of course it 's an issue but does it really warrant a 800 comment thread every time it is mentioned on reddit ? 
  it is quite clear to me that people outside that university care more about this than the people actually a part of the university ( because no one cares about student politics , ever ) , and to me this makes it quite clear that this is just people pushing their agenda . 
  because people want their biases to be reinforced . 
  it 's pretty obvious it 's not a big deal at the university itself with only 1,9 % signing the petition to remove her . 
   have you ever heard of a male diversity officer i 've never heard of a diversity officer to begin with, 
   we are not racists . 
  we are bitter about ourselves and has no problem calling a black man `` black '' ( negro in spanish ) . 
   funny , i remember my spanish teacher insisting very firmly to not use negro . 
  nobody uses that , ever . 
  it sounds pretty archaic and pretentious . 
  `` gro\u00dfbritannien '' ( `` great britain '' ) on the other hand is something you 'd hear on tv or if somebody is trying to be pedantic , and `` briten '' ( `` brits '' ) is fairly commonly used . 
  though still not as often as `` engl\u00e4nder '' . 
  treating people like humans ? 
  oh that 's just silly . 
  you 're going to grow up , do n't worry . 
  holy superiority complex man, 
  i feel sad for people who ca n't enjoy the beauty of dsds . 
  deutsch-europ\u00e4isch would be correct , but the rest was fine . 
  there is or used to be a thread on stormfront at least . 
  which party wants to abolish first past the post ? 
  [ 1922 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_on_rome ), 
  as is the case in almost every european country, 
  i think there was a scrooge mcduck comic that went like that . 
  are you implying d\u00f6ner is n't enough to satisfy all your fast food needs forever ? 
  kurdistan in turkey is still stupid . 
   they are n't big . 
  they are n't even medium . 
  this is absolutely hilarious coming from someone afraid of `` kill all cis white men sjws '' . 
  not to mention trp has 100k subscribers . 
   they 're kind of like vegans . 
  funny you say that considering people complaining about annoying vegans are far more numerous than actual `` in-your-face '' vegans . 
  ( i 'm yet to meet one in real life actually ), 
  there is / r/de and / r/deutschland which are both german, 
  armenia has a very nice tricolour as well . 
  not really , it 's not mutually intelligible with high german . 
  this map is just off in genera , corsica has the wrong colour , european turkey is not coloured in , the ijsselmeer disappeared , borders are just off in general . 
  when i was in school tons of people had watched that 3 guys 1 hammer video , and later on those mexican drug war beheadings . 
  there 's 6 left according to the german ( and esperanto ) wikipedia interestingly , i wonder what caused the difference . 
  why ? 
   non-existent in the rest of western europe ukip , pvv , sd area all pretty strong, 
  how is austria so much higher than germany ? 
  the mafia protects very well too, 
  well afaik he plans to live there permanently so at least there 's that . 
  huh , my uncle is planning to do that . 
  i apologize, 
  he apparently got shot , so idk if he wanted to be caught alive . 
  so what ? 
  still arrogant to assume it . 
  not to mention you probably live in a bubble if you believe everyone under 35 is able to understand journalistic questions in english . 
  cdu ? 
  wo n't take too long . 
  on the other hand , the afd was the biggest party in half of mannheim , which is rather . . multicultural . 
  1117 : slavery abolished in iceland . 
  [ 7 ] i realize england abolished it before that but that is pretty meaningless considering they then proceeded to partake in chattel slavery . 
   everyone forgets we were the first to ban slavery not even close, 
   that phase almost seamlessly flowed into the `` imperial phase '' after the declaration of the german empire in 1871 . 
  that time is known as gr\u00fcnderzeit ( founder 's age ), 
   erich honecker gets up in the morning and sees the sun rise in the east . 
  he says : `` good morning sun ! '', 
  and the sun answers : `` good morning erich ! '', 
  at noon he sees the sun again and says : `` good day , sun ! '',
