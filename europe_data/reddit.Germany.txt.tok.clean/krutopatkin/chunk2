  germany does n't ( though that is bound to change soon ), 
  in germany elementary school is either four or six years starting from age 6/7 depending on the state . 
  there is no middle school , but 3 different school types , which are either 5 , 6 or 8-9 additional years ( assuming 4 years elementary school ) . 
  also you can switch from the shorter ones onto the higher one if you want to and are able to . 
  so the first generation integrates , and their descendants assimilate ? 
  i 'm ok with that . 
  should really make you think tbh, 
  well both iraqis and western euros have a recent history of genocide that countries like poland and czechia just do n't have . 
  he 's german afaik . 
  are you stupid, 
   we 're forced into a rat race , to buy shit to impress people we do n't like . 
  liberals get the bullet too amirite, 
  it 'd be for the best . 
   it 's an anti-muslim piece copy pasted from `` the jewish chronicles '' how is reporting on antisemitic incidents in germany anti-muslim ? 
  and why do you try to make it about israel ? 
  have you realized by now non-israeli jews exist ? 
  this is not the article we are talking about . 
  we are talking about the article in the op , which does not mention israel - yet you make this all about israel , almost as if you have some agenda to push in regards to israel . 
  why does it matter ? 
  is talking about jews at all pro-israel propaganda ? 
  you realize not all jews are israelis , right ? 
  so everything related to jewish people is pro-israel propaganda to you ? 
  you seem a little obsessed . 
  so , in your opinion , muslim hate is pro-israel propaganda ? 
  i do n't see israel mentioned in the title . 
   they, 
   if israel continues to try and pushes to pick a side , i doubt it will work out in their favour , no matter how much they try to pick up the current anti muslim sentiment . 
   is this a threat ? 
  a jewish child being bullied is pro-israel propaganda ? 
  he did n't ? 
  probably a bitter frenchie, 
  not enough labels prolly, 
  ben `` one man klan '' garrison, 
  i doubt both terrorist attacks and migration movements will just stop after 2016 . 
  they also , like every right populist party in europe , managed to move the overton window to the right . 
  well her party was on course for 15 % before h\u00f6cke started going full nazi . 
  you realize her and h\u00f6cke are at odds right ? 
  petry represents the less radical wing of the party , while h\u00f6cke represents the far right and as such she 's the party 's only hope of winning lasting relevance . 
  i 'm fairly sure that , if the entire right wing of the afd stopped existing tomorrow they would gain votes in the long run .

  well it 's kind of the other way around for me - porn is way easier to find online than offline . 
   it was basically dominated by a small number of people with a specific ideological bent which bent ? 
  i 'd never do that , but i found it pretty ironic you made a spelling mistake while making fun of stupid people . 
  ngl i 'd never vote for an uglo, 
  well bild beats the second biggest german newspaper by a circulation of like 1,7 million . 
  hardly better . 
  what happened to lell anyway, 
  of the ones i understand , / r/unitedkingdom seems pretty terrible . 
  and i do n't speak swedish , but / r/sweden seems to be a little too much about the memes for me . 
  oh yea , the high-brow berliner morgenpost , advertising scarlett johansson semi-nudes on the frontpage . 
  we can only go from what she says . 
  anyways , neoliberal policies such as macron 's are always going to be controversial , especially with the leftist parts of the electorate . 
  le pen is n't economically liberal . 
  and she , too , is quite polarising in case you had n't noticed . 
  do n't you think history is important and worth remembering ? 
  he was the minister of economy , pushing through neoliberal reforms . 
  depends on how strong it is i guess ? 
  if it were to completely destroy any chance of macron getting the presidency ( like him murdering a hooker or something ) it would be more clever to release it before a le pen - macron 2nd round . 
  if it is something to damage him , but not completely kill his chances , releasing something before the 1st round would probably be the more clever thing to do . 
  well assuming an ( admittedly very unlikely ) fillon/le pen 2nd round , the margins are fairly close as well . 
  also , if russia have anything on macron , they are going to drop it after the first round . 
  except for every revolution ever . 
   i 'd like to see you guys take on tanks and drones that is what the war on terror has been for the past 1,5 decades .

  have you considered people having different interests than you ? 
  [ see here ] ( http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66261/1/hix_brexit%20matter_2016.pdf )  sweden , the netherlands and denmark are the uk 's closest allies in the eu council and would lose an important partner if brexit occurred ;, 
  the uk is oftentimes an important german ally in the european council . 
  this is an un projection taking this into account : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_future_population_ ( united_nations , _ medium_fertility_variant ), 
  yea , but what makes you think that wo n't change ? 
  wilders might retire , or die , and someone actually competent might take the reins . 
  if someone like wilders can become the second strongest party , what can someone intelligent and competent do ? 
   they certainly are n't right and lean more left than right . 
   they 're your standard european liberal party , maybe with a little more emphasis on the social liberal of liberal . 
   hardly . 
  [ sure sounds pro-immigration ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/02/immigrants-need-better-dutch-and-a-job-vvd/ )  they will never see support like this again . 
  what makes you think so ? 
  if they ever get an actual party program and somebody who actually campaigns they might do quite well . 
   a centre-right party that 'll be in coalition with two left-wing parties who also increased in voting share ? 
   d66 is hardly `` left-wing '' . 
   and since when was a standard right-wing party fascism ? 
  they might be wrong about most of their positions as are all right-wingers , but most are n't fascists . 
  not fascist , but anti-immigration  only losers like wilders and where is he now ? 
  the second strongest party in the netherlands ? 
   your own country proved that a couple of weeks ago . 
   by voting for right wing parties ? 
  i assume this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_future_population_ ( united_nations , _ medium_fertility_variant ), 
  [ assuming no birth rate change , the world population would be 28 billion in 2011 instead of 11 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_future_population_\\ ( united_nations , _ constant_fertility_variant \\ ) ), 
  so nowhere in sweden there are more women than men ? 
  more likely to attain higher education . 
  huh ? 
  no it 's not , it is based on the un 's projection of birth rates . 
  hence it stops at 11 billion . 
  what about gripen ? 
  eli5 different planes and their successes and failures ? 
  this was only 45 years after ww2 ended . 
  hard to imagine there not being any people who were afraid .
