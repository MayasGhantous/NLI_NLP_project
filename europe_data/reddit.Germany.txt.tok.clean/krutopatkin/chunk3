  idk about you , but i do n't trust the german army to defend against luxembourg , let alone russia . 
  and i dont know if the political will for an united european army will be there if russia invades , say , the estonian border regions . 
  would be worse for eastern europe tho, 
  force projection ? 
  and actually winning wars i guess . 
  well , there 's likely to be one after the next elections . 
   america never on a war mexico ? 
  revolutionary war ? 
  two world wars ? 
   but you are very good at killing innocent people . 
  yet they 're second to many countries in europe - most notably us . 
  czechoslovakie before the war was just as wealthy as austria and finland despite a complete lack of colonies . 
  pretty sure it was communism , not a lack of colonies , which turned eastern europe into its current state . 
  yea and some of the poorest cities , most conflict ridden zones are in europe too . 
  not in the eu , admittedly . 
  is this what swedes actually believe ? 
   also czech republic , most slavery . 
  sex trafficing i assume, 
  literally , yes . 
  is that his way of trying to bring fillon down ? 
  would be a lot more helpful if there were some kind of scale : s i guess all tall bars in the ee one are russian ? 
  interesting how you can see the end of the cold war on both scales . 
  what is considered as `` white '' is a social construct - and iranians certainly are n't considered `` white '' in germany . 
  * as of 2015, 
  who is the conspiracy theorist ? 
  these parties would have a majority right now , but the spd prefers working with the cdu . 
  this honestly something that makes me very wary about these civey polls . 
  `` 500 sexual assaults in the inner city , most in front of the train station '' would have been more accurate i guess . 
  i apologize . 
  i go to bonn university , one of the most diverse german universities iirc . 
  i 'd love to see more current polls , if you could provide any . 
  i agree the numbers have probably shrunk since then , as banning all non eu migration is ( unnecessarily ) radical . 
  no , 1.1 k crimes happened in cologne that night , 500 of which were sexual assaults . 
  2/3rd of the 1,1 k crimes happened in front/in hbf . 
  i guess you could analyse how many sexual assaults there were in front of hbf if you looked at the data welt used in the article at hand , springer published it in bild if you care enough . 
  what ? 
  sorry to point out 15-24 year olds arent exactly representative of all of germany . 
   and what `` directly in front of '' is supposed to mean ? 
  the area in front of the dom . 
   also , why is map showing something completely different then ? 
  it is n't , i do n't know if you noticed but you can see multiple events at once happening a lot in a certain part of the map . 
  that is the hbf and the bahnhofsvorplatz , where most of the crimes ( mainly sexual assault and thievery ) happened . 
  the police report literally said 2/3rd of crimes happened at hbf / directly in front of it . 
  i 'm sorry if that clashes with your perception of reality . 
  source ? 
  do you have anything to support that claim ? 
  pretty sure if western germany 's biggest train station became a sexual assault zone due to ethnic germans , there 'd be plenty reports . 
  there is also plenty of non-germans at the oktoberfest btw . 
  are you blind ? 
  the majority of incidents obviously take place in the hbf/in front of it . 
  the police report only supports that . 
  this is 15-24 year olds only . 
  also the questions are pretty loaded . 
  whataboutism . 
  never has anything similar to the cologne sexual assaults happened in germany . 
  the oktoberfest for example , which lasts way longer and where millions go had a fraction of the amount of sexual assaults ( [ 26 in 2015 , for example ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-09/oktoberfest-muenchen-frauen-sexuelle-uebergriffe ) ), 
   if you have anything suggesting that attitude changed , go ahead . 
  polls like [ this ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-08/zuwanderung-migration-internationale-umfrage-europa ) suggest that attitude hasnt changed . 
  also , banning all non-eu immigration includes banning highly qualified specialists , which , as far as i can tell , most of this sub doesnt support . 
   the minute they point their finger at their boyfriends , husbands , fair-skinned partygoers , literally anyone who is not disliked by them , the narrative jumps to either silence or that we need to listen to both sides of the story / they were asking for it / feminism is destroying the west , blah blah . 
  so because they 're not the only ones committing crimes we are supposed to ignore the biggest mass sexual assault in the history of modern germany ? 
  if you have anything suggesting that attitude changed , go ahead . 
  polls like [ this ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-08/zuwanderung-migration-internationale-umfrage-europa ) suggest that attitude hasnt changed . 
   in fact germans take pride in having internationally diverse universities . 
  we do ? 
   and there was no one convicted according to wikipedia page on that incident this is not the case by the way , though most perpetrators got away without repercussions as it is hard to catch people committing crimes from a big crowd . 
  here you can see a map of all crimes that night : https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article152018368/1054-strafanzeigen-nach-uebergriffen-von-koeln.html as you can see the vast majority of them happens near the central station and in the surrounding area . 
  in international media maybe . 
  not in german . 
   so there were allegedly 5 victims of rape and by rape they most probably mean groping because that 's how strict german law is iirc . 
  it `` s not strict at all actually , rape means penetration  and there was no one convicted according to wikipedia page on that incident . 
  oh that 's just great . 
  500 sexual assaults in cologne 's inner city , most of which happened in front of western germany 's most important train station and nobody got convicted ? 
  pretty sure that means nothing actually happened . 
   it seems like exactly what article is describing - exaggeration to create confusion and distrust . 
  how was it exaggerated ? 
  http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2016-06/henriette-reker-armlaenge-aeusserung-fehler he literally linked it , 1,2 k victims , 497 sexual assaults in cologne alone . 
  most germans are unhappy with non-eu immigration . 
  they just are n't single issue voters . 
  balts just need to learn russian i guess . 
   the republic of macedonia roughly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of paeonia , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] which was located immediately north of the ancient kingdom of macedonia . 
  [ 27 ] paeonia was inhabited by the paeonians , a thracian people ,, 
  [ thracians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thracians ) according to [ wikipedia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_macedonia#ancient_and_roman_period ), 
   if all european countries were equally accepting of refugees , the countries on this chart would all have a similar number of asylum claims per capita . 
  yea i am sure refugees would just stream to latvia . 
  do you think foreigners are unable to improve their own countries ? 
  quite ignorant of you . 
  enough time for the hype to die down , yes . 
  yet the poorest part of germany has the highest birth rate , probably due to great pre-kindergarten care, 
   then fix job and basic security . 
  90 % of what is stopping people from having children is anxiety , usually relating to finances . 
  yea that 's why germany and japan have some the lowest birth rates in the world . 
  what did he say about algeria ? 
  same guy according to german radio, 
  please look up the function of the old testament in christianity . 
   of course , nothing like that ever happened in germany . 
  indeed it has not , at least not in modern germany . 
  knowing ? 
  look at this dangerous intellectual here , comrades .
