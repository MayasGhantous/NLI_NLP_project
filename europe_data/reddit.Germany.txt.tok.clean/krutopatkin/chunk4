  off to the gulag !, 
  yea but that would be a pretty easy and onesided debate . 
  leader of the more free than the other worlds world :\\ ^ )  sure if you wan na think that . 
  well i like being right . 
  that was accurate though ? 
  the us was the most important and leading first world country during the cold war . 
   trying to install a muslim ban is not a thing that germans like to see , for certain reasons . 
   [ do they , though . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/majority-of-europeans-favor-trump-style-immigration-ban/a-37485655 ), 
  well it 's not completely wrong as the d'hondt method favors larger parties slightly . 
  it 's just a bit rich coming from a british newspaper . 
   worn out clich\u00e9 about the danger of helping jews, 
  yea that 's what i meant . 
  closely associating with the nutcase that is trump ca n't be healthy for wilders . 
  i 'd argue trump and brexit are part of the reason they cant capitalize on the migrant crisis . 
  yea that 's not really the case in europe . 
  it 's not completely uncommon , anti-immigrant parties are somewhat succesful in plenty of cities , for example the afd in mannheim or the fn in marseille . 
  even in berlin the afd got 14 % . 
  try to not see european politics through the lense of the american urban/rural dichotomy . 
  i wonder how that 1 denk voter on urk feels . 
  by the way , how did sp manage to lose votes considering the complete collapse of pvda ? 
  i realize , i just find it funny not seeing their color on the map . 
  so pvda wo n't win a single district ? 
  they were , limburg ( the south ) is the pvv 's stronghold . 
  uk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_uk_top_10_singles_in_2015#weeks_by_artist http://www.amccinemas.co.uk/amc-manchester/ especially cinema is dominated by the us to an incredible amount . 
  american baseball caps are the most popular headwear there is right now ( mileage may vary depending on your location ) , you should pay attention . 
  idk where you 're from , so i 'll take germany : http://www.kino.de/filme/aktuell/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_singles_by_year_ ( germany ) # 2016 the us dominates both . 
  using 500 million people as a number is a little disingenuous as these people are unlikely to move to the czech republic or poland . 
  and 2010-2013 just happens to be just before the current immigration increase . 
  not really , centrists vote for macron and the right wingers vote for fillon . 
  it 's only the left that is split . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  itt : europeans unable to have a thread about an european election without obsessively mentioning the us . 
  depends on where you 're from , if you 're a continental it 's fairly likely . 
   i am one of those people after all that wishes nato to cease . 
  i take it you do n't live in eastern europe ? 
  because the us is nice enough to spend all their money on military . 
  you wish, 
  the music , tv shows , movies and fast food most popular in europe . 
  oh ok , is that distinction common in the netherlands ? 
  what is d66 ' stance on immigration ? 
  what do you mean by `` new left '' ? 
  tbf fptp discourages turnout . 
  he was too close to trump i guess . 
  obsessed, 
  the top 3 comments of this thread are about america , lmao . 
  any reason you voted for number 9 , or did you just like his name ? 
  that 's not what this link says - it says you need to believe the bible to be the verbally inspired word of god , meaning that god inspired the authors , but it is not god 's own words . 
  more info on that here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biblical_inspiration, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerakan_mujahidin_islam_patani https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_bali_bombings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_sayyaf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moro_islamic_liberation_front https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moro_national_liberation_front https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_liberation_front_of_patani https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jemaah_islamiyah, 
   you know , when christians destroyed centuries worth of scientific progress and decided to torture witches instead of pursuing mathematics like the muslim-bros .  til the byzantine empire was n't a thing . 
  liberal democracy does not mean `` democracy where a left leaning party is in power '' , fyi . 
  most people probably vote after work, 
  are these tables from some site ? 
  i mean , turkey is consistently at the bottom of all these polls . 
  turkey being one of the more moderate muslim countries does n't mean they are moderate in an absolute sense , but in relation to other muslim countries . 
  [ no ] ( http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/04/gsi2-overview-1.png ), 
   when was the last dictator propped up by muslim leader ? 
  are you aware of who finances the assad regime foremostly ? 
  turkey is ( still ) one of the most liberal muslim there is . 
   most christians believe that only parts dealing with the moral law ( as opposed to ceremonial law ) are still applicable , others believe that none apply https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_views_on_the_old_covenant meaning your first example still holds true - your second does n't . 
  hence one is well known , one is n't . 
  `` perfect '' was the wrong choice of words as he did commit mistakes , though not in terms of religion . 
   it was reported that raafi ' ibn khudayj said : the prophet ( peace and blessings of allaah be upon him ) came to madeenah , and they were pollinating the date-palms . 
  he said , `` what are you doing ? '' they said , `` we always used to pollinate them . '' he said , `` perhaps if you do not do that , it will be better . '' so they did not do it , and the harvest was lacking . 
  they mentioned that to him , and he said , `` i am only a human being like you . 
  if i tell you to do something with regard to religion , then follow it , but if i tell you to do something based on my own opinion , i am only a human being . '' ( narrated by muslim , 2361 ) . 
  the point of muhammas as example to follow stands though :  http://www.darul-arqam.org.sg/what-is-islam/muhammad-model-for-mankind/, 
  thanks man , 
   most christians believe that only parts dealing with the moral law ( as opposed to ceremonial law ) are still applicable , others believe that none apply https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_views_on_the_old_covenant anyway , the bible has the advantage of not being the literal word of god , and as such is a lot easier for christians to ignore . 
  [ and it is not like the quran is a stranger to rape . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/3h1abm/this_is_dr_jonathan_brown_professor_at_georgetown/cu3dkhd/?st=j0ae8ho3&amp;sh=166a6bb9 ), 
  his actions were irrelevant if he were n't perceived as the perfect man whose life is to be imitated by a religion of billions . 
  but he is . 
  so how was the debate ? 
  so how was the debate ? 
  is there any english/german/dutch ( in that order ) write-up on it ? 
  he always does , does n't he ? 
  lots of little splinter parties, 
   more educated more [ ... ] leftist  which country is this not true ? 
  most of the world ? 
  the educated typically vote center-right/classically liberal ( and green , at least in germany ) . 
  [ actually ] ( https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/34624859/erdogan-warns-netherlands-after-ministers-expulsion/#page1 )  cavusoglu , meanwhile , is set to address a rally in the eastern french city of metz on sunday . 
   the french foreign ministry has cleared his visit , a french official said . 
  yea and as a result millions of votes were ignored last election, 
   the scared older generation but the older generation is the generation voting for the fn the least ? 
  https://www.vn.nl/vernieuw-de-democratie-en-snel/ said reputable dutch newspaper, 
   this article has to be taken with a barrel of salt , if only because of its source . 
  it is fairly easy to look up the source , i only took this site because it was the only english publication reporting the poll , but there is reputable dutch newspapers reporting about the same poll . 
  well , where are you from ? 
  i mean i know lots of these , but i guess the topic never came up . 
  / r/europe makes you federalistic ? 
  yea i honestly do n't know of anyone i know irl who is in favor of european federalism . 
  what the fuck is it with this sub and its obsession with federalism, 
  wasnt bandera in a kz when these crimes happened ? 
  fillon voters , more likely . 
  le pen does by far the worst with the old . 
   and they already control like 25 % of the country . 
  they do n't , actually . 
  they 're pretty much beaten .
