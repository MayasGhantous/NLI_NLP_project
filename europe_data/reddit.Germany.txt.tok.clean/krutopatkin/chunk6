  yea i live in the rhineland , i guess people here realized only k\u00f6lsch all day is n't great : , 
   but yea it would be nice to be able to find belgian style , imperial stouts , ipas , and other variations like oatmeal stout really ? 
  because my local ( not very big ) edeka getr\u00e4nkemarkt has ipas , belgian beer and all that weird craft beer stuff . 
  no , i meant pforzheim , where the afd won a direct mandate in the regional elections . 
  not their mayor , their mandate in the baden-w\u00fcrttemberg parliament . 
  yet germany 's most multi cultural city voted a far right candidate in . 
  well the chinese are the jews of south east asia kind of . 
  yea i am sure everyone is fully able to consent to take part in these courts at all times . 
   a lot of what the tories do in the uk would n't be tolerated in germany . 
  can you give an example ? 
  you realize 2/3rds of syrians here are functionalkly illiterate in their own language , right ? 
  somehow i doubt these are the people who are going to save our economy and save us from falling birth rates . 
  cheaper tho, 
  that is wrong though . 
  about your video , hogesa is mostly active in western germany , the scene in the beginning is at cologne central station . 
  not in france afaik, 
  not in france afaik, 
   globalism is not identical to multi culturalism  propagating that might make globalism a whole lot more popular, 
   are there examples of nationalist success ? 
  pretty much every country in existence, 
   and a bit of humor dae joke about the death of millions of people by using the symbolism of the perpetrator of said deaths ? 
  here in my part of germany ( near cologne ) every bathing lake i know of also has a fkk area, 
  they 've got regulat intercommunal religious violence and a communist insurrection though thats pretty good for a country of its size, 
  same with scorpions , right ? 
  i mean you could also take a look at real life genocides committed by communists . 
  i mean it 's hardly surprising a subreddit dedicated to a certain candidate/ideology bans people opposing said candidate/ideology . 
  how is this agitation though ? 
  it does n't say `` germans killed people back then , and by importing refugees they 're doing the same thing now again '' . 
  they 're just commemorating the event . 
  tifos are a big part of enjoying football . 
  idk not cry because a banner dares to state that it was germans who committed these murders ? 
  apparently the germans will never forgive the poles for the warsaw uprising either . 
  the same reason minutes of silence etc. 
  happen in football matches ? 
  eh the atrocities comitted towards slavs are a lot less well known and taught in germany than the ones comitted towards jews . 
   location warsaw ? 
  there was nothing comparable to the vichy government in poland . 
   modern germans do n't separate themselves from what nazi germany did = = omg neo nazis  never seen anyone say that . 
  you might be arguing against strawmen, 
  ca n't even kill a few million people without being reminded of it , so rude . 
  that 's france, 
  why are two nato states rh\u00fbn ? 
  also gdr is the better ithilien imo, 
  [ well , kind of ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism ) though that ended in poland in 1956, 
  many , if not all , groups do , but some are vastly overepresented in both crime and unemployment, 
  quite the opposite tbh, 
  well , originally and france did start that intervention in libya and we do support the saudis bombing yemen, 
  [ speaking from experience ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/courland_pocket ), 
  nah there was a story about some invoice handed to merkel by trump which turned out to be fake, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/61mrca/zu_donald_trump_k\u00fcsse_angela_merkel/ i guess `` based on literal fake news '' would have been more accurate, 
  it might be just me , but the video seems fairly quiet . 
  you could try talking louder next time . 
  daily reminder the / r/de top post is literal fake news, 
  worth nothing this is / r/germany , which is shit . 
  though the top post of / r/de is literal fake news upvoted by idiot americans . 
  shit news sites are okay if they belong to your side ? 
  you cant make me, 
  does it ? 
  most american alt-rightists are hardcore nazis . 
  omitting crimea completely is an interesting solution to the crimea map dilemma . 
  how does he blame them ? 
   unsigned article  article by wn.com correspondent dallas darling . 
  it 's german state media : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_welle, 
  cuz bavaria does consistently great by many measures, 
  this is actually fairly interesting as the amount of women with abitur is higher than the amount of men . 
  that 's his point , the us could have both an amazing health care system and a huge military without spending a dime differently . 
  where myanmar ranks below zambia, 
  [ see here ] ( http://cdn20.se.smcloud.net/t/photos/thumbnails/119481/ilu_polakow_chodzi_do_kosciola_640x0_rozmiar-niestandardowy.jpg ) from here : https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/6nnql3/bible_belts_of_europe_oc_568_x_412/dkat9bo/?st=j57couuk&amp;sh=018b8b5a, 
   vietnam and ukraine are still light years ahead in terms of education and social services compared to nigeria and zambia . 
  fair enough , but you 'll find plenty of other examples . 
  bangladesh for example is poorer and has a higher infant mortality rate than ghana , yet it also has only about half its birth rate . 
   and while myanmar might be poor , they seem to have a high rate of abortions , late marriages and socially accepted celibacy . 
  that 's the point , is n't it ? 
  if african countries had all these things , their birth rate issues would n't be as bad . 
  but they do n't , despite being similarly wealthy , i.e. 
  these things do n't have to come automatically with being a wealther nation . 
   their population also does n't rely on self sufficiency farming to stay alive . 
  do you mean subsistence farming ? 
  because 65 % of myanmar 's population lives off agriculture , and especially in the states this is mostly subsistence farming . 
  does this hold true though ? 
  compare vietnam , nigeria and ukraine for example . 
  all have very similar nominal gdp/capita values , yet their birth rates are 1.8 , 4.0 and 1.3 , respectively . 
  or myanmar vs zambia : similar nominal gdp/capita , but the birth rates are 2.3 ( almost as low as france ) vs 5.4 ( one of the highest in the world ) . 
  both are colloquial actually . 
  you could , but you might run into communication issues . 
  it 's just colloquial term for the uk . 
   you kinda screwed us in 1939-1945 that 's a nice way of spelling mass murder, 
  [ also this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror_\\ ( spain \\ ) ), 
  what a waste of money, 
  really ? 
  what field are you in ? 
   thanks to the internet you do n't need to be in london to experience ground breaking music before everyone else . 
  you still want to experience it live ideally . 
  pretty much every single published paper from germany is going to be in english, 
  at least in germany those are for the most part master 's programmd . 
  i guedd it 's different in the netherlands eg but universizy is n't free there either . 
  actually more germans migrate from big cities to rural areas than vice versa : http://m.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/wohnen-in-deutschland-immer-mehr-menschen-zieht-es-aufs-land-a-1109484.html, 
  worth noting that there is a significant amount of russophile people in germany . 
  it 's not true though ? 
  there were plenty of assimilated and nationalist ( especialy among former soldiers ) jews .
