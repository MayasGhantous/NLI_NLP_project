i 've been using it for months !, 
  2/3rds seems like an unsustainable number to cull , which might leave the rest vulnerable to disease and inbreeding , but it is true that these animals are n't endangered overall , only rare in norway . 
  i 'm pretty surprised that ukraine is ` poorer ' than kazakhstan . 
  that would only be referring to either partial employment where the worker still requires government assistance , or government-funded employment ( the government paying the employer to employ the refugee ) . 
  and these jobs might be part time or seasonal . 
  if we are talking about actual jobs the worker can support themselves on without government funding ( either directly to the refugee or indirectly through the employer ) , about 25 % have a job after 8 years and 34 % after 15 years , according to the article . 
  here 's sweden : http://www.di.se/artiklar/2016/4/7/ledare-integrationen-mer-akut-an-vad-vi-trodde/ denmark is not allowing me to link because it 's from the local . 
  in germany , 50 % of people granted asylum are gainfully employed after 15 years . 
  in sweden it 's 30 % . 
  in denmark it 's 25 % . 
  i 'm speaking in generalities but i 'm saying they do n't contribute to the work force . 
  workers \u2260 refugees refugees do not work , anywhere . 
  the quicker people understand this , the better . 
  white guilt, 
  why are you afraid of women dude, 
  freedom of movement . 
  they 'll live where they want to , which usually means they 'll cluster together in the major cities of the most generous countries . 
  italy was promised the south tyrol region if they joined the allies in wwi . 
  there 's not really much of a separatist movement there as far as i know . 
  they seem happy to retain their german language and somewhat austrian/bavarian/alpine culture while remaining apart of italy . 
  it helps that they 're given a good amount of autonomy by the government , after some previous efforts to `` italianize '' the region and people . 
  hitler actually agreed to the expulsion of all germans in the region and mussolini planned to repopulate it with italians , and the tyrolians were intended to help colonize parts of eastern europe . 
  did you type them out properly ? 
  what does north korea have to do with afd ? 
  and what makes afd , or any of the rising populist parties in europe , `` worse than the nazis '' in your estimation ? 
  nice . 
  timisoara is on my bucket list to visit . 
  this is more egregious than the invasion of crimea . 
  how many other chinese could use this as precedent to apply for asylum ? 
  do pakistanis cause problems ? 
  i 'm asking why brits are targeting poles and not the foreigners that actually cause problems . 
  i did n't claim they all were ?

  well , nobody 's doing anything about them . 
  so country-wide pakistani rape gangs are okay but polish migrant workers cross the line ? 
  i 'm not sure , i do n't think that can be accurately quantified . 
  asylum seekers by and large ca n't / do n't work , anywhere . 
  this is nothing new . 
  i thought it was strange . 
  it shows berlin in orange too . . which was of course pretty much completely destroyed in ww2 . 
  absolutely triggering . 
  atilla is a badass first name . 
  i look back at the situation in molenbeek where the most wanted man in europe was able to walk around in broad daylight for weeks and nobody even alerted authorities . 
  and in fact when authorities finally tracked him down and arrested him , they were pelted with rocks by the locals . 
  molenbeek may be a unique situation . 
  pew , icm etc. 
   and 99 % of them are peaceful source ? 
  polls suggest otherwise . 
  snow in canadian : https://youtu.be/b0ygvypbwya, 
  ahh that 's good . 
  and he 'll have access to hundreds of inmates that are at risk of radicalization . 
   analysts say that the public voiced little opposition after 5,000 poles and 3,300 americans , among other westerners , emigrated to denmark in 2014 , but that there has been significant criticism of the nearly 16,000 syrian asylum seekers who arrived that year and the next . 
  maybe it 's because the poles & americans actually contribute . 
  i 'd at least wait and see if it had any impact on birthrates before declaring that it `` backfired . '', 
  what studies ? 
  swedes are emigrating in record numbers . 
  i 'm sure it 's for a myriad of reasons , but at the end of the day it 's mostly because sweden is getting worse , and other places are becoming more attractive to them . 
  maybe it 's not everyone else , maybe it 's sweden . 
  consider it . 
  ask yourself why swedes are leaving sweden at record numbers . 
  there is a global conspiracy against sweden , clearly . 
  and ? 
  germans are choosing to have less kids . 
  therefore , they clearly * want * their population to decrease . 
  let it happen naturally . 
  germany 's population was n't always 88 million , and it was just fine . 
  populations do n't have to perpetually increase . 
  that 's unsustainable . 
  as is relying on immigration to supplant birthrates . 
  300,000 more this year . . 
  i dunno ... sounds kinda like a surge to me . 
  that 's more than the population of mannheim . 
  i 'm talking about political and social circles in sweden , not just reddit forums . 
  as a swede you have to concede that a lot of worthwhile discussions on issues like immigration and integration are completely shot down by the left as racism or xenophobia . 
  as if anyone that wants tighter borders must inherently be a nazi . 
  i 'm not swedish but have a few friends and acquaintances who are and can corroborate this . 
  the us sends about half a billion in foreign aid to mexico every year . 
  putting that towards the wall would pay for a huge chunk of it in a few years . 
  about 20 % of the border is already walled , anyway . 
  do n't denounce all critics of unfettered immigration as racist . 
  but , also , to the critics of the immigration policies , do n't let yourself be easily silenced by baseless accusations of racism . 
  i only read road signs . 
  how about move them all back from whence they came . 
  it 's unthinkable that stone-age nomads dropped into a modern western society would have trouble integrating . . it must be systemic racism instead . 
  wow , 48 !, 
  only 200,000 remaining !, 
  `` secure borders '' simply means keeping track of who comes and who goes and preventing mass waves of people from entering . 
  north korea does n't let anyone come * or * go . 
  not comparable . 
  ah yes ... the problem is geography , not policy . 
  if the balkan states had n't built walls germany would be looking at 3-4 million migrants right now . 
  i do not understand why so many leaders are so profoundly against protecting and defending its boarders , particularly from waves of unvetted intruders . 
  it is a completely alien concept to me . 
  they 've just reached peak diversity . 
  this would be cool . 
  maybe do n't allow your entire economy to hinge on one agreement . 
  the us & canada are able to properly vet a lot of the refugees they allow in ( with the exception of the cubans ) , and while i 'm not sure about the us , canada in particular tends to favor bringing over entire families . 
  in europe , they allow in simply anyone who 's willing and able to cross the borders to get there . 
  mostly it 's young , healthy men .
