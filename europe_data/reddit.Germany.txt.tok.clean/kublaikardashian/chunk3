  but even if/when birthrates level off , you have to factor in family reunification for refugees + continued migration from mena . 
  it 's not stopping . 
  25 million is a lot . 
  also consider the number is increasing exponentially while the non-muslim population is stagnant or decreasing . 
  it projects to be 50 million in 25-50 years . 
  but many have extremist sympathies , or beliefs that would be considered incompatible with western values . 
  possibly as many as 1 in 4 . 
  why does hollande think that bombing syria & iraq is going to do a damn thing about the thousands of jihadists that were born , raised , and are currently living in france ? 
  so he had to flee syria because of isis . . only to pledge allegiance to isis once he got to germany ? 
  absolutely . 
  asylum seekers should be on their best behavior . 
  i think it 's somewhere in the dublin regulations ... if a person is liable to be chopped to bits upon their return to their country of origin , the host country is obligated to protect him/her regardless of what crimes he 's committed . 
  committing crimes does n't necessarily mean a person 's asylum application will be rejected , as crazy as that may sound . 
  `` violence existed in germany previously , so it 's okay to import more violence from other parts of the world . '', 
  what religion was the perp ? 
  i 'm not sure but i think letting in millions of muslims every year is not part of that solution . 
  i think he only had a handgun, 
  guns are legal in germany, 
  i think people saw the guy on the roof of the garage , then again on the sidewalk , then probably again running away , and surmised there were 3 . 
  i 'm sure the police do n't take any chances and continue looking . 
  source ? 
  the fact that this guy could find 5 people in his circle of friends & acquaintances to help him kill dozens of people is pretty alarming to me . 
  that 's a real shame . 
  everything radicalizes muslims . 
  yeah , but i 'm not sure how much . 
  of the foreign-born people in germany ( whom make up 15 % of the total population ) , how many of them are ethnic germans ? 
  maybe 1/8th ? 
  i agree it lacks some context . 
  a decent portion of immigrants in germany are actually ethnically german . 
  it 's 2016 and you ca n't even drag your veiled wife around on a chain in public without arousing suspicion . 
  islamists : stern but fair . 
  it 's the same in the us somali communities as well . 
  plus the added bonus of somali gangs and somalis flying back to the middle-east to fight for al shabab & isil . 
  only 1/3rd of refugees have a job after 15 years . 
  only about half of people granted asylum in germany are employed after * 15 years * in the country . 
  which is actually one of the highest figures in the eu from what i 've seen . 
  it 's not really hollande 's fault that previous administrations let millions of north africans into france . 
  it 's not like this is the first incident . 
  there 's been about a half dozen major attacks in only a few years . 
  coming soon to : germany , sweden , uk, 
  sweden never disappoints, 
  the less educated encounter a different type of diversity than the more educated . 
  are you aware that only 50 % of refugees in germany and 30 % of refugees in sweden are gainfully employed after 15 years in each country ? 
  someone should educate swedes & germans on the employment rate of the refugees that 've been in their country for decades . 
  i hope they fry the bastards . 
  yeah . 
  or cologne 's mayor , an open-borders , pro-migrant politician whose previous job was being responsible for foreigner integration . 
  check out what he said about islam, 
  1/3rd of newborn births are, 
  if they do n't like it there are over 30 muslim-majority countries where burkas are perfectly legal . 
  will they be deported ? 
  or will their asylum applications merely be declined . 
  why would someone else 's skin color make you `` happy '', 
  only some , apparently . 
  others are less likely to be seen as suspects than even natives . 
  there 's still a clear pattern and a very serious problem that germany is only compounding with even more immigration from certain regions of the world . 
  reker , meanwhile , is still pro mass migration and pro open borders . 
  even the levels before the crisis are too high, 
  walls work . 
  immediate deportation deters ( but does n't completely eliminate ) future attempts . 
  it 's almost like unprecedented immigration levels lead to a rise in nativism and nationalism . 
  who ` da thunk it . 
  are antifa and pro refugee groups xenophiliacs ? 
  good article imo . 
  i am completely blown away by the statistic that children born to foreign-born mothers has tripled in the uk in 25 years to 27 % of all newborns . 
  and equally perplexed by britons ' indifference to it . 
  hopefully they 're delivered safely back to north africa . 
  higher birthrates than * natives * , which was my original question . 
  i asked : `` what are the birthrates of muslims in sweden vs. 
  you answered : `` given that muslims in austria appear to have a birth rate of 1.8 i assume it ca n't be that much off in sweden . '', 
  so i think we 're in agreement now that muslims have higher birthrates . 
  if 6 % of the population is responsible for 13 % of the newborn births , that shows that muslim birthrates are * not * comparable to non-muslims in austria . 
  so i will assume that it 's the same in sweden . 
  uhh , you brought up austria first , not me . 
  all those events are relatively recent and are the result of sweden 's overly generous refugee & immigration policies . 
  i left out the fact that sweden is now exporting terrorists to the middle east , as many as 300 as of last year . 
  three times the number of swedes that joined the nazis during ww2 . 
  only 1/3rd of refugees in sweden are employed after * 15 years * yet they 've kept bringing in tens of thousands more every single year . 
  face it , sweden 's immigration policy is completely off the rails . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_stockholm_riots https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_sweden_riots https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_rinkeby_riots https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_are_sthlm_sexual_assaults https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_alexandra_mezher, 
  why are you putting words in my mouth ? 
  and why are you suggesting that the swedish democrats dropping to 17 % is some kind of victory ? 
  they were under 4 % 6 years ago . 
  crime , terrorism , the rising popularity of far-right political groups . 
  in austria , 13 % of new births in 2014 were to muslim mothers , despite being 6 % of the population . 
  so i guess this is an admission by the left & centrist parties that sweden has been too lenient for too long , and their kindness has been taken advantage of , and it 's caused turmoil in their country ? 
  what are the birthrates of muslims in sweden vs. non-muslims ? 
  are they both 1.9 children per woman ? 
  i doubt it . 
  well , they 're bringing in tens of thousands per year , their birthrates are higher than natives ( which are below replacement ) , and native swedes are also leaving sweden in record numbers . 
  25 % might be a high end projection but i do n't think it 's without merit . 
  it 's not the biggest issue in germany right now , that 's for sure . 
  even the migrants are burning their own shelters . 
  i think the bigger threat to germany right now is n't racism , it 's unfettered immigration . 
  half of the posts in this forum over the past 6 months are about turkey or turks doing bat-shit crazy things . 
  i guess i do n't follow . 
  remain in the eu , to combat globalization ? 
  a phobia indicates irrationality . 
  i think that wanting less immigration from islamic countries is very rational . 
  i 'd be concerned as to why such a small percentage of the population seems to make themselves seem so much larger in * every * country polled .
