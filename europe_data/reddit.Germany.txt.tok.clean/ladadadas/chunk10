  czech republic allows child marriage too ! 11 http://www.genderindex.org/sites/default/files/datasheets/cz.pdf, 
   `` we are going to fight the pedophilia !, 
  we are talking about 16 and 17 year olds . 
  by that definition even most of the us allows pedophilia . 
   how denying infant baptism leads to leftist politics seems legit . 
  good job we sold kuka to the chinese already . 
  robotics wo n't be an important part of the industry in the future anyway . 
  http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/713111/gerwald-claus-brunner-german-pirate-party-politician-murder-suicide-berlin people assumed it was a double suicide first . 
  pirate party members wrote lovely letters that a least he could end his life with the guy he loved so much . 
  turns out it was n't actually love but stalking that ended in a homocide . 
  the un disagrees : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe, 
  isis claims something without any indications that it 's actually true and everybody believes it . 
  how 's that not mass hysteria . 
  so , you 're not even german but sure about it . 
  sure buddy . 
   the school 's principal , renate fritzsche said that there are no exceptions to germany 's mandatory school law . 
   we also have muslim children with us and muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions , '' she told ndr , emphasizing that muslim children must take part in swimming lessons and sex education . 
   the goal of education , fritzsche emphasized , is to teach children about other cultures so they will be able to interact and tolerate them . 
   yet the german establishment attempted to cover up the cologne attacks . 
  just check google when the articles came up . 
  visiting a place is n't forcing religion on someone though . 
  while being in school we went to a mosque , a synagogue and several churches . 
  nobody ever gave a fuck . 
  to me this is just another part of the whole outrage and safe space culture we have today . 
  you do n't catch a bad case of islam by visiting a mosque . 
   `` apple has raised its prices everywhere , but the uk has been hit worse than most '', 
   the school 's principal , renate fritzsche said that there are no exceptions to germany 's mandatory school law . 
   `` we also have muslim children with us and muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions , '' she told ndr , emphasizing that muslim children must take part in swimming lessons and sex education . 
  yes , i do n't see the problem . 
  ... and an assurance that the government will compensate all possible tariffs . 
  but i find hard to believe that it should be that low for informatiker in germany . 
  the big management consultant companies pay a starting salary of  80t $ ( yes , totally different segment ) and engineers at the big car companies will start with more than 50t $ . 
  and sap should be the same . 
  i believe that the variance for informatiker is pretty high tough . 
   software developer starting salaries in the uk often average 40,000 eur + right out of university . 
  that 's way higher than italy , france , germany , no , not germany :  informatiker z\u00e4hlen in vielen branchen zu den spitzenverdienern . 
   most of these non-europeans are eastern european wat . 
  ah yes , you 're one of the concerened citizens that pray for terror attacks and the death of people because it proves your point . 
   just as bad as breitbart the only thing as bad as breitbart is infowars . 
  i was only trying to say that you ca n't brush aside the argument by saying the government is popular . 
  i do n't really have enough knowledge about polish politics to call the government authoritarian . 
  vladimir putin has an 83 percent approval rating . 
  so he 's doing things more than twice as good than the polish government . 
  no wonder the little euro piggies envy the mighty russian bear . 
  yes , that 's why sweden is ranked number 1 ... 
   leading german newspaper in 2014 : is wants to disguise terrorists as refugees [ source ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/is-will-terroristen-als-fluechtlinge-tarnen-13190052.html ) who exactly called you a conspiracy theorist ? 
  auto translated from the management summary :  taken together , the different behavior of active and passive hft actors cause an increased risk of episodes with excessive volatility leading to market distortions or even flash events [ source ] ( http://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/de/downloads/veroeffentlichungen/monatsberichte/2016/2016_10_monatsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  and what exactly is wrong with our courts ? 
  is there no rule of law in canada or the eu ? 
  europe + mexico + australia during eurovision . 
   1 ) clinton is the candidate in favor of more foreign interventions . 
  and was bad at them when she was secretary of state . 
  look at libya . 
  unlike donald `` bomb the shit out of them '' trump who wants to go after the families of terrorists and bring back `` hell worse '' methods than waterboarding ? 
   2 ) dnc staffers have been caught on tape facilitating thug politics and voter fraud . 
  found by project veritas . 
  ** notable donors include donald trump ** , who in may 2015 donated $ 10,000 through his trump foundation . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_o%27keefe#voter_fraud_.282014.29 )  7 ) trump 's actual policies ? 
  they are popular . 
  yes , popular among retards without the slightest economic knowledge . 
  `` trump has vowed to impose tariffs -- in the range of 15 percent to 35 percent -- on companies like indiana-based carrier , which is moving its operations to mexico . '', 
  [ `` trump suggests leaving wto over import tax proposal '' ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/finance/289005-trump-suggests-leaving-wto-over-import-tax-proposal ) that 's a `` how to kill the economy in 2 months plan '' . 
   i dont get it , why ? 
  basic empathy mostly . 
   it does seem a bit odd if it happened and the police and fire department apparently did n't notice it . 
  they were there as well . 
  you 'd think people would notice . 
  they did n't confirm it happened . 
   makes sense . 
  you 're rationalising people cheering someone to kill himself . 
  there 's not really more to say . 
   if native would end up jobless without education , government would just drop him . 
  no job benefit , if you havent worked before . 
  in germany ? 
   they get so much more than we do , on our expense might i add , what else do they want ? 
  is this not enough ? 
  is this reason to tell someone he should kill himself ? 
   no one questions that honor killings are n't part of german or french culture lol , right . 
   `` ** i feel ** i 'm no longer wanted by 52 % of the voters . '' that 's not a generalisation . 
  i hate this propaganda so much . 
   more than 1.5 million germans , many of them highly educated , left germany during the past decade . -- die welt . 
  yes , most of them students studying abroad and people working abroad that move back to germany afterwards . 
  [ source is the quoted welt article ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article138249483/deutschlands-talente-verlassen-in-scharen-das-land.html )  the statistics do not give a reason why germans are emigrating blatant lie . 
  see above . 
   but anecdotal evidence indicates funny how they only cite right wing anecdotal evidence . 
   germany is facing a spike in migrant crime , including an epidemic of rapes and sexual assaults . 
  mass migration is also accelerating the islamization of germany . 
  many germans appear to be losing hope about the future direction of their country . 
  nope , there is no spike in any of the crime statistics . 
  ( and no source given obviously )  a real estate agent in a town near lake balaton , a popular tourist destination in western hungary , said that 80 % of the germans relocating there cite the migration crisis as the main reason for their desire to leave germany . 
  yes , 80 % of the 5 people that he helped find a new house . 
   it might make negotiations proceed more rapidly ? 
  `` hard brexit it is . 
  now fuck off . '', 
  did he name any other country ? 
  because that looks like he 's trying to appease the home audience . 
   protecting european industry against chinese dumping do n't know , because you believe brexit will revive your industry but block eu measures that would helpt at the same time ? 
  the mayor of the german village garmisch wrote a letter talking about severe problems in the local refugee shelter . 
  foreign media , including russia today and the daily mail cited these problems and declared the village was on the edge of a civil war a single case of sexual insult became various cases of sexual assault . 
  the media declared ` blacks are in charge of town ' even though the letter said no such thing .
