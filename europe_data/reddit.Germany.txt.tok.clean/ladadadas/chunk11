  every born child is counted even tourists afaik . 
  how do you come up with twice or thrice ? 
  ... because far right exremists have killed much more people than islamists in germany . 
  there you go . 
   the national socialist underground or nsu ( german : nationalsozialistischer untergrund ) was a far-right german terrorist group which was uncovered in november 2011 . 
  [ 1 ] so far , the following crimes have been attributed to the nsu : the bosphorus serial murders , a series of murders of nine immigrants ( eight turks and one greek ) between 9 september 2000 and 6 april 2006 ; the murder of a policewoman and attempted murder of her colleague ; the 2001 and 2004 cologne bombings ; and a series of 14 bank robberies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground just last week it turned out that dna of one of the nsu killer was found at the dead body of an 8 year old abducted girl . 
  after her abduction her mother received a far right letter how she is a race traitor for having a husband from turkey . 
  much more people in germany have been killed in the last decades by far right extremists than islamists . 
  the far right is n't vilified as the threat is underestimated . 
  those people are n't `` asking questions '' they are killing people . 
  so you do n't see a problem that people in their late 60s or even 70s still have to work ? 
  because if you 're middle class you do n't have these problems . 
  i have no idea about law so this is about hard for me to explain . 
  he says in a very sarcastic way that the movie is about as realistic regarding the law as armageddon is regarding physics . 
  he explains that it 's good that we do n't have laws that legalise the killing of innocent people because it would create far worse situations . 
  so according to the law there is no doubt that the killing was illegitimate . 
  however the german law has some clause that you can be found not guilty of a crime under certain circumstances ( avert harm ) that may apply to this case . 
  a german law expert wrote a long article why the legal aspects of the movie were bullshit and have nothing to do with the actual laws in germany . 
   generous pensions in europe are also a strong factor in discouraging older people from working , the study said . 
  the bias is strong with this one . 
  there 's a source for all the myths posted :  ** kent now part of france : **  new map of britain that makes kent part of france ' `` for centuries the people of kent have called their county the garden of england . 
  so they might find it quite a surprise that -- according to the european union at least -- they are actually part of france . 
  along with next-door sussex , kent has been rolled in with the calais areas on a map drawn up for brussels . '' ( daily mail , 4 september 2006 , p. 10 )  new eu map makes kent part of same ` nation ' as france ' ( sunday telegraph , 3 september 2006 , p. 9 september 2006 , p. 9 )  brussels plot to wipe britain off the map ' ( the express on sunday , 3 september 2006 , p. 10 )  ` wolf at door ' ( the sun , 4 september 2006 , p. 6 ), 
  most of these are hilarious and i only made it to b from a-z :  bombay mix to be renamed mumbai mix , jul 2006  eu wants to ban bingo callers from using phrases like `` two fat ladies '' , dec 2009  eu law bans church bells , oct 2002  eu bans children from blowing up balloons , oct 2011  bagpipes to be quietened by an edict from brussels , apr 2008  kilts to be classified as women 's wear , november 2003  eu to ban our beaches , april 2014, 
   `` the uk is an important market for us , but the eu market is much more important , '' he said . 
  `` if the eu were to fall apart , that would be a lot worse for our industry . '', 
  i have no idea about other countries but there are 300 000 flats in berlin in the public hand ( http://inberlinwohnen.de/bestand/ ) ranking from very cheap housing to rather luxerious flats . 
  people from all social classes live in these flats . 
  we have yet to see them become a `` symbol of social decay '' after several decades . 
  also you try to imply a causation between public houses and ghettoization which is something you just ca n't do like that . 
  ( you 're more likely seeing a correlation between very cheap housing and crimes/decay )  that is why many people are against mass social housing projects . 
  many people where ? 
  surley not in berlin and pretty sure not in germany . 
  renovation in that context is just an euphemism for creating luxury flats that the current tenants ca n't afford . 
  also how is the money wasted when the market price is way higher than the 3.7 m and the building becomes common property ? 
  people will obviously still pay rents . 
   last summer , the residents of wrangelstrasse 66 , an apartment block in the trendy berlin district of kreuzberg , received an alarming letter from the owner . 
  the whole house was to be sold to a luxembourg-registered company called riva residential . 
  the tenants had two choices : either buy their flats themselves or face an expensive renovation and higher rents . 
   in desperation , they appealed to their local council for help -- and got lucky . 
  councillors discovered an obscure legal tool known as a `` pre-emptive right of purchase '' that allows them to swoop in and stop buildings from being flogged off to private investors . 
  they bought the house for $ 3.7 m and sold it on to a state-owned housing company . 
  wrangelstrasse 66 is now in public ownership and its tenants can stay . 
  this is great even though people will cry about socialism . 
  the discussion in / r/sanfrancisco :  making a building publicly-owned is almost sure to turn it into a slum in the long run wat  what germany is doing sounds awfully soviet-like ... 
  well this is one way to end one a terror list . 
  what about on-tariff barriers to trade ? 
  if brexit happens without even a free trade agreement the eu is going to get a broken nose and some major bleeding . 
  the uk is going to lose about one arm and one leg though . 
  brexit poll dec 14 , 2015 : 58 % remain , 32 % leave . 
  there was some article written by some german professor who said it 's not that unlikely that the uk will just withdraw article 50 if they realise they do n't anything close what they want and who a hard brexit will fuck things up . 
  they would justify that by saying it 's just not the best time right now for brexit . 
  the horrifying thing is that they could do that again and again . 
  activate article 50 , withdraw article 50 . 
  she 's probably going to hold the referendum at the time brexit is going to hurt most . 
  not a bad strategy . 
  source ? 
  ( you probably mean the rightwing hoax that was posted on / r/the _ donald yesterday ), 
  he could have given us information about the recruiting process , possible contacts , their logistics and various other important things . 
  if this is good news for you , you might have some friends in syria/iraq that feel relieved today too . 
  ... hopefully . 
   basically if the eu had allowed this then the uk would have stayed imo . 
  they did allow you that about one week before the referendum . 
  i believe germany actually started the process for the law after this decision . 
  [ 14.06.16 : uk can refuse benefits to unemployed eu migrants , judges rule ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/14/uk-can-refuse-benefits-to-unemployed-eu-migrants-judges-rule ) that was decided before the referendum but nobody in the uk seem to have really cared about it . 
  this is n't as black and white as it seems . 
  the german article says that many of those receiving benefits are actually employed but their salary is considered too low to meet the household income requirements for a decent life . 
  so people can be working and on social benefits . 
  that 's a bit sad actually . 
  so you have proposed what the article is all about ? 
  sorry , that was to obvious to me . 
  eu-nationals will not receive social benefits and have to go home . 
  so you deny fundamentally that the refugee status exist and everybody should go home . 
  that actually is revolutionary . 
  eu social welfare receivers in germany by home country in 2014 : * 1 . 
  poland : 69626 * 2 . 
  italy : 62660 * 3 . 
  greece : 38870 * 4 . 
  bulgaria : 20001 * 5 . 
  so people that have never paid something into the social system should not receive money and starve/steal ? 
  no we do n't . 
  my point was more that the system is so broken that banks are n't even prosecuted when they launder money for terrorists . 
   criminals need to be punished . 
  this does n't apply to banks anymore . 
  uber innovation ( with regard to german law ) : - because you need a commercial insurance when you drive people around commercially uber just told its drivers to not tell anyone that they drive for uber including the tax authority . 
  ( great strategy ) - the contract the driver signs with uber is written in a way that in case of an accident uber can basically just say fuck it which means you 're going to be ruined for life because your insurance is n't going to pay either . 
  [ german source ] ( http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2014-09/uber-nutzer-versicherungen/seite-2 ) uber is a parasite in the form of a shiny app . 
  their change and innovation mostly applies to criminal behaviour .

   an internal ministry report had concluded that the autopilot function represents `` a considerable danger for traffic '' , especially because the driver is not warned when the autopilot system is not able to handle a situation . 
  how is that ignorance ?
