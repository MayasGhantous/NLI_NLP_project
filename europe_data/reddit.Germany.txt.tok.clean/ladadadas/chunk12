   when the boy 's father , who is originally from liberia , opened the door the men , aged 47 and 63 , immediately attacked him , using a baton and a knuckle duster . 
   the boy 's mother was also in the house at the time and attempted to protect her husband , but also ended up being assaulted . 
   mother and son were taken to hospital where they were treated for bruising . 
  the child had sustained injuries to his head . 
   the father was treated at the scene of the crime . 
   police have arrested the two men and are investigating whether there was a racist motive to the crime . 
   according to die welt , the men shouted racist insults during the attack . 
  they live on the same street as their victims , but are not believed to have known them personally . 
  i get defensive because i call out your bullshit ? 
  what exactly has attacking 5 year olds to do with `` my people '' ( mom , we 're on reddit !, 
  ) , `` underprivileged '' and other buzzwords you picked up . 
  the city is n't on lockdown a small part of it is . 
   the national socialist underground or nsu ( german : nationalsozialistischer untergrund ) was a far-right german terrorist group which was uncovered in november 2011 . 
  ** so far , the following crimes have been attributed to the nsu : the bosphorus serial murders , a series of murders of nine immigrants ( eight turks and one greek ) between 9 september 2000 and 6 april 2006 ; the murder of a policewoman and attempted murder of her colleague ; the 2001 and 2004 cologne bombings ; and a series of 14 bank robberies . 
  ** [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground ) but obviously left wing terorrism is far worse . 
  ( last time the raf killed someone was in 1993 ), 
   yeah , thing is if you get threatened by a muslim invader , your police would just tell you not to mess with them yes , they tell you that because hitting 5 year old `` muslim invaders '' makes you nothing else than criminal scum . 
  no no , it 's different . 
  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/it8zo1bq2qu/maxresdefault.jpg he does n't look like he would do that at all . 
   they were begging us to stay jesus , the disillusion .

  yes , foreigners of all sorts have a higher crime rate than locals too . 
  however you can not say romanians in germany are criminals when the overall majority are decent people . 
  that 's why we should n't stereotype entire nations but look at individuals . 
  oh , come on talking about your fellow citizens like that is just sad . 
  it seems like half of the local hospital staff consits of romanians . 
  so i do n't think they 're a burden . 
  you should be sad that these educated people leave your country . 
  all the romians i know are doctors working in the hospital romanians are among the foreigners in germany that integrate the best into the job market . 
  [ source in german ] ( https://mediendienst-integration.de/artikel/ein-jahr-volle-freizuegigkeit.html ), 
   the number of babies born to romanian women rose by 47 percent in 2015 ( to 8,154 , compared to 5,551 in 2014 ) so the romanians should leave ? 
  german supreme court will decide that next week . 
   merkel various times : multiculturalism is dead and a failed ideology it 's not only her view on marriage . 
  merkel has all sorts of conservative views . 
  she 's all but not liberal . 
  to be honest that 's a bit unfair . 
  they have a strong christian social ( compassion and all ) wing too . 
  it 's mostly populism that you hear from them but they are more complex than that . 
  but what proposal came from the uk besides exaggerated ( in my opinion ) calls to get rid of freedom of movement ? 
  what david cameron demanded always looked more like a show for the home audience than an actual reform . 
  the eu was used as a useful scapegoat for politicans and in the end cameron 's bet backfired . 
  also there are/were ways to restrict migration : during the eu enlargement germany ( and other countries as far as i know ) restricted freedom of movement in the early years . 
  the uk did n't . 
  [ germany 's labor minister has drafted a bill which seeks to cut social benefits for foreigners from other eu countries . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/german-minister-proposes-law-to-limit-social-benefits-for-eu-foreigners/a-19221812 ) there are legal ways to restrict eu immigrants from receiving money which is obivously a good thing . 
  why did n't cameron do somethting like that instead of securing his election with the promised referendum . 
  in my opinion incompetent/unwilling uk politicans are more to blame for brexit than anyone else . 
  because bending a pilar is different from getting rid of it altogether .

  i do n't think that takes into account combined power heat plants ( chp ) . 
  the heat produced in a large sacale plant can be used for heating . 
  the heat in a car is mostly wasted . 
  an honest calculation is pretty complicated . 
  ( production of the cars + batteries , second use for batteries in storage systems , potential load shifting ), 
  thank you ireland for supporting the reunification and paving the way :  ireland 's taoiseach , charles haughey supported german reunification and he took advantage of ireland 's presidency of the european economic community by calling for an extraordinary european summit in dublin in april 1990 to calm fears held by fellow members of the eec . 
  haughey saw similarities between ireland and germany and cited `` i have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two german states for unification '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_reunification, 
  the most conservative german state bavaria managed to give 20 000 refugees jobs ( mostly unskilled labour but still tax paying ) and 20 000 a apprenticeship just this year . 
  and that was driven by a initiative of companies . 
  so it 's not all that black and white . 
  the atms stopped working for a day much earlier this year too . 
  it was the same it problem . 
  also it happened last week so it is n't really news . 
  but yeah , zero hedge ...

   destroy your culture , destroy the concept of family , make everyone asexual and androgynous and replace your name with . 
  wow , i had no idea popper wrote about these things . 
  wait , he acutally did n't and you 're attacking some strange straw man . 
  unless you have more than 100 000 $ in your account theres 's nothing to worry about in the eu .

  no , soros even increased the monetary and non-monetary benefits because he lost many internet fights on reddit . 
  if you hate all religions fine but do n't single out islam when you can find lots of great quotes in the bible too : burning women :  `` and the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the whore , she profaneth her father : she shall be burnt with fire . '', 
  cut off her hand :  `` when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand , and taketh him by the secrets : then thou shalt cut off her hand , thine eye shall not pity her . '', 
  ( deuteronomy 25:11 -12 ) female inferiority :  `` but i would have you know , that the head of every man is christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of christ is god . '', 
  ( i corinthians 11:3 ) jesus will kill children :  `` behold , i will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds . 
  and i will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and i will give unto every one of you according to your works . '', 
  ( revelation 2:22 -23 ) rape my daughter :  `` behold , here is my daughter a maiden , and his concubine ; them i will bring out now , and humble ye them , and do with them what seemeth good unto you : but unto this man do not so vile a thing . 
  but the men would not hearken to him : so the man took his concubine , and brought her forth unto them ; and they knew her , and abused her all the night until the morning : and when the day began to spring , they let her go . '', 
  ( judges 19:24 -25 ) wives , submit yourselves !, 
   `` wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the lord . 
  for the husband is the head of the wife , even as christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body . 
  therefore as the church is subject unto christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything . '', 
  women shall not speak  `` let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law . 
  and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church . '', 
  ( i corinthians 14:34 -35 ) happy to kill children  `` happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones . '', 
  ( psalms 137:9 , kjv ) so obviously christianity is inherently sexist and backwards too right ? 
  it 's not a wordplay . 
  yes , obviously it was terrorism but shooting soldiers is still different from shooting civilians . 
   which directly contradicts what he said  killed two u.s. airmen maybe you should read first what i said and then read the source . 
  i deliberately said germans in germany . 
  us airmen are n't german . 
  sad ... 
  no german died from islamist terror in germany for decades . 
  yes , islamist terror is a serious problem but it seems like we have something similar to the whole post 9/11 fear right now .

  the only thing they can achieve is that they delay the whole thing until they are gone and everyone is going to be pissed about it . 
  yes , he 's basically the german version of rupert murdoch . 
  fair enough , i was n't reading that part anymore .
