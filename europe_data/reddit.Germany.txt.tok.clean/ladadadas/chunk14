  13 billion / 5500 = 2.3 million $ per employee . 
  i would take that . 
  well that sucks . 
  the opposite : 400 billions if refugees do n't find work . 
  uber told their drivers in germany that they do n't have to pay any taxes if they do n't tell the finance office that they drive for uber . 
  uber is a fucking parasite . 
   given britain 's size , significance , and its long membership of the european union , there will probably be a special status which only bears limited comparison to that of countries that have never belonged to the european union , '' michael roth , germany 's minister of european affairs , said last month . 
  mr. roth 's they still quote the guy that said he was misunderstood with the same quote a month later : `` let me be very clear : out is out . 
  no cherry picking . 
  free movement of labour is indispensable . '', 
  [ auto translated article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.stern.de%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2ffrauke-petry--afd-chefin-haelt-angela-merkel-kinderlosigkeit-vor-7056952.html ), 
   controversial head of the european commission  allegations have circulated  he also went on to blame his unsteady walking on problems with his leg after a serious car accident . 
   mr juncker insisted that the only `` personal problem '' he suffered from is fatigue . 
  what an embarassing smear campaign article even for uk media standards . 
  posting images of internet sites is really ironic yes . 
   the british government has been ordered to pay a convicted terrorist more than # 13,000 because his human rights were `` violated '' during police interviews over a plot to attack london . 
   `` the government [ has not ] demonstrated compelling reasons for restricting his access to legal advice and failing to inform him of his right to remain silent , '' a judgement released on tuesday said . 
   the verdict was agreed by 11 votes to six after lengthy consideration by judges from countries including britain , italy , turkey , spain , macedonia , ukraine and azerbaijan . 
  why is it still `` violated '' in quotation marks when there 's a ruling by the echr ? 
  political correct racists ? 
  because you want to be part of the common market . 
   soon companies will be cheating on battery life and car range instead of fuel economy or emissions . 
  that 's already happening legally . 
  the fuel economy of a hybrid car is calculated in a ridiculous way . 
  that 's how the 918 spyder gets its consumption of 3.0 l/100 km . 
  also legal tricks that work for electric cars : inflate the tyre pressure to nonsafe values to reduce roll resistance during the test , switch off every auxiliary consumer . 
  for electric cars especially the heating system is relevant . 
  it 's always turned off when the range is determined . 
  some of bis behaviour was so ridiculous : i 'm going to the eu and tell them , we are not going to pay the extra # 1.7 billion !, 
  great success !, 
  we do n't have to pay ... this year . 
  next year though we have to pay the entire money . 
  cameron has mastered the art of shovelling his own grave . 
  no , that was my exaggeration . 
   schools in germany situated close to refugee centers that changed dress codes for students , saying `` see-through tops or blouses , short-shorts or miniskirts could lead to misunderstandings thank you for explaining why breibart is retarded . 
  there is no dress code in german schools , so how can it change ? 
  one * single * school principal wrote a letter to parents telling them to tell their children to dress conservatively . 
  parents made it public and the principal was attacked by everyone including his superiors and the media . 
  ( you probably believe the german media ignored it ) breibart article : germany introduces mandatory burkas at school . 
  yes , and if the uk does n't accept free movement everyone loses too . 
  it 's the same argument . 
  you ca n't conclude who will be giving in from that . 
  germany will have to pay more money to the eu . 
  do n't you think that gives even more incentive to get some of that money back from the uk by hard negotiations ? 
  the calculation does n't include payments by the uk for access to the common market yet nor spending cuts or a new calculation system . 
  all over europe ? 
  the cool thing about the brexit is that after all this barking on both sides we will finally see the results . 
  like david davis , the minister for leaving the eu ? 
   `` once the european nations realise that we are not going to budge on control of our borders , they will want to talk , in their own interest . 
   to carry a loaded firearm in public or outdoors ( and for an individual who is a member of the militia carrying a firearm other than his army-issue personal weapons off-duty ) , a person must have a gun carrying permit ( german : waffentragbewilligung ) , which in most cases is issued only to private citizens working in occupations such as security . 
  [ 9 ] it is , however , quite common to see a person serving military service to be en route with his rifle , albeit unloaded . 
  [ 13 ] the issue of such exceptional permits are extremely selective . 
  so you agree , people should n't walk around with guns in public ? 
   i 've heard some comments that were more than a little morbid about future prospects if things do n't improve in 30-40 years . 
  many people will not be able to afford raising kids , might not be able to rely on the government or family to care for them , would be unemployable and own no property . 
  it 's not exactly rosy . 
  then stop going to the doomsday church . 
   the regular people still struggle to pay their bills despite full time jobs and keep getting struck with ever-increasing challenges when it comes to even just maintaining their modest standard of living he was n't talking about the future , he was talking about the current situation . 
  so how do you explain these ? 
  * 81 % of germans are happy or rather happy with their current financial situation . 
  [ source august , 2016 ] ( http://www.financescout24.de/wissen/news/deutsche-mit-finanzieller-situation-zufrieden ) * 50 % of germany believe their financial situtation will improve in the next 12 months .

   this is an update from the german rifle association , an organization that is trying to keep the current gun laws in europe . 
  they do n't want to keep current gun laws , they want to introduce a human right to have guns . 
  independently from the eu gun ban they do n't really seem anywhere impartial . 
  so you say if it 's true it 's okay and already exclude indians implying it 's bullshit . 
  adapting your own comment :  look at this guys post history . 
   he literally posts similar reworked examples and ~ ~ walls of texts ~ ~ * single sentence comments * all over politically active subs pushing an anti ~ ~ russian ~ ~ * muslim/refugee * angle in one way or another . 
   do n't just take my word for it as a self professed shitposter in ~ ~ trumps ~ ~ * soros/clintons * name , at least unlike this guy i shitpost ~ ~ for the lols and rare pepe 's ~ ~ * because i have nothing else to do *  p.s , you post history coupled with those same reworked copy/pastas you place all over politically charged subreddits does indeed have all the hallmarks of a anti ~ ~ russian ~ ~ * refugee/muslim * shill . 
  i 'm pretty sure the eurotunnel has an importance for the uk economy besides the stake in the operator company . 
  that 's like saying a closed panama canal would n't be a problem . 
   cultural genocide and what exactly is that ? 
   it 's a snapshot into the demographic future of germany til the refugees from yugoslawia are still in germany . 
   atlas shrugged is also a great book , and speaks to libertarianism a german magazine called it dollhouse prose for capitalists that can hardly be endured stylistically . 
  the only reason to read it is to better understand americans . 
   a number of european countries are in the process of following the british example such as ? 
  [ here 's an article regarding the french pessimism ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/why-french-are-world-champs-in-pessimism-2179059.html ) i honestly had no idea about that . 
  i mean you 're france . 
  great weather , food and culture . 
  there 's even a german expression : living like god in france . 
   like all unnecessary institutions , the european union impartial author is very impartial, 
  i think the comparison is stupid but it can be compared to the reichstag fire :  the day after the fire hitler asked for and received from president hindenburg the reichstag fire decree , signed into law by hindenburg using article 48 ( state of emergency )  the reichstag fire decree suspended most civil liberties in germany , including habeas corpus , freedom of expression , freedom of the press , the right of free association and public assembly , the secrecy of the post and telephone . 
   the decree was used by the nazis to ban publications not considered `` friendly '' to the nazi cause . 
   despite the fact that marinus van der lubbe claimed to have acted alone in the reichstag fire , hitler , after having obtained his emergency powers , announced that it was the start of a communist plot to take over germany . 
   with communist electoral participation also suppressed ( the communists previously polled 17 % of the vote ) , the nazis were able to increase their share of the vote in the 5 march 1933 , reichstag elections from 33 % to 44 % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichstag_fire#political_consequences, 
  he even told people in the restaurant leave . 
  wew , time to panic !, 
  `` it 's not yet clear if he is a muslim refugee that shouted allah akbhar but maybe he did ! '', 
  uk media . 
  it 's a projection on the basis that there will be 600 thousand refugees this year , 400 thousand next year and 300 thousand each year afterwards . 
  even this year the number of incoming people will be much lower . 
  also just last year germany had a balance surplus of 12.1 billion $ . 
   fight for anything greater then themselves . 
  like the great adventure in iraq ? 
  the question does n't specify that . 
  because that 's the only possible explanation ?
