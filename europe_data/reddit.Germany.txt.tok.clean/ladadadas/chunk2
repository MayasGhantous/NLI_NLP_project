  many of these crimes are crimes that can not be committed by germans . 
  ( regarding their visa , etc. ),

   1.5 circumventing a previous ban is not allowed . 
  keep this in mind concerning \u00a7 4.2 that probably reduces the number of banned people to a dozen or so . 
   2.5 mods reserve the right to remove egregiously low quality content under limited circumstances people here post youtube videos with no description whatsoever and then cry censorship when it is removed . 
   merkel ca n't on the one hand say that immigrants have to assimiliate and then persue a policy which undercuts that stated aim . 
  germany will spend between 1.8 and 3.3 billion euro for integration and language courses next year . 
  please explain , what undercuts that stated aim ? 
  [ source ] ( http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article145900160/so-teuer-wird-der-fluechtlingsstrom-fuer-deutschland.html )  chinese/east asian immigrants do n't typically need social conditioning to adapt into western societies . 
  source that the chinese overlords do n't need immigration seminars or language courses ? 
   ignoring statistics on broad population sets here is the statistic i have posted : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k1yne/in_2010_merkel_denounced_german_multiculturalism/cuu7rmn  now can you please stop being an idiot ? 
  thanks . 
  always a pleasure to have a level-headed argument !, 
  just some data for muslims in germany : 90 % favour democracy 90 % spend their free time with non-muslims too 50 % have have more non-muslim friends than muslim . 
  60 % agree to same-sex marriage in turkey : 12 % agree to same sex marriage http://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/islam-studie-muslime-orientieren-sich-an-hiesigen-werten/11201512.html, 
  yes , it 's obviously not like a fairy tale story and there are problems . 
  but considering that people back than had the same doomsday fears as today it worked out relatively well . 
  just some data for muslims in germany : 90 % favour democracy 90 % spend free time with non-muslims 50 % have have more non-muslim friends than muslim . 
  60 % agree to same-sex marriage in turkey : 12 % agree to same sex marriage that does n't seem too bad . 
  can we get another source like a wordpress blog to further validate this source ? 
  or maybe an article by prisonplanet . 
  edit : oh never mind , the guy in the video is actually a `` journalist '' for prisonplanet and partner of alex jones . 
  reptilian alien conspiracy confirmed . 
   the north rhine-westphalian police ** fears the emergence of lawless spaces ** in urban areas . 
   the duisburg ** police now wants to reinforce its presence on the street and track offenders more consistently . 
  **  a spokesman for the interior ministry in d\u00fcsseldorf said after the incident , ** there are no no-go areas ** in north rhine-westphalia . 
  also from the article : `` the chancellor is basically saying that germany needs immigrants but immigrants need to do something to get into the society . '', 
  the hypocrisy people here want to point out is n't even there . 
  merkel and her government still have the same position as back then . 
  by the way she is also refering to the time when germany invited people from turkey and italy to work here . 
  `` unfortunately '' these people never left and boy have they changed our society to the negative . 
  the people from turkey created the d\u00f6ner which people here now seem to prefer to traditional food with christian european cultural roots . 
  and they even started their own companies giving us ugly killer games like crysis and far cry instead of another euro truck/farming simulator . 
  and the lazy people from southern italy are hard working and have been integrated so well that you ca n't even spot them which makes it quite hard to pick on them . 
  with your comment you basically just proved what the guy was trying to say with his post . 
  no argument whatsoever just stupidity . 
  quality of posts is bad =  hurr durr disneyland also you may have noticed that the post does n't argue against the immigration posts but the quality of comments and bipartisanship . 
  [ auto translated article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fausland%2fkommentar-orban-setzt-auf-eskalation-a-1051373.html ), 
  great argument . 
  that 's the reasoned analysis / r/europe needs . 
  there are direct quotes in the article . 
  so why not talk about them instead of rt ? 
  i was trying to find that out and it seems like their data is only includes the numbers until 2014 . 
  so the current numbers are n't included . 
  you can find current numbers here ( i do n't find the ones for europe though ) : http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php, 
  yes , that 's true and i do n't question that there are more men coming to europe . 
  but that 's probably because their journey to europe is n't that easy . 
  but i still found it surprising how similar the man to female ratio is . 
  [ muslim countries are the destination for the majority of syrian refugees ] ( https://imgur.com/xslufqc ) . 
  happy ? 
  and while we 're at it : [ here ] ( https://imgur.com/ic2s5ca ) is the demography of all registered syrian refugees . 
  fair enough . 
  why is a post about refugees getting downvoted ? 
  oh , it does n't sound dystopian . 
  at this point / r/europe is nothing but a joke . 
  today the highest upvoted comment in a thread said that `` race war will come and there will be blood flowing through the streets '' while another upvoted comment said he and his friends will happily kill people . 
  and here we go again with `` war is inevitable '' and other funny conspiracies . 
  you know this sub has gone to shit when the actual stomfront site has more moderation and higher standards for comments than / r/europe . 
  at the current trend it will take some more weeks until people here start blaming the joos and reptilian aliens for the refugee crisis . 
  in which bubble do you live ? 
  luckily there is a poll for that too . 
  the result : 34 % germany should take as many refugees as they do now . 
  23 % germany should take more refugees . 
  17 % germany shoould take fewer refugees . 
  38 % no opinion whatsoever . 
  lol , what about all the germans who welcome the refugees and spend their free time helping them . 
  or the latest poll that show 60 % of germans believe we can cope with the current amount of refugees . 
  that 's a 6 % increase in 4 weeks of burning refugee shelters by the way . 
  but that does n't makes as much noise as attacking asylum homes . 
  as far as i can tell i have n't proposed killing people with `` my friends '' . 
  germany just sentenced a man to a 4800 $ fine for proposing about the same . 
  which country are you from again ? 
  and yet you do n't even have the balls to post this on your main account . 
  what a badass you are !, 
  as you said merkel speaks for germany . 
  regarding hungary she has just said that the european law still applies and other countries should respect that . 
  there 's a direct quote in the article i have posted . 
  the german government has also rejected the hungarian view that germany 's `` compliant behaviour '' justifies sending the refugees to us . 
  as long as hungary does n't respect european law they should n't receive any money from german tax payers to help with their `` refugee crisis '' because they end up in germany and austria anyway . 
  anette groth does n't speak for nor represents the german government . 
  she is as crazy as it gets and many people in her own far left party share that view . 
  it 's like using some hungarian politician from a fringe party and say he represents the country . 
  what is it with you people that you are so obsessed with cuckolds ? 
  is it some weird sexual desire that units you ? 
  and how grateful hungary is by sending refugees to germany and austria . 
  i mean greece is in its deepest crisis since the persian invasion and they still manage to have a lower suicide rate than germany . 
  teach us master !, 
  we should create an european exchange system where the southern europeans teach us how to actually enjoy life and we teach them how to run an economy . 
  hopefully these things are n't as mutually exclusive as they appear to be . 
  yeah , your favourite sub / r/european is definitely not an echo chamber or a hugbox . 
  and strange how people from / r/european always come here when people complain about the current state of / r/europe . 
  syria has been at war for 50 years ? 
  that 's nothing but slander !, 
  we did n't won the world cup by corrupt deals with corporations . 
  we won the world cup because one of our satirical magazines offered cuckoo clocks and black forest ham to some of the delegates . 
  one of them then strangely did n't attend the vote and the world cup went to germany instead of south africa . 
  quick , let 's spam an entire sub that is n't called / r/refugeecrisis . 
  if the situation is like that in france it should obiusvly change . 
  i just believe that uber with its business `` strategy '' is n't really the right company for that .
