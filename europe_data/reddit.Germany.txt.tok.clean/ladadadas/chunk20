  right now most of the natural gas used in germany comes from russia by pipeline . 
  an lng terminal would sideline that . 
  germany does n't have an lng terminal . 
  but thanks to putin there 's an increasing interest due to strategic reasons . 
  again he talks about community jobs . 
  is there some sort of black market for picking up trash und removing graffiti ? 
  that 's not what the guy wants . 
  as far as i know he says that there is all sorts of work for refugees . 
  picking up trash etc. 
  what they could do . 
  also he explicitly denies lowering the minimum wage . 
  so how exactly would uneducated , illiterate men drive down the wage ? 
  i do n't understand why put a meaning into that that you ca n't back up . 
  literally from their homepage why they protest :  `` refugees are being attacked and defamed as terrorists , even though it is ter ror from which they themselves are fleeing . 
  people with different skin colours and religions , but also lesbians , homosexuals , transgender people , helpers as both fulltime employees and volunteers , and politicians are being insulted and harassed in germany . 
  europe is closing its borders . 
  social solidarity and the fundamental values of democracy are being put to the test . '', 
  what they are calling to : * to stand up for an open society -- do n't give in to hate and prejudice * to stand up to racism and hate speeches peacefully but decidedly * to protect refugees or anyone who is threatened by racist agitation or attacks * to develop and implement effective protection concepts for women , children , homosexuals , lesbians and transsexuals * to fight the reasons that cause people to flee their home countries * to stop arms exports to areas of conflict * to provide greater support to full-time employees and volunteers in the valuable work they do * to encourage participation and integration . 
  everyone has the right to live a life fit for a human being , to have affordable accommodation and access to education and work [ source ] ( http://hand-in-hand-gegen-rassismus.de/fileadmin/download/dokumente/handinhandagainstracism_june19.pdf ) i mean most points do n't sound to stupid do n't they ? 
  fighting reasons why people flee for instance . 
  you are only asking rhetorical questions and are n't interested in actual answers ? 
  there is no actual hate crime legislation in germany . 
  ( unlike hate speech ) however motives can be taken into account when determining the punishment . 
  burning down your empty house for insurance money is different from throwing molotow cocktails at a refugee shelter with people inside . 
  ... therefore racism is not an issue ? 
  why did 9/11 happen ? 
  i thought terrorism is illegal in the us . 
  not a single german soldier has been sentenced to death for refusing to participate in war crimes . 
  most were n't even punished at all and and actual punishment could be something like : less free time or no promotion . 
  [ source in german ] ( http://www.welt.de/kultur/kino/article124056600/niemand-musste-bei-erschiessungen-mitmachen.html ) can you say the same about those jews you talk about mr. / r/nationalsocialsm ? 
  wether he is actually able to serve time in jail is another question that will be answered by doctors . 
  the sentence is done independently from that . 
   he 's no threat to society neither were most of the high ranking ss and gestpo officers . 
  they were lovely family men integrated into society . 
  that 's part of the banality . 
  for example in early auschwitz trails neighbours and mayors gave testimony that the culprits could never have done anything evil . 
  also it should be noted that these trails happen that late because right after the war nobody ( germans + allies ) was really intrested in actual disclosure . 
  many `` honest men '' were needed to rebuild the security machine and fight against the communists . 
  ( or become part of them in the gdr ) some of the still very famous and admired panzer generals were able to literally right history by publishing books about their honest war among gentleman . 
  even historics took these stories as the truth for a long time . 
  you smell like an idiot . 
  the moonlanding thing too ? 
  this thread is a fucking shit show . 
  like the kkk ones in the us ? 
  okay , that does n't sound as extreme as before . 
   if you are a muslim you can move to mekka so all christians in muslim countries can always move to the vatican ? 
  i heard that reasoning before but do n't understand it . 
  in absolute numbers yes the eu would lose much more . 
  but 45 % is still much more of an existential threat to an economy than 15 % . 
  standardised polar bear family size incoming . 
  there was a pretty thorough analysis in a german magazine regarding the post brexit strategy preferred by germany and the eu commission with interviews and all . 
  basically germany and the eu would treat the uk like any other country . 
  no hard feelings but also no special discount or stuff . 
  that was said to be scarring enough for the uk . 
  the uk exports about 45 % to the eu , the eu 15 % to the uk . 
  and you honestly believe french and german exporters will have to pressure anyone ? 
  of course there will be some form of free trade . 
  but obviously it will be a more beneficial agreement for the eu . 
  even better/worse every single eu country has to agree to it . 
  so what will happen to countries that will get some of the former uk export share ? 
  they would want to keep that . 
  what do you believe will happen to your negotiating power if banks relocate to say the netherlands ? 
  will they say `` alright let 's give the uk access to the entire market again '' ? 
  and again it takes a single country to block any free trade agreement . 
  today that 's about as likely as sch\u00e4uble becoming prime minister and merkel replacing the queen . 
  it 's funny how they call \u00d6zdemir a traitor considering he renounced his turkish citizenship as a juvenile and insists being of swabian and german culture . 
   the uk has always been the most resistant to the european project , why ? 
  the uk was the only european country to have a fully functioning parliamentary democracy for at least a hundred years prior to the second world war . 
  spain , germany , eastern europe , southern europe -- what do they all have in common prior ? 
  all of them either come from fascism , military dictatorship or communism . 
  ** it 's not that they do n't want a democracy , it 's that they 've never experienced a true democracy . 
  the eu is as good as it gets for them ** -- to them , it must be the blueprint of what democracy somehow is because they do n't know any better . 
  it 's great that someone from a country that [ did that to people that wanted to be free from your great democracy ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/vereshchagin-blowing_from_guns_in_british_india.jpg ) ( actually being considered subhuman ) tries lecture others about history and democracy from moral higher ground . 
  not to mention how you ignore great nations like france . 
  ( yes , i actually made it that far reading the comment ), 
  yes , i do n't deny that . 
  i do n't know where this statistics is from but it 's not true . 
  the bka has analyzed which foreigners and refugees commit most crimes by their home country just recently . 
  [ highest rates are among the maghreb states , former yugoslawia and georgia . 
  ] ( http://img.welt.de/img/ausland/crop156079010/2870198183-ci3x2l-w780/dwo-ap-fluechtlinge-kriminell-01.jpg ) source is a study from 2016 , not 2014 . 
  it 's not a random tabloid it 's the german fbi ( called bka ) that reported crimes commited by people from georgia are skyrocketing in germany . 
  [ here are the numbers of crimes commited by people from georgia for a single german state by the state office of criminal investigation ] ( http://www.swr.de/-/id=15650908/property=gallery/pubversion=1/width=648/hgdqtw/straftaten%20von%20georgischen%20staatsb%c3%bcrgern%20in%20rheinland-pfalz.jpg ) organized crime is sending teams to germany to steal and commit crimes calculating that they can do so for a while until they are deported . 
  the bka has analyzed what foreigners and refugees commit most crimes by their home country . 
  [ highest rates are among the maghreb states , former yugoslawia and georgia . 
   who can receive citizenship quicker than a legal immigrant if they get asylum . 
  ( in germany at least ) go ahead and show some proof for that . 
  there wo n't be a recall . 
  if the eu states do n't find a consent ( which they did n't ) the commission itself can do the decision which they will before the licence runs out end of june . 
  the most likely scenario for that is a provisional admission for 12 to 18 month . 
  however individual states are free to ban glyphosate anyway which can happen with france but wo n't happen in germany because the two governing parties are undecided on the issue . 
  it 's going to be a severe case of `` the eu is forcing us ! '', 
  even though sovereignty still applies . 
  countries that voted against a new approval or by abstinence are said to be france , portugal , italy , austria , germany , sweden and luxembourg . 
  also this is mostly not about an absolute ban and more about introducing stricter rules . 
  for example `` sikkation '' ( do n't know if that 's english ) is not banned unlike other countries like switzerland . 
  that means potato plants are sprayed with glyphosate just before harvest to kill the plant and make the harvest easier . 
  same applies for winter barley . 
  basically it can only be either aliens or [ jews ] ( http://imgur.com/6oos5yy ) . 
  [ english source ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/a-group-in-germany-conspiring-against-turkey-says-erdogan.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=100071&amp;newscatid=338 ), 
  in the latest poll ( different institute though ) they went down to 10 % .
