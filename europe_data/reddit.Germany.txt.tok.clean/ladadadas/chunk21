  that was even before the whole boateng thing . 
  there was a discussion about the safety of the maghreb states . 
  some politician noted that they throw homosexuals into prison . 
  gauland then noted that we should do that too in germany . 
  the afd now back paddles and says no no no we only want to prevent homosexuals from living out their degeneracy in public not put them into prison !, 
  the big irony is how much the afd has in common with islamists regarding social values . 
  nobody was arrested . 
  the attorney general started a investigation and had to resign for it . 
  also the government can not arrest people . 
  yes , the politically correct german media that did n't report on the russian girl gang raped by 30 refugees in germany . 
  oh wait that did n't actually happen . 
  russia made it up and even their foreign minister accused germany of a cover up . 
  you can still find the russia today articles where redditors circlejerked that the political correct media ( and merkel obviously ! ), 
  is covering it up . 
  and it does n't even end with the internet . 
  russian immigrants used the whole story to threaten refugees they accused of the rape . 
  many turks ( not saying all ) have become fully integrated in our society . 
  you will find them in all jobs from blue collar to management positions which somewhat changed the perspective of people . 
  however even among these turks ( born and raised in germany ) nationalism is pretty common which is somewhat strange . 
  nowadays people mostly hate people from north africa due to lots of criminality . 
  also it 's funny how it changes over the years . 
  during the eastward enlargement of the eu everyone was afraid of gangs from poland coming to steal - everything - from germany . 
  opening the border was said to be the end of our property . 
  like japan then ? 
  infowars is that you ? 
  no they do n't know that and believe they represent the majority . 
  in the interview he even says that the german people would not want `` someone like boateng as a neighbor '' . 
  in the long run it 's great that they get some airtime for their stupidity so people see how they really think . 
  even for most dimwits it 's a step to far insulting our national team . 
  just bevor the european championship nonetheless . 
  ermahgerd naked people !, 
  `` nothing is holy to them !, 
  is that a joke ? 
  can you really buy that ? '', 
  nobody could even tell klose and podolski have polish roots . 
  they speak perfectly german ( podolski in a funny lower class way ) and pegida seems to only care about skin colour . 
  the entire notion that pegida consists of concerned citizens only worried about islamization and vilified by the media is falling apart . 
  there 's a picture of the entire national team by the way . 
  yet they ca n't even stand pictures of non-whites born and raised in germany . 
  experience with other systems for example . 
  which system would you prefer ? 
  `` my candidate lost so democracy sucks . '', 
  yeah , people do n't even acknowledge how advanced our broomstick technology is . 
  because [ putin speaks fluently german ] ( https://youtu.be/2frvopgwxf0?t=2m42s ) and noone who speaks german could be an evil man . 
  freedom of speech ? 
  it 's one thing to be ignorant . 
  it 's a different thing to be proud about it . 
  so why does n't the us decrease their 3.5 % defense spending to the nato goal of 2 % ? 
  needs more soros . 
  yes , it 's really disgusting to test 48 10 to 14 year olds and call it the national average of equatorial guinea . 
   then there were some dubious results , in africa particularly this is based on the infamous book by richard lynn and tatu vanhanen which is not taken serious at at all . 
   susan barnett and wendy williams wrote that `` we see an edifice built on layer upon layer of ** arbitrary assumptions ** and ** selective data manipulation ** . 
   '' ** disregarding scientific objectivity ** '' , '' ** misrepresenting data ** ''  for 104 of the 185 nations , no studies were available . 
  in those cases , the authors have used an estimated value by taking averages of the iqs of neighboring or comparable nations  to obtain a figure for south africa , the authors averaged iq studies done on different ethnic groups , resulting in a figure of 72 . 
  the figures for colombia , peru , and singapore were arrived at in a similar manner . 
   a ** test of 108 9 - to 15-year-olds ** in barbados , of 50 13 - to 16-year-olds in colombia , of 104 5 - to 17-year-olds in ecuador , of 129 6 - to 12-year-olds in egypt , and of 48 10 - to 14-year-olds in equatorial guinea , all ** were taken as measures of national iq **  the review concludes that `` this is not so much science , then , as a social crusade . '', 
  '' ** the low standards of scholarship evident in the book render it largely irrelevant for modern science ** '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iq_and_the_wealth_of_nations#criticism_of_data_sets, 
  italian prime minister :  `` i love germany so much that i prefer to see two of them '' thatcher :  we defeated the germans twice !, 
  and now they 're back !, 
  thatcher [ ... ] favoured soviet troops staying in east germany as long as possible to act as a counterweight to a united germany . 
  fran\u00e7ois mitterrand :  `` france by no means wants german reunification , although it realises that in the end it is inevitable . '', 
  prime minister of ireland charles haughey :  `` i have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two german states for unification '' gorbachev :  `` the germans must decide for themselves what path they choose to follow '' condoleezza rice :  the united states -- and president george h. w. bush -- recognized that germany had gone through a long democratic transition . 
  it had been a good friend , it was a member of nato . 
  any issues that had existed in 1945 , it seemed perfectly reasonable to lay them to rest . 
  for us , the question was n't should germany unify ? 
  it was how and under what circumstances ? 
  polls also showed that the uk wo n't vote for brexit . 
  things change . 
  no he was n't ? 
  he said :  sweden has high fertility rate because they have so many muslim immigrants with tfr of 3-6 depending fertility in sweden according to your source : muslims 2.5 , non-muslims 1.8 the posted data says sweden has a rate of 1.85 . 
  sweden would still be in the same place with a rate of 1.8 without muslims . 
  what a ridiculous statement . 
  [ sweden has a muslim population of 4.6 % ] ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/these-eu-nations-have-the-largest-muslim-populations/ ) under the assumption that non-muslim swedes have a birth rate of 1.5 , muslims would need to have more than 8 children per women in order to raise the birth rate to 1,85 . 
  there 's * not a single * country in the world with a rate that high . 
  do we now have to counter prove statements ? 
   they laid the bound servant on the ground , stuck a wooden wedge into his mouth , and poured into his belly a bucket full of foul manure water , which they called a swedish drink . 
  parents in germany used to threaten their children that the swedes would come to get them until recently . 
  ww1 ended nearly 100 years ago . 
  not even the most right wing extremists care about the elsass . 
  i would n't even care if the us puts cameras into merkel 's bathroom ( ehhh ) . 
  but with the capabilities of the nsa we have to assume that every electronic communication of every single citizen is stored somewhere in utah . 
  that 's the really evil thing . 
  old europe was used very proudly though . 
  that 's not true . 
  germany had a memorial for a waffen ss division where veterans and their families came together each year . 
  i really wonder if they are too stupid or just do n't care that they 're only going to hurt minimum wage employees . 
  you ignore that the green-lefts gained much more seats than wilders . 
  stop making things up ... http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/25-jahre-mauerfall/interaktiv/article133254520/gebuertige-berliner-und-zugezogene-wer-kam-wer-ging-wer-heute-hier-wohnt.html, 
  refguees are n't immigrants you know that ? 
  or how do you explain that germany [ sent all those refugees back ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/graphics/d27_2bv_d.gif ) after the war in yugoslavia ended . 
  240m is n't even a new production line . 
  all those negative brexit posts are stupid just like these posts are stupid . 
   call anyone who disagrees a nazi ... yeah , sure, 
   donald j. trump : the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability, 
  [ holland is the greatest city in the world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phg7wleyl-y ), 
  it 's more about the mindset though . 
  the first time he was voted to the german bundestag he spent half an hour each evening walking around the offices turning off the light to save energy . 
  combine that with an extrem fetish for garbage sorting and you have a turkey born swabian . 
  in fact he calls himself an antolianan swabian . 
  german politician cem \u00d6zdemir demanded to have the right to campaign in turkey too .
