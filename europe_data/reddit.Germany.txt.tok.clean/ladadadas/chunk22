  it 's pretty funny because erdogan and friends consider him a traitor because he initiated the armenian genoicde resolution because he considers himself swabian instead of turkish and because he 's an atheist . 
  germany should announce erika steinbach as an alternative to tusk .

  this is probably about other emissions like fine dust ( ? ),

   there 's almost no right wing terrorism that is n't following islamic ideology non of the linked attack counters or follows islamic ideology if i understand you correctly . 
  if you take a look at the linked wikipedia site you find much more than 4 cases . 
  left wing terror with actual killings is something of the past in germany , right wing terror not so much . 
  jesus christ , do you even believe yourself what you 're saying ? 
  * breivik , first he bombed several government buildings in oslo , killing eight people and injuring more than 30 . 
  after the bombings , he went to ut\u00f8ya island in a fake police uniform and began firing on people attending a political youth camp for the worker 's youth league ( auf ) , a left-wing political party , ** killing 68 and injuring more than 60 . 
  ** * oktoberfest attack , a ** right-wing terrorist ** attack in munich , germany ** killed the attacker and 14 other people , injuring 215 ** . 
  fears of an ongoing campaign of major right-wing terrorist attacks did not materialize . 
  * german national socialist underground was responsible for the bosphorus serial murders ( 2000 -- 2006 ) , the 2004 cologne bombing and the murder of policewoman mich\u00e9le kiesewetter in 2007 * august 1980 ** bologna bombing , a group of right-wing terrorists ** exploded a bomb at a railroad station in bologna , italy , ** killing 85 people and injuring more than 180 .

  nowhere does it say poles . 
  you can criticize a government without the people . 
  [ here ] ( https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/ ) are the last brexit polls . 
  do you actually understand the margin of error in election polls ? 
  same with the `` hillary has a 90 % '' of winning . 
  those were based on simulations where trump won 1 in 10 simulation runs which is n't that bad . 
  it seems like there 's a positive change though which is something not many countries today can say . 
  corruption is nothing that you can stop over night . 
  that map makes us germans look like the baddies . 
  must be dutch propaganda !, 
  which history book is this based on ? 
  whoops , did you forget that sweden has a different methodology ? 
  the 80/20 rule applies to pretty much anything and any country . 
  you want to be 6 times more likely to have aids ? 
  `` per capita '', 
  everyone can apply as a refugee . 
  american gis did it during the iraq war in germany too . 
   ctrl + f `` rape '' : 39 results, 
  we have already seen `` peak child '' . 
  the world is doing better than this whole panic nonsense is making it seems like  the demographic consequences are amazing . 
  in the last decade the global total number of children aged 0-14 has levelled off at around two billion , and un population experts predict that it is going to stay that way throughout this century . 
  ** that 's right : the amount of children in the world today is the most there will be . 
  ** we have entered into the age of peak child !, 
  the population will continue to grow as the peak child generation grows up and grows old . 
  so most probably three or four billion new adults will be added to the world population - but then in the second half of this century the fast growth of the world population will finally come to an end . 
  income equality is something that needs context . 
  somalia is probably pretty equal too . 
   june 13 , 2007 : about 9,000 iraqis made it to sweden in 2006 - almost half of the 22,000 who sought asylum in the entire industrialized world . 
  this year , when the united states has promised to take in 7,000 iraqis , around 20,000 are expected to seek asylum in sweden .

  beata szydlo was n't that amused about it apparently . 
  that 's obviously wrong because brexit has n't happened yet !, 
  there 's an article/interview in the recent spiegel where he says that brexit and other countries leaving the eu is good for the us because they can negotiate more favourable trade deals with single states instead of the eu . 
  he 's basically proving why the eu is important . 
  ... ... that 's not him . 
  89 % of the population according to reddit . 
  the actual number is 5 % . 
  is it trump because he sold the country to russia ? 
  is it not suprising that only 23 % of those tweets were in german * and * the foreign ones were more hateful ? 
  so the entire law applies in switzerland because of schengen ? 
  that 's actually stupid . 
   how does this impact terrorism when the guns used were already illegal in europe ? 
  the gun used in berlin came from switzerland by the way . 
  huh , so you 're not an altright bot after all . 
  wow , solid argument right here . 
   it has been argued that the parable , while intuitive , may not correspond to actual evidence . 
  for instance , some economists argue that natural disasters can often result in improved growth in both the short and long term . 
  people will just stop going to the doctor ? 
  in the ( for the uk ) best case they just die but most likely they will work as carriers for infections .

   `` there does seem to be strategy behind the bots , '' dr. howard said . 
  `` by the third debate , trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing clinton hashtags . ''  in a previous research paper , dr. howard and bence kollanyi , a researcher at corvinus university of budapest , described how political chatbots had a `` small but strategic role '' in shaping the online conversation during the run-up to the brexit referendum .
