   / r/altright  / r/the _ donald checks out . 
  we should upgrade the romanian dna to a european agency . 
  the same thing happened in germany too with politicans employing family members as drivers or it experts . 
  so he 's just like merkel in that aspect ? 
  france is already the country german politicans trust most on the international stage . 
   lebanon higher than venezuela or mexico ? 
  lebanon is n't exactly like saudi arabia . 
  women there marry at 31 on average and many younger people are pretty open regarding their sexuality . 
  first of all those christians converted to christianity * after * coming to germany . 
  also there seems to be a missunderstanding how these things work . 
  you do n't get bonus points or a german citizenship for whatever religion you have . 
  they are n't considered refugees so they have to leave . 
  but it 's so oversimplified that i do n't see how it 's true anymore . 
  the rise of hitler had many reasons . 
  the economic situation , unemployment , the feeling that germany was fucked over by the treaty of versaille , the `` dagger legend '' ( german soldiers undefeated in ww1 stabbed from behind by jews ) . 
  reducing it to communism vs. german values is just not true . 
  also you make it sound like other parties had no german values . 
  there was kurt schumacher for example , a pretty nationalist social democrat and as prussian as it gets . 
  there were others like him too . 
  ( `` you can take our life and our freedom but never our honor '' ) and then again you make it sound like hitler represented german values . 
  he certainly did that with things like militarism but he also betrayed many other values germany was famous for like science ( no more jewish phyiscs ) , literature ( most of the most famous authors left germany ) and art ( degenerated art ) . 
   hitler rose to power over german values vs communist values yeah , no . 
  i was only arguing your point that `` economics is a zero sum game '' . 
  that 's just a pretty outdated view of economics after adam smith . 
  not even marx thought of it that way as far as i know . 
  the simple math is what for you ? 
  country a is very good at producing cars , country b is very good at producing computers . 
  country a gets computers and country b gets cars by trading which increases the utility of both sides * and * they can focus on what they 're good at . 
   economics is a zero sum game are you a time traveller from the 18th century ? 
  the idea that economics is a zero sum game basically brings you back to the age of mercantilism . 
   there 's an old school of though that adam smith addressed , going way back when he wrote `` the wealth of nations '' in 1776 , called mercantilism , which views trade as a zero-sum game : a country can gain by exporting but loses when it imports . 
  and what adam smith showed is that that 's not correct , that trade is a positive-sum game . 
  both countries can gain from both exporting and importing . 
   imports are good for an economy : they help consumers , they lower prices , they increase variety . 
  they provide necessary inputs for firms in their production process and allow for more specializes inputs that help their productivity . 
   so adam smith really changed the presumption in thinking that countries can specialize in certain types of goods that they 'll export . 
  and with those exports they can afford to buy imports that other countries will specialize in . 
  and therefore a 180 degree turn ( ! ), 
  in how we cope and remember the past is needed ? 
  german media said he promised to visit germany as a tourist . 
  as an american he should probably start to put a canadian flag on his backpack again . 
  you can get an idea how europeans think about nato from these polls : http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/06/support-for-nato-is-widespread-among-member-nations/, 
  so for you a chihuahua is a proud wolf ? 
  ironically it seems like mostly chihuahuas are so obsessed with stables and horses . 
   extremist ... worships karl popper . 
  i just ca n't take you serious after that . 
  but you 're the one that convinced the entire world that charlemagne is french !, 
  prussia opened its borders for huguenot refugees from france . 
  frederick the great even offered bo build mosques if muslims would like to settle in prussia . 
  afd today would call prussia a leftist country . 
   extreme left . 
  yes , that 's why she 's against gay marriage . 
  first time she ran for office she wanted to implement : * flat tax * privatization of the social system * closer ties with george w. away from france * she even went to the us to fucking apologize that germany did n't participate in the great adventure in iraq germany would be more murican than murica today if she would have won . 
   she 's a lifetime politician , wow , so she did a phd in physical chemistry * and * worked as a researcher for 12 years in her free time . 
  pretty impressive . 
  trump could be the biggest contributor to the european project since freude sch\u00f6ner g\u00f6tterfunken after all . 
  a truly unified europe that speaks and negotiates with one voice in the world is n't in the interest of the us . 
  ( and why would it be )  the eu and us : from cooperation to rivalry [ source , 2007 ] ( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0703633042000197780?journalcode=geui20 )  the united states and the european union ( eu ) have engaged in a friendly economic rivalry for decades . 
  [ source , 2015 ] ( http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/is-europe-outperforming-the-united-states/ ), 
  skoda mostly uses components that are one car generation behind vw and audi . 
  that 's pretty genius because vw and audi cars are basically one giant long term quality test for skoda which improves the quality . 
  you most be really convinced by your opinion considering you created a new account for that . 
  the journalist who did the interview says it was the strangest interview he ever did . 
  apparently trump does n't know who jean-claude juncker is . 
  this fucking orange fucker .

  hopefully the leaders of san escobar are n't cyclists or vegetarians . 
  there 's a nasty video of you circling around that could become public any time . 
  obviously we have nothing to do with it but we could stop those criminals from publishing it . 
  even further , we would try to help a great man like you to become president of the united states . 
  would n't that be great ? 
  the only thing we ask from you as president is that you do n't forget your russian friends . '', 
  russian plomo o plata .

   in 1983 , a book by geochemist jerome nriagu called lead and lead poisoning in antiquity laid out the basics of the theory . 
  there was an immediate backlash from classicists , who pointed out that not all roman pipes were made of lead -- many were ceramic or stone . 
  scientists also jumped in to pick apart nriagu 's theory , using skeletal evidence to show that romans actually had less accumulated lead in their bones than modern europeans .
