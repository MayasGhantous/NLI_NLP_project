  it 's also been argued that roman drinking water was unlikely to have absorbed much lead even from lead pipes , due both to the speed at which the water traveled and the buildup of minerals inside the pipes , which would have created an insulating layer . 
  that 's a myth like half the facts in this thread . 
   tap water from ancient rome likely contained up to 100 times more lead than local spring water , the team reports online today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences . 
  while the lead contamination was measureable , the team says the levels were unlikely high enough to be harmful , ruling out tap water as a major culprit in rome 's demise . 
  so because of freedom of speech you demand that they draw mohammed ? 
  team vercingetorix , team arminius !, 
  oh god , this is like a mine field . 
   wer zur gewalt aufrufe , genie\u00dfe nicht den schutz der religionsfreiheit `` if you call for violence , freedom of religion does n't protect you '' i do n't think that 's populism or racism . 
  germany has a similar stance against scientology for example . 
  when you have foreign imams preaching hate and violence they have to leave . 
  okay , that makes it a bit clearer . 
  i just honestly do n't think anyone was implying that it was legal or trying to make you culturally russian . 
  but even in germany itself people still talk about the `` former gdr '' or our `` newly-formed german states . 
  it 's not meant in a condescending way and it seems like the whole `` eastern europe '' vs. `` central europe '' discussion again . 
  it does n't diminish the problem nor does it mean that we do n't have to fight terrorism . 
  fear is the end goal of terrorism so it seems like a good thing it 's not working on most germans . 
   do n't you ever wonder why some narratives are pushed ? 
  who would ever really say this with dead people as the cause ? 
  only a madman with an objective . 
  yes , but i see that even more on the other side . 
  politicians and the media calling for new laws that would take away freedom from * all * people . 
  the berlin attacker was known for trying to buy an automatic rifle , he was known for volunteering for a suicide attack . 
  but nothing happened . 
  those are the things that should be discussed . 
  our politicans are more worried that veggie sausage might unsettle customers . 
  yes , that 's why the gdr still exists . 
  people there do n't have any mistrust in their leaders . 
  because the same thing was posted here yesterday .

  big if true . 
  they have a pretty good relationship and egypt even recognizes israel :  in 2012 , the muslim brotherhood declared their support for the peace treaty , [ 30 ] [ 31 ] and israeli prime minister benyamin netanyahu affirmed he had no problem dealing with the muslim brotherhood so long as the peace treaty was respected . 
  [ 32 ] post mubarak , the egyptian authorities continued to protect an idf memorial in the sinai in keeping with their treaty obligations . 
  [ 33 ] the israelis remained positive about the treaty after mb candidate mohammed morsi was elected president in june 2012 . 
  [ 34 ]  egypt 's post-mubarak rulers were instrumental in mediating between hamas and israel for the gilad shalit prisoner exchange that led to the liberation of israeli soldier gilad shalit in exchange for 1,027 palestinian prisoners between october and december 2011 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egypt%e2%80%93israel_relations, 
  there was an article in a german newspaper about the most beautiful words in the world . 
  saudade was among the top 3 or something . 
  time to start a pr campaign in elsass-lothringen . 
  neither of those articles supports any of your claims ? 
   cover-up the ethnicity of criminals source needed . 
  ( i wonder how they came up with the einzelfall map if the police does n't report that ? ), 
   outright does n't report crimes source needed, 
  ah yes , the famous einzelfall map :  ukranian caught on a bicycle on the autobahn http://polizeibericht.com/geisterradler-auf-der-autobahn/ criminal scum !, 
  start world war * 2 . lose world war * 3 .

  sad . 
   he was a nazi collaborator wow , he was 15 at the end of the war and still managed to be an important nazi collaborator . 
  oh wait , that 's bullshit :  the claim that george soros was a nazi collaborator is false and deeply offensive . 
  as a 13-year-old child soros was hidden with an official of the ministry of agriculture . 
  soros 's father helped hide the official 's jewish wife and the official agreed to let young soros pose as his christian godson in return . 
  this is how soros was able to survive the nazi occupation . 
  on one occasion the official went to inventory the estate of a jewish family that had fled hungary under duress . 
  he brought the child in his charge along rather than leaving him alone in budapest . 
  to construe this as soros `` collaborating with nazis '' is false , malicious and deeply misleading http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/11/george-soros-60-minutes/2/, 
  uk media should n't even be up for discussion because it 's so obviously biased . 
   accused of sexual assault at some point in the recent past he was also accused of being a deadly terrorist in the recent past . 
  one news paper mentioned a possible investigation of sexual assault and of course everybody run with it while another report said there was only an investigation for insult . 
   `` cdu politician supports cdu politicians '',

  / r/the _ donald is sub full of top minds that have managed to reveal the conspiracy that germany is trying to conquer the world ( again ) with the help of isis , nato and the eu army :  ii . 
  germany allows isis events to occur to justify occupying europe with the eu army  b. nato arms/vehicles are being used to covertly equip the eu army and did n't merkel ate pizza once too ? 
   the_donald yep , there it is . 
  yes , that 's the only explanation foreigners like you can come up with . 
  it totally could n't be related to the fact that 14 million germans were refugees after ww2 too . 
  often treated like shit . 
  and yet i believe you entirley ban pump guns .

  are people depressed and passive if they still drive a car ? 
  you realise that bulgarians were considered untermenschen too , right ? 
  yes, 
  what 's the allowed quota ? 
  the `` bomb '' he fabricated was only flammable not explosive . 
  so at least there 's that . 
  the police even said that `` defusing '' would be an exaggerated term for what they did with the thing . 
  okay . 
  lying media goes both ways you know . 
   the press lying about the cologne nye source ?
