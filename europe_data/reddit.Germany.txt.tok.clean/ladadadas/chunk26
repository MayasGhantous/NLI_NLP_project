   `` a hero for many '' so is he wrong ? 
  yes , there 's no definition for permanent or substantial . 
  nato even publishes research papers what substantial means . 
  the reason for that is the 1997 nato-russia founding act that excludes `` permanent stationing of substantial combat forces '' in eastern europe . 
  nato still complies with that to show that it 's not threatening russia . 
  that 's also why there 's lots of rotation and a limit on the presence .

   amadeu antonio foundation which is part of a task force policing social media in germany for `` hate speech '' amadeu antonio foundation is part of the task force , that 's true . 
  they do n't do any policing though , that 's wrong . 
  that mixture of true and false statements smells a bit like breitbart . 
  you can find dozens of articles regarding native english speakers that do n't feel the need to integrate in berlin . 
  [ sorry , no german ] ( http://www.exberliner.com/features/lifestyle/sorry-no-german/ )  recently , my german boyfriend and i tried out a new australian place in reuterkiez . 
  not only was the food lousy and overpriced , not one of the staff could speak any german . 
  even the menus were english-only -- i ended up translating practically the whole thing for my boyfriend . 
  when the waitress came over , i asked for `` zwei kaffee , bitte '' . 
  she did n't understand a word , and she was n't even embarrassed . 
  later , i quizzed the owner when she brought us the bill . 
  `` do any of your staff speak german at all ? '' they did n't . 
  oh god , you people are deliberately moving back to the dark ages .

   who decides what 's fake ? 
  fact : a fact is something that has really occurred or is actually true . 
  the usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability . 
  you should n't judge the taz by one article , it 's an intelligent newspaper that looks beyond its left stand . 
  they have pretty intelligent articles regarding islamism for example . 
  okay , then explain your plan how to secure the entire greece coastline ? 
  and no bullshit `` we just use some boats '' . 
  we 're talking about a coastline of 13 676 km .

  not protecting europe from refugees ?

   trump claimed that students gave 98 % favorable reviews to the program . 
  but according to some former students , trump university employees pressured students to offer favorable reviews , told them they had to fill out the forms in order to obtain graduation certificates , a university that works like the mafia . 
  it 's fabulous . 
  yes , russia 's propaganda is quite classy :  case of lisa f.  russian media extensively covered the story and reported that the girl had been mistreated and held as a `` sex slave ''  sergey lavrov , russian foreign minister , accused the german authorities of a tendency `` to paint over reality in a politically correct manner for domestic political reasons . '', 
  the girl had `` clearly not disappeared for 30 hours voluntarily . 
   after the russian media extensively covered the story and reported that the girl had been mistreated and held as a `` sex slave '' , many russian germans reacted with anger ; beginning on 18 january there were demonstrations in several parts of germany , amongst others in front of the bundeskanzleramt in berlin on 23 january . 
  russian foreign minister needs to get involved when a girl runs away because of bad grades .

  yes , christianity and judaism is much better : * the bible 's prophets , and roman emperors married girls as young as 8 * mary got pregnant between the ages of 11 and 14 . 
  * according to the jewish talmud , prophet moses and his followers had sex with girls as young as 3 years old .

   convincing nuclear powers france and britain to provide security guarantees for all of europe . 
  it 's not really more than that . 
  the eu would start paying france and the uk ( probably not post brexit ) for their nukes though . 
  my point is that it 's not up to the us to decide where european countries get their energy from . 
  and i find it highly ironic how those russian sanctions by the us tend to affect m mostly european companies but not american ones . 
  you 're right :  france called the us bill `` unlawful '' due to its `` extraterritorial reach , '' saying it could impact europeans if enacted . 
  `` we have challenged similar texts in the past , '' the foreign ministry said in a statement . 
  `` to protect ourselves against the extraterritorial effects of us legislation , we will have to work on adjusting our french and european laws . '', 
   a number of european officials have suggested the united states is targeting russian energy in part to promote its own liquefied national gas exports to europe . 
  because the native population was n't and is n't affected ? 
  it 's something that 's exclusively refugees are affected . 
  are you kidding . 
  tuberculosis is a disease with notification requirement . 
  everybody can find these statistics and there are dozens of articles regarding the increase due to refugees in the german media . 
  and why were they employing immigrants ? 
  do they want to take away jobs from europeans or what .

  but if germany shows images of [ some potatos ] ( http://cdn4.spiegel.de/images/image-975093-galleryv9-gscx-975093.jpg ) it causes a diplomatic crisis and kaczinsky cancels his trip to germany . 
   a cursory reading of quran and hadiths reveals that that woman is an educated theologian and asserts that nothing she does is agains anything written in the quran and tells her critics to actually read the quran for once .
