  defend europe from refugees with a crew from sri lanka that applies for refugee status . 
   `` it has come to our knowledge that us organisations are paying for the boats taking thousands of refugees to europe . '', 
  christ , that 's a lie invented by the russians and released by infodirekt . 
  they even wrote that the us handed out travel guides . 
   austrian magazine infodirekt if you want to reveal a conspiracy try to find out who 's behind infodirekt considering they hide behind letterbox companies and have lots of connections to russia . 
  just based on articles about the book : the author is afraid that all nations will go extinct due to some sort of global collective and that germans like others will stop to exist due to that . 
  nothing too crazy so far . 
  but in the last chapters of the book ( which caused the outcry ) he starts talking about the `` auschwitz myth '' , `` the dubious number of 6 million killed in the holocaust '' and says that the fate of the jews `` those who killed our christ and saviour '' is somehow interlinked to those of the germans . 
  a spiegel journalist praised the book which boosted its popularity and caused an outcry . 
  now der spiegel removes it from the bestseller list and it causes another outcry . 
  the author should send a gift basket to them because der spiegel is responsible for all the publicity . 
   intentionally derail the discussion . 
  oh god , the irony . 
  you started that shit in a discussion about poland . 
  of course , every language including arabic is better than danish . 
  even without your flag it would be obvious you 're american . 
  you should call your local antifa hotline . 
  they handle the payment for soros and tend to be very helpful and costumer oriented . 
  when my payment was late i received some bonus shekels . 
   date 17.07.2017 you know , you could actually post a recent article because it turns out we know more about it some days later . 
  well , duh . 
   the spokeswoman , heather nauert , said : `` we are concerned about polish government 's continued pursuit of legislation that appears to limit the judiciary and potentially weaken the rule of law in poland '' . 
  well , weaken the rule of law if it 's any better . 
  and the us date department . 
  yeah , that 's definitely the worst thing about 77 people getting killed ... 
  no problem . 
  i just find it ironic because that logic was pretty common in germany during the eastern enlargement of the eu . 
  yes , i am . 
  do you honestly believe i want to purge all eu citizens ? 
  i can do that for other countries too if it makes you feel better : [ 45000 crimes ] ( https://www.bka.de/shareddocs/downloads/de/publikationen/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/2016/standardtabellen/tatverdaechtige/std-tv-12-t54-polen_excel.xlsx?__blob=publicationfile&amp;v=4 ) were committed by poles alone in germany just last year . 
  dozens of germans killed or murdered , hundreds of women sexually assaulted , dozens of women raped because merkel likes to keep our borders open for eu `` immigrants '' . 
  people like to shit on algerians but the truth still remains that in absolute numbers germans are way more likely to be assaulted by eu citizens . 
  do you really want to tell to women that were raped or families of those murdered that the open border policy is not bad because those 2000 gambians are more likely to rape someone than those 1.5 million poles ? 
  ( sorry poland , you 're just a good example ) edit : yeah , just go ahead and down vote the truth !, 
  keep drinking that eu kool aid by mutti merkel and ignore those [ german women ] ( http://mobil.wochenblatt.de/nachrichten/landshut/regionales/hilfsbereitschaft-der-nachbarin-mit-vergewaltigung-gedankt-;art67,335677 ) getting raped by eu citizens . 
  and americans are 2x as likely to commit sexual assault compared to native germans . 
  i do n't understand why we allow that . 
  people from a country with a rate higher than those of natives should not be allowed to settle in germany . 
  if one of those 5 maltese guys would rape a single woman they would jump to the top . 
   mental gymnastics  hellbent on destroying your country, 
   `` no no no , those refugees take our women . 
  why ? 
  because cultural marxism introduced by the elite ( soros aka jews ) make women go crazy for those brown men . 
  that 's why hard working christian white men ca n't find a woman anymore ! '', 
  logic by people that ca n't find a girlfriend . 
  or we realize many americans in germany are young men due to the military which skews the statistics . 
  same thing applies to refugees . 
  it does n't explain all of it but it gives context . 
  we could actually talk about culture once we adjust for age , poverty and other stuff . 
  well the us seems to be pretty inferior to other western countries judging by this graph . 
   the bottom five in the index are russia , the czech republic , hungary , brazil and turkey , suggesting authoritarian regimes opposed to migrants have less soft power . 
  til brazil and turkey are opposed to migrants and czech republic is an autoritarian regime . 
  the project in russia ( not crimea ) was legal though . 
  yeah , hard to understand why people would be angry about an innocent photographer who was trapped and drowned in the sinking ship . 
   they themselves commit acts of terror such as ? 
  [ bismarck handing germania the sword unitas ] ( http://www.museum-digital.de/data/san/images/201411/06160859226.jpg ), 
  despite the political differences they both share some form of respect for each other . 
  there was an article that apparently merkel tried to outsmart putin during their daily phone calls during the height of the ukraine crisis by getting to know the details of all the russian military movements bevor . 
  diplomats were joking that merkel knew the position of each russian artillery piece better than the russian military . 
  she used it to annoy putin and win smaller diplomatic battles . 
  you 're really on a mission today are n't you . 
  god , trump 's suit is looking even worse when he 's standing next to macron . 
  how can one take bad shots of a potato ? 
  yes , there are literally dozens of people in this thread defending that . 
  [ arrests in athens as protest turns violent during obama 's visit to greece ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/europe/greece-athens-obama-protests/index.html ) so we 're trash brothers ? 
  that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
  `` protests '' like that happen at every g20/g7 summit that is n't held in a police state : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_g20_toronto_summit_protests https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_g20_london_summit_protests http://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-summit-protests-iduskbn18n0p3 not the entire universe moves around trump . 
  wow , i did n't know poland hold another g20 summit . 
  what does all that have to do with poland ? 
  antifa gmbh handles to contract stuff . 
  i mean you get 600 $ for few hours of protesting here . 
  soros pays good money . 
  trade does n't need a `` winner '' and can be beneficial to all parties . 
  that 's still true despite trump being president . 
   a conservative estimate modelled on the experience of the eu-korea trade agreement puts the welfare effects for japan at about eur 9 bn , which is equivalent to 0.23 % of gdp in 2014 . 
  at the same time , the eu member states can expect total income gains worth about eur 11 bn per year . 
  the countries with the largest gains in absolute numbers are germany ( eur 3.4 bn ) , the united kingdom ( eur 1.6 bn ) , france ( eur 1.2 bn ) , and the netherlands ( eur 0.9 bn ) . 
  in terms of relative gains , the countries with the largest gains are ireland ( 0.19 % ) , the netherlands ( 0.14 % ) , luxembourg ( 0.13 % ) , and germany ( 0.11 % ) . 
  derived income gains are expected to materialise every year after a ramp-up period of about 10 years after the fta comes into force . 
  applying a different scenario , informed by the average trade effects of a large set of existing trade agreements , welfare gains are several times larger than our lowest bound estimates . 
  [ well it sure looks like trump is intimidated by merkel ] ( https://gnusocial.ch/file/8aad6ee42e576e20c3b64ae12917afc45da9da22b3bdf9b599f7f3fc8401036d.jpg ), 
  rule of thumb : americans just throw pills at medical problems . 
  lots of pills .

  they will have no veto and wo n't be able to stop anything . 
  still a much better outcome compared to the situation today . 
   history repeats itself they say * barely four years after the non-existent greek state 's first loan , the `` country '' declared its first bankruptcy by failing to pay off the loan 's interest . 
  * 1893 , then-prime minister charilaos trikoupis announced greece 's second bankruptcy with the historic phrase : `` regretfully , we are bankrupt . '', 
  * in 1932 , the country declared bankruptcy due to the inability of another pm , eleftherios venizelos , to understand the consequences of the economic crash of 1929 * throughout the 1950s , american correspondents in athens spoke of about 5,000 members of the greek upper class who were basically siphoning off the country 's international financing -- even using fuel sent for agricultural machinery for their own cars . 
  he just started talking about something else like every politician getting caught up in his bullshit . 
   random topic  let me tell you about refugees !, 
  people like you are like the jehovas witnesses . 
  so sarkozy offering to share the nukes with germany did n't happen ? 
  til cuba is part of nato . 
  congratulations you 're a terror sympathiser . 
  how did you want to come to the uk considering you 're more likely to die on the way to the airport ? 
  i know that it 's more expensive and meant the direct wage bill goes down which is good for the company if the economy slows down . 
  so flexibility as you explained . 
  contractors that worked alongside employees for years and give their best for the company are n't allowed to join the christmas party each team organises because the law requires a separation . 
  how is that not disgusting ?
