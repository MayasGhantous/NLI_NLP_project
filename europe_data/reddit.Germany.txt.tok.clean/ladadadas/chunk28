  people actually boycotted these parties due to that . 
  temporary contracts and temporary workers have become the norm in many sectors . 
  just as an example most of the engineering in german cars today is done by engineers that are n't actually employed by the car company they work for . 
  the benefit for the company is that it decreases their wage bill because they can cancel the contract with the company you work for just like that . 
  the downside for you is that your time company can send you to another part of germany within a week . 
  so having a family ( low fertility ) and seeing friends becomes harder for people working within this scheme . 
  the laws have changed and guarantee you the same salary as someone working for the company you work as a contractor but that does n't include benefits . 
  i did an internship in the management of a german car company and i was so incredibly disgusted by that . 
  the irony is that even most the managers were disgusted by it and thought it was stupid . 
  so in conclusion people have a job ( which in my opinion is still better than being unemployed ) but if you open the box there seems to be no way back because companies exploit it . 
  here 's my german ass :  174 out of 192 ( aka 90 % ) antisemitic crimes in berlin ( one of the highest percentages of muslims of all german states ) committed by right wing extremists [ source ] ( http://amp.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/antisemitismus-in-berlin-192-straftaten-aus-judenhass/11470932.html ), 
   growing antisemitic violence by mena immigrants it 's true that antisemitic violence is growing in germany . 
  however 90 % of those are committed by rightwingers . 
  what now ? 
   a bearded man , wearing black trousers and a grey sweatshirt , was seen being held against the fence with his arms behind his back by a police officer . 
  black trousers * and * grey sweatshirt . 
  those are relevant news . 
  something similar happened in hamburg . 
  the owner of an apartment building refused to rent the flats so the city forced him to . 
  ( the international rightwing media claimed the city used it for refugees which was a lie ), 
  dumb-complex-things-down-to-simple-explanations-that-suit-your-agenda syndrome, 
  he just took orban by his word :  europeans oppressed by liberalism welcome to seek asylum in hungary . 
  naturally , we will take in the real refugees , orban said at his annual state of the union address . 
  `` the panicked german , dutch , french and italian politicians and journalists , christians forced to leave their countries will find here the europe they lost at home . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/europeans-oppressed-by-liberalism-welcome-to-seek-asylum-in-hungary/a-37506666 ), 
  death-threatening judges , politicians and other people is freedom of speech ? 
  yes , just to give a ballpark figure . 
  it could also mean he 's a descendant of french huguenots that came to germany as refugees in 1685 . 
  ( darn refugees ) also we need to determine which tribe his ancestors are from to determine if he 's really germanic . 
  on the otherhand if it turns out he 's actually bavarian one can argue he 's not german afterall . 
  people are joking about the percentage increase but that boosts the uk into the top 10 of countries whose citizens became german . 
   , dass that should award you a german citizenship right away . 
   i just wonder if this is another case when the police will keep saying that `` we do n't know if this incident was connected to terrorism '' like the bvb bombing or like the munich shooting were reddit knew from the beginning that it was islamist terror and people like you said they just do n't want to admit it ? 
  `` brown '' =  see , it 's always those immigrants , religion of peace `` white '' =  sad , mental health problems `` white , rightwing extremist '' =  well , what do you expect when politicians do n't listen !, 
  show a single pro sharia post then . 
  the printed version is still much better . 
  it 's way more extrem with spiegel ( online ) though . 
  without syria , iraq and afghanistan there would be no refugee crisis . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_ ( non-eu ) _ asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states , _ 2014_and_2015 _ ( thousands_of_first_time_applicants ) _ yb16-de . png, 
  to be fair it was reported like that in germany too . 
  both words more imply it 's among drunken retards in a bar . 
  professional fighting is always k\u00e4mpfen . 
   at least there are no bombings here . 
  thank god !, 
  otherwise those muslims would bring intolerance and say beat up people they assume to be gay . 
  yes , when she 's working as a bad undercover spy . 
  http://cdn4.spiegel.de/images/image-4827-galleryv9-zxpn-4827.jpg also while searching for yeti https://www.welt.de/img/politik/mobile101192468/5222502627-ci102l-w1024/jsauer-2006-messner-dw-vermischtes-cibiana-di-cadore-jpg.jpg, 
  stagnating at 6 % growth per year ? 
   it 's economics 101 never in the history of mankind has anyone with an actual understanding of economics said that . 
  it 's a myth that german soldiers risked their life for something like that . 
  historians found out that soldiers that refused to participate in war crimes were `` punished '' with things like a postponed promotion or guard duty . 
  in most cases nothing happened almost if people knew what they did was wrong . 
  so why did they ditch the plans for new coal plants ? 
  fair enough . 
  i was just surprised . 
   what about fracking technology ? 
  its leading to opecs irrelevance and has seen more investment than renewables have . 
  citation that this is true on a global scale ? 
  italien coke is different than german coke . 
  so what 's the gold standard there ? 
  that applies to thousands of products . 
  it 's just not a problem that can be solved politically . 
  that would require the approval of russia which will never happen . 
  or she likes to separate professional and private life . 
  til that i own the same powerful vessel as the czech navy . 
  because the headline is not in the article and you should at least read the entire sentence :  merkel said the german government must help new french president emmanuel macron to succeed [ ... ] to fight unemployment in france and adding that the best way to counter populists was to solve problems . 
  so why does the free market reject nuclear ? 
  less than 5 % of their energy comes from fossil fuels . 
  are solar and wind not feasible in switzerland or are there other reasons that it seems that low ? 
  der spiegel 2010 , only in german though . 
  the russians actually offered to give back k\u00f6nigsberg / kaliningrad during the reunification negotiations but germany rejected . 
  [ putin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfkkbsv5lyu ) also said as a joke his open for that idea but only if all borders that changed during ww2 are up for debate including those of poland . 
  4 % of the german population . 
  ( and a birth rate of 1.8 to shatter another myth ) [ source in german ] ( http://blog.initiativgruppe.de/2014/06/04/statistik-4-turkischstammige-in-deutschland/ ) berlin is a single large city that overrepresents turkish/muslim immigration even more so because they 're mostly in some districts . 
   as a gay person , anti-discrimination laws apply to anyone offering a service and i do n't think a church should be any different . 
  as it bad as it is they are already different . 
  the church in germany is allowed to fire people if they leave church or join another religion . 
  it 's disgusting for a western country but nobody seems to care . 
  free lunch or free breakfast ? 
  now that are the real decisions . 
  about 5,4 % to 5,7 % of the german population is muslim . 
  so not really . 
  but they do n't have a problem begging for german tourists and german companies . 
  why is the media making him famous by constantly showing his image ? 
   according to a colleague of my step-dad it was because you guys never vote for us in eurovision . 
  germanexit confirmed . 
  it makes sense now because it 's popular . 
  let 's see if it makes sense when the plumber and labour intensive products get more expensive . 
  so why is the headline talking about wealth ? 
   one of the most wealthy [ ... ] man in germany that 's not even remotely true . 
  m\u00fcller earned between 1 and 4 million euro as porsche ceo and had no fortune before . 
  to reach the most wealthy 500 in germany you need at least 200 million . 
  there are 13 sites dedicated to macron and not a single sentence about him stealing money from germany . 
  it 's mostly a mixture of optimism and is he really as good as it seems ? 
  i 'm not sure if you 're serious but nothing like that is written in the spiegel . 
  there are 13 sites dedicated to macron . 
  about 8 of them are an analysis of his persona , the reasons he won and his party . 
  then there are 3 sites on the future relationship with germany citing both hopes that he 's just what europe needs but also caution if he 's actually going to deliver . 
  then you have an interview with sch\u00e4uble praising macron . 
  so where 's the crusade you talk about ?
