  yes , there are limits to freedom of speech in germany like in many other countries , say hungary :  a person who incites to hatred before the general public against  a ) the hungarian nation ,  b ) any national , ethnic , racial group or certain groups of the population ,  shall be punishable for a felony offense with imprisonment up to three years . 
   eu values , ** such as free expression ** , freedom from political censorship [ ... ] are far more shat upon by western countries wikipedia :  freedom of speech is the right to articulate one 's opinions and ideas without fear of government retaliation or censorship , or societal sanction . 
  the term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, 
   ** bulgaria is ranked lower in the world press freedom index than any other european union member ** . 
  this is due to an environment dominated by corruption and collusion between media , politicians , and oligarchs including deylan peevski , a former head of bulgaria 's main intelligence agency and owner of the new bulgarian media group . 
  his group has six newspapers and controls nearly 80 % of print media distribution . 
  the government 's allocation of eu funding to certain media outlets is conducted with a complete lack of transparency , in effect bribing editors to go easy on the government in their political reporting or refrain from covering certain problematic stories altogether . 
  is that what you talk about ? 
   whereas ee countries are far , far closer to the classical european liberalism view on freedom and political/social discourse , with no one fearing his life might be ruined if he expressed `` the wrong '' ideas or attitudes freedom of press index 2017 :  germany place 14  hungary place 71  bulgaria 104 is that your liberalism ?

  i don ' get how a youtube video without context is upvoted like that . 
  yes , his opinion is merely that all jews should be expelled from germany and that hate for jews is a sign of a working immune system . 
  besides that he also threatened several judge , politicians and attorneys with death . 
  it 's like you ca n't even have an opinion in germany !, 
  that 's the consumer price in germany not the one most of the industry pays . 
  the wholesale price ironically went down due to the renewables which means energy intensive industry profits .

  last 24 hours :  6570 points : muslim cleric in germany telling germans that their women will be force to marry muslim men , that arabic will be the language that germans will be forced to learn , and that education will be lead by muslim teachings and teachers .

   germany recently signed memoranda with greece , italy , latvia , portugal , slovakia and spain to help set up vocational-education systems .

   there is no evidence that forcing companies to put workers in power helps the economy . 
  [ michel 2007 ] ( http://ot-ds.sipr.ucl.ac.be/cps/ucl/doc/etes/documents/wdw004.pdf )  co-determination allows for a flexible non-bureaucratic , efficient and peaceful organisation of production . 
  in times of increased economic pressures , this is of particular importance . 
  ** strike days in germany have been significantly below oecd average ** . 
  between 1991 and 2000 , there have been about 9 strike days per 1000 employees and year in germany -- compared to about 31 strike days in belgium , 51 in the us and 169 in denmark . 
  [ berger 2016 ] ( http://bruegel.org/2016/10/codetermination-in-germany-a-role-model-for-the-uk-and-the-us/ ) :  some authors have questioned why codetermination should be made mandatory . 
  [ ... ] employees might have a similar objective function as shareholders ( or their representatives ) aiming at the long-run survival of the firm , in which case employee representation could actually be beneficial for shareholders . 
  the shareholders as members of the supervisory board can change the managers ' compensation structure to incentivize them to act according to their interest . 
  ** dyballa and kraft ( 2016 ) find evidence that employee representation is beneficial in that regard . 
  ** [ ... ] due to their knowledge of a firm 's operations and processes , employees are good at monitoring managerial performance and bring first-hand knowledge to the board 's decision making ( edwards et al 2009 , fauver and fuerst 2006 ) . 
  to conclude , there is plenty of evidence that the german stakeholder system of codetermination has been a positive experience , although there are also strong doubts about whether it is efficient or optimal . 
  [ boneberg 2010 ] ( http://www.leuphana.de/fileadmin/user_upload/forschungseinrichtungen/ifvwl/workingpapers/wp_177_upload.pdf ) :  the results of both the t-test and the regression models indicate that productivity per employee is , on average , significantly higher in companies with supervisory boards than in companies without them . 
  on the other hand , at least the kolmogorov-smirnov test reports lower profitability in companies with supervisory boards than in those without them . 
  summing up , then , productivity appears to be higher and profitability likely lower in corporations that have a co-determined supervisory board . 
  this result is congruent with the idea of freeman and lazear ( 1995 ) , who claim that ** worker participation raises productivity as the employees put more effort into their work , but lowers profitability as highly productive workers exert more influence on the distribution of a company 's rent . 
  it 's not a quiz when there 's an article  only about 1.1 % of the world population is german . 
  however , 48 % of the mid-sized world market leaders come from germany . 
  these firms , which i call `` hidden champions , '' are part of what makes german economic growth more inclusive : by my calculations , they have created 1.5 million new jobs ; have grown by 10 % per year on average ; and register five times as many patents per employee as large corporations . 
  and they are resilient : my estimate is that in the last 25 years no more than 10 % of them disappeared or were taken over , a distinctly lower percentage than for large corporations . 
  nearly all of them survived the great recession of 2008-2009 . 
  it 's david cameron all over again . 
  do something that helps you get elected and pay the price for it later . 
  to be fair the data is pretty old . 
  you can more recent data from index mundi . 
   eu : male : 77.4 years , female : 83.2 years ( 2016 est. ), 
   us : male 77.5 years , female : 82.1 years ( 2016 est. ), 
  so it has become pretty even for males ( probably due to central europe catching up ) http://www.indexmundi.com/european_union/demographics_profile.html http://www.indexmundi.com/united_states/demographics_profile.html, 
  unlike those hacking cases it ca n't be brushed aside because russian interference is not proven . 
  the entire lisa case was just embarrassing for russia and entirely changed how german politicians look at russia . 
  even lawrow went behind it and gave public statements that were broadcasted by rt germany . 
  and obviously there was no admission afterwards that it was all made up by the girls lawyer and father with hard proof to back it up . 
  ( cell phone data showing where the girl spend the night , her confession , statement of the friend she spend the night at ), 
  unlike russia and those christian african countries ? 
  2/10 soros is n't even photoshopped to look like the devil . 
  i do n't think it 's surprising that the swiss want to know more and it seems like the german federal prosecutor is trying to keep the noise down too . 
  they did n't even mention the nationality in the press release . 
  the whole thing is probably going to be solved diplomatically . 
  in germany 's social market economy there 's a power balance between the employer and employee side where as elon musks acts like a mixture between luis xvii and marie antoinette . 
  when employees criticised a culture of over working and low wages he reacted by brushing all that aside promising free frozen yogurt and a great party once tesla will become profitable .
