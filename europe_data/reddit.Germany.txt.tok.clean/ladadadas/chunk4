  yes , you 're right it was a low effort comment . 
  just like making copy pasta comments taken straight from / r/polfacts the subreddit for `` red pill facts about iq/race/crime / gender '' `` use this subreddit to store pre-formatted text and images about crime/race/iq / gender/economics and whatever politics related facts you ca n't find which are useful for debates . '', 
  here 's your comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/polfacts/comments/2w18wr/muslim_immigration_fact_dump/, 
  k. edit : `` through interviews with 2,482 americans , gallup found that ** 78 percent of muslims believe violence which kills civilians is never justified , whereas just 38 percent of protestant christians and 39 percent of catholics agreed with that sentiment . 
  fifty-six percent of atheists answered similarly . 
  ** when gallup put the question a bit more pointedly , asking if it would be justified for `` an individual person or a small group of persons to target and kill civilians , '' the responses were a bit more uniform . 
  respondents from nearly all groups were widely opposed to such tactics , with protestants and catholics at 71 percent against . 
  muslims still had the highest number opposed , at 89 percent . 
  seventy-six percent of atheists were also opposed . '',

  itt : redditors posting their favourite copy pasta and a higher amount of redditors from / r/cowntown and / r/european than / r/europe . 
  also i wonder , why people now cry cencorship but nobody had a problem when there were megathreads for other events like the greece crisis . 
  by the way : thank you mods !, 
  no , why would the users at / r/european be obsessed with what / r/europe discusses . 
  and why do they have the need to crosspost posts from here to their sub ? 
  and this is you posting several threads about / r/europe and comments from here at / r/european ? 
  are we a bit obsessed with this sub here ?

  `` immonen standing among members of the `` finnish resistance movement '' , an organisation which has been linked with a number of armed attacks on gay rights protestors , and with a stabbing at a 2013 book launch . '', 
  why are they hating gay people . 
  surley they must be muslims who do n't integrate into our society ? 
  do n't be silly we do n't need evidence to support prejudices . 
  we just suppose it is a muslim attack as long as we can . 
  and if it is n't we just switch to another topic . 
  just as we supposed in germany that the killing of several immigrants had to be connected to drug dealers . 
  because obviously that 's what immigrants do . 
  and in the end it turned out neonazis were killing the immigrants who were entirely innocent . 
  whoops . 
  so say it . 
  hitler was n't actually bad , he was a hero right ? 
  jesus , i had no idea . 
  so this hitler guy was n't that bad was he ? 
  or are you afraid a super jewish warriror will kill you for it ? 
  `` illegal immigration from places where 30-50 % as opposed to 0.1 % of people have aids '' according to wikipedia the country with the highest aids prevelance rate world wide is swaziland with 26,5 % and latvia with 0,7 % in europe . 
  considering these values are the upper bounds it can be concluded that your comment is bullshit and you 're an idiot . 
  `` the culture of critique : an evolutionary analysis of ** jewish involvement in twentieth-century intellectual and political movements . 
  ** '' well , at least you are on of the more honest people in this thread and you have finally completed the circle from immigrants to da jews !!,

  strange , how nobody has given you an answer yet ... almost as if they just made that up . 
  name some of these no-go-zones please ? 
  i just do n't understand what happened to the uk that they 're so dedicated to undermine civil rights in the recent years . 
  someone should tell them they 're way to late for the post 7/7 or 9/11 scare . 
  cheddar is n't a protected name in europe especially because it is an anglosphere thing . 
  `` washington is pressing for language that would allow countries in the asia-pacific deal to reject protections for european regional food names ** if they could be confused with trademarks or common names . 
  ** '' that would basically be the same as abolishing the system altogether because all the protected names are common names . 
  also it seems like we could n't sell parmesan as parmesan in the us if parmesan is a registered trade mark . 
  that sounds sensible . 
  people after the massacre : charlie hebdo has the freedom to ridicule whoever they want . 
  we stand with france !, 
  freedom of press !, 
  people now : how dare they stop making fun of muhammed !, 
  let 's make some highly innovative surrender jokes about france !, 
  people here seem to have the strange urge to tell charlie hebdo what to publish instead of letting them do whatever the fuck they want . 
  as if they have no clue what freedom actually means . 
  it obviously is wrong but it 's still not that big of a deal . 
  as soon as you 're 14 you can opt-out even without consent of your parents . 
  `` fuck you mom , / r/atheism told me the truth ! '', 
  i 've found a breakdown where their money goes ( for the protestant church though ) : 19,6 % pastor service & religious education in schools . 
  18,8 % day-care centres 12,3 % community work with children and teenagers 10,4 % maintenance of churches and day-care centres 8,0 % administration 5,5 % pensions 5,5 % social work 3,3 % finance stuff 2,3 % education and * science * ( whatever that means ) 1,8 % other social services 1,8 % cemeteries 1,7 % evangelization 1,6 % goes back to the state for collecting the money 0,8 % public relations https://www.evangelisch.de/inhalte/113540/08-11-2013/wofuer-gibt-die-kirche-die-kirchensteuer-aus, 
  as far as i remember the us media was very compliant to begin the war on iraq with only 3 % opposing the invasion . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/iraq_war_media_sources_opinion_percentage.svg `` unlike the vietnam war , when the media regularly published photographs of flag-draped coffins of american military personnel killed in action , the bush administration prohibited the release of such photographs during the iraq invasion . '', 
  this guy was not convicted because he was in the ss . 
  he was personally involved in the `` selection '' of people at the ramp in auschwitz . 
  that is a direct and personal involvement and why he was prosecuted . 
  the german justice system has changed in the fact that in the years after the war there had to be an actual victim with name for a prosecuation . 
  now the participation in the `` elimination machine '' is enough for a prosecution . 
  this guy was not only in the ss but personally involved in the `` selection '' of people at the ramp in auschwitz . 
  he was prosecuted because of this direct and personal involvement . 
  resistance fighter against the actual nazi regime = sjw . 
  this is as retarded as it gets . 
  `` the real damage is done by those millions who want to survive . 
  the honest men who just want to be left in peace . 
  those who do n't want their little lives disturbed by anything bigger than themselves . 
  those with no sides and no causes . '', 
  sophie scholl yes , he was just a small part of the machine and yet he was still part of the machine . 
  following orders is no valid excuse.the sentence is not just `` for show '' it 's about showing that his acts are not forgotten and not forgiven . 
  it 's beyond me how you can say it 's about trying to make up for germany 's history . 
  what would you recommend what we should do ? 
  not giving him a trail would be a slap in the face of all survivors and victims . 
  the headline is as close to a lie as it gets . 
  netzpolitik is not accused of treason . 
  the head of the domestic intelligence service ( verfassungsschutz ) has filed charges to find out who witin his agency regularly leaks classified information to netzpolitik . 
  it 's like saying : `` world wide manhunt for new york times '' when they published the snowden files . 
  if i remember correctly there 's a great politcial essay by albert camus regarding the time at the end of the war in france . 
  surprisingly it actually * is * possible to outsmart an attacker with knive by say running in circles around a table or simply running away . 
  ar-15 ... not so much . 
  it was n't my intention to mock anyone but rather to show how ridiculously brave the employees must have been to face an armed attacker with nothing but zip-ties . 
  also , this happened in the same district where i 'm from . 
  i was just coming home from munich when i heard on the radio what happened and was personally worried about family and friends . 
  sadly this is second time such a thing happens here . 
  in 2009 a student committed a rampage at his school . 
  fortunately he could n't get a gun ( despite trying legally and illegaly ) and did n't manage to kill anyone with his axe and several molotow cocktails . 
  during the day another student that was slightly physically disabled and just like the attacker did n't have many friends became the hero of his school by immediatley calling the police and putting out the fire with a fire-extinguisher . 
  ~ ~ ze polizei ~ ~ the police actually managed to get the guy alive by shooting into his arm and stomach . 
  he 's now getting help in a psychiatry . 
  sir , guns are not allowed in zis store !, 
  please put down ze gun !, 
  hurr , durr i 'm on a killing spree . 
  sir , zis is against ze rules !, 
  zis is it .
