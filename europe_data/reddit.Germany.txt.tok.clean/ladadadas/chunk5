  fact : a thing that is known or proved to be true .

  the greek finance minister 's notes ... euclid tsakalotos appears to have committed a schoolboy error at his first eurogroup meeting , by allowing his notes ( written on hotel paper ! ), 
  to be photographed . 
  yes , but the other europeans are in a ( relatively ) better negotiation position . 
  no further agreement will have unforeseeable consequences for all sides . 
  but as far as i can tell it will horific for greece . 
  well , yes they all are . 
  but tsipras has to betray everything he stands for , the public and his party to reach an agreement . 
  even more so after he has slained the evil dragon with his referendum . 
  i honeslty do n't know if it 's true but according to a press conference with sch\u00e4uble greece only has to pay back the next loans in 2020 or 2022 . 
  therefore he ruled out a debt relief right now . 
  he basically wants to wait how greece implements reforms in the next years and use the possible debt reliefe as an incentive . 
  tsipras however wants a debt relief right now which sch\u00e4uble refuses because there would be no incentive for reforms . 
  fair point . 
  but i do n't think it will work . 
  apparently merkel already crossed her partys line with her last offer to tsipras before the referendum . 
  the sentiments in germany after the referendum are now even worse with 80-90 % against more money for greece . 
  while i agree that greece needs more room for economic growth there will be no deal without * really * hard reforms . 
  also while a haircut will eventually come ( even sch\u00e4uble knows that ) it will not happen until these reforms are implemented . 
  ( unless hollande and france can persuade germany ) tsipras however seems entirely ideologically driven . 
  so i do n't see how there will be a deal which is really sad . 
  i personally just do n't understand how tsipras can talk about a `` strengthened negotiation position '' while his ship is sinking just like before the referendum . 
  tsipras has to offer a deal not the other way round . 
  without an agreement greece is going down the hard way . 
  and yet i feel like he will gamble till the last day and no common solution will be found . 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  in germany you can also choose what kind of bills you want . 
  at least at my bank . 
  when i withdraw 100 $ i usually get 50 +20 +10 +10 +5 +5 $ without further specification . 
  `` but the biggest crime is for the current generation , they have nothing to do with it yet they will pay for some stuff other people did . '', 
  i believe that 's the actual tragedy . 
  it 's not up to you whether you 're born in a successful or failing european country . 
  and yet it determines how your life is looking right now . 
  it 's easy to say it does n't matter to me if greece is going down . 
  and yet i could just as well be a greece citizen . 
  also these personal disputes we like to discuss : sch\u00e4uble vs. varoufakis and asshole vs. 
  idiot that determine the outlook of millions of people . 
  it 's fucking ridiculous . 
  well , in germany the magazine that was spied on is called `` sturmgesch\u00fctz der demokratie '' ( assault gun of democracy ) . 
  so you better be worried . 
  we do n't . 
  that 's a fair point . 
  fromer reddit employee is doing an iama right now : `` back in 2011 , i applied for a job at reddit . 
  in late 2011 , after a series of interviews , i received a call from / u/hueypriest offering me the position of community manager . 
  however , in early 2012 , a week before i was supposed to move to san francisco , i was unexpectedly diagnosed with leukemia . 
  i spent the next six of seven months in the hospital and received four enormous rounds of chemo as well as a bone marrow transplant . 
  eventually i was cured of leukemia ( or so i thought ) and was finally able to begin working at reddit . 
  about a year went by while i worked ( mostly remotely ) for reddit , until i was once again ready to move to their headquarters . 
  unfortunately , weeks before moving , i had relapsed and my leukemia came back , this time harder than ever . 
  during this time , i had sat down with ellen pao ( current reddit ceo ) to discuss my future at reddit and when i was able to move . 
  i had told her that it would still be at least a month ( but probably closer to 2 or 3 ) before i was finally able to move to sf , and she said she was 100 % fine with that . 
  we discussed my position , and ultimately determined that i would be returning to the community management team . 
  i met some of the new members of the team , all was well , and then i flew home on day 3 . 
  less than a month later , in february of 2015 , i received a call from ellen stating that i was to be terminated in less than a week . 
  when i asked what the specific reason was , she had roughly stated that `` because of our discussion , you are too sick to properly fulfill your duties as community manager . '' ( at no point during our meeting was this stated - i had raised concerns about the stress levels of community management , but had ultimately decided that it was something i could easily manage . ) '', 
  do n't think that would be legal in any european country . 
   at what point is this not capable of being ` democratically influenced ' ? 
  when the us restricts european members of the government to read the ttip text at us embassys ? 
  what makes the us so special that they can make up the rules ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/downloads/11317374/1/access%20rules%20to%20consolidated%20texts ) is the leaked procedure for access to t-tip consolidated texts in u.s. embassies : * member state officials will be welcome to read approved t-tip consolidated texts in u.s. embassies during two designated days each week , ideally mondays and wednesdays , by appointment only . 
  * appointments will be limited to two hours . 
  * two member state officials will be allowed to visit the u.s. embassy to review documents at a time . 
  * the ** rooms in which documents are read will be monitored by u.s. embassy personnel , who will remain in the room to ensure that procedures are followed and documents are not removed . 
  ** how is this a fair deal when non-us governments are n't even allowed to read the ttip text without someone from the us looking over their shoulders ? 
  i 'm honestly trying to understand you but do n't get it . 
  '' [ ... ] they 're just saying a government ca n't demand the source code to any software they use that 's not critical infrastructure . 
  that 's literally all it says . '', 
  a government that requires access to the source code is basically looking for open source software . 
  that will not be allowed . 
  so how does the draft not hinder open source requirements ? 
  that 's actually not how i interpret the article . 
  ( sorry about linking to techdirt ) i would argue that the proposed article would make it possible for a closed source company to sue if open source software was prefered for the open source reason . 
  that seems rather stupid to me especially because open source software has its benefits . 
  i understand that it is just a draft and will likely change . 
  what i do n't understand is why you mistrust techdirts interpretation or even use it . 
  article 6 seems pretty straightforward to me . 
  wikileaks published the confidential tisa draft : `` article 6 : ... 
  transfer or access to source code 1 . 
  ** no party may require the transfer of , or access to , source code of software owned by a person of another party , as a condition of providing services related to such software in its territory . 
  for purposes of this article , software subject to paragraph 1 is limited to mass-market software , and does not include software used for critical infrastructure . '', 
  the current draft would make it impossible to require open source software unless it is software used for critical infrastructure .

  court of justice of the european union : `` by today 's judgment , the court of justice reiterates that eu law requires that the consumer have correct , neutral and objective information that does not mislead him and that the labelling of food can not mislead . 
  while the consumer is assumed to read the list of ingredients before purchasing a product , the court does not exclude the possibility that the labelling of the product may be such as to mislead the purchaser , when some of the items on the labelling are misleading , erroneous , ambiguous , contradictory or incomprehensible . 
  the court makes clear that , in such a case , ** the list of ingredients , even though correct and comprehensive , may not be capable of correcting sufficiently theerroneous or misleading impression which the consumer gains from the labelling of the foodstuff . 
  therefore , where the labelling of a foodstuff gives the impression that a particular ingredient is present in that foodstuff , even though it is not in fact present ( this being apparent solely from the list of ingredients ) , such labelling is such as could mislead the purchaser as to the characteristics of the foodstuff in question . 
  ** [ link ] ( http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-06/cp150064en.pdf ) to the court decision . 
  from the [ link ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ecfr124_-_ttip.pdf ) that is given as source in / r/irstudies for this map : does anyone remember these impressive gdp growth numbers ttip was advertised with ? 
  '' [ ... ] research has shown that the economic benefits from ttip are likely to be smaller than originally suggested [ ... ] '' `` most serious research on ttip concludes that the macro-economic effect on the eu as a whole would be relatively modest . 
  for example , the french cepii institute predicts that a comprehensive ttip ( in other words , one that reduces non-tariff barriers as well as tariffs ) could increase the level of eu gdp by ** 0.3 percent ** over the long run and a less comprehensive ttip ( in other words , one that only reduced tariffs ) by ** less than 0.1 percent ** . 
  according to the british cepr institute , an ambitious , comprehensive ttip could increase eu gdp by ** 0.5 percent ** by 2027 and a less comprehensive treaty by ** 0.1 percent ** . 
  two german studies -- one by the german ifo institute on behalf of the bertelsmann foundation and another by the german ministry of economics -- see a much bigger potential effect of a comprehensive ttip . 
  but these studies have been widely criticised for their methodology . '',
