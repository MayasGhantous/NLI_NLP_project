  edit : the entire study is acutally very thorough and balanced . 
  i would really recommend a read . 
  the uk prefers to hang out with their very rich and slightly lunatic child that occasionally likes to go on adventures where they beat up und bully kids together that they accuse of bullying . 
  one is a socialist the other a conservative and apparently they still call each other almost daily . 
  give it another year and we will celebrate their wedding at the cath\u00e9drale notre-dame de stra\u00dfburg . 
  their child could be called europa !, 
  the european idea should be about realizing that we 're all equally important and together in this mess . 
  not making a single country better off but maximizing prosperity for all european citizens . 
  it 's almost like our countries have become siamese twins . 
  in foreign policy the german media often talks about hollande and merkel or france and germany as a single entity . 
  the uk is probably the step brother we both like to exclude . 
  this is not as simplistic as ` merica bad vs. europe good . 
  lobbyists from the us ** and ** europe are using the `` free trade '' argument to lower standards and to prevent better consumer protection in cases such as this . 
  the european commission promised us that they would not lower european standards . 
  that sounds great in theory but in cases as this we need to impose higher standards instead of giving in to lobbying . 
  40 % discount on maple syrup is such a great argument in favor of not banning carcinogenic substances !, 
  if they offer us additional 10 % on apple products we should get rid of our mandatory vacation policy too !, 
  `` impact-based assessment '' is nothing but an euphemism that profits should be taken into account when talking about banning substances . 
  it 's beyond me how that is compatible with the european precautionary principle and human dignity for that matter . 
  personally , i believe that these are the points were we as europeans will really be harmed by ttip . 
  the entire ttip criticism today is mainly focused on the ids mechanism that is probably just a nebenkriegsschauplatz ( german for minor battle that want decide the war ) . 
  our policticians will use this focus to come up with a \u201e reasonable compromise `` and congratulate each other for their hard stand . 
  it should also be recognized that the exact points ( minimal consumer protection ) will help to create jobs and stimulate the economy by x , x % . 
  the consequential harm will not be included though . 
  `` the german chemicals giant basf also complained that bans on pesticide substances will restrict the free trade with agricultural products on the global level . '', 
  poor basf . 
  first their predecessor company is dissolved for meeting the market demand for zyklon b and now the eu tries to ban their chemicals linked to cancer and male infertility . 
  that 's a clear interference with the free market !, 
  simple solution for low fertility rates : make the erasmus ( aka orgasmus in germany ) programme mandatory for all european students . 
  that seems to work . 
  based on the average alcohol consumption of erasmus students that would also stimulate the european economy significantly . 
  such a simple way to restore europe 's prosperity !, 
  :d what a crazy globalized world . 
  and i take travel advice for for my own country from an american called rick steve . 
  the video with the afd representive is really great . 
  i believe in the us they call people like that `` y' all qaeda '' . 
  she 's sad because there 's a `` trivialization of socially controversial sexual behaviour conducted by minorities . '', 
  ( poor woman does n't know that the majority now engages in sexual behaviour other than missionary position . ), 
  also telling students about the existence of homosexuals `` develuates normal sexual behavior '' . 
  but at least she 's of the opinion that `` ideologies have no business in our country . '', 
  in other news 5 witnesses connected to the right wing terrorist nsu investigation have died so far . 
  germans talking about sachsen usually mean the former gdr states not niedersachsen . 
  great quote from cecilla malmstr\u00f6m : `` i do not take my mandate from the european people . '' [ source ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/i-didn-t-think-ttip-could-get-any-scarier-but-then-i-spoke-to-the-eu-official-in-charge-of-it-a6690591.html ), 
   washington wanted the eu to replace its precautionary consumer safety principle with the liberal us approach of permitting foodstuffs until risks are are proven . 
  what could possibly go wrong . 
  france also played a crucial role in the greece crisis last year . 
  germany was pretty set on letting greece go bankrupt after the referendum . 
  even when obama told germany to reconsider its position the response in the german media was mostly `` lol , fuck off '' . 
  only when france said germany should change its position it was taken serious , started a new discussion and ultimatley made merkel change her opinion . 
  it 's also short sighted to not look at the entire image . 
  cars like the e-golf are still very expensive so most likely the program will increase the number of small electric city cars with a very limited range . 
  however these city cars will be bought as a second car or by people in the city that usually use public transport or bicycles . 
  so in the end it could even make people switch to cars and increase emissions . 
  also , why should people that solely use public transport or bicycles ( zero co2 emission ! ), 
  finance cars ? 
  if we really want to reduce emissions we should give incentives to not use cars . 
  seems like a nontrivial question :  according to the french government , which does not have the right to ask direct questions about religion and uses a criterion of people 's geographic origin as a basis for calculation , there were between 5 to 6 million muslims in metropolitan france in 2010 . 
  the government counted all those people in france who migrated from countries with a dominant muslim population , or whose parents did . 
  only 33 % of those 5 to 6 million people ( 2 million ) said they were practicing believers . 
  that figure is the same as that obtained by the ined/insee study in october 2010 . 
   the united states department of state placed it at roughly 10 % , while two 2007 polls estimated it at about 3 % of the total population . 
  the cia world factbook places it at 5 -- 10 % . 
   according to mich\u00e8le tribalat ( fr ) , a researcher at ined , an acceptance of 5 to 6 million muslims in france in 1999 was overestimated . 
  her work has shown that there were 3.7 million people of `` possible muslim faith '' in france in 1999 ( 6.3 % of the total population of metropolitan france ) . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_france ), 
  eu law dictates that any product approved by a single eu country is also approved by all other eu countries . 
  that means that other countries can sell non-purity-law beer as beer in germany while german companies can not . 
  it 's a strange case where native companies are discriminated by our government . 
  why did n't the refugees stay to fight for their country ? 
  ww2 will never end if these people are n't send back to fight for their country . 
  with the us refusing reforms of the imf and world bank to share some power the founding of the aiib was inevitably . 
  and i thinkt it was a good decision by europe to participate and have some influence from the inside instead of playing the stupid `` china evel , ignore china '' game . 
  also it seemed like a game changer that the us even lost the uk in the last minute and is more or less alone with japan in its boycott . 
  you do n't need much infrastructure for our advanced broomstick technology though . 
   easy-to-find-tax-paying hans yeah , it 's not like there 's a history of violent far right terrorists in germany that can kill people for a decade because the police suspects the killing of immigrants has to be connected to drug trafficking ( why else would someone kill immigrants ? 
  ) : `` the following crimes have been attributed to the national socialist underground : the bosphorus serial murders , a series of murders of nine immigrants ( eight turks and one greek ) ; the murder of a policewoman and attempted murder of her colleague ; the 2001 and 2004 cologne bombings ; and a series of 14 bank robberies . '', 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground )  might or might not have voiced his increasingly right believes bombing refugee shelters is voicing his believe , got it . 
   us propaganda  german bdi tells uk, 
  there would be so many winners !, 
  seems like he 's related to tom clancy . 
  if he finally bans animals from having sex in public there will be some super sheltered kids growing up in the uk that have not the slightest clue about sex . 
   welfare state programs are against the nature of reality , so they are anyway meant to doom . 
  some of these programs have been running since 1883 in germany . 
  they have survived ww1 , the economic collapse in the 1920s and ww2 . 
  so i somehow doubt you can say just like that they are meant to be doomed unless you provide some proof for that . 
  there 's place for all of our european friends !, 
  [ italy with berlusconi ] ( http://www.antenneduesseldorf.de/web/bildergalerien/2013/02/rosenmontag-duesseldorf-mottowagen/media/04.jpg ) , [ france with hollande ] ( http://www.express.de/image/2700792/2x1/940/470/d11a9026251948650a7ff39f6257a8a/pg/1488c600ce8dc588-jpg.jpg ) , [ putin ] ( http://www.antenneduesseldorf.de/web/themen/2015/02/karneval/rosenmontag2015/media/susanne_makarewicz%286%29schmal.jpg ) , [ putin and his church ] ( http://www.queer.de/bild_des_tages/putin-karneval-duesseldorf-kyrill-470.jpg ) , [ greece with tsipras ] ( http://www.ksta.de/image/view/2015/1/17/29883448,31782057,dmflashteaserres,dv1965961.jpg ), 
  yeah , europeans misunderstand the poor guy that wants to bring back torture methods `` a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding '' . 
  it 's like we do n't even want to understand this guy and his program !, 
  the literal translation would be refugee defence , yes . 
  but it would change the meaning . 
  something-abwehr does n't mean that you protect the something but protecting yourself from it . 
  repellent was just the best translation i came up with but i have no idea if it is the best fitting . 
  there was also [ this tiger tank ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2016-02/fasching-panzer-asyl-reichertshausen/bitblt-820x461-a3e51d71c8dda868e84c15b7e77b675bec3f935b/wide ) with the caption `` refugee repellent '' . 
  the media is now wondering if it was making a point about right-wing rheotric or is right-wing rhetoric itself . 
   do n't let britain leave how dare they !, 
   let britain leave how dare they !, 
  yes , and is that not an argument against nuclear power ? 
  engineers and scientists came up with several alternatives and the least safe was choosen because it was in an area next to the gdr without much political resistance . 
  nuclear power is a great technology but not within an environment driven by corrupt politics und profit maximization .
