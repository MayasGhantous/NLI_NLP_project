   it 's a country ruled by a physicist which shut down its reactors after an earthquake in japan and the myth gets repeated again . 
  germany already scheduled a phase out before merkel switched the entire policy . 
  when germany built a storage for medium radioactive waste in a former salt mine it was said to be a safe storage for thousands of years by superior german engineers and scientists but somehow it turned out that after just 30 years ( ! ), 
  the entire thing gets flooded with water and becomes instable . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asse_ii_mine#water_inflow ) that somehow makes you wonder if we are capable of running nuclear plants . 
  but how is such a solution possible without the approval of russia ? 
  assad and russia would bomb that piece of territory while calling them terrorists . 
  and i ca n't see the west defending parts of syria against russia . 
  in my opinon that 's the reason why there has to be a solution including assad and russia . 
  that a 13 year old girl lies should n't be * that * suprising . 
  but how the english speaking media and russia accused germany of a conspiracy and cover up because the police was rather suspicous of her story from the beginning is pretty disgusting . 
   fsa win you 're more likely to get a decent outcome there is no realistic scenario where the fsa is winning the civil war . 
  and talking about a decent outcome is pretty naive too because the fsa is n't even close to represent a majority of the people in syria . 
  the only semi realistic solution seems a compromise including assad , fsa and other less radical forces . 
  jesus you are retarded . 
  the same story was the top post at / r/de yesterday . 
  because the stuff that happens in germany sounds way more exiting in the english + russian speaking media . 
  same with the 13 year old girl . 
  yes , that 's what makes him a marxist !, 
  it 's the very definition of the term . 
  you 're not even allowed to say [ who is behind everything ] ( https://thisaintnews.com/static/user/pics/1400716800/1401225307_jews-are-behind-everything.png ) and calling for mob lynchings are also a no go . 
  how much more left wing does it get ? 
  ah , sorry i misunderstood you . 
  show me a single comment that says that, 
   those in germany it was a bigger story in the english speaking media and russia than it was in germany . 
  especially because it was pretty fishy and the police dismissed the rape rather soon . 
  lavrov announced 3 days ago that he was going to call the german minister regarding the case . 
  makes me wonder if he 's still going to call . 
  saying it is connected to them being immigrants from turkey is ridiculous too . 
  the same thing happens with german germans quite often . 
  it 's just the latest spin of the story . 
  that 's not true . 
  why are you saying stuff when you have no idea about german law ? 
  marocco , algeria and tunesia wil be declared `` safe countries '' in the next weeks . 
  i would consider tunesia under unrest and marocco as oppressive . 
  what 's so hard to understand ? 
  germany did the exact same thing after the war in yugoslavia had ended [ here 's ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/graphics/d27_2bv_d.gif ) the number of refugees in germany after the war . 
   yeah ... 
  i wonder how that 's going to work out like the last time when we sent home thousands of refugees after the war in yugoslavia had ended ? 
  even people with a job and all that had to leave . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.efms.uni-bamberg.de/graphics/d27_2bv_d.gif ) the number of refugees in germany after the war . 
  yes , it will not be easy to send them all back but there has never been a word that these people can stay and become german . 
  what 's so hard to understand ? 
  consensual does n't mean it was legal which it was n't because she is n't 14 and her partner older than that . 
  consensual sex among 13 year olds would be legal in germany by the way . 
  considering the story was about exactly one girl and now it looks like she made it all up , yes , the whole story is discredited . 
  pretty sure that 's sane logic too . 
  huh , but reddit and russia said it was a high ranking conspiracy by the police and merkel to cover up a refugee crime . 
  as said at / r/worldnews ( +100 ) : `` i think there is credence to her story given that sergei lavrov put his weight behind it . 
  i ca n't see him doing that if the story were faulty . '', 
  say what ? 
  the afd with their very complex world view ( lazy europeans , germany would be better off without the euro ) went down like a stone in the polls as soon as the greek crisis left the media headlines . 
  according to this [ poll ] ( http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/forsa.htm ) they would have gotten 10 % in 2014 and then they went down to 3 % again . 
  [ auto translation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zeit.de%2fpolitik%2f2016-01%2fpeschmerga-nordirak-bundeswehr-waffen ), 
  yes , at least better than the free market because it is their duty to report as objectively as possible . 
  is it perfect , no absolutely not . 
  is it better than murdoch-like media , yes absolutely . 
  so as a journalist and a member of the press which blog do you write for ? 
  npr which is quite good and important especially in the us where the media is pretty loaded with partisanship . 
  so cameron wants foreigners to take over local jobs . 
  what does that has to do with feminism for god 's sake ? 
  the most prominent german feminist magazine is and has been on your side . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.aliceschwarzer.de/artikel/das-sind-die-folgen-der-falschen-toleranz-331143 ) if you want to talk about dogmatists and disillusion you may want to include yourself too . 
   also zdf is now trying to push the `` the origin '' does not matter but the gender does '' excuse . 
  if you say something like that cite some sources . 
  i have n't heard the gender excuse being pushed by the zdf once . 
  the thing that is most discussed is how to send back criminal refugees . 
  so go ahead what benefit is it that uber adds in germany ? 
  you can already get and pay a taxi with an app ( mytaxi ) . 
  you can already share a ride with someone else if you do n't have profit interests . 
  ( mitfahrgelegenheit ) and the most common taxi in germany is something like a mercedes e-class . 
  the only and very genius innovation uber had in germany is that you can offer your ride cheaper if you tell your drivers to not pay any taxes and not have a commercial insurance . 
  next stop of the uber innovation train : cheap heart transplantations performed by skilled butchers . 
  uber is not an innovative company , it 's a parasite that leaches of society and i find it quite telling how people are often upset about `` welfare queens '' leaching from society but when it comes in form of a shiny app it 's suddenly cool and innovative . 
  it 's a certainty that white people will go extinct ? 
  why , is somebody forcing you to have interracial sex ? 
  what is so hard to let people decide who they want to have children with . 
  i still do n't believe it will do any good in the long run . 
  it 's like a late christmas present for the government in poland because it will strenghten them and justify their paranoia . 
  yeah , it 's a genius idea to calm things down and decrease the perception that germany influences the media in poland . 
  no , prussia was a well known state driven by political correctness . 
  frederick ii even wanted to build mosques and preached tolerance !, 
  probably why they have always been such a peacful country . 
  during his rule between 1712 and 1786 , frederick ii ( `` the great '' ) also showed tolerance towards other religions . 
  in reference to the state and the civil rights of catholics , he said : ** `` all religions must be tolerated and the crown must ensure that none is detrimental to the other , for each must be allowed to worship in their own way . 
  '' ** furthermore , he said : `` all religions are equal and good when the people who profess them are honest people ; ** and should turks and heathens come to populate the land , then we shall endeavor to build mosques and churches for them .

  `` the pressure on poland 's national-conservative government grows . 
  the committee responsible for media policy commissioner oettinger pleads for activating the new rule of law mechanism . 
  poland could lose its right to vote . 
  president jean-claude juncker has put the issue on the agenda . 
  juncker wants to use an instrument that has only been around 2014th it provides a structured dialogue before a member state if the commission recognizes systemic threats to the rule of law . 
  if the state does not respond to amendments from brussels , the commission shall initiate proceedings for infringement of fundamental european values . 
  this has never happened , but could lead to the withdrawal of voting rights . 
  oettinger expressed concern about the recent changes in the system of public broadcasting in poland compared to the fas . 
  parliament had a reform act by a majority of the ruling party in both chambers , allowing it to replace the management staff in the public radio and television stations . 
  the directors of four programs of the television station tvp on saturday ranged from out of their resignation , including the popular journalist tomasz lis . 
  `` a director should not be dismissed without notice for any reason . 
  that would be arbitrary , `` oettinger said . 
  `` the greater our concern is that the public service broadcasting could lose its function , namely to inform citizens independently , the more we need to strengthen the independence of regulators , '' said oettinger on .
