  assad should be thankful for the western bombings because he can now focus on the fsa and other rebel groups . 
  while nobody dares to say it the west is passively supporting assad too . 
  you guys are still part of iter and it was gorbachev that initiated the entire project . 
  so basically mother russia is the father of iter , one of the biggest international science projects the world has ever seen . 
  more belgium flairs in this thread than i have seen here in total . 
  facebook has changed it rules in that way that it will now delete comments that call for violence against a group of persons too . 
  before facebook has only deleted comments that targeted single persons say ahmed the refugee . 
  targeting ahmed the refugee 's family was okay though . 
  the article also explains that this only applies to violence and gives some funny examples for things that are still okay : calling refugees lousy social welfare parasites taking our jobs that need to go back better yesterday than tomorrow is no problem . 
  this could actually be some very weird romantic movie story . 
  `` neither prison nor death can seperate them in their fight for truth . '', 
  thank you !, 
  yes , do you ? 
  tell me , how much hard evidence do scientists and historians have about grey aliens ? 
  because we have tons of documents and other stuff proving the holocaust . 
  this comparison is so bad it could give people an aneurysm . 
  good thing we have the exact quote by himmler : * \u201e ich entlasse sie mit sofortiger wirksamkeit aus der ss , da sie nicht die primitivsten eigenschaften von disziplin und menschlicher anst\u00e4ndigkeit besitzen , die von einem ss-f\u00fchrer verlangt werden m\u00fcssen . `` * [ source in the article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/werner_georg_haverbeck ), 
  i realy do n't feel educated enough to answer that . 
  maybe someone else can answer that or you should ask at / r/askhistorians . 
  and the really fucking thing is that we have to accept that germany once willingly cheered for him . 
  same basic things that i remember from school ( we learn a lot about that there ) : * after ww1 germans felt duped by the peace treatie of versaille that they considered disgraceful . 
  hitler gave germans the hope of restoring this honor and people felt he did with his politics ( and its continuation by war ) . 
  also our democracy was very unstable with governments changing very often . 
  that made many germans disklike democracy and favour some `` hard but fair ruler '' such as hitler . 
  * this is also semi related to the hate for jews . 
  after germany lost ww1 the military pretty soon came up with the idea that they only lost because they were stabbed in the back by jews , socialists and communists . 
  ( the german solider undefeated in the field ! ), 
  historians actually found out that some english general who jokingly came up with that gave one famous german general the idea for this `` dagger legend '' . 
  in a militaristic society such as germany back then that became pretty hip . 
  so the hate hitler preached was something many germans shared with . 
  * before hitler came into power the german economy was in the gutter and hitler promised a lot of jobs and economic prosperity . 
  and he actually achieved that ! ... 
  by turning germany into an unsustainable war economy . 
  but yay , jobs and autobahn !, 
  * after hitler came into power each and ever aspect of the society was connected to the nazi ideology . 
  you are a member of the local bicycle club ? 
  now you are a member of the national social bicycle club !, 
  especially children and youngsters were schooled with ideology . 
  imaging your getting propaganda into your head from kindergarden to university . 
  at the end of the war teenagers who went through this program fought viciously for hitler ( victory or death ! ), 
  when experienced soldiers did n't give a fuck anymore because they new it was over . 
  * also i remember that my history teacher who did her phd thesis about some national social topic told us that we should n't underestimate hitlers charisma and rhetoric abilities . 
  today his speeches and style sound ridiculous but back then he was a master of this and also used radio and television perfectly . 
  what i wanted to say is that you can still be critical and raise questions . 
  ( the german law hinders research argument ) also you will get a fair trial and not some a priori sentence because you said something about the holocaust . 
  that you consider the entire law stupid because of free speech is something that i do n't challenge and understand . 
  there is often the view that the slightest critical tought about the holocaust will get you into prison in germany which is n't really correct . 
  in reality you really need to put some effort into a prosecution . 
  ( for truth and justice ! ), 
  her site is really worth a read . 
  i googled a bit about her the first time she was in the news and had a good laugth . 
  i ca n't find the site with all the sources but here are some examples : [ warning to the jewish people ] ( http://www.hagalil.com/archiv/2009/07/05/haverbeck-wetzel/ ) [ other example from here site ] ( http://ursula-haverbeck.info/zentralrat-der-juden-eine-antwort-auf-die-frage-wo-die-sechs-millionen-juden-vergast-worden-sind/ ), 
   simply being skeptic is out of the question , it must be some underlying undiscovered hate somewhere . 
  this is simply untrue . 
  german judges went through each and every argument holocaust deniers could come up with . 
  a single judge who was fed up with this argument spent months hearing out all the `` evidence '' the defendant came up with . 
  there were trials were chemistry ( or history or even architecture ) professors were invited as expert witness because someone came up with the idea that because there are no residuals of zyklon b in the gas chambers the holocaust is not real . 
  ** german judges do not handout these sentences just like that . 
  every argument holocaust deniers came up with in their trials has been fairly reviewd by independent experts . 
  people do n't get mercilessly sentened by an orwellian state . 
  her husband was a pretty diligent bureaucrat in the ss until himmler personally threw him out and told him he has not the slightest bit of disciplin or human decency . 
  after the war he was trying to restore `` actual history '' until he died . 
  she is just following his footsteps and belongs to the type of people that actually believes her f\u00fchrer was such a great human being that he could have never done such crimes . 
  yet she still hates jews . 
  she is also one of the few contemporary revisionists that actually lived during that time and has some very international fan clubs for this reason .

  unlike the us government we at least do n't kill our citizens with drone strikes when they say bad things . 
  anwar al-awlaki was just an american that preached some hateful things and yet your government killed him . 
  but hey it was a legal drone strike so how can that be bad .

  some fun facts about this old lady and her views : * she says you can not trust historians that do research on the holocaust because they were n't alive back then . 
  * you can only trust germans that were alive back then . 
  not germans that confirm the holocaust actually happened though because they are liars . 
  * you can especially not trust jews that survied the holocaust because the jews are notorious liars . 
  * basically you can only trust germans that were alive back then and deny the holocaust . 
  * therefore if you only trust germans that deny the holocaust and were alive when it happened you will find a 100 % consent that the holocaust did n't happen . 
  not even kim jong-un gets such results in the elections . 
  * the holocaust could n't have happened because zyklon b can not be real . 
  she actually sent a letter to the german central jewish council asking `` where are those 6 million jews killed by zklon b ? 
  show me ! '', 
  ( 6 million is the total number not the number killed by gas ) * she has warned german jews to not interfere with german politics because it is not their country . 
  * she told german jews to go back to the far east . 
  ( why the far east ? 
  nobody knows ) * ** she has warned german jews there would be another pogrom ( not another holocaust because that one obviously did n't happen ) if they do n't stop interfering with german matters . 
  ** +10 points to slytherin for this well nuanced phrasing . 
  she is not threatening them nor explicitly denying the holocaust only concerned about their well being . 
  therefore entirely legal in germany . 
  for decades she said shit like that without being bothered much by the state . 
  then a german tv channel did an interview with here that checked all the boxes neccessary for a conviction . 
  tldr : she has the same intellect as every other holocaust denier . 
  most awkward discussion to a beautiful landscape photo . 
   you need a written consent from the parent to take their kid anywhere outside the school ( at least you should need one ) you need consent ... well maybe you do n't ... but you should . 
  i mean what kind of nanny state do you want to live in where parents need to micro manage every single school trip ? 
   while `` concessions to the u.k. in detail must n't be a taboo , '' the `` four basic freedoms are , however , indispensable , '', 
  i mean they do , especially italians and greeks . 
  so the age of consent in your country is 18 ? 
  well , actually the age of consent in germany matters not the uk :  the age of consent in germany is 14 , as long as a person over the age of 21 does not exploit a 14 - to 15-year-old person 's lack of capacity for sexual self-determination , in which case a conviction of an individual over the age of 21 requires a complaint from the younger individual ; being over 21 and engaging in sexual relations with a minor of that age does not constitute an offense by itself . 
   the czech family act sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 years for both sexes , although courts may exceptionally allow minors over 16 years to enter into marriage .1 according to the czech statistical office , twelve 16 year old females , nineteen 17 year oldfemales and one 17 year old male were married for the first time in 2012 .
