  we are a product of our enviroment , so we are germany and germany is us . 
  i sure as shit wo n't just leave everything i am and everyone i know behind to save my sorry ass . 
  especially with the reasoning `` it 's just impossible to love this country '' . 
  if you ca n't find anything to love here , it 's probably time to move on . 
  oh yeah arte , the only channel in germany that is watchable without getting braincancer .

  a reasonable assessment, 
  jesus i ca n't remember the last time i read a more one-dimensional propaganda piece . 
  funded by soros i suppose . 
  40 minutes of zizek is just impossible .

  amazingly done you fucking right-wing morons ... 
  til there 's basically a swastika gang sign . 
  it 's even done the right direction , which is surprisingly rare - but you need to tilt it by 45 \u00b0 mr polish guy !, 
  well yes , but is n't that the whole point of trump ? 
  a middle finger to the political establishment , the people would rather see a joke rule than the fucking devil . 
  the guy that designed that thing is a real genius . 
  it was supposed to guard our main food source in case we push the button and end civilization . 
  as it turns out this thing ca n't handle the obvious outcomes of climate change ... humanity is fucked . 
  gundams when ? 
  let 's do it boys !, 
  how do you do it italy ? 
  with all that deliciousness ?

  yea well the uk is just god mode in this case . 
  pink floyd ... how could one top that ? 
  what are you trying to tell me ? 
  are you okay with manipulating votes ? 
  if you manipulate a vote , do n't you think that manipulating it into 0,0 % is a bit too much ? 
  amateurs . 
  also : we 're protecting our democracy by shitting on democracy . 
  well done . 
  ... and the german ones are a tank and a shitty joke . 
  it 's spelled k a m p f k o l o s s, 
  so when google ... sorry i meant to say skynet takes over , all we have to do is communicate in complex long compound nouns . 
  got it !, 
  bacteria that produce b12 occur naturally in the stomach of ruminants . 
  learn to read . 
  but whatever , i 've had enough . 
  believe what you want . 
   b12 is produced in nature only by prokaryotes in the form of certain bacteria and archaea ; it is not made by any multicellular or single-celled eukaryotes . 
  [ 24 ] [ 25 ] it is synthesized by some gut bacteria in humans and other animals , but humans can not absorb the b12 made in their guts , as it is made in the colon which is too far from the small intestine , where absorption of b12 occurs . 
  [ 26 ] ruminants , such as cows and sheep , absorb b12 produced by bacteria in their guts . 
  [ 26 ] for gut bacteria of ruminants to produce b12 the animal must consume sufficient amounts of cobalt . 
  [ 27 ] grazing animals pick up b12 and bacteria that produce it from the soil at the roots of the plants they eat . 
  googled it . 
  any site making the point you 're trying to make is some vegan lifestyle garbage . 
  so i posted the well sourced , scientifically sound wikipedia article . 
  i get b12 from eating animals . 
  as it turns out , you can also get it from eating shit . 
  go and do that , will ya ? 
  hard to do when they are pouring oil into the fire . 
  human nature is stuffing absolutely anything into your mouth that does not kill you . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  vitamin b12 is produced by bacteria that exist inside the digestive tracts of animals . 
  yea see that 's a prime example of the `` vegan '' attitude ? 
   why do cows produce milk and when do they produce it ? 
  i hope you realize that it is the same reason humans do no , obviously i do n't , because i do n't have second grade education ... 
  i just do not care . 
  neither does the cow , all she cares about is eating and reproducing . 
  the industrializing of the food chain you describe ( be it ethical or not ) is just a product of humans beign the apex predator on earth . 
  it 's nothing but a ultra highly developed version of a lion tearing out a zebra 's jugular . 
  it may be inhumane but so is nature itself . 
  chickens eat each other , pigs eat shit ( and basically absolutely anything including each other ) , hyenas eat their prey alive because that 's the most fresh meat possible . 
  do n't justify it by saying we do n't need to be omnivores anymore because we also do n't war with each other anymore . 
  that 's incomparable . 
  one thing is natural , the other is not . 
  killing would be more comparable . 
  it 's also something that will never stop . 
  just like we 'll never stop eating like the omnivores we are . 
  you need to supplement your diet through artificial means and that is everything that stands between you and malnourisment . 
  so as free as you are to eat whatever you want , i 'm free to call veganism for what it is : a new age fad that exists because a whole industry supports it with artificial supplements . 
  just like anti vaxers that only exist because herd immunity protects them . 
  just like homeopathy that only exists because once the sugar pills fail , real medicine swoops in to save the day - or in the case of the poor child this thread is about ... yea well , the child payed the price for the parents idiocy . 
  you mean ... like pandas ? 
  we have the good nutella ... 
  i 'm anti vegan . 
  i can see the ethical point in beign a vegetarian . 
  i do n't see the point veganism . 
  it 's not healthy and it goes against human nature . 
  the cow does n't care about the milk and neither does the chicken care about its eggs .
