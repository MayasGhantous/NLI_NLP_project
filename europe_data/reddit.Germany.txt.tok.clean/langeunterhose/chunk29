  as a matter of fact , chicken eat their own eggs . 
  humans are omnivores for a reason . 
  not eating any animal products at all is going to have it 's consequences . 
  not eating any animal products is going to end in a massive vitamin b deficiency , which is extremely unhealthy . 
  in females it also often leads into a perpetual state of anemia . 
  so have fun eating pills for the rest of your life . 
  the holier and smarter than though attitude is just the icing on the cake . 
  no , not feeling it at all . 
  it 's unhealthy and unnatural . 
  so czechia , now that were are confirmed brothers ... anschluss maybe ? 
  fair enough then . 
  would n't have been a surprise though if they were against human milk too . 
   for many people around 1 % of people have celtiac disease . 
  for most of these people that means they get a lot of farts going with certain types of food . 
  if you have a real intolerance life is going to suck big time . 
  most people that claim they are gluten intolerant are pulling it ouf of their ass because it 's the newest fad . 
  there 's a reason that it 's mostly vegan stickfigures that keep on japping about gluten . 
  i was 4,4 at birth ... 
  oh so vegans are against human milk too ?? 
  til . 
  the stupidity knows no bounds . 
  they are taunting us to do so . 
  `` nazis '' and of course `` germany allies itself with coup instigators , but powerful turkey will make them pay ! '', 
  i do n't know , youth unemployment is pretty high in spain , but judging from this article she does seem pretty lazy and i would n't want to have to pay for her lazy ass either . 
  looks like she needs a reality check . 
  watch out brigitte , this love story is about to take off . 
  good . 
  no need to waste money on developing a new plane . 
  just buy american , they sure know how build jetplanes and it 's a state of the art one . 
  i welcome if we buy a fleet of them . 
   criminal market manipulation he 's qualified for the job then, 
  human rights for gays in chechnya ? 
  what is that supposed to be . 
  there 's nothing to debate . 
  they obviously opress and probably kill gay men - and we will not do anything about it other than standing in front of a camera to tell the world that it 's not okay ... 
  while stereotypes do not all apply to all people , there 's certainly some truth to them . 
  otherwise they would n't be stereotypes . 
   mechanical , drink beer all day , born with a monkey wrench in their hands , eating vast quantities of sausage and sauerkraut , loathe inefficiency , love the fatherland , have never been late for anything in their lives , and would ~ ~ secretly ~ ~ like to invade europe . 
  yeah that 's me alright ... 
  that 's probably because while erdogan has a big mouth in public , he probably strokes trump 's ego in such meeting to no end . 
  the exact opposite with merkel . 
  just look at the pictures from their meeting . 
  merkel looking directly at him while trump looks on the floor , like a beaten dog :d, 
  so a lot of people on that blocklist were basically guilty of wrongthink ? 
  now i understand and like the idea of just randomly having someone manage that account . 
  but the fact that they kept the blocklist that was created by a completely mental extremist sounds like you might have a problem , sweden ... 
  placebos do n't finance gurus that potentially kill people with their faux science . 
  aside from the fact that they are very very rarely prescribed . 
  especially not for a cold . 
  homeopathy is most definitely not cheaper than generic placebos . 
  take a look at what a bottle of globuli goes for on amazon . 
  doctors should , in my opinion , refuse to prescribe medicine for a common cold unless it 's getting to the point where the infection becomes dangeorus for the person or the person runs the risk of infecting weak , old or very young people . 
  people demanding medicine for a cold and get their way too ( be it in the form of homepathy or something else ) is only fueling the infantilization in our societies . 
  the medicine they need is someone telling them that ** do n't need medicine ** . 
  if they want painkillers they can buy them themselves . 
  i 'll happily pay for other 's medical care , but not for some adult baby that ca n't handle feeling unwell . 
  the difference between placebo and homeopathy is that people do n't attribute non-scientific properties to placebo . 
  a placebo is just that : a generic sugarpill that tricks people into a positive mindset and can , in some cases , help people overcome illness . 
  homeopathy is a pseudoscience with a whole industry of charlatan gurus behind it . 
  i 'll gladly finance placebos with my insurance but not homeopathy . 
  if my provider ever decides to finance this degeneracy , i 'll switch to one who does n't . 
  dude , homeopathy was invented in germany . 
  you bet your ass we have our share of crazies . 
  i 've argued with people that have academic degrees about fruitarianism because they thought it 's the most super duper magic diet when in reality ... it kills you . 
  needless to say the fruity looked like a wet noodle and a reasonably strong men could probably rip her arms out . 
  so yeah , we have our fair share of morons ( see the whole migration conundrum ) and surprisingly it seems rather rare that they are from the less educated class of people . 
  yeah it 's what happens when you put people in charge that have a weak grip on reality . 
  we have health insurances that pay for homeopathy for example . 
  probably the same people that are anti vax ... 
  good on you italy , should be compulsory everywhere . 
  risking herd immunity because some morons are so dumb that it boggles my mind how they managed to reproduce , is unacceptable . 
  if they 'd only kill their own spawn - fine , but it 'll eventually kill the children of respectable humans . 
   crossbow and ** arrow ** triggered, 
  i wish i could go . 
  would love to see this thing . 
  this may be the machine that makes cern pale in comparision . 
  so we 're back to this childish game ? 
  pull the soldiers from there , find someplace else please angie . 
   politically conscious carneval you might say what he did was extremely `` politically conscious '' i think you meant politically correct . 
  which is an oxymoron when used in the context of humor . 
  they 're drunk and hyped . 
  it 's a great joke but it 's not a show of deep rooted nazism . 
  you could do the same in england . 
  i only frequent shops that make their own kebab . 
  my favorite uses only nice fatty marinated veal . 
  they do n't even throw ground beef on it . 
  as soon as the meat looks homogenous ( no different layers ) i do n't even bother buying anymore . 
  to be fair , most kebab shops ( especially in berlin ) are absolute trash . 
  in my city there 's exactly 3 good kebab dealers , one of which is a arab restaurant that also happens to sling d\u00f6ner . 
  most of the shops sell you trash tier food , convenience products and bread that tastes like i image a old sock would . 
  if parachuting a tank becomes a common thing , i want in !, 
  sounds like the coolest thing there is , could only be better if one could already shoot while freefalling . 
  italy 's nothing but sneks . 
  now you know which people to avoid . 
  germany stronk and numerous !, 
  yea so do i. 
  while most people are peaceful enough there is still need for permanent police presence in our street and the old ladies that live on my block are scared , even my wife does n't go out at night without me or our doggy . 
  this is unacceptable . 
  helping people is without question the right thing - until you jeopardize your own safety for it . 
  which we 've been doing the last years .
