  more towards the north right ? 
  i do n't think it 's a big thing in the south , but that might just be me . 
  never had it . 
  does the water in the taps always have the same temperature ? 
  the most [ basic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/standardmodell_mit_butter,_wurst_und_zwei_scheiben_brot.jpg ) type of sandwich is just bread and some sort of sausage , cold cut or cheese ( with butter if you want ) . 
  [ breadroles ] ( https://www.dingdong24.de/images/dbimages/artikel_0000229_b_1.jpg ) with more toppings are popular snacks from bakeries . 
  very popular in my region , bavaria , are also the following sandwiches ( i do n't know how much they get eaten in the rest of germany ) : - [ bread with butter and chives ] ( http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/4586381201_a45ea98ac5.jpg ) - [ leberk\u00e4ssemmel . 
  ] ( http://www.kulinarium-austria.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sagen-sie-doch-einfach-leberk%c3%a4se-zu-ihm-%c3%9cber-die-tradition-des-leberk%c3%a4ses.2.jpg ) leberk\u00e4s is a type of meat paste that get 's baked in the oven . 
  it 's an ** extremely ** popular dish here . 
  i know loads of people that eat one every day for lunch . 
  - [ pretzel with butter . 
  ] ( http://static.zoonar.com/img/www_repository3/46/41/c5/10_7bc3fafc1c0417b70970357078e6c8a8.jpg ) also popular with chives . 
  yes !, 
  i 've been meaning to cook that ever since i came back to germany , but i still have n't gotten around to it . 
  that 's good . 
  you can never have too many potential food options . 
  i 'd imagine it would look much the same just with everything pushed a couple of hours later :d all the people i worked for ( only 6 in total so take that with a grain of salt ) had a schedule looking something like that : 7:30 -8 am : wake up , drink coffee , not really eat anything except some biscuits 8:30 -9 am : bring kids to school , go to work 11am : have morning snack 2-3pm : have lunch 6-7pm : leave work 9-11pm : have dinner 1-2am : go to bed, 
  i mean you 'd also eat a super late lunch , so likely you would n't be hungry again by then . 
  and i think generally a lot of spaniards do n't finish work that early anyway . 
  at least most i knew while living there did n't . 
  there is also an afternoon snack called `` merienda '' that takes place at around 6ish . 
  i 'm not sure what adults eat for that as i was working as an au pair and always watched the kids during that time . 
  they usually got stuff like a small sandwich , something from the bakery , a yoghurt or some biscuits . 
  i 'd imagine adults would also eat something like that . 
  i loved spain for that reason . 
  i like having late dinners , but in germany everything closes super early . 
  you could n't get a meal anywhere in my city after 10pm unless you went to mcdonald 's or a kebab shop . 
  not yet , but it 's a city i 've always wanted to go to . 
  i do n't think recipes are copyrighted , but there are geografical protections that go further than just country of origin . 
  foods that are protected that way can be produced elsewhere , but then ca n't carry the same name . 
  in germany for example a type of gingerbread ( lebkuchen in german ) from nuremberg is really famous , but it is n't allowed to be called nuremberg lebkuchen unless it is actually made in nuremberg . 
  people know what 's in haggis , but do n't know what 's in sausages . 
  that 's probably the difference . 
  honestly that sounds pretty good . 
  with the gravy at least , do n't know about the garlic sauce . 
  we just call it pfannkuchensuppe , but there is nothing better than that . 
  that 's the one thing i always want my mum to make when i 'm sick . 
  we have something like that as well , but other stuff like pickles are also put in . 
  it 's called [ s\u00fclze . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/bratens%c3%bclze.jpg/1024px-bratens%c3%bclze.jpg ), 
  you 're doing something right . 
  i also had pig cheek while living in spain which i think is eaten sometimes in germany as well , but is n't very common . 
  that might have actually been the best think i 've ever eaten in my entire life . 
  i had fried pig ears in spain a couple of times . 
  extremely delicious , but not something i ever thought i would enjoy . 
  i 've never met a burschenschaftler that was n't a dickhead . 
   antoine griezmann sends his regards though . 
   traditionally they used to offer latin and ancient greek as well and many still do ( latin at least ) , but pretty much nobody takes ancient greek and latin has been getting really unpopular in the last few years and is getting replaced by spanish more and more . 
   in dutch gymnasia latin and/or ancient greek is mandatory . 
  else , it would n't be a gymnasium . 
   that 's how it was like here as well in the past . 
  you also needed latin to be allowed to study loads of subjects in university , but nowaday i think it 's only still required for theology . 
  german , english , spanish and french in order of ability . 
  i also had latin lessons in school . 
  in gymnasien ( the type of school that allows you to go on to universities afterwards ) the most common languages nowadays are english , french and spanish . 
  traditionally they used to offer latin and ancient greek as well and many still do ( latin at least ) , but pretty much nobody takes ancient greek and latin has been getting really unpopular in the last few years and is getting replaced by spanish more and more . 
  some schools might also offer chinese , italian , russian , japanese , greek , polish , portuguese , czech and turkish , but those are really uncommon . 
  i think schools in other federal states also offers dutch and danish for the regions close to the border , but my state does n't offer them . 
  not that many . 
  london , berlin , madrid , prague and edinburgh , if you want to count that . 
  i want to go to lissabon in the next couple of weeks and i also definitely want to go to dublin , warsaw , bratislava , budapest and ljubljana . 
  do you also do a day of french-german friendship in schools ? 
  that was always one of my favourite days of the year because we got to do nothing but chill and eat crepes . 
  i do n't drink soda , only water , but it 's usually served in a 0,4-0 ,5 l glass . 
  that 's enough for one meal . 
  i still want to actually be able to fit the food in . 
  i wouldnt be surprised if seehofer sometimes dreamt about integrating austria , seceding from germany and appointing himself the king of the new empire . 
  so all those school exchanges were useful after all . 
  the first time i travelled at all was when i was 6 with my family . 
  we went to crete . 
  i do n't remember much , only that i had a great time . 
  the first time i travelled on my own was when i was 18 . 
  i went to scotland for a week and to london for a week and a bit . 
  it was awesome !, 
  i saw so many cool things and met a lot of nice people some of which i 'm still in contact with nowadays . 
  some people prefer city trips over seeing the countryside . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  i do think there is definitely some truth to the saying . 
  after high school i spent a while in spain as an au pair where i met a lot of american and other european girls and there definitely was a difference in attitude towards distances . 
  most girls usually had some days of on the weekend and would travel . 
  all the europeans would only go to nearby towns and cities , maybe at most 3 hours away . 
  all the americans would travel much farther because `` it 's only a 8 hour bus ride '' . 
  all of us europeans would save the farther away places for long weekends or the holidays which was when the americans would go all over europe . 
  i responded yes to 2 nonwords ( although neagled does sound like it should mean drunk in britain ) and did n't know 8 actual words . 
  the test definitely checks more the passive vocabulary than the active one . 
  i would understand all of the words i responded yes to if i saw them written down or heard them in conversation , but i probably would n't use some of them of my own accord . 
  the sourcream and onion chips from ikea . 
  [ hmbc - vo mello bis ge schoppornou ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmi2m06yffc ) i also think is really beautiful . 
  it 's still like that in bavaria , they just renamed hauptschule to mittelschule . 
  other federal states might have different systems . 
  yeah , i 'm sure they 're around , but i do n't know anyone that has a gas oven . 
  all the new houses have electric and all the old houses who still do n't have electric have wood ovens . 
  i 'm a student . 
  i have around 700 $ / month coming in through various sources . 
  one of those is baf\u00f6g which is a type of governmental help for students . 
  students who 's parents make little money can apply for it and then you get some money every month . 
  half of it has to be paid back , but only up to 10000 $ . 
  through that i 'm about 1800 $ in debt at the moment which will probably be around 7200 $ by the time i graduate . 
  i 've never seen a gas oven anywhere here . 
  kind of both .
