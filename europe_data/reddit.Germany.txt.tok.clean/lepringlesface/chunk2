  i sometimes feel like people here forget that the democratic process is n't their personal echo chamber and that people with differing opinions are worth exactly the same and should be worth exactly the same . 
  you ca n't just keep people from voting because they do n't share your opinion . 
  it does n't work that way . 
  edit : clarified, 
  i like it, 
  ahahaha i ca n't get enough of butthurt leftists . 
  it was a criminal , violent and highly aggressive mob . 
  they destroyed several dozen police cars , injured more than hundred policemen and caused a physical damage likely in the millions . 
  why ? 
  because they should be removed from a house which they illegally occupied for 24 years . 
  this one police man changes nothing and if you really do defend that scum i 'd almost wish you 'd get a fucking stone crushed unto your head . 
  they do n't just do it for shit and giggles . 
  leftist anarchists were tolerated far too long in hamburg leading to an outbreak of violence where several policemen were in some cases severely hurt . 
  also the weeks before innocent policemen were ambushed and similar . 
  this is a signal that the police wo n't put up with their bullshit any longer because those groups became too self confident . 
  a shot across the bows so to say . 
  oh god i misread that title horribly, 
   david cameron 's internet porn filter is the start of censorship creep no shit , sherlock . 
  ^ ^ but ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ still ^ ^ an ^ ^ important ^ ^ topic . 
  ^ ^ media ^ ^ must ^ ^ not ^ ^ stop ^ ^ reporting ^ ^ about ^ ^ it . 
   could you at least care to elaborate about who is `` we '' exactly ? 
  could you please look at the graph in the op ? 
   do at least some explaining , before calling everyone else an ignorant . 
  why should i if it 's pointless eitherway ? 
   so it seems you already know your theories/explanations are racist before even allowing us to judge them as such or not . 
  i * know * they are not , but if you 'd take a minute and read the res of this thread you 'd know why i do n't bother explaining further . 
  the newest entry is just reciting an essay by someone else . 
  you sure are talented in giving absolutely unrelated and irrelevant responses . 
   http://energyskeptic.com/ lol . 
  read my post and take your hippiebullshit somewhere else . 
   cultures are dying out constantly . 
  there are constanly wars being waged as well and i suppose you still would n't find a war in your country very pleasing . 
   you would probably get a huge culture shock if you were thrown back in time just one or two generations from when you were born . 
  which has absolutely nothing to do with what i wrote . 
  jesus fuck , what is wrong with you ? 
  i said we 're dying out and for you that somehow means i 'm in the edl and talk about europeans as a master race ? 
  way to overact . 
  stop seeing fucking ghosts . 
  and btw . 
  this  there will always be less births during austere times , and more during expanding growth . 
  is absolute bullshit as well . 
  you have absolutely no idea what you 're talking about . 
  simply put : because we are * dying out * edit : a shoutout to all the retards arguing with `` overpopulation '' here . 
  europe is n't the region overpopulationg the earth . 
  [ asia is and africa will be ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/un_desa_continent_population_1950_to_2100.svg/512px-un_desa_continent_population_1950_to_2100.svg.png ) . 
  so if you have problems with overpopulation you better start supporting eugenics right now . 
  i * could * explain you the economical and very global implications a population decline in europe has , but since everything i 'd get as an answer would be several shades of insults and explanations of how racist i am , i 'd better dont . 
  a friendly piece of advice : get some fucking education before you loudly voice your opinion about themes you know jackshit about . 
  you 're just embarrassing yourselves, 
  i 'd rather not . 
  sperm donors can be sued for alimonies here . 
  edit : but i sure do plan to get a fuckton of children, 
  are you serious ? 
  italy has it better , yes , but only [ by a small margin ] ( http://www.google.de/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:deu:ita&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=de&amp;dl=de&amp;ind=false ), 
  i * am * part italian . 
  this hurts so fucking much to look at, 
  back to / r/atheism you go, 
  i thought you meant it the other way around ( as in that article itself is shit because it 's prejudiced/racist/whatever ), 
  care to explain why you think the article is `` bad '' ? 
  all the people are complaining that the state backs off from those shariah courts undermining our civil right system . 
  are you actually okay with that or what ? 
  sshhh - saying something like this is racist . 
  do you want to be a racist ? 
  ouch . . 
  i 'm actually cool with ( most ) european immigrants . 
  they usually integrate rather well in comparison to their non-european ( meaning muslim ) counterparts . 
  on a sidenote : the graph is rather misleading . 
  take a look at the absolute numbers . 
   thousands of economic refugees flood into berlin every year funfact : asylum requests based on economic reasons ( so-called `` wirtschaftsfl\u00fcchtlinge '' ) are not valid and get rejected very quickly . 
  fortunately , thanks to the eu , these poor fellas get a second chance and can freely migrate to the richer countries where they finally get all the free money and shelter they need . 
  i 'm proud . 
  good on you austria . 
  i applaud you on that . 
  in other news : polls show afd in germany now at 6 % . 
  everything goes better than expected . 
  a dynamic limit is an interesting idea indeed . 
  or what comes to my mind would be a party limit rather than a percentage hurdle . 
  for example : each year the 6 or 7 biggest parties enter the parliament independently of their result . 
  when you come to a situation where over 16 % of the voters are n't represented in the parliament in any way , you might want to reconsider your electoral system . 
  imo , a threshold as high as this is a crime . 
  i can understand that you do n't want every fringe party in the parliament but i think a limit of 3,5 % would be sufficient . 
  who else ? 
  horses ? 
   anti-eu wrong  dropping the euro and having an own currency again wrong and then you whine about populism ... 
  i hope they drop well under 10 % . 
  better even under 5 % . 
  basically because the economy never really recovered from soviet occupation . 
  and the constant stream of people towards the west since even before the wall came down does n't exactly help to better that . 
  i am actually moving from south to east germany in a few weeks . 
  ( btw . 
  berlin does n't count as east germany in this equation ), 
   east germany is almost completely gone . 
  more like  east germany is almost completely empty . 
  because , you know , everyone wants to get the fuck out of there . 
  they maybe were once somewhen between the last bundestagswahl and this one but today they are nothing but a far left feminist party with a focus on twitter . 
  on top of that their politicians do n't know what they 're talking about and are destroyed in pretty much every debate . 
  put a bit of embarrassment inducing actions now and then into the mix and you have an obsolete party that wo n't get elected again . 
   being butthurt about 4 words remove yourself from the internet . 
   pirate party good joke, 
  yeah , nobody knows him .
