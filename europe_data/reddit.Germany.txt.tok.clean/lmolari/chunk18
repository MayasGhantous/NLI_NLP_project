  if polands sends 70 million young dudes to uk to let them vote if uk should become a part of poland , how do you think the votes will end ? 
  the same with mallorca . 
  if there would be a vote if it should become an german island i 'm sure germay would win . 
  i support the eu in cause of its achievements , not because i feel european . 
  i do not even want to know what this abstract term could mean because its just another try to get into my mind . 
  i could say i feel franconian . 
  but even that would make me think if liking local specialities , drinking local beer , knowing some people , knowing the surrounding countryside and talking a certain dialect should make me feel different then any person on earth who basically has the same feelings for their region . 
  if most people feel like that for the region they are born , what kind of value has this feeling then ? 
  seems to be pretty redundant . 
  on top of that lingers the fact that it seems to be some kind of evolutionary , genetic thing to like the region you come from . 
  so obviously the biggest reason to go to war - `` patriotism '' - is just a super simple feeling that evolution planted into your `` heart '' , because natural selection made clear that more of us survive if we stay in the `` biome '' our parents lived in . 
  then is ask myself : how many wars have been fought because people are not able to overcome just another primitive instinct ? 
  as far as i remember those things `` greece has done '' were imposed on greece only 2-3 years ago . 
  not 2008 . 
  so either you are lying or you got your facts wrong . 
  it think it 's the first . 
   divisive i 'm not sure if i can be any more divisive then brexit , because that 's the very nature of this whole `` thing '' . 
   relations with the uk do n't have to go south . 
  why are you pushing that they do ? 
  i 'm pushing to not be naive and to get into that boat before we even know if it was putins fault that this sarin gas attack happened . 
  if that means that the relations go south its ok for me . 
  i 'm not sure if it can get much worse then at the moment anyway . 
  in case you had n't notice : the british government is a danger for the eu right now . 
  it consists basically of anti-eu populists , who try to get trump to fall in love with them . 
  just another anti-eu-populist . 
  in my opinion they would be very happy if the eu would disintegrate into nothing . 
  why ? 
  because it would only help them in everything they are caring about right now . 
  we have to face the fact they they are a danger for the eu , even bigger then putin . 
  at first i asked my self . . how could he know that it 's breakfast . 
  there is a long drink on the table . 
  but then i checked the position of the sun . 
  i think it 's around 10:00 in the morning . 
  so you are right !, 
  chips for breakfast !, 
  barbarians !, 
   you feel betrayed by brexit and now just wan na take the opposite stance of the uk in everything is it ? 
  i did n't say we should take the opposite stance by default . 
  if it 's according to our own values : lets go with it . 
  that does n't mean we should take their opinion as a reliable source of good advice . 
  it means that we should look on everything the british government is saying to determine what they are up to and then basically ignore it , to go on following our own values . 
  if it results in the same outcome : good !, 
  if not : who cares ? 
  but they are changing its position . 
  sorry , but threatening putin directly and trying to get everyone else in the boat - even if it 's still not clear who used those weapons - is a changed position . 
  i want to say it as clear as possible , so i rephrase it : ** especially ** because it is still unclear if the gas was used by rebels or assad this quick move to threaten putin looks ** very ** suspicious . 
  but even trump did not directly threaten putin . 
  its a very cheap attempt to use the general hate against chemical warfare and the killing of innocents for his own political targets . 
  just think about the implications if you do n't jump on the hate train . 
  `` all those cute little babies . 
  and you do n't want to retaliate them ? '', 
   ah , so the uk has no more political weight than liberia . 
  i did not say that . 
  to make it clear : i 'm talking about the value of their opinion for the rest of europe . 
  not of their political weight . 
  if someone is working against you , you should listen to this opinion and then ask yourself `` why is he saying that '' ? 
  seriously . 
  putin has much political weight . 
  but how important do you think should his opinion be for britain ? 
   he 's responded to the use of chemical weapons , as have many other european leaders . 
  it is n't some great conspiracy for brexit negotiations . 
  you are right . 
  it 's indeed no `` great '' conspiracy . 
  its pretty stupid and obvious what he is up to . 
  and to counter that `` many other leaders '' argument : the other leaders supported trump but said nothing relevant to threaten putin . 
  a very important difference . 
  `` opinion = meaningful '' and `` opinion = does not matter '' are the two extremes in this case . 
  it 's true : britain has a strong voice and strong allies . 
  but we are currently in negotiations with britain . 
  negotiations that are extremely important to britain . 
  and that means we have no longer the luxury of considering their advice in the same way like when we were allies . 
  because now we have to consider every single move britain does as a attempt to get a stronger negotiation-position . 
  i 'm sorry , but this also means that the value of britain 's opinion is basically devaluated to zero . 
  but he is right . 
  if liberia would say `` we '' should impose new sanctions it would be equally meaningful . 
  you may ask why and the answer is easy : because britain is currently following a agenda that is focused mostly on getting a good position during brexit . 
  and that is the reason why we should think about anything britain says and what their long term target may be . 
  and then we should consider to do the exact opposite . 
  if i 'd have to guess what boris is up to on this one i 'd say he 's working to intensify the gap between europe and russia . 
  britain wants to use `` defence for europe '' as a core part of the brexit negotiations . 
  this is much more necessary for europe if russia remains a threat to our safety . 
  we all know that russia does not react well to sanctions . 
  and if boris knows that new sanction will provoke russia more than they 're going to help us , than this could mean that boris wants to heat up our relations with russia even further to get a stronger negotiation position . 
  i do n't need to mention that this is a pretty dangerous game . 
  but playing the puppeteer also would fit into britains secret dream of becoming a global superpower again . 
  hehehe !, 
  he is calling himself a anda-lous-ian !, 
  there still is a government in syria . 
  and there is still a administration . 
  you are right when it comes to cities like aleppo , though . 
  i 'm pretty sure there is not much . 
  there are embassies and there are most certainly paid informants . 
  but what i learned from the refugee crisis is that there is n't a real network . 
  germany was n't even able to double check a persons identity if necessary ( terrorism and so on ) and officials admitted that openly . 
   the german foreign minister said on tv yesterday that there was no conclusive proof of who was responsible for the attack . 
  we need a un inquiry into the poison gas attack . 
  how could there be any for german government ? 
  they do n't trust trump , they do n't trust putin , they do n't trust assad . 
  i 'm also sure that they do n't have any kind of relevant spy network in the region . 
  so how in the world should germany be able to gather `` conclusive proof '' ?
