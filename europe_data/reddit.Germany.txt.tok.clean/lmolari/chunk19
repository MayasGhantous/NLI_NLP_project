  i 'm quite sure that they do n't have much more than twitter . 
  in my eyes this is just a lame excuse easily swallowed by the stupid masses to avoid getting their hands dirty . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that . 
  it 's a bit hard to decide which source is right . 
  everyone seems to count different . 
  so the numbers range wildly . 
  i would n't call that `` alternative history '' though . 
  the linked article is btw . 
  about the overall killing both are responsible for . 
  not only russians . 
  oh , it was just a nice way to say `` lmgtfy '' . 
  he 's just one of many , it seams . 
  guess we 've found the fan !, 
  citation from a quick googling :  dyadkin estimated that the ussr suffered 56 to 62 million `` unnatural deaths '' during that period , with 34 to 49 million directly linked to stalin . 
  in `` europe a history , '' british historian norman davies counted 50 million killed between 1924-53 , excluding wartime casualties so obviously yes . 
  he killed more russians than hitler . 
  maybe that 's why they like him so much ? 
  less clouds = more sunny hours per day . 
  lack of knowledge . 
  i also do n't understand the outcry about coal . 
  last time i looked there where very good filter systems who reduced the co \u00b2 output to nearly zero . 
  to me this sounds a little bit like lobbyism . 
  wait for 10 more years of global warming , when germany becomes the italy of europe and italy north africa . 
  very good for solar energy production !, 
  6bn price tag ? 
  sounds like a good bargain . 
  we are going to take two , please . 
  let 's make it 20bn . 
  you can keep the change . 
  that is a matter of perception . 
  you can also say if they would n't be supported by russian people he would 've been never grown to be as strong as now . 
  also : 10 years ago our government was best friend with russia . 
  the result ? 
  russia grew stronger and got cocky again . 
  now they fight a war in ukraine , try to divide europe and bombard us with a never-ending stream of fake news . 
  russia is also basically a law-free zone for any kind of internet crime against persons outside russia . 
  or to put it in the right place : the conclusion we can draw from the last 100 years of wars , cold wars and general conflict is : russia does not want to be our ally . 
  russia had the chance when putin came into power . 
  but instead of cooperation he has chosen conflict because he has to follow his inner voice who wants to yell out in the world `` russia stronk '' . 
  the sun is no newspapers so its unable to qualify for `` banning newspaper is not a good idea '' . 
  why should we light up buildings for russia if we do n't do it for so many other countries ( iraq , syria and so on ) ? 
  and those countries are not even our threat number one , like russia . 
  because you are special ? 
  light on buildings only for allies . 
  according to me its better for a country to focus on working then on complaining . 
  and do you really think your country is getting stronger in cause of complaining ? 
  is the picture of yourself some kind of beggar who gets more money if he is louder than any other beggar ? 
  or what do you think do you get from complaining . 
  free money ? 
  your rights to do what exactly ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  you are right . 
  it was so much better in the ussr . 
  or before . 
  or before . 
  or before . 
  now that you mention it : was there something historians would call a golden age in poland anytime in history ? 
  to put it in context , lets compare your well-being to similar , former ussr or eastern european countries : https://www.google.de/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:aut&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:pol:rus:deu:est:bgr:mda:hun:srb:svk:svn:cze:geo:mkd:mne&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false i 'm no expert . 
  but too me it looks like poland and other eu countries are doing much better than other former ussr satellites that are not in the eu . 
  could it be that your crying is solely based on envy and greed ? 
  because to me it sounds like instead of shutting up because you are too busy working on your future you demand that it is given to you . 
  i 'm not sure if scotland is ready for the eu , after seeing this low density northern area . 
  jean-claude will be informed about this . 
  a new eu regulation is in need . 
  we need to protect future generations from this madness, 
  we should take a close look on the dudes that prevented stronger regulations back than - because you may believe it or not , this things are voted on by the member countries and not some strange commission . 
  but i guess thats no longer relevant . 
  you do n't need to trust them , just because you put the blame in the right direction . 
  but if you put all blame on them your are irrational . 
  in my opinion the eu is n't even a real government . 
  the eu jumped in when bankrupt countries needed money and forced them into austerity . 
  sounds more like the eu acted like a normal bank , dealing with a bankrupt customer . 
  but that those countries ran bankrupt in the first place was their governments fault , because they are the one responsible . 
  but thats normally a good thing . 
  only if you are strong-willed enough to lift that rug and see the damage you 're able to repair it . 
  i did not say `` trust the eu '' or `` they made no mistakes '' . 
  so no wonder implying this makes no sense !, 
  :p i 'm saying that the problems are complex enough that the entire world is struggling to solve them . 
  there were only very few countries that came out from this crisis without too much struggle ( fun-fact : some of them are a part of the eu ) . 
  it was you who said : the eu failed at solving this . 
  and it was me like : if you look at the numbers it looks like the whole world ( overall ) failed at solving it . 
  the thing i 'm trying to imply is : ** maybe ** its an issue that can not be solved overnight like paying a bill . 
  and that would also mean : blaming the eu is simplification and therefore wrong by default !, 
  you are right . 
  i wanted to show the world unemployment statistics , not the third world only . 
  the point i was trying to make : the eu is by far not the only country that had and has problems . 
  the impact was strong and long lasting . 
   i think that is far more detrimental and what you are describing is very specific outlier and if they really worked together for 2 years they can just employ him . 
  the difference is the salary . 
  he earns 3 times more than a normal employee . 
  so i do n't blame him for not wanting to work for them on this base . 
  but this kind of crime is not only happening in germany . 
  and germany is by far not the number one in business criminality . 
  so why do you imply that germany is basically stealing this money from other countries ? 
  another user has stated that you can not prohibit that rich people want to support their children . 
  i think he is right . 
  what we need to do is to reduce the influence of money on the press and our politics . 
  we also should make it as easy as possible to create your own business . 
  money should be no problem , if you have a good idea or if you 'd be able to supply a demand . 
  i thought about it dozens of times .
