  but i think thats not as rare as you might think . 
  new refugee shelter are built everywhere . 
  my mom 's boss tried to built a huge hall for refugees in a industrial area for that sole reason . 
  its a big business . 
  * gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services - that is , those that are bought by the final user * that means gdp includes taxes . 
  so company 1 earns 1000 $ and pays 200 $ taxes . 
  gdp = 1000 $ the government pays 200 $ to company 2 to house refugees . 
  company 2 earns 200 $ including 40 $ taxes . 
  gdp = 1200 no refugees = no company 2 . 
  i might be wrong , because i 'm no expert , though . 
  this number ( 9000 $ for a 21m \u00b2 room per month alone ) is no fantasy . 
  its from an bild article . 
  the german government also made numbers public . 
  the costs for refugees were around 21 billions in 2016 . 
  and i 'm not even sure that this numbers include the spending from the cities themselves , which could be calculates as a part of their budget . 
  we are also talking about general growth . 
  that means even 0,5 % is growth . 
  1 % of greece gdp for example is 2,2 billion . 
  especially if you count in that the eu is also paying loads of money ( example : 6000 $ overall per relocation of an refugee ) and also count in donations 1-2 % of `` growth '' in greece through refugees is n't as `` vast '' as you might think . 
  a quick google search came up with an estimation of 4 billion for greece alone . 
  i 'm pretty sure the reasons are at least partially refugees . 
  when a refugee shelter gets 9000 $ for housing per refugee per month this means there are billions in circulation that are nothing but differently distributed taxes . 
  instead of this billions not being part of the economy by pumping it in some government institution they are paid to private persons . 
  that makes the economies look like they are growing while reality is that they are not . 
  this map again proves : do n't fuck with franconia !, 
   also you are wrong because `` what would your solution have been ? 
  throwing more money in the hole ? 
  nope ! '', 
  thats exactly what they did , embarrassing to think otherwise . 
  sorry , i had the impression you complained about not giving more money to the banks . 
  is n't that exactly the definition of not throwing more money into the hole ? 
  thats a different angle on the same thing . 
  greece wanted money from outside . 
  the money was offered with a harsh condition . 
  greece did n't accept the condition . 
  no money was given . 
  the question is : why did greece need money ? 
  and why did the guys who are able to give the money hesitate to give it to greece ? 
  the answer is easy : because greece was a bottomless hole . 
  they have thrown money at greece for years . 
  fucking shitloads of money . 
  at first conditionless . 
  later with conditions that were accepted but not fulfilled . 
  multiple times . 
  and then happened what we saw . 
  what would your solution have been ? 
  throwing more money in the hole ? 
  nope !, 
  please get rid of this picture in your mind . 
  a normal bank is not a `` piggy bank '' where you put your money in and take it out when you need it . 
  reality was ( with this analogy ) : your piggy bank was robbed long ago and when you tried to crush it there was nothing in it . 
  then you blamed germany for not filling the piggy bank again . 
  you should have added `` bankrupt '' before those banks . 
  it was n't germany 's fault they were bankrupt in the first place . 
  maybe some of those wannabe victims like you would ask themselves : `` how can somebody shut down a bankrupt bank ? 
   long-term economic reports are like prophecies . 
  they are like a prophecy someone paid to hear . 
  and if 5 % of the listeners believe it , he has already won . 
  don quijotes struggle was nothing like fighting such bullshit . 
  fake news !, 
  i never met a person i germany who did that , beside children . 
  they - for some strange reason - like noodles with ketchup . 
  those numbers create a interesting impression , compared to wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i_casualties intentional ? 
  merkel is a introvert rationalist and has the classic character of a scientist and often has problems to get in the minds of `` normal '' people . 
  so i guess she could have used other formulations . 
  nonetheless had this simple sentence a very complex context . 
  is it really her fault that the british press takes some words out of a context where merkel basically said the opposite then `` we take them all '' ? 
  yes , we can talk about this forever . 
  `` she should be careful what he says '' and so on . 
  in my opinion that sounds nice , but is actually nearly impossible . 
  it was one sentence out of context from of a very long speech she said something completely different . 
  next time we see : merkel : `` good day , mr. trump '' foxnews : `` merkel addresses our president with very much respect ! '', 
  journalism has a responsibility , too . 
  i got in so many discussions about this `` mishandling '' that i 'm too tired to start another one . 
  there is clear proof that this `` mishandling '' is just another piece of propaganda . 
  if you want to read more , you 're welcome : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ to sum it up : 1 . 
  german law says : halp refugees !, 
  the moment they crossed our borders we had to help . 
  merkel never sent an invitation , this was an invention by the british press . 
  the only `` mistake '' merkel made was to not sent them back to syria , because that would 've be the only place that would n't have resisted ( and would be against the law ) . 
  everyone else - for example other muslim countries - did not want them . 
  t for me as a german the fault was made by the british press , who loves to play with peoples lifes without thinking twice about it . 
  i just say `` mama merkel '' . 
  yeah , quality of life comes from prioritizing things you want to do over the things you 're not interested in . 
  or to avoid a discussion with a person who is unable to change their view on anything like this , anyway . 
  would be a waste of time anyway . 
  the uk , spain and italy are the most unequal countries . 
  i do not wonder about italy and spain , they have some problems at the moment . 
  but the uk 's economy seemed pretty strong lately . 
  should n't all parts of the country profit from this development ? 
  well , that escalated quickly !, 
   or are you just parrotting something you read on some site with dubious info ? 
  how could i , when it is you who decides what is dubious and what not , making the whole discussion useless . 
  i guess we just have to life with the fact that everybody is making their own truth in these strange days . 
  we are in the post-truth-age now , is n't it ? 
   ukraine was not about to enter the eu at all . 
  the eu offered a not-so-good trade deal and russia offered a better one . 
  the imf even said yanukovich was right to choose the russian one . 
  thousands were killed because the west decided once again to stir up a `` spontaneous revolution '' against a twice-elected president . 
  has n't it become a historic fact in the meantime that yanukovich was a russian puppet ?
