  and then the company calls this money debt !, 
  would n't this be strange ? 
  so bulgarians and turks have superior protection compared to polish people , in poland ? 
  what does protection mean in this context ? 
  you mean there is a law especially for crimes with racist motivation ? 
  does n't that also help polish people ? 
  a turk can also commit a racist crime against poles in poland . 
  i 'm also not sure if this is really some kind of protection or more of some kind of categorization mechanism . 
  nice !, 
  thank you !, 
  is this available online , for example as pdf ? 
  its classified as racist attack . 
  that 's why my post was targeted at racism in general . 
  for sure this is true if we would talk about a single person . 
  but the context is `` racism '' . 
  only extremely stupid people seem to think they are superior to someone else . 
  all others recognize that everyone seems to think this about them-self - even if its only on a subconscious level - making the base of this thought utterly useless . 
  it 's only a a remnant of evolution that helped our ancestor to survive . 
  so your idea is to fight them with ignorance and by do n't supporting them ? 
  for me that 's the reason trump won his vote . 
  instead of going to vote too much people just decided to not care . 
  the press told them : hillary will win . 
  and then trump happened . 
  the problem is that extremists vote always while people who do n't care just do n't care , for whatever reason . 
  that happen when people get aware that if they do n't care for voting , those who do will win . 
  in that case the political extremists of all sorts . 
  no , i 'm saying she is a walking calculator . 
  since most dudes are too stupid or not willing to understand an rational argument they are unable to see what merkel is doing . 
  for example : merkel cites german refugee law : press reaction : `` invitation !, 
  yay ! '', 
  over-emotional meat-sacks everywhere . 
  its ok . you got me wrong and this is over . 
  you forgot to cite the condition . 
  to fix your mistake : i think people who voted for brexit in cause of their fear of immigrants are pussies . 
  instead of being afraid and let their fear turn into hate and to vote out to let the government remove them - something that sounds very bad in my ears - they could have tried different ways , but many of them require too much courage . 
  their history seems interesting . 
  sounds like migrants nearly flooded the place from one day to another . 
  i can understand that this may make you feel very uncomfortable , especially because migrants tend to found parallel societies and do n't even try to get in touch with the locals in cause of the language barrier . 
  we are not talking about the hearts of british people . 
  we - or better - i 'm talking about cold statistics . 
  so no reason to feel insulted because you think the people you know are good people . 
  i 'm not saying the opposite . 
  also : being against migration does n't make them right wing extremists or nazis . 
  so i 'm not sure where your problem is . 
  the article sounds pretty positive about migration in boston lincolnshire . 
  :d so how did they end up voting ? 
  so you think british people are different or special in this ? 
  i 'm pretty sure - since fear of foreign people is a evolutionary instinct - this is n't the case . 
  there was a pretty explicit condition to whom i call pussy !, 
  :d nice to hear that you think half of uk voted out for migration . 
  already started to think all those statistics are made up . 
  i also tend to not believe you about the complexity of the issue . 
  most people do n't vote because they understand the complexity of the matter . 
  they vote in cause of a gut feeling . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  this does n't makes them bad people . 
  but it should make other people think if such a vote really is of use , if a big part of the voters are unable understand whats going on . 
  btw . 
  : i 've also attended a few of those anti immigrant events from the afd in germany . 
  their core message of those right wingers is always pretty simple : hate and fear , mixed in with a call to everyone to put themselves into a echo chamber by not talking to the press or reading/watching anything they publish . 
  i 'm also a software engineer . 
  and i have the impression that its pretty hard in germany to get a really high salary . 
  seems like we 're stuck at about 50-60k $ max . 
  the only way `` out '' is either you are becoming a freelancer or you become some kind of consultant . 
  or you get to be project leader . 
  but this does n't really count as `` software engineer '' anymore , because its mostly paper work . 
  you are free to `` believe '' what you want . 
  these are the statistics : ** migrants in britain : ** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11251624/where-are-the-immigrants-this-map-will-tell-you.html ** regions who voted out : ** www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/23/leave-or-remain-eu-referendum-results-and-live-maps/ ** and now some statistics about the immigration question : ** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/29/did-britain-really-vote-brexit-to-cut-immigration/ ** and last but not least , a map about right wingers in britain : ** http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11539388/mapped-where-is-ukips-support-strongest-where-there-are-no-immigrants.html https://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/immigration-top-concern-for-brexit-voters/ to conclude my `` analysis '' : 1 . 
  the regions with the least immigrants have the most right wing voters . 
  the regions who voted out have overall less migrants than the regions who voted in . 
  about 60 % of brexit voters think brexit leads to less migration . 
  migration was the main concern for brexit voters . 
  logical conclusion : migration was the top concern of brexit voters + country side tends to be more pro brexit + most right wingers live in the countryside = people living in the country side like migration less than people living in the city even if there are much less migrants than in the big cities . 
  while i do n't say its a fact , because that would be hard to proof , i think i can say ** there are strong enough tendencies in this statistics to make the assumption people who do n't have any experience with migrants dislike migration more , than people who actually know migrants . 
  ** the guardian seem to think the same : https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/voting-details-show-immigration-fears-were-paradoxical-but-decisive, 
  even in big cities there are people who are still hillbillies at heart . 
  it statistically proven . 
  not my idea . 
  just check your freely available brexit poll results . 
  first look at a map that displays the amount of migrants living in those regions . 
  and then look at a map displaying how many voted out in cause of migrants . 
   he was talking about scotland and n.ireland wanting to stay . 
  you were the one making the impression that the parts of england who voted out do not have the exactly same problem . 
  you made the impression they are very experienced with migrants , while the exact opposite is the case . 
  in regions with less migrants more people have voted out in cause of migrants . 
   that 's just silly on your part . 
  what kind of insight do you have to people living in england ? 
  nothing . 
  but i know that it 's everywhere the same psychological phenomenon . 
  just look to eastern germany . 
  people in the countryside with no contact to refugees are statistically more right wing than those living in the city , where the most migrants life . 
  and its even more of a problem if they lifed in a dictatorship and never saw a single foreign in their whole life . 
  it 's nothing but the super simple fact that people fear the unknown . 
  especially if the only thing they know about syria is isis beheabing people all day , thanks to the nice press of england . 
   not weird at all . 
   how much migration do you think scotland and n.ireland get ? 
  very little , plus they get more public spending than england . 
  and how much immigration do you think does the country side of wales or north england get ? 
  its a fact that people who actually have regular contact to migrants , wanted to stay in . 
  for example london .
