  it 's almost like both of them read the same book . 
  its called `` average '' . 
  what about a load of fishy balls ? 
  yeah . 
  thats the problem when all the world speaks english while at the same time the uk press is one big piece of trash that is existing mostly thanks to click bait articles . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2015/sep/01/mama-merkel-the-compassionate-mother-of-syrian-refugees this and similar stupid articles were shown to syrian refugees . 
  by whom ? 
  human traffickers all over the region . 
  its basically used like a official brochure as proof that they 're welcome over here . 
  no meaty balls for you !, 
  another vvictim of ruthless politicians and the press , who ignite the stupid masses to push their political program and to get the people to vote for whatever they want . 
  thanks theresa may . 
  thanks nigel farage . 
  another victim of the people you 've incinerated with your political agenda . 
  did n't know that vodka counts as tea in russia !, 
  but we currently have one of the lowest euro prices since the $ exists . 
  most of the time it was over 1.30 $ . 
  now its at 1.10-1 .15 . 
  so greece has a good time since 2014 . 
  did n't help that much , though . 
  maybe because those articles are just opinions and not `` sources '' for anything . 
  you know `` it is written on the internet !, 
  it must be the truth ! '', 
  is no very smart conclusion . 
  also , from your article : https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjwhbfdfxiu/i4pbndifsnmw/v2/800x-1.png this picture says 1.40 = the exchange rate germany needs . 
  just look again . 
  i edited to post with two links and statistics . 
  and your links are not `` sources '' . 
  i bet you havent even read them . 
  they are all contradicting each other on your initial assumption that a low currency is bad for greece . 
  your bloomberg link is even more obvious . 
  it has a huge map even the dumbest person should get . 
  in that map the assumption 1.40 = good for germany is made . 
  how can you not see that ? 
  you are absolutely fabulous . 
   o_o  of course selling at the same rate at 25 % higher price is `` not that bad '' . 
   dude . 
  you wont sell as much as you do , if your price is 25 % higher . 
  unbelievable . 
  its ok . just ignore the statistics and take a piece of text out of the context . 
  good way if you want to get nowhere and still go on believing whatever you think you need . 
  my echo chamber assumption was right , i guess . 
  what a waste of time . 
   if you had 1.40 , essentially everything that germany exports ( you know what export is , right ? 
  selling goods outside ? 
  engine of german economy ? ), 
  would be roughly 25 % more expensive . 
  if we sell at the same rate , that 's not bad . 
  because , you know , if we export something we get paid . 
  not the other way around . 
  it could lead to less customers theoretically . 
  but take a look at the export rate and try to compare it to our export volume : http://www.xe.com/de/currencycharts/?from=eur&amp;to=usd&amp;view=10y https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports look at that curve . 
  its was much more steep pre 2008 and took a large hit . 
  and we had a much higher exchange rate back then since then its comparably shallow . 
  we are still not over the financial crisis 2008 . 
  people forget that regularly . 
  the article say best for germany = 1.40 to get the most from it . 
  it 's good for germany to have 1.40 . 
  not 1.40 to give all of europe the biggest benefit . 
  we had a very good time , when the exchange rate was high . 
  exchange rate of 1.40 = good for germany . 
  1.00 best for greece . 
  currently we are closer to best for greece then best for germany . 
  and it was for some month even lower . 
  read your own article . 
  let me cite yourself :  euro is ruining the south , while benefitting the more advanced euro zone economies . 
   its not even controversial anymore . 
  thats not your statement . 
  your statement was the euro is bad . 
  and then you quote a article which says a low euro is good for south europe . 
  we currently have a low euro . 
  conclusion : current exchange rate is good for south europe . 
  this article says a high euro around 1.40 would be best for germany and greece needs a low euro . 
  we are currently at ~ 1.10 . 
  so the current rate is good for greece . 
  or with other words : still no conclusion that backs your statement . 
  let me cite yourself :  euro is ruining the south , while benefitting the more advanced euro zone economies . 
   its not even controversial anymore . 
  your article says the exact opposite . 
  in one says the euro is too weak ... for germany , not for greece . 
   `` the ecb must make policy that works for europe as a whole , '' schaeuble told germany 's tagesspiegel . 
  `` it is too loose for germany . ''  `` the euro exchange rate is , strictly speaking , too low for the german economy the next article says the weak euro is good for germany . 
   germany for its part has been profiting from the euro 's downslide . 
  for the world 's second largest export nation , a weaker euro is like an economic stimulus plan . 
  and the third one tells something in the middle , saying that the weak euro causes inflation in germany :  the economy ca n't grow much faster than it already is . 
  so more monetary stimulus will just produce inflation . 
  you might even want to cut back to prevent the german economy from overheating . 
   the problem is that the ecb is responsible for both greece and germany -- and 17 other countries as well . 
  the right policy for greece will be a disaster for germany , and vice versa . 
  any policy the ecb picks will be either too tight for some european countries or too loose for others . 
  so i do n't see your `` not even controversial any more '' . 
  where is it ? 
   i 'm sorry to hear this subject is taking such a toll on you mentally . 
   if you ca n't handle it , you 're also welcome to shut up . 
  your brain must be a very nice place to live in . 
  but the outside world is n't so bad either . 
  do n't give up . 
  you are presenting one half truth after another , while ignoring extremely simple and openly available facts . 
  i do n't see another explanation . 
  lets not forget that you are the one claiming that this is `` not even controversial any more '' .
