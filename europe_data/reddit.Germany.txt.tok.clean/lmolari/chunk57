  recording showed that no incident involving foreigners or football fans took place '' a very slight but interesting difference . 
  in your sentence the `` recording showed that no incident took place '' while the police says `` the record does not result in any incident ... '' . 
  a tiny but very important difference . 
  if google translate is right i would consider that a real dick-move . 
   those are facts . 
  they are not . 
   no adult , including their teacher saw any of what they claimed had happened , it 's pretty normal for pupils of that age to roam around a city alone . 
  they are no compact group of 6 year old children who are watched by adults from all sides . 
  so ... this is no fact . 
   not cctv recorded that . 
  ( we do have a lot of cctv in poland , both city owned as well as private owned ) . 
  no cctv just means it has n't been caught on camera . 
  especially if the dude was living in town he could have known about zones/small streets without camera surveillance . 
  so , if there is not 100 % of cctv coverage this can never be a fact . 
  its a indicator at best . 
   kids did n't file the report according to zeit and deutschlandfunk they first tried it on the street and then in a police station . 
  so if the police really laughed in their faces , then that is the reason there was no report . 
  its pretty a strange move from you to accuse the kids of not filing a report , after they complained that the police laughed at them . 
  there are indeed doubts because even too me it sounds a bit too much . 
  its just to much for one trip . 
  but this are nonetheless not facts . 
  we 'll see when we get the results of this investigation . 
  sorry , but i would miss the nice people of slovenia too much . 
  if you 'd come out of your cellar sometimes , instead of wasting your time with nitpicking meaningless posts on reddit , i 'm sure you 'd know some , too . 
  btw : its leather slippers , not flip flops !, 
  sorry , but the wild chive on fresh bread early in the morning is just too tempting . 
  i also liked the parties at those mountain hostels in the evening . 
  very nice . 
  we paid for slovenia with our tax money . 
  so i guess all is in order !, 
  well , on hiking tours as easy as the triglav 7 lakes tour that 's actually no problem . 
  btw : normally - when i 'm not prepared - i wear leather slippers . 
  even worse then flip flops because the sole is pretty slick . 
  fixed it for you . 
  and you are right . 
  there are positive news about good relations and cooperation . 
  just not from this direction . 
  i feel pretty alienated by all this hate in the last time . 
  as i said . 
  either we suck the life out of them or we are close friends of russia . 
  not sure what we did to them in the last months . 
  because i do not remember this much heat over the last year combined . 
  haha . 
  same old story every time . 
  it becomes not more true , just because you repeat it over and over again . 
  another dude with a victim complex -  check . 
   there comes all these endless macaron-merkel , `` leaders of the free world '' drivels , and the `` progressive '' salivation what goes with it . . do n't mix this up . 
  i 'm talking about ~ ~ your ~ ~ ** polands ** direction . 
  not the direction of the entire world . 
  i 'm not entirely but almost sure that there was not a ** single ** nice word about germany coming from poland in the last time on this sub . 
  so please : do n't cry me a river . 
  well , maybe there is some kind of propaganda war , who knows ? 
  because last time i looked it was the same the other way around . 
  evil germans promoting nordstream !, 
  evil germans sucking life out of southern european countries !, 
  evil germans taking over our economy !, 
  evil germans are not going to keep to their word and would never defend poor poland against putin !, 
  evil germans ( eu = germoney ) want to force refugees on us !, 
  but im pretty sure as someone with such a extreme victim complex you 've never noticed the shitstream going in the other direction . 
  true , no pure polish thing . 
  happened in germany , too . 
  there are assholes everywhere . 
  what i hate is people being in complete denial , defending the police and the country - or short being nationalistic pricks - without even any rational thought like `` lets wait for the investigation '' or `` poor girl '' . 
  its either `` fake news '' or `` muslims are scum '' . 
  there is a school class giving eye witness and a police report about police officers playing dumb and being unable to understand the girl . 
  enough for me , but most probably not enough for something like you . 
  yeah , its all just another evil conspiration against poor ~ ~ peoples ~ ~ victims of poland . 
  for spitting little girl in the face or defending people who do it i would consider this phrase . 
  there are animals who behave better . 
  hehe . 
  lots of people showing their true face today . 
  lots of opportunity to turn / r/europe into the echochamber i 'd love it to be . 
  you 're right . 
  the source is saying the same as zeit . 
  the polish news-site also says there was a group of foreigners who approached them , but they were n't able to understand them . 
  its not the source , its the user who hid that `` little '' detail . 
  this is a official statement of the police after being asked by the press . 
  but i see what you 're going to try . 
  after obscuring the truth you now try to say you actually never really lied . 
  the thing is : police officers after a day of duty report more then just crimes . 
  they report on anything that happened during duty . 
  so i 'm sorry to say even without a crime , it 's still a `` report '' . 
  yes , sadly it is . 
  i think everyone has the right to an opinion , even to voice it . 
  but assaulting children is a whole different story . 
  those people belong in a dark and ugly jail cell . 
   however , they have not heard any information that would indicate a crime or misdemeanor committed against any of them . 
  this is not `` police reports nothing '' . 
  this is `` police was not able to understand them '' . 
  if you compare this statement to the interview with the girl , they are absolutely describing the same situation . 
  up to the point where `` polite smiles were exchanged '' . 
  google translate gives a different translation :  they were foreigners who spoke english . 
  police officers did not know the communicative language of this language so they used the help of several pedestrians . 
  dialogue in english rolled between these people . 
  due to the linguistic barrier and information noise resulting from the transmission of several police officers , they may not have understood all the intentions of the reporters . 
  however , they have not heard any information that would indicate a crime or misdemeanor committed against any of them . 
  munduk offered to call another car . 
  finally , the cops heard from people explaining that there was no problem at all . 
  people exchanged polite smiles . '', 
  so , they were approached by a group of `` foreigners '' who spoke english but they did n't understand them in cause of language barriers and `` information noise '' which i translate to shouting and crying .
