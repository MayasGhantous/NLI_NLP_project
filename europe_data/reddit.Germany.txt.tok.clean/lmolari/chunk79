   thats a very open question and a proper response would be too long ( sorry , i just cant be bothered to go over this for the 100th time ) , so ill just say there are many reasons and factors that make me think this idea is bad . 
  yes , yes . 
  i did this also for many times . 
  yet i also have n't seen a valid `` reason or factor '' . 
  to me it 's just xenophobia , hidden behind a wide array of arguments . 
  but i think we do n't need to agree on this . 
  you do n't want refugees . 
  and i think it 's a shame to those in need your help , for whatever reason there could be . 
  where there 's a will , there 's a way . 
  that is a very simple truth to me . 
  i think we need to conclude with a classical `` we agree to disagree '' . 
  but the whole idea of the regulation is to redistribute them , not caring about the country they applied for asylum at first or where they want to go . 
  why is that idea so wrong for you ? 
  is n't it actually a good idea that they are shared equally , depending on how well a country is doing and how many people life there ? 
  i want to remember that they are refugees . 
  they have no right for immigration after the war is over for them , if you do n't chose to give it to them . 
  just read the wiki article . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nhindustries_nh90 various nice reviews and even some records . 
  but as i said : its not really rare that this happens on new aircraft . 
  but you are right . 
  it 's not the most flawless project . 
  but compared to the tiger helicopter or the a400m it 's pretty nice . 
  the tiger is in my opinion the most stupid helicopter ever . 
  too light to use a 30 or 40mm cannon because it is moving by the knock-back and therefor can not aim well enough . 
  but this type of gun alone is the biggest reason why you bring a helicopter to anti-terror mission . 
  so the germans decided for 2 fixed 12,7 mgs . 
  downside : they need to come pretty close . 
  so : even more stupid . 
  they also developed paws . 
  a nice rocket , but stupidly expensive . 
  conclusion : the whole project is garbage . 
  i 'm not sure if this multi-country cooperation and everyone developing a little part of it is really carrying fruits . 
  we also should consider if all those cost cutting was a good idea . 
  because it looks a lot more expensive after all these corrections . 
  that 's the excuse i always hear . 
  nonetheless there are more applications in even poorer countries then poland . 
  so i do n't buy that excuse . 
  my point is : you are right , on its own it 's unfair to only prosecute 3 countries . 
  but the reason why they are pissed and want prosecution in the first place is because they not only fail to miss the criteria . 
  they even completely denied to try it . 
  i can understand why they are pissed off . 
  so do n't let it look like an accident , please . 
  poland even told us the reason why there are no refugees themself : http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-refuses-to-take-a-single-refugee-because-of-security-fears-a7020076.html if i 'm right those 47 are btw . 
  christian syrians . 
  there were changes . 
  as you see for yourself they worked on it until 2015 . 
  also : typhoon can carry about 1500kg less weight . 
  so what ? 
  aircraft has engine problem ? 
  that means they 're all shit ? 
  just google ah 64 engine fail . 
  or just about any existing chopper/plane . 
  maybe you 'll find one , who have n't had a bad day . 
  not so sure . 
  if i read that right , poland got a few thousand refugees . 
  not sure if from syria , though . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/8/86/number_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu_and_efta_member_states%2c_2015_and_2016_%28thousands_of_first_time_applicants%29_yb17.png and hungary even more . 
  edit : ah , there we are . 
  47 from syria . 
  guess that generall unwillingness to take any refugees from syria in , is the problem . 
  the reason is explained pretty clearly in the article :  with others also dragging their feet , the scheme has been a failure and fewer than 21,000 people have been moved so far . 
  immigration numbers have fallen since the height of the crisis in 2015 after a deal with turkey , leaving the dispute largely a political one . 
   only poland , hungary and the czech republic do not have pledges pending to accept asylum-seekers under the plan . 
   that allows the commission to single them out on that formal basis , rather than open legal cases against just about every eu state for failing to take in the whole of their assigned quota . 
  so as you say it 's more of a symbolic act . 
  and even that is too much ? 
  obviously . 
  maybe the difference is that those 3 told everyone that they do n't want to fulfill it , while the rest of them did n't ? 
  sounds like bullshit . 
  they just want to distract from the real problems . 
  reality is that we have to say `` thank you for this bullshit '' to the banks who caused the banking crisis in 2008 . 
  and we need to say thank you , that after this countries were close to be bankrupted by them , they gave them a very poor rating . 
  and what is the result of a bad rating ? 
  no investments ? 
  the wages in germany grow in the same way since decades . 
  https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/wages while the investments are perfectly clear . 
  let me take spain as a example . 
  click 10y on all graphs . 
  ratings go up : https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/rating 2 . 
  investments go up shortly after this : https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/gross-fixed-capital-formation 3 . 
  unemployment goes down : https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/unemployment-rate so truth is much more simple than all that bullshit we hear about germany or cheap labor in the east , or whatever . 
  banks bankrupted those economies . 
  then they gave them a poor rating because they were bankrupt . 
  and then the investment went down and interest rate went up . 
  result : stagnation for years with high unemployment , until someone - i do n't want to say germany - started to invest again . 
  rating went up , investors came back , new businesses started , unemployment is going down . 
  fuck those goldman sachs lobbyists and their bullshit . 
  so it is n't even about immigrant quotas ? 
  because , you know , immigrants are not refugees until you allow them to become one . 
   economical and social one . 
  migrants from north africa , sub-saharan african and turkey is a complete and utter failure in every sense of the word . 
  whats up ? 
  did the internet not provide you with enough bullshit about turks in germany ? 
  is that why you need to throw in a few others , to make your sentence right again ? 
  cheap , really cheap . 
   any country with the means to do so are `` responsible '' for global warming . 
  that is a very sad perception . 
  but i guess any third world country would think so , too . 
  maybe one day , if you have something to give , this will change . 
   i 'm simply not gon na light myself on fire to keep someone else warm .
