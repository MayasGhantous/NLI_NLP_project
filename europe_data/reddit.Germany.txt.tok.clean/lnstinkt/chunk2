  you mean , that when wilhelm i. took the crown in versailles ( ! ), 
  they were still at war ??? 
  hard to believe . 
  edit : wow , you were right , indeed that war was n't decided in military terms at the beginning of '71 since france took a deep breath and was about to exhale some additional 350.000 recruits , but the inner-french problems ( kinda civil war ) kept them from continuing war after the armicide . 
  although i knew that history is never text book black and white , i never heard of those facts before . 
  `` the eternal chancellor '' - beautiful picture . 
  you , sir , do the god of the colourblinded 's work . 
  czech presidential candidates, 
  well , i do n't think centre-right does apply to merkels government . 
  she put her party , teh cdu , very much tho the center line , whereas the polish center-right are right-wing-nutjobs in comaprison . 
  somehow i could imagine sarkzoy grabbing the prize out of their hands and say `` my prrreccioouuussssssss '', 
  as in george soros ? 
  did he become a philanthropist ? 
  in my opinion data privacy in general is a huge issue here in germany . 
  my state 's data protection law speaks for itself  in the year 1970 the federal state of hesse passed the first national data protection law , which was also the first data protection law in the world . 
  ( source : [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesdatenschutzgesetz#1970-1990 ) ) also the fact that the pirates have huge success in many state elections recently shows - since the pirates are actually a mono-toppic party for data protection - how important data protection is for many germans ... and on the other hand , that it needs to be optimzied . 
  anyway , i can assure you that the stuff you read in the lawblogs are the exemption . 
  in fact , there are also extreme examples in the other direction : when a wife kills her husband , she has legally no claim for a widow 's pension ( the additional amount from her [ dead ] husband ) . 
  however , even if the woman is convicted in a criminal court , there is no automatic notice to the agency of the pensions service office due to the ( social ) data protection . 
  so , only if the pension 's agency clerk coincidentally read in the newspaper who the wife is and that she is convicted , then the widow 's pension is questioned . 
  there are many more of those examples regarding police , etc which show clearly , how sensitive germany still is about data protection . 
  i did nazi that coming . 
  i saw your point , just , i think it was n't hipocracy but humanity ( to prevent pogroms in heated situations ) when france demanded a stop of aggressions towards roma and sinti . 
  also , it prolly was the french government who insisted to fix the situation not france as the collective of all citizens . 
  ... and i 'm sure , btw , that the same `` france '' is even more critical to its own citizens regarding these incidents . 
  you will see a lot of reaction in the french public and the vast majority will not defend the vigilantism here . 
  here in germany , `` zigeuner '' ( gypsy , cigany ) is considered racsist by their representatives , too , and instead we should say `` roma and sinti '' . 
  however , the word `` zigeuner '' is still common in the age group 30 + . 
  actually it is often used if you want to imply a negative connotation or even as an insult : football fans call the fans of the other teams sometimes `` scheiss [ insert other club here ] zigeuner '' . 
  anyway , it was absolutely right when france demanded the stop of some pogroms against this minority in eastern europe . 
  there is no right for people to become violent against others . 
  there is police and authority for things like that . 
  glad you made that clear ^ ^, 
  muslims ? 
  or just the minority of muslims living in greece and even then another minority of the greek muslims protesting against that movie ? 
  so , muslims or a minority of a minority of muslims ? 
  uhm , yes they are . 
  destruction without any reason . 
  do you think they have the right to teach `` lessons '' ? 
  where is it shown , that the merchant did n't have a permission ? 
  what if he just left it at home this day ? 
  you do n't need a phd in political science to see where this kind of actions are heading . 
  erosion of government will lead to more violence . 
  good point . 
  also , regarding the `` race '' ... the guy speaking in the end of the clip from ~ 1:40 min , he looks more slavic than greek . 
  it 's the same with second-generation immigrants in the us who are often super-patriotic . 
  some people often seem to feel the need to show their partriotism . 
  then they are overcompensating it . 
  if you 're also dumb as a brick , you go right-wing . 
  ( it 's like the guy in the end goes right-wing so no one would question his `` beliefs '' , since - one day - he could get confronted as not looking greek enough o.o, 
  you , sir , win this thread . 
  oh , now you 're in charge of whom to bail out and whom not ?!, 
  you 're just perpetuing stereotypes ( lazy south , efficient north ) . 
  do n't feel superior just because you were born here ... 
  i think what asyx was pointing out is that killing with a knife ( or bare hands ) generally implies that you have to getting over some constraint which is programmed into the human genes - not only stabbing the first time , or continuing with stabbing after the human cry of death fear from the victim , but to interact with the victim close range etc pp . 
  usually humans stop when this cry is heard ( not of course if in complete rage ) . 
  with a pistol or rifle you never have that cry since it 's over within a part of a second ... at least that 's what i learnt in criminology, 
   but , being pro-gun and profoundly against most forms of government where is that link to the [ jason alexander essay ] ( http://www.twitlonger.com/show/if2nht ) again ? 
  they see me rollin ',

  relevant wiki-article : [ the streisand effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ), 
  what you did there , i see it . 
  the german-french tv-station `` arte '' had a great feature about this : [ the genesis of racism ] ( http://ddc.arte.tv/folge/die-entstehung-des-rassismus ) . 
  it 's in collaboration with french anti-racism-activist lilian thuram . 
  are you guys kidding or is budapest separated in buda and pest ? 
  like districts or is this only inofficial ? 
  do n't put your light under the table , fellow brit . 
  you may not have your own lake for everyone , but your island jsut as amazing . 
  also gardening could n't be invented by someone else as the british . 
  it just boosted the beauty . 
  way better than our uncultivated areas in germany . 
  yeah , that 's why all their women seem in shape and have a nice skin colour . 
  in christiana you could also other stuff - like afghan . 
  what is a reasonable price for coperto ?

  same goes for venice . 
  food and beverages there are ridiculously expensive for minor quality/service . 
  they know , they do n't need to invest much in your experience , since they do n't rely on tourists coming back . 
  to a certain degree that principle works everywhere in tourism . 
  lot 's of reasons . 
  primary could be the symbolism ... as in although we 're enemies-til-death , we still grant a proper funeral to each other . 
  of course , since we switched from erbfeinschaft to erbfreundschaft , the symbolism shifted more to a monumental thing , what stupid waste of resources a war is .

  for those not familiar with sausagestry : in germany and france we call them * wiener w\u00fcrstchen * ( or french : saucisses de vienne ) while pretty much the rest of the world call them [ frankfurter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurter_w%c3%bcrstchen ) . 
  * boq * and * schindetnemo * are totally aware of that proclaiming power of definition for themselves . ^ ^ edit : fyi - in germany ( and france ) , we also have * frankfurters * , but we mean [ the real ones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurter_w%c3%bcrstchen ) . 
  edit 2 : what i thought was great humour was just a little ignorance by schindetnemo ... great username , though ^ ^, 
  in anthems it 's pol 0 : rus 1 edit : i want to correct myself ... more like 0:2 for poland 's own goal, 
  idk , but for me the title suggests that we do n't need to address this problem . 
  the epilogue however proclaims time 's running out . 
  i do n't find water-saving `` misleading '' . 
  it 's just the beginning of growing concern about this issue . 
  this makes the people in power sensitive .
