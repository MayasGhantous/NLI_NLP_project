  i 'm glad we save water . 
  i will lay in a good word for you , dear anonymous internet friend . 
  this is why i love r/europe . 
  what did they bring us ? 
  wine , infrastructure , pandectic law and peace ... fuck off !, 
  pudding ? 
  but even if ... die gr\u00fcnen ( `` greens '' = ecological party ) started out that way , too . 
  and look how they carried the toppic into the parliament !, 
  without the gr\u00fcnen in power , the conservative-liberal government in germany decided to get rid of nuclear energy . 
  if the pirates achieve the same regarding data protection as a civil right , then the world is a little beter place . 
  as tin_dog said : the fdp was always the junior coalition member . 
  the last results in elections and polls since the financial crisis are devastating . 
  it is now about survival of the party itself ... this ca n't be explained by just being the junior coalition member . 
  the fdp was formed by westerwelle , who is an opportunist careerist , for more than a decade into this mono-thematic party ( economy ) . 
  they have better traditions then that ( freedom as in civil rights , not economical freedom [ with leutheuser-schnarrenberger , kubicki , etc. ] ) . 
  i really hope they have good results in the state of schleswig-holstein so more people like kubicki are in power . 
  this could change the fdp to the best . 
  the culture of beheadings ? 
  when i wrote `` mind = blown '' i was at the paragraph were you stated that you 're actually an expat from the us . 
  that was very , very nice to read . 
  intellectual deepness by an american critizising the free market . 
  very east-coastesque ^ ^ i needed to stop reading shortly after because important football match takes place now . 
  but i will read it tomorrow morning in all ... relaxed status . 
  with my morning coffee . 
  i will edit it ( which i learned is iving you an automated notice ) . 
  thx so much already !, 
  mind = blown, 
  replay to `` later edit '' : actually i thought it should be native language at first . 
  but rules are to be broken or sth like that ^ ^ thx for your contribution !, 
  on second reading i may now see your point . 
  you wanted to point out that even if the perp is a muslim jihadists he also is ( just ) a french extremist . 
  yes , it seems to be ... 
  i 'm very sensitive to right wing propaganda and i hate generalizations on european muslims . 
  but dude , hold your breath for a second and think about it - when you call someone like this perpetrator in toulouse a `` neo-nazi '' then it becomes absurd . 
  no more words needed . 
  you have to realize that you are in the minority if you define jihadists as neo-nazis . 
  do you want me to explain the differences to you ? 
  that was way more interesting than the hard facts , 
  okay , `` if '' is a island in front of marseille . 
  a fort was build there in the middle ages . 
  it became a prison , but is a tourist attraction for quite some time now . 
  kinda like the french alcatraz . 
  with the siege going on in toulouse for hours , it seems pretty much proven that the perp is an self-declared islamic jihadist called `` mohamed m. '', 
   but those citizenships are n't even on the same level as there is no european country or nation . 
  yes , correct . 
  but there already is sth . 
  called union citizenship ( german : `` unionsb\u00fcrgerschaft '' gem . 
  art . 
  every citizen of an eu member state is automatically a citizen of the eu . 
  therefor you have certain rights and duties ( f. ex . 
  the right to move freely within the eu member states ) . 
  just want to day that even if you do n't feel it , the eu-citizenship is coming . 
  what is chateau d'if ? 
  wow ... i ca n't even describe how great your comment is !, 
  thx so much !, 
  edit : since my english sucks and my knowledge about financial stuff is even less than zero , i summarize ( and ask control questions ) and maybe so . 
  can correct me when wrong : austria 's stance regarding ftt is ( unsurprisingly ) divided because their economy depends more on the financial sector than , f.i. , germany 's ? 
  therefor being attractive for investement is essential for austria , but they know that it 's actually necessary to get an ftt because outherwise other countries ( esp . 
  east-european ones ) could make the same and the whole financial sector gets dangerous ( again ) ? 
  what are `` captured '' regulatory bodies ? 
  i understand `` regulatory bodies '' ( like the bafin in germany which is looking at banks that they have enough own money before they invest ) . 
  the same exists for the eu ( i think they renamed/restructured the regulatory bodies for financial stuff recently , but made a step back ??? ) . 
  however , due to context i read `` captured '' as `` open '' , since the regulatory bodies in the uk and us are more `` pro-financial sector '' . 
  next word : `` volatile '' . 
  is this a technical term ? 
  i udnerstand the translation ( in the cheical way ) ... but can i translate it with `` high frequency '' or more like `` instable '' ? 
  why ? 
  can someone give me a simple introduction of what 's happening ? 
  who in the eu is supporting transaction tax ? 
  igues anybody besides gb ? 
  what would the transaction tax mean outside the eu - who is the eu then competing with ? 
  if germany , i strongly suggest [ r\u00fcdesheim ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%bcdesheim_am_rhein ) . . it 's a historical small town with rural but typical german culture . 
  then have a little hike up to the [ germania ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niederwalddenkmal ) , make some pictures and feel good . 
  drive down with the gondola lift and get drunk in the drosselgasse ( you might see hordes of japanese tourists but there are also plenty of germans there . . it 's jsut great ) . 
  there will be lot 's of stag parties ( groups of girls accompagning the girl getting married ) ... all in broad daylight . 
  make sure the weather is good . 
  idk about the nightlife , because everytime i 've been there , we went back into bigger cities ( [ wiesbaden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiesbaden ) - where i come from and i also suggest !, 
  - or mainz to continue partying . 
  this is true . 
  but as many paliaments in the history they have to find possibilities to make themselves more important than they are now . 
  maybe regarding blockade to get a reform so the ep gets more rights etc. ... 
  do n't judge too quickly . 
  the german media did this recently and it was [ shameful ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/q2gln/silence_for_neonazi_victims/ ) . 
  if any french or jewish european people are here ... i am sorry for what happened . 
  okay , but everybody who played civ4 in english will understand that nuclear meltdown equals the super-gau ^ ^, 
  so you 're saying nuclear plants are constructed for gaus ? 
  you 're right ... my condolences and empathy to those who have to suffer due to the accident . 
  well , then it 's a win-win situation, 
  i think `` super gau '' may not be common in english . 
  although everybody should 've get it due to context , he meant sth like nuclear energy implies a ( small ) chance of nuclear meltdown . 
  ( super - ) gau is an acronym for `` gr\u00f6\u00dfter anzunehmender unfall '' = biggest accident imaginable . 
  the prefix `` super '' tops that gau ( which is somehow impossible . . or , while thinking about it , it perfectly implies that some technologies ca n't be controlled if the unimaginable happens ... maybe i interpret too much into it , but it fits perfectly to the fact , that this is the reason , why germany invests in renewable ( controllable ) energy ... 
  `` rise '' is a wide term ... 
  thx , that helped . 
  there was no mention in german news about this . 
  germany , france and brittain opposed ? 
  i 'm sure it 's because they want big business with monsanto ( or having an own european monsanto , soon ) . 
  did n't even click the link ... what is it about ? 
  let me guess : everybody could see form the start that the euro is from the devil . 
  germany and france are dictating everything .
