  though i think that a judge will most likely rule favorably for him , as it was a somewhat extraordinary situation . 
  the 90s are back . 
  unscientific pc bullshit is alive an well . 
  they tried to come for metal , they tried to come for d&d , they tried to come for video games . 
  now there 's a push to regulate the internet under the guise of protecting women ( and children ) . 
  not surprising , really . 
  this is one of the cases where i believe in the sanity and laziness of our leaders alike . 
  as this is kind of a fringe issue , most likely nothing will happen that has any effect on anybody . 
  pretty good debunking anyway . 
  i also laughed a bit at that :  alternatively , it 's the urge to bully someone who was dumb enough to link to their c : drive in a paper for the united nations . 
  when i was grading a lab report for 1st semester students as a research assistant , someone did this and we had a bit of a laugh and a talk about sources and how you cite correctly . 
  that this happens in such a high-profile publication is somewhere between sad and worrying . 
  that 's even just slightly outside the margin of error for large-scale polls . 
  it 's also pretty common that , during an ongoing crisis , support for how it is handled will drop a bit as the results are slow to come in and people can feel like current policies have no effect , when in reality the effects will likely emerge months in the future . 
  what was factually untrue there ? 
  asking because i try to be open about my perception of this problem , but i see a lot of misinformation , prejudice and generalization ( people having no knowledge of police work in europe but claiming to know precisely how migrants can dodge anything , people purposefully confusing migrant , refugee and asylum seekers ) and try to fight that . 
  knowledge is the only way people can improve themselves and the world around them . 
  i provide sources and try to argue from a logical stance . 
  yet i have often been met with great things like `` migrants all look the same , so they can hide in the masses '' and intellectual acrobats that claim , with no data to support it , that many come here to freely steal and rape , when in reality this would hamstring their idea of building a better life for themselves ( which is what these same people accuse the economic migrants of trying to do ) . 
  where 's the rationale there ? 
  i obviously do n't want anybody to get raped , but the problem is here now , it arrived months ago . 
  we can hardly shoot anybody that looks brown and suspicious , so we have to deal with it within the constraints of out law , which works reasonably well , given the circumstances . 
  at the same time , our parliament here is working hard on reforms for faster processing and deportation of declined applicants . 
  but though i try my best to provide context and have an open discussion i am met with silent downvotes and derailing ( above i wrote about how police deal with the rapes and what tough situations a rapist will face , like no benefits , housing etc. 
  if he chose to disappear into the masses , which was met with `` so you want the women to just deal with it '' despite me never claiming anything of the sort ) . 
  it 's a fucking mess and trying to be neutral gets you hate more often than not . 
  sad , really . 
  so , specific examples of apologist behaviour please . 
  haha damn , did n't see it , that 's actually kind of funny in a cheeky way . 
  ( no hard feelings , dclauzel , i like you , but come on this is great ), 
  what do you want to show with `` this '' ? 
  it 's just the front page ? 
   also , question for you : how exactly is registering going to result in them immediately being caught , as you think ? 
  pictures , databases . 
  police work . 
  criminals that are being sought after usually have an entry in national and international police databases . 
  you still did not answer my request for data , btw . 
  we are talking about rape ( and general crime ) as if it was a huge epidemic and yet i see no data that refugee/migrant routes suffer more or less heavily from it than other parts of the country . 
   and anyone who gets raped by an unregistered person just has to deal with it then ? 
  yes , as everyone that is raped has to . 
  by going to the police , filing a report and letting justice run it 's course . 
  the rapist either gets caught when trying to steal to sustain himself ( as registering is not an option ) , gets identified by video/photo evidence or quite literally dies in the gutter . 
  `` just looking at sweden '' shows me nothing right now , except claims that the rapists there are not prosecuted for fear of appearing racist , or at least that appears to be the accusation-flavour of the day . 
  nothing about unregistered migrants . 
  right , what do you think that was written here is apologist in nature and not realist ? 
  what precise points do you believe to be factually untrue and be narrative spinning ? 
  nah , the only way to survive ** for an unlimited time ** is to be registered . 
  the migrant route is expensive as hell , also because it takes so long and you need supplies . 
  but those supplies are pretty much used up if you reach your destination . 
  it will be very hard to be essentially invisible in germany , france , the uk etc. 
  if you still want some standard of living . 
  these people come here fleeing a war and/or to seek a ** better ** standard of live than back home , not become homeless rapists . 
   european immigrants usually easily integrate . 
  what if i now claim those that will get asylum ( syrians , mostly ) will integrate well too ? 
  can you disprove this ? 
  on those people , we have no data yet . 
   a '' refugee '' will just rape a woman then hop on a train . 
  and then never be able to be registered for benefits ever again . 
  no housing , no clothing and no food for him . 
  he 's now either forced to be homeless or risk being caught by registering without papers and having his picture taken . 
  this entire discussion is so painful because i saw this all before . 
  my grandfather was basically a fossilized nazi and i had to argue with him quite often that he even let my polish friend from school come over ( he feared he would steal from us ) . 
  i really just want people to think of others as people without demonizing an entire ethnicity . 
  it 's harrowing . 
  okay , you calling me a nazi by proxy was uncalled for and you know it . 
  to your point : do you have any data to back up your wild west claim ? 
  your police should hear of the theft and rape and compile a report , should n't they ? 
  unsolved crimes are still registered , so you should probably be able to lay the data over a map and it should fit the refugees/migrant stream perfectly . 
  dude , you really imagine that this hypothetical criminal would not be registered in any of the camps but at the same time would get to use transport to and from camps in which registration is happening , constantly , and would manage to survive with no money , housing or clothing all this time and choose to do so just to be able to steal some stuff and/or rape someone a few times ? 
  what the fuck ? 
   question for you : if i did what you suggested and became a murdering hobo , would the powers that be encourage my victim not to report it to the police ? 
  read the article , it was not the powers that be . 
  it was also one claim by one woman a month after the fact where the organization themselves vehemently deny it and police have not yet any results . 
  we know nothing here . 
  a eu citizen could , as i explained to you up there , just ditch their passport and phone and go on a murder spree as a homeless drifter - but they would not get money or housing or transport that way . 
  it 's completely retarded to assume someone would give up all benefits to steal some shit that , in value , is not even close to housing and benefits or rape on woman . 
  you construct this weird imagine of an invisible supervillain that needs no shelter or food or clothing or transport ( which all cost money ) and only comes here to commit crimes with no registration . 
  come on , at least read about how processing is done . 
  yeah , those unregistered people moving between countries constantly are essentially homeless drifters and do n't get any benefits , housing or help . 
  they effectively cripple themselves if they do n't register . 
  do you really think someone would , for the chance to rape one woman scot-free , then run off to another country , not register there , do another rape , then run off to another country , not register there and so on , all without money , all without housing ? 
  come on . 
  first step of processing is registration , where your picture is taken and entered into a database . 
  if someone really wanted to pull this off , they could not rely on following the refugee streams in any way . 
  as soon as processing happened , they would be in trouble . 
  and if they dodged all processing , they would just be some homeless guy with no money , no housing and no transport . 
  dude , that is then not an issue specific to our current migration crisis and his claim of supposed migrant supervillains , is it ? 
  because what you are now describing is something you yourself could do , right now . 
  throw away your phone and all identifying documents and live as a homeless drifter , stealing and killing until you get caught in the act . 
  but nobody in their right mind would do that , because you get no housing , no benefits and no help without registration and documentation . 
  if they are not , they are only doing what you , right now , also could do : ditch all your possessions , ditch your phone and run off . 
  no housing , no money , no work . 
  but you are invisible and can theoretically rape and murder as a homeless drifter . 
   like when people claimed that a edeka now that there is an asylum center nearby had a highly increased number of stuff beeing stolen and might soon have to close down due to this , and the manager then had to come out , and say ( over internet comments ridiculous ) that nothing like that has happened that there is not an increased number of stuff beeing stolen etc. 
  for which he then got insulted by rightwingers ... yeah , that was pretty funny to me actually . 
  it 's almost satirical in nature . 
  you see general accusations thrown around , when those who supposedly was stolen from come forward and say `` nah , no stealing here '' they then get accused of pushing an agenda . 
  kafka would be amazed how well his works have been implemented . 
  golden dawn is a bit of a different story , as they also rode the coattails of anti-austerity movements and a very weak national government . 
  their main points ( found here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_dawn_ ( political_party ) #national _ plan ) includes only one migration-specific point .
