  where is this from ? 
  and why was there even a protest ? 
  pretty neat . 
  got the heraldry write-up for me ? 
  what are you criticizing , precisely ? 
  i am trying to understand concerns people may have . 
  in my opinion , the way we deal with this is pretty good . 
  our parliament is currently fast-tracking quicker processing and there is work done to declare some countries safe as to easier decline applicants . 
  there is also a push to cut benefits for those denied asylum to facilitate a faster deportation ( right now people can stay some time and still receive housing and money ) . 
  what else would you demand we do , realistically ? 
  i think you missed the point of the article i posted : these two incidents ( termination of previous contracts and in berlin re-purposing of empty flats with compensation and covered damages ) were very isolated and unique , hence the in-depth coverage . 
  this was done to make people scared of that happening near them and thus damage the administrative process by clogging it up with complaints of scared citizens . 
  translation : ______ the letter , which maybe hundreds received in the brandburg town of henningsdorf in the morning , appeared highly official . 
  the letterhead contained the logo of the county of oberhavel , the style is administratively neutral , the address data is correct . 
  even the signature of the signing official looked deceptively real . 
  in truth , the letter was a fake . 
  the \u201e dear ladies and gentlemen `` had surely , or so the letter began , read that the region is no longer capable of housing the growing number of asylum seekers . 
  thus the county would now ascertain how much room there is in privately-owned flats . 
  `` generally , twelve square meters are sufficient living space per person . 
  should you have more living space per person available at the moment , please report this immediately to the special service . '' the letter went on to claim that `` in this case '' housing the refugees `` within your flat '' would be necessary . 
  ** appeal to the citizens : ** what followed was a calculation and plea for understanding . 
  reactions were not long in coming . 
  in the time-frame of two hours the responsible official received 40-50 calls by angry citizens . 
  district chief executive ludger weskamp turned to the public with a clear statement : `` this is a very devious method to subvert the efforts of the county to house asylum seekers '' . 
  `` right-wing circles are trying to cripple administrative work , this way . '' he asked the people to not let themselves be deceived . 
  `` the majority of our society will not be impressed by these inhuman machinations '' . 
  the situation for housing was tense . 
  expropriation , however , was not planned . 
  that this was a targeted move by xenophobes is also indicated that , in dresden , an identical letter is in circulation . 
  according to information by radio dresden , unknown perpetrators spread the letter in the area near `` karlsruher stra\u00dfe '' . 
  here , too , letterhead and name of the responsible official were nearly perfectly faked . 
  in both cases , police is investigating . 
  ______ kind of a dick move , in my opinion . 
  edit : you can have a look at the fake letter yourself here : http://www.oberhavel.de/media/custom/2244_23748_1.pdf?1443171379, 
  they most likely thought this measure would save the most tax money ( true ) and dodges the most responsibility ( also true ) by shifting blame effectively on the refugees . 
  dumb decision by local government . 
  you made a very general statement , i gave a very general answer . 
  this case is special for a couple of reasons i gave above . 
  if you still think this is mistreatment of personal freedom , you can submit a verfassungsbeschwerde . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_notstandsgesetze https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/enteignung we have certain laws that put different personal liberties below the common good . 
  thing is , all other options ( building new housing , renting existing flats from private owners/companies ) are not possible due to time and cost constraints or even because the flat owner would not want refugees to live there . 
  the eigenbedarfsregelung is also a little more complicated than the telegraph makes it out to be . 
  rough translation : eigenbedarf applies when the lessor needs the ( whole ) flat for himself or for a person belonging to his household , like a caregiver or a family member that needs it for living purposes . 
  family members for whom 's benefit the lessor can terminate contracts in accordance with eigenbarf are , for example , parents or children of the lessor , grandchildren or siblings . 
  since a verdict from 27th of january 2010 this also applies to nephew and nieces . 
  the lesser must need the flat . 
  the pure wish to live in one 's own building is not sufficient . 
  eigenbedarf applies only when the lessor can give a comprehensible and sensible why he or a benefited person wishes to move into the flat . 
  this is the case if , for example , the lessor wishes to use the flat as a retirement home or if he wants to give it to his own children , because there is a danger the kid may abandon his family otherwise . 
  edit : downvotes for providing some background and actually translating something you can not find information about in english . 
  good one : , 
   geese and ganders ; this woman is soon to be out on the street , and who 's to say that she 'll have any better ability to find suitable housing , especially with the market turned on its head by the refugee housing crisis , already ? 
  the town says this , as all people who 's contract is thus terminated were and are given help to find new housing . 
  as my post below explains , this is a very unique case where the woman also has a dog and needs to find housing similar in quality and price that also allows dogs/is dog friendly . 
  literally everybody else found a flat pretty soon . 
   even in emergencies there is a law , and people have rights . 
  to suspend or alter them because the going 's gotten hard is not proper . 
  technically , emergencies would allow the state to expropriate anything deemed necessary . 
  luckily , this was not needed since the war , but it is in our law . 
  read on , please . 
  the existing flats are not owned by the municipality and the lessors can charge what they want from the town for renting them , or decide to not rent them out for refugee purposes at all . 
  town administration probably believed this to be the path of less costs and resistance and did not think too hard about publicity . 
   under this rationale , then , any corporations that own housing in germany could presumably do the same to their tenants and ` move in ' in their stead , thus effectively destroying an important aspect of tenants ' rights in the country . 
  no , this is simply not true . 
  germany does not do precedents in court , the law is actually very clear in it 's application to only natural persons and not entities . 
  every judge would probably throw a case where a company claimed to `` do it like the town '' out the window and fine their ass . 
  ( which is also why this case is even being discussed ) the sad fact is that this town is facing quite the emergency and all other options ( building new housing , renting existing flats from private owners/companies ) are not possible due to time and cost constraints or even because the flat owner would not want refugees to live there . 
  time to crosspost my tl , dr of the german article once more , as the telegraph omits some stuff and this is a ) not a classic case of eviction in any way and b ) very unique circumstances . 
  ____________________ this is about city-owned flats and the so-called `` eigenbedarfsregelung '' , which means that , if you rent out a flat to someone , you can terminate the contract with advance notice if you need the room ( s ) for yourself . 
  the problem is that this `` eigenbedarf '' only applies to actual people , not entities , so the entire thing is a bit wonky , legally speaking . 
  ** important : this is also not a decision by our nation 's government but by local city leaders . 
  basically , a spokesperson for the german tenants association said that this is a shit move by local government setting up refugees and citizens against each other while dodging responsibility . 
  and i agree . 
  the mayor justified this by saying that there is no money to build new housing and the empty flats around the city are `` not suitable '' . 
  _______________ what you should keep in mind , however , are three things : 1 . ), 
  that this measure was taken because the city already owned the flats and it is far simpler to convert existing housing , as private lessors may not want refugees in their houses as opposed to regular tenants . 
  all people who 's contract was terminated were given a very long advance notice , in this case 9 months 3 . ), 
  all tenants who 's contract was thus terminated received help with finding a new flat , this is the single case in which it was not as simple because the woman also owns a dog . 
  i mean to give some perspective here , not push an agenda . 
  if you feel you must downvote this post , please explain what you believe to not be true/relevant . 
  i included that anti-posts not being racist are high up , because outright racism is generally not tolerated . 
  i understand you are kind of angry about vote brigading , but come on . 
  do n't misrepresent what i said . 
  edit : ironically , this post is now -1 . :d, 
  when you call people opposing helping those in need `` generally idiots '' you are called a hippie and accused of killing our continent . 
  very useful indeed . 
  that 's a bit creepy , to say the least . 
  i would love to ask my fellow europeans about something , though . 
  was wondering about this for a few months now when i last saw the show , but could n't really be arsed to research this . 
   they also broadcast requests for clues in the television show `` aktenzeichen xy ... ungel\u00f6st '' [ file number xy . . unsolved ] '' which asked for public information in cases which the police found difficult to solve . 
  do you guys also have a tv show where police ask for clues about cold cases or maybe witnesses that could not come forward for fear of their lives , earlier ? 
  the show actually has a decent success rate . 
  yeah , that was a bit weird . 
  usually , the colors get more intense the stronger a point is . 
   this really applies to both sides of the `` argument '' so we have two options : we have a bigger anti-crowd ( as these posts are always pretty high up if they are not outright racist ) or the pro-crowd does not use downvotes as a `` i disagree '' button . 
   downvotes , really ? 
  dude , i translated a german article and gave some background yesterday ( the empty flats being re-purposed and the old lady that could not easily find a new flat after her contract was terminated with a 9 month advance notice because she has a dog ) , i did not even give any opinion , just the facts . 
  all of my comments have the `` controversial '' marker and most sit below -5 . 
  it is actually hilarious , because misrepresentation and fear mongering is upvoted to the top . 
  amazing , really .
