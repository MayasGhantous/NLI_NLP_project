  which will be a lot . 
  suffice to stay , nobody will be stolen from here . 
  which means the rent is adjusted to that generally common for flats of the same size and quality in the area .

  you probably do not know this , but unused luxury flats in cities and the higher rent this effective lack of living space causes was subject of many debates already . 
  since berlin is kind of overwhelmed at the moment and needs a clean short-term solution ( especially with winter coming up , making tent-cities much more difficult ) , it was decided to rent ( you know , for money , not expropriating ) these flats that were not in use anyway and actually do something with them instead of wasting valuable space . 
  the legal entity renting the place , in this case the state . 
  i also doubt that people will leave their gold-plated penis warmers lying around in there . 
  let 's clear some things up . 
  ** misconception : ** the flats are stolen from people . 
  not true . 
  the owners receive compensation ** misconception : ** people get kicked out . 
  not true . 
  the flats are empty and are basically owned as a second or third residence they hardly use by some very rich people . 
  ** misconception : ** this is something that will be applied nation-wide to all people not true . 
  this is a local , short-term solution to a very short-term problem . 
  ** misconception : ** this has anything to do with the other case where contracts were terminated according to `` eigenbedarf '' . 
  not true . 
  this was also an independent decision by local government . 
  see this for background : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m8fxc/f%c3%bcr_fl%c3%bcchtlinge_gek%c3%bcndigt_das_war_wie_ein_tritt/cvcvzv0, 
  this is about vacant apartments . 
  the other thing was wonky , legally speaking ( most likely , as eigenbedarf only applies to people , not entities like the city ) and is still being hotly discussed . 
   the german gov already threw out a lot of poor ppl from subsidized housing to make way for the migrants . 
  this is not true in any way . 
  there were not `` a lot of poor people '' . 
  the people were also not `` kicked out '' but rather their contract was terminated in accordance with the `` eigenbedarfsregelung '' and they do get help to relocate . 
  it was one shitty move by one mayor to dodge higher costs , not a nation-wide decision . 
  see my post for more background : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3m8fxc/f%c3%bcr_fl%c3%bcchtlinge_gek%c3%bcndigt_das_war_wie_ein_tritt/cvcvzv0 the article above , on the other hand , is about vacant , unused apartments . 
  since berlin is kind of overrun with the responsibility at the moment , this is a good short-term solution . 
  this is also not expropriation but rather a financially compensated emergency measure . 
  spreading misinformation helps nobody . 
  yes and no . 
  re-purposing the flats they now wish for tenants to vacate will also cost money . 
  and it would be far more sustainable and better for integration efforts to not force your own citizens to move while simultaneously shifting blame on the refugees . 
  nah , really not . 
  the city could just as easily have re-purposed many of the other ** empty ** flats and buildings or asked for more money to erect shelters . 
  this was what we call a `` dick move '' . 
  they actually just took the laziest possible route and wanted to shift blame on the refugees . 
  the mayor saying the empty buildings/flats were `` not suitable '' is at least in part untrue . 
  it usually goes like this : * national government : * we are taking in refugees . 
  they will be distributed to different federal states according to quotas . 
  * federal state government : * we got assigned a bunch of refugees which we will now distribute to different cities based on available facilities . 
  * city leaders ( with about a week of fore-warning ) : * fuuuuuuuuuck, 
  since the google translate thing is kind of terri-bad i 'll crosspost my tl , dr from the stern article . 
  this is about city-owned flats and the so-called `` eigenbedarfsregelung '' , which means that , if you rent out a flat to someone , you can terminate the contract with advance notice if you need the room ( s ) for yourself . 
  the problem is that this `` eigenbedarf '' only applies to actual people , not entities , so the entire thing is a bit wonky , legally speaking . 
  ** important : this is also not a decision by our nation 's government but by local city leaders . 
  basically , a spokesperson for the german tenants association said that this is a shit move by local government setting up refugees and citizens against each other while dodging responsibility . 
  and i agree . 
  the mayor justified this by saying that there is no money to build new housing and the empty flats around the city are `` not suitable '' . 
  that actually sounds super reasonable and doable . 
  when i then think of what a fucking nightmare it was for my sister to find even a daycare facility for her son last year and the prospect of probably having to do this shit myself in the next few years ... urgh . 
  most of it seems like we already have it , even . 
  just not good enough . 
  paternity leave came a few years ago on a large scale , i think . 
  anyway , thanks for that . 
  gon na read up some more on that . 
  got the study on that ? 
  i can not find solid numbers on this divided by immigrant group . 
   we should aim to adopt the french model on this i am not familiar with that , actually . 
  got something to read up on it ? 
  well , my plan to just forcibly impregnate every fertile female above 20 years of age was met with some resistance , as was just poking holes in all condoms . 
  you ca n't really force somebody to reproduce . 
  we already offer incentives and benefits for parents ( kindergeld for one , basically free money from the state for clothing and feeding kids , though it is not much ) , other than raising those significantly , we can not really do anything . 
  these weapons , btw , include a lot of refueling aircraft ( see picture ) and armoured scouting vehicles and such . 
  rough gist : the ministry insisted that for saudi-arabia there were no tanks or g36 rifles or other small arms included but rather deliveries to european partners like chassis for unarmed transport . 
  algeria , too , received unarmed trucks and radio equipment which raised the monetary value . 
  kuwait was cleared for receiving twelve `` fuchs '' armoured reconnaissance tanks . 
   a study published by the london school of economics earlier this year found that immigration to britain had not increased unemployment or reduced wages in areas where it had occurred . 
  and yet this is one of the most often used arguments when it comes to immigration and refugees . 
  what i also find rather amusing is the notion that people claim refugees will create dump wages around 1 $ / h citing the project where refugees are given jobs with a symbolic 1 $ payment to introduce them to the job market for a limited time until their work permit is processed and valid . 
  once they enter the job market with such a permit , employers are legally bound by the minimum wage of 8,50 $ / h. 
  they would thus not be any competition to german citizens on the job market if they are not significantly more skilled . 
  agreed . 
  as soon as they get their work permit , the companies are also bound by minimum wage . 
  these 1 $ introductory jobs you read are mainly to keep people busy and earn something extra * while they are being processed * . 
  a full job in the open market will make them at least minimum wage . 
  no exploitation possible , quite literally . 
  huh , quite possibly . 
  but since i am german i have no concept of irony or humour . 
   schadenfreude i will also never get over how cool it is you guys just appropriated this word . 
  it 's one of the best we have to offer , right after elefantenrennen ( `` elephant racing '' ) for a truck passing another on the highway with a 0.5 km/h speed difference . 
  then we fundamentally disagree about what schools are in modern times . 
  they are not only there to teach you basic skills like math , writing and foreign languages . 
  they also prepare you for life , a job and adult responsibilities . 
  and children spend more time in school today than they did even 10 years ago . 
  it makes sense to also tackle serious topics in an engaging fashion . 
  if you leave it to their parents back home , some kids may never get to talk about it and end up feeling super lost . 
  especially since suicide ( in this case ) is a social taboo and they might not feel comfortable talking to their friends or family about it . 
  an abstract setting like school helps with self-reflection . 
  http://www.nasponline.org/resources/crisis_safety/suicide-resources.aspx the `` research '' portion of this website gives some great papers about suicide in school-aged kids and prevention methods . 
  many suggest directly engaging children about it . 
  obviously this specific method is not mentioned in detail , but in my opinion it 's a pretty creative exercise and , with the right context , can help the kids understand consequences and why it is important to get help . 
  i am going to assume the assignment did not happen with the teacher walking in , saying `` write a suicide note while thinking of your mom '' and walking out . 
  a good teacher will give information to students first and allow them to contextualize this .
