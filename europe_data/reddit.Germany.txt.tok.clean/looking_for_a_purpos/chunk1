if you czechs are ever in any trouble and need refuge , you can go fuck yourself . 
  i dislike when the church indoctrinates young children like this . 
  children are manipulated very easily . 
  they believe almost everything you teach them . 
  that is why people should chose their religion as adults . 
  when they are educated . 
  also : religion needs to be kept out of school . 
  it is a private thing . 
  and the way they have to sit on the ground looks kind of submissive . 
  that is no way to treat a child . 
  except for the pedophile on the left . 
  wow , really disturbing . 
  wow , great photos . 
  i really like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/woaisqj.jpg ) . 
   is about 10 times the size of austria . 
  4 times . 
  people like you are disgusting . 
  looks like an animal that is shitting to me . 
  the percentage of female politicians in there is quiet unusual . 
  proof that attractiveness has nothing to do with skin color . 
  ( also : we need a picture for clarification . ), 
  oats , fruits , nuts and seeds . 
  berlin is just dirty and disgusting . 
  full of hipsters running a `` startup '' . 
  their politicians ca n't handle money and larger infrastructure projects . 
  i 'm a vegan but i 'm quiet about it . 
  if you would meet me , you would n't know until we eat together . 
  they tried to establish a word for [ no longer being thirsty ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sitt ) , because the german language was missing it . 
  but i do n't think anyone is using it . 
  do you actually use megaoctet ? 
  dammit , that is a sin . 
  pretty : anything southern bavaria . 
  ( e.g. 
  mittenwald , bad t\u00f6lz ) ugly : berlin fight me irl !, 
  there is nothing ugly in italy . 
  murder rate , gun ownership , trespassing laws and this strange criminal offense called `` conspiracy to commit x '' . 
  not really . 
  the us is scary and the entry-checks are off-putting . 
  i do n't eat animals . 
  oats with bananas and flax-seed . 
  so that we can annex all their gorgeous mountains . 
  i do n't mind high temperatures . 
  ( i was born in the wrong country , i know . ), 
  but why is that ? 
  are people not motivated to be successful and thrive ? 
  driving a car for days needlessly is a waste of gas and produces a lot of co2 . 
   snowden = schneewittchen did n't see this before . 
  the merkel ^ tm . 
  now i wan na see the statistics for the us as a comparison . 
  i had no idea croatia was so backwards and corrupt . 
  having sheep inside fences is like delivering them on a plate . 
  if we would n't enclose the sheep , they could run away and the wolfs would only get the slowest one . 
  as nature intended . 
  kristina schr\u00f6der is fugly . 
  we 've got nothing even close to that . 
  women looking like that would be considered models over here . 
  [ volker bouffier ] ( http://static.memrise.com/uploads/things/images/33877499_140606_1303_52.jpg ), 
  we love austria . 
  the mountains , lakes and such . 
  can we have them ? 
  tits and asses . 
  hmm ... i wonder how [ these vegan body builders ] ( http://www.greatveganathletes.com/bodybuilders ) are able to keep building muscle then . 
  fyi : [ prague ranks among world 's most vegan-friendly cities ] ( https://www.expats.cz/prague/article/weekly-czech-news/prague-ranks-among-worlds-most-vegan-friendly-cities/ ), 
   that eating meat is sorta a must . 
  lol , no . 
  you need to educate yourself on that topic . 
  as you know germans are efficient . 
  we want to avoid the usual follow-up question : `` am i speaking to mr x ? '' . 
  that 's why we say our last name when answering . 
  i never peel my potatoes . 
  as a cyclist i do n't trust cars with drivers . 
  i do n't see the difference . 
  both animals want to live . 
  animals are killed and eaten by the millions . 
  i like the ones with instant obesity flavor . 
  exactly the opposite . 
  riva and torbole got all the surfers , mountain bikers and hikers . 
  the old folks are bathing in the sun at the south end . 
  no entrance fees though . 
  go on a ski-vacation and have a blast . 
  italy , hands down . 
  it 's just so diverse . 
  mountains , lakes , beaches , beautiful cities -- it has it all . 
  the weather . 
  the mood of people . 
  i can not differentiate between scandinavian languages because i have n't been traveling there yet . 
  i 'm also having trouble with eastern european languages . 
  i might be able to recognize polish at most . 
  in case anyone wants to educate themselves : [ 32 spoken languages of europe ] ( https://youtu.be/-y3kzibhn8o ), 
  that was very interesting . 
  thanks . 
  the most beautiful places are outside of the cities . 
  mountains , lakes , forests and such . 
  north sea and east sea borders are going to change due to the rising sea level . 
  animals are killed and tortured by the millions every year . 
  [ here is how we treat them ] ( https://youtu.be/zpj4apu-kuw ) . 
  hummus and cucumber or smoked tofu , mustard and lettuce . 
   the country that gave us mozart , his balls ... well played !, 
  vitamix . 
  yeah it 's pretty much forever uncool .
