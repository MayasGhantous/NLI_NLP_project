this is easy to say when you 're just a mini-negotiator on reddit which we have plenty of from both sides , but real negotiators will actually have to make compromises . 
  and probably both sides will have to concede something they thought impossible to concede before , otherwise there 'll just be no treaty . 
   they want a smaller eu as well , with less members . 
  well at least we 're making progress on that front !, 
  i agree , i have moved past feeling personally offended by what politicians say but this is a pretty dumb thing to say . 
  we do n't want to coerce people stay with us , we just want to have a good offer for them . 
  if it is actually better for them to leave the eu , then they should do it . 
  what matters are the people and not some artificial constructs like the eu ( or nations too , for that matter ) . 
  europe will still be there tomorrow even if the eu is n't . 
  just as much as the british people will still be there tomorrow even if the uk is n't . 
  this sounds cute , but also not realistic . 
  i wonder how the economy would like it if every few years the country could turn upside down though . 
  maybe they 'd make contracts/laws with the nation to protect their interests , and when the next `` government '' comes up it will just find out it can not do as much because acting capability is very restricted by all these contracts/laws . 
  at some point everything is so complicated that drafted-by-lot people hardly have any choice but to bend to the `` establishment '' ( while the drafted politicians come and go , experts , lobbyists etc. 
  will stay the same ) in every legislative period and the people would be just as unhappy as they are now . 
  : / people . 
   was he supposed to stay on , even though he 's against the whole thing ? 
  it 's not unlikely that another remain campaigner becomes the next pm , so if that happens , frankly , yes ? 
  david cameron could have done it just as well . 
  yeah build a wall around these europeans !, 
  they come here , take our jobs , shoot people in gay bars and what not . 
  f * cking islamist commies . 
  that 's why i said they are n't officially anti eu yet . 
  still , their reactions after the brexit : beatrix von storch , one of their leading members , said she cried of joy when brexit happened , she called it a `` historical day '' , said it was the `` independence day of the united kingdom '' and that other countries would follow now too . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvzwqoy56a4 ) ) j\u00f6rg meuthen , another leading member , said after the brexit , he 'd also like a referendum for germany and the eu should become a `` europe of the motherlands '' . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.swp.de/ulm/nachrichten/suedwestumschau/afd-will-nach-brexit-besinnung-auf-europa-der-vaterlaender;art1157835,3903484 ) ) alexander gauland said , they do n't want to advertise an exit now , but the eu should develop backwards to a mere economic union . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/fn-afd-fpoe-und-co-rechtspopulisten-feiern-brexit-votum/13782944.html ) ) and of course bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke - not a leading member but a regional afd politician - bluntly said how awesome brexit is and we should do the same . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4asgtsbbbq ) ) what is already officially part of their program : abolishment of the euro currency . 
  i have little doubt that they 'll go full anti eu if they think they get more votes with it . 
  it would be good if they stopped then . 
  but to my knowledge they do n't . 
  they just keep on killing with nothing to gain really . 
  the situation in germany is that we have no anti eu parties in the parliament . 
  the afd is according to the latest polls somewhere between 10 % -15 % , which means they will most likely be in after the next election in 2017 . 
  the party is n't officially anti eu yet , however at least one of their leading staff has declared her sympathies with the brexiters , the other 's are being cautious . 
  given their development i am suspecting they would fully jump on the anti eu bandwagon , if they smell public support . 
  referenda are not a part of our constitution , so , surprise accidents like we 're seeing them in other countries are extremely unlikely . 
  i can agree with the color if you have a extremely cautious interpretation of `` influence on the government policy '' and a broad definition of euroscepticism . 
  and the most important question : can we blame the eu ? 
  * * as i write this i just noticed it was already answered further down the comments section . 
  thanks obama . 
  je suis brussels is n't either . 
  once terror becomes the norm , public attention ca n't be bothered with it anymore . 
  to be fair , most of them are n't regretting it yet . 
  i 've seen leavers saying they are completely fine with reducing their life standard in exchange for their freedom , whatever that might mean . 
  will probably take a few years until we can see a genuine reaction from the island . 
  as of now , it seems more like eu citizens and remainers repeatingly congratulating themselves for being right . 
  well we can probably learn a lot from the us propaganda office if presidential candidates like hillary clinton and donald trump can convince 300 million americans that their vote does n't dilute into nothingness and that they are close to the power center . 
  i feel like there is n't any meaningful thing for cameron to say left . 
  all he did in the uk parliament today was referring to his successor in the matter . 
  if he 's going to do the same in brussels that 's going to be an awkward talk . 
  well having had a short look at his comment history my guess is portugal now . 
  when the soviet union fell apart the nato also announced it would n't expand to the east ... 
  when the euro was introduced it was announced there never would be transfers from one euro country to the other . 
  people announce things all the time , it 'd be naive to take those things for granted , even foolish when announced by a pm who just quit over the whole thing . 
  since david cameron plans to resign the first thing we need to do is wait until the uk has a government capable of acting again and then we 'll see what they have to say and decide how we go from there . 
  maybe they come up with something interesting , but as far as i am informed , until now , the leavers have no plan . 
  i agree with the conclusions , but i do n't see any uk leader who really believes in `` leave '' and wants to get it done with ( yet ) . 
  so i do not imagine those talks would be very fruitful or create any kind of stability . 
  how do we , how does the world economy know that the uk will actually follow up with leaving instead of having these informal talks for the next 30 years ? 
  there will be no certainty about the leave until article 50 is triggered , and i do n't think those talks will get us there any faster . 
  how so ? 
  which country is that ? 
  well considering that trying to cater towards uks special needs ( and those special needs unfortunately most of the time seemed to mean : less of this eu thing , no euro , no schengen ) culminated in this referendum with this result , i am not sure if it was the right thing to do or if the whole special treatment actually helped the nationalists feel empowered and gain momentum . 
  i mean it would be alright if it worked out that way , but it did n't . 
  so basically most of you guys have a unanimous general idea of the spot queensland has in the commonwealth of australia , which is what i expected . 
  that 's all i 'm asking of the brits : do you think you belong in the european union or not ? 
  both on an individual level as on the government level , because the whole country seem to have been avoiding this fundamental question for the longest time using the answer to it mostly as a leverage for striking deals . 
  now , we seem to be getting an answer from them , but the same question is still to be asked for countries who might wish to join or even some of those who are already in . 
  so let me ask you a question , how often do australians debate the matter of queensland leaving australia ? 
  or is it just so , that australians have made their mind up about queensland being a part of the commonwealth of australia a long time ago ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  only saw the last 10 minutes , is there going to be a vod of it ? 
  i know the vote , but i 'm not sure if the uk ( the government ) will follow that vote ultimately , or if they will have another referendum or whatever crazy things might happen . 
  i 'll believe it when they actually set the leave process in motion , which has n't happened yet . 
  he does n't sound like a brit anyways . 
  he sounds like some eastern european troll who hopes to throw oil in the fire to help starting some anti eu chain reaction . 
  as a german , i fully agree with that . 
  the uk finally has to make their mind up : ** in ** or ** out ** . 
  we would like in , we will accept out , but everything in the middle has been weakening the eu for long enough now . 
  for having to live with the decision the longest , the youngest people seemed to be pretty chill about the outcome . 
  man it must suck to be a brit on / r/europe these days . 
  i 'd feel personally offended all the time even though it 's just directed towards the country . 
  but i agree with you . 
  i see no chance that after uk leaving germany will come to the conclusion that `` hey let 's ignore our remaining big partner in the eu now ! '', 
  will be a good idea . 
  sure they think that . 
  after the good old tradition of threatening the eu to leave , they will soon reveal their new negotiation strategy : threatening the eu to stay . 
   britain is like `` it 's not you , its me '' we have a complete inverse perceiption of what 's happening here . 
  it might be the `` remain '' side who had this message towards the eu , but britain = leave side , at least that 's what they determined in the referendum and should accept as reality . 
  europe is reacting towards the leave side now ... and they just said `` fuck the eu ! '', 
  man i 'm glad we can be good cop for once . 
  and of course we are on the same side , why would n't we be ? 
  we 're on the eu side of things ... 
  it 's almost like you 're telling your spouse you want a divorce , but clearly not move out of the house , until you are ready , in a few years maybe . 
  charming . 
  i do n't think it 's all swedes who are doing this to be fair . 
  i think the best thing for the eu is just treat them as a normal member until they actually decide to trigger article 50 . 
  i would n't even do any serious exit negotiations before that . 
  it 's not our business if they lie to their voters and do n't fulfill their promises to them .
