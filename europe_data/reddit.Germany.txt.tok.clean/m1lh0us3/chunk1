[ die kassierer - das schlimmste ist wenn das bier alle ist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj1_jprkeic ) translation : the worst is , when the beer is gone, 
  nah , munich people are rooting for tsv 1860 . 
  it 's mostly people from other parts of bavaria who like fc bayern, 
  i love black metal :(, 
  with the rise of crossfit , those stupid crossfitters take the names of exercises which are known here over a hundred years and rebrand them with the english name . 
  what 's even more retarded that they use stupid imperial lengths and weights . 
  how i hate these people ... 
  lviv is awesome , can recommend . 
  i 'm feeling myself there more at home than in other parts of germany . 
  might come from the shared german dialect and the history of austria/bavaria . 
  munich resident here , yes come come . 
  lots of americans in bavaria already , 
  here 's the [ german national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8xvkjqehq ) . 
  as a bavarian i have to mention the [ bayernhymne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djmvxubdms0 ) . 
  i do n't like it though , to much reference on religion . 
   and most importantly ( though i do n't know how popular these are ) , the german toilet . 
  huh . 
  care to explain ? 
  my guess is you 're refering to the infamous * flachsp\u00fcler * . 
  well , that kind of toilet is hardly produced and installed anymore . 
  i just love their accent , their food , the alps . 
  well austrians are like cousins to us bavarians . 
  salo all the way !, 
  nope nope nope . 
  what ? 
  then you got the wrong dish ... 
  well that could be bavarian as well , 
  what ? 
  wolfsb ** u ** rg, 
  and construct additional pylons ? 
  only a minority of the people i know still believe in a god . 
  i guess catholicism in bavaria is dying out too . 
  [ piraten-wiki ] ( https://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wahlen/europa/2014 ) [ top-candidate julia reda ] ( https://www.piratenpartei.de/2014/01/07/piraten-fuer-europa-unsere-spitzenkandidatin-julia-reda/ ) links in german ... 
  i 'm in germany , so our elections are on sunday . 
  but because i 'm not at home at this time , i voted yesterday per mail . 
  it was a hard decision between pirates and die partei . 
  i went with piraten though , those top candidates seem pretty knowledgeable to me . 
  that we wear lederhosen all the time . 
  nope . 
  ah well , cdu and fdp are obviously pro ttip . 
  spd wants further negotiations afaik . 
  but the smaller parties are against it . 
  maybe check out wahl-o-mat for details . 
  seen this here , what a shame : /, 
  well , 0,3 l and 0,2 l are also often found . 
  well , it is not law yet ... 
  bonn ? 
  zensursula anyone ? 
  yeah , i had the same impression the first time i was in lissabon !, 
  not long ago a large group of friends and i were in lissabon and we thought people are speaking russian , wtf . 
  stop crossposting that . 
  nothing to do with europe or germany whatsoever . 
   beautiful women really ? 
  guess the lawn is always greener on the other side . 
   no one really plays sport in germany ( except football ) . 
  excuse me , but what ? 
  the sports clubs and gyms here in munich are packed . 
  the stereotypes i often read and hear about bavaria : * the texas of germany * ca n't speak german properly * very conservative * dumb * always wearing dirdnl and lederhosen, 
  i never heard that anyway . 
  my mother was working too when i was a child . 
  i feels you :(, 
  le sweden is reddit utopia , is it not ? 
  crazy housing prices and no more appartments for rent in prospering cities like munich or hamburg . 
  a keg of beer . 
  prefered a 1 l glass ( called ` mass ' ) over here . 
  that one looks shopped , 
  i know that , but either cuisines share a lot of similarities . 
  let me fix this : [ schweinshax ` n ] ( http://www.schmankerltest.de/bilder/schweinshaxe-schmankerl-stubn.jpg ) with some [ augustiner edelstoff ] ( http://www.getraenke-vogl.de/images/augustiner-edelst-1-.jpg ) . 
  after this some [ kaiserschmarrn ] ( http://blog.rezkonv.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/kaiserschmarrn-3_sm.jpg ), 
  german is not a roman language . 
  also melodic death metal !, 
  and thanks for all the fish, 
  * potato, 
  need to reinforce freedom . 
  for allah !, 
  umm , just as any other userflairs here ? 
  honestly it 's a while now , so i ca n't really remember , but it is not difficult . 
  in german nouns are written with a capital first letter , so `` orange '' would be correct . 
  same here, 
  u/coffeh can into space !, 
  i have to cringe for my country . 
  who the fuck gives his son the name finn/fynn or mia ? 
  i would suggest munich , pretty similar to vienna too . 
  arts and music here is top notch , also the bierg\u00e4rten in the summer are the best invention ever . 
  vienna/munich co-capital and a `` wet '' friendship ? 
  sounds intriguing . . 
  austria and south-tyrolia ( is this correct in english ? ), 
  obviously , because we want to separate from germany/italy and found a new bavarese empire !, 
  aah my lovely city of munich , 
  also young people tend to study at universities . 
  lots of smaller businesses fail to get youth into aprenticeships , because young people do not want to do manual labor anymore . 
  this is where immigrants come in . 
  not true, 
  also germany 's population is declining and old . 
  we need people for the economy . 
  i always have to upvote potato jokes, 
   not proven . 
  eu insists that food standards will not be lowered . 
  yeah yeah ...  basically none of these cases has been won so far . 
  does n't matter .
