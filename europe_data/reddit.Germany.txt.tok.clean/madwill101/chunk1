interesting that someone with your username wants to keep us docile ... also , last time we tried , we got bombed the fuck out of , split into pieces , and left with huge bills , along with the title of `` worst nation in living memory '' . 
  not again thanks . 
  i 'll go back to my goose-stepping and killing everyone who does n't agree with me . 
  as a german with a gay best friend . 
  fuck you . 
  also you have * no * fucking idea about history . 
  seriously , that word gets thrown around way too much . 
  hugo boss , no less . 
  yeah , but anything is better than nothing !, 
  ( apart from the palast der republik , that thing was hideous ! ), 
  they 're currently rebuilding the berlin stadtschloss . 
  i 'm on my phone so ca n't get a link , but it was demolished by the soviets to make way for the * palast der republik *, 
  yup , humans came from where ethiopia is now , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  african-european , probably . 
  come to think of it , that 's more offensive sounding than `` black '' . 
  especially for the people with zero connection to africa whatsoever , save for some ancestors who came here . 
  reading about how we are rebuilding them all makes me happy , though !, 
  i 'm not particularly a tv watcher , but i do see the headlines of the sun / star / mirror / daily mail / express / telegraph / evening standard when i walk by . 
  it almost seems to be a competition between them to see who can spout more hatred about the eu . 
  generally the daily mail wins . 
  i live in the uk , so it ranges from minor euroscepticism to extreme euroscepticism . 
  articles appear pretty much daily . 
  facts do not particularly bother the local media , so long as they can make an article that adds to hatred of the eu . 
  indeed . 
  i know , the nazis were assholes , particularly in the east . 
  the same as terrorists today , destroying human history for no reason other than blind hatred . 
  i 'm just glad that we had enough photos and stuff to be able to rebuild them . 
  like the [ frauenkirche ] ( http://mtprofi.ru/profi/tours_tp/sights/foto/germany/dresden/frauenkirche_dresden/referenzen_quartier_iii_frauenkirche_dresden.jpg ) ( granted that one was by allied bombing and not an intended target , but still ) in dresden . 
  they charge on the m6 too ;-), 
  yep : - / i 'm from just north of the swiss border , so when going to italy it worked out easier and cheaper overall for us to go just south of the border , get in my friend 's swiss-registered car , which had all the autobahn stickers anyway due to his work , and continue to italy that way . 
  saved a few hours and we gave him plenty of gas money to make it fair . 
   if people from other countries want to pay what ? 
  i 'm trying to think of which people on foreign plates actually think `` oh , i want to spend more on traveling to my destination '' ? 
  what a beautiful piece of art . 
  it 's a shame that none of the originals survived , but i love that we can recreate some of them . 
  i was actually born near it , so it 's always been a favourite of mine . 
  [ it is open to the public through guided tours ] ( http://www.burg-hohenzollern.com/startpage.html ) , which is pretty awesome considering it 's privately owned . 
  in another country , the hungarian parliament building . 
  i 'm from southern baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , it 's the same here . 
  a black guy who was on exchange from the usa got asked for his papers 3 times in one night . 
  he was just walking down the street at night . 
  pretty sad actually . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179902/revealed-the-secret-report-shows-nazis-planned-fourth-reich--eu.html ) !, 
  you have to love how much the daily mail go out of their way to stir hatred for the eu . 
  they even write their own back-story for it since they could n't find any facts to base it on . 
  sorry brits , but if we were going to take you over like that , we would have done it a long time ago . 
  the hitler government never had a plan to covertly take you over economically , and if it did the nazis would have resurfaced during the economic miracle . 
  sorry to disappoint you . 
  as a piece of fiction however , it looks like a beginning to one of those alternate-history articles . 
  not particularly well written , but it 's a start . 
  i 've met some very friendly people from bulgaria , and i hear the beer makes us look expensive !, 
  there was an article published years ago by the daily mail ( of course . 
  who else ? ), 
  that said that they had seen letters which showed that in the final days of wwii , the nazi high command , along with the leaders of german businesses such as ig farben ( now bayer and basf , predominantly ) , krupp , deutsche bank , daimler , volkswagen , etc , held a conference in secret about the plans for after the war . 
  the plan the mail came up with is that leading nazis would say they were forced into nazism , and would then , under the guise of trying to make amends , form a political and economic union with france , italy , belgium etc. 
  they would use this to bide their time until germany was once again a superpower , dominating europe , at which point the nazis would return to power , driving the european superstate into the 4th reich . 
  i wonder if this is where a lot of the daily mail readers get their ideas about the eu from ? 
  ** edit : ** [ found the link again !, 
  ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179902/revealed-the-secret-report-shows-nazis-planned-fourth-reich--eu.html ), 
  having just read about him , i 'm wish i could say i 'm surprised that such an evil , venomous man writes for the daily mail , or has been part of the sky news team . 
  i * love * weihenstephan beer . 
  apparently the oldest brewery in the world . 
  it 's the best wheat beer going , that 's for sure . 
  i love the dutch for their friendly ways . 
  i was there in the summer , and some british `` lads '' came in . 
  one started mouthing off that his beer had a head on it and got back in the friendliest way `` it 's supposed to have a head . 
  look here , the line is 500ml , we then let a head grow on top . 
  glasses are bigger here you do n't fill it to the brim . '', 
  another guy ( i think he was saudi , by his mannerisms and dress sense ) , came in and looked awkwardly around . 
  the barman did n't even bother asking , just said `` this is a bar , for getting drunk on alcohol . 
  if you want to go get high go to the coffee shop across the road . '', 
  ** the uk ** has the nicest pubs ever . 
  also a fried breakfast can not be beaten . 
  ** italy ** has some of the most beautiful cities in the world , and one of the friendliest cultures . 
  also rimini/riccione is the best place in the world for parties . 
  ** austria ** , the world thanks you for apfelstrudel . 
  ** switzerland ** , those mountains . 
  what more can i say ? 
  ** france ** , thank you for champagne and cheese . 
  feels good to be south german . 
  also , whats going on in scotland ? 
  having just seen [ this article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29776970 ) i really do think the british are going to end up leaving everything entirely and trying to negotiate seperate treaties with each and every country . 
  it seems that 's going to be only the only way to satisfy the mail , express and farage . 
  pity really , the british phrase `` cutting off your nose to spite your face '' ( also known as `` shooting yourself in the foot '' ) come to mind . 
  i 'm not sure when the freedom of movement to the united states ended . 
  i know i have some family there , but maybe the us was more accepting to people leaving germany in the 1930s due to what was going on . 
  i have no idea when it ended there if i 'm honest . 
   in a way , this opening up of borders is a return to the past . 
  prior to the start of world war i in 1914 , there were virtually no border controls or restrictions to labor mobility across the continent . 
  during the war , however , the crossing of borders by foreigners began to be considered a security concern , and it was at this time that passports and visas were introduced in europe . 
   then in the 1950s , when europe was beginning to recover from the devastation of world war ii and experiencing a period of intense economic growth , labor mobility was again encouraged . 
  because the lack of skilled workers was seen as a threat to the economy , freedom of movement of qualified industrial workers was included in the treaties founding the european economic community ( eec ) , the predecessor of the current european union , in 1957 [ sourced from the migration policy institute , written in 2011 ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/free-movement-europe-past-and-present ) however this is a secondary source . 
  the primary source would be the treaty of rome ( 1957 ) , avalible [ here ] ( http://europa.eu/eu-law/decision-making/treaties/index_en.htm ) . 
  also thats not an eu thing , or even a new thing . 
  its been around since the 1950s . 
  unless britain wants to cut all ties and negotiate seperate deals with each and every country ... actually better not say that out loud . 
  the daily mail will be demanding it asap . 
  another problem solves itself . 
  we do not . 
  the german state refuses to acknowledge the existence of ballermann , or rimini .
