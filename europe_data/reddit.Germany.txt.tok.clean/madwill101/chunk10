  in germany they would get so many tickets for both driving too fast and too slow . 
  i got used to it pretty fast , it was more difficult converting my speed into miles than driving on the left . 
  i expect its much easier in a uk car than a german one too . 
  had to ask my passenger to check when it was clear to overtake . 
  on a related note , people of the uk , what is with those people who drive at 40mph in a 60 zone , then straight through a 30 zone at 40mph ? 
  its good for cycling and ... umm ... yeah ... 
  going past on my way to drink at my friend 's place in sigmaringen . 
  t\u00fcbingen is much more fun . 
  i personally think that , the way they go on about immigrants , kirsten mehr-farage should be the first person deported straight back to frankfurt where she belongs . 
  after all the woman is a german citizen , paid for by government to be working as her husband 's secretary and dey turk uhr jerrrrrrrrbssss, 
  do n't forget also that it was going against the uk * and * russia at the same time that caused the previous downfalls . 
  napoleon and hitler made the same mistake there . 
  [ the blue bit was prussia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/kgrwuerttemberg.png ) as well . 
  its not in any way attached to the rest of prussia though , so easy to not have known . 
  i 'm from the cream coloured bit around it . 
  people are quite proud up/down/over here haha , 
  i live near there , you get a pretty fantastic view of it on the train as you pass hechingen , and the bicycle routes around the area are pretty good . 
  also the nearby [ schloss sigmaringen ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/schloss_sigmaringen_nw.jpg ) is pretty nice . 
  it 's in hohenzollern ( which was part of prussia ) . 
  never call it baden unless you want to piss off the locals . 
  source : live a few km away from hechingen , in w\u00fcrttemberg . 
  i love the older style , particularly the ones in lisbon and belgrade . 
  modern trams just look so out of place to me . 
  true , but its a good starting point . 
  i know the same phrase can mean * very * different things on either side of the atlantic . 
  how a brit might ask for a cigarette means something completely different stateside ... 
  honestly that 's the same wherever you go in northern / central europe . 
  source : walked to the store for some bread in the sunshine , walked back home in a thunderstorm today . 
  nice !, 
  for the true experience , try the [ canstatter volksfest ] ( http://cannstatter-volksfest.de/en/landing-page/ ) , it 's basically oktoberfest without the stag parties . 
  you will come away with a massive hangover , a lighter wallet , and [ singing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tytjzbjzbek ) [ these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhmwvtvjbpm ) [ wonderful ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vjnaladw7q ) [ songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62_wr5id-0s ) . 
  prost !, 
  german is the most widely spoken mother tongue in europe , and is used a lot for business . 
  if you speak english and german , businesses will love you , and its honestly not so different from english once you start learning it . 
  just make sure you are learning * hochdeutsch * and not some regional dialect . 
  i personally can not understand a word that people from some parts of switzerland or saxony or bavaria say . 
  not only is the accent different but words and grammar are completely different . 
  will agree on that one . 
  i heard a lot of jokes about americans but i also heard a lot about germans , and the french , and the irish ... and everyone else including the british . 
  seems so long as you do n't take yourself too seriously the british are pretty cool to be around , plus you guys speak * almost * the same language so its much easier to integrate . 
  has to be london for this round . 
  sometimes the original outdoes all copies . 
  [ moscow ] ( http://www.bestplacesin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/moscow_metro_waldenpond-e1276526287343.jpg ) and [ stockholm ] ( http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/stockholm-metro-station-ceiling-cave-light-blue-photograph-chase-lindberg.jpg ) win for architecture though . 
  now * that * is cool . 
  i love london for its unique towers in the business district . 
  some cities are so soulless . 
  i prefer [ our comms tower ] ( http://www.der-fernsehturm.de/images/berliner-fernsehturm5.jpg ) over [ yours ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/bt_tower.jpg ) though . 
  as for looks , poland , uk and sweden win it in this round for me . 
  most of the rest are depressing to look at for me . 
  i prefer all this to political debates . 
  we have the nicest , spain and nl are rather ... interesting design choices , and i do like the style of the old eastern bloc ... 
  * sigh * third time is not going to be the lucky one , is it ? 
  bring it on , paddy . 
  old jerry has some fine grass over here . 
  please . 
  have you seen our grass ? 
  currently says cloud with rain tomorrow , 
  coming tomorrow , grass of europe . 
  i love the austrian , french , hungarian and british buildings . 
  very grand and very iconic . 
  i think ours is awesome also because it shows our nations history and struggles within it . 
  not really a fan of the soviet modernist styles though . 
  [ the sixties ? 
  my old city was in colour in the 1930s !, 
  ] ( http://timelifeblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/05_31-46b.jpg?w=729 ) i guess your city is also a little behind on the times . 
  here in my town in germany we have all bendy buses , but we also have wide roads and intersections rather than roundabouts . 
  i was glad to hear they retired them all from service in london . 
  london 's roads are not suitable for something 18m long . 
  one that was already mentioned but i 've heard it :  englishman stops for a drink in germany , and starts to drink from a river . 
  german guy sees him and shouts `` achtung !, 
  ( careful , that 's a sewer ! ), 
  english guy shouts back `` ca n't understand you mate !, 
  english ! '', 
  german shouts back `` sorry engl\u00e4nder !, 
  i said use both hands to drink , its much easier ! '', 
  also  england , the only country that works better in a world war than during a light snowstorm and  england vs germany in football is such a big game ... for england . 
  finally  how do you make english beer ? 
  * pretend to piss into a bottle *, 
  ** france : ** german cars are so efficient , you can go from berlin to paris with a single tank . 
  french rifle for sale : never fired , dropped once . 
  ** bavaria : ** `` i miss germany '' - `` where are you now ? '', 
  - `` bavaria '' ** usa : ** a guy who speaks three languages is called trilingual , two languages is bilingual , and one language is american . 
  ** austria : ** the best achievement of austria is convincing everyone else that beethoven was austrian and that hitler was german . 
  [ 50 shades of angie ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/19/article-0-141d942d000005dc-663_964x1353.jpg ), 
  you mean reserved for when the english are around ? 
  whenever the hannovarians are around i suddenly `` forget '' every word of hochdeutsch . 
  i normally despise the daily mail and anything that comes out of it , but . . well he backed that one up with facts . 
  i do n't need any political commentary from him but it is interesting to see what the eu says and coming to your own conclusions . 
  bosch and mercedes benz being the first two i can think of . 
  the question being , will it still be cheaper to produce there ? 
  i hope for your sakes it is . 
  wtf , reminds me of [ nazi king ] ( http://www.eddiebear.com/germany/various/012nurnberg.jpg ) , somewhere on the rally grounds in n\u00fcrnberg . . 
  it 's going to be pretty hard to move towards greater integration with them in the middle of it being no part of it !, 
  at least with iceland , norway , uk etc they are on the ( geographical ) fringes !, 
  * sigh * i love your country but i do worry about it 's future . 
  i can see a lot of german businesses deciding the cost of having factories in a non-eu state so close to home is not worth it , shutting down and moving to the netherlands . 
  having lived in the area of the uk called `` outside of london '' , which is an area that uk politicians often forget exists , i wonder what the rest of the country thinks of this . 
  never been , could n't comment . 
  hear its awesome from people who have gone there ( turkish or otherwise ) 2 . 
  you guys are pretty cool , and the food you brought to this country is amazing .
