  go for it , but your government needs to change and conform to the eu norms and values first . 
  this is no place for that government . 
  he needs to go . 
  secularism is where its at . 
  do n't really know much about him , but if he made the country secular he 's good by me . 
  far too much crap comes from when religion and the state combine , be that religion islam , christianity , judaism , whatever . 
  ah awesome !, 
  honestly the stereotype of how we are is mostly bavaria , mostly munich to be precise . 
  damn they drink a lot in munich . 
  not nearly `` camp '' enough is the problem !, 
  honestly send some of those folks from the x-factor auditions . 
  the `` special '' ones . 
  put them all in spandex and blast them with a wind machine . 
  please keep sending your worst performers to eurovision . 
  the whole thing just gets seen as a bit of a joke here ; it 's funny how serious some countries take it . 
  on a related note , terry wogan was pure hilarious as a commentator for it . 
  never heard a tv / radio personality making it so plainly obvious that he hated having to do it . 
  that 's our job . 
  we just like to dance on tables in leather shorts ... 
  it 's just occurred to me how that sounds ... 
  i live not far from the stretch of the a8 you 're describing , that 's pretty normal , going from full speed to a crawl in seconds , hitting the warning light , then back up to speed . 
  also going right up to the top speed of the car , overtaking many trucks , then slamming on the brake on the offramp . 
  i hate the autobahnen personally . 
  people have no idea how to control their cars sometimes . 
  eurgh :( i hate it like that , how am i supposed to go fast if caravans keep getting in my way !, 
  true . 
  actually i laughed at that idea . 
  `` and here are the baboons , and here is hitler , on the left are the pandas ... '', 
  i think it would be best if they removed the `` advisory '' 130km/h limit , that is more for insurers who want to void your life insurance . 
  i think they need to just say `` germans drive ** fast ** , you have been warned . 
  stay right unless you are prepared to play with the big boys . '', 
  what war ? 
  i 'm in baden-w\u00fcrttemberg , looking outside , no war , only sunshine . 
  sunshine and a lack of hochdeutsch . 
  ive been nearly killed by a belgian driver who was so busy talking she forgot to look in her mirrors . 
  this is n't belgium you silly person !, 
  we are going way too fast for that rubbish !, 
  apart from the old ones built by the nazis , most are 3 lane now , its irritating as fuck when they should be in the middle lane at the most . 
  yellow danger !, 
  remember we * build * those hunks of metal and rubber ... 
  its the people going at 140km/h in the left lane like they are the king of speed . 
  i might be coming up behind you doing up to ** 240 ** km/h . 
  at least your caravans know their place on the right . 
  * glares at holland *, 
  is it normal to ask where the bathroom is by `` do you have a bathroom ? '', 
  in the states ? 
  a friend asked me this and i could n't help but respond `` no , we shit on the floor . 
  yes of course we do . 
  down the hall , 3rd on the left '', 
  genuinely had an american tourist ask `` so , where is hitler buried ? '', 
  - whilst by the tomb of one of the kaisers . 
  i said `` nobody knows , nobody wants to know '' and refused to clarify . 
  argh some people . 
  yep , its something you can get fined for . 
  if i 'm looking before crossing the street when its empty , its for police . 
   do make room for faster cars on the left lane . 
  looking at you , netherlands , denmark , france , switzerland ... 
  nah , you took it from us for a few weeks , but it has returned to it 's rightful place , making my house feel like a furnace . 
  great , more cheap , awesome fruit for us !, 
  do n't worry poland , eu 's got this . 
  hated by the daily mail . 
  apples from poland , fermented in the uk , sold in germany . 
  i havent had a good cider in years thanks to the * bierkultur * here . 
  send them over !, 
  thanks putin !, 
  i 'm so sorry , i thought you were one of the types who think we should all split up again . 
  just noticed your username . 
  i 'm a dumbass sometimes . 
  i 've just realised how much of his accent is a strange combination of german and londoner ... 
  its based on the stereotype that we only talk when necessary , beyond that we much prefer to be working . 
  [ oh god . 
  ] ( http://www.toxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/teatanic02.jpg ) i kindof want one now ... 
  i 'm a centre-left eu-phile yes , but i can respect the telegraph , even if it is eu-sceptic however . 
  they actually bother to do things like researching facts , and proofreading their articles , rather than going for all-out scaremongering . 
  makes for much better debates and they are much more credible . 
  interestingly , has the daily mail yet discovered that being in the eu causes cancer ? 
  but those things do n't involve crossing a border in some way . 
  international postage , calls , bank transfers and whatever do . 
  what happens inside a country is down to that country , but when its international and you 're holding it back from being cheaper and easier , that 's when its not taking advantage . 
  ediit : besides , our two countries are on the same level of wealth roughly , so your logic really doesnt explain why international things should be so much more expensive from the uk . 
  i think you 're really overthinking this beyond : `` transactions involving other countries do n't have to be expensive within the eu ; why does the uk make it so ? 
  people would probably like the eu more if they could interact with it as cheaply as they can in other countries '' i could provide more examples of how transaction costs are grossly inflated by your companies , but you seem pretty set in your mentality so why waste the effort . 
  each to their own . 
  i find it amazing how some things are much more expensive in the uk , regarding foreign countries , than say , here in germany . 
  for example : a friend posted me some of my things that i had forgotten in england . 
  cost : # 17.50 i sent roughly the same weight of various things to him in england from here . 
  cost : $ 2.10 another : i sent money from my uk account to my german : cost # 10 for slow transfer , or # 30 for fast . 
  from my german account to my uk account ? 
  free to all eu nations . 
  i ca n't help but think ukip would be less popular if your country actually took advantage of the eu , rather than letting the daily mail and the express , backed by businesses who want to keep it this way , froth at the mouth . 
  that building is normande and they know it !, 
  they 're trying to bring those back in some regions though . 
  here everyone just speaks their regional dialect . 
  i know some people its easier to talk to in english because i ca n't understand their `` german '', 
  french regionalism ( do n't know the word ? ), 
  is even stronger than nationalism . 
  source : lived in normandy , and do n't you dare ever confuse it with brittany . 
  true , a friend who lives in oxford said he had to go there for a training course . 
  `` nightmare in concrete '' or something to those words . 
  it 's like the daily mail comments section has spilled into other websites , is n't it ?
