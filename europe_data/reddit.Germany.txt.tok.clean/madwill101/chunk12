  can confirm . 
  went to poland once . 
  white people everywhere . 
  ca n't possibly understand why they would n't like such an upstanding , tolerant individual like this guy clearly is . 
  yep , that 's angie . 
  to be fair , i think people should have to pay into a system before getting anything out , and it should n't be the responsibility of states like the uk or germany to pay for other country 's benefit claimants . 
  i noticed with your taxi drivers in particular , there is an extreme hatred for the polish and czechs . 
  that said , we get that here towards the turkish . 
  every country has at least one other country that taxi drivers hate . 
  [ perfect paris ] ( http://rt.com/files/news/1e/ec/60/00/31.jpg ) [ beautiful berlin ] ( http://cdn1.spiegel.de/images/image-396318-panov9-bzmf.jpg ) every country has right-wing assholes , sadly . 
  so long as they are not in power , follow your dreams . 
  that 's what we played in place of the actual american anthem when celebrating 4th july with our american coworkers . 
  it surprises me that there are countries here who are more eurosceptic than the uk ... 
  we will take them from the south east , you take them from the north , get the welsh involved to take them from the west , and we can have it all under ~ ~ german ~ ~ european control before their american friends arrive . 
  agreed . 
  i can barely understand the switzerd\u00fctsch , i ca n't imagine being part of the same country as them . 
  that said , nobody can understand us , either . 
  who is the 51 ^ st state of america if uk is 52 ^ nd ? 
  i 'm assuming israel ? 
  i agree with you in that i want the uk to stay in the eu , but they need to learn to say `` no '' to the united states . 
  unless you 're in britain . 
  i love it , i just keep quiet about it because you know , german . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ plus ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ planning ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ steal ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ all ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ jobs ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ muahahahaha, 
  well its hard to narrow it down . 
  ** uk ** the nightlife , the people , the humour , i can speak the language - could do with making your alcohol cheaper though ** france ** - the laid back lifestyle , the weather , the beaches of the south ** switzerland ** skiing , the mountains , the peacefulness of it all, 
  our rockets were really good at digging holes in those beaches in the early 40 's , 
  wonderful , think you can have one of those delicious fried breakfasts ready as well ? 
  i will be over with ~ ~ an invading party ~ ~ some beer next week . 
  good for them !, 
  russia is such a wonderful country with really amazing people , its just the minority that really ruin it , and sadly those minority are often in government . 
  hope to hear more good news like this from russia in the future . 
  yep , you can only get it down here i think . 
  i love it . 
  we have a pub nearby that sells only swabian food . 
  i could get rather fat there . 
  good choices !, 
  do n't forget * schweinshaxe * or the hundreds of types of * wurst * though . 
  and because i 'm swabian , * sp\u00e4tzle * and * maultaschen * ... 
  i 'm often amazed that i 'm not fat . 
  have you never tried a full english breakfast ? 
   i want the uk to leave the eu and i am not xenophobic . 
  [ nigel farage however , is . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27459923 ) [ as are quite a few others in ukip ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukips-top-10-most-memorable-quotes-nigel-farage-godfrey-bloom-david-silvester-more-1433098 ) not the sort of people i would want representing me . 
  indeed . 
  maybe if they left we could actually get something done around here !, 
  yep , that 's what i 'm referring to . 
  a v2 rocket aimed at antwerp misfired and hit mortsel . 
  ah fair enough . 
  on ours it isnt even mentioned , for obvious reasons . 
  while not everyone believed in the nazi ideology , enough did that we ca n't really add it . 
  nice part of the uk you live in by the way . 
  i had a few interesting nights in eastbourne in the past :d, 
  agreed . 
  i can understand the british ( i say british as it was churchill who ordered it ) mentality behind destroying such a beautiful city , but by that point the war was over for germany . 
  people had lost the will to fight and just wanted to go home to their families . 
  i ca n't imagine being told that your family have been burned to a crisp by the raf would do much good ; in fact i could see it going worse as many would think they had nothing to lose . 
  the japanese however would never have surrendered without something as vastly powerful as the atom bomb being used against them . 
  the emperor was a god to them and he was not interested in coming second . 
  i think that thing is the worst thing the human race has ever created , but damnit i am glad it was the usa who got there first and not the ussr , or indeed germany . 
  i wo n't pretend my country was not run by a megalomaniac who would have willingly used it on civilians , and i think if russia had gotten hold of it first then germany would be a footnote in history , and a radioactive wasteland . 
  to be fair , bombs back then were not particularly accurate . 
  that was a mistake and i 'm sure those responsible would admit that once the fighting was over . 
  edit : it also appears that one of dr braun 's creations also misfired and hit the town . 
  we had patriotism quite literally beaten out of us in the last half of the last century ; berlin has spent more time divided than together for many people alive today . 
  it will take a long time before a german can feel proud of his country without someone making a nazi reference . 
  i 'm glad to see that this is finally disappearing from people from other countries when talking to us . 
  it has taken time but progress is finally being made . 
  i 'm glad patriotism is no longer equal to nationalism ; i have no desire to hate other nations . 
  speaking of brits ; i have a craving for some english tea now !, 
  nice , in most towns in germany , it is a statue of a bust of an imerpial soldier , with 1914-1918 written under it , and maybe the names of the poor souls who gave their lives for this country . 
  there are , understandably , no memorials to the wwii dead , aside from the [ kaiser wilhelm memorial church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaiser_wilhelm_memorial_church ) in berlin , which commemorates the deaths of all those in wwii , not just germans . 
  that 's true . 
  we basically have no sense of national pride whatsoever . 
  we collectively hate ourselves out of fear of looking like nazis otherwise . 
  the only exception to this is when the football is on . 
  everywhere was covered in the black , red and gold . 
  beautiful to witness . 
  was proud to be german that night . 
  true , we lost * everything * , including some of our nicer cities and regions ( breslau and k\u00f6nigsberg for example ) , while it speeded up the end of the british empire by decades . 
  germany very much just wants everybody to be friends and together now ; one of the reasons we are pushing for the eu . 
  i know you and i have pretty opposite views on where the eu should be going , but as you say , i expect that 's the consequence of growing up on opposite sides . 
  personally , i hope you stay in the eu , but as you say , different views from different environments . 
  so long as we can maintain our alliances , europe will be a better place overall . 
  i do n't think we will ever be able to fully explain the awful actions committed by our two nations in that time . 
  war brings out the very worst in people , regardless of nationality . 
  this gets proven every time we are so shocked to see photos of people acting like decent human beings to those of the opposite side . 
  i 'm just glad that we are on the same side now . 
  i would say for the most part britain has been a good influence on the world . 
  sure there were some bad bits , but you introduced the western system of democracy to the world and played your part in bringing about the near-complete downfall of absolute monarchies . 
  i just think every country should learn what it has done to make the world a worse place , as well , to ensure that people do n't copy those behaviours . 
  the friends i have from your country had not heard of it . 
  it seems they are probably the type to have slept through that class . 
  sepp blatter is happening . 
  fine , bring it here . 
  we still have all the stadiums from 2006 . 
  then you can take your best shot infront of us . 
  yep , remember reading that churchill tried to brush over the fact that he was the one who effectively signed the order . 
  i 'm glad these cities can come together and try to heal each others wounds . 
  what happened in both were atrocities and those who signed off the orders should hang their heads in shame . 
  it really worries me that there are people out there , under the banner of patriotism , that can justify the firebombing of a cultural centre , full of civilians .
