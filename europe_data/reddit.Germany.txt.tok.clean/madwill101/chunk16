  in the extreme case that the person does n't speak english , just say `` kann ich ? '', 
  and point at what you want to do , and `` wo ist '' and point at the place you want to go on a map or whatever . 
  better yet , say `` ok '' and try someone else . 
  honestly people wont care that you dont speak german . 
  on a positive note , try the d\u00f6ner kebab , you 've never tried anything like it . 
  same as wherever you 're from i suspect . 
  people go out , they get to know eachother , they have sex , they keep going out , they move in together eventually , they marry , they have children , they get old . 
  people tend to stay together from what i know . 
  relationships often last a long time . 
  plus around here the trains are often full . 
  the steps inside the train are fine to sit on , but please sit on the left-hand side ( in the direction the train is going ) doors . 
  most platforms are on the right , if you do n't want to piss everyone off . 
  tea . 
  a british friend introduced me to the concept of drinking black tea with milk . 
  it 's just not done in our countries . 
  tea is also expensive elsewhere . 
  twinings english breakfast is about 4 $ for a small pack where i 'm from . 
  do n't bother with chocolate since you 're near switzerland , and milka is nicer than cadbury since kraft made it taste more like plastic . 
  also , you do know mezzo mix is coca cola and fanta together right ? 
  you could always make it at home !, 
  schwip schwap is pepsi and fanta . 
   nice sliced bread wait , is n't that just sandwich bread ? 
  same here ... 
  22 / male - if you want to hook up with a foreigner , use tinder . 
  my best friend is gay and gets his hookups with grindr . 
  same as any country really . 
  through friends . 
  i 'm sure there is a big difference between somewhere like hamburg and somewhere like oberschmeien ( i 'm on a train , we just went past this place . 
  something tells me dating options are quite low here . ), 
  but it is what it is . 
  for your munich-paris journey , check out [ busliniensuche.de ] ( http://www.busliniensuche.de/ ) which shows the best bus , train or carpool availible , or just go direct to [ deutsche bahn ] ( http://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml ) , for paris-amsterdam try [ megabus ] ( https://www.megabus.com/ ) ( remember to use the eu site ) , [ thalys ] ( https://www.thalys.com/ ) or of course [ eurolines ] ( http://www.eurolines.com/en/ ) . 
  safe journey !, 
  have a great time in europe !, 
  take it from a german ; you do not know the meaning of the word `` expensive '' until you visit london . 
  personally i would visit some of the smaller cities in the uk if you want to get a real feel for the country and not blow your whole budget . 
  i recommend cardiff or southampton if you like to party , and york , or bath as op said if you want to see true english culture . 
  yorkshire and the lake district are beautiful too . 
  also , youre in europe for 2 months , while that seems like a long time , youre really overdoing it with what you think can be achieved in that time if you want to enjoy the places . 
  pick a few main places and chill with it . 
  you will have a much better time doing that than seeing the autobahns every day . 
  if you 're after clubs . 
  hit up budapest , berlin or prague for a night . 
  couchsurf , airbnb , and hostelworld are your friends . 
  you could gladly stay here but i live in the ass end of nowhere , its hard to reach and i would n't wish the place on a tourist anyway . 
  if you come to germany be sure to check out the south as well as berlin !, 
  seriously consider a maestro card in germany . 
  i do n't know about bayern but here in schwaben visa is almost unheard of in many stores . 
  that or at least carry a little cash , maybe 100 $ in case it takes a while to find another atm , with you at all times . 
  theres a few cash machines around the marienplatz that take international cards if i remember rightly . 
  same here . 
  i got arrested in switzerland , as soon as they realised it wasnt me that they were looking for ( about 2 hours later ) i was simply released with a profuse apology , and then walked to where i could get some food to recoup mentally . 
  ive dealt with police in the uk , germany and switzerland and have never had issues . 
  in all 3 countries they have been respectful , helpful and whilst very much alert of the situation and whatever , are not immune to a casual joke or two if there is nothing too serious to be worrying about . 
  overall i am glad for the police being there in these countries . 
  they keep order , make everything safer , and are always willing to help . 
  german police have been the most friendly in my view . 
  they saw me after having had one too many to drink , sitting in the entrance of a shop . 
  they asked if i was okay . 
  i responded that i was and was merely getting my energy back before going to my train . 
  the officer pointed the direction of the train station and told me to stay safe regarding any valuables , then drove on his way . 
  most hostels will have somewhere you can lock your stuff away . 
  but the crime rate is overall lower than in the us . 
  poprock , classics , electro , german music ( mostly rap or `` schlager '' ) or a mixture . 
  personally i listen to bayern 3 ( poprock / top40 ) or nrg ( electro , house ) back when i lived in france it was fun radio or rtl 2, 
  i think the uk are more favorable on commonwealth nations , worth looking into . 
  germany is great for chemical engineers . 
  bayer , basf , etc are all here , plus more and more often we all speak english in the workplace . 
  i 'm wholeheartedly glad that the eu exists . 
  its nice to not have us trying to rip ourselves apart in petty arguments with our neighbours . 
  i do n't get what the uk has against the idea of becoming better allies . 
  i guess its just that mr farage is by far the loudest anti-eu individual , with marine le pen in a close second , so it does generally appear to the rest of us that the uk is against the eu . 
  dont forget easyjet , germanwings , wizz air or air berlin, 
  trains , [ ryanair ] ( http://www.ryanair.com/ ) , [ easyjet ] ( http://www.easyjet.com/en/ ) , [ germanwings ] ( https://www.germanwings.com/en/index.shtml ) , [ air berlin ] ( http://www.airberlin.com/de-de/site/start.php ) , [ wizz air ] ( http://wizzair.com/de-de/search ) . 
  for shorter distances look at buses such as [ eurolines ] ( http://www.eurolines.com/en/ ) , [ megabus ] ( https://www.megabus.com/ ) if the price of trains is too high . 
  there internal long distance buses too , like for germany its via [ buslinensuche ] ( http://www.busliniensuche.de/ ) - couldnt tell you for other countries . 
  there are also carpooling with [ blablacar ] ( http://www.blablacar.com/ ) . 
  i wish we were n't so strict on everything . 
  so many rules for everything . 
  also we are so far behind on some forms of technology - why the hell do i still have to write bank transfers rather than just doing everything online . 
  i use ebay , personally . 
  people in europe are for the most part pretty lax . 
  i have done this in switzerland and italy and france where i never had any issues . 
  besides , most sense of modesty will be gone after a short period in hostels . 
  the visas are for 90 days only according to people from the usa whom i 've met . 
  the only way to extend it and stay in europe longer is to spend 90 more days after in the uk , which will hurt the wallet as the uk is expensive , you need another visa , and you wouldnt be able to work there either . 
  aside from that try [ eurail ] ( http://www.eurail.com/?gclid=coat0p-ukr8cfwkwtaoddh4a4a ) , the public transport is pretty good in most countries , there are night trains , etc. 
  stay in hostels as its cheap and you will meet people from everywhere . 
  be aware that switzerland is not in the eu ( but a schengen visa will cover you ) and does n't use the euro . 
  its very expensive there but still worth a visit . 
  only the uk and ireland are not , i think . 
  never really headed east though so do n't quote me on that . 
  the visa would be a tourist one . 
  it would grant you access to the schengen zone ( most of europe apart from the uk and ireland i think ) for 90 days . 
  you could n't get work legally here though so you need to bring money . 
  as for finding people , youre best to bring someone from the states with you . 
  you might get lucky in a hostel but i doubt it . 
  personally i would go visit the south west . 
  bordeaux , biarritz etc. 
  if you have more money to spend , head to the south east ; nice , marseille , and the principality of monaco might be up your street . 
  agreed .
