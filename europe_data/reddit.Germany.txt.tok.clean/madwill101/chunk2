  nothing happens there . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ god , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ true . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ remind ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me . 
  never saw it in edeka in my town . 
  kaufland is stupidly far out of my town to be bothered going to . 
  best brand ever . 
  i just wish we had a rewe closer to where i live . 
  [ le gruy\u00e8re ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gruy%c3%a8re_cheese ) , no doubt . 
  with their alcohol prices , some of them probably have never seen it before . 
  it 's obscenely expensive . 
  i know not all british are like this , but the stereotypical images we get : the ones that go to live there : form enclaves where they refuse to integrate with the local populace , do n't bother with the language , shun the local culture , read the daily mail , eat only english food and complain about foreigners ruining the uk and how they hope ukip win . 
  to go on vacation : get horribly drunk , start a fight with the local people , throw up on a war memorial / hotel lobby / taxicab / the middle of the street , repeat . 
  i 've been told this also happens in other countries by friends from prague , riga , budapest , munich and amsterdam . 
  uk politics has pretty much thrown the country into a bad light around here , but this action is highly commendable , and having watched that ship depart , i think its high time every country start contributing fairly and evenly . 
  the other problem is its easier to indoctrinate your kids and leave them without basic skills in the process . 
  if i want my kids to be religious fundamentalists , holocaust deniers , etc. 
  its much easier to do without the school system getting in the way . 
  germany has had more than its fair share of bullshit in the past , lets not make it easier for it to continue . 
  interesting . 
  i keep meaning to read up on her , considering how some people have undying devotion to her , whilst others got `` ding dong the witch is dead '' into the charts upon her death . 
  she sounds like a fascinating , very controversial figure . 
  aha , its obvious is n't it ^ ^, 
  if you 're from the same region as me ; the town . 
  if you 're from germany ; my town , in my region . 
  but i use the traditional regional name and not the bundesland due to lokalpatriotismus . 
  anyone else . 
  `` germany . 
  from a place near xxxx , kinda '', 
  i can hear farage screaming about this already ... to be honest , in this case , i could n't blame him . 
  bad idea to punish the countries that kept everything in a reasonable order . 
  yes nigel , we are all aware of your opinions , but we were asking if you want to go to lunch ? 
  i think thats the issue with an island nation . 
  much easier to culturally isolate yourself from everything happening around you . 
  i love the younger generation , they are great and we have a lot in common . 
  they can take the piss and its all good . 
  many seem to have joined the erasmus program and a lot of them love the eu as a result , ( perhaps to do with how much you drink on erasmus , for a much lower price than in the uk , or how much you get laid ; maybe both ) the older generation , particularly baby boomers and older . 
  they love farage . 
  they think germany is just waiting to go to war with them again . 
  i heard one yesterday saying the * daily mail * had reported that barusso wanted a one-child-policy in the uk to his equally elderly and middle class friend , who was of course outraged . 
  the older people and the right wing media are the problems here . 
  the rest are great . 
  true . 
  i forgot about the potential for subcontracting parts to local suppliers . 
  i hope that is whats going on anyway . 
  you just perfectly described a bavarian . 
  personally , i like the gays and emos better than the tanks . 
  i think its a bit rich to be calling us authoritarian warmongers and drug addicts as well . 
  yep . 
  am swabian , am from a catholic family , do not want church and government working together . 
  think they do work together too much already ( see : church tithe ), 
  the daily mail and what not appeal to racist old people and those who think the 1950s were the greatest . 
  the younger british seem alright . 
  the country is getting better . 
  i say `` euro '' as singular and plural . 
  edit : i would only say `` euros '' to mean several euro coins . 
  but it enabled you to import more cheaply . 
  there are other markets you export to which probably helped cover up that issue with europe . 
   `` before we joined renault we were making 110,000 cars a year here with 30,000 workers , today it 's 340,000 cars , with 14,000 workers . '', 
  i 'm gon na call this a mixed blessing . 
  sure production is up , but how much is that benefiting the local people ? 
  just out of question , i 'm guessing mass immigration in the 1950s was to help with the rebuilding efforts and the subsequent `` economic miracle '' , much like we underwent ? 
  i 'm just interested in why it happened then , and i 'm guessing this would be it . 
  the uk has benefitted rather well from the ez-crisis . 
  it put the value of the # up nicely against the $ , enabling you to do better out of trade , and then there was the surplus labour that other users have pointed out . 
  considering the sorry state the # was looking in when brown was pm , i would say the uk did rather nicely out of the beginning of the euro 's downfall . 
  personally i wish we could abandon the euro as a failed experiment and go back to the dm to protect ourselves from the failings in other countries . 
  i 'm pro eu but that just has to go until we have some stability , which wo n't happen as people will see it as the rise of the 4th reich we will get [ this sort of welcome again ] ( http://nationalpostnews.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/greece-3.jpg ) . 
  meh , the city is gone . 
  it will never be the same as it was , and it will never be german again . 
  the new russia is even doing a good job at restoring her to her former glory , compared to the soviets ( damn karl marx and his hatred of anything prussian ) back to what was once a beautiful city . 
  nowadays the bigger thing is that the city is now a massive base of operations for the russian military . 
  i would feel much more comfortable if it were a free city or something , not somewhere that could not be used for military purposes . 
  that 's all . 
  an eye for an eye will leave everyone blind . 
  the sacking of k\u00f6nigsberg was the event that harmed my family personally , so do n't expect me to smile and say `` good '' . 
  people are perfectly entitled to feel anger at the destruction done by the hand of germany also ( believe me , we also feel hatred toward nazis , kaiser wilhelm ii , etc ) , but that is the event that was particularly bed for my family . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  i was writing this whilst multitasking . 
  i knew there were other places but could n't think of the exact ones . 
  netherlands is also pretty good , as is belgium in places , and more . 
   would n't be moving inside the eu for that . 
  germany . 
  sweden . 
  there are places other than the uk with a good job situation . 
   not if you want a job . 
  there is plenty available in resorts . 
  i did italy last year . 
  almost certainly doing it next year also . 
   there is no better lifestyle than eating fish and chips on a wet and windy friday night . 
  each to their own . 
  you have your fish and chips and wind and rain . 
  i will stick with my wine or beer on a warm sunny summer evening , or my j\u00e4gertee or gl\u00fchwein in the snowy winter after skiing . 
  ca n't wait to see what those british who * do * want to get out think of that . 
  `` nope , sorry mr smith , but we have an agreement with nige . 
  we wo n't send over any plumbers , and you can never settle here in return . '', 
  what about moving to a country with a better job situation , or better weather , or a better lifestyle ? 
  a bavarian , no less . 
  fact is , a lot of british would be absolutely outraged if eu governments treated them with the same contempt that they want to treat us with . 
  if you come over here , great , no problem . 
  we are n't going to make benefits readily available but if you can find a job here , you 're welcome to stay .
