  thanks obama . 
  see that ? 
  that 's how stupid you sound . 
  well . . 
  he is 18 years old . 
  and i believe that solely from his world view , and his missteps ( of twitting women should never walk alone ), 
  every german should donate to refugees !, 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.de/aras-bacho/deutsche-fluechtlinge-geld-spenden_b_13121696.html which is ridiculous . . 
  i 'm already paid my taxes into your living allowance you ungrateful shit . 
  i will put up some anecdotes : the [ toyota recall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%e2%80%9311_toyota_vehicle_recalls ) . 
  what if i tell you , from the perspective of toyota , that i would rather go to the lawsuits and pay whatever fines that might impose to me rather than recalling all the cars to replace the breaks when not all * the breaks were faulty . 
  because , after all , it makes more economical sense ( it was , indeed , the case ) . 
  in other words , the cost of damage and deaths that happened and might happen from the small percentage of car is a ** number that i can accept ** as replacing all the models ( remember most of the cars were functional ) will truly cost a lot more . 
  and what will you say then ? 
  because if you say this is immoral , we are customers , there are laws , social principles and values etc. . then would n't you think accepting the number of death from rising terrorist events because it is still negligible in a bigger scale of cause of deaths , is just as immoral as the fictitious toyota ceo ? 
  i get it you wish to ensure the sense of security by telling people it is safe . 
  that i can not deny , it is still relatively safe compare to many countries . 
  but comparing your crime stats against other low-hanging fruits does injustice to your own improvement . 
  it is as if saying you have been 100 % before and now that you have 70 % , it is still fine because other people are still at 50 % . 
  we compare our old selves to our own betterment , not so much with others . 
  sure there are right-wings who see this as opportunistic events to spread fear . 
  but doing the exact opposite of that , telling people that it is still 100 % wonderful without actually looking through a microscope on that matter , is doing your nation a disservice . 
  and if because of this you ( or you as a group ) decides to do nothing other than preaching `` the world is as safe as yesterday '' , then i think you owe the future deceases caused by similar terrorism an apology . 
  what you are looking at is probability . 
  low probability does not mean that it is good . 
  we always look at the growth of things . 
  this is the main reason why economists are so concern themselves with growth of gdp , growth of wealth , and growth of other parameters . 
  if you have 10 accidents per km driven per annum for the past 10 years ( constant rate of change ) and suddenly you see a 15 accidents per km driven per annum , and 20 accidents per km driven per annum . 
  then we have an upward trending growth of road accidents , this means the policy maker should totally look at what did they do wrong and make appropriate amends . 
  now , if you see the year from 2011 to 2014 , there was no single terrorism attempts ( or any islamic terrorism ) in germany . 
  suddenly in 2015 , there was this [ attempt by one berlin islamist ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/islamist-shot-dead-in-berlin-after-knife-attack-on-policewoman/a-18721009 ) . 
  this cause , a [ singularity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singularity_\\ ( mathematics \\ ) ) in calculation , which we normally will ignore . 
  turn to 2016 , i do n't need to tell you how many terrorist attempts are there do i ? 
  i 'm sure you and i have been alerted all this time . 
  normally , growth like this rings alarm bells . 
  in economist , the nation will in the state of `` bust '' if deflation happens in 2 quarter , and the economic agents have to act quick . 
  my point is . 
  terrorism is growing again in europe . 
  this time in the form of islamic terrorism . 
  a religious ideologies that do not ask for secession ( munich olympic ) , not for release of certain prisoners , no because of class struggle ( raf ) ... 
  these `` new '' type of terrorist aim only at the the innocence , anyone considered western , anyone walking in the streets after an event , taking the trams , going shopping , enjoying gl\u00fchwein . 
  and if all you want to do say is : it 's fine , it 's a very slim probability anyway . 
  on top of that , they are more people dying on the roads than by islamic terrorist . 
  ** it is the number of death that i can accept ** . 
  and proceed to heal only the superficial wounds thinking that you have it all in control . 
  then forget all about it after erecting some monuments . 
  if that is all you have to say , then i feel terribly sorry for your ( or our ) citizens because of your insensitivity ( and inaction , as a group ) . 
   and you do n't think that is exactly what these terror groups want ? 
  and they also want you to keep that gate open so they can slip some rats in . 
  who cares if you able to catch a bunch of rats , it takes only one rat to cause event such as this . 
  basically checkmate . 
   i am not downplaying anything . 
  and  27 million visitors per annum . 
  so far , we have one death on a christmas market . 
  i would still call that `` extremely safe '' these statements do n't fit each other . 
  you want to compare how many died last year due in weichnachtsmarkt to this year ? 
  are these lives just a number to you ? 
  trying to salvage the sanity in this world of ridiculous chaos is heroic . 
  hoping the world to be better by downplaying a serious problem is irresponsible . 
  if you keep ignoring the syndromes , one day it will be incurable . 
  i admired your misplaced sense of security . . but  police now say they suspect it was a deliberate attack http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38373867, 
  does it not concern you that even a 12 years-old german muslim can be inspired to kill your country innocence because of his religious beliefs ? 
  or this is just a `` distance '' phenomena you grown too insensitive to ? 
   asylum claim is rejected not equal to deportation . 
  a lot are `` tolerated '' or `` disappeared '', 
  and then electricity on air conditioning in the summer . 
  have you been to a typical house in portugal or spain ? 
  did n't really think that through did you ? 
  it is not . . 
  though i 'm not vegetarian . 
  the meat industry , from farms to processing , is the one of the main contributing factor to carbon and methane emissions, 
  if a country ca n't even keep safe in certain areas of their own land , how did the nuclear commission allowed for nuclear programmes to be set up in said country . 
  and they wo n't go to the safe area in their county who speaks the same language , and more culturally close to themselves ? 
  seems to be they are just economic migrants . 
  why are there so many afgans , iranian ( who has their own nuclear programme btw ) , pakistan ( also has nuclear programme ) and iraqis ? 
  also , did n't germany declared afganistan to be a safe country ? 
  how many countries did these asylum seekers stepped over just to have a wonderful lives i wonder, 
  some is more bias than the other . 
  not everything in this world is binary . 
  thought you would have learnt that from brexit 's kerfuffle . 
   woo us back please . 
  your prime minister has sold the country to china . 
  the only country britain needs talking with is china , deals with malaysia and philippines would be a bonus freebies . 
  300 plus freehousing . 
  and normal hartz iv went asylum is approved . 
  first of all , having opinions against uncontrolled immigration is not extreme right . 
  it can be centrist or realist . 
  but i see what you 're doing here . 
  you are trying to make leftist looks bad . 
  and then this would push people to be more right because everyone tend to oppose assholes . 
  that 's your agenda is n't it ... south park was right !, 
  people like you do exists !, 
  you think they would want to go to poland ? 
  because they needed verification that the news is really true rather than jumping the gun ? 
  this is germany , our mainstream medias do their due diligence . 
  if you do n't like slow news . . go read brebait or some dm shit, 
   die out at the walls of fortress europe i do n't think they were dying in jordan , turkey and northern africa . 
   17-year-old unaccompanied refugee i doubt that very much . 
  utter retard that do n't go know that the essentials ( eigenwerte ) of any statements made and hastily got offended for nothing . 
  see how i 'm pointing just at you and not others ?
