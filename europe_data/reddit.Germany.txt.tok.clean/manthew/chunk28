  she wants what the economist call : the ` blank cheque ' . 
  no , there 's no jus soli in europe . 
  the attackers have a parent who hold an european citizen , who themselves ( the parent ) may have acquired in the oast, 
  they were not attending ramadan related concert , were they ? 
  do n't use the decease to excuse the violent minority . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice thing . 
  maybe we should all start celebrating ramadan , since it 's least likely to be bombed . 
  global warming ?!, 
  this is literally freezing !, 
  the opposite of warming !, 
  fake news !!!!!, 
  kick the mexicans out !, 
  i think the white house needs him more than you do . 
  do n't act as if visa-reciprocity does n't exist between nations . 
   will the eu also block japanese people from getting lets say swedish citzenship , because an ** eu citizen in japan ca n't get japanese citizenship ** also what rubbish are you eating . 
  eu citizens , as with all other migrants in japanese , can get japanese citizenship when such migrant has fulfilled all the conditions as set up by japanese government ; just as japanese in migrants in sweden can get swedish citizenship when they fulfilled the requirements . 
  only difference is that japanese government focus more on just `` speaking the language '' as a requirement . 
  go to bed , you clearly need to wake up and get to retard school on time tomorrow . 
   so why does germany support fascist turkey then ? 
  uhmm . . what ? 
  is the word `` fascist '' some term you throw around to make a dumb exhibition of yourself ? 
  bwahahas so you 're one of those things that exist on earth that have no purpose or reasons . 
  sometimes , to relief my impostor syndrome , i would just say to myself `` oh , at least retards like you exist somewhere out there in the world '' . 
   let them continue because they are kurdish . 
  did you even read the article ? 
  i even posted it in the thread so you do n't have to click it . 
  it 's the turkish government that released them and it is the german authorities that want to re-arrest them after court overturned their acquittals . 
  the only thing you focus on is that they are kurdish apparently . 
  this is why i 'm against dual citizenship . 
  if the turks/kurds want to take german passports and to enjoy all its benefits , then they should renounce their roots to another country ( especially to a country that is increasingly antagonistic to germany ) and bear the goods and bads of germany equally like every other germans . 
  the deleted post below was complaining why is n't this a local crime before it was bombed . 
  and i did n't want to waste what i had typed out in exchange for sweet upvotes p :, 
  ** a turkish court has set free two german-turks after finding them not guilty of killing their sister in berlin in 2005 . 
  the case caused public outrage in germany over the treatment of women in some muslim families . 
  ** judges in istanbul ruled that there `` was n't enough explicit and plausible clear evidence '' to find the unnamed 36 and 38-year-olds guilty of complicity in the murder . 
  their younger brother has already served time in a juvenile facility for the crime in germany . 
  hatun s\u00fcr\u00fcc\u00fc , 23 , a german of kurdish background , was shot dead on february 7 , 2005 by her youngest brother , ayhan - 19 at the time - while she was standing at a bus stop near her apartment in the berlin district of tempelhof . 
  she left a 5-year-old son , born of a forced marriage to her cousin when she was 16 . 
  she later divorced her husband . 
  ayhan was sentenced to nine years and three months in juvenile detention in germany . 
  ** he told the court that he had killed his sister because he despised her `` western '' lifestyle and wanted to restore his family 's honor ** . 
  hatun , who had reported threats of violence to police , was training to be an electrician at the time she was killed , and was reportedly dating a german man . 
  long wait for a retrial the two older brothers , who were already co-defendants at the trial in germany , were acquitted due to a lack of evidence . 
  however , in august 2007 , the german federal court of justice overturned their acquittals and intended to resume proceedings against them . 
  by that time , however , the ** two brothers had moved to turkey ** , where authorities eventually also initiated criminal proceedings . 
  german authorities supplied their turkish counterparts with a wealth of material and evidence . 
  their trial for murder commenced in istanbul on january 26 , 2016 . 
  ayhan , who had been deported to turkey in 2014 , insisted at the trial that he alone was responsible , although this time he did not attempt to justify it with the motive of `` honor . '', 
  instead , he claimed to have lost his self-control . 
  state prosecutors had called for long prison sentences for the two brothers , now 36 and 38 , for complicity in murder . 
  the murder , which came after six other so-called `` honor killings '' in berlin since october 2004 , aroused a heated public debate in germany about the treatment of women in muslim culture . 
  opponents of turkey 's admission to the european union used it as an example of that country 's alleged disregard for human rights . 
  demonstrations still take place on the anniversary of hatun 's death , with participants campaigning to promote assistance for girls who are faced with forced marriage or violence from their families . 
   no , he does not . 
  nor does his voting base . 
  so they complement each other . 
   risk of drowning and they can be deported here 's the thing . 
  the risk is low and the deportation procedures in europe in abysmally inadequate . 
  or they can go to scandinavia and stab someone once they knew they have been deported to stay in nice prison for a longer time . 
  let 's say i 'm one of the migrants . 
  i knew you would have to save me even when i 'm in libyan water and you would ferry my to europe . 
  so let me light my boat on fire on purpose just to speed things up . 
  how many thousands more migrants you want to save `` from drowning '' ? 
  by the way , did you know there 's absolutely no one is drowning while attempting to cross the even harsher sea to reach australia now ? 
  do you know what australia did ? 
  thanks , doctors without borders . 
  i hope this fills up your ego . 
  i ( as an asian ) was robbed by a group of french speaking african few months ago . 
  so i 'm going to go ahead and assert that us asians , minority of a minority , is being robbed by all africans in europe ? 
  you ca n't attach one individual misdeed onto the group . 
  text : viktor orb\u00c1n , hungary 's prime minister , says the `` overwhelming majority '' of migrants in europe are not refugees but are merely seeking a better life . 
  robert fico , his slovak counterpart , says up to 95 % are economic migrants . 
  the distinction matters , for under the 1951 refugee convention and a string of eu laws , european countries must offer refuge or other types of protection to asylum-seekers who can demonstrate that they are fleeing war or persecution . 
  they are under no such obligation to those looking to improve their prospects , even if they have left behind lives of destitution . 
  so if messrs orb\u00e1n and fico are right , europe 's migration crisis amounts largely to a problem of border management and repatriation ; not relocation , integration and the rest of it . 
  are they ? 
  let 's look at the numbers . 
  according to the eu , in the first quarter of 2015 , there were seven countries whose nationals obtained a `` rate of recognition '' -- some form of protection in an eu country -- over 50 % ( see chart ) . 
  put crudely , citizens of these seven countries obtained protection in the eu over half the time they applied . 
  how many of these people are reaching europe ? 
  the unhcr says that syria , afghanistan and iraq account for nine in ten of the quarter-million-odd migrants detected arriving in greece this year . 
  citizens of eritrea , somalia and sudan comprise 41 % of the 119,500 arrivals in italy , and another 6 % come from syria . 
  in other words , citizens from countries that usually obtain protection in the eu account for fully 75 % of illicit arrivals by sea this year . 
  crunch the numbers further and we find that at least 81 % of those migrants entering greece can expect to receive refugee status or some other form of protection in the eu . 
  the figure for those entering italy , who are a far more diverse bunch , is 46 % . 
  many nigerians , bangladeshis and gambians , among others , fail to obtain protection after crossing the mediterranean ( see chart 2 ) . 
  another way to look at the data is as follows : under the european commission 's new proposal to relocate 160,000 asylum-seekers from italy , greece and hungary to most other eu countries , only nationals from countries with acceptance rates over 75 % will be eligible . 
  for now that means syrians , eritreans and iraqis . 
  this matters because it is only these people , once they are relocated , that will trouble the likes of mr fico . 
  mr orb\u00e1n has the misfortune to govern a country that many migrants traverse en route from greece to germany . 
  according to the unhcr 's figures , these three groups account for 62 % of total arrivals by sea this year . 
  we might also note that 227,169 syrians , eritreans and iraqis have already been detected at the eu 's borders so far this year . 
  the commission 's proposal aims to cover the next two years . 
  even if it is enacted , the plan will cover well under half of the total number of eligible nationals who reach europe in that period . 
  these numbers capture only those entering ( and detected ) by sea -- some european countries , germany in particular , have a separate problem of asylum-seekers travelling overland from balkan countries like kosovo , serbia and albania , the vast majority of whom are denied protection -- and cover only `` first-instance '' decisions . 
  still , the headline numbers suggest that the vast majority of illegal migrants reaching europe will be eligible for protection once they arrive . 
  in mr orban 's defence , it is true that the legal distinction between refugees and economic migrants often fails to capture the complex mixture of motives that drive migrants to make their epic journeys . 
  war may be the catalyst for a journey that refugees will then seek to make as economically beneficial as possible . 
  but in dealing with large numbers of migrants who , the data show , have fled countries stricken by war or the caprice of dictatorship , european politicians should strive for a more generous approach .
