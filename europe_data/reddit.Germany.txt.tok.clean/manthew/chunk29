  i 'm against mass immigration of muslims whom i have high doubts in integrating into the society . 
  and i believe the rise of homosexual attacks these days are linked to influx of muslim immigrants . 
  however , this is a local crime . 
  marktplatz is right in removing your post . 
  but instead of posting this into a more appropriate subs ( i.e. 
  / r/berlin , / r/de ) , you spew out trumpique equivalence of `` muuhh freedom of speech rights . 
  you elitist and the fat cats in brussels are destroying the earth ... '' from you post history , you are clearly pushing your own agenda of anti-muslims . 
  i deduce that you do not even care for homosexuals . 
  like trump , you see us as a chess-set for your lousy approach to complex matter . 
  i can excuse stupid because no everyone is born smart ; but i can not excuse stupid and ignorant . 
  `` oowhh ... you denied my post ( which is violating the subreddit rules anyway ) , you must be a kurdish terrorist . '', 
  that 's you ; that 's how dumb you sound . 
  go home . 
  the title is sensational and clickbaity . 
  what she meant is europe should no longer rely on uk and us for security . 
  which is a reasonable thing to be honest . 
  we need to have our own independent intelligence . 
  better source : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40078183 p.s. 
  redditors should stop posting dubious articles from dubious news sources . 
  because they are likely to be armchair reporters with a knack for sensational clickbait contents . 
  must be some angry italians , totally not muslims / s p.s. 
  sorry for the low effort circlejerk, 
  incompetence , blatantly incompetence . 
  and also  around 60 percent of asylum-seekers arrive in germany without id papers what the actual fuck ?!, 
  i knew throwing your papers is commonly practice amongst these asylum seekers . 
  but 60 % ?!, 
  this raise even more question on how many of them actually qualify for asylum , truly ? 
  all i can see if they are abusing the lax asylum system in germany . 
  then do n't bark at us for nato budget . 
  i rather we spend on an european army . 
  and france and italy right hosts refugees in their country . 
  how about uk and us ? 
  nato led to the overturn of qaddafi which sent libya into chaos . 
  and europe is paying from the fall out of refugees . 
  now is us contributing to ease the fall out ? 
  typical us , just love to destabilise a country and then leave after s. letting someone shit gets stirred so hard no one can fix it . 
  letting someone else to clean up the mess, 
   22 % of the world population are terrorists no but significant of them supports and sympathise with the terrorism group enough that they are still functioning . 
   islam 's ability to appear as a victim and at the same time islam is suppose to be the greatest religion . 
  it is a peaceful religion after all / s, 
  there is a confucian saying that goes : '' \u517b\u4e0d\u6559 \u7236\u4e4b\u8fc7 \u6559\u4e0d\u4e25 \u5e08\u4e4b\u60f0 '' loosely translate to  to feed without teaching , is the father 's fault . 
  to teach without severity , is the teacher 's laziness . 
  [ more here ] ( http://www.yellowbridge.com/onlinelit/sanzijing.php ), 
   this guy has commited an heinous crime , but thousand of others did n't . 
  or , thousands of others hate their hosting society so much so that the probability of someone actually acting on the heinous crime is high . 
  with parents , who are refugees themselves , did not teach their children well enough to grow up to be a decent human being . 
   stay safe i know you meant well . 
  but what does this even mean ? 
  did the victim not stayed safe enough themselves ? 
  to be honest , no matter how safe you have ` stayed ' , no matter how many times ` stay safe ' people utter to you , events like these always it unexpectedly at anywhere anytime . 
  in reality , anyone and everyone is helpless . 
  excerpt :  ** salman abedi ** , 22 , has been named by police as the suspected suicide bomber who killed 22 people and injured 59 at manchester arena on monday night . 
   the bbc understands he was ** manchester born ** and from a family of ** libyan origin ** . 
  asylum seekers * . 
  ( although likely to be economic migrants exploiting the asylum process , generous tolerance and low rate of deportations . ), 
  yes i agree on the rest of the points, 
  i doubt it was money laundering ( their public statement says very little about the reasons ) but if you see the later implication , it 's clear that that these users were withdrawing too many times and it became costly to them . 
  they just do n't want to admit it because they did promised free withdrawal unlimited amount of time . 
  the policy now : 5 free withdrawals in germany per month if you use n26 as your wage receiving account or under 27 years old . 
  otherwise , 3 free withdrawals in germany per month . 
  not sure in belgium , but in germany banks can apparently block and even deactivate accounts without giving proper reason . 
  google n26 account deactivations when you 'll fine a bunch of rage over the internet . 
   germans do n't have a sense of humor i do n't know why you immediately presume he 's german , but either way you 're a racist fuck . 
  also , which part of endangering the life of someone is humorous to you ? 
   i had a holiday that week not a good excuse . 
  there were follow-ups after the immediate incidence . 
  the arrest , the confession and the death of a fifth victim succumbed to her injuries few weeks after . 
  [ confirmed 19 now . 
   anything at all the past years so christmas market victims were ` barely anything ' to you ? 
  one innocent death from terrorism is one too much . 
   what attack on sweden was there ? 
  are you stupid ? 
  [ it was just last month . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39564825 ), 
  yeah that 's very suggestive way to phrase it . 
  he should condemn turkey 's actions in our nation 's capital and celebrate americans ' right to protest . 
  if you have n't realised , trump is a salesman . 
  he tells things that his customers want to hear . 
  it used to be the spiteful republicans during the election , now his customers are world leaders . 
  which is why he toned down his islam-hating rhetoric in saudi arabia . 
  us , as it is currently represented , has no stance in on any sides now , even for human rights . 
   hunday hyundai *  if you drive an electric car , which gets the electricity exclusivly from a coal power plant , good news . 
  coal plants are getting more and more irrelevant in europe . 
   in any country where guns are common , it 's very foolish assume a burglar is n't armed . 
  sounds like the egg and chicken problem to me . 
  this never ending vicious cycle while the men behind nra is counting their bucks . 
  you just supply link to a data without elaborating anything . 
  guess how much points i 'd give to you if i 'm marking your paper . 
  please at least provide some analysis rather than trying to throw raw numbers at people . 
  and no , it is not trivially clear what you are going to convey . 
  it 's a classic case of delusional of an idealist . 
  just like ang san suu kyi , the idealists over at the green could not overcome the reality that hits them . 
  sure they can protest all they want while they were outsider . 
  but once they are brought in , however , they realised ideals have so many strings attached to it . 
  they failed on their over idealistic manifesto , therefore it 's rightly that they should perish . 
  i 'm pretty sure the stuttgarters want to see green hanged right now , especially with the hauptbahnhof business . 
  we have green here and yet that did n't stop them voting for student fee reintroduction . 
  albeit for non-eu students . 
  have you not already met our little erdogan ? 
   for luggage theft , so people will avoid direct flights .
