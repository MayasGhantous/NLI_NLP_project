  [ article 50 : security is theresa may 's brexit secret weapon ] ( http://news.sky.com/story/article-50-security-is-theresa-mays-brexit-secret-weapon-10817785 ), 
   should it be treated as ` local new ' and be banned ? 
  if the [ franco a. news ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a4o8c/another_german_soldier_arrested_on_terror_charges/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link ) is allowed on this subreddit , i do n't see why this is not . 
  i trust the mod to be consistent . 
  besides , i dare say some of these refugees have travelled several european countries before arriving in berlin . 
  that 's rather eu wide no ? 
  oh / u/die-ente , we are eternally grateful that you decided to briefly leave / r/ukpolitics and bless us with your presence here in / r/europe . 
   the only side threatening mutual destruction is the eu with the threat of putting up trade barriers . 
  it 's only mutually destructive when the magnitude of said destruction is the same . 
  it is not . 
  do n't act as if theresa may did n't put her own threats to eu . 
  so you might want to clean your ass once awhile from sitting on your ivory toilet for far too long . 
  was the crack added ? 
  if the probability of drowning is about 1 % , guess what this number may imply on the number of successful crossings . 
  come back when you have a more constructive comment ; otherwise just stay in / r/the _ donald where the chances of your dick get jerk for your rubbish is higher . 
   huh ? 
  they 'll probably peel it off and try to sell it or something like that . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  some even destroyed it in the process . 
  regardless , there 's always someone there to reap something from it . 
   this was n't a conservative poster it may not be from conservative , but it certainly sounds very daily mail ` ish ( misspells , random capitalisation , slangs and blatantly shitpost ) kind of poster that supports the tories . 
  so technically , it 's a conservative poster ; just not a conservative poster . 
  i think the mural is rather balance . 
  it is like a piece of neutral news , it is a statement describing what is happening ( working class dismantling eu , credit to / u/sausageparty2015 ) rather than having a political statement . 
  but i think banksy real intention is to make it as vague as possible so the two sides will spin this off as theirs , hence more social exposure of said mural . 
  i hope no one destroy it ( like many of his paintings ) , because this will remind people one of two things in the future :  brexit was such a disaster . 
  we are at war with the continental and our economy is shit and we have the working class to thank for . 
  or  brexit was such a success . 
  we have our sovereignty back and our economy is awesome and we have the working class to thank for . 
  either way , thanks obama . 
  depends how macron will handle the terrorist attack . 
  if it handles well , both prevention and aftermath , then i suspect that leave little rooms for far right to rise . 
  that , however , takes a skilled politician , philosopher , leader to pull such a low-probability-high-impact events out . 
  i 'm interested to see how macron will address this . 
   have n't met a bad one yet try to be gay and hold your boyfriend 's hand in front of them ( about 5 people ) . 
  because i have . 
  and we got it even harder because my boyfriend is iranian , so they presume he 's arabic muslim and this must have automatically insulted their sacred religion . 
  we got out unscratched , nevertheless . 
  i do not dare to even think of the consequence if my bf told them he is a yahudi . 
  [ or try to be a muslim converting into christian . 
  ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/christian-refugee-converts-in-germany-face-violent-attacks/a-38725243 ) my bf told me that afghans and iraqis are , in general , more backward thinking , masochistic , religious , and prone to extremism than other middle eastern groups such as syrians . 
  no , you 're just not very bright . 
  to follow your logic  northern ireland voted to remain in the ~ ~ uk ~ ~ eu . 
  the rest of ~ ~ ireland ~ ~ uk ( really just england and wales ) voted to leave , what 's wrong with that ? 
  so the people got what they wanted ? 
  are you really saying those people who wanted to remain in the eu should have been forced to join england & wales on their nationalistic crusade , against ni will ? 
  how convenient . 
   those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it . 
  you missed my point . 
  i 'm trying to point out that we are living in an age where we are better human beings as we were in the ancient past . 
  some of us have crawled out of the past ; some of us did not . 
  therefore , bringing up the crusades and trying to argue via tu quoque is a weak argumentative fallacy . 
  which is why i said `` no , i do not remember the crusades '' not because i do n't know about the history of it ; but that it serves no purposes into explaining islamic barbarism in the modern age . 
   you do n't bully a bully to quit bullying . 
  no , but you should not condone their bullying by accommodating their ways of living as well . 
  why do you think muslims are the one being bullied here ? 
  in fact , i come from a muslims country and i grew up as a minority there . 
  therefore , i was able to see through all the hypocrisies whenever a sunni try to use their victim card unreasonably . 
   on the contrary , i said that ** all ** religions have extremist interpretations . 
  this statement is wrong . 
  all i need is to find one religion , or even one branch of religion to prove that statement is wrong . 
  have you heard of the chan ( zen ) school of buddhism ? 
  if my memory serves me right , it has never been at holy war with anyone or any branch of religion except for some in-fighting when passing the sari to the next successors . 
  but i do get what you mean : `` most ** theistic ** religions have their extreme interpretations . '', 
  however , you must recognise that some are more susceptible to extreme interpretation than the others . 
  one of the buddhist tenets , at its extreme form , is to refrain from killing , for any reasons and at anything ( including even an insects ) . 
  even if such a person is an enemies of yours . 
  abrahamic religion , however , have stories that smite their enemies and etc. 
  narrowing this down , islam is even more vindictive in its stories ( `` teachings '' ) especially through the book of hadith . 
  hadith is so flimsy , cruel , barbaric , and completely bizzare that even a ` moderate ' interpretation of it is deemed ` extremism ' . 
  and muslims are not allowed to refuse hadith because it is , according to them , the true lives of prophet muhammad . 
  christian and muslims have extremist views . 
  but one has more extremist followers than the other . 
  so much so one can actually get killed , in a developed country , in a modern ` liberal ' city such as paris , for insulting islam . 
  every vote of turkish matter in germany soil is postal vote . 
  but instead of having deutsche post sending your vote , you have the turkish consulates to do that on your behalf . 
  turkey do not have election systems like in the uk . 
   blocking the vote turkey have to ask for permission for any election held in germany . 
  germany has every rights to refuse that request . 
  turkish living in germany is still able to vote , but in turkey . 
  this is hardly `` blocking the vote '' . 
  more like inconveniences you . 
  if such an inconvenience is to put on referendum like death penalty , then i would happy welcome it . 
  i especially do when the german-turks who will not likely to live in turkey to vote for something so obscene . 
  let the referendum be decided by their own residents , not ` foreigners ' who will never taste the ` fruit ' that they sow . 
   integration is about accepting and respecting the rules and customs of a society and participiating in that society that sounds more like tolerance rather than integration . 
   remember the crusades ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  because i was not alive then . 
  what i do know is that i 'm living in the era where we humans are supposed to be more educated , understanding and all around rise above than our ancestors . 
  however , islam and most of its followers , in general , have not been doing that . 
  also while you like bring up the crusades so much , do remember that at that time the muslims at the same era were at least equally barbaric . 
   but if this happened to le pen ? 
  `` shes being picked on so unfairly '' have n't you realised ? 
  people who aligned themselves with putin do n't get their shits leaked , ever . 
   western intellectuals should openly criticize islam and then some local born muslim will come with a blade and chop your head off . 
  that 's the islam we are all familiar with . 
  eu is easier to blame because it 's more popular . 
  plus they probably need some of the russian oligarch business . 
   enacting the result of a referendum voted by 52 % of the voting population , of which mainly made up of middle aged and older people .
