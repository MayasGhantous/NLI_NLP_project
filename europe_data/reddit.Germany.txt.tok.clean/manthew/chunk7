  if permanent residency is approve , your children will be subjected to national service as with all other singapore citizens,

   opinion piece of a nobel prize winner . 
  stiglitz has been embarrassing the whole macroeconomics field about 5 years ago . 
  his ( shared ) nobel prize winning paper was good ; but he decided to be a blogger rather than an economist after that . 
  he stopped publishing anything that 's particularly good lately to be honest ; he has , however , been making a lot of noises with his blog . 
  he is n't turkish . . points proven . 
  we can all go home now, 
  not all states have capital penalty . 
  obama is only islamic in certain states . 
  instead , they should just let the terrorists take their lives . 
  it seems to me that current french government has been , time and time , fail to prevent medium to large scale terrorism from happening . 
  sure , they sometimes foil plans here and there . 
  but terrorist attack , like nuclear warheads , can be devastating when you even let one slip pass your radar . 
  blacklivesmatter, 
  whilst saudi arabian citizens are well known for their wahhabism funding . 
  i think the government is relatively * less radical than them . 
  also imported black lives . 
  would need a source on that, 
  next he 's going to call the whole eu fascist union . 
  they have n't seen what the real far-right president would say if he gets elected . 
   ca n't take people like that and just keep the social migrants out how do you prove gayness . . and how do you prove economic migrants ? 
  people lie when the chances is favourable . 
  fixed the eu part . 
  you happy now ? 
  this serves as an example of brexiteer 's argument : non-eu get certain citizenship from nation that have freedom of moment with uk and lax citizenship requirement . 
  and once they got it , they move to the uk . 
  ca n't believe you 're making me do this at 1.30 am . 
  anyway , i will play your game . 
   maylasia has a higher gdp per capita ... within two years they will surpass portugal first of all , you said gdp per capita . 
  it does not automatically imply purchase power parity . 
  at nominal value , malaysia drops far behind portugal . 
  sure , in terms of ppp , malaysia do have better stance than portugal . 
  but this is because the `` cost basket '' for a typical malaysian is a lot more lighter than a portuguese . 
  on top of that , it is based on relative price exchange . 
  besides that , it completely regards currency as an exogenous variable . 
  fourthly , the ppp calculation takes a rather weights on currency exchange . 
  and these are problems that i 'm aware with ppp calculation and interpretation ; there are tons of flaws out there , but i guess you can google them . 
  in conclusion , despite that it is , to certain extent , a measure to the well-being of a country ; you can not completely rely on that stats alone . 
  now quoting ppp is usually fine by me . 
  however , it would seem that you cherry-picked it because the nominal gdp ( i.e. 
  the face value calculation ) was not in your favour but still you hail your ppp up high and say `` this solves everyone 's problem and i 'm completely right . . 
  i win . 
  in yerrr face '' . 
  sorry , `` babe '' , i 'm afraid you just do n't understand the implications behind what these stats mean and what they are used for . 
  also that 's no how your source imf . 
  maybe you should learn more about quoting sources before someone laughs at your incompetence . 
   malaysia is growing by 3 % -4 \u2105 while portugal is stagnanting below 1 \u2105 ... 
  they will surpass portugal hands down ever heard of solow growth model ? 
  in macroeconomics , when a student starts to deal with theoretical model , the first thing they will come across is this model . 
  because this model is the most fundamental and the most basic macroeconomic model there is . 
  it has , however , a tons of unrealistic assumptions but it does explain the general trend in the countries ' economic behaviour . 
  the one i 'd like to bring to your attention is `` convergence '' . 
  it goes like this : `` countries which have low capital per worker will always grow faster than the countries which already have high level of capital per worker . . assuming that they have same production function and characteristics ( usually a cobb-douglas function is used because it can statisfies the inada conditions . . but i digress ) before they research their respective steady state '' analytically speaking it goes something like this ( in latex form ) : \\ dot ( y ( t ) ) = \\ left ( \\ frac { s } { \\ rho + n + \\ delta } \\ right ) ^ { \\ frac { \\ alpha } { 1 - \\ alpha } } where \\ dot ( y ( t ) ) = output growth s = saving rate n = population growth \\ pi = rate of labour augmented technology growth \\ delta = depreciation rate \\ alpha = elasticity of capital to output or [ graphically ] ( http://images.slideplayer.com/24/7436465/slides/slide_21.jpg ) . 
  where `` growth '' is the gradient of the line . 
  anyway , it should be no surpise that poorer country grow faster than richer ones . 
  so 4 % and 1 % growth respectively is a fine number for me , nothing extraordinary . 
  but will malaysia stay on 4 % path ? 
  unlikely , both empirically and theoretically . 
  now that was assuming that both countries have the same production function right ? 
  now , let 's be a little bit more realistic . 
  portugal generally have higher capital and its capital elasticity is generally higher than malaysia . 
  from solow model , we know that in long-run , countries will converge to a steady state . 
  however , if the production function differs , both countries will have different steady states . 
  it is highly possible that portugal steady-state is higher than malaysia . 
  to see this theoretically : dk/dt = s * y ( t ) - ( \\ pi + n \\ delta ) * k ( t ) dk/dt = capital grwth k ( t ) = current capital level y ( t ) = current output steady state is achieved when dk/dt = 0 . 
  i hope this helps in that cherry-picking mind of yours . 
  in conclusion , it is unlikely malaysia to over take portugal dramatically . 
  it will at most converges to portugal . 
  and that is in term of ppp right . 
  in terms of nominal gdp p capita , there are still a lot more room . 
  and i mean , a lot more . 
  however , i do recognise circumstances changes ; that 's why the model gets complicated with stochastic processes , but that 's for another day , another lesson . 
  ( then again , you just wasted my 45mins . . 
  i get paid 13.25 euro per hour in ta/ra job , now you owe me a pizza )  no they arent , there is nothing to back you [ how about this ? 
  ] ( http://malaysiandigest.com/opinion/487212-wawasan-2020-a-vision-impossible.html ) or the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wawasan_2020 ) you like to use so much . 
  we needed 8 % growth in average from 1991 to reach the goal . . as you already quoted the number , we wont make it . 
  source : not only am malaysian . 
  am also applied-mathematician specialise in dynamic model ( applying on macroeconomic and differential games ) who so happened to have lectured for economics growth ( albeit bachelor level ) just last semester . 
  so , next time , perhaps you want to evaluate your stats before you abuse them . 
  or just bark at some other easier trees in / r/the _ donald , you silly hag . 
   by 2020 . . an official developed country wawasan 2020 was a goal set by the government 30 over years ago . 
  they are going to miss the target by long shot . 
  malaysia is as corrupt as russian government , just without a nuclear arsenals . 
  the rural muslims are getting more and more radical just like turkey . 
  the constitution is still openly racists and oppressive against non-muslims . 
  oh and your data regarding about gdp per capita is wrong . 
  source : am chinese-malaysian . . got the fuck out from that ailing ship . 
   england man is that a new way of calling englishman now ? 
  actually , i 'm really committed one of the biggest sin there . 
  it is now twenty past 4am and i am really hungry so thought i would just ` cheat ' anyway . 
  without going to details . 
  to properly compare the odds of being killed in a terrorist attack and being killed ( not struck ) by lightning , you need to account the fact that where will you likely will be .
