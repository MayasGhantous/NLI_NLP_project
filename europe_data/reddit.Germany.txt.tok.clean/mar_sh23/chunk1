did it work ? 
  if it did , i 'll spend my next vacation in denmark ... 
  but luther at least had something to say , that would change the world , which he wanted to underline with his `` happening '' . 
  jensen only wanted to make his `` own happening '' . 
  the only statement in that is `` i 'm a dumb attention whore '' . 
  really ? 
  and how much is the euro underrated for the \u00cele-de-france / basque country/south tyrol and overrated for french guiana / extremadura / calabria ? 
  transylvania used to be kinda german though ... 
  is someone , who is n't willing to learn [ one of the most useful languages ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9487434/graduate-jobs-best-languages-to-study.html?frame=2314790 ) for a management job at the [ 9th largest company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_companies_by_revenue ) in the world , really someone you 'd want to give such a position ? 
  they do n't seem to be very good at cost-benefit-analysis !, 
  also : is it called `` vee double-u '' now ? 
  it all depends on how you ask the questions : - `` should you be able to encrypt your messages ? 
  - `` yes '' - `` should terrorists be tracked ? '', 
  - `` yes '' * `` europeans against surveillance and call for more surveillance '' *, 
  it is a great gesture . 
  thank you austria !, 
  but ... but ... who then , graced the queen with her title ? 
  i know and germany is also paying more than we are receiving . 
  but i was thanking the netherlands as a * european * not as a german . 
  i completely agree though , germany tooooootally should have invaded the soviet union to liberate eastern europe . 
  we should have launched an attack sometime in winter , that way they would have never seen it coming ... would have worked out great, 
  thank you netherlands , 
  i have to admit ... that stung . 
  even though i 'm a hessian ebbelwoi-drinker . 
  i think germany should be governed by whoever germans elect , regardless what southern europeans think about it ... 
  it 's shorter than `` postponement of the repitition of the run-off-election for president of the federation '', 
  there is no `` neutral '' . 
  you 're either our enemy or you 're austria !, 
  why is it stupid to let people elect whomever they want to ? 
  i think it 's rather democratic ... 
  there have n't any problems arisen from it so far . 
  the chancellors have n't used there time in office to change the system to ensure their re-election , as putin or erdogan did . 
  there powers are too limited to do that , which seems to make a restriciton in office terms unnecessary . 
  in case of frankfurt it was that they pursued becoming germany 's capital . 
  being federal capital and of a ( non city ) state , was n't considered possible . 
  i do n't think they 're supposed to be capitals . 
  lots of regions have two cities marked on the map , so they 're probably just for orientation . 
  ( but if they were capitals cologne as capital for north rhine-westphalia would also be an interesting choice  ), 
  most dutch name conceivable ... 
  because if there was one thing finland needed , it was something dark ... 
  beer should be illegal in hessen !,

  he does realize that sch\u00e4uble * will * keep the doucment , unless we get our money , right ? 
  i think it might be positive for germany . 
  if he pitches turkey against germany , ethnic turks will feel pressure to choose between germany and turkey . 
   do you honestly think stalin ** would 've ** stopped at berlin ? 
  he 'd ** ~ ~ of ~ ~ have ** painted the continent red ,, 
  does anyone know what percentage of students actually goes on an erasmus semster ? 
  depressions made in finland are the most crippeling depressions !, 
  while it is true that the cdu/csu dragged anti-material-rape legislation out for a disturbingly long time , they too wanted to punish material rape as soon as the debate started ( just not as hard as non-material rap , which was stupid ) and the issue was finally resolved in the 90ies . 
  i 'm sure there are 21 ^ st century issues you could criticize , like them being against marriage equality . 
  much more relevant today . 
  i hope she frames it and hangs it the kanzerlamt . 
  or she could stick it to the replica of the liberty bell in berlin ... 
  dear mr andre , we have received intelligence that you performed humorous acts ~ ~ at ~ ~ yesterday in a non-german-visited area and in the presence of a non-german . 
  the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of german humour has resulted in your expulsion from germany . 
  ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your personalausweis . 
  as you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under section 13 of the interstate confederation of german humorist 's statute of secrecy , we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of humor at 9 a.m. on the twelfth of august . 
  hoping you are well , yours sincerely , mafalda hopkirk improper use of humor office ministry of humor, 
  federal ministry for anyone but single , working-aged men, 
  if anything you owe us money for the teutonic state , forcolluding with lithuania to steal their land !, 
  for most of that time we have been killing each other though , so that all evens out . 
  colonialism would be the big issue for us ... 
  wind can disperse radiation very far away . 
  even tody you ca n't eat mushrooms from bavaria , because of chernobyl . 
  i 'm so jealous . 
  why ca n't we be like that : /, 
  and yet , 1957 france offered germany and italy to develop nuclear weapons together , because they did n't want to rely on the usa . 
  it had to be kept secret , because germany had already agreed to never have nukes . 
  de gaulle scrapped the plans immediately when he took over the government . 
  [ unfortunately i only have a german source ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/deutsche-aufruestung-a-947286.html ), 
  i just assumed it was , because the herero & nama are sueing us in new york right now and the namibian government is considering sueing us in the hague , because of the genocide and colonialism . 
  but have a look at what / u/frankonia said . 
  he seems to be more knowledgeable than i am . 
  namibia surprises me . 
  as far as i can tell , germany is rather is unpopular there , because of the colonial oppression . 
  especially , recently the relationship has been bad , because of different ideas over how to reconcile ... also : hey balkan buddies , 
  he is a bulgarian jew living in the netherlands , so your government forced him to put it there !, 
  finland is so far behind , that a dutchie does n't even bother making fun of them . 
  that must hurt ... 
  til there is no males in slavic fairytales ... 
  or do read them . 
  anyone who does will realize that neonazism actually a major problem and that many germans still need to be properly educated about the shit that happend . 
  [ what erdogan saw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsodagixpbo ), 
  i lost my cd :'(, 
  make germany holy , roman and imperial again !, 
  actually , germany destroyed more historic buildings from 1945 until the late 60ies on it 's own , than were destroyed in wwii . 
  yes , the war caused a lot of damage to our build heritage , but not as much city planers did , who thought that modernist and functionalist concrete blocks were more `` beuatiful '' , than actually beautiful buldings ... ( the same sentiment extisted in much of europe . ), 
  was n't that were the pope stayed in medici : masters of florence ? 
  you summoned us ? 
  france and germany should reunify already !, 
  whenever i see polls , which ask people to rate another country 's politics , i always think for 50 + % the honest answer would be `` i do n't know '' . the media only talk about the really big stuff happening in other countries , which leaves out a lot of context , and the things that are relevant to your own country , which will create a strong bias in the reporting and in the interpreation of the reports ( anyone will disagree with another country 's policy , if it is bad for their own country , even if it really is the best policy for that other country ) . 
  that being said , trump 's presidency was very bad so far ... 
  obviously the scots will finally complete their jacobite agenda to return to the stuart monarchy and will put the [ heir-general to king james ii of england and vii of scotland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz,_duke_of_bavaria ) on the throne, 
  i 'd let merkel grab my dick ...

  robert the bruce had it completely destroyed after re-taking it from the english , so they could n't get it back . 
  it was rebuilt under the stewarts starting in 15th century , as one great britains few renaissance palaces .
