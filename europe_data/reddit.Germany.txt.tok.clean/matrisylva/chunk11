  the swabs will take over berlin . 
  i think it 's around as likely as austria joining germany . 
  the secessionists are quite right wing and eurosceptic . 
  the secessionist bayernpartei was pretty strong shortly after the war but now no right wing party can stand a chance against the csu . 
  franconian independence from bavaria also seems unlikely . 
  it 's not true for all dutch possessions though : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kingdom_of_the_netherlands_location_tree.svg, 
  `` britain '' is n't a state . 
  the united kingdom is . 
  british overseas territories are not part of the uk . 
   if a train full with passengers is n't less polluting than a car , i 'll eat my damn shoe . 
  the people would n't have travelled by car necessarily , or not even traveled at all . 
  faster travel times make people more likely to travel more often . 
  commuting times for instance have n't changed that much historically , the distances on the other hand have . 
  the article does n't really reflect my opinion but i think it 's an point you should note . 
  politicians should get paid well so they can be independent . 
  the real issues are the other sources where they get money from . 
  this was discussed a bit a few years ago in germany . 
  essentially in some situations it has positive outcomes in other situations negative ones . 
  it can lead to people using public transport that did n't use it before . 
  there have been cases where homeless people made other people avoid public transport . 
  thanks there are no different words for child support and alimony in german . 
  biological paternity is taken way too serious . 
  you should n't have to pay child support and should n't be able to `` invade '' a family as a sperm donor . 
  it 's nice that prisoners are able to study . 
  the rules should n't be changed just because of breivik . 
  just join schengen . 
  times when the university class starts were traditionally noted down in germany as the full hour and s.t. 
  ( cum tempore - with academic quart ) . 
  so 12:00 c.t. 
  actually means 12:15, 
  spanish high-speed rail is relatively new . 
  the part where this seems to have happened is from 2011 : http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:ave.png, 
  it is a joke in germany . 
  for instance rocket internet just clones american startups and brings them to other countries than the us faster than the original startup . 
  they just need to manipulate the random number generator, 
  why not chinese ? 
  how well received is the fehmarn belt fixed link on the danish side ? 
  i heard about people on fehmarn being very critical of it . 
   we do n't want a christian wulff ... you want a karl-theodor maria nikolaus johann jacob philipp franz joseph sylvester freiherr von und zu guttenberg ? 
   loss of power even for a few seconds causes huge damage costs and even leads to death and injuries . 
  so what happens if there 's loss of power for days when there 's a heatwave like it often happens in france ? 
  systems important for life are backed up btw . 
  there 's even a subreddit dedicated to / r/erlangen though there is no action and i have n't posted there, 
  cars even often give me priority when i do n't have it because i 'm driving fast 2 . just lock it to a tree or the forest of traffic signs and street lamps , sometimes this takes a bit time at university 3 . 
  if i have locked it pretty safe 4 . do n't know / yes 5 . yes , i see people in suits on bicycles every now and then 6 . do n't know 7 . do n't think so in many parts of the city it could be better , but it 's really good compared to other cities in the region, 
  do you think that less people would agree to the tos if you would promise to give your firstborn to zuckerberg when signing it ? 
  i also had the same idea , but is it reachable by train ? 
  which countries have you already visited ? 
  it should be : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2009:266:0011:0018:en:pdf article 3, 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/eurobaro_attitudes_towards_tobacco_2012_en.pdf, 
  protip : transfer fees between countries of the euro zone and sweden are the same as within one of those countries i 'm not paying any fees afaik , but i 'm also getting special conditions as a student . 
  also in bavaria additionally bavarian history, 
  maybe they should have used the who data on alcohol consumption instead of the numbers of sold alcohol : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_alcohol_consumption, 
  nicotine on it 's own is still dangerous . 
  it 's highly addictive and has many [ side effects ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/side_effects_of_nicotine.svg ) . 
  also the flavourings are only tested for eating and not smoking , they may be bad for your lungs . 
  i guess that it 's still way better than smoking and i think most e-cig smokers anyway have been smokers beforehand . 
  i wonder what a sensible regulation for e-cigarettes would be . 
  cross border payments in euro and swedish krona cost the same as within the country . 
  because illegal immigrants profit from the welfare state, 
  there 's also an additional spike in the morning and one in the evening . 
  the generated power by photovoltaics actually matches the sine curve without the additional spikes quite well when looking at a bigger area . 
  you only need to solve the problem of building more power lines . 
  for natural gas : when were these plants built ? 
  the installed natgas capacity in germany has only gone up 7.2 % between 2000 and 2011 which is 1,6 gw . 
  renewables have gone up 54,4 gw in the same time , which although you ca n't directly compare them is a lot more . 
  [ ( source ) ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/installierte_leistung#installierte_leistung_in_deutschland ) i do n't know what you mean with orders for 80gw per year . 
  orders for new plants to be built ? 
  otherwise the unit gw/year does n't make much sense . 
  only a third of the gas in germany comes from russia and the part is shrinking because of the cheaper prices other countries offer . 
  germany has only very few shale gas deposits , they 're on place 20 and not 2 according to this : ( http://www.bgr.bund.de/de/themen/energie/downloads/bgr_schiefergaspotenzial_in_deutschland_2012.pdf?__blob=publicationfile page 23 ) the estimated 1.3 trillion cubic meters recoverable gas would only last 13 years with the current rate of consumption . 
  what you also should n't forget about shale gas in the usa is that there was too much investment into it and now make losses . 
  prices would also be higher because of better environmental protection . 
  it would be cheap , but still not as cheap as in the usa . 
  there are also huge spikes and dips in the use of electricity . 
  nuclear reactor output is only very slowly regulatable . 
  germany may be not that sunny , but it 's also not that hot ( photovoltaics loose efficiency when they 're hot ), 
  the usa spying on eu institutions is only an issue of national security and should be no concern for the eu ? 
  you also forgot that silly law that bavaria had : only motorists were allowed to buy alcohol after 8 pm at gas stations . 
  everybody that is n't peer steinbr\u00fcck, 
  as i heard berlin is a minefield of dog poop . 
  the czech republic does n't have the euro either . 
  wrong , it 's enough to spy on someone that does all the spying . 
  night shifts have bad health effects . 
  just think of the people that have to work there . 
  for them it really sucks , for customers it 's just a minor inconvenience . 
  i think it 's easy to plan your day in such a way that you can go shopping before 8 pm . 
  too bad if you ca n't persuade your friends to watch them in english though, 
  it should also be noted that the laws in bavaria are the strictest in germany , so shops are also closing relatively early on weekdays . 
  it also has the most days tanzverbot ( = loud music and dancing is forbidden ), 
  food industry and wanting to do a decent job . 
  hahahahaha . 
  there 's regularly food sold as `` no glutamate added '' in which the glutamate is replaced by yeast extract , which contains glutamate . 
  and there are many many more examples where the food industry tries to fuck you over . 
  sadly everything in german tv is dubbed . 
  so i acquired an english skill exceeding the one taught in school relatively late . 
  what really helped me were pirated tv series with english subtitles . 
  this paved the way for even more english media like books or articles ( thanks reddit ), 
  the german viewpoint afaik is that the netherlands fucked up , because they did n't present enough evidence . 
  he would have had to be prosecuted in germany , because it was n't allowed to extradite germans until 2004 , which also afaik the netherlands did n't want .
