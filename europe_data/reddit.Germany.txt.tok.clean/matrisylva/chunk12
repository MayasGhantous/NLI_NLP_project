  dirk niebel wanted to kill of the ministry and now is the minister of it , you see how this worked out . 
  international diplomacy is one reason why it is n't possible . 
  so you 're saying that they knowingly ran unsafe reactors ? 
  does n't mean that they do n't have new problems that may be even bigger . 
  there already were thorium reactors in germany that were promised to be safer and better in every aspect ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kernkraftwerk_thtr-300#probleme_und_st.c3.b6rf.c3.a4lle ) , but are definitely a failed project . 
  most problems of nuclear reactors are unforeseen . 
  nobody thought the chernobyl accident was possible . 
  nobody thought the fukushima accident was possible , because it was n't an old soviet reactor . 
  nobody thinks that a similar accident is possible in germany because there are n't tsunamis in germany . 
  i think many pro nuclear people are nearly as foolish as most anti nuclear people . 
  they have a model of how nuclear reactors work . 
  in this model nuclear reactors are safe . 
  what they forget is that models are only an approximation of the reality . 
  i once was very excited about gen iv reactors , until one evening where i talked with a siemens engineer working in olkiluoto and someone working for areva . 
  the areva guy told me how far off gen iv reactors are ( 2030 if everything works out , which is very unlikely ) . 
  the siemens engineer told me how much botching happens in olkiluoto , which leads to many things being rebuilt . 
  in the timeframe in which a substantial amount of energy in germany could be generated by gen iv reactors , germany will already have completed its energy transition . 
  that all said , i still think that iter is an important project and i also think that the money going to iter is n't wrongly spent . 
  read this and you 're baffled and shocked even more . 
  i voted the same . 
  the first point is important to make the eu feel less than just a bunch of countries . 
  the other two are important to keep and extend the role of europe as a continent of intellectual people . 
  also they just use the cheap gas which has lower co2 emissions when burned . 
  the graphic is only about primary education, 
  maybe because they were even initiated by russia and they said that they would follow them ? 
  you are n't allowed to steal cultural artifacts in a war . 
  it 's prohibited by the hague conventions . 
  however many countries ignored this in ww2 . 
   weaker in europe than in almost any other part of the world there 's still plenty of religious influence on politics in europe . 
  afaik china and japan are secular countries . 
  too bad britain , russia and japan have three different track gauges http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/track_gauge, 
  deposit is ( maximum ) three times the monthly rent in germany , so it 's higher if you do n't move into rural areas . 
  it 's the [ flag of europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) and also used by the council of europe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_police_officers if you sort for police officers per capita , most of the top countries will be small ones . 
  it 's a very strange relation . 
  it would be nice if someone plotted police per 100000 capita and inhabitants of a country on a map . 
  i 'm just saying that 3 $ is n't that much . 
  one one hand i can see why quality media costs so much , on the other hand there 's a lot of valid criticism . 
  it 's because of a stupid arms race with turkey i heard . 
  germany and france sell weapons to both countries . 
  3 $ per month ? 
  that 's fucking cheap . 
  you have to pay 17,98 $ in germany . 
  into the ersatzcloud, 
  til milton friedmann is a far-left nutjob . 
  use bittorrent sync instead of dropbox , so nobody can snoop on you anymore, 
  http://www.openstack.org/ afaik using us clouds for your services may even be illegal , when what i read on hacker news is right . 
  also the northern part of serbia and kaliningrad have the same color . 
  it seems mor that russia is the wrong color . 
  germany is way bigger than portugal , so the wine sector is n't as important in germany . 
  here have some geh\u00e4ck ( speak : keck , raw inner part of a franconian bratwurst ) on it : http://img2.blogs.yahoo.co.jp/ybi/1/d6/c9/elli_katze/folder/1500454/img_1500454_58243064_6?1222358750 traditionally caraway is heavily used in franconian bread, 
  there are many parts of the government that are n't to dependent on how much people live in a country . 
  there 's no big difference between making a law for ten thousand or ten million citizens . 
  when you have masses of people you can treat similiar cases by experts in governmental institutions . 
  when your country has 4 times the area it only has 2 times the borders . 
  making things efficient only works to a point and also is n't the reason why some states have low taxes . 
  it 's because they 're small enough to be able to attract rich people with low taxes and still keep their system going . 
  because such states are so small they 're often even more inefficient . 
  for example monaco has the most police officers per capita in the world . 
  why are you trying to discuss this subject here ? 
  clearly you 're not interested in europe . 
  also repeating that `` i do n't know dick '' about agriculture wo n't make it any more right . 
  being a farmer in the us does n't mean that you know how farming is done on the rest of the world . 
  it also does n't mean that you know anything about gene modification . 
  you constantly spewing around how wrong i am without any real arguments shows how much you really know . 
  there is actually a second line between nuremberg and wuerzburg that 's longer and goes over erlangen bamberg and schweinfurt . 
  if you took the ice you mean the same line as i do . 
  i grew up near that line btw . 
  the straight line between nuremberg and wuerzburg ca n't be explained like that . 
  it 's a train line where you only have a very spotty internet connection . 
   what have you developed with your own money and effort that benefits the whole world and gave away without compensation ? 
  what a silly question , but i will give an answer anyways : open source code i wrote and map data i collected for openstreetmap . 
   i doubt you know where it grows though , because you do n't know dick about agriculture . 
  i know where it 's grown . 
  do you know where woodruff grows ? 
   good , now i know who one of the idiots are that 's passing out downvotes to whomever is n't going along with the circlejerk in this thread . 
  as far as i can see only people that have n't posted in / r/europe before and have their history full of pro-gmo stuff are affected . 
  bt is bacillus thuringiensis , i guess you mean the bt genes that are responsible for producing the bt toxin . 
  i do n't know what you think is wrong with what i said . 
  even wikipedia says that plants with the bt genes are `` pesticide-producing crop [ s ] '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bt_toxin#use_of_bt_genes_in_genetic_engineering_of_plants_for_pest_control  i 'd love to be a genie that could turn you into a cotton farmer and watch you try to deal with boll weevils without a bt product . 
  cotton does n't grow where i live . 
   plant patents predate gmos by over a half century , but you 're commenting as if it 's a new trend . 
  they 're not as old in europe , and it 's a relatively new trend to use patents additionally to plant breeders ' rights for plant varieties . 
  you can resow * every plant variety that is n't a hybrid and the plant breeders right is only 25 to 30 years here in germany . 
  advancements are n't really fast in breeding . 
  interesting to know that now you can also patent non-gm gene mutations in some countries . 
  this is a bad trend . 
  you 're right that there are many people against gmos that do n't have any clue , but there 's also much bullshit spewed by pro-gmo people . 
  for instance it 's often stated that gmos reduce the need for pesticides . 
  what they do n't tell is that most gene modifications that are done to plants are adding the capability to produce pesticides themselves . 
  or it 's stated that no further tests are needed , and gmo-plants can be seen just as a normal variety of the plant . 
  that 's clearly wrong for gene modifications that let plants produce new chemicals , where that behaviour could n't have been induced by traditional breeding . 
  a glofish is n't a zebrafish , it 's a zebrafish with added green green fluorescent protein . 
  * or clone, 
  at least horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and plants/animals happens ( but quite uncommon ) . 
  i guess you 're meaning plants that are hybrids . 
  only some plants are usually hybrids , because not all exhibit [ heterosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heterosis#in_plants ), 
  at least the farmers i know still do for wheat . 
  what i find funny about many gmo supporters , is how they never say for what gene modification is mainly used : - letting plants produce the pesticides themselves ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacillus_thuringiensis#use_of_bt_genes_in_genetic_engineering_of_plants_for_pest_control ) . 
  this is often twisted into `` you do n't have to use as much pesticides anymore '' - resistance against herbicides , so that the crops can be sprayed with them .
