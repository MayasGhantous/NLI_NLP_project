  there are many things where it could be argued that are more `` connected '' to the lives of the people that they do n't know about . 
  for example i daily see birds around me , but can name only very few of them . 
  there are some vegetables where i do n't know how the plant looks like . 
  ( for example ginger ), 
  we also are n't conditioned to hate neoliberalism because of dictators like pinochet, 
  i think what a parliament is often better at is coming up with a solution that satisfies most people , in direct democracy there are more often extreme solutions that win only by a small margin . 
  for example the anti-smoking laws in bavaria that were voted for by direct democracy are the hardest in whole germany . 
  on the other hand the csu tries right now to ignore the decision of the german federal constitutional court to allow gay adoptions for the partners children . 
  be careful what you say or the italian president wo n't come visit you . 
  and we franconians love our keck ( short for bratwurstgeh\u00e4ck , the raw inside of a bratwurst ) . 
  the rest of germany does n't know on what it 's missing out . 
  the best thing is when the butcher does n't have any keck left they will cut open the bratwursts and you 'll get keck anyway . 
  you forgot to mention sorbian which is a slavic language spoken by a few people . 
  they even learn standard german in the non german speaking parts of switzerland and subsequently ca n't understand their own people . 
  it 's already here in franconia, 
  i think we germans can let history be history . 
  this also has good consequences . 
  nobody here demands pre-1945 borders back and this gives us the opportunity to have friendship to neighboring countries . 
  people in other countries ca n't seem to let history rest and still have conflicts because of some silly thing decades or centuries ago . 
  hmm i guess i 'm wrong . 
  i imagine i have somewhere read something about a failed referendum about the border . 
  i guess it was something about this treaty : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco-dutch_treaty_on_saint_martin_border_controls, 
  but scotland is n't a oversea territory . 
  also it normally means more controls . 
  for example there is border control on the french dutch border on st. martin, 
   # 8 obey the red man  15 . 
  feel mixed about berlin those fit together because nobody in berlin cares about traffic light . 
  sorry i forgot about the special situation of denmark . 
  but the rest of the eu countries have to join the eurozone ( except the uk and sweden ) we will see if the euro will collapse ( i do n't think so ) or if the flaws will be corrected . 
  actually it does mean that you have to join the eurozone , but my point was that latvia and lithuania already have most effects of the euro . 
  they ca n't devalue their currency for example . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_exchange_rate_mechanism#exchange_rate_bands they 're already pegged to the euro, 
  a few years ago opera had two different versions . 
  one that did cost money and one that had ads . 
  depends on where in germany http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/europe_religion_map.png/737px-europe_religion_map.png http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/verbreitung_der_konfessionen_im_deutschen_reich.jpg bavaria without franconia is still very catholic, 
  the same exists here in germany for kindergartens and hospitals . 
  when you marry the second time , you will get fired . 
  when you 're outing yourself as gay they sometimes fire you . 
  but you do n't have to be catholic to get the job . 
  til iceland has sent an astronaut to the moon . 
  actually the trade surplus is not only because of the eurozone . 
  http://c1.ftd.de/wirtschaftswunder/imgs/kolumne/kolumne20111124.jpg in 2012 germany even had a trade surplus with china edit : ah that 's percent . 
  here are the numbers : https://www.destatis.de/de/zahlenfakten/gesamtwirtschaftumwelt/aussenhandel/handelspartner/tabellen/rangfolgehandelspartner.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ( fourth column ) there are some eurozone countries that export more from germany than they import : slovenia , ireland , the netherlands , the vatican state , slovakia . 
  and there are also several countries outside the eurozone where germany has an trade surplus like the us, 
  oh god nobody thought of that !, 
  now germany will stop using solar, 
  history books were abolished because of the austerity . 
  also at least here in germany sperm donors are obliged to pay child support and children have a right to know their biological parents . 
  i think here the effects on the genes are overrated . 
  it 's really not as bad in germany . 
  if the name is rejected as not obviously male or female you just add some male/female name to the passport that you will never use . 
  ( almost everybody in germany has multiple given names . 
  i do n't even know all given names of my parents ), 
  cimbrian is just a sub dialect of bavarian . 
  high franconian would have been more fitting there . 
  i think when you get rid of the \u00df like the swiss ist gets even better : bier nur in massen geniessen . 
  this can mean drinking beer only in small amounts , drinking beer only out of 1 liter mugs or it can mean you need to drink masses of beer, 
  and portugal ? 
  not keeping yourself warm enough will weaken your immune system and make it more likely to catch a cold . 
  still i know some people that are going to far and are constantly wearing too much . 
  they also seem to constantly have the cold . 
  wo n't happen . 
  the eu is a democracy and the majority wants the cap to stay . 
  still the uk is paying even less than belgium . 
  fairness sounds like a good point . 
  let 's begin with abolishing the uk rebate, 
  sp\u00e4tzle is n't really franconian food it comes from our swabian neighbors . 
  you know how it is in reality . 
  people vote for politicians only because of few things if they 're not voting for them because they always have just like their parents . 
  people really ca n't know everything what their politicians do and politicians do n't do what he people want ( which often can be good , the general population often has strong fears about the things they do n't know like islam ) . 
  and then there was also fraudulent behavior to hide the bad situation in greece until it was already too late, 
  japanese actually have one of the best conditions in the world . 
  they had the highest population densities as hunters and gatherers and stayed quite long hunters and gatherers because their nature gave them so plenty to live off . 
  who is they ? 
  do you know everything about what your representatives do ? 
  fuck you america !, 
  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_franconia.svg ( though its very uncommon without the coat of arms ), 
  the maps of european countries are the only thing that / r/europe has taught me, 
  also only legal tender in the country they are minted in . 
  absinthe was legalized in many countries because of european free trade . 
  snus on the other hand is illegal in the whole eu except sweden . 
  when did you take the lessons ? 
  1600 $ seems a bit cheap to me ( i would have guessed 2000 $ is a normal price now ), 
   in the case of students through your parents til a certain age ( at which point you probably wo n't pay in excess of 30 $ / mo ) . 
  your parents do n't have to pay for you , you are included by default . 
  also prizes for students is more like 80 $ , but you get more baf\u00f6g if you have to pay for your insurance yourself, 
  also w\u00fcrzburg is most likely not from gew\u00fcrz burg ( = herb castle ) but from castle of virtius according to wikipedia, 
  this is also the new rubel . 
  on wikipedia there are half an old rubel banknotes shown ( 1000 old rubel = 1 new rubel ) they 're now worth not even 0,0000005 eurocents, 
  it 's the little things you do n't really notice . 
  there was a study done here in bavaria which showed that boys had to perform better to get a `` gymnasialempfehlung '' . 
  out of my class i was the only boy to receive one , but i had to do the 5th grade twice for it because they deemed me not mature enough ( the study says this is a common reason why boys do n't get one ) . 
  the gap between rich an poor children how much they have to achieve is even bigger btw . 
  one interesting thing was that male teachers discriminate more against boys than female ones . 
  that all said i think it 's a stupid thing to see feminists as the culprits . 
  `` the law , in its majestic equality , forbids the rich and the poor alike to sleep under bridges , to beg in the streets , and to steal bread . '', 
  i have n't seen a cheque ever in my life, 
  200 $ and 500 $ banknotes are n't given out by bank automates in germany either, 
  what i hate most about bicycling in winter is n't snow or ice but the dirty half molten mass, 
  also without franconia , bavaria and baw\u00fc the rest of germany should get an prussian flag,
