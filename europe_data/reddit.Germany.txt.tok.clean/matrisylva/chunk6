  making heating renewable actually is harder than making electricity renewable . 
  especially if you do n't have such huge forests . 
  unlikely . 
  the german nuclear reactors would have been needed to stop anyway as they 're getting too old ( the first nuclear exit actually was just not prolonging the lifetime of the reactors ) . 
  building new reactors is proving to be difficult because of strict security regulations and high wages in the construction sector . 
  estimated build time of olkiluoto 3 has been upped to 15 years from originally 4 . 
  flamanville 3 has similar problem . 
  the uk was only able to attract the building of a new reactor by offering # 92.50 / mwh ( 0.11161 euro cents per kilowatt-hour ) which will increase according to the inflation . 
  as a comparison , the guaranteed prices for photovoltaics in germany ranges between 9.19 and 13.28 cent/kwh depending on size . 
  for wind power it 's 5.02 cent/kwh on-shore and 2,5 cent/kwh off-shore . 
  the waste problem still is n't solved . 
  the germans also do n't like the tiny risk of nuclear catastrophes . 
  so you also would n't even be able to build new reactors because of protests . 
  even if you 're allowed to own weapons , the gun culture of americans usually is n't wanted here . 
  for instance you usually do n't shoot on human silhouette targets . 
  if you say stuff like `` if you own a gut you have to be able to shoot a person in a situation where it 's needed '' people will call the police . 
  immigrants gaming germany 's social system is a sensationalized non-problem . 
  you could pay 1000 people hartz iv for 4 years from the tax uli hoene\u00df did n't pay alone . 
  obviously greece has too high labour cost , they 're not competitive with sweden or germany . 
  needs more austerity to reduce the labour costs even more !, 
  results are on page 8, 
  please just stop with the crap . 
  no more threads . 
  i guess such a taskforce would n't be able to do much . 
  systematic changes like more transparency are way more important imo . 
  sadly it most likely would be impossible here in germany to have mandatory vaccination . 
  building a house , pah . 
  most people ca n't afford that . 
  strange that i have n't read anything about that in german news yet . 
  wages under 5 $ per hour are n't uncommon in some sectors . 
  mass unpaid overtime is also very common . 
  this is n't healthy . 
  i hope minimum wage will at least lessen this . 
  at the moment most people are harmed by this . 
  in germany people have to work for wages that are too low to sustain themselves , in the rest of europe the economy is going down the drain . 
  well the idea was to prevent a full-blown war, 
  norway or the azores were even further away from the main war zones in wwii but also played important roles . 
  nuclear is mostly replaced with renewables and sadly coal in germany , not natural gas . 
  nuclear power can only power base load and thus ca n't replace natural gas . 
  as a comparative value : germany exported 22,8 twh more than it imported in electric energy 2012 . 
  did n't it simply start out as a ligature like \u00e6 did ? 
  uranium mining actually had a bad impact : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wismut_ ( mining_company ) #impact _ on_employees until 2009 cleaning up did cost 5.3 billion euro and there 's still lots to do . 
  places do n't need to be directly at the frontline to have an important tactical role . 
  the bridges certainly were n't bombed for fun and giggles . 
  i guess the problem there is that they are a bit more difficult to handle than normal waste ( you do n't exactly know what 's in the waste - maybe even nasty stuff like asbestos ? ), 
  the danish , they always kill zoo animals . 
  independent franconia from independent bavaria now !, 
  the problem of the incinerators are that they prevent recycling or reduction of the waste as you need to fill them constantly as soon as they are built . 
  at least that 's the problem here in germany . 
  some waste statistics : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/waste_statistics, 
  most likely i remembered wrongly and it 's the same in germany . 
  there are also parts of autobahnen that can be transformed into airports . 
  bridges are tactically important . 
  until recently bridges here were build with blasting charges inside ( against a russian invasion i guess ) . 
  the nazis here even thought about letting the church tower fall down on the street so that the americans will be hindered advancing, 
  seems to be in the wrong order when it comes to hitler, 
  http://energia.fi/sites/default/files/dokumentit/tilastot-ja-julkaisut/district_heating_in_finland_2012_web.pdf page 4 . 
  most used is natural gas ( 27,4 % ), 
  http://www.indexmundi.com/map/?v=137000 the only nordic countries that use few natural gas are sweden ( 179 m \u00b3 / person ) , latvia ( 283 m \u00b3 / person ) and maybe estonia ( 550 m \u00b3 / person ) . 
  denmark ( 886 m \u00b3 / person ) and finland ( 909 m \u00b3 / person ) are pretty normal . 
  norway ( 1 402 m \u00b3 / person ) uses even more than germany ( 1 224 m \u00b3 / person ), 
  and significant parts of the district heating is by natural gas in finland ... district heating using nuclear is almost unheard of and mostly unfeasible . 
  district heating using hydropower does n't really exist . 
  sweden uses relatively few gas ( around a tenth of what germany uses per capita ) but not no natural gas at all, 
  electricity is just one form of energy . 
  heating for instance is n't usually done that much with electricity and therefore does n't really use nuclear or hydropower . 
  hydro and nuclear are only the main sources for electricity . 
  sweden even is an electricity importer . 
  further it imports lots of oil , some natural gas and does n't mine its own uranium . 
  that 's not basically energy independent like you said . 
  and all this although sweden probably has one of the best natural conditions . 
  the only country rated as energy independent by eurostat is denmark : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdcc310&amp;plugin=1, 
  tribes ? 
  are we living in ancient times ? 
  nuclear ca n't replace gas . 
  gas is used to regulate electric power production after the demand . 
  nuclear is the slowest electric power source in this regard . 
  btw germany is a also a net energy exporter and increased the net exports in the last years . 
  it 's not that good to speak in such broad terms . 
  coal plants emit more co_2 than gas turbines for the same amount of electric energy . 
  co_2 emissions are very important but not the only thing to consider . 
  with such a high population density safety of the ground water is a very important thing to consider , which is why there are so huge protests against fracking . 
  transnistria is even poorer afaik . 
  what ? 
  - the next german coal plant is 400km away ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bexbach_power_station ) . 
  one reason of the high pollution was too few wind . 
  - less then 10 % of the fine particular matter in germany are by the coal plants . 
  ( http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/419/dokumente/2012_12_12_em_entwicklung_in_d_trendtabelle_luft_v1.2.0_sauber.xlsx ) that 's bad and they need to be replaced by cleaner energy sources , but singling them out for the particular matter problem in france is insane . 
  i still pay 9 cent/sms , how is this possible ? 
  thanks for your answers . 
  i meant more subsidiarity inside of countries ( power from member states to even lower levels ) , but i guess that 's also answered . 
  so what do you want to replace gas with to regulate the production after the demand ? 
  coal plants can only do parts of it as they ca n't be regulated as fast . 
  nuclear reactors are by far the slowest of all ( though newer ones are a bit faster than older ones ) . 
  the concept of subsidiarity strikes me as one that helps ensuring democracy and implementation of the will of the people . 
  however some things have to be regulated at eu level to guarantee a common market and a united europe . 
  - how does the european parliament and the european commission decide whether something has to be regulated by the eu and not at more local levels ? 
  - are there any plans to get more subsidiarity in the member states ? 
  - what do you think that is currently regulated by the member states should better be decided at eu level ? 
  do you even read your own links ?
