of course somebody has to make a joke about wwii and national socialism when the topic is germany ... 
  that does n't show youth unemployment though , although i guess the heatmap would look quite the same . 
  yeah , that 's bavaria for you . 
  real numbers for all of germany would be higher though since there 's some trickery going on by the government to lower the stats . 
  look at some 60s german unemployment stats though , genuine * vollbesch\u00e4ftigung * , pretty much everybody had a job . 
  i 'd say it was rather what kept it together for such a long time in the first place . 
  before the berlin wall was erected * millions * have already fled to the west . 
  if the government had n't kept its people prisoners , the gdr would have gone bankrupt long before ' 90 . 
  edit : the relatives thing was obviously an instrument to put fear in the people 's minds , it was an open secret . 
  kind of like in gangster movies how they prevent traitors by saying they 'll go after their family . 
  so i would n't say it was a stupid thing to do from an oppressor 's point of view . 
  here we go again ... 
  hey sam !, 
  the euphoria is off the charts !, 
  yes , i am saying the `` crime '' is worse when commited on a girl . 
  because male circumcision does n't inflict serious complications and fgm does . 
  this has nothing to do with sexism . 
  i never said it was n't wrong but dude you are comparing fgm which causes a lot of physical and psychological pain with , well , male circumcision . 
  idk , i do n't think circumcised males are likely to have complications so it 's not viewed as cruel . 
  edit : [ / u/2 -4601 has made a good point ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28mww3/female_genital_mutilation_exposed_in_swedish/cichcya ), 
  huh , that 's interesting . 
  well , i 'm not a supporter of the green party anyway , i was just curious . 
   in any case , i was talking about a storage location that 's satisfactory for the relevant parties , which i do n't think we have one of . 
  agreed . 
  we 're in dire need of a safe storage facility but the problem will only become worse the more nuclear waste we produce . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm following you , but : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_kerntechnischer_anlagen#deutschland_4, 
  of course we have storage facilities , how do you think we can keep eight plants in operation ? 
  and the search for facilities was about suitable places for `` final storage '' , not temporary storage facilities . 
  also , why do you think the greens are chernobyl centered ? 
  yeah nuclear energy per kwh is cheap but atleast in germany the taxpayer bears the cost of nuclear waste storage and transportation . 
  de facto being a part of being administered by does n't mean belonging to . 
  if you consider dumping radioactive material into the ocean via pipelines right , that is . 
  what makes you think that lower energy usage = poverty ( = death ) ? 
  i 'd say by posting the link he makes an argument against the parent comment ( although the argument is technically made by someone else ) , so you could say it is a debate . 
  that 's how i see it but even if you do n't consider internet-dumbass 's comment as a debate you still should n't downvote it because it ** does ** create a lively discussion . 
  the top rows look just like regular euro coins . 
  germany 's unemployment figures are being falsified through so called `` mini-jobs '' or `` 1-euro-jobs '' , extremely low paid work for some of the unemployed which still costs the state a fortune because they do n't pay taxes nor dues related to healthcare and pensions and still have to receive unemployment benefits . 
  but the government does n't care since those lower the statistics . 
  anything for a good credit rating ... 
  this is not the original video of this gag though afaik . 
  her voice sucks for this joke . 
  somehow reminds me of harry potter and how fast that reporter bitch finished a book about dumbledore after his death . 
  we only have aaa from moody 's . 
  i demand capital letters !, 
  germany does n't . 
  would you consider [ literally dumping ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qzeguew59ak#t=316 ) simple metal barrels filled with highly radioactive material into an old salt mine with more water leaks than an open dam a stupid idea ? 
  you have a point . 
  the problem i wanted to shine a light upon is that many people who support modern nuclear energy fail to criticize and oppose the `` old '' nuclear energy technology which is still in place today . 
  also , maybe it 's just that i 'm frustrated about the policital fuck-up about nuclear energy in my country for the last few decades . 
  it 's 2014 , where the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asse_ii_mine ) to which i linked in my initial comment states that the nuclear waste barrels in the picture i posted were discarded there between 1967 and 1978 . 
  you 'd think that . 
  back in the 60s and 70s they put all kinds of nuclear and toxic waste in those yellow barrels . 
  500m underground , yes . 
  but many of those barrels are rusty , possibly leaking radioactive materials into ground water . 
  yeah it 's way better than all those dangerous wind turbines . 
  / s i know there are fairly safe and advanced nuclear reactor types available now , but if you 're replacing your old nuclear powerplants anyway , why not just build on truly green energy and not use something that produces nuclear waste that is still dangerous for hundred of thousands of years ? 
  living not too far from [ this ] ( http://db3.stb.s-msn.com/i/65/80766fa57b7c34fc7ed561b8c597.jpg ) ( [ wikipedia article ) , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asse_ii_mine ) the pro-nuclear-energy-circlejerk on reddit is kind of annoying and scary at the same time . 
  edit : grammar, 
  that stereotype is also really hard to lay off because it 's a `` catch 22 '' . 
  if people from other countries joke about germans not having a sense of humor and a german says it 's not true , it just confirms their prejudice because he does n't join them in ` avin ' a giggle over germans not having a sense of humor . 
  and the vicious cycle continues ... 
  i think he was sarcastic . 
  i 'm proud to be an american , where the media is n't influenced by the government at all !, 
  shit , i missed that one . 
  inb4 tom cruise, 
  great grammar there , champ . 
  you 're right . 
  iirc , rolls royce ( and mini ) is owned by bmw , while bentley is part of the volkswagen group . 
  do n't know about aston-martin though . 
  no , i have not . 
  care to give a summary or a link ? 
  unless they 're for rich people , they suck at making cars . 
  : only because the one thing i said was negative , does n't mean i do n't love the uk . 
  it 's insane how much other cities would spend for them to be clean . 
  when i was in downtown london , i could n't find a single trash can , but somehow it was still very clean there . 
  once i 've started to watch almost any movie in english , i have a hard time watching movies in german . 
  it 's just much more atmospherical plus i could n't imagine watching django unchained without leonardo di caprio 's brilliant accent in that movie . 
  quotes from interviewees in a documentary about german arms export : `` but it secures german jobs ! '', 
  `` if we do n't sell , somebody else will anyway ! '', 
  yeah , that 's not how morals work . 
  well there is something called satire . 
  no no , that 's not what i meant . 
  i know plenty about the topic . 
  i wanted to know what / u/xenthe meant with `` does n't know what the stasi actually did '' . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i see . 
  how i understood it is that it 's about monitoring a fraction of traffic between germany and foreign countries , regardless if it 's german citizens or not . 
   your own government is n't probably spying on you [ it is . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20130616-50335.html )  like germany , which i like to believe it 's one of the few countries who actually puts a lot of value on human rights nowadays . 
  the largest outcry about stories like the nsa leak comes from either journalists or politicians in the opposition but the government usually does n't really do anything ( put pressure on the us , etc , ) . 
  but you may still be right that germany is more of a `` troublemaker '' than uk , canada , australia , etc. 
  it does n't matter if you care or not , it 's still a huge invasion in privacy . 
  especially when it 's done in secret by a foreign agency . 
  besides it also violates the right to privacy which is guaranteed to every citizen in the german constitution . 
   it 's only valuable in linking together individuals together and that 's exactly what they do . 
  so a foreign government monitoring and storing information about what people i talk to and when is n't bad ? 
  as if my own government spying on me would n't be bad enough . 
  it 's basically a win/win situation for the government because a ) it lowers the official unemployment rate b ) companies can get incredibly cheap workforce and in turn the politicians are being rewarded for that through lobbyism . 
  our unemployment statistics are being falsified by `` mini-jobs '' etc. 
  anyway .
