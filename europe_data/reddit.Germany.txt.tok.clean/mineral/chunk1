why does n't europe just buy out yahoo and turn into into a better european search engine ? 
  by now yahoo is already powered by bing . 
  well , there was that : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quaero, 
  on what will those 561 million euros be spend ? 
  they certainly wo n't go to mozilla , opera or even apple ... 
   if that is granted , his wife and his children do n't have to risk drowning , they can just board a plane and enter the eu in a regular way . 
  that does make some sense . 
  still i wonder whether staying in syria until then is n't even more dangerous ? 
  as far as op is concerned : i passed an asylum seekers ' hostel today and i saw quite a lot of children ( and men ) . 
  however , there were very few women , though . 
  it is even worse that they think pg tips is a proper tea . 
  well , if you ca n't beat us - join us , maybe ? 
   23 i just found out that this movie has exactly [ 23 reviews on imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126765/reviews?ref_=tt_urv ) scary stuff !, 
   i would n't know what we did without him . 
  health inssurane bismarck-style , perhaps ? 
  how very coincidental that the vw scandal was revealed just yet . 
  tbh i do n't think this is about common sense but your willingness to take risk . 
  lack of transparency allows both parties to play stronger cards and potentially make bigger gains ( but also bigger losses ) transparency , on the other hand , could help tremendously mitigating negative impacts on normal citizens but the gains of the deal will decrease dramatically , too . 
  thus , the question then would be : why have a deal in the first place ? 
  i worry a bit that europe could look at it too short-sighted , though . 
  for example , maybe the us grants us incredibly great things considering the automobile industry and the europeans start raving only to realize much , much later that the automobile industry will loose greatly in importance in the coming years while sillicon valley companies will stay for the next decades and are able to royally milk us now because of some negligibly small admissions that seemed sooo unimportant while drafting the treaty . 
  i dunno ... how about eu ? 
  well nobody stops isps from not being isps anymore . 
  if they feel it is not worth it being an isp then why do n't they take all their money to run a different business ? 
  so basically it 's what soccer feels like for the us . 
  so can we finally buy affordable maple syrup ? 
  nah , i am pretty sure it 's due to these guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9repc, 
   i really do n't care if erdogan or someone from akp calls us nazi . 
  i do n't care in that i do n't feel provoked but i do worry that his statements downlplay the cruelties of nazi germany and may encourage stupid people to attack modern `` nazis '' . 
  in a way it 's even undesirable that they ` defend ' / side with us . 
  just more munition for the `` we vs the west '' people ... 
   i think japan if any would be able to be held to eu standard . 
  absolutely . 
  why stop at trade , though ? 
  let 's invite japan to the eurovision song contest and offer them the chance to join the eu if they manage to win it !, 
  which , btw , should be pretty doable since historically the japanese have proven to be pretty good at both , crazy game shows and karaoke . 
  ok ... now would you kindly do something about the much greater issue of fb shitting on privacy ? 
  like , for example , forbidding the creation of shadow profiles or the upload of address books without the approval of the people behind the entries ? 
  it 's beyond me how governments do n't realise that fb 's rage to collect data on everyone and everything is potentially a real threat to their country . 
   the ride never ends . 
  actually we do have a deadline . 
  it 's the [ 16th of april ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_constitutional_referendum,_2017 ) that 's 33 days left !, 
   new applicants to the eu have to use euro . 
  wonderful !, 
  i think every citizen of the eu will agree with me that euro coins with an unicorn on it need to happen and are exactly what we need in times like these !, 
  * cough * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%bcbler-ross_model#criticism, 
  especially when you ponder on the fact that we 're living in a democracy ... no wonder things like the expansion of fiberglass have such low priority . 
  the e-mail-address for contacting is german but they offer no impressum ???!, 
  you have n't seen trump 's pick for the ambassador to the eu , have you ? 
  however , people of the 52 % are older on average and thus more likely to die before the next election . 
  however , i am pretty sure they wo n't reject brexit . 
  but that does n't really compute . 
  because everyone is fine with their kids being in a relationship with a christian . 
  someone please do the maths : how high is the percentage of german parents who would approve their kid having a relationship with a white christian ? 
   this map is bad , because 49 % is red and 50 % is green . 
  it needs a yellow inbetween . 
  damn i thought i could turn this line into a haiku . 
  but it just does n't work, 
  it 's a play by max frisch , is n't it ? 
  i dunno , i think it highlighs the big city vibe nicely . 
   this is the truth that people do n't want to admit . 
  no , the truth is : no one ( & least of all the pope ) has a clue . 
  `` federation '' or `` union '' are nothing but words . 
  there is no inherent need to comply with any textbook concept . 
  what 's more , not being a classic country gives us a lot of flexibility . 
  we can still speak as one voice when it is in the interest of all eu nations . 
  however , at times it can be more helpful to look like a conglomeration of random nations . 
  having said that , i like the idea of the eu having a federal structure . 
  however , i am of the opinion that it 'll only work if that 's what everyone wants . 
  i am slightly optimistic that this will happen in a distant future out of necessity . 
  we already saw how an event like the election of trump brought us a bit closer . 
  give us 5 more events like this and we 'll get there . 
  it 's utterly necessary to take the time we need to grow together organically . 
  it 's not healthy to ask a 5 y/o kid to stop being a kid . 
  okay , that 's fair enough . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  yes , it is not very accurate but essentially this is what it is about . 
  [ the countries asked are distributed all over the globe ] ( http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2017_country_ratings/participating_countries.gif ) and they probably have not been chosen at random but to represent the global opinion . 
  anyhow , if the mods would like to change the title to something better i am fine with it . 
   i do n't think you should have changed it . 
  i worried the original title ( `` sharp drop in world views of us , uk : global poll '' ) would make this article appear irrelevant to this sub . 
   you have to remember all the `` pretty stuff '' was built at a time where people could n't question how `` their tax money '' was being spent . 
  well , germany recently treated itself to [ this little thingy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elbphilharmonie ) for 789000000 $ ... 
  axis of gay, 
  no , it is not . 
  but she has been the leader of the cdu for quite a while and she failed to bring about a healthy culture in her party . 
  if some of the party 's most hostile figures were part of a fringe party they would have been criticised by journalists lock , stock and barrel . 
  if de maiziere were part of the afd ( and no , i ca n't stand those guys ) his plans for surveillance would have been considered a threat to democracy . 
   she doesn \u00b4 t have any program besides herself really . 
  well , as far as she is concerned that is all right . 
  it 's her party which is so dangerous for this country . 
  things have n't been put on the right track for our future economy and they have no qualms reducing civil rights . 
  yeah , but what mad person would want a single market anyway ... 
  nah , i 'd go with [ occam 's razor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occam%27s_razor ) . 
  `` among competing hypotheses , the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected . '', 
  they 're just too greedy to take negative consequences into account . 
  the fact that theresa may refuses to step down after this debacle just highlights how power hungry she is . 
  they are n't necessarily bad at it . 
  the problem is greed !, 
  in other words , they have a massive problem with their egos .
