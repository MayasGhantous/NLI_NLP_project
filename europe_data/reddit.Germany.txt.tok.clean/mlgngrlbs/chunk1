this has been known for a long time ... 
  it 's just the first time that a minister of defence dared to demand a full report on the readiness of the bundeswehr . 
  i guess in a few days russian experts will find dangerous additives in european wine , which will lead to an immediate ban of the import of said wine ... 
  yeah that 's true - berlin is nice for foreigners as long as you avoid `` true '' berliner ... 
  i like that the article is more differentiated than i expected from the title . 
  it 's true that berlin is very different from the rest of germany - not only in terms of foreigner-friendlieness . 
  germany still struggles with immigrants , due to the failed immigration policies of the past and the fact that german is not an easy language to learn , but essential for the integration into everyday german life . 
  another problem is , that nobody has the feeling , that an actual sincere discussion about immigration is taking place - from the right you get scaremongering and from the left you get reassurances that everything is more or less great . 
  it get 's more covert , when using [ these babies ] ( http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/10/16/worlds-largest-gun-suppressor/ ) , 
  the article mentions the last of the `` 100 things '' of the dhm being the freikorps , that later were the starting cells of the nsdap . 
  allthough its not directly linked to wwii , the dhm certainly tries to show the connection between the two wars . 
  my bet would be a mix of [ unemployment ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/images/map/unemployment/unemployment_map.png ) and far right idiots ... 
  i totally forgot , that i do n't believe it myself !, 
  thank you for your well-thought argument and top-notch contribution to the thread !, 
  is it ? 
  [ i guess northern ireland was invaded by irish buying with euros completely at random in the middle of 2008 ... ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=eur&amp;view=10y ), 
  that was the reason i read in a statement , that i unfortunately ca n't find right now . 
  i guess the statement still holds true if you consider five eyes to be more than a no-spy-treaty . 
  there is no treaty that only forbids spying on each other without an exchange of information . 
  edit : also the question was the official reason - not the real one . 
  from what i 've heard it 's : `` we have never signed such an agreement with any country and we do n't intend to start with this '' basically the fear that other countries will follow and that would among other things harm american companies that [ benefit from the espionage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/echelon#concerns ) . 
  such a great comment , i can understand that you had to post it twice . 
  the consensus seems to be that the soldiers there died for nothing and should n't have been there in the first place . 
  i guess this was caused by unrealistic predictions made at the beginning of the war , the loss of trust in the usa because of the war in iraq and the general problem of sending the bundeswehr into a war despite the constitution saying that it should only be used as a defence force . 
  i see it more as a buffer of influence - the further the influence of western states stretches , the more it poses a threat to the russian model of the `` strong state '' . 
  the possibility `` russian spring '' is a powderkeg that many people want to stop existing , since nobody can predict the consequences ... 
  yes , but after wwi the [ dolchstosslegende ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dolchstosslegende ) was still told , although it was completely false ... 
  i think the comparison to the first world war has some other significance that is rarely mentioned - namely its end with the treaty of versailles . 
  a humiliated loser of a war harbors strong resentment and will try to get revenge once he returned to power . 
  the years after the collapse of the soviet union have been a humiliation for russia and whether directly caused by the western nations or not , they are seen as the primary cause of it . 
  i sometimes get the feeling , that it 's not as much about rebuilding the lost territorial influence as it is about retribution for the first years of the 90s . 
   taking the russian perspective into consideration is not at all the same as agreeing with it . 
  i always get frustrated when persons who try to understand actions get thrown together with persons who try to justify i agree with your last part and think that is the basic reasoning why many germans oppose sanctions/actions that escalate the situation further . 
  no one wants the cold war back , with the exception of the ones that are still stuck in it ... 
  i know for sure zeit published articles taking various differentiated positions in the conflict - ranging from rasmussen to schr\u00f6der . 
  for the poll - there is a difference between advocating neutrality/negotiations and the comments in question - neutrality implies acknowledging that both sides have their problems , the comments are straight up `` russia has done nothing wrong , maidan was the work of western financed terrorists and this article is propaganda payed for by the konrad-adenauer-stiftung '' . 
  i do n't know where you get your news from , but i have read from the beginning about the far right nationalists in the ukranian opposition , about the history of crimea and why the russian actions are understandable and a shit ton of articles why reaching out to russia has its merits compared to scare mongering . 
  however as soon as you look in the comments it 's basically `` russia is great and everyone who says otherwise is an imperialist bastard '' . 
  also on the facebook pages of these newspapers - it 's ridiculous ... 
  i think they are actually succeding and more and more people who care to comment are picking up this rethoric and defend russia against everything : /, 
  we germans are a peace loving people * shifty eyes *, 
  if you refer to anything else than activities of intelligence agencies , then you are [ wrong about germany ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8545772.stm ) . 
  and the new german judiciary minister was slammed for [ refusing to implement this law pending the verdict ] ( http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/january/german-minister-seeks-to-further-delay-implementation-of-eu-data-retention-laws/ ) ... 
  when was the last time germany under merkel had a defined plan for anything ? 
  well someone 's unhappy that the american approach is not regarded as the non-plus-ultra by everybody in germany ... 
  the problem is the so called `` verteidungsfall '' or case of self-defense . 
  this is defined in the constitution as a case of immediate danger for germany and has to be declared by a 2/3 mayority in both chambers of parliament ( can be done retroactively if an actual attack is taking place ) . 
  this declaration has far reaching consequences , one of them is that all elections are put on hiatus while the case is active ... 
  i think it was ammended to the constitution in the 60s , when the only war people could imagine had been wwiii . 
  the verteidungsfall had been regarded as the only time when the bundeswehr would be called to arms - until the involvement in the kosovo conflict and later in afghanistan . 
  now the talk is of `` b\u00fcndnispflicht '' - alliance duty , since of course the verteidungsfall can not be declared since it is only designed for a full scale war . 
  this leads to weird situations for the soldiers - for a long time politicians were saying that afghanistan is no war ( since a war would fall under the verteidigungsfall ) . 
  every foreign mission of the bundeswehr is a grey area at best - constitutionally speaking ... 
  the german army has been slammed in the last years that they still mostly train to fight a conventional war against large amounts of tanks etc. . . for instance basic training is still `` dig yourself a hole in some forest and wait for the enemy to attack in large formations '' and the helicopter squadrons are mainly devised for anti-tank warfare . 
  the bundeswehr is still transitioning to an army that fights outside of the borders ( which in itself is difficult , because constitutionally it is only allowed to fight to defend germany and a whole other amount of legal problems ... ) . 
  the only land that has a `` significant '' movement to break away is bavaria and i use the term significant lightly ... nobody thinks that it will gather enough support anytime soon , but there are of course always problems between the 2 paying l\u00e4nder in germany and the 14 receiving ones ... 
   using one technology that we want to move away from to fund the research and development of alternatives . 
  that 's the problem - industry does not care to develop alternatives for already profitable products . 
  even with the incentive of prioritized access to the grid for renewable energy , german power suppliers chose to play hard and built coal power plants and now they are bitching that those are not profitable . 
  a defined plan to abolish nuclear power puts the providers on the clock to enable future technologies . 
  i think obama has the least to lose here , due to the almost non-existing economic ties between the us and russia ... 
  it looks like the eu and the us are taking the good cop/bad cop approach towards russia . 
  i think the consensus right now is that crimea is `` lost '' to russia ... all this sabre rattling is done to prevent the annexion of the eastern ukraine . 
  the fear is mainly that a state of emergency of some sorts would be declared that would put elections on hold ( which for instance would happen in germany if a `` case of defense '' is declared ) ... 
  i do n't know enough about russian democracy to make qualified statements about this - it 's basically what i think would happen if the situation would develop to a full-fledged cold war . 
  i did not mean to say , that they hate him - sorry if i phrased myself unfortunately there . 
  i meant to say , that there could be sanctions imposed that would seriously harm putins support in russia and if that would be the case i consider him to proud to step down on his own . 
  i think all the outcry for sanctions that actually hurt - as justified as it may be - does underestimate the pride of putin and putins russia . 
  if sanctions were put in place that hurt the oligarchs etc , then a `` caving in '' by putin would naturally be seen as a reaction to the sanctions put in by the west and he would completely lose face . 
  i doubt that he would let that happen - heavy sanctions against russia will cause antagonism to every cause the western countries want to pursue ( iran , syria maybe even north korea ) and possibly cause more territorial aggression to any country between the eu and russia . 
  the russian people would have to endure the sanctions or actually rise up against putin . 
  i do n't know about the power of the oligarchs , but i am very sure that putin himself will not `` cave in '' . 
  i think the eu is considered to be under protection of the nato and i also think that countries like poland will not tolerate an attack on a member of the eu which would at least force the other european states to stand by them . 
  i do n't think there will be a war between russia and the nato , but i also think there will be no russian aggression ( at least territorial ) towards any member of the eu . 
  i do n't have much to back it up , but i got the image that the far right part of the maidan was the most active when it came to fighting and that the breach of the agreement that was negotiated by janukovich and the european foreign ministers present was largely due to the impatience and frustration of the far right movement . 
  therefore i understood the large number of seats in the cabinet as a form of appeasement to keep the opposition from falling even more apart . 
  just a theory and by no means based on good information ... 
  nice to see in absolute values . 
  i recently read that the re-industrialization of russia is almost as dependent on german machinery as the german industry depends on russian gas . 
  thank you for the more trustworthy source - i hate thelocal because 9 out of 10 times it 's just sensationalism ... 
  glen beck used to be an influential host on opinion shows on fox and radio , but he became too nuts even for his tea party audience and subsequently lost all advertising on his shows ... 
  so i would not advise you to take this seriously . 
  i think the reason for the megathread was to get these posts of the frontpage of users subscribed to the defaults/having no account ... 
  there you ca n't filter anything and everyone on the defaults sees shitshows , like the one in the megathread and associates it with / r/europe, 
  thank you for not denying that they are racists : *, 
  why ? 
  racists do n't want to be proven wrong and i do n't want to talk to them - confining them into their own little echochamber seems perfectly reasonable to me ... then again - they seem to be unhappy in / r/european otherwise they would n't have come here ... 
  i 'm from [ dresden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dresden ) . 
  the ( chronologically ) first interesting thing that comes to mind , is that it was almost always the home of the kurf\u00fcrst of saxony . 
  the most important of these dudes was [ august the strong ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustus_ii_the_strong ) who was also king of poland . 
  he was a famous patron of the arts and tried to build his own versailles - the [ zwinger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwinger_%28dresden%29 ) . 
  there would be a lot of history to cover until world war ii , but i 'll skip that ... world war ii means for dresden the [ bombing that destroyed most of the city ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_dresden_in_world_war_ii ) and has been acknowledged by many to have been a simple act of revenge and directly targeted at civilians . 
  after that the city was rebuilt under socialist rule and some buildings in the center of the city still show [ that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plattenbau ) . 
  the [ frauenkirche ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dresden_frauenkirche ) was a ruin and monument to the destruction of the war until it was rebuilt in 2004 . 
  in the gdr dresden was part of the `` tal der ahnungslosen '' - the area where you could not get western tv-reception . 
  after the reunification if germany dresden became the capital of the free state of saxony . 
  the parliament and government of the federal state resides here . 
  the baroque city core has been mostly restored , but is still mixed with some modern buildings . 
  sadly dresden has been a magnet for far right protesters , beginning with neo-nazi marches through the city on the anniversary of the bombings and ending with the pegida demonstrations , that are still going on ... 
  that 's true - i also think the unchecked trust for the american intelligence agencies is the real scandal here .
