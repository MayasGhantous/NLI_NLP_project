  afd rarely misses an opportunity to send their politicians on politcal talk shows , hosted by the exact same broadcasters they are now trying to ban . 
  we would n't hear the end of it if now these broadcasters would stop inviting the afd to their shows , that 's for sure . 
   the cost of the war to the united states was calculated by the us congress to be $ 61.1 billion . 
  [ 210 ] about $ 52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries : $ 36 billion by kuwait , saudi arabia and other arab states of the persian gulf ; $ 16 billion by germany and japan ( which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions ) . 
  about 25 % of saudi arabia 's contribution was paid in the form of in-kind services to the troops , such as food and transportation . 
  [ 210 ] us troops represented about 74 % of the combined force , and the global cost was therefore higher . 
  usa goes to war and others foot the bill . 
  there is no reason to be apologetic about our defense spending . 
  i know quite a few germans personally who do n't understand their country . 
  maybe because they only know the perspective they 've grown up with , within their social bubble etc. 
  and their views may have never been challenged by anything they came in contact with . 
  therefore , i would n't automatically reject the thought that a foreigner may indeed know my country better than i do . 
  [ finally !,

   soros was 13 years old in march 1944 when nazi germany occupied hungary . 
  jewish children were barred from attending school by the nazis , and soros and the other schoolchildren were made to report to the judenrat ( `` jewish council '' ) which had been established during the occupation . 
  soros later described this time to writer michael lewis : `` the jewish council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices . 
  i was told to go to the jewish council . 
  and there i was given these small slips of paper ... 
  i took this piece of paper to my father . 
  he instantly recognized it . 
  this was a list of hungarian jewish lawyers . 
  he said , `` you deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported . '', 
  and you spin the story of a barely teenaged boy into one of a nazi-collaborator ... 
  it 's a billion dollar business across the eu , with a substantial part of the money earned going to morocco for example . 
  coming to an agreement with these countries is n't just in germany 's interest , it 's in the interest of all countries in the eu . 
  i 'm not saying legalizing or cracking down on hashish is the solution , but it wo n't hurt to consider it and include it somehow into our strategy . 
  i mostly wanted to show that we do n't have to be toothless . 
  we can find something they care about , and find solutions that , preferably , wo n't hit us harder than what it 's worth . 
  we could also legalize marihuana . 
  that might hurt morocco more . 
  \\ ^_^ [ in 2003 , 70 % of europe 's hashish consumed was produced in morocco ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cannabis_in_morocco ) . 
  i 'd like to see a movie about the events of this specific evening . 
  might want to call it `` the hungarian girl '' , an instant cult classic of european cinema . 
  it could be romania 's `` trainspotting '' , and hungary 's `` smolensk '' . 
  on new year 's eve , a group of adolescents embarks on a journey to discover the unlimited wonderlands of adult relationships and , with the help of a beautiful stranded girl , learns an unexpected lesson : a gangbang is not fun if you are the one getting fucked . 
   the same way zizek said trump is better than clinton because it might lead to a much needed change a forest fire might be good because it kills off the bug infestation . 
  but it also might burn the whole fucking forest down . 
  huge fires and movements have this in common , they easily spiral out of control . 
  therefore we should be careful what we wish for . 
  that 's why people say we need to come down on these countries with the full weight of the eu . 
  for the ways of man are before the eyes of the lord , and he pondereth all his goings . 
  * proverbs 5:21 *, 
  this is n't even about morals , it is about solving a problem . 
  hungary and greece had a refugee problem , not germany . 
  but since they were neither willing nor able to solve it , germany stepped in . 
  you are just parroting the usual uninformed garbage . 
  in hindsight , i indeed wonder if we should n't have opened the valve and relieve hungary of the pressure . 
  if there would n't have been actually people involved in this whole affair , it would have been a far better option to shut down the border and watch how hungary handles the refugees within . 
  leaning back and just calling out hungary for all the different breaches of contract that already had occured and , without a doubt , would continue to occur , would have been way easier than actually trying to do something and help . 
  it is nonetheless interesting to see the different reactions the handling of the crisis has spurred . 
  what astonishes me to some degree is , how orban got away with it . 
  nobody talks about him and his thuggish actions anymore . 
  we are not talking about how and where schengen and dublin failed , but rather about how germany failed . 
  btw , the malicious comments thrown in from the sideline also contribute to at least my perception of eastern europeans . 
  `` selfish '' is n't the exact impression i got from some noteworthy individuals here , that would be way too mild . 
   so yeah , this is what french people proud of their roots have to deal with in the core of france nowadays . 
  sorry your poor soul has to suffer through this pun . 
  the nerve of some people , incredible !, 
  but on a more serious note : can you actually read what you wrote with a straight face ? 
  they 'd have to take you seriously to be offended . 
  do n't worry , your edginess will wear off , give it some time . 
  just because both are black ? 
  [ tagesschau ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/suche-tatverdaechtiger-103.html ) seems to have all relevant pieces . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnuxerywt1w it 's apparantly not a button to push . 
  to be also fair , i would have argued that if a politician wants to get anything done in his party 's / country 's / lobby 's interest , he needs to be competent . 
  the politician needs to know the matter , the procedures , the inoffical rules etc. 
  with the increasing importance of eu legislation , parties realised they 'd have to send competent folks there if they do n't wan na lose ground against other interests . 
  but of course , that whole premise has no use when it is applied on someone who just wants to leave the whole thing . 
  does n't make sense to send someone who knows how to use a bathroom if all that is expected from him is to shit on the table . 
  depends ... 
  both exist , and more . 
  if spinning a wheel or a little cross is involved , it is usually a `` ventil '' , `` h\u00e4hne '' are often operated with a single lever . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.parkerstore-shop.org/auslaufventil1-21.jpg ) is officially named `` auslaufventil '' , but most people probably refer to it as `` wasserhahn '' . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ikz.de/ikz-praxis-archiv/p0209/020903.php ) is a description about how the distinction is actually made . 
  sorry for the german source . 
  just to be a smartass : technically , a cock is not a valve , tho it 's commonly used as a synonym . 
  a cock is meant to be operated in an open/close manner . 
  a valve regulates flow . 
  at least that is the distinction we make in germany . 
  best i can do is : if she catches you looking into her raute , she is legally allowed to slap you once . 
  okay . 
  the overall impression europeans get from these and many more single incidents , rulings etc and us politics in general is , that business , to not say corporate greed , usually triumphs over all other concerns , no matter if the concerns are about environment , health or society . 
  the days when second class politicians were sent off to brussels just to get rid of them are imo gone . 
  might be rooted in the christian faith . 
  especially catholics have a long tradition of being cross with jews . 
  you have already presented two ways to solve unemployment . 
   adding to solution one , i think we are already on the way . 
  does n't matter if it happens unintentionally or `` steered '' . 
  the decline in population across europe could spare us from other means in order to curb the problem . 
  but globally , it is a even bigger beast . 
  looks like unemployment is the real bane of our time . 
  solving this would most likely also eliminate many other concerns . 
  well , if that is what makes you happy , yo #re probably going to have a bad time in europe . 
  that 's what i was assuming , something bigger is going on , like a concert as you said . 
  the central place does n't seem to be occupied by booths , and i was wondering what the reason might be . 
  here is one from the [ n\u00fcrnberger christkindlesmarkt ] ( http://www.br.de/franken/inhalt/kultur/2013-christkindlesmarkt-nuernberg-136~_v-img__16__9__xl_-d31c35f8186ebeb80b0cd843a7c267a0e0c81647.jpg?version=9879e ) . 
  looks like the place to gather is arranged outside the booth circuit . 
  not that it matters much i guess , tho . 
  that looks really crowded .
