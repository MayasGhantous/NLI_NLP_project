   technically you want to supply money to the country that threatens the eastern europe but buying gas from russia would n't be a problem if it has to flow through ukraine and some people could continue to cash in on the transfer fees ? 
  what guarantees does germany have that ukraine wo n't use the pipeline as leverage again ? 
  ok , but please be gentle and tell us what to do . 
  the last time has been confusing and we lack experience . 
  the un , the eu . 
  libya for all i care if they manage to do so . 
  we do n't need to make a fuss over `` camps '' . 
  meanwhile , there are plenty camps within the eu . 
  almost every city and village in germany is using container blocks . 
  if containers are a suitable way to accommodate people in germany , i do n't see how that would be out of place outside the eu ? 
   also will they be able to apply for asylum in those camps ? 
  that would be the idea , no ? 
  embassies were never meant to handle these high numbers . 
  dealing with applications has never been their main purpose . 
  because a government can be `` coerced '' . 
  they need international backing , financial aid , trade partners . 
  the only push towards exterritorial camps i 've heard of came from austria . 
  baffling silence from everybody else . 
   please tell me that 's still a thing . 
  it 's a thing if we make it a thing . 
  [ prepare your beard !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/q6phztgeyog?t=34s ), 
  everything is done in accordance with international law . 
  that basically means without cooperation from the un we ca n't do much , if we do n't want to go rogue . 
  i would have hoped by having ant\u00f3nio guterres as general secretary to the un , who is a ) a european and b ) has a background as high commissioner for refugees , this issue would be treated with a higher priority and a real solution would be presented instead of just keeping to tell us to take them in . 
  a un-resolution to establish a migrant centre in libya that would also allow for the return transport of arrivals at the eu borders would be a start . 
  depending on who we ask , libya either has a functioning government or it does n't , so i do n't see how this can be a serious obstacle . 
  if we have to build a city there , so be it . 
  if the un wo n't move , i 'd consider requesting a letter of marque . 
  the way i see it is , the eu has no advantages from having to deal with two seperate states instead of just spain , but only problems . 
  the headaches already start with having to have a stance on this issue and the possible precedent it would establish . 
  siding with spain antagonizes the catalans , and vice versa . 
  it 's a lose-lose situation for the eu , no matter its stance or outcome . 
  and who knows which other regions may get some fancy ideas a few years down the road . 
  saying both the eu and spain want catalonia as part of the eu is a bit dishonest . 
  of course they want catalonia , but preferably as a region of spain . 
  having to deal with two seperate states instead of just spain just complicates procedures even more . 
  it would basically mean having to shoulder the increased bureaucracy ( and costs ) any additional member naturally comes with , but without actually adding anything to the portfolio . 
  finding common ground with even more members will become more diffult . 
  basically , every argument that can be made against further enlarging the eu can be applied , but none of the advantages actual new members bring to the table . 
  keep in mind , we 're not talking about accepting an independet catalonia into the eu yet . 
  just exploring the reasons why the eu or any of its member states would be in favor of a secession or even support it . 
  the case you make by saying catalans are by majority pro-eu can be disregarded , as much as it pains me to say this . 
  we 've seen support for the eu rise and fall for various reasons . 
  and we have no crystal ball to look into the future , to know what will happen once the goal of independence is achieved . 
  finances : by mentioning reason no 1 you actually just shot yourself in the foot . 
  what a secession from spain actually would mean for the eu and the member states is this : catalonia is trying to unload its burden onto the eu . 
  if there is a need in the other regions of spain for the financial transfers , then that need wo n't disappear magically . 
  it just would n't be fulfilled by catalonia , presumably . 
  that 's really hard to sell . 
  in this very post , you are lobbying for an agency to move to barcelona . 
  how about we force those filthy-rich eu bureaucrats working for this agency to use their spending power in a region more in need of a boost than the already overcrowded barcelona ? 
  in the long term , this might help in reducing the burden of the financial transfer . 
  not further increasing rent and living costs in and around the city might also be a side effect . 
  so far we still presumed that the economic performance of catalonia will stay the same . 
  but who knows how your region will keep performing after a secession ? 
  the debt is a big issue , and how companies would react is , at least to me , mostly a guessing game so far . 
  from the outside , as long as catalonia is part of spain , the situation is under way more control . 
  / u/rainymeadow laid out the applicable law for you . 
  yet you remained optimistic about the eu being pragmatic and maybe allowing for quick transition . 
  maybe you are right , maybe the eu would do that . 
  what i 've tried to describe here are just some pragmatic considerations from what i assumed could be the perspective of the eu . 
  you might find that seceding from spain and joining the eu under these circumstances could be in many ways considered as starting off on the wrong foot , to say the least . 
  well , i 'm neither a prophet nor an expert , of course my guesswork could be way off . 
  i hope you keep your faith in the eu and catalonia anyways , and maybe even find some for spain . 
  and we are n't even through with enlightenment . 
  if i look at how many prinicples and achievments are now questioned again from within our european societies , i wonder if we are en route to having a need for getting them enforced top down . 
  subjects of god 's mercy . 
  aryan brootherhood works in a similar way when it comes to recruiting . 
  since most members are already locked up for a long time , their activities are usually restrained to prisons . 
  does n't mean these guys have more respect for a human life than your average islamic terrorist tho .
