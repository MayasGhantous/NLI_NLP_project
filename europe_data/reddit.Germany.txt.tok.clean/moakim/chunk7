  [ all these years civilization has never been able to make it past the borders . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5qlsc6w.png ) who 's next to try and tame the belgians ? 
  the new troika looks even scarier : human rights watch , reporters sans fronti\u00e8res and amnesty international . 
  maybe because it 's an [ aquired taste ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acquired_taste ) ? 
  i like meat and sausages . 
  but the mindset of people enjoying a free buffet at a symposium and then complaining about  belgian endives with caramelised apple , celery escalope with honeyed carrots and a soya vegetable lasagne ... is kinda infuriating . 
  that 's a dangerous attitude . 
  at some point , people should ask themselves if this is still the same country , the spirit and the values they had in mind and are used to , or if something has changed or is changing . 
  some people have a hard time understanding and accepting the model of a successful welfare state . 
  others perceive such a state even as a threat , since the population might get the `` wrong '' ideas from it . 
  brilliant strategy to employ multiple athens . 
  odysseus would be proud . 
  we tried to incorportate italian design into some of our products . 
  not sure what to do with the [ results ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/colani_bierglas.jpg ) tho . 
  you are not supposed to export the heads , silly . 
  only what is [ in the heads ] ( https://www.berevita.com/resizer/600/32022_2232848.jpg/large-finlandia-cranberry-finnish-vodka-1-l-1.jpg ) !, 
  the libanese here are not from a `` refugee crisis '' . 
  the last major crisis has been from the balkan wars , and the claim `` look at previous refugee crisis , the majority of people will stay in europe '' does n't really hold up . 
  and it is imo a valid comparison when it comes to syrians . 
  their return will most likely depend on the outcome of the war and is also tied to assad 's fate . 
  for migrants from lybia , afaik only 10 % have a legitimate claim for asylum . 
  some problematic groups remain , like somalis with a much higher quota . 
  they indeed are more likely to stay here . 
  out of 350.000 bosnian refugees , less than 20.000 remained in germany due to `` h\u00e4rtefallregelung '' . 
  would n't that become a problem for other eu-armies ? 
  their potential soldiers might just sign up for the higher wages in germany instead of joining their army at home ,, 
  heads ? 
  the one creating something from wood usually makes more money than the one just selling it . 
  it 's the same for all other ressources . 
  does n't matter much if you have the ressources at home or need to buy them . 
  what natural resources does germany have ? 
  brown coal ? 
  they are free to do so , as long as it is not in conflict with other rights . 
  i see a difference between having to wear a headscarf , a face cover , or having to cut off your little finger to appear modest . 
  different practical challenges , as well as different risks for potential abuse . 
  the issue of promoting a certain form of a religious belief has n't been brought up by the government , probably because the main argument for the plan seems to be based on `` practical reasons '' , rather than reaching for other arguments that may even justify a full ban . 
  so what ? 
  ca n't adress one issue as long as that other issue exist ? 
  i 'm sure they did n't forget about it , but apparantly that issue does n't have a high priority . 
   is there even a single incident where this was relevant ? 
  it is when people actually talk to each other . 
   pretty ignorant this think this ban has nothing to do with hatred against muslims . 
  it may have to do with prejudices , for some people . 
  since it only affects face covers and no other islamic clothes , like a headscarf , it wo n't do much for people hating on muslims . 
  i 'm pretty sure these people will continue with their hate . 
  which jewish outfits do you consider problematic ? 
  i ca n't think of any . 
  they would never see it [ coming ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/hitman/images/3/38/461952_10150949954588987_40169534_o.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120530195559 ) !, 
  it has purpose . 
  in government workplaces , wearing a face cover would signal a belief that is not in line with the constitution , e.g. 
  equality laws . 
  in schools and universities , where communication is essential , communicating through a face cover is a hindrance . 
  it 's like a talking through a wall . 
  driving with a face cover makes identifying the driver impossible . 
  keep in mind , this is not about banning a veil , it 's not even banning full face covers from public . 
  saying it 's a `` fuck you '' to muslims is simply wrong , because wearing a face cover is not a requirement for being a muslim . 
  because it 's about covering the face , not just the head . 
  i also would n't call these parts of the left `` pro-russia '' per se , although such a group probably exists as well . 
  but due to their convictions , e.g. 
  anti-capitalist / anti-nato , they find themselves sometimes in strange company . 
  the left is n't a monolithic block , so opinions may differ . 
  but lets not go there . 
  why not quote the complete sentence ? 
   terrorism is a significant problem for our police , intelligence services and politicians . 
  i do n't know where you got the impression from that our security authorities would n't be occupied , to say the least , with such threats . 
  the article you linked has nothing to do with this assessment , especially since i already adressed this with  the population does n't need to panic about it , [ ... ], 
  apparently , the message from the crowd there seems to be akin to `` we love/support the eu '' , and from this specific picture `` netherlands , , we love you '' . 
  i hope that answers your question . 
   though germany in particular is still better off in this respect than many other countries that depends on with what other countries germany is compared . 
  your statement is definitely not true in a comparison with other eurozone countries . 
  https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/germanys-wide-rich-poor-gap-477017  also terrorism has n't been a real significant problem in germany since the end of the 2nd generation raf in the 80s . 
  forgetting about the nsu and is ? 
  terrorism is a significant problem for our police , intelligence services and politicians . 
  the population does n't need to panic about it , but acknowledging it should n't be asked too much . 
  the message sent from the demonstration was clear . 
  i do n't know what is there to argue about . 
  it certainly does n't say `` we did a representative survey and the result is shown in the picture '' . 
  i , too , know who i would call for sax !, 
  the anti-capitalistic , anti-nato left does n't seem to have a problem defending russia 's actions in ukraine . 
  putin 's russia offers enough stuff to pick and choose for all extreme likings . 
  got ta love our exotic culinary kinks . 
  #toasthawaii #pizzaleberk\u00e4s, 
  stop complaining . 
  we westerners get your old horses served in our lasagna . 
  we all should be grateful it 's not soylent green , yet . 
  well , given her positions on other topics than immigration , i hope her voters are aware of what they are buying . 
   the only thing i take away from this conversation is that you seem to be fine with the world being in the hands of bullies . 
   correct . 
  and this adds enough weight to your arguments to sink them . 
  maybe not in russia , but ok , ca n't have everything . 
  could have saved me some time if you came out with this earlier , instead of making up bs arguments . 
  i do n't know . 
  what was the point of your last comment ? 
  sanctions are imposed right now . 
  the only thing i take away from this conversation is that you seem to be fine with the world being in the hands of bullies . 
  russia seems to be bothered by them . 
  why else would they want to see them gone ? 
  and sanctions are for those who ignore them . 
  in this case , russia 's interests would have to stop at ukraine 's border . 
  unfortunately , bullies do n't have much regard for international law .
