  it 's almost as if her supporters think it 's not corruption when it 's their party taking the money . 
  that is the funny thing about `` anti-globalists '' routing for trump : they seem to be perfectly fine with trump and his cabinet picks being globalists and singing the praise for economic liberalism . 
  true heroes of the working class . 
   what is shady about it ? 
  you do n't think those are legitimate concerns ? 
  that depends to whom these are concerns . 
  to kiev and to those supporting kiev , this affair looks way different . 
  kiev 's concerns about traitors escaping to russia are apparantly different from russia 's ... and what is shady about it ? 
  rebels and traitors , pretty shady characters trying to escape . 
  and that is just a side-effect . 
  the real issue is still russia acting against the interests and the will of ukraine by recognizing the passports . 
  i 'm aware it can be troubling , as can be living in a warzone . 
  who exactly would have to fear torture or imprisonment tho ? 
  separatists , rebels , traitors ? 
  these are the shady answers , i guess . 
  on the ukraininian border ? 
  let 's assume someone does n't have a passport and wants to travel , why , if he ca n't get it from lugansk or donetsk , would n't this person go to ( nearest ukraininian city ) and get one there ? 
  can look at it any way , we 're only left with some really shady answers under the guise of `` helping those fleeing the warzone '' . 
  what makes you think ukrainians do n't have ukraininian passports ? 
  even if some of them for whatever reason do n't have one , how about birth certificates or other documents ? 
  for sure that 's enough to escape the warzone . 
  who would stop them from crossing the border ? 
  i 'm sure it would please the humanitarian in you even more if the rebels in eastern ukraine would just stop fighting . 
  besides that , why would an ukrainian passport keep anyone from fleeing the region ? 
  why would there be a need for a passport issued by the rebels ? 
  plenty of people fled from the war , towards the west and even into russia , back when there were n't any new passports . 
  to defend this act by russia , a better reason than painting this as an `` humanitarian '' one would be needed , and for you to sound believable , you 'd need to eat way more chalk . 
   i still do n't know what it violates in the minsk agreements . 
  what 's the point of trying to distort what was actually said ? 
  should stick with the words already provided by the text :  [ ... ] ** undermines ** the unity of ukraine [ ... ] ** contradicts ** everything that was agreed in minsk, 
  i 'm really not sure if i should be ok with the stuff you guys learn from paradox . 
  most german news outlets have correspondants in the usa . 
  they do n't need to rely on cnn or fox . 
  `` any grownup should agree with me ! '', 
  his lies ? 
  the constant effort to undermine and circumvent not only the media , but also the judiciary ? 
  the total disregard of foreign relations that have been in place for decades ? 
  his uninformed takes on the state of the world and the us ? 
  just to name a few . 
  of course , there are people who agree with him and like him especially for the things he does and maybe they do n't care about these issues at all . 
  others do . 
  i guess cartoons from the us are watched world-wide , so they are what connects europeans to americans and probably asians , m-easterners and africans , but they are not exclusive to europeans . 
  countercheck : how many americans know pan tau , krte\u010dek or nils holgerson ? 
  some stuff may have made it across the pond , but i guess the majority is widely unknown . 
  good luck with that . 
  when i 'll get my pacemaker and the hip replacements , i will become invincible !, 
  immortality , embrace me !, 
  ... you grew up with cartoons and series from czechoslovakia , poland , spain , finland , france , germany , italy , ... , and of course , japan . 
  there are limits to what qe can achieve and for how long it will be upheld . 
  afaik there has recently been an anouncement about when it is supposed to end . 
  what then ? 
  it is , but then good luck finding another lender with somewhat reasonable terms , 
  if i have debts and then just print money and pay my debt with it , what worth will that money be to my debtors ? 
  what do they get for it , besides some colored paper ? 
  if i remember correctly , everything that has been done happend under a lot of pressure and with some sense of impending doom . 
  `` if it continues like this , greece will run out of liquidity in two weeks '' , and such statements usually turned into a countdown where in the last 3 to 1 days some solution or compromise was found . 
  that does n't make it better , but maybe somewhat understandable . 
  are you sure he is not amassing an army ? 
  how are these refugees meant to pay for their stay if not through conquest ? 
  rule 1 of shakira law : hips shall not lie !, 
   but global hypereducated elites of course , a pedestrian might also call any car owner `` hypermobilized '' . 
  i 've only read about him backpedaling on electoral reform promises . 
  i 'm not really up to date with canadian politics , sorry . 
  just commented on the part with the obama reference . 
  concede to what ? 
   belgium is different but same in high level of public debt . 
   missing the point which is that high debt level is not the problem . 
  are you kidding ? 
  can you please stop acting all offended by some comparison ? 
   the greek economy is like any other economy . 
  no , it is not . 
  every economy has it 's own grown structures , problems , dependencies . 
  unfortunately , all economies still have to follow the same basic global rules . 
   you haircut the debt , or extend the time needed to pay it back , and you reduce the imposition of austerity . 
  that has already happend and most likely will happen again . 
  and without structural reforms , it most likely will achieve the same results . 
   much easier to moralise about northern europeans being doctors and everyone else patients . 
  pointing out a problem is moralising , but trying to guilt trip other countries into paying somehow is n't ? 
  please ... 
   it ended up helping whole ez and therefore helped greece ? 
  if i would have said that anything helping germany also helps the ez , would you have jumped onto me ? 
   belgium was almost as much in debt as greece . 
  surprise , belgium is n't greece !, 
  you are comparing apples with oranges here . 
  [ this article ] ( https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/08/20/2137566/whats-the-deal-with-belgium/ ) highlights some fundamental differences . 
  quick edit because paywall : not quoting the whole article , just a few listed differences . 
   third , belgium 's long history of current account surpluses and attendant capital outflows means that the country has accumulated significant claims on the rest of the world  fourth , belgium is a major trading nation that plays a big role in the supply chains of german high-end manufacturing firms , which have done relatively well . 
  that 's the question . 
  did it get worse because of the measures , or did the measures simply were applied too late to save the patient ? 
   it 's just relying on nato and the eu . 
  do n't we all rely somehow on nato and eu ? 
  i mean , that 's kinda the point of an alliance . 
  instead of every single country having to match russia 's military spending , we pool our ressources and help each other . 
  that makes us smart . 
  and we have to be smart . 
  of course , circumstances might change , and then everyone will have to adapt . 
  right . 
  shows you the strength of the eurozone . 
  what has qe done for greece ? 
  where did the money end up ?
