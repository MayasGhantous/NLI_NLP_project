  but ultra religious conservatism which might manifest itself as the full face veil should not be countered by victimizing the woman . 
  moreover , the woman who was attacked in the train was not an `` invisible '' woman . 
  she was wearing a headscarf not a face veil and her face was visible . 
  so it 's not me who needs to learn about the world , but you who needs to google hijab , niqab , purdah , chador , abaya and burqa in order to learn some nuance . 
  wearing a headscarf is not an `` islamist '' symbol . 
  anyone can wear a headscarf , from a muslim woman to a christian grandma to a nun . 
  you 're still a bigot for not wanting to help an innocent person based on their looks and their clothes . 
  your example is pretty ridiculous , nazis getting harassed on the train ? 
  ah yes , those poor nazis . 
  somebody think about them please !, 
  laughable . 
  let 's see , on one side we have a woman who is trying to mind her own business while riding the train . 
  on the other , we have a group of racist thugs who are harassing her and spraying alcohol all over her . 
  yeah , i do n't see the equivilance . 
  wearing a headscarf is a choice and a freedom guaranteed under freedom of expression and religion . 
  harassment , on the other hand , is a fucking crime . 
  if you would really hesitate to help a woman in a headscarf ( which might as well be a nun ) because of the way she looks , i 'm sorry to say but you 're an incredibly prejudiced person . 
  muslims throwing acid in london ? 
  that 's a thing !? 
  the only one i know about is the katie piper incident but her not a muslim ex boyfriend was the culprit . 
  a lot of the arson attacks and other vandalism happen on * planned * homes for asylum seekers that are often under construction . 
  there is no one living there so it 's not accurate to say that inhabitants are setting commiting arson most of the time . 
  in fact , the list you have shown includes a lot of cases which are just regular cases of fire breaking out , this category is seperate from `` absichtliche brandstiftung '' or delebrate arson . 
  i think it should be pretty clear that the majority of arson * attacks * ( and not just cases of fire breaking out ) have been from neo nazis . 
  the german interior minister says as much , in the bbc article :  german interior minister thomas de maiziere called such violence `` shameful '' . 
  ** two-thirds of the attacks were carried out by locals ** who had no previous criminal record , he said . 
  also , i would n't necessarily put much faith in a document like the one you have linked . 
  it clearly stems from biased sources , especially because it is talking about `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' and linking to twitter pages like homofurst . 
  i am an immigrant myself and i am opposed to mass uncontrolled immigration . 
  i also happen to think pegida is a bunch of nutters . 
  so it really is important to distinguish people who have some reservations regarding immigration from people who are bigoted and think pi-news is more objective and reliable than faz . 
  [ 500 attacks and arsons on asylum homes ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34487562 ) this year alone disagree . 
  interesting proposition , i would have to watch this documentary to make a conclusion about it but as far as i know , criminology is far more complex than just prevailing cultural norms and socioeconomics play an extremely important role here too . 
  the united states for instance is also part of the west but they have an extremely high rate of homocide per capita than any other country in the first world . 
  and rioting and civil disobedience , such as those that happened in stockholm and london which could be assumed to be dominated by immigrant youth happen in [ poland ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/nationalist-riots-at-poland-independence-day-celebrations-in-warsaw/a-18057250 ) and [ germany ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/football-fans-neo-nazis-riot-cologne ) as well , dominated by natives . 
  so i would suggest that europe 's relatively low crime rate is not because of western culture but because of economic prosperity and abundance of social services for the poor . 
  even if you look at non-western countries like saudi arabia , oman , qatar and uae who are economically extremely well off , we see the same pattern of low crime and homicide rate . 
  so i would argue it 's not cultural and has more to do with economics . 
  that 's absolutely true . 
  that is the reason why i am against populism , because it seeks to manipulate people and use their most basic instincts against them , be they fears , worries , hopes and even empathy ( as was the case with refugee crisis ) . 
  it 's subtle brainwashing to tell you the truth . 
  i do n't think it is a cultural thing to pelt ambulances and fire brigades that are trying to help you with stones and rocks . 
  degenerates and criminal behaviour that could have been triggered as part of a protest in the context of a riot , yes , but it 's not cultural and you wo n't hear anyone justify this . 
  populism is not a political alignment or an established ideology . 
  it is a set of methods used to appeal to the masses , and these methods are often morally bankrupt and disingenuous . 
  my issue with populism is that it seeks to actively misinform and manipulate the public for political gain . 
  this is true for leftist parties as well as parties on the right . 
  not really . 
  many political parties flirt with populism , that much at least is true . 
  and that is the case with not only right wing parties but also the left wing , such as syriza in greece and podemos in spain . 
  the main problem with populism is that it rejects the legitimacy of political opponents . 
  as the populists are supposed to be the voice of all the people , anyone with a different view speaks for `` special interests '' , i.e. 
  the elite . 
  given that the key distinction is between the pure people and the corrupt elite , any compromise would lead to the corruption of the people and is therefore rejected . 
  this uncompromising stand and black and white views leads to a polarised political culture , in which non-populists turn into anti-populists . 
  this is the absolute antithesis of democratic culture in a liberal democracy . 
  we see such majoritarian extremism manifest itself in countries like venezuela and hungary . 
  populism is deplorable as far as i 'm concerned . 
  it propogates itself in the political space created by fears and the worries of the common man and tries to establish itself as the primary force for change , betterment and the way to get rid of the status quo . 
  it always exploits situtations and events for political gains , often by spreading half-truths and misinformation and relying on yellow journalism . 
  it creates scrapegoats and legitimizes itself through the alleged incapabilty of the `` old party mafia '' that has forefully taken control of a nation . 
  populist parties try to sell themselves as the sole representatives of the people , by promoting the idea that the `` old parties '' and the `` elites '' have betrayed and neglected the public and the common man at large . 
  to me , this quote by isaac asmiov perfectly describes populism : `` anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life , nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ` my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge . '', 
  you forgot this :  the report shows that , of 131 individuals charged with the 152 rapes in which the perpetrator could be identified , 45.8 % were of african , middle eastern or asian origin while 54.2 % were of norwegian , other european or american origin . 
  in the cases of `` assault rape '' , i.e. 
  rape aggravated by physical violence , a category that included ** 6 of the 152 cases ** and 5 of the 131 identified individuals , the 5 identified individuals were of african , middle eastern or asian origin things you did n't understand because you are blinded by agenda : - assault rape ( rape by a stranger ) is only one form of rape . 
  most rapes are committed by people who already know the victim personally such as husbands and boyfriends . 
  - there were ** 6 assault rapes in 3 years ** ( 2007 , 2008 and 2009 ) in oslo , out of a total of 152 registered cases of all types of sexual violence . 
  5 rapists in the assault rape category were identified . 
  - all of these 5 rapists had a foreign origin . 
  i do n't think this equals to `` rape epidemic '' or `` rape wave '' at all as you seem to be suggesting . 
  generalising millions of people and judging them by the actions of criminals is even more absurd . 
  so while it 's true that `` all assault rapes were committed by africans or asians '' you have to keep in persepective that we are talking about 5 cases in 3 years . 
  the way this statement has been taken out of context and politicized is kinda ridiculous , suddenly you have people posting `` 100 % of all rapists in norway are muslims '' and people buy into this crap even if it 's not true in the slightest . 
  moreover , if you are a fan of the oslo police department and would take them at their word ( like you seem to be doing in your comment ) you would also believe them when they say :  the majority of registered perpetrators in cases of reported rape in oslo in 2010 have norwegian citizenship , as has been the case in every previous rape study . 
  in 2010 this went for 61.2 % of the perpetrators , which is relatively stable compared to the material from 2007 ( 60.3 % ) . 
  a relatively high proportion , 12.5 % , of the registered perpetrators are from other parts of europe , and taken together almost three quarters of the perpetrators in 2010 have european citizenship . 
  for the rest , 10.5 % are from africa , 9.2 % from the middle east , 4.6 % from asia and 2 % from america . 
  or when they say this :  crude generalizations that have given the impression that rapists are only foreigners are shown to be inadequate and erroneous . 
  here are my sources : [ 88 page study by the oslo police district ] ( https://www.politi.no/oslo/aktuelt/nyhetsarkiv/2011_05/nyhet_9976.xml ) [ translation of relevant pages in english ] ( http://de.scribd.com/doc/76695373/excerpt-from-oslo-police-district-report-on-rape ) . 
  the syrian civil war has been caused by fanaticism and is also basically a proxy war between iran/russia/syria on one side and u.s. / saudi/israel on the other side . 
  western foreign policy has been a complete disaster . 
  but that is a complex matter to discuss . 
  for now , you can be sure that those who are n't from war torn lands ( like syria and iraq ) and are merely in europe to improve their economic condition ( from the balkans for example ) will be deported as soon as possible . 
  according to bamf , germany has an [ average rate of 28,4 % ] ( https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/infografik_2737_entscheidungen_ueber_asylantraege_in_deutschland_n.jpg ) of asylum seekers from all countries to accept them as legitimate refugees and grant them legal stay . 
  the others are principially rejected , but they have the right to appeal and the process takes longer before they can get deported . 
  so the processing system definitely needs to improve and become a lot more efficient . 
  first of all , this figure of 1.5 million is not yet verified by german authorities , it is a report by the german tabloid `` bild '' who claim to have somehow gotten `` secret documents '' . 
  i do n't know how true it is , so i am sceptical . 
  second of all , even if 1.5 million refugees are coming to germany , i consider it a good thing because it will finally lead to some improvement in the asylum application processing system which is horrendeously slow and flawed . 
  if a system needs to be tested , the best way to do it is to overload it . 
  if it is not capable of handling the load , it means that the system is broken ( which we all know it is ) and in urgent need of repair so the way i see it , this issue will become more and more politicized with the number of increasing migrants and the eu will hopefully be forced to devise a coherent strategy on how to deal with the problem . 
  my suggestions would the following , firstly to employ a lot more people working for refugee registration authorities so deportations of people who have no claim can be even more faster . 
  secondly to devise a foreign policy towards the syrian civil war so that people in that country are n't forced to flee for their lives . 
  and finally to improve economic conditions in poorer eastern european countries like serbia , albania , kosovo , macadonia etc. 
  because most refugees are economic migrants from these countries . 
  only if their economies are improved will their incentive to immigrate to find better jobs become any lower . 
  many a times , economic migrants sell everything in their home countries to come to western europe , only to find out that they will be deported back because they have no claim to asylum . 
  this is a major shitty situation for them , and this needs to be made clear too through a press campaign that illegal economic migrants will never be able to obtain legal status in any western country . 
  over the next ten years ?
