  if that were true , they would be riding camels instead of airplanes , cars and trains . 
  so perhaps entertain the possibilty that you have a lot of misconceptions about modern muslims and ask them yourself what they think of issues like domestic violence , child marriage and so on . 
  maybe you 'll find that you 're not that different to them after all . 
  i find it hard to believe that muslims who have daughters themselves today and are living in the 21st century would be willing to marry them off at the age of 6 or whatever . 
  sure it happens , but only because of ignorance and illiteracy and so the frequency with which it happens represents a small percentage of the world wide population of 1.5 billion people . 
  did n't you just say that you were n't against people , just against religion ? 
  are n't muslims people too ? 
  again , flawed logic . 
  neither does the quran actually . 
  and you are very much against muslims because you are hell bent on offending them . 
  i 'm not a religious person but even i would classify a person who 's wearing [ this shirt ] ( http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2015/media/200810/_original/1435251427/1035x444-jesus_tees.jpg ) for example as an intolerant asshole with a childish mentality becuase they are needlessly offending millions . 
  i absolutely support your constitutional right to wear any shirt you like ( or no shirt , if that floats your boat ) . 
  but it definitely is an example of intolerance and disrespect towards your fellow citizens . 
  if you wana be an asshole in public fine , but embrace it and do n't try to justify it with flawed logic . 
  [ turkey 's doing the best it can ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knbyo2kqlt0 ) . 
  the refugee camps resemble small cities . 
  not a bad place to live really , every refugee is registered , food is provided , there are possibilites to work ( [ for women too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23ifmrsz0xq ) ) , law and order is enforced by turkish security forces and so on . 
  it 's only that those refugees in turkey who belonged to the upper middle class back in syria , and have some money with them decide to pay a smuggler and migrate to europe from turkey in search of better oppurtunities , perspectives etc. 
  eu definitely needs to support turkey more and provide even better conditions for the refugees there so that the incentive to migrate onwards is lower . 
  western foreign policy in the region has been a complete disaster . 
  supporting dictators and totalitarian governments here , overthrowing a democratic government there , invading a bunch of countries and triggering massive sectarian unrest , imposing economic sanctions that resulted in the deaths of [ millions of children ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/01/world/iraq-sanctions-kill-children-un-reports.html ) because of poor health and malnourishment , in turn creating widespread anti-western sentiment in the populace , so on and so forth . 
  of course , it 's entirely fair to consider other dynamics such as the arab spring , assad 's role in instigating a civil war , isis of course . 
  but it 's kinda ridiculous to discount the west from any blame and not even consider them a significant factor in this clusterfuck . 
   isis said they would use this refugee crisis what 's the source for that claim ? 
  as far as i know , the only source is buzzfeed which is ... well , buzzfeed . 
  i would link the article here but r/europe has a no buzzfeed rule . 
  search google `` this is how we send jihadis to europe '' to find the article . 
  on the other hand , in the latest issue of [ isis 's official propoganda magazine * dabiq * ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-uses-tragic-photo-alan-kurdi-propaganda-magazine-dabiq-threaten-potential-syrian-refugees-1519207 ) , they have actually said that those who migrate to europe are sinners and deserve death because they decided to migrate to lands of `` war-waging crusaders ruled by laws of atheism and indecency '' . 
  so there 's that . 
  see that is why the subject of iq and inequality is considered pseudoscientific . 
  a well established scientific theory would mean that it is constant throughout the world and is reproducable . 
  if you have widely inconsistant data and your theory works for some of the countries while is proven throughly false for others , no academic is going to take you seriously . 
  wait a second , if you 're going to dismiss singapore because of its malay minority , you might as well dismiss countries like france , germany , united kingdom etc. 
  all of which have sizable minority populations !, 
  but you would be wrong to dismiss them because these countries rank quite high ( yes , even higher than the homogeneous japan ) on the inequality adjusted hdi scale which means they have less inequality and a better standard of living despite their minorities . 
  okay so i only have skimmed through that study you posted so please forgive me if i have missed anything . 
  as far as i can see , this is not a scientific study , but is an opinion piece . 
  that is evidenced by a lot of straight line projections that are being made by the authors ( who by the way i [ googled ] ( http://emilkirkegaard.dk/ ) , and it turns out they really are n't political scientists , but bloggers . 
  a straight-line projection is a quick and dirty act of mathematics that says if trends continue the way they 're going now , the world will change in such-and-such fashion . 
  such projections almost never pan out because there are so many variables involved . 
  so i am a bit sceptical of the claims that are being made in the article . 
  but i will not dismiss it because it seems to be well researched and sourced so i will have to put it under closer inspection . 
  but the general premise of the article seems to be pseudoscientific . 
  it seems to suggest that there is a direct correlation between iq and inequality . 
  which is not the case at all . 
  there has already been a controversial book written on the subject called [ * iq and global inequality * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iq_and_global_inequality ) that was dismissed by acedemics . 
  moreover , if you compare the list of countries by [ inequality adjusted hdi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi ) with the [ list of countries sorted by average iq ] ( http://www.photius.com/rankings/national_iq_scores_country_ranks.html ) , you will not find a correlation at all . 
  hong kong , south korea , japan , singapore etc seem to have the highest average iq but they rank pretty low on the inequality adjusted hdi scale . 
  so there is that . 
  countries like france , italy , spain etc are in western europe and they have a lower hdi than japan . 
  but more importantly , the original claim of your comment was that standard of living will increase if immigration is indefinitely stopped . 
  that is not the case at all , looking at hdi trends for the last 30 years of countries which have accepted immigrants . 
  standard of living has not dropped for these countries , but has continued to become better . 
  that japan has an older population and low fertility rates and they 're not choosing the immigration route like europe has to solve their economic problems is a completely different issue . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  europe is not a singular entity . 
  there are plenty of countries in both western and eastern europe which have a lower hdi than japan as of 2014 . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ), 
   and in time living standards would rise like they have in japan what the fuck kind of article is that ? 
  it reads like satire and provides no sources to the claim the headline makes . 
  [ here 's a real source for standard of living trends ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-2-human-development-index-trends-1980-2013 ) . 
  the official measure of standard of living is hdi or human development index . 
  it has statistically improved all over the world , especially in europe since the 1980s despite all the evil immigrants . 
  in fact , the average annual hdi growth ( read improving standard of living ) between 2000 and 2013 of japan and countries which have accepted immigration are extremely comparable and in many cases , better . 
  have n't heard of any rioting in austria . 
  as for hungary , the only contact the refugees have had with hungarians is through police and blockades . 
  needless to say , one does n't really feel welcome in country where you are being monitered by armed men 24/7 . 
  the hungarian government has not reached out to these people and the hungarian prime minister has pretty much said they do n't want them there . 
  so it is understandable that those migrants want to get out of hungary . 
  sure , there is an influence of arab culture in muslim countries . 
  even in countries like china and russia , muslims read the quran in arabic and design their their mosques according to orientalist architecture . 
  that certainly does not mean pakistan is middle eastern . 
  there is also a massive influence of the roman catholic church in latin america . 
  does that somehow mean that brazil and mexico are european ? 
  not at all . 
  fact remains that pakistani people have very little in common with arabs apart from religion . 
  they speak a different language . 
  they wear different clothes . 
  they eat different foods . 
  they have different classical music and instruments . 
  religion is not such a massive force that overpowers regional traditions and cultures . 
  today , punjabi muslims from pakistan have more in common with punjabi sikhs from india than they do with arabs . 
  and christian arabs certainly have more in common with muslim arabs than they have with any pakistani . 
  pakistani culture is quite distinct and is more similar to india than to iran or saudi arabia . 
  pakistan is an incredibly diverse country that is quite multicultural and multiethnic , [ punjabis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punjabis ) , [ balochis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baloch_people ) , [ pathans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pashtun_culture ) and [ sindhis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sindhis ) each have their distinct language , traditions , foods , music , history etc. 
  that has nothing or very little to do with arabian culture . 
  sure , pakistan is a muslim country but so are indonesia and malaysia . 
  i have never heard the claim that indonesia and malaysia are part of the middle east . 
  the article that you have posted is just an opinion piece . 
  even the author agrees that the perspective that pakistan is an arab country is a `` general hypotheses that necessarily oversimplifies social reality . '', 
  you are mixing a few things up . 
  islam or muslim is not a race . 
  if 45 % of the population identify as white british in a town like leicester , the other 55 % are not necessarily muslims . 
  they can be from eastern europe , they can be from africa , hell they can even be middle eastern but non-religious or christian . 
  if you look at the [ census from 2011 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leicester#demographic_comparatives ) , only 18,6 % of the population of leicester identies as muslim . 
  again , anyone can be a muslim as `` muslim '' does not imply ethnicity . 
  if a white british person converts to islam , they 're going to identify as `` white british '' in the polls are n't they ? 
   london is now minority white british . 
  again , islam is not a race . 
  we are discussing a religion over here , not an ethnicity .
