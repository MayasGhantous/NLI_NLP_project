  but they also educated their kids , to the point where irish and polish jokes make little sense in america now . 
  the nature of christian belief changed , too , so the loyalty of catholics to the pope is not what it was a hundred years ago . 
  above all , catholics integrated and were allowed to integrate . 
  in 2015 , it 's hard to remember they were ever kept out of polite american society or that serious thinkers believed they would bring down the nation 's average intelligence . 
  there is no reason whatsoever that the same will not happen to muslims in europe . 
  and one more thing , that video you have posted can be anything . 
  it can be a practical joke . 
  it can be a far right activists trying to discredit muslims . 
  the hundreds of thousands of people that have watched that video in a time frame of less than a week as well as the level of conversation in the comment 's section tells me the level of fear mongering that is happening right now . 
  do these people not realize that claims that `` muslims have 7-8 children '' are based on absolute bullshit ? 
  especially when pew research polls state that muslim women in germany have 1.8 children on average which is projected to be reduced to 1.7 in 10 year 's time ? 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/07/mdii-graphics-webready-90.png ) ) people have apparently rented their brains out because they believe anything they see or read . 
  they do n't think twice before sharing it . 
  they do n't realize that this level of internet gullibility [ is actually ruining lives ] ( http://youtu.be/-fas_2_awfy ) . 
  it 's a real thing dude . 
  not trolling . 
   jew-on-muslim murder rate i do n't think there is such a huge muslim-on-jew murder rate either . 
  there have been at most 5 high profile murder/terror cases that have been talked about a lot . 
  but as far as crime and violence is concerned , you have to acknowledge that there have been several attacks on arabs in france for example by jewish extremists . 
  just look into what the `` ligue de d\u00e9fense juive '' gets around to in that country . 
  that is why i called it a muslim-jew feud and it is because of politics . 
  i did n't call you a bigot at all !, 
  i was adressing an arbitrary third person and it 's a rhetorical thing to do in english that you can use ( see i did it again ) `` one '' and `` you '' interchangably . 
   polish people committing hate crimes at absurd levels when they go to other countries , like muslim-on-jew attacks . 
  certainly not excusable but it 's a false comparsion . 
  you ca n't deny that the muslim-jew feud in europe goes all the back to the `` blessed land '' and has to do with politics and conflicts . 
  if israel was part of poland , you 'd have a point . 
   when i meet a muslim , judging by opinion polls , i know they are more likely to have some very disturbing notions , based on the tenets that many of them hold , about things such as what to do with atheists holy shit dude , it must be a fucking tedious task to get to know new people with all that baggage !, 
  me personally , when i meet a new person i treat them as an individual and try to understand their views , their opinions and thoughts . 
  i do not treat them as a mere stastic and reduce them to an average of a sample size of some poll . 
  you should try that sometime . 
  it 's way more fun . 
  human beings are complex and not so simplistic that you can claim to understand what they think by reading a pdf . 
   i certainly think that such hostility towards gay people is far more endemic to islam in today 's world than any other religion and to ignore this problem is dishonest . 
  homophobia is a worldwide phenomenon . 
  just look at the statistics for hate crimes against gay people in eastern europe and russia . 
  and you do realise how ridiculous  and please stop the trite old mantra of `` all muslims '' . 
  you 're the one who started with the `` not all conservatives '' . 
   nobody buys it anymore except you buy what exactly ? 
  that it is wrong to generalize a religion of 1.5 billion ? 
  that it is unfair to demonize a whole group of people and not treat them as individuals ? 
  funny , i got the impression that hasty generalisations were exactly what you were arguing against when someone tried to push a meme regarding what conservatives think . 
  bigotry comes in a lot of forms . 
  being anti-jew is somehow a taboo in today 's society but anti-muslim has apparently become a fad . 
  sure jews are somehow described as a race too but the overwhelming majority of today 's muslim migrants are arabs as well and when you 're generalizing about muslims , i am going to call you a bigot . 
  notice that anti-muslim is not the same as anti-islam . 
  being anti-islam or anti-christianity or anti-dogmatic - religion is absolutely fine and should in fact be encouraged . 
  but it does n't mean that it is fine to demonize a whole sub-group of people by reducing them to a meme and not treating them as individuals . 
   being against gay marriage does not mean you hate gay people and want to kill them . 
  and you think the immigrants are homophobes and want to kill gay people ? 
   not all conservatives are homophobes look at you defending conservatives and telling everyone to be more nuanced ( something i support btw ) . 
  but then in the next breath you generalize all the muslim immigrants as `` homophobes '' and `` people who hate gay people and want to kill them '' . 
  how is that fair ? 
   bavaria told girls to dress modestly and who 's fault is that ? 
  that 's right , fucking bavaria . 
  not the refugees . 
  not to mention it is incredible bigotry of low expectations . 
  we are n't talking about refugees at all but about ethnic homogeneity that supposedly is `` always '' stable and preferrable . 
  if you want to talk about illegal immigration , it is another conversation . 
  excuse my ignorance , but what exactly is that flag ? 
  and what are they protesting for in that picture ? 
  edit ; found out it 's about the [ catalan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence ) independence movement . 
  saw [ this documentary ] ( https://vimeo.com/117157228 ) about the polish organisation [ national radical camp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_radical_camp_1993 ) , they seem pretty damn fascist and nationalist to me . 
  do n't know how widespread support for them is though . 
  seems to be working well in singapore which is a [ multiethnic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_singapore#ethnic_groups ) , [ multifaith ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_singapore ) and multicultural country and has a [ higher human development index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) , higher [ gdp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ppp_per_capita ) than any eastern european state . 
  then we have north korea , an utter shit hole yet the most homogeneous country in the world . 
  so it is a bit more nuanced than what you 're selling . 
  i understood the u/raadsman 's comment to mean that sharia means different things to different people . 
  which is absolutely true according to the polling . 
  breivik killed 77 people in 2011 and it was a mass shooting massacre . 
  so why is this event not included in the numbers for oslo ? 
  it 's actually right in the poll . 
  [ here 's the relevant page ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ ) . 
  12 % of turkish people favor sharia to be the law of the land . 
  35 % of those 12 % believes that corporal punishments are part of sharia , which makes a total of 4 % of turkish people believing in corporal punishments for thieves etc. 
  similarly , 29 % of 12 % believes in stoning which makes a total of 3.5 % of turks believing in stonng as a punishment for adultery . 
  so it is possible that a person believes in sharia in principle but rejects harsher punishments and criminalizing adultery and the like . 
  i rank these sharia loving people beside the `` god fearing '' republican voters in the usa . 
  apparently you should leave portugal too since your ruling party is anything but liberal . 
  it 's a [ populist , conservative christian democratic party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portugal_ahead ) just like akp in turkey . 
  also `` you 'll be welcome as long as you share our values '' does not apply to europe anymore ever since the rise of the far right . 
  i doubt a liberal turk will share any values with far right nationalist europeans . 
  you have to be deluded if you think pockets of islamist cult members who have no legitimacy and no power are any threat to secularism in western europe . 
  nice joke dude . 
  i 'm rigourously secular and believe in liberal principles and there have been quite a few instances that i have been called a `` schei\u00df kanacke '' on the street by some passing people . 
  btw , kanacke is an insult for a person who looks like he 's from southern part of the world ( such as turkey or the middle east ) similar to how nigger is used in the united states . 
  all in all , europe is n't as open and tolerant as it once was . 
  i blame the politicians . 
  racism against vietnamis exists though . 
  asylum homes in heidenau were attacked in the 90s where refugees of the vietnam war were supposed to come . 
  angela merkel went to the town and the neo-nazis there told her they would not let a vietnami person drink a beer and tell him to go back to his country `` as peacefully as possible '' . 
  this was in 1992 . 
  times have changed but large parts of the continent still remains xenophobic . 
  here 's the [ article and the video ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2015/08/28/so-sieht-es-aus-wenn-merkel-mit-nazis-spricht_n_8055162.html ) to refresh your memory . 
  not to mention , anti-semitism is an even bigger problem than hate crimes and racism against africans so by your logic , jew-hatred is justified too because it is more prevelant and thus must have a justification ? 
  bullshit logic though . 
  there certainly is racism against vietnamis . 
  remember the attacks on asylum homes in germany in the 90s and young angela merkel who was a federal minister at the time appeared on tv to talk with neo nazis ? 
  here 's the [ video ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2015/08/28/so-sieht-es-aus-wenn-merkel-mit-nazis-spricht_n_8055162.html ) if your memory is so short . 
  they are not drowning because of bad decisions but because they have been forced to flee their home countries because of wars and poverty and forced to take difficult and deadly routes .
