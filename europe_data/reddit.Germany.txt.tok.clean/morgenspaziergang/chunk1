hoffmann von fallersleben also intended the text to be used as a drinking song ; the second stanza 's toast to german women and wine are typical of this genre . 
  source : [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutschlandlied#additional_or_alternative_stanzas ), 
  the current german national anthem is a drinking song . 
  yes . 
  if you like being stereotyped . 
   i would like to keep it as it is ( even though / r/de seems very keen to include the gdr anthem or the kinderhymne ) . 
  because the lyrics are way better than those of the drinking song . 
  the national anthem is sung at the olympics , who are by the way a ** inter ** national event . 
  [ we got one , too ! ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snr-300 ) . 
  it 's now an [ amusement park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wunderland_kalkar ) . 
  they are really great as garden and house shoes or when you are at a public pool . 
  but i would never wear them in public . 
  i have one , but i only use it maybe once or twice a month to prepare french fries . 
  that 's a weak defense . 
  because that would be admitting that the gdr had anything that was a good idea . 
  and that is simply not done . 
  who 's giving someone too much credit , again ? 
  of course you would say that . 
  austria is basically bavaria part 2 . 
  i once went with some american exchange students to a nfl europe game . 
  it was the most boring 3 hours i had in my life , actually 1.5 , because i fell asleep . 
  basically nothing happens for about 2/3 of the time and the rules are mind boggling complex . 
  the cards were thankfully free , because the nfle was already collapsing because of lack of interest , and they gave them out in schools and universities to try to get some new fans . 
  i 'm agnostic , but tend to believe that god either does not exists or is so uninterested in us , that his existence ( or lack thereof ) does n't matter anyway . 
  hitler jokes are often seen as trivializing him and his atrocities . 
  there are very , very few good hitler/nazi jokes , and those are more often than not whisper jokes made in 1933-1945 . 
  still ... 
  organ meat is basically eaten everywhere in the world . 
  i would describe food , which goes against every human instinct ( rotten smell , literally rotten , containing living maggots , etc. 
  ) , is insanely dangerous to eat/prepare or mind-boggling complicated to prepare as bizarre . 
   population density keeps it lower , not the reverse . 
  the most dangerous places to drive here are all in less populated areas . 
  but that does n't change the fact that road fatalities are still higher in the us . 
  surstr\u00f6mming and lutefisk i can understand , but haggis ? 
  what 's so bizarre about it ? 
  it 's still much higher , if you compare the road fatalities per billion vehicle kilometers ( germany : 4.9 , us : 7.1 ) . 
  edit : you also have to consider that germany has a much higher population density . 
  then it is still a difference of 33 % , which is quite significant in my opinion . 
  especially if you consider that germany has a much higher population density . 
  and the rate in 1991 can most likely be explained with the unification : most cars in east germany were still trabants , which were years behind on safety features and standards . 
  there is a reason why the us has almost twice as much road fatalities ( per 100.000 motor vehicles ) compared to germany . 
  it 's just common sense . 
  well , seems like i 'll be rooting for a different country again . 
  my second post was ** only ** about the difficulty of storing the waste . 
  a accident like chernobyl or fukushima is maybe one in a billion , but the problem of storing and selecting the storage space is real right now . 
  see the leakage of a storage space that was selected and declared as safe only ~ 55 years ago . 
   it 's like avoiding flying on a plane because it might just crash . 
  the chances of something happening is pretty easy to calculate , since we have the experience of more than 100 years of aviation with hundred of thousands of flights per day . 
  using technology , which can be reasonably easily tested and for which procedures in case of a technical failure can be developed and tested , even before the airplane takes it 's first flight . 
  in contrast we have a problem that is already here and dependent on a lot of long term factors , ranging from technology to geology , which also will have to be constantly monitored over a extremely long time . 
  i was talking about storage space . 
  and we already had the case of a small leakage in our storage space , which was carefully selected . 
  it is . 
  we had a minor problem in our storage space , where saltwater corroded the barrels , it was caught before serious damage happened , but it shows how hard it is . 
  it has to be a earthquake free , dry space . 
  who can guarantee that for the next thousands of years ? 
  and the citizens near the proposed permanent place have to agree to it . 
  that 's the reason why we still do n't have a permanent storage space , only a temporary one . 
  the fact that you even mention the economical unwillingness shows how much of a problem this is . 
  we need to store some of the longest lasting and deadliest substances for a very long time and no one is willing to pay for it !? 
  that just shows what a bad idea this is . 
  and it is needed . 
  because it has to be stored already in a secure manner . 
  we have nuclear waste from nuclear plants since the 70 's and we have to deal with it already . 
  even if the hypothetical nuclear waste of the neanderthals would be low level waste by now , it would have been dangerous for thousands of years . 
  i do n't think that something will happen in the next 100 years , but we have a responsibility to future generations and the environment to make sure nothing will ever happen . 
  and we simply ca n't even guarantee it for the next few hundred years . 
   not to mention the nuclear waste does n't just naturally spread all over and kill people left and right . 
  ever heard of groundwater ?!, 
  there are reasons why we have some extreme laws protecting it from pollution . 
  nuclear power itself is probably one of the cleanest and most efficient forms of energy we can produce , ** but ** it has some real downsides : * nuclear disasters can happen ( see fukushima , chernobyl ) , which pollutes a large area for decades , if not longer . 
  terrorist attacks are also a remote possibility . 
  and it 's not just your country that is affected , as chernobyl demonstrated . 
  some mushrooms and some wild boars are still exceeding the permissible value of radioactive activity in bavaria . 
  * problems with storing nuclear waste . 
  you have to find a secure location where you can store the waste for the next ~ 100.000 years . 
  we would still deal with it , if the neanderthals had nuclear energy . 
  it 's practically impossible to find that storage area . 
  yeah , they 're pretty rare . 
  it might be that those are n't produced anymore at all , since i saw them in the mid to late 90 's . 
  he 's talking about schmelzk\u00e4se / k\u00e4secreme , which is sometimes sold in a tube . 
  i 've only seen those in hostels , so i would imagine that you can get those tubes at metro . 
  it 's `` schmelzk\u00e4se '' ( melted cheese ) , sometimes called k\u00e4secreme ( cheese cream ) . 
  it 's made out of at least 50 % cheese ( required by law ) , which is melted and mixed with other milk products and or salts , to keep it creamy . 
  i would n't call it a abuse and mockery and cheese , partly because it is not declared as cheese and everyone knows it , unlike the abominations that are available as `` cheese '' in the usa . 
  what ? 
  you simply take your package/letter to the nearest post office and pay for the stamps there . 
  i regularly send letters and packages to other countries and do n't have any stamps at home . 
  or does the us postal service accept mexican and canadian stamps ? 
   as to conscription we 've done away with that entirely 6 years ago . 
  it 's not gone . 
  it 's been merely suspended . 
  because it 's not blackface . 
  it 's superficially similar ( white people paint themselves black ) , but has a completely different meaning and history behind it . 
  the execution is usually different as well . 
  most notably the missing exaggerated lips and the missing portrayal as an wannabe white , buffoon . 
  this should be a complete list : type of bottle | deposit ( eur ) ------------------- | -------------------- beer bottle | 0.08 beer bottle ( flip top ) | 0.15 other glass or hard plastic bottles | 0.15 soft plastic ( one-way bottle ) | 0.25, 
  last time i saw a military vehicle was at the fifa world cup 2006 . 
  it was a `` sp\u00fcrpanzer '' ( i could n't find the translation ) , which was used to detect possible abc attacks . 
  it was stationed at the fire station nearest to the football stadium .
