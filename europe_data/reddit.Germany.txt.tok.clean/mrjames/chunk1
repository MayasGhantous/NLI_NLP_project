oh yes . 
  [ this kind of cheese ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ts2c1yk.jpg ) is the business . 
  i love the way it 's often wrapped in a little bandage . 
  outside albufeira , it 's really not that bad . 
  my current favourite : fried bream/bass/whatever with white wine vinegar/olive oil/garlic/rosemary / sea salt/bay leaves . 
  the rosemary is bloody inspired . 
  i forget the portuguese name for this recipe , but it means business . 
  likewise , i do n't know anyone who is a ukip supporter , but that 's selection bias for you . 
  ( fyi i have a portuguese flag because i 'm living here at the mo , but i am english ) . 
  yep , western algarve . 
  okay , so i might be exaggerrating , but the part about the dogs is true at least . 
  it 's fine for most of the year , but you do n't want to be here in august ( or rather , ao\u00fbt if you know what i mean ) . 
  i have n't been north of lisbon unfortunately , but i can see how it would be quieter . 
   plus there 's all the english living in the algarve that 's the thing . 
  i 've just accepted the cacophony of barking dogs , hairdryer motorcycles , and wave after wave of avecs/spaniards/irish / other english as simply part of the deal . 
  if you 're not willing to do that , then southern europe is not for you . 
  i ca n't speak for all of portugal , but mine has very little grass and lots of fruits : oranges , lemons , loquats , grapes , peaches , tomatoes , etc. 
  why not ? 
  to that degree , from the party leader , in a live debate with another party leader ? 
  i ca n't think of one instance where that has happened . 
  it 's amazing that they 're taken as seriously as they are when numbers like that are still thrown around . 
  can you imagine a proper party trying to pull that off ? 
  i tend to see more irish and dutch people than other britons round my way . 
  ah , delicious ctap6akc . 
  have a little imagination , eh ? 
  forrins , they do fings diffrunt from wot we does . 
  we 've got a sauna in southern portugal . 
  the previous ( portuguese ) owners installed it in some bout of madness . 
  personally , i find it feels rather like hell . 
  ymmv though , many find it refreshing , especially when combined with skinny dipping afterwards . 
  did you not rtfa ? 
  nonsense . 
  leaving would mean huge job losses in both short and long term . 
  it 'd be bad for employers and employees . 
  it 's not so bad down south , but i can see how it 's not going to work in most places elsewhere - hills with portuguese drivers pottering about at great speed . 
  [ :-d ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=guillotine&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=l2bdup6_a6bb0qwlo4cwdw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=828 ), 
  i rather happen to like it :-(, 
  i 'd be interested to hear what you think of budvar ( dark ) ... 
  i 'm in prague at the moment and i 'll have to give svijany a go . 
  the pilsner urquell signs are absolutely everywhere * without exception * but it is a great beer . 
  pingo doce , cheap and cheerful, 
  in my view , the only honest approach to sustainability would be scaling back the entire fishing industry until it has time to recover to anywhere near the level it ought to be before we started fucking with it on an industrial scale . 
  blaming declines in fish stocks on whales is a completely farcical notion . 
  apex predators like whales actually * increase * stocks across the whole ecosystem -- taking them out of it leads to trouble , fast . 
  quite . 
  it also looks like a shameless ripoff of facebook ( at a glance ) . 
  i guess [vk.com ] ( http://vk.com ) does n't really count . 
  * it 's impossibly difficult to understand natively-spoken portuguese * the population effectively doubles in the summer thanks to tourists * salazar and co held the country back for decades ( as far as i understand it ) * a world leader in renewable energy * alentejo is the bit everyone pokes fun at, 
  no , it 's a real campaign :d http://whyeasternpoland.eu/en/, 
   incidentally whales , part of the traditional cuisine , are now so polluted with heavy metals that not only children and pregnant women are advised to stay away - but it is advised that everybody not eat the slightest whale meat . 
  i believe it is also advised that some people go easy on the fish . 
  the main culprit for all the pollution : coal power plants . 
  well then , at least that 's some good coal power is doing then ( somewhat indirectly ) . 
  going rate is six and twenty children orphan of latvian ( though best throw in coffin too for power of bargaining ) . 
  it was a brasseye reference .

   there 's literally nothing inside the country that can give you rabies anymore . 
  chavs  or poison you . 
  scallies  or eat you . 
  neds ^ j/k, 
  half-ashamed . 
  quothello . 
  ne'er - do-wells ? 
  it can only support so many though ; its vast hinterland is n't very agriculturally productive ( like anywhere that far north ) . 
  ha , john resig is a mod !, 
  in this context i do n't particularly care about the rest of the world and what they did , what her influence might have been ; all i know is that i and many in the older generation here see we 've suffered for it . 
  why is our water supply owned and run by private foreign companies ? 
  why are the trains run by private companies for the benefit of their shareholders when we still subsidise them and there is no choice for the customer ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with the notion of privatisation , but the sheer * scale * of it ( seen as her legacy ) is just awful . 
  apartheid , pinochet , zia ul-haq , privatisation , take your pick . 
  she did have a habit of ending up on the losing side of history , it has to be said . 
  that 's nearly 18,000 years . 
  sounds about right . 
  that is a great one but for 'm ' it would have to be use of weapons for me . 
  my favourite too ( though i am counting him as uk not just scotland of course ) . 
  i think usually in portugal it varies greatly for different regions , but come december it is very rainy . 
  that 's an amazing image . 
  try czech . 
  i hear it 's rather difficult and even has pronouns for animate/inanimate things as well as genders . 
   ... i just felt all of my ancestors collectively turn in their graves . 
  except the normans . 
  i 'm english and though my dad is from paris , i 'm buggered if i can make heads or tails of francais . 
  good luck with it !, 
  mike drive the car right now . 
  mike want go other english class for make learn grammar good . 
  i 'm from england ( so i do n't speak any other languages , predictably ) and i 'm currently learning german . 
  i really enjoy it as a language ; i appreciate the clear structure and it 's quite nice when softly spoken , though i wish they would do away with unnecessarily gendered words inter alia . 
  yes , it goes directly to http://tesco.com, 
  reminds me of the flag i made for r/unitedkingdom http://i.imgur.com/rjqb53j.gif, 
  in munich i wondered how vegetarians and coeliacs etc. 
  could possibly manage . 
  everything is made of wheat/meat/beer , seemingly in equal measure . 
  to me the cuisine was glorious ( never tried this though ) . 
  there is no curry that can possibly compete with a good sunday roast ; that gets my vote . 
  j'agree re : eels . 
  i wish i could speak english . 
  one of these days ... 
  1,000.00 = 1.000,00 it 's not that complicated .
