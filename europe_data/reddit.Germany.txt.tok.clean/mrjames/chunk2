  sorry , i mean these guys : [ bohemia interactive ] ( http://www.bistudio.com/ ), 
  so much for dvorak and ... and ... ooh , arma !, 
  `` brown for first course , white for pudding . 
  brown is savoury , white 's the treat . 
  of course i 'm the one who 's laughing because i actually love brown toast . '', 
  nah , i 'm not going to be putting on airs with this indoor socks business ... barefoot 's where it 's at . 
  i agree . 
  pigs and cows are nice enough creatures , but they have been bred for meat whereas horses have been bred for utility . 
  i believe in fair treatment for all animals of course , but since there are so many millions more other farm animals than horses , i still think of them as separate . 
  the thought of some chinese/koreans etc eating dog seems like cannibalism to me . 
  there were ritual buried dog skeletons from 27000 years ago found in the czech republic - more evidence showing that our ancestors in europe were as successful as they were thanks to their symbiotic relationship with early dogs . 
  there are chickens outside my window in nw6 ( thankfully only little bantam hens though ) . 
  vichy france yuo are genuis !!, 
  ^ or ^ something, 
  are we referring to the aesthetics of the written or verbal form ? 
  as far as verbal aesthetics go , german usually sounds very soft and gentle to me , which is quite appealing . 
  with english ( my native tongue , fairly posh accent ) , i think speakers can get the most out of it by enunciating certain letters/syllables very * slowly * and deliberately . 
  ac-quiesce * nncce * .

  my least favourite would have to be spanish -- i just ca n't stand the sound and rhythm , sorry !, 
  or lond ... no , that 's about right . 
  isle of man operating in stealth mode , i see . 
  exactly , i should unupvote the guy . 
  do you mean travelling from the us ? 
  not sure , perhaps ba might be a good bet ? 
  you may also find the choice of airport more important . 
  if you mean in europe , we do uk -  portugal with dogs via the ferry to san sebastian , much easier . 
  malcolm tucker was swedish all along ? 
  i have to say , our danish chum 's comment seems quite reasonable , and does n't seem overly feminist . 
  i do n't agree that it is bullshit . 
  i think your edit needs an edit , mate . 
  i want to get rid of them , but it 's never going to happen with public opinion the way it is . 
  so long as lisbon time is gmt +0 we 're all good .

  my version utilises handy emoticons as shorthand for making light of entire regions . 
  http://i.imgur.com/voiyg.png i feel like the boundaries are about right though ( this is from a uk perspective ) . 
  that 's gibraltar gone then . 
  oh sorry my mistake , i think it was actually about not being able to avoid french tax if living and working in monaco . 
  i know someone in the process of setting up a company in monaco and hear bits and bobs . 
  i 'll try a few headlines and we 'll see what happens .

  all i know is french citizens ca n't live in monaco ( iirc ) . 
  i would hazard a guess that it is mostly luxury apartments as it is very compact and rich . 
  very informative post , thanks . 
  any slavic , germanic , french , that works . 
  some people have the wrong impression of german , but i find it 's a charming language when softly spoken . 
  there is n't really a polite way of saying it : other english accents just do n't work for me as i can only hear the bad parts ( not that mine is perfect ) . 
  i 'm the same way . 
  i know ps is excellent , but i just ca n't bear it . 
  iasip is just amazing , full stop . 
  it 's because 789 . 
  i do n't mind [ tom watson mp ] ( http://5secondfilms.com/watch/keeping_you_safe ), 
  that 's funny , they 're two of the uk political figures i hate the most :-), 
  i make a point of saying ' a historic ' because you would never say ` an helicopter ' . 
  that 's exactly what i meant : some english people see amsterdam as the place to go for that sort of thing . 
  seeing some of the other comments here about brits on holiday ... it 's a bad rep , 
  iceland and turkey for the largest geographic extents . 
  it would be pointless .

   isle of man - jeremy clarkson island damn that 's depressing . 
  my only consolation is that he lost in his attempt to prevent public access in langness http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/jeremy-clarkson-loses-fight-over-langness-1-4490271 i recently enjoyed my freedom walking over there , very satisfying . 
  finland . 
  i just loved the nature , the people and their sense of humour , the lifestyles ... great stuff !, 
  mind you , i have n't been in the winter , so i guess i do n't really know finland . 
  what he says is also untrue when it comes to the lack of support for gm . 
  we have [ rothamsted ] ( http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/ ) which is publically funded agricultural science , which was recently defended ( successfully ) against extremist anti-science types . 
  thanks for getting past the paywall . 
  he should stick to science imho . 
  nature via nurture was an excellent read . 
  i agree , this sounds like a good option . 
  we 're considering opening a brno office as a subsidiary of the uk company ; it has lots to offer . 
  j'agree , i had a cool yule in buckinghamshire . 
  i 'm not a christian but i believe anglicans sometimes do go ? 
  i know of one person who did . 
  but nl + ch population is double that of colorado + washington . 
  ( that said , i 'm not a big fan of recreational drug use anyway so this is hardly something to be proud of ), 
  it * is * rational , as this should be judged on an individual basis rather than a sweeping generalisation . 
  anything else is sexism . 
  you said  and you 're not allowed to just pick a region from a neighbor and uk/eire and germany/france are neighbours ? 
  does n't really matter though , 
  so that 's 1023 per capita in the eu , 999 per capita in the us . 
  good points . 
  personally i do n't eat any fish but it 's all good . 
  that is a shocking statistic ( about worldwide fish stocks ) . 
  consumption has to be curbed , basically - what else can you do ? 
   germans = ugly women fuckers does not compute, 
  uk ( + ) the jobs and opportunities . 
  uk ( - ) the insane house prices ( and they 're small houses at that ) .

  bloody immigrants , coming over here , doing our sums / s ^ ( math/s ), 
  you could do a celtic nations thing : ellan vannin / isle of man - the south , it 's beautiful - snaefell has great views on a clear day cymru / wales - snowdonia ? 
  eire / ireland - no idea , anyone ?
