yeah , after 5 days , this number should be at least in the thousands . 
  bad bot . 
  literally . 
  it 's not fashionable in germany , but not uncommon . 
  and why would n't you have it , at least in bedrooms ? 
  any other floor is cold in the mornings , so you put carpet there anyway . 
  why not carpet everything from the get go ? 
  according to a friend that actually lives there , there 's only two types of people there : old people that are salty because they live in chemnitz , and young people who want to leave chemnitz lest they join the former group . 
  metternich got his own champagne brand , he must be right !, 
  there seems to be a lot of those . 
  ( `` do your parents live on a slope ? '' ), 
  is another one . 
  at least you do n't have the same graphy for different sounds . 
  and just in case you are unaware : die partei currently has a seat in the eu parliament : mep martin sonneborn . 
  also , there 's usually * something * by schiller , but there 's no real `` must read '' there . 
  kabale und liebe ( aka emilia galotti : entertainment edition ), 
  there 's a difference in that people with jack wolfskin jackets are actually far more likely to use them in heavy weather , i.e. 
  drawing the actual intended benefit from them . 
  the same can not really be said for suv owners ( unless the actual intended benefit of an suv is the ownership and implied ~ ~ penis ~ ~ purse size itself ) . 
  germans love outdoor jackets even if they do n't go trekking . 
  or they passionately hate them . 
  as someone `` guilty '' of having such jackets myself : they 're practical . 
  they keep you warm and/or dry , which is 100 % what i want from a jacket . 
  the fashion aspect of it is far secondary . 
  ironically , once your teenagers grow up , they can come to our asparagus fields and pick them to get paid !, 
  ( please come , our agriculture kind of depends on you . ), 
  ## penis !, 
  i had a couple of months to pass between the end of my civil service and the beginning of the semester at university , and no money for traveling so i did an internship in that time . 
  i worked at a automation company , doing measurements on test patterns that had to be run on the machines before they could be disassembled and shipped to the customer , i.e. 
  in-house quality assurance . 
  it was quite nice , there was four of us , and we often just hung around drinking coffee and playing flash games , waiting for another test pattern to be done so we could do our work . 
  unfortunately , we were often among the last to leave the office ( except for paul , who had regular scheduled calls with the american west coast ) , finishing the measurements late on friday evenings so that disassembly could start immediately on monday morning . 
  payment was a bit strange though . 
  as a non-student intern , i got paid 8 $ / h , while the permanent student intern ( `` werksstudent '' ) got 12,50 $ / h for exactly the same job . 
  we had a very similar thing with sheets of [ diddl writing paper ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/111744903813-0-1/s-l1000.jpg ) . 
  i never understood it , but a lot of kids in my class were actively collecting different sheets of paper . 
  [ their boat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/kelly_family_hausboot.jpg ) is on display in a museum in speyer for whatever reason . 
  we traded zanzibar for helgoland and access to a river that does n't even lead where we thought it did . 
  there 's a huge waterfall in the way ffs . 
  he 's only not done so yet because the evil europeans took his cavfefe . 
   singaporean is very similar to standard american english and the two can be hard to distinguish . 
  you should be flattered . 
  they actually gave us the option to uncensor the original half-life not too long ago !, 
  ( not sure about cs : s ), 
  yes , albeit on a personal level . 
  celebrate ? 
  and that simply boils down to the fact that `` they died for a good cause . '', 
  does n't apply . 
  they did the same here , too . 
  wow . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_river_gee_county.svg#/media/file:flag_of_river_gee_county.svg ), 
  that 's probably true for any field though . 
  you guys make great sausages and prince polo . 
  as a southwesterner : [ there 's also a griffon and a stag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/grosses_landeswappen_baden-w%c3%bcrttemberg.svg ) !, 
  is that `` you 'll get our nukes over my dead body '' or `` we 're gon na actively work on nuclear deterrents over my dead body '' ? 
  instead of `` upgrading '' to the gymnasium after the realschule , many students proceed to a berufskolleg . 
  and while you ca n't get a `` general university maturity '' ( allgemeine hochschulreife ) aka abitur , they offer `` topical university maturity '' ( fachhochschulreife ) allowing you to study in more technically , industry-oriented schools . 
  i 'll add * lessing - emilia galotti * schiller - kabale und liebe , aka emilia galotti 2 - flamboyant boogaloo ( i.e. 
  so much more entertaining ) * schiller - die r\u00e4uber * kafka - der prozess ( and/or die verwandlung ) * grass - die blechtrommel ( or another of his gdansk works ) and then some more . 
  most of it is classic drama , with a few novels thrown in to the mix . 
  in germany , we do n't have our own english channels as far as i can tell . 
  that said , you can usually get a couple of international channels in english , like bbc world news , cnn , cnbc , al jazeera international , etc. 
  bbc world news is even available on analog tv . 
  most if not all of them . 
  * opel is working on the ampera e. * mercedes has recently unveiled its plans for the eq line . 
  * bmw has the i3 and iirc the next 3er will be available in electric as well . 
  * vw has the e-up . 
  do n't know about audi . 
  nobody touches tesla 's market yet though , which is luxury electric cars . 
  though i guess tesla 's model 3 will overlap with the i3 , assuming tesla starts to actually deliver . 
  `` potato salad is made with mayonaise . '', 
  for reference : * [ actual potato salad ] ( http://www.pizza-piccolo.at/shop/media/images/popup/salat_kartoffel.jpg ) * [ atrocity where someone accidentally put potatoes in a pasta salad instead of pasta ] ( http://www.deutsche-hausmannskost.de/images/img_recipe/180_kartoffelsalat_750x500.jpg ), 
  i occasionally watch these kinds of videos , too . 
  iirc , one the creators ( an american that vlogs about living in germany ) mentioned at some point that 80 % of the views are from users in germany . 
  small clarifications : there 's a minimum amount of driving lessons , including several specialized ones : night , countryside and autobahn . 
  not all tests include the autobahn or reverse parking . 
  it 's up to the examiner to decide where to go and what to do . 
  mine actually asked me to check the oil . 
  what ? 
  there 's way more crappy ones than those . 
  aw man , i completely forgot about that show !, 
  [ bom bom bom bobom bobo bom bom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfbmnssftmc ), 
   ( except the fermented soybeans , but you quickly learn to avoid them because they smell like vomit ) i tried those once . 
  i 've never had a stronger reaction to food in my life . 
  i ca n't even say they tasted bad , but my body apparently decided that the stuff is poison and made me gag . 
  the stuff is * physically revolting * ( to me ) . 
  came all the way from rome to sanctify my little hometown 's newly built church . 
  he was the real mvp . 
  sadly , the church no longer follows the teachings of the holy see . 
  and then there 's dmax , for your daily dose of horribly-scripted , horribly-acted and horribly-voiced-over reality tv about hillbillies on the verge of bankruptcy . 
  good question , not exactly sure about the answer . 
  if i 'm reading this right , non-germans are eligible if they have some form of right of residence in germany that is * not * related to the studies themselves . 
  what ? 
  no people on [ walz ] ( http://www.unesco.de/uploads/tx_unescosearch/images/walz5_c_confoederation_europaeischer_gesellenzuenfte__09.jpg ) where you live ? 
  in germany , tuition costs are less than 1000 $ per semester . 
  not sure about the current numbers , it depends on the state and the university itself . 
  costs of living are the bigger issue . 
  there 's never enough student housing ( which is subsidized , but not free ) to accommodate every student , so many live in privately rented shared flats or studio apartments . 
  most students get funded by their parents . 
  if that 's not possible , students may be eligible for funding via the * berufsausbildungsf\u00f6rderungsgesetz * ( vocational training funding law ) , or * baf\u00d6g * for short , depending on their exact financial situation ( including parents , spouses , etc. ) .
