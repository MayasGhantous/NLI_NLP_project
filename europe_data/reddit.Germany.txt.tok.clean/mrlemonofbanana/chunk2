  baf\u00d6g is basically a government loan at 0 % interest . 
  you have to start paying it back once you finish your studies ( you can delay , but then you have to pay interest ) , but to a maximum of 10000 $ . 
  actual stipends exist as well , but it 's hard to say anything about them . 
  there 's hundreds of different ones , from a plethora of organizations , all of which can have very specific requirements regarding your grades , age , gender , ethnicity and whatnot . 
  additionally , many students take up part-time jobs . 
  i padded my income by working as a ta for the university , correcting and discussing students ' homework assignments or lab courses ( this was physics ) . 
  while we 're working on the electoral system : * allow prisoners to vote . 
  they 're citizens of the united states and should have the right to choose their president . 
  * allow the overseas territories to vote ( i * think * they ca n't atm , but correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
   not every state has the option to mail in a ballot . 
  voting by mail should also be universally possible as well , so people can vote despite work or kids or being in aruba . 
  kennedyallee , too , to name one named after a foreign person . 
  * die partei - they 're very good . 
  not sure if this fits , but i have a problem with [ fermented black beans ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5hzrfutobru/vq9z0iehjii/aaaaaaaabku/l-1mkn4ecgy/s1600/p1040276-001.jpg ) . 
  a chinese former colleague of mine put the stuff on his lunch , so i tried them . 
  i ca n't even say i do n't like the taste . 
  i never really go to taste them because i found them * physically revolting * . 
  something about them caused my body to go `` that 's poisonous , spit it out !, 
  no , do n't swallow this , it 's poison !, 
  i 've only ever seen `` '' in french . 
  '' `` is the german version , and it 's still quite common in books . 
  we 're actually not bad at that either . 
  our men 's table tennis team got bronze in the 2016 olympics . 
  * apfelschorle * : apple juice mixed with sparkling water . 
  i mean , there 's posters on the lantern posts in all the major roads with mostly pointless slogans . 
  although these are mostly for the local candidates , i.e. 
  the direct vote part ( `` erststimme '' ) of the parliamentary election . 
  apart from `` hating '' nickelback because it 's fashionable , i believe the biggest criticism is that they 're * too good * for what they produce . 
  they could be better if they experimented more , but they keep producing tame mainstream music . 
  i got fined once . 
  there were no cars , and i wanted to catch a tram across the street . 
  did n't notice there were policemen standing right behind me until they called out for me to stop . 
  they were pretty nice about it , but they had zero plausible deniability in that case . 
  literally . 
  did n't mean to offend , sorry if i did though . 
  just wanted to make sure we 're one the same page here . 
  i 'm sure there 's plenty of people out there who [ have never heard ] ( https://www.xkcd.com/1053/ ) about measurement cups . 
  i get your point about the lack of accuracy , and i agree to a part . 
  just asking for clarity : are you aware that cups are well-defined units of ( volume ) measurement rather than a random kitchen cup ? 
  stauffenberg would be fairly controversial . 
  i mean , he and his collaborators stood up to a dictator , but their means were nothing short of terrorist assassination ploys ( yes , plural , they failed * a lot * ) , and their motives were n't great either ( hitler ruined germany ) . 
  i would * especially * not group him with sophie scholl . 
  if there 's one thing the us really nailed , it 's their state park/national park system . 
  there 's a lot of unique landscape being preserved while also being open to explore , with well-maintained but natural hiking trails . 
  there 's also people dressing as witches and cutting off the mayor 's tie or some shit , but that 's not the important part . 
  einstein and beethoven , maybe . 
  and all of them will stand the test of time better than merkel . 
  but right now , i 'm fairly sure merkel is better known than the rest you mentioned . 
  he 's technically german , the best kind of german . 
  he 's * also * austrian since 2010 . 
  at the moment , i guess it 's merkel . 
  or christoph waltz . 
  damn , i 'd move to prague and steal your beer in retaliation , but it 's so cheap it 's not really worth stealing . 
  where 'd you move to ? 
  and yes , we * tried * for the double , it was not well-received ... 
  wolves are increasingly common in eastern germany , specifically brandenburg and saxony , having crossed over from poland and czechia ( thanks , schengen ) . 
  i do n't think they made their way to the southwest yet , but i could be mistaken . 
  it 's random pictures from the internet , but here 's a couple of pictures of the northern black forest , where i grew up . 
  the namesake of the forest are dense spruce and fir forests , which cover the hillsides along deep valleys ( [ 1 ] ( http://img.travanto.de/portale/www.schwarzwald-travel.de/fotos/6957-nordschwarzwald.jpeg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/17449443.jpg ) ) . 
  the underbrush is usually fairly sparse , mosses and ferns with occasional smaller trees ( [ 3 ] ( http://www.altituderando.com/img/jpg/5/f/d/buhlbachsee_22.jpg ) ) , but areas with more foliage trees can get really dense as well ( [ 4 ] ( http://www.openpr.de/images/articles/d/1/d1a6b40355f2b82b8e163f72f8816d0f_g.jpg ) ) . 
  the majority of the forests are well-maintained , and access paths like the one seen on pic 4 are everywhere . 
  animal-wise , we got deer ( mostly roe deer , some stags ) and wild boars , but they 're well-hidden most of the time . 
  i believe the lynx is making it 's return as well , but i 've never seen a wild one . 
  how are you gon na do that if you 're alone though ? 
   but of course , that life might be so far away from us , that it might as well not exist . 
  not only in space , but also in time . 
  on a galactic timescale , civilizations are fairly insignificant . 
  i mean , what 's a million years to a star ? 
  vertical is for belgians . 
  horizontal is where it 's at !, 
  [ `` great britain gets back the thirteen original colonies , minus manhattan . 
  florida and the fountain of youth go back to spain . 
  texas , new mexico , california , arizona revolve a m\u00e9xico .

  we should really get a grip on the business students . 
  i do n't care if you study art history and serve me cappucino , but a subject where 7th grade math is taught in a university should exist . 
  this is about standards . 
  we could expand arte to you guys as well . 
  floor heating masterrace . 
  as others have said , they 're * very * rare . 
  try to get a visa or mastercard instead , these work basically everywhere in switzerland . 
  whal the people living would be called whalers . 
  and the list of countries in which cricket is played . 
  kind of . 
  i just do n't understand how you can drink beer in 0.2 l glasses . 
  the real rivalry is between cologne and d\u00fcsseldorf , i.e. 
  k\u00f6lsch and altbier . 
  but you 'd have to ask someone from there about that . 
  do n't take it as is though , please . 
  we have state-level educational politics . 
  with every state doing their own education reforms ( and sometimes going * back * because some people complained about them ) , it 's a tremendous mess . 
  i mean , some states only recently got ( state - ) centralized final exams , and others still do n't have these . 
   beauvais is not in fucking paris , i do n't care how you brand it . 
  neither is stansted in london or frankfurt hahn anywhere close to ( either ! ), 
  i mean , it 's a 1h30 drive by car , and [ * google does n't know * to get there by public transport ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/50.1074467,8.6648276/frankfurt-hahn+airport+\\ ( hhn \\ ) , +55483 + hahn-flughafen,+germany/@50.0055592,7.6635253,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x47be180426b4755f:0x3db29c6e96461c58!2m2!1d7.2641958!2d49.9458052!3e3 ) . 
  on the female side of things , marie was the 7th [ most popular girls name in 2016 ] ( http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/jahrgang/j2016 ) , maria was 50th . 
  as a [ second name ] ( http://www.beliebte-vornamen.de/jahrgang/j2016/zweitnamen-2016 ) , they 're second and third place . 
  beer is being drunk , but preferred kind of beer varies locally as well . 
  some areas prefer pils , others prefer wheat beer .
