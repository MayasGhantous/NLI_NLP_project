  some places prefer their own stuff which is apparently so pristine , you can only buy it in tasting glasses ( hello , cologne ) . 
  to be fair , it 's [ complicated ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ), 
  for germany , there 's the [ guillaume affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillaume_affair ) . 
  g\u00fcnter guillaume , one of chancellor willy brandt 's personal assistants turned out to be a stasi spy . 
  the affair caused the fairly popular brandt to resign as chancellor . 
  is a kid 's rhyme , mostly used when trying to figure out who has to start in tag or hide-and-seek or similar . 
  the first and third part are utter gibberish , the second part means `` somethings rumbling in the box '' , the fourth part means `` you 're out '' . 
  then there 's this utter gibberish :  am bam bi , kolonie , kolonastik , am bam bi , kolonie - akademi safari , akademi piff paff !, 
   guild wars 2 there 's dozens of us !, 
  now i want to see a vector map of costs of living gradients throughout europe . 
  also , the [ hambacher fest ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/hambacher_fest_1832.jpg ) of 1832 , showcasing the people 's wish for a unified germany . 
  i 'll give him a hand here and point out that * sept-cent-soixante-dix-sept * is at least consistently pronounced . 
  * sept-cent-septante-sept * on the other hand has 2 silent ps and one that is n't . 
  that 's about all i know of him . 
  an english version ( keeping the rhyme ) would be `` three three three , near issus repartee . '', 
  referring to the [ battle of issus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_issus ) in 333bc . 
  adding on here : schlange : snake and queue ( the line one , not the pool one ) zug : train and air draft, 
   germany , domestic flights [ ... ] to wien . 
  do n't forget the music . 
  really , if you do n't fancy [ helene fischer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haect-serhk ) , [ dj \u00d6tzi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km2q76jqn24 ) , or [ this one `` by '' rammstein ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5pm3oyeky8 ) , stay the fuck away from any bierzelt . 
  and eat it , too . 
   not like it was hard to get out of military service . 
  a guy in my neighborhood got out because he 's * very very slightly * asthmatic . 
  he had a second dan in taekwondo at that time ( maybe more now ) , and he used to ride the 5 km to school in about 8 minutes with his bike . 
  never seen him inhale shit . 
  asthma my ass , he was way more capable physically than me . 
  in germany , the `` nursing insurance '' ( pflegeversicherung , hard to translate ) was overhauled . 
  old ( or young , i guess ) people who are in need of nursing get more money . 
  also , people suffering from dementia are recognized by the system better than before , e.g. 
  people who just * forget * to eat are now treated similar to people unable to eat . 
  oh , and because i just now learned about it : parents of children younger than 9 years old may now ride their bicycles on the sidewalk to accompany the kid , rather than having to drive on the road . 
  they have to yield to pedestrians at all times though . 
  other than that , some numbers where adjusted in the social and tax systems . 
  what 's the significance of what i 'll call the two kings and the bishop ( the ones with the fur and the purple ) ? 
  wait , what 's with the flower-thingy on both of them ? 
  what did the romans ever do for us , anyway ? 
  in particular , it made it easy to * find * your filter bubble . 
  thanks to the internet , you are no longer the solitary crazy person in your hometown because you believe earth to be flat . 
  well , technically you are , but there 's like-minded people outside of your hometown are easily accessible now . 
  that 's a horrible graph . 
  why the fuck is there even a `` father '' side if paid leave for fathers is counted as paid leave for mothers in cases where the parents are free to * choose * ? 
  if the mother/father distinction is important in order to show gender asymmetry , `` either '' * has * to be it 's own column . 
  i mean , it 's like making a graph of / r/europe subscribers , sorting them by gender , and listing every user whose gender is not known as male , because it 's more likely or some such crap . 
  it makes no fucking sense . 
  especially considering that ttip has all the issues ceta has , and then some big ones on top . 
  y' all just jealous of our capability of producing one tatort after the other !, 
  ( even though many of them outright suck . 
  sack the munich team already ! ), 
  interesting , i 'd like to know the exact metric here though . 
  especially considering that 98 % of german jokes about polish people are a variation of `` something something polish people steal cars '' . 
  so how does it outweigh us joking about the dutch not qualifying for the world cup/euro , or the french tendency to surrender ^ ( 1 ) ? 
  ------------ ^ ( 1 where exactly does that stereotype come from , actually ? 
  the french have been rather tenacious in the last couple of centuries , apart from a couple of bad weeks in 1940 ), 
  as much as i 'm inclined to go for a scientist myself , i 'd have to say goethe for germany . 
  the same ad was in the german `` stuttgarter zeitung '' today as well . 
  probably in other larger newspapers as well . 
  the modern idea of being * german * really only rose in the 19th century , when people started wondering why , seeing how we all more or less spoke the same language , did n't all hate the french together . 
  unlike on a normal map of europe , where sweden is merely a ballsack . 
  can we get the eu to ban brexit discussion until the uk actually starts brexiting ? 
  fun fact : while i was studying in heidelberg , the state police ( lka ) had an undercover cop inside the far left circles . 
  i 'm not quite sure , but i may have met the guy at a house party once . 
   just to secure our position . 
  seeding greeks around the continent ? 
  smart move . 
  as a german , i can confirm that [ greek wine is like the blood of the earth .

  a drug jockey ? 
  [ map , for the lazy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yblelob.png ), 
  resistance is n't really stopping ttip imo . 
  the negotiations keep stalling to the point of being failed because us and eu simply can not agree on vital points . 
  although the resistance * do * reinforce the value our governments assign to these points . 
  people complain loudly against x , governments can not agree on x due to backlash . 
  and spain . 
  added , sorry for skipping you . 
  though to be fair , all i remember hearing in the news back then was `` lampedusa '' . 
  the only european countries that tried to do anything about people drowning in the mediterranean were greece , italy and spain , seeing as they had to deal with those that did n't drown . 
  and yes , that was a huge failure of european politics . 
  i 'm sure elsass-lothringen is used to that by now . 
  and we can offer the saarland on top when we 'll have to return them . 
  i 'm not sure because i 'm poor and never had to pay it , but it should be covered by the [ abgeltungsteuer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flat_rate_withholding_tax_ ( abgeltungsteuer \\ ) ) . 
  it seems to be 25 % for individuals , which is significantly lower than the maximum regular income tax of 45 % ( this number is fairly complicated in itself because of tax excemptions ), 
  let 's try this one again after it got removed the first time around for no reason . 
   half of the time the taxis are just waiting . 
  getting a similar coverage with licensed drivers is all but impossible otherwise . 
  the alternative to having taxis wait at the train station is to have the drivers wait somewhere else . 
  you still need to get them to traffic hubs in a hurry , so they 're on call , meaning they get paid . 
  now , granted , non-licensed drivers * can * be summoned `` at will '' ( if someone takes the call , that is ) , but i 'd really rather not have to rely on those to get anywhere . 
  just ignore the severely crooked tree ( seriously : who * bought * that ? 
  i half-expected a redirect to gchq.gov.uk, 
  this is pure bs , for multiple reasons : first of all , they are suing because of our * plans * . 
  nothing has even passed any sort of legislative * anything * . 
  secondly , the only reason this could remotely be construed as violating eu law is the * order * of introducing laws here . 
  road charges themselves are common and legal throughout europe , especially in transit countries . 
  now the german road charge is supposedly not valid because it 's meant to partially * replace * our current financing system ( vehicle tax ) . 
  i mean , * of course * the system is meant to make non-germans pay for using our road , that 's the entire point . 
  but that 's the case for every single road tax out there . 
  but our system is discriminating because , * and only because * , it was n't the first thing we came up with . 
  that 's bullshit , plain and simple . 
  this . 
  allowing women to wear a hijab for religious reasons does n't hurt anyone .
