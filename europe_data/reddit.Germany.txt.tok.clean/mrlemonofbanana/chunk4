  actually let me rephrase : allowing women or men to wear a hijab * for whatever reason they want * , because * some * women do it for religious reasons , does n't hurt anyone . 
  ^ ( ( i.e. 
  allow it because it 's religious , but remove the religion requirement for allowing it ) ^ ), 
  i 'm wondering if it would n't actually be beneficial to wear a hijab . 
  hair is n't useful as you said , and anything that 's not useful is ultimately distracting . 
  the hijab forces you to focus on the face itself . 
  true , but not applicable here . 
  this is people arbitrarily introducing * new * rules for a photo in a passport . 
  yes , you have to abide by the rules of your country , but that does n't mean that these same rules should be held to scrutiny . 
  exactly . 
  i lived in the french parts of switzerland for a while and all my 5 years of french in school amounted to was a decent knowledge of french grammar . 
  turns out , knowing how to conjugate a verb into * futur simple * does n't help you much if you do n't know the verb . 
  translations of the titles , to avoid confusion . 
  main title :  a country loses freedom  #hotspot turkey minor titles :  ### the dictator erdogan 's policies after the coup  ### kurds fight for an own nation  ### integration the fear of german turks, 
  exactly . 
  what ireland did was essentially give away something for free when they could have actually * sold * it , had they tried . 
   very good . 
  do n't know it that was intentional , but that 's literally their slogan . 
   vote for the party . 
  it is very good !, 
  that 's what we 've been telling greece for years !, 
  yeah , she 's doing good work . 
  i might just vote pirate in the next ep elections because of her . 
  it 's a shame her party is all but dead because of internal issues and failure to agree on a common agenda . 
  tbf ouzo is a pretty nasty drink . 
  i 'd avoid it , too . 
  could n't we have gone for middle eastern and arabic nations instead ? 
  mean immigrants are much more befitting the political climate !, 
  exactly . 
  on that entire purple line from strasbourg to paris ( which is awesome if you want to get to paris ) , there 's only about 2 cities worth even * considering * to stop at : reims and metz . 
  ( note to self : never again drive to paris by car ) in fact , the tgv from karlsruhe stops only in strasbourg . 
  the tgv from mannheim has its last stop before paris at saarbr\u00fccken . 
  from there , it 's a straight ~ 3h ride to paris est. 
  spiegel is n't . 
  spiegel online though ... 
  i noticed the spiegel report does n't cite any sources ( `` seibert * is going to * say ... '' ) , indicating that their information was inofficial . 
  now , it might be that someone leaked them some true info . 
  or they jumped the gun for views .

  my own translation , because google 's has glaring issues :  ## kauder : merkel does not distance herself  ** a report that the government wants to distance itself from the armenian resolution of the bundestag , ensures intense irritation in the coalition . 
  then denied the union group chief . 
  **  chancellor angela merkel does not distance itself , according to union parliamentary leader volker kauder ( cdu ) of the disputed armenian resolution of the bundestag . 
  kauder told the chiefs of the union 's parliamentary group on friday in berlin that merkel had stated it in an interview the morning , that she had supported the resolution . 
  she emphasized that she does not take distance from it . 
  kauder reported that a representative of the foreign office had , in talks with the turkish side , pointed to the homepage of the bundestag , where the character of a resolution is described . 
  it states that resolutions have no binding effect and are not law . 
   previously , a `` spiegel '' report on a possible distancing of government from the armenia resolution of the bundestag had caused considerable irritation in the grand coalition . 
  this gesture to the turkish government should achieve that german mps may visit german soldiers stationed in the turkish incirlik again , it said . 
  `` spiegel online '' reported government spokesman steffen seibert was supposed to distance himself on behalf of the government from the armenia resolution , which had classified the crimes against the armenians during world war i as genocide . 
  a more detailed statement from seibert is expected before noon , the report said . 
   ** schwesig : `` no one from the federal government should waver '' **  the deputy spd chairman manuela schwesig had rejected a distancing of the armenian resolution then . 
  `` i take no stock in this at all , '' the federal family minister told n24 on friday . 
  `` the bundestag has adopted the resolution with a large majority . 
  and even though i 'm not a member of the german bundestag , i support the decision as a member of the federal government and that no member of the government should waver . '', 
   federal foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier ( spd ) initially left the exact stance of the federal government open on friday . 
  after meeting with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg , he said in berlin : `` the german bundestag has every right and freedom to express themselves on political issues . '', 
  however , the bundestag themselves state that `` not every resolution is legally binding . '', 
   in the resolution that the bundestag had adopted on june 2 , the crimes against the armenians during world war i are classified as genocide . 
  most members of the federal government , including chancellor angela merkel ( cdu ) , vice chancellor sigmar gabriel and steinmeier ( spd ) remained absent of the vote - officially some of them for scheduling reasons . 
  in early june , the offended turkey government denied german mps the right to visit bundeswehr troops stationed in incirlik because of the adoption of the resolution . 
   ** some in the union feared a `` fatal signal '' **  in the union parliamentary group , the reports initially caused irritation as well . 
  group vice-chairman stephan harbarth said before the start of a session of the executive board in berlin on friday : `` the position of the union group remains unchanged . '', 
  a board member told deutsche presse-agentur , a distancing by chancellor angela merkel would be `` fatal '' . 
   the board of the union faction stated , a distancing by merkel would be `` the completely wrong signal '' towards the turkish president tayyip recep erdogan , who had personally attacked members of the bundestag , in particular those with turkish ethnicity , after the resolution . 
  epfl had those exact things for a test a while back . 
  they are slow as molasses on a rainy winter day . 
  granted , epfl 's test route was ridiculous , with a stop in the only ( ! ), 
  place on campus where it 's impossible for even a cyclist to pass . 
  i hated them with passion . 
  that 's nowhere near 100m behind your vehicle !, 
  which circumstances make refusal of * any muslim migrant * acceptable ? 
  fun bonus : last i heard , a court has ruled that free permission illegal , since it pertained to * only * google , creating an unfair advantage . 
  true . 
  these are single standards . 
  in that the ipc has some , unlike the ioc . 
  the short version is that germany really hates erdogan . 
  basically starting with the extra3 song leading to erdogan calling the german ambassador to turkey and demanding retribution . 
  this in turn led to jan b\u00f6hmermann 's `` schm\u00e4hkritik '' , which he wrote specifically to highlight what * can not * be said ( contrary to the extra3 thingy , which is totally fine under germany 's free speech laws ) . 
  erdogan sued him based on a law many germans view as highly outdated , and despite their power to deny the lawsuit ( the government needs to explicitly allow prosecution ) , our government allowed it . 
  then there was our parliament unanimously ( ! ), 
  declared the armenian genocide as such , once again calling down the ire of ankara , with hilarious demands like blood-tests for our for turkish-born mps , to show that they are not true turks . 
  lastly , the recent behavior of the turkish government in general , far too much of which reminds us of history class , albeit it 's now 2016 in turkey rather than the 1930s in germany . 
  what i 'll take away from this article is the fact that at some point , some bankers wanted to be hip and h4xx0r , calling their new index stoxx . 
  i can only assume 570xx was taken already . 
  nah , french popes are seated in avignon . 
  it 's how they used to do it back in the day . 
  he was present at the site though . 
  the german * also * is basically the english * well , ... * not to be confused with the english * also * , which is the german * auch * . 
  ### germany * while researching the munich shooting , reddit user / u/baudusau has found another potential shooter through his instagram profile . 
  the youth is now in psychiatric treatment . 
  ^ [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4uv7bg/jugendlicher_wegen_m%c3%b6glicher_vorbereitung_eines/ ) * in the aftermath of the munich shooting , our government is thinking about lowering the requirements for army deployment within germany . 
  they are currently only deployed at natural disasters and invasions ( has n't happened yet ) . 
  ^ [ source ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-08/ursula-von-der-leyen-bundeswehr-terrorbekaempfung ) * also , a discussion on violence in video games was re-kindled , although it seems much more level-headed this time around , compared to 2009 's . 
  ^ [ source ] ( http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/familienministerin-schwesig-gegen-verbot-von-gewalthaltigen-computerspielen-3279169.html ) * the turkish community of stuttgart has joined the christopher street day parade , in order to end discrimination of gay turks both in turkey and within the german turkish communities .

  the meeting was highly controversial , seeing how germans are very wary of erdogan 's current politics ( too much of it is found in our history books ) . 
  authorities had denied the use of direct video broadcasts to turkey as they are not covered by our right of assembly . 
  apart from minor issues , everything went peacefully , as the 2700 policemen were able to separate the protesters from smaller groups of counter-protesters .

  huh ?
