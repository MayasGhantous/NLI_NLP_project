  a french colleague once told me that hating the current president is somewhat of a national pastime in france . 
  every president is declared the worst president in the history of presidents . 
  not to be confused with deutschmark and danland , the latter of which i presume to be a personal amusement park of someone called dan . 
  that 's * exactly * theirs to manage . 
  this is like being an architect building a house and drawing up ridiculous blueprints that are a nightmare for the civil engineers and construction workers , and then leaving .

   schulz wants remodeling of the eu  16:37 : the president of the european parliament , martin schulz ( spd ) has called for a reconstruction of the european commission into a as `` a genuine european government '' , as a consequence of the brexit referendum . 
  this eu government should be `` controlled by the european parliament and a second organization , to be composed of representatives of the member states , '' schulz wrote in a commentary for the `` frankfurter allgemeine zeitung '' ( major german newspaper ) . 
   schulz wrote that it was known to the people from their nation-states and would `` make political accountability at eu level more transparent '' . 
  the social democrat sees it as a way to counter the dissatisfaction with the european union . 
  instead of questioning the eu itself , citizens could `` change the european government through elections . '', 
   it 's not about more europe , but rather `` to clearly define what citizens can and may expect in certain areas of the eu '' . 
  in his opinion , the eu should not interfere in matters that may be dealt with on a national or regional level , schulz said further . 
  rather , it should focus on those issues that the european countries can only cope with jointly . 
  the article is misleading . 
  gabriel is suggesting eu member countries to offer dual citizenship to brits living in the eu , so that they can * continue * living in the eu without a hassle .

  pressure turkey * how * ? 
  i 'm sorry , this just does n't make sense . 
  from a political standpoint , acknowledging the genocide did two things : * show that erdogan does * not * get to control what politicians in germany do . 
  * piss off the turkish government . 
  this is hugely detrimental on our foreign relations . 
  if anything , germany would now need to apply even * more * pressure or be even more forthcoming to get turkey to agree to anything . 
  although it did have an additional effect : your government started uttering insane ramblings about blood tests for the turkish-born german politicians to prove that they are not true turks , making them the laughing stock of the german population . 
  this , however , is on you , not us . 
  first of all , show me the textbook that skims wwii in half a page . 
  secondly , where 's the problem with that ? 
  the war itself does n't * teach * you anything . 
  it 's these other 100-150 pages that detail how it happened that hitler got elected in the first place and how europe slid down that slope to war once more , barely one generation after the first war . 
  this is what you need to know , so you can see and prevent it the next time . 
  exactly , last i checked the greek government does n't have the money to bribe even a single member of the ioc .

  experts warn of a bloated parliament and millions of euros in additional costs . 
  *  for four years , the bundestag parties have been working to reform the controversial voting system . 
  this will definitely not happen before the next election on september 24th . 
  the stuttgarter zeitung learned this from leading representatives of the spd parliamentary group . 
  further talks were unrewarding . 
  the social democrats also question the urgency of an amendment . 
  bundestag president norbert lammert ( cdu ) recently explained : `` i am fighting for a new regulation until the last day of this parliament . '', 
  experts consider the incalculable number of overhanging and equalizing mandates to be problematic . 
  political scientists warned against a bloating of parliament in talks with stz . 
   the current bundestag holds 630 mandates instead of the planned 598 deputies . 
  after the next election it could be 700 or even more . 
  this is what the bertelsmann foundation expects , among others . 
  it refers to simulations based on survey data from 2016 . 
  the political scientist joachim behnke of the zeppelin university in friedrichshafen expects at least 20 , possibly more than 30 , overhanging mandates . 
  according to the existing electoral law they would then have dozens of equalization mandates . 
  according to behnke , parliament could grow to 660 to 700 deputies . 
  the trends , which were reflected in current surveys , further strengthened this effect . 
  at the moment there are four overlapping and 29 equalization mandates in the german bundestag . 
   ### hardly understandable to the citizen  eckhart jesse , a political scientist from chemnitz , also warns against the `` danger of a considerable expansion of the bundestag '' in an stz interview . 
  he also criticizes : the current electoral law is `` suffering from a lack of transparency '' . 
  for citizens , it is hardly comprehensible how votes translate into mandates . 
   114,000 citizens support a petition from the federation of taxpayers for the reform of electoral law . 
  their goal is `` no to an xxl bundestag '' . 
  at present , the parliamentary office costs almost 800 million euros . 
  if the plenum continues to grow , additional financial needs in the double-digit millions would be incurred . 
   `` any regulation that limits the growth of the number of seats is better than the existing situation , '' president lammert had recently explained . 
  he refused to comment on the failure of the electoral reform . 
  the number of seats had to be capped , `` otherwise we 'll be in difficult discussions in the coming months , '' warned volker kauder , head of the cdu fraction . 
  he worries about the ability to work of a greatly enlarged bundestag . 
  the legislative process will be made more difficult . 
  `` of course , it must also be taken into account that a larger bundestag costs more , '' said kauder . 
  notes and explanations : * ** spd : ** social democratic party , currently minority partner of the ruling coalition * ** cdu : ** christian democratic union , merkel 's party , currently majority partner of the ruling coalition * ** stz : ** the linked newspaper * ** overhanging mandates/equalization mandates : ** in germany , we elect * both * a person to send to parliament for our constituency by majority vote ( first vote ) , and a party federally by proportional representation ( second vote ) . 
  if a party get 's more * direct mandates * from the first votes than they 'd be assigned based on the second vote , it 's called overhanding mandate ( \u00dcberhangmandat ) .
