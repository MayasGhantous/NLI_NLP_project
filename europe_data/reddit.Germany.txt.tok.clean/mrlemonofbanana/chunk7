  this is currently dealt with by increasing the total number of seats in parliament through equalization mandates . 
  he was asking for citations of the guardian advocating no borders no country one planet bollox . 
  they got their own license plate numbers ( b\u00dcs ) despite being part of konstanz ( kn ) . 
  they 're usually ignored at borders because it 'd be a huge hassle . 
  nice video . 
  minor corrections : * there 's no bears in the black forest * cuckoo clocks are from the black forest , not bavaria, 
  price differences do not require geo-blocking imo . 
  companies should still be able to tell where you are based and force you to make an account in that country , even when the content is the same throughout all countries . 
  it 's basically the same thing valve does . 
  they see your ip changed semi-permanently , the store prices adjust ( plus some geo-blocking , but that 's not the point here ), 
  [ well ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_taiwan#types_of_relations )  taiwan has non-diplomatic , unofficial governmental relations with the european union and at least 47 states , recognizing the people 's republic of china , that maintain `` economic , trade and/or cultural '' ( or similar ) offices in taiwan . 
  also , lack of rainfall to wash the pollution from the air . 
  alright , alright , stop pushing us . 
  we 'll take all of the balkans , do n't worry . 
  where does islam come into play here ? 
  / u/paddywhacker did n't mention it , and neither did the article iirc ? 
  good point . 
  i changed the wording to better reflect my thoughts . 
  ~ ~ well , it is . ~ ~ while not racist per se , it 's still baseless discrimination . 
  i 'm 98 % confident that this guy was thoroughly checked by belgian authorities , and yet he did * not * land on some list , or he 'd never have passed esta in the first place . 
  that leaves us with three people being barred from entering the us for sports , with the sole reason that one of them has a mass-murdering terrorist in his family . 
  this is very far from just . 
  radler is awesome though . 
  or : turn off the large majority of the mentioned data collection in the respective settings . 
  and even counting them , there 'd be 6 : merkel , schulz , wagenknecht , lindner ( ? 
  ) , petry and however that green dual lead would work in case they ever won . 
   remember to use the correct terms : german nazi camps . 
  that 's a horrible name for it and a ridiculous way to end this video . 
  a nazi camp is something white supremacists send their kids to in summer . 
  these were labor camps , concentration camps or extermination camps run by nazis . 
  at the very least , call them nazi death camps . 
  look again . 
  the dutch text is labelled nl/be and only says '' +7 \u00b0 c '' with no further distinction . 
  the bottom , french text is labelled fr/be and lists '' ( fr ) +8 \u00b0 c '' and later '' ( be ) +7 \u00b0 c '', 
  that 's probably due to legal reasons . 
  maybe there 's a `` standard refrigerator max . 
  temperature '' or something defined somewhere that differs . 
  which is weird , because that sounds like * exactly * the sort of thing that gets an eu ruling . 
  i think you actually won that round , considering i have the least trust in the governments that rank high on this list . 
  `` in 1939 , polish terrorists seized control of a radio station in gleiwitz . 
  the great german reich rightfully defended itself by invading poland , which caused the french and british schemers to declare war upon our great nation . 
  we fought hard against the oppressors , and tried to liberate the russian people from their bolshevik oppressors as well , but we ultimately lost . '', 
   germans today should not carry the sins of their fathers on their shoulders . 
  move on . 
  we 're not doing that . 
  h\u00f6cke is talking about his ass . 
  just look at this part of the article :  h\u00f6cke , a former history teacher , also complained that german schoolchildren were supposedly not taught about the country 's scientific and artistic achievements this is the ridiculous quote of the year so far , imo . 
  we 're taught schiller , goethe and brecht in german class , gauss and leibniz in math , planck in physics . 
  1km away from his `` monument of shame '' , there 's a small place called humboldt-universit\u00e4t , next to several museums honoring arts and culture . 
  acknowledgment of our shitty past does n't equal atonement . 
  placing a reminder of bad memories smack in the center of our capital serves to preserve history in the minds of the people . 
  not to hold our people down , but to make them wary , as to not repeat the mistakes . 
  to answer your first point : * no * genocide should ever be forgotten , played down , or denied , especially by the legal successors of the perpetrators . 
  fish and chips in a taco ? 
  chili in a newspaper ? 
  come on , scratch that '' ( maybe ) '' . 
  abandoning nuclear power was a stupid left-wing populist bs move , precisely * because * the alternative for us is burning coal ( plus , you know , contract violation law suits and stuff that will cost millions of tax payer money ) . 
  well , of course they are . 
  the government is trying to replace us with muslims , after all . 
  big whoop . 
  back in the 17th century , all major travel was powered 100 % by wind energy !, 
  nah , just kidding , good job , dutch train people . 
  context ? 
  what * exactly * did she post ? 
  this one does n't even make sense . 
  why is turkey labeled turkey despite being placed in northern germany/netherlands but africa is labeled italy because it 's placed where italy would be . 
  why does india displace greece , when greece is right next to it ? 
  at least be consistent in your incoherent ramblings turned political caricature , garrison !, 
  they could potentially start with making politics with a clear line and a clear goal . 
  ideally , something resembling `` social democratic '' . 
  [ the swiss air force also steals water from france , ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33684713 ) for the most swiss purpose you could think of . 
  the problems boil down to nobody giving a fuck about getting it done . 
  as long as the money is freely flowing and noone has to suffer consequences , there 's no reason to ever finish it for anyone involved . 
  i mean , to the workers , ber is an infinite source of work and money , why would they ever plug it ? 
  clearly the police are guarding the christmas trees . 
  you mean less than 33 % including the fdp and the spd , neither of which would support this ? 
  ( not sure about the others ), 
  i 'm randomly reminded of my trip to venice a couple of years back . 
  on the boat bus to the hotel , there was a woman shouting at someone on the phone . 
  i do n't speak much italian , and the only word i could repeatedly understand was `` basta ! '', 
  at some point , she hung up , and got applauded by the other passengers . 
  to this day i wonder if they were just glad she hung up , or if they congratulated her for telling her good-for-nothing boyfriend/husband/son / whatever to go fuck himself . 
  that headline confused me for a bit there . 
  `` real ira figure '' , as opposed to the fake ira figure they shot last week or what ? 
  til `` real ira '' is a proper term . 
  it 's complicated and varies by state and school form . 
  for example , the rules for the [ gymnasium baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ] ( http://www.landesrecht-bw.de/jportal/;jsessionid=b19cb464bcec330530e6d0f1a751dc6a.jp81?quelle=jlink&amp;query=gymversv+bw&amp;psml=bsbawueprod.psml&amp;max=true&amp;aiz=true#jlr-gymversvbwv7p1 ) state  w\u00e4re eine versetzung wegen der f\u00e4cher sport , musik und bildende kunst nicht m\u00f6glich , ist von diesen f\u00e4chern nur das mit der besten note f\u00fcr die versetzung ma\u00dfgebend ; meaning  if a student is not eligible to pass because of the subjects sport , music or arts , only the subject with the best grade of these subjects is taken into account ( our rules are fun and easy to understand ! ), 
  i 'm fairly certain that 's the case here , so she 'll be fine . 
   you 've sacrificed your civil safety in order to help outsiders , many of whom do not respect you or your way of life . 
  we sacrificed a * very * small part of our civil safety in order to help outsiders without hope , outsiders that reached out to both our state and its people to secure * any * semblance of civil safety for themselves and integrate them back into society with a prospect for the future . 
  because we 're not fucking apathetic assholes willing to let thousands die out at the walls of fortress europe while we 're sitting inside comfortably . 
  [ aleppo , in case you fucking forgot . 
  ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/06/11/aleppo.jpg ) that said and done , we * do * now have to deal with assholes like this guy , who take advantage of this . 
  * fuck those people . 
  * * that * is a problem we 'll have to overcome , along with many other issues regarding integration . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  spain is right there !, 
  that asterisk on china though . 
  congratulations , there are [ 127 countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) worldwide you can move to with less than one intentional homicide per day . 
  although looking at an actual good statistic , homicide * rate * , you 'll find that only 22 of these countries ( 27 total ) have lower homicide rates than germany have .
