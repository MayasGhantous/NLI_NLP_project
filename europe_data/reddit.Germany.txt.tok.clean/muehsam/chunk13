  other than that , no , you can live how you want as long as you 're not acting like an asshole . 
  but that applies to natives and foreigners alike . 
  well , one part of it is probably to distinguish the federal level from the state level . 
  most heads of government within germany are called `` ministerpr\u00e4sident '' , which can be translated as `` prime minister '' , so when germany was unified , a distinction had to be made . 
  bismarck had to know when he was acting as the ( prussian ) prime minister , and when he was acting as the ( german ) chancellor . 
  pretty sure for the same reason there are vietnamese people in eastern germany . 
  `` rich '' east bloc countries like czechoslovakia and the gdr needed cheap workers , vietnam provided them . 
  of course it was framed as `` sharing skills amongst socialist brothers '' officially . 
  [ the tailor of ulm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albrecht_berblinger ) ( 1811 ) and nobody else . 
  there 's [ streetscooter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streetscooter ) , which was bought by deutsche post ag ( the formerly state owned , now privatized german mail company ) . 
  they 're using them to build their own electric cars for mail delivery , but they 're also planning to sell to other customers soon . 
  ah , yeah , mumbling makes a lot more sense . 
  thanks . 
  i think an important part of it is that there was no `` germany '' historically . 
  sure , there was some kingdom that developed into the hre , but the hre was n't `` just german '' , it had nothing about german ( y ) in it 's name and all the official things were in latin anyway . 
  there was no capital , the emperor was elected , most power stayed with the regional princes . 
  now , when you look at the names : in german ( and most germanic languages ) the name of the language is `` deutsch '' ( or similar ) which means `` of the people '' , in contrast with languages like latin that were spoken only by the elites . 
  so it 's named after the language , unlike many other countries , where the common name of country , language , and people stems from either the name of a tribe or the name of the country . 
  `` deutschland '' very literally means the land where that language `` deutsch '' is spoken , and afaik it was first used kind of like `` anglosphere '' today , so with no relationship to a political entity , but became sort of a `` nickname '' for the hre at some point . 
  note that when germany was unified in 1871 , they called it `` german empire '' , not `` germany '' , since the latter was still pretty much thought to include all german speakers , most notably the german speaking parts of austria . 
  english is actually interesting in this respect , since it picked up the same root as `` deutsch '' , but assigned it just to the `` germans '' closest to them and their language : the dutch . 
  the names in many languages stem from the german speakers they had most contact with -- the alemanns , the saxons , etc. , or derive from the latin `` germania '' , which was basically just their name for that weird `` savage '' country in the north they had trouble with every once in a while . 
  or the nice way the slavs thought of germans as mute , since they spoke such a weird language . 
  but in all fairness , germanic ( and some other ) languages ( including english ) derive the word for , well , slaves from slavs , so calling us mute was probably nicer than what we did to them . 
  yes , the verb `` poltern '' is used for `` making a noise '' like when something falls down or when you stumble over something . 
  so a poltergeist is a ghost who makes noise in your house that you ca n't otherwise explain . 
   do you think your government is doing enough to tackle it , and how are they proceeding ? 
  no , not really . 
  they still care too much about coal , for example , and they do n't want to put too much of a `` burden '' on industry , because they do n't want jobs to be moved out of the country . 
   is climate change denial prominent at all in your area ? 
  not really . 
  it 's kind of popular with the far-right , along with other conspiracy theories , but even there it 's advanced level bullshit . 
  along the lines of chemtrails . 
   how do you feel about climate change ? 
  i hope we can stop and reverse it , or at least limit the effects . 
  to a certain degree it 's happening and it 's too late to change , and even beyond that , capitalism is largely incompatible with combating climate change , and too few people dare to even talk about that fundamental problem . 
   what do you personally do ( if anything ) to be environmentally friendly ? 
  not really much . 
  there are a few small things you could count , i guess : * being vegan * trying to buy local and organic * avoiding heavily packaged products * not owning a car , using bike and public transportation instead * not using a plane when there 's an alternative ( like a train ) , flying only maybe once every couple of years * having 100 % renewable electricity ( from a 100 % renewable company , so they ca n't repackage ) * not buying a lot of new stuff , giving old stuff to a free shop instead of throwing it away if it 's still good * recycling things properly , putting everything in the right container . 
  i had hardly slept , and i swapped tajikistan and kyrgyzstan in my head . 
  i heard they 're pretty fond of germany there and modeled their constitution after ours . 
   is it true that german men sit to urinate i prefer to stand , but i only stand when there 's a urinal or when i 'm out in the woods . 
  at home i sit and i somewhat expect other men to sit , too . 
   and also that german toilets have shelves so you can inspect feces before flushing ? 
  yep . 
  not all of them but quite a few . 
  i actually prefer them , i do n't like the backsplash you get from dropping it directly into the water . 
  tbh i found american toilets difficult to get used to , because there is so much water that it splashs a lot -- i do n't like toilet water on my ass -- , and the shit floats around which is weird and felt kind of gross to me . 
  i much prefer the shelf . 
  it does n't mean i always carefully inspect my droppings , but a quick glance does n't hurt and can tell you a lot about what 's going well and not so well in your body . 
   how do you feel about bidets ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever used one . 
  they 're not popular . 
  i 'm actually not sure how it 's used correctly , so when somebody has one , my only thought is `` wow , they have one of those weird things in their bathroom '' . 
   well only one tsar ruled over estonia as they were renamed emperors from 1721 . 
  huh ? 
  is n't `` tsar '' just the russian word for emperor ? 
  well , the most important word is obviously \u00e7\u00fc\u015f ( `` whoa '' ) also spelled germanified as tsch\u00fcsch . 
  afaik it 's originally just a sound to make donkeys slow down , but came here through turkish . 
  usually it 's used like this : \u00c7\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u015f !, 
  well that is good to hear since i am primarily looking at a stem major . 
  would most schools have similar practices across germany as long as they 're * somewhat * used to foreign students ? 
  i would assume so . 
  check the formal requirements though . 
  those are the hard limits . 
  check if your high school diploma is already equivalent to abitur ( the sort of diploma you need to enter any university ) or if you have to go to a studienkolleg first . 
  if the german language requirement is b1 , it 's certainly doable , if it 's c1 , that 's significantly harder . 
   huh . 
  that seems odd . 
  it 's a very different focus on what 's important in a school . 
  get used to things being `` odd '' . 
  that 's what being in a different country means . 
  universities are all basically the same quality because they are not competing for the best paying `` customers '' ( or for anything , really ) . 
  also , university is much less about `` general education '' than in the us . 
  you wo n't be required to do courses that are n't related to your field of study . 
  that 's why the difference between majors matters so much more . 
  it 's not one subject you learn about a little more than the others , it 's the one thing that 90 % of your classes will revolve around . 
  well , i have tutored first semester computer science students for a few semesters , and some of the foreign students did n't speak great german . 
  when grading the exams , we 'd just accept english answers or answers in german with completely messed up grammar and spelling , as long as we could understand it . 
  they still needed to understand the exercises , though . 
  not saying it was n't tough for them , but in a stem field , definitely manageable . 
  however , i guess if you 'd go into humanities , it would be significantly harder without very good german knowledge . 
  one thing that is pretty different : in germany ( do n't know about the rest of europe ) , picking your `` major '' ( or program or whatever you want to call it ) is more important than in the us , and the name of the university is less important . 
  you apply for a specific major , and the same university will accept all applicants for , say , math as long as they fulfill the formal criteria , but will only take the best of the best for , say , medicine . 
  but generally all universities will have about the same requirements one subject , it 's not significantly harder to get into one university than to get into any other . 
  i 'd say if you spend a year of learning the language ( almost ) full time ( or at least several hours a day , every day ) , and maybe move a few months before the semester starts ( i do n't know how the visa stuff works exactly ) and take lessons and live in a flatshare with germans , you probably wo n't have any major language problems . 
  yes . 
  except in the areas where it becomes isch ( in the southwest ) . 
  we do n't have a culture of bar fighting that i 'm aware of . 
  if someone kept annoying the customers by saying offensive things , the staff would probably make them leave . 
  tbh i have n't met that many americans at uni . 
  foreign students ( from outside of the eu ) were mostly chinese , middle eastern , or indian . 
  the elephant in the room is language . 
  are you prepared to learn a new language well enough to follow lectures and pass both written and oral exams ? 
  most countries in europe are not english speaking and undergraduate programs are almost exclusively in the local language , obviously . 
  but yeah , if you do n't mind learning german and being responsible for your own studying ( expect zero hand holding , nobody except yourself will care if you skip classes and fail ) , i do n't think you 'd regret it later . 
   mandatory for everyone . 
  i do n't think it is though . 
  iirc you need at least one modern foreign language , but i do n't think there 's a rule it has to be english . 
  it might depend on the state though .
