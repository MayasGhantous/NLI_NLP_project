  they feel like they * should * understand it , because it 's something you learn in school , like math or other mandatory subjects . 
  it can probably feel weird as a native english speakers , because it always feels to me and possibly other non-native english speakers like they 're being lazy or arrogant for making everybody use a foreign language for communication while they just talk in their own native language . 
  it feels like they 're making us do them a favor all the time and not really giving anything in return . 
  it 's different from using english with another non-native english speaker , where it serves as a tool and is n't the `` most comfortable '' thing for both sides , so they 're more equal . 
  i know it 's not the individual english speaker 's fault , and there 's nothing they can do about it ( besides learning one or two other languages , but there 's no other lingua franca so it 's not the same ) . 
  so if you feel bad about just knowing one language , why not learn one or two others ? 
  it 's hard but not impossible , we 've all done it and so can you !, 
  can confirm . 
  being vegan in berlin is extremely simple , there are even tons of completely vegan restaurants , and in many others you have good options too , not just side dishes or fries . 
  depends on the neighborhood though , but the `` hip '' areas where lots of students and hipsters live and go out , you can basically walk into any restaurant and have a decent vegan meal . 
  also frank is quite common , i think i 've also heard sachs . 
  but also other countries : * englisch * b\u00f6hm , tschech * schweizer, 
  they are truly dead in the way that they are n't used for communication , neither written nor spoken , but they 're still important for reading old original sources . 
  not too long ago ( 100 years maybe , at most 200 ) , it was still sort of common to publish scientific works in latin . 
  a few decades ago latin was still used quite a bit in the catholic church , for rituals and fixed lines and the like . 
  in theory , latin is still the language of the vatican , but i think even there they do most things in italian these days . 
  i think it depends on the speaker , some make the exact sound . 
  also a lot of english speakers use that sound for the h in words like hue , huge , human . 
  well , augsburg has a swabian dialect with bavarian influences , tirol mostly has a bavarian dialect with swabian/alemanic influences , so it makes sense that it 's not too far off , 
  of course . 
  everybody knows that it 's pronounced as augschprrk . 
  a surprising amount of people have trouble with * serviette * ( napkin ) . 
  i 've heard * servette * and * servierte * quite often . 
  he 's pulling your leg . 
  in german , different dialects pronounce g differently in final position ( at the end of a syllable/word ) . 
  in the south , it gets hardened to a k sound ( german hardens all final consonants ) , while in the north , it becomes a ch sound ( there are two of those , one is like english ** h ** ue , the other one is similar to scottish lo ** ch ** ) . 
  in standard german pronunciation , it 's pronounced as a ch only after i , but since the redditor is from hamburg ( north ) , they pronounce it as hamburch . 
  edit : but in both pronunciations , all letters are pronounced , so the standard one would be ( in approximated english spelling ) boork . 
  interesting . 
  i noticed a quite a few northern germans having trouble with those two , and assumed it 's because they do n't exist in lower german , so the distinction never really made it into colloquial speech . 
  i 'm from southern germany , and it feels really weird to me when those two are n't obvious to someone , since in my dialect they 're very different . 
  i assumed it 's the mostly same in austria . 
  in my dialect , genitive does n't exist , so i did n't use it in colloquial speech when i still lived in the area . 
  it still feels weird to me when people use genitive after * trotz * . 
  i mean , i know it 's formally correct , but only because of overcorrection and people trying to be fancy . 
  originally it was dative , that 's why we say * trotzdem * . 
  it 's not that it 's really that important in everyday life , you 're just expected to know it because it 's mandatory in school . 
  like you 'd expect people to know at least basic math . 
  it 's okay if you 're not good at it and if you 've forgot quite a bit , but * everybody * is expected to know the basics . 
  for the older generation it 's not so important , because in most jobs you do n't really need it . 
  but even the older generation learned at least one foreign language in school , english in the west , russian in the east . 
  foreign languages have been part of the core subjects in school for a long time , and you ca n't get abitur ( the sort of high school diploma that lets you go to university ) without having learned at least two of them . 
  the thought that in some countries people see foreign languages as an optional or less important part of education is pretty foreign to us . 
  i think it 's pretty common in certain contexts to use the name of the capital instead of the country . 
  it 's pretty annoying though . 
  in german media , when they talk about `` berlin politics '' , one can never know if they mean the state of berlin or the federal government . 
  well , the long e sound used in german does n't exist in english , so they often turn it into some * ey * diphthong which sounds pretty weird . 
  maybe that 's another thing that makes their pronunciation fo * schnee * weird . 
  i never noticed the * tsch * thing , and it 's the same basic sound as * ch * in english , so i ca n't imagine that it 's that hard for most english speakers . 
  but in `` tsch\u00fcss '' , there 's an \u00fc which they generally struggle with , which may make the word as a whole sound somewhat weird . 
  in theory i think you 're right , but in practice both are used and german speakers will probably have a hard time even hearing the difference . 
  its more of a personal or dialectal variety than a completely different sound to us . 
  interesting . 
  some german speakers pronounce eu similar to that , although for most it sounds more like \u00f6\u00fc , o\u00fc , or oi . 
   which lead to words like schnee and tsch\u00fcss coming out as `` shnee '' and `` t-shuess '' . 
  i do n't get what you mean by that . 
  i have n't noticed a difference between german sch and english sh so far , does that mean i have a weird accent in english ? 
  when you learn a language , you 're going to have a slight foreign accent anyway . 
  even native speakers have local accents . 
  they 're not a problem at all as long as people understand you . 
  and in german , the way you pronounce the r is probably the single least important thing to worry about in terms of pronunciation . 
  some learners waste a lot of time practicing their r , while their vowels are still complete shit and because of that it 's really hard to understand them . 
  it 's important to stress that fact , because some learners seem to have that weird obsession with perfecting their r , which helps them not a single bit in improving their german language skills in any way . 
  another one that english speakers seem to have huge troubles with is \u00fc , and many pronounce it like u , which sounds really odd . 
  if you ca n't make that sound , do an i instead , it 's closer to the correct sound , and even native speakers do it in quite a few dialects . 
  same thing with \u00f6 , which sounds closer to e than to o. 
   a major thing being that his mother had to make frequent trips down to the cellar to collect coal to light the furnace in the apartment so they would have hot water . 
  this was back in the 1980s . 
  that 's only partly an eastern thing , inner city houses are just old , and many had n't been renovated by then . 
  some people in the west had to do the same thing . 
  east germany mainly invested in new huge blocks and kind of let the old houses rot , so it was still more common in the 80s . 
  part of my family is from silesia . 
  my grandparents stayed there at first after the war , but then made the move to west germany in the late 50s . 
  afaik some distant relatives of mine still live there . 
  it stems from old 19th century currency called [ vereinstaler ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/vereinstaler ) . 
  so after the mark was introduced , the new 10 pfennig coins had the exact same value that was formerly known as groschen , and i think the old groschen coins could be used as 10 pfennig coins for a few years . 
  yeah , i live together with my girlfriend and our child and we do n't plan on marrying . 
  my sister does the same thing . 
  generally a lot of people in the younger generation are either indifferent or opposed to marriage . 
  some get married for the tax benefits . 
  i 'm hoping that those benefits will be adapted so they go to households with children , without considering marital status . 
  politicians talk about that a lot , so it might happen within the next few years . 
  i do n't want to get married but i would n't mind getting tax benefits . 
  i would say part of the reason why a lot of young people do n't want to get married is because of the ideas associated with it : religion , not having sex with anyone else , staying together with only that one same partner for the whole life , etc. 
  my grandparents ' generation still lived those ideas , in that generation there are also many people who believe in god and such . 
  my parents ' generation sort of seemed to try to live like that , too , but as a whole , they failed dramatically . 
  most of them are divorced , some remarried , and while they generally know that god does n't exist they still stay in church because of tradition . 
  my generation seems to not want to live that kind of lie , at least i do n't . 
  tbh , i would n't mind marriage if it were just for the legal status , but i am appalled by the whole tradition , romanticism , monogamy , etc. 
  that 's generally associated with it . 
  if germany had civil unions for mixed gender couples ( like france ) i would probably consider it . 
  no , not really , at least not to the same extend . 
  in the case of germany , summer vacation in schools is about six weeks ( not several months ) , and there are shorter vacation periods spread all over the year . 
  the minimum legal amount of paid vacation for employees is four weeks , but the average is about six weeks . 
  so in general , families just go on family vacation together and there 's no need to send the kids away alone . 
   certain products are banned for sale and companies will get fined for selling them like in every country in the world . 
  the whole issue with google is interesting , and so i was interested when i saw the title , but your post is garbage , sorry . 
  i do n't think it 's so much about left/right power sharing ( we sort of have that in our current grand coalition ) , but basically a third model that is different from the presidential and the parliamentary system . 
  i like the idea a lot . 
  in a presidential system , there is too much power held by a single person ( the president ) .
