thought it was hellas or something . 
  i do n't really think germany 's population will decrease that much . . and in 2012 or so there actually was a slight increase again ( mostly because of the immigrants ) . 
  it could stay roughly the same after few decades . 
  or yeah , less than 80 or 75 . . who knows ? 
  anything could happen . 
  the color of the circle seems dark brown to me ( 2000-2014 ) edit : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_by_country_or_territory#southern_europe since 2001 legal, 
  does n't seem like it , it 's high up there though . 
  but in terms of road density it sure is at the top , perhaps you meant that . . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oecd_countries_by_road_network_size, 
  yeah , all over 20 million of them . 
  do n't generalize . 
  yeah . . which ( western ) country does n't ? 
  and if you are still being sarcastic then perhaps you should work on it . 
   l\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich  umsatzsteuervorwegausgleich you are n't making up these words , are n't you ? 
  even though german is my native language and i know all about how long those compunds words can be . 
  yeah , otherwise fc barcelona would dominate in the catalonian league if there would be one and that 'd be pretty onesided and boring . 
  they already are doing great in the la liga this season ( 6 games , 5 wins , 17-0 goals ), 
  yeah , it 's really pathetic that we have to deal with such crap . 
  ( i think it would work if there are less than 500 viewers or if it 's hosted by a channel from germany ), 
  i do n't use facebook anymore ( have only used it for a very short time ) and neither do many of my friends . 
  i wonder if it will change in like 5 years or if it will grow even bigger ? 
   ** germany ** 18 . 
  xhamster.com well . . 
  or just hover the cursor over the flag and popup will appear with the name . . of course it wo n't be useful with custom text like op has ( that country you do n't care about ) . 
  also that inspect element feature is in firefox as well . 
  singapore . 
  but my first choice would be canada , too, 
  good point , and yeah i was n't being serious . 
  it 's also 80 million people . 
  deutschland : yes , just for fun and madness . 
  i 'd like to see germany being dissolved in states like before the first unification in 1871 . 
  but in reality ? 
  hell , no . 
  even bavaria should stay in germany because it 's an important part , both economically and culturally . 
  yes , same link but one is `` modified '' and bypasses the age gate, 
  they are used to it and rather want hear the dialogue in their native language . . and some dislike subtitles . 
  not me though , i wish my country was one of the blue countries on the map . 
  xrel.to has german releases and you can google them for download or stream links ( like on movie4k ), 
   the other big part being that we 're taught english in school from the 4th grade . 
  so are they in germany . 
  since 3rd grade ( or fifth until several years ago ) . 
  still , all movies and shows are dubbed : /, 
  what is the m/d/y date format doing here , op ? 
  the south and north ? 
  because nrw fits perfectly here, 
  so . . drugs are a thing in hamburg ? 
  ( i am new to this city ), 
  for some regions there are way more than 10 million people . . like in some in germany and other countries . 
  as mentioned there are specific subreddits like / r/ukrainianconflict or the russia and ukraine subreddits, 
  and that long , weird spelling name . . bardabunga . 
  at least not as bad as ejafijaki\u00f6ll or whatever, 
  1000 lbs = 450 kg 65 ft = 20 meters 22 miles = 35 km, 
  the population density ? 
  the availability of the data in those areas , streets etc on openstreet map, 
  but then hamburg would n't be at the top anymore : /, 
  * spacecfraft, 
  i think that 's the point . . unless it was not intended . 
  ber asjo najka suwer skaop nemeao lapop ( kauderwelsh , nth language - made up just now ), 
  just now in hamburg at 4:30 in the morning . . http://i.imgur.com/mohscw3.jpg edit : 2 hours later http://i.imgur.com/kecxf2g.jpg, 
  it obviously was a joke . . but other than that these are really neat . 
  sorry you do n't like it . 
  daaamn . . thought it would be like 400 , 500 m . but over 1 km ? 
  holy . . dude , what ? 
  would be the tallest of the world . 
  it 's on both continents . . or were you making a joke ? 
  a large part of the population and the central hub of russia is in europe anyways . 
   ( which is n't going to stand past 2040 ) wait . . why is that ? 
  also lot of things can happen in the next decades , so that there could be buildings higher than the churches . 
  kinda hard to imagine otherwise in like the 22nd century or later . 
  then again it would n't be so surprising if the regulation still holds . 
  same for german speakers . . altough it 's not that much more i guess . 
  but definitely way more than just under 80m french speakers . 
  i guess they do n't count the ones outside of europe . 
  til buses is also a correct term . 
  thought it was busses with two s but apparently it 's just in american english . 
  or in like lots of other big cities, 
  in [ hamburg ] ( http://www.bus-bild.de/bilder/vanhool-xxl-bus-8713-auf-metro-31868.jpg ) as well . . yeah , those drive on main roads only . 
  german efficiency !, 
  neither it 's related to the other countries yet it was there . . not really odd . 
  we all know that american football is way more popular than regular football ( or soccer as you call it ) in the us . 
  for every match there was a special google doodle even though germany did n't take part in it . 
  of course when germany played there was a doodle as well . 
  just check out the link i posted above and scroll through them . 
  i thought it was funny as i saw it . 
  or the little mermaid in copenhagen . . 
  the logo was also shown in my country . . and many others . 
  but it 's weird that it was n't in the uk though according to this : http://www.google.com/doodles/world-cup-2014-47 ( but of course a gif is better . 
  thanks ), 
  how many has the us for comparison ? 
  i know that it probably differes from state to state but in average ? 
  but i guess i just could use google, 
  dar el cu siguran\u021b\u0103 va fi trimis mai t\u00e2rziu \u00een joc there is n't really a special word for einwechseln . . either it 's exchange or to send . 
  what do you think , will germany struggle against ghana or will they win this game easily like against portugal ? 
  also do you actually want more and more european teams out of this world cup so that it would be more interesting ? 
  i remember that in the last wc in the semi finals there were only european teams . 
  because we do n't use imperial here in europe , duh, 
  that should be obvious but a speed limit of 180 is just . . very unheard of . 
  it might as well no speed limit then in this case . 
  if there is one then the highest is 130 , i think . 
  no seriously , i mean the speed limit of 180 km/h . . pretty sure there is no such sign for that unless you can prove otherwise ? 
   sometimes 180km/h & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; where did you got that from ?
