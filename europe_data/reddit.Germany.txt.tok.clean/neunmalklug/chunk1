the post is from r/germany , a sub for tourists , foreigners , expats and people who are unable to find the place actual german speakers are . 
  [ well , place 4 is pretty german . 
   once you find a similar group with a similar desire for `` pure genes '' having a similar relevance in your country of choice , have fun copying that video . 
  well , apparently shitposting on twitter and writing for the `` deutschland kurier '' is n't enough to keep her busy . 
  if this is so obvious , why do n't you just provide proof , or at least evidence ? 
  it was their most successful action in germany . 
  i 'll give you that . 
  but that `` glory '' has been overshadowed by their later actions , revelations about the members ( lots of ( former ) neo-nazis ) or their other recent interactions with the law . 
  my point is : that action was neither clever nor new . 
  and it is n't that much of a propaganda success as you make it out to be . 
  russian troll wages sadly ca n't compete with the benefits i get via antifa e.v. 
  premium heath insurance , a bonus `` get out of jail for free '' - card every chanukka , a personal birthday card signed by soros himself . 
  also 600 $ for each demonstration i visit . 
  and as antifa e.v is a subsidiary of the brd gmbh it 's way easier to get into one of these high paying state media jobs . 
  where you do n't have to do any real work and just have to proclaim what `` they '' put on your desk in the morning . 
  that joke does n't really work in a different context . 
  it is making fun of german white supremacist and their desire for `` pure germans '' . 
  once you find a similar group with a similar desire for `` pure genes '' having a similar relevance in your country of choice , have fun copying that video . 
  why should i ? 
  usually people provide evidence when they want other people to believe something . 
  but hey , congratulations to them for using two ladders without falling down . 
  - and i 'm sure nobody would have reported on the ngos without these brave identitarians ... 
  so you just claim it , but ca n't prove it . 
  well , then . 
  does the swedish government have editorial control over svt ? 
  if the answer is no , it 's not state media . 
  - the german government and staate have no editorial control over their public broadcasters , they are not even handling the fees ( rundfunkgeb\u00fchren ) . 
  hence they are public broadcasters and not state media . 
  ard and zdf are public broadcasters . 
  quite similar to the bbc or the swedish svt . 
  my comment is unrelated to that what the top level comment said . 
  but : the video is making fun of white/german supremacy . 
  not white people . 
  or germans . 
  is there any hint that there could be a black superiority movement in germany ? 
  give them a call if you found it . 
  wait , so ben carson is n't black ? 
  because if i remember correctly he was ridiculed quite a lot . 
  even by these pesky leftist comedians . 
  well , does brown hair count ? 
  the main author is the male ranger in the video . 
   if the video does so in a funny way is on another page . 
  i think part of the goal of this video was trigger a certain demographic . 
  and judging by ( some ) comments on here and on facebook that has been archived . 
  apparently quite a lot of people ca n't take a joke . 
  they 've made a name here in germany for such successful actions : they tried to climb on the roof of the ministry of justice , but police stopped them . 
  they settled for [ `` blocking '' ] ( https://twitter.com/letkiser/status/865700388917456897 ) it . 
  ( the man in with the white shirt and the water bottles is the minister of justice . ), 
  [ they tried to block the party headquarters of the cdu in berlin ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/438/31811163722_fe4f4f8a25_b.jpg ) ... at night . 
   the author should send a gift basket to them because der spiegel is responsible for all the publicity . 
  the author is dead , but [ g\u00f6tz kubizscheck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%b6tz_kubitschek ) might very well send one over . 
  no worries , we can deal with those sauprei\u00dfen . 
  excluding turkey from the hermes export guarantees would make it less attractive for german companies to export there . 
  these guarantees are basically an insurance for the case that the buyer is n't paying . 
  this has been announced as a frist step that will be taken if things do n't improve . 
  i 'm multilingual . 
  kloana . 
  yeah , sure ... they lost their mind just now , and will be swiftly replaced as it basically happens every election since 1957 . 
  it 's not that this was a quality tv show . 
  please do n't judge us by our private tv stations . 
  our public broadcasters can afford translators or journalists that speak dutch . 
  or proper journalists in the first place . 
  because the article i translated was already posted in r/de ? 
   and it would n't be the first time that germany got hacked : in may 2015 hackers stole data from 16 members of the bundestag , or parliament , including mrs. merkel , who holds a seat there . 
  yeah , about that : it was merkel 's constituency office , not the office of the chancellor that got hacked , so that 's not really that much reason for concern . 
  also :  the office for information security [ bsi ] team tried to save what could be saved , but their work also made it clear just how ill-prepared the bundestag had been in the face of the dangers of the digital age -- and how poorly german agencies worked together . 
   the bsi maintains a black list including some 160,000 servers around the world that have been identified as dangerous . 
  but because the bsi is only responsible for the executive branch 's computer system , and not for the parliamentary network , it had not forwarded this list on to the bundestag -- a step that was only taken months after the attack . 
  bundestag technicians also maintained a black list , but it only included some 5,000 servers . 
  information pertaining to suspicious servers , complains the responsible division head in the bundestag administration , `` only reaches the bundestag late or not at all . '', 
  -  as it would later become clear , the bsi was even familiar with the server the hackers had used . 
  on april 13 , two weeks before the attack on the bundestag , the agency had blocked all data originating from the server . 
  that move protected the executive branch , but not the bundestag . 
  if the authorities had contacted each other earlier , the attack could have been prevented . 
  from [ `` merkel and the fancy bear '' ] ( http://www.zeit.de/digital/2017-05/cyberattack-bundestag-angela-merkel-fancy-bear-hacker-russia/komplettansicht ) , a report about the hack and how it 's been dealt with . 
  turns out i fell for a load of bull crap in r/germany . 
  give me some time and let me read a bit more in the [ actual study ] ( https://www.otto-brenner-shop.de/uploads/tx_mplightshop/ah_93_haller_web.pdf ) . 
  [ pdf in german ], 
  i 've already posted that in r/germany , but might add it here as well : the study seems to be of questionable value ** to make the point it 's supposed to make here ** . 
  die zeit was able to see it in advance : the study included frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung , die welt , bild as well as regional daily newspapers , but no weekly newspapers ( as die zeit ) , tv news ( tagesschau , heute journal ) or radio . 
  * while the study acknowledges that the faz had `` many '' opinion pieces that were critical of the unlimited acceptance of refugees , they still count that paper as one of the shouters in the dreary echo chamber . 
  * according to the study itself , it excluded the texts of guest authors that were critical of merkel 's refugee policy . 
  [ ... ] haller [ one of the authors of the study ] justified that because readers would n't ascribe those to the editorial team of the newspaper . 
  * [ source in german ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2017/30/fluechtlinge-medien-berichterstattung-studie/komplettansicht ) especially that last part seems like a load of bull carp to me , ** if you want to make this about the coverage of the german media in general . 
  the study is actually more nuanced and researched only the reporting of the factual parts in a few selected , but popular newspapers . 
  in this case it actually makes a lot of sense to exclude opinion pieces . 
  ** edit in bold . 
  you can find the study [ here ] ( https://www.otto-brenner-shop.de/uploads/tx_mplightshop/ah_93_haller_web.pdf ) [ pdf in german ] also interesting : [ \u00dcbermedien about the medial reception of the study ] ( http://uebermedien.de/18070/alles-versager-die-mediale-sturzgeburt-einer-studie/ ) [ german ] tldr : it is n't that easy and `` german media failed to report refugee crisis honestly '' is definitely not the result of the study . 
  the result of her party was pretty good , but their former coalition partner did n't make it past the 5 % threshold . 
  spd , greens and left could have formed a government against her , so there is certainly reason for celebration , but merkel was also looking at a potential defeat . 
  that is only part of the explanation . 
  the other is that merkel grew up in the gdr where the party was the staate . 
  as head of the cdu she tries to separate those two . 
  this was a party event and she was there as the head of her party , not as an official of the federal republic . 
  in her role a chancellor she 's no more an no less often seen with a german flag than other chancellors or other western european heads of government . 
   if the origins of germany 's tricolor flag are not widely known , that is because the banner is rarely displayed in a country still atoning for the crimes it carried out in the name of national pride . 
  what about the swedes , norwegians or brazilians who are not aware of the origins of their flag ? 
  same reason , or what ? 
  also inb4 foreigners tell me how much i have to love my country ... 
  i understood you .
