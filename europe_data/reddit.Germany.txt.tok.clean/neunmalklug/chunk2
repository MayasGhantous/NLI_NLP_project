  look at the polls . 
  the spd is at ~ 25 % , greens at 8 % , left at 9 % , leaving them combined at ~ 42 % , which is n't enough . 
  especially as afd and fdp seem to make it the bundestag as well . 
  no one 's willing to form a coalition with the afd , so that leaves us with a cdu/csu + fdp coalition as the most likely outcome . 
   the name `` merkel '' is nowhere to be found on the ballot . 
  well it is , at least for about 245.000 people in merkel 's district , which she as won since it it was created in 1990 . 
  at the moment ? 
  yes , at least if you meant as junior partner in a grand coalition under merkel . 
  other than that ... it 's more likely that cdu/csu are strong to govern alone ... 
  here are the recent polls : http://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/index.htm, 
  shift + altgr + \u00df, 
  if you have a german keyboard and windows use shift + altgr + \u00df to get your own \u1e9e . 
  if not take your free \u1e9e here : \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e \u1e9e, 
  not at all i 'd guess . 
  on the german qwertz keyboard the \u1e9e is already included , at least on windows : shift + altgr + \u00df and of course we need the \u1e9e . 
  how am i supposed to write all the nouns that start with it ? 
   violence is justifiable in self defence or retaliation . 
   identitarians are n't violent towards regular civilians who disagree with them , unlike the police and antifa who will arrest/beat people for having the wrong opinion or liking the wrong facebook comment . 
  so your ( strawman ) antifa and ib are pretty close after all . 
  why the hell do i try to discuss with people who post on / r/physical _ removal ? 
   identitarians are anti war well , we 've seen their stance on violence in june in berlin : https://twitter.com/jfda_ev/status/876163040345042944, 
  first of all : nazis = / = neonazis . 
  sure , they are n't your local run of the mill neonazi skinhead , but their personnel and their message is hardly different . 
  ( some of them are the same people after all ) they may not scream `` foreigners out ! '', 
  but will use `` remigration '' which means the same , just sounds more intellectual . 
  edit : typo . 
  i do n't know much about the austrian or french members of the gi/ib , but the german identit\u00e4re bewegung heavily recruited ( former ) neonazis , npd youth or members of radical fraternities :  the identitarians are n't a movement , their dissociation of the right scene is tactical . 
  their leadership comes from the npd youth , from radical fraterniteis or from the outlawed neonazi organisation heimattreue deutsche jugend ( hdj ) . 
  the identitarians offer them a fresh corporate identity , under which they can regulate their old objectives . 
  in thuringia for example two thirds had a `` right wing extremistic forerun '' said markus lutterbeck , head of the department right-wing extremism at the staate office for the protection of the constitution [ landesamt f\u00fcr verfassungsschutz ] [ source in german ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2017-04/identitaere-bewegung-rechtsextremismus-neonazis-mitglieder/komplettansicht ) the hdj , a now outlawed group , that was not only similar to the hitler youth ( hj ) by name , but also by nature . 
  - so all in all , `` hipster nazis '' seems a bit closer to the truth . 
  edit : changed `` former '' to '' ( former ) '', 
  yes . 
  because all 82 million of us were rioting in hamburg tonight . 
  she grew up in the gdr , putin was as a kgb agent stationed in dresden for about 5 years until the wall fell . 
  what they missed : the current host is always in the middle , accompanied by the previous and next host of the g-20 meetings . 
  that 's why merkel was in the centre last time as well . 
  she 's fluent , at least she was as a student . 
  she grew up in the gdr after all :  at school , she learned to speak russian fluently , and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in russian and mathematics . 
   no , no . 
  we do n't have soldiers in ukraine . 
  the 're just on holiday . 
  the g-20 is a magnet for shit heads and the police was happily playing along the last few days as they escalated the fuck out of minor offences that would be tolerated in other demonstrations , in other cities , or on other occasions . 
  few days ago police raided a legal protest camp and confiscated 11 sleeping tents , for no good reason . 
  i 'm not trying to excuse violence here , but it 's seemed to me that the police tactics today made matters worse . 
  it is ? 
  that was in 2015 during the refugee crisis . 
  the whole quote is a lot more nuanced , but while those three words were quoted 5000 times in german newspapers , it was only 15 times in context and only once quoted completely . 
  -  * germany is a strong country . 
  the motive in which we have to approach these things has to be : we 've done * ( meaning accomplished ) * so much - we can do it . 
  erdo should look up what journalism means :  ** erdo\u011fan : ** [ ... ]  then there is -- and german chancellor angela merkel has been deeply preoccupied with him -- deniz y\u00fccel . 
  on feb. 27 , 2017 , he was accused by the 9th istanbul criminal court of openly inciting the public to hatred and hostility , and of conducting propaganda on behalf of a terror organization , and he was arrested . 
  on march 8 , 9 and 22 , on april 12 and 17 , and on may 9 , 2017 , he was examined by a doctor . 
  public prosecutors in istanbul have discovered that deniz y\u00fccel spoke with one of the pkk leaders in the qandil mountains , that he participated in meetings organized by the pkk , and that he conducted propaganda on behalf of the separatist terror organization . 
  [ ... ]  ** zeit : ** in my career , i too have interviewed right-wing and left-wing terrorists in addition to people suspected of terrorism . 
  do you believe that those who do such things as a journalist are terrorists , or supporters of terrorists , themselves ? 
   ** erdo\u011fan : ** in my opinion , such a person is a supporter of terrorists because he knows that this person is a terrorist . 
  what do you want to talk about with a terrorist ? 
  and where do you want to publish it ? 
  if you publish the thoughts of a terrorist in your publication , what is that ? 
  that is the publishing of terrorism itself . 
  by doing so , you are abetting the propaganda of the terrorists . 
  that is how it is seen by courts around the world , because they say : that is aiding and abetting the thoughts of terrorists , and that is a crime . 
  other than that , another interesting interview by die zeit and well worth the read if you 're interested german turkish relations . 
  well , to be fair , it could have been worse . 
  the [ stadtschloss in berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_palace,_berlin ) was demolished and replaced with '' [ erich 's asbestos palace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_republic,_berlin ) '' it 's currently being rebuild as [ humboldtforum ] ( https://files1.structurae.de/files/350high/5256/2017-02-16/dsc05174.jpg ) . 
  the frauenkirche itself did n't look much different in [ 1990 ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/30162527.jpg ) . 
   but whitehall sources confirmed the government had now been warned that the president could visit turnberry , his golf resort in scotland , during his trip to europe , between attending the g20 summit in hamburg next weekend and joining celebrations for bastille day in france on 14 july . 
   trump would be expected to come to downing street to meet the prime minister for informal talks as part of any such visit , though final confirmation would be likely to be given with just 24 hours ' notice to minimise the risk of disruption . 
  of course he 's visiting his golf resort . 
  it would be more than surprising if he could bother doing his job for more than a week without having a small golf break ... and why should he pass on earning himself some money ? 
  yep , [ this ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/30162527.jpg ) is how the placed looked in 1990 . 
  no worries , he got his german flag later on : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6kn8py/the_flag_of_europe_adorning_the_casket_of_former/djnstzp/, 
  means it 's reserved for officials like the president , the army and other federal institutions . 
  probably a pretty old tradition ... 
  the [ zdf stream ( starting 2:30:00 , might be geo-blocked ) ] ( https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/zdfspezial/170701-traueraktkohl-spz-102.html ) seemed fine to me . 
  video feed is the same , but apparently the zdf 's audio department is better . 
  well , abolishing roaming fees was a recent smaller victory . 
  but just as the euro or the common travel area , those are things that have little significance for people who rarely travel out of their country . 
  ( one of the reasons i like the idea with the free or at least discounted interrail tickets for young adults ) things like [ privacy shield ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu-us_privacy_shield ) are almost unknown , even to those who do use the internet regularly . 
  the eu does a whole lot of stuff , but is apparently terrible at communicating it to those demographics that are n't directly affected . 
  his casket was draped in the german bundesdienstflagge by the time they arrived in germany : [ aboard the ms mainz ] ( http://bilder.bild.de/fotos-skaliert/der-sarg-mit-dem-leichnam-helmut-kohls-ist-auf-der-ms-mainz-aufgebahrt-rheinaufwaerts-geht-es-nach--200436432-52403486/2,w=756,q=high,c=0.bild.jpg ) [ at the dome of speyer ] ( http://media0.faz.net/ppmedia/aktuell/gesellschaft/4069716036/1.5087048/article_multimedia_overview/maike-kohl-richter-folgt-dem.jpg ), 
  he 's way too busy to give speech for some old dead dude ... have n't you seen how busy he is fulfilling important presidential duties like signing random slips of paper , shit talking on twitter and feuding with some tv show ? 
  btw : was there an official reaction to the whole kohl thing from the white house at all ? 
   ~ ~ holy roman ~ ~ german empire it was completed in 1894 . 
  the federal council is for representatives from the states . 
  the distance really cuts down on the pencil stabbing between the different state governments . 
  the whole thing looks a like a swimming pool ... 
  it 's not that this is necessarily merkel 's opinion , it 's just that the hardcore conservative wing of her party needed that bit of reassurance . 
  merkel 's strategy is to piss of the least amount of people possible . 
  that 's what we 've seen again today : the pro-camp is happy that they confirmed the law and will forget about her vote by next week , the against camp is somewhat happy merkel stood by her party 's hardcore conservative base . 
  most of the holidays are universal ( christmas , new year , easter , labour day , 3rd . 
  october ) , the difference is due to some religious holidays like assumption of mary , reformation day eg . 
  and apparently there are more of them in the catholic leaning south , than in the protestant leaning north or the former gdr . 
   the law was first created in 2004 and strengthened further ten years later , in 2014 , by the bundestag . 
  nothing new . 
  it 's just that media and police usually do n't report suicides to prevent the so called [ werther effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copycat_suicide ) . 
  apparently that case required them to mention that such a law exists . 
  in short : 1 : i wrote shitting , not criticising . 
  and yes , i 'd expect a chinese minister or any other minister to bring some actual arguments .
