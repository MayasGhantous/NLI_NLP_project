  2 : common courtesy would demand that . 
  especially in a 10 minute speech . 
  3 : i ca n't say that i 'm convinced by what i 've heard of him . 
  you do have trouble reading ? 
  do n't you ? 
   `` pretty sure every german here is informed on such matters . '', 
  so `` high ranking politicians , other officials , business leaders and academics '' are `` every german '' ? 
  thanks for the compliment , but that is n't something i could agree on . 
  -  pretty sure no one remotely qualified for international politics would ever criticize german trade policy . 
  you 're taking me out of context here . 
  it 's the combination of exceeding the time limit you agreed to by 150 % while bringing `` nothing new '' ( quote from our ministry of economy ) to the table . 
  in regard to the criticism : it 's been widely regarded as either unfounded , ignorant or even wrong : [ deka bank chief on that .

  ] ( http://www.npr.org/2017/05/30/530747971/trump-is-worried-about-the-trade-deficit-with-germany-he-shouldnt-be ) - also , this was n't a staate visit , official meeting on staate level or anything else , just a private meeting from a political party . 
  in other settings or on his own , sec . 
  ross is welcome to speak as long as he pleases and be as boring as he can . 
  just do n't expect our politicians to wast their time . 
  the land where companies are people is < - that way ... 
   i doubt many people there had any knowledge of secretary ross 's credentials . 
  i do somehow get the impression you think this was some sort of campaign rally , with the riff-raff from the street invited ... 
  the wirtschaftstag is a congress for high ranking politicians , other officials , business leaders and academics . 
  pretty sure those people are informed on such matters . 
  it 's part of their job after all . 
   there 's just a large disparity between power and how we 're treated maybe , just maybe that has to do with the way you ( meaning your government ) act ? 
  the current administration ( not just the president , but also his cabinet and their assistants ) seems unable to gasp the concept of trade deals with the eu , is n't really sure how nato works and embarraes itself with lies basicially every other day . 
  if you act like a fool , expert to be treated like one if patience of you counterparts runs out . 
  this was n't an official conference . 
  it was a private conference of merkel 's party . 
  he overstepped his time limit by 150 % . 
  while shitting on our trade surplus . 
  i do n't think a chinese minister would do that . 
  i do n't think anyone remotely qualified for international politics would do that . 
  does it ? 
  he was asked to speak about 10 minutes . 
  they cut the feed after 25 . 
  he apparently `` spoke a bit slowly '' and his speech `` contained nothing new '' . 
  [ bloomberg has few more details . 
  ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/trump-s-commerce-chief-cut-off-in-berlin-as-german-patience-ends ) btw : this is a non story in germany . 
  we had civil unions since 2001 . 
  those guaranteed similar , but not equal rights . 
  especially regarding adoptions and financial matters , although some court rulings made the two more similar over the years . 
  yes , otherwise there would n't really be a difference to the civil union we had before . 
  it 's not really a discussion , though . 
  all potential coalition partners made it an non negotiable condition for the next election period . 
  merkel tried to avoid controversy and moved an inch . 
  the spd used that and ran in the door . 
  the bill passed the committee a few hours ago and will be voted on on friday , where it will pass with the votes of the spd and the opposition . 
   well the typical reaction , ignoring all bad facts and preaching your implemented good world philosophy . 
  \u00dc  state sponsored terrorism means being driven around by unions and the socialist parties with tax money to protest at anti-nazi demos . 
  so you did fall for that satire article from the jusos ? 
   germany has fallen . 
  you really like your bubble . 
   funny story this story has been debunked back then by whom ? 
  the detectives at r/the _ donald ? 
   most of the arsons have been made by the guys living there to protest . 
  of course , even those houses which were uninhabited , we 're burned down by the evil refugees , before they even knew they were supposed to go there . 
   and the antifa hunt everybody who is not saying refugees welcome . 
  yes exactly . 
  you 're also thrown in jail if you 're not following shakira law . 
   it is state sponsored terrorism by definition how ? 
  because you read some blog that for a satire article ? 
  * that reminds me , still have to claim my monthly bonus from antifa e.v. 
  *  ask any congressman of afd if they feel safe and if there have been attacks on their property . 
  we do n't even have a congress . 
   but there have been more left wing and muslim attack than right wing or anti-immigrant ones , go figure . 
  yeah ? 
  fun story from germany : http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-11/anti-immigrant-violence-germany, 
  al-kaida or al-nusra are quite picky , the is is not . 
  [ die zeit had an interesting piece ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2017-06/islamischer-staat-islamisten-kriminalitaet-rekruten ) on that , in short , as it is in german : is is purposely recruiting career criminals and promises them a way to redeem them self for their crimes . 
  they can continue to sell drugs or engage in petty crime , ( `` it 's good , because it harms the infidels '' ) and require little knowledge of the koran . 
  some of the article seems to be based on this [ study .

  really depends where you live with the post . 
  high rise bock in a big city ? 
  that 's bound to suck . 
  smaller towns ? 
  you can expect them in the same 20 minute window every day . 
  live in the same street as your postman ? 
  you can set your watch to him . 
  - other than that : you can delay the package , name them a drop off location while the package is already on it 's way . 
  if you have an account you can use the packstation or send it to the post office straight away . 
   central european * versage ** r *** see , you ca n't even get simple zhings like zhe german language right . 
  no wonder we have to babysit you all zhe time . 
  you have been formally put on notice . 
  your german overlords expect better next time . 
   you 'll typically only find contradiction coming from mr. trump . 
  he contradicts absolutely everyone in his administration . 
  including himself ... 
  seems best to just count that as the official response from the us ... , 
  yes , but also no , as the police in dc did not join the the cheer-osmans in beating up the protesters ... 
  do n't forget the man is incredibly ill informed . 
  the g7 meeting in taormina was pretty isolated , so he probably did n't notice the protests there . 
  and hamburg is a little different in that regard . 
  i 'm conflicted . 
  on the one hand that would be hilarious , on the other we 'd miss out on weeks worth of meme material . 
   donald trump has told theresa may in a phone call he does not want to go ahead with a state visit to britain until the british public supports him coming . 
   the us president said he did not want to come if there were large-scale protests and his remarks in effect put the visit on hold for some time . 
   the call was made in recent weeks , according to a downing street adviser who was in the room .
