  the statement surprised may , according to those present . 
  that has to be a new low , even for trump . 
  - i hope nobody tells him what will be happening around the g20 summit in hamburg ... 
  the city might face the biggest number of protesters in it 's history . 
  iirc there are , or at least were plans for a visit in poland ahead of the g20 summit in germany next month . 
  not only the international , but also the german online parts are full of clickbait and sensationalist articles . 
  they still have some good articles in between ... 
  they 've also started `` spiegel daily '' , a subscription online evening newspaper that offers `` just what 's important today '' : that included a review of helene fischer 's new album , an emojy interview and other high quality journalism ... 
  is it ? 
  i just picked the best looking one .

  greetings from bavaria 's scotland . 
   can you be bavarian without voting for the cdu ? 
  but that is essentially the definition being bavarian . 
  not being able to vote for the cdu . 
  - in the last state and federal elections more than half of the bavarian voters picked a party that was not the csu . 
  so yes . 
  please . 
  it 's the csu that 's doing all the whining . 
  #notallbavarians , 
  hope you have a good one . 
  organiser said in a [ statement ] ( https://youtu.be/0suuc67oekm ) they 're hoping the police can sort it out til tomorrow , they 're trying to find a slot for rammstein tomorrow . 
  according to the br they noticed a person in the crew or steward area that could n't be identified properly . 
  ] ( https://br24.de/nachrichten/deutschland%20%26%20welt/festival-rock-am-ring-unterbrochen ) - from all the noise around it seems like one `` possible dangerous person '' ( `` m\u00f6glicher gef\u00e4hrder '' ) might have worked at the festival . 
  but that 's just my speculation at that point , based on a statement of the organiser . 
  mood at the festival seems rather good : https://twitter.com/schappida/status/870731182966804480 https://twitter.com/waesterpicture/status/870720907786035201 - ** edit 1 [ 3.6.2017 00:30 ] : ** [ interior minister of rheinland-pfalz will hold a press conference tomorrow 11.00 am local time . 
  ] ( http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/117715/3651641 ) according to bild two employees of a subcontractor have are being interrogated . 
  apparently police feared they had deposited `` something '' in the concert area . 
  [ tagesspiegel , in german ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/musikfestival-rock-am-ring-nach-terrorwarnung-unterbrochen/19889822.html ) a word on bild : they are notoriously unreliable and have claimed a lot of stuff , just to claim the opposite a few hours later . 
  i 'd suggest to wait for more info on the official press conference in the morning . 
  - ** edit 2 : [ 3.6.2017 10:45 ] ** police states on twitter that the festival will continue . 
  - ^ ^ https://twitter.com/polizei_ko/status/870923134630850560 - - ** edit 3 [ 3.6.2017 11:20 ] after the press conference : **  at a press conference , police chief wolfgang fromm said the koblenz police had received a warning on friday morning that a non-german national with terrorist connections had gained access to security-relevant sites with false identity details . 
  he expressed respect for the visitors who had cleared the area without delay or panic . 
  another police spokesman said that three people had been temporarily detained on suspicion of planning an attack , but were later released . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/rock-am-ring-music-festival-can-go-ahead-after-security-all-clear-german-police/a-39103507 also a lot of praise for the fans from all sides , organizer : `` security plans worked , 86000 fans evacuated the venue within 15 minutes '',

  obviously . 
  this is a very polite `` fuck you '' . 
   so that would mean and independent economic block , with good improved economic ties to china and russia and an independent military ? 
  we already have all of that . 
  although trade relations with russia wo n't really get any better than they currently are ( at least until sanctions are lifted ) . 
  what we 're probably looking at is more integration of the armies of eu countries into what might be come something like a `` eu army ''  without depending on us support . 
  we 're not really depending on us support . 
  us military bases in germany serve mutual interests , but mainly us interests . 
  these bases are also logistics hubs for operations in europe , africa and the middle east . 
  i wish . 
  [ full blown loons ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/what-is-behind-the-right-wing-reichsb%c3%bcrger-movement/a-36094740 ) that are turning more and more violent . 
  [ several are detained on terrorism charges ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/nazi-druid-burghard-b-detained-on-terror-charges/a-37291335 ) , one killed a police officer last year , another `` just '' tried to shoot several . 
   reminds me of some right-wing germans waving aldi bags during a match between germany and turkey in the 90s . 
  this might have been a reference to the `` t\u00fcrkenkoffer '' ( `` the turk 's suitcase '' ) , nowadays any larger plastic bag you use to carry stuff ( not groceries ) around . 
  probably a pretty old cliche from the time the gastabeiter came from turkey . 
  they probably meant : `` go home , here 's your suitcase . '', 
  i was surprised to hear mutti voicing it that clearly . 
  ( not everyone understands the language of diplomacy ... ) but it 's not really that she had a choice : there are fundamental differences on trade , russia , climate and facts in general . 
  we 're at a point were the [ president of the ec is openly mocking trump ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/video/ec-president-juncker-mocks-trump-for-lack-of-climate-deal-understanding-957196355828 ) for his lack of understanding of the paris accord . 
  merkel really tried to get along with him ( there was a discussion if she should even visit him in dc in the first place ) but apparently that 's been useless . 
  during her visit in dc she explained to him how trade deals with eu member states work , but last week trump 's adviser on trade spewed the same bullshit as trump did before ... [ the meeting of the g20 finance ministers ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/opinion-the-g20s-dilemma/a-38016076 ) has also not really achieved anything , thanks to a blockade from the us . 
  if he 's serious about pulling out of the paris accord we have to consider a bringing separate children 's table to the g20 summit in hamburg next month . 
  your second part is n't any better . 
  it 's an army , not some local militia . 
   yeah but what crazy person would put a pregnant woman near a war zone ? 
  til offices in german barracks are literally near war zones . 
  also they are the only party that is not strongly acting against conspiracy theorists , antisemites , reichsb\u00fcrger and nazi and neo-nazis in their ranks ... 
  germany is currently g20 president , with the summit in july coming closer . 
  a few meetings with reasonable leades beforehand wo n't hurt , when you also have to prevent a manchild from making the whole meet up useless ... other than that she has to win a reelection campaign ...

  please do n't ask why we are that experienced in that matter ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpun-ym1szu ( translation in the description ), 
  hard to do that . 
  does n't really work out with the floor plan . 
  the digital tour i mentioned will probably give you a better understanding of it . 
  well , worse things happen to her ... 
  the main problem is that the placement of the other furniture does n't work for merkel . 
  most of the time she 's woking from the conference table next to the door as the desk is too far away from the office of the chief of the chancerlery . 
  some else posted a link to the digital tour which gives a better impression of the room . 
  i thought they had `` just '' 1000 rounds and a few hand grenades . 
  not sure where that comes from ... 
  considering it was completed in 2001 , not really surprising . 
  you got that wrong . 
  while it were harsh words directed at the us and to a lesser extent the uk , it was n't `` fuck you all '' . 
  she specifically said we should remain friends . 
   he offends the leaders of the free world while he seems to lick putin 's and xi 's ass what 's even worse , he does the same with erdogan and duterte . 
  he praised the later for the way he 's handling the drug problem . 
  that must have been another hard blow , throwing human rights and any other principle of law and justice out of the window , just to please a man who is as unimportant to europe as the mayor of chicago . 
  having closer relationships with xi or china in general does n't really bother anyone . 
  well , she did mention them in the same sentence . 
  merkel was speaking about the g7 meeting . 
   `` they walked the 700 yards from the traditional g7 group photo , taken at a greek amphitheatre , to a piazza in the hilltop town , but mr trump stayed behind until he could take a seat in the electric vehicle , '' the times reported . 
  700 yards = 640m there is also [ a picture ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/da2c2qeuaaascfm.jpg:orig ) allegedly showing him on the cart .
