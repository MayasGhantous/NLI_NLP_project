   with this new proposal was n't that indication enough ? 
  anyway , i adapted that sentence . 
  well , considering how often he appears on the political stage , i would n't be too sure eiter :  joachim sauer , merkel 's grim-faced spouse , is so allergic to publicity that he did n't bother to attend her inauguration in 2005 . 
  while she was being sworn in as arguably the world 's most powerful woman , he was hunkered down in his chemistry lab in berlin , though government officials insist he did tune in to watch the ceremony on television . 
   since his wife 's election , sauer -- whose name means `` sour '' or `` grumpy '' in german -- has issued no public statements , granted zero interviews and has only occasionally been seen in public with his wife . 
  so it was big news in germany when he agreed to serve as an official host during the group of eight summit and appear in public to face the cameras , a chore he clearly dislikes . 
  [ from the wapo ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/ar2007060702139.html ), 
  `` mr. merkel '' aka joachim sauer is quantum chemist and professor at the humboldt university of berlin , he is n't really the guy who hangs out with other politicians or journalists . 
  from his wiki page :  even during his wife 's election in the bundestag , her inauguration , and later her taking the oath of office , sauer was not present but reportedly briefly followed the event on tv from his university chemistry lab . 
  edit : the [ wapo in 2007 ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/ar2007060702139.html ) on that topic :  joachim sauer , merkel 's grim-faced spouse , is so allergic to publicity that he did n't bother to attend her inauguration in 2005 .

  if they did n't comply they were fined up to 2.500 $ . 
  with this new proposal , kindergartens ~ ~ are ~ ~ * would be * required to share the names of parents who did n't comply with the existing regulation with the gesundheitsamt ( the local health authority ) . 
  they were n't allowed to do that before , due to privacy concerns . 
  ** td , dr : ** this does not force parents to vaccinate their children , they are just required to speak to a doctor . 
  merkron in action . 
  you have n't read the article , have you ? 
  the only thing this law requires is that you provide a piece of paper that says that you talked with a doctor about vaccinations . 
  given that doctors visits are covered by the insurance and you 're there for checkups anyway this happens without any real nuisance to parents . 
  edit : read a german article about that . 
  the `` talk '' was already required before . 
  literally the only thing that changes is , that the kindergartens are required to share the names of parents who did n't comply with the existing regulation with gesundheitsamt . 
  they were n't allowed to do that before , due to privacy concerns . 
  the only thing this requires is that the parents speak with a doctor about vaccinations . 
  they can still decide not to vaccinate thier kids . 
  big fucking deal and some stasi 2.0 shit apparently ... 
  i love how they ( macron , michel & bettel ) seem to be shit talking about donny during his speech : https://youtu.be/xpjc4gdckxy?t=7m13s, 
   only for the backward ideas of some rural bavarians [ some ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/direktmandate_nach_partei_und_vorsprung_%e2%80%93_bundestagswahl_2009%2c_wahlkreiseinteilung_2013.svg/170px-direktmandate_nach_partei_und_vorsprung_%e2%80%93_bundestagswahl_2009%2c_wahlkreiseinteilung_2013.svg.png ) the csu won all direct seats in bavaria , even the 4 in munich . 
  they currently poll at 45 % + , the spd comes second with less than 20 % ... of course it 's bullshit , just like the herdpr\u00e4mie , just like their flip flopping on the g8 , just like any other `` idea '' they had in recent years . 
  but unemployment and crime rate are low , economy 's good and consumer confidence high , so nobody wants change ... 
  a little bit info on that : this is a csu project , they are the bavarian counterpart to merkel 's cdu . 
  apparently they are allowed one bullshit project every few years , that can even be unconstitutional . 
  ( in that case it 's usually struck down by our highest court ) at the moment it 's unclear if there is any profit to be made , in the end this could even result in an net loss . 
  the idea seems to be widely unpopular , but that does n't really matter , because that 's what was agreed on when the current coalition was formed ... 
  so yes , please take us to court . 
  and the best part of that , it 's all according to protocol . 
  the lady frist , then the hosts ( stoltenberg and the belgian pm ) , and then the manchild . 
  he would be considered one of the hosts , considering this happened in belgium . 
  so it 's probably protocol . 
  does he ignore trump ? 
  he still got his handshake , did n't he ? 
  might be that you have n't noticed , but the other guys he 's greeting before trump are the highest nato official and the belgian pm which are the host of this meeting . 
  sorry mr. trump , but bros before hoes . 
   the car industry is the next one who needs to feel some pressure . 
  i do n't really see this happening , not on their own , and not forced by the government . 
  seehofer ( mp of bavaria and head of the csu which hold the ministry of transport ) just advocated for subsidies for people buying euro 6 diesels , although it 's proven that many of them do n't meet the standards ... 
  there is also the story with the german post trying to convince german automakers to produce a electric transporter for them . 
  in the long run they wanted to replace their fleet of 70.000 vehicles . 
  but apparently none of them could be really bothered and so they bought an existing startup and produced their own cars : [ their first models are already on the streets . 
  ] ( http://www.streetscooter.eu/media/zoo/images/streetscooter_work_2016_gelb_08c351385817eb4dd8c89d37fc00d6ec.jpg ) [ and yes , the model is called `` work '' ] ( http://www.streetscooter.eu/media/zoo/images/streetscooter_work_2016_weiss_f05475145ea3301360c0e9a99beafe3c.png ), 
  yeah , that seems to be a tradition . 
  but the three guys had those 1000 rounds and apparently also a few hand grenades . 
  probably need to clarify that one . 
   i doubt this bunch intends to make a clean getaway . 
  their death list was pretty long . 
  i doubt they could have pulled that off within days ... 
  they wanted to kill our former head of state , minister of justice , several other high to mid ranking politicians on state and federal level . 
  * first : you can legally buy guns in every country in europe , if you can comply with local restrictions . 
  military grade ( mainly meaning full auto ) is difficult to impossible . 
  and it is advanced stupidity to use your own registered firearm to commit crimes , is n't it ? 
  * second : it is n't proven that they did steal them . 
  it has been said that they tried to buy rifles on the back market , but either changed their mind or did n't go through with it yet . 
  investigations are still ongoing . 
  * third : you know what these guys are accused of and how they were caught ? 
  it 's not that terrorists are perfectly reasonable people . . 
  and as i 've got a youtube video to back you up , that has to be the truth . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lfkn7qgp2c that 's how it works , right ? 
  why ? 
  it 's not that you can buy a military grade rifle at every corner in germany . 
  acquiring ammunition was n't a problem either , about thousand rounds for the p8 and the g36 were found at the apartment of an accomplice . 
  the ammunition was apparently stolen during shooting practices . 
  stealing the weapons mentioned in the article was apparently easier than it should have been : they were left overnight in the vehicle , which is against code . 
  someone familiar with the vehicle knew that and apparently also wich hatch is the easiest to break open ... also , one of the arrested officers might have stolen a p8 as early as 2014 . 
  edit : clarified the statement about the ammunition . 
  die zeit has released the english transcript . 
  he said `` nutcase '' ... http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2017-05/nigel-farage-brexit-ukip-russia-contacts/komplettansicht, 
   wa\u0142\u0119sa was proven to be on the secret service pay roll . 
  was it proven ? 
  the article puts it as `` the ipn which is close to the government claims ... '' and wa\u0142\u0119sa disagrees when asked about it . 
  but i have not bothered to look into that ... 
  fun fact : in an [ interview with die zeit ] ( http://www.zeit.de/2017/14/lech-walesa-solidarnosc-polen-demokratie/komplettansicht ) lech wa\u0142\u0119sa ( solidarno\u015b\u0107 and former president of poland ) called hin `` mentally ill '' . 
  but to be fair , wa\u0142\u0119sa himself did n't seem too sane either ... 
  there went through almost the same thing when i was in elementary school . 
  but we had to wear helmets ... 
  well , he looks reasonably skilled with the broom . 
  yep , climate science seems to be the better word in that context . 
  fixed the parent comment . 
  have you read past the frist sentence ? 
  they basicially deny man made climate change and that too much co2 has an harmful effect on the climate . 
  harald lesch has a more in depth analysis of the segment in german : https://youtu.be/legmii6ruuq edit : autocorrect got me . 
  the deny ** man made ** climate change . 
  not really . 
  her family lives in swizerland , she 's paying taxes there . 
  quite strange , at least for a nationalistic party ... and that startup thing is dubios as well : she does n't want to comment on the startups she worked in , the ones that were verified ( 2 , at that time part of rocket internet ) do n't speak highly of her ... 
  but that 's of course no problem with the real afd crowd . 
  why listen to journalists when you can just plug your ears and scream `` lala lala lala lala '', 
   if they really are why does the only action from the government , after seeing that their refuge registration and observation failed again , is to rename some old buildings .
