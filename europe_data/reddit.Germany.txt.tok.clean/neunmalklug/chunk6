  3 arrests , several other suspended bundeswehr soldiers , ongoing police investigations , several bundeswehr investigations launched , including how nobody : * bothered to report his [ racist , ultra nationalist conspiracy theory manifesto disguised as a master thesis ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bundeswehr-master-in-theorien-der-verschwoerung-1.3486969 ) * noticed that they were stealing ammunition * complained that he was absent frequently to play a refugee * at the mad ( the intelligence agency responsible for protecting the army from extremists ) noticed anything . 
  luckily the ministry of defence is capable of doing multiple things at once ... and has nothing to do with the federal office for migration and refugees which is investigating the incident from their side . 
  they for example have suspended the ones processing his application and are reviewing their cases . 
  all this takes time and only generates boring headlines ... 
  well , if you just causally leave out the whole part with the terror plot ... it does sound laughable . 
  [ see my other reply ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bb6ki/german_army_needs_to_remove_ww2era_names_defence/dhlgwji/ ), 
   the reason behind that thing is that an officer of the army was collecting ( and smuggling across the border ) forbidden war requisitions you 're kidding right ? 
   `` the accused is strongly suspected of planning a severe act of violence against the state out of a right-wing extremist conviction , '' the prosecutor 's office said in a statement . 
  [ ... ]  `` the suspects have classified their possible targets in various categories -- there were categories from a to d , '' a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutors ' office in karlsruhe said . 
  the former german president , joachim gauck , and the current justice minister , heiko maas , were determined to be `` a category '' targets . 
  [ ... ]  security sources told spiegel that online chats between franco a. , mathias f. , and maximilian t. clearly showed their attitudes and readiness for violence . 
  one investigator told the news magazine that each member confirmed `` they were ready to kill for their cause . '', 
  authorities are still unsure exactly what the three men were planning to do . 
  they did , however , uncover around 1,000 rounds of live ammunition from the bundeswehr stashed at the home of mathias f. also , the trio allegedly bought a gun in austria . 
  in mid-january , franco a , hid the weapon in a bathroom for the disabled in the vienna airport , where it was later discovered by the austrian police . 
  [ dw , 9th of may ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/report-top-german-officials-on-terror-suspects-hit-list/a-38766679 ) these guys are fucking terrorists . 
  not just poor collectors interested into the wrong part of our history . 
  but he is free to hold that opinion . 
  he 's free to hold any opinion . 
  voicing it in public got him in trouble . 
  a quote from his wiki page :  in november 2007 , mahler was facing new volksverhetzung charges stemming from an interview for vanity fair with michel friedman ( cdu ) , a ** former vice president of the central council of jews in germany ** . 
  friedman , who intended to interview mahler about his role in the raf , brought charges against mahler alleging that he was greeted with a hitler salute and a shout of `` heil hitler , herr friedman ! '' . 
  during the interview , mahler told friedman that `` the systematic extermination of jews in auschwitz is a lie '' and that adolf hitler was `` the savior of the german people [ but ] not only of the german people . '', 
  well ... he 's also been a founding member of the raf , went to prison for terrorism , bank robbery and his role in the liberation of andreas bader . 
  so it 's not that he 's just some poor old man ... 
  right , just looked it up . 
  we received 0 points in 2015 . 
  we did that last year ( i guess ? ) . 
  but i ca n't even remember who took part ... few people actually take this whole thing seriously . 
  suck it spain !, 
  edit : this has nothing to to with portugal . 
  it 's just great that we are n't last . 
  that should be 3 points better than last year . 
  that is considered a success . 
  you mean as they tried to send a christian right wing conspiracy nut who thinks germany is a occupied country ? 
  then realised that this was n't a great idea , made up a completion and send someone else , who then came in last ? 
  hardly . 
  why not ? 
  the afd just needs to jump those 45 points . 
  they just need to get 900 % more voters than they have currently . 
  this is totally possible . 
  seriously now . 
  with all that shitty regulations those morons are imposing : why should i ever bother visiting the us ? 
  for good reason ... 
  i kind of regret switching my vpn on for this bull crap . 
  iirc his ancestor ran away from military service and tried to come back afterwards , but was denied . 
  seems like running away from the draft is a family tradition after all . 
   such stupid unfounded drivel . 
   i wonder how that talking point ever came exist . 
  you guys should be thankful for the language barrier that excudes you guys from most of our conspiracy shit : * germany is a gmbh ( legal entity/company ) and not a real state * all media is briefed personally by merkel/the us/illuminati * we 're secretly ruled by the us * merkel wants to switch out the `` ordinary germans '' with migrants , because these are easier to rule they call themself [ reichsb\u00fcrger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsb%c3%bcrgerbewegung ) . 
  our `` federal office for the protection of the constitution '' estimates that 10 000 are part of the scene , 500-600 of those right wing extremists . 
  according to a report the building is rented out for 38.000 euro per month . 
  germany is complying with a un-security council agreement from november 2016 that prohibit these rent contracts with north korea . 
  [ tagesspiegel \\ [ german \\ ] ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/berlin-mitte-bundesregierung-will-cityhostel-in-nordkoreas-botschaft-schliessen/19779534.html?utm_referrer= ) has a few more details . 
   seems farage does n't read much . 
  that is almost too kind ... 
  the quote in german is :  ich denke , sie sind ein spinner !, 
  you can look at the different translations of `` spinner '' [ here ] ( http://www.dict.cc/?s=spinner ) . 
  could be that he used loon , nut , oddball or crackpot . 
  but that does hardly change anything of the context . 
  die zeit/zeit online is a highly respected newspaper/news site . 
  they would n't risk thier reputation for someone like nigel farage . 
  the translations here in the comments are fairly accurate ( at that point two + one from me . ), 
  you 're welcome to believe what you want , but then i 've got a quote for you :  you live in a fairytale world . 
  other `` interesting '' quotes , slightly adapted from google translate , ** my accentuations in bold ** :  zeit online : i would just like to understand your role . 
   farage : we have no connections with russia . 
   zeit online : so you never met the deputy russian ambassador in london ? 
   farage : no . 
   zeit online : not in 2013 , before the brexit campaign was designed ? 
   farage : ah , wait a minute . 
  he came to my office in the european parliament . 
  maybe i met him in london . 
  so what ? 
   zeit online : why did you meet with him ? 
   farage : i think you are a loon !, 
  you are a real loon !, 
  the brexit was the best thing that happened - for russia , for america and for germany . 
  it 's all about this . 
  seems someone did n't like that question . 
  also quite ironic that he left the uk out of that enumeration . 
   * farage 's speaker interrupts the interview . 
  he asks that farage should talk more about the trade links between germany and the united kingdom . 
  farage nods . 
  *  zeit online : the economy of great britain and the economy of the rest of the eu are weakened by the brexit . 
   farage : they 're talking trash . 
  the eu is a failed project . 
  the idea that it is good for the economy is just as much rubbish . 
   zeit online : ** since when do you actually believe this untruth ** ? 
   farage : since 1990 . 
  even then i realized that the whole system is nonsense . 
  it will never work . 
  it took us a while , but now we have made the exit . 
  we british are the first , but other countries will also leave the eu . 
  sounds like farage started believing his own bullshit in 1990 , but could n't think of any arguments in the last 18 years . 
  a bit later in the inerview :  zeit online : you are a citizen of the united kingdom ? 
   farage : yes . 
   zeit online : if a hard brexit were to come , you might not be able to fly to brussels or hamburg ** without a visa . 
  **  farage : already before 1914 there were no passports , it worked well . 
  so what are you talking about ? 
  obviously you do not know about the story .
