  the system is screwed so no wonder there are people with criticism . 
  as the internet shows you , people enjoy hating . 
  the reasons will be found after the fact . 
  disagreed . 
  i have friends from some critical hot areas in the world ( mexico etc. ), 
  and what they all usually agree about when they share their experiences is just how much of an illusion the daily perceived stability is . 
  one day everything is normal and people chill at starbucks talking about football . 
  two weeks later there are burning cars and violent riots all over the country . 
  seriously . 
  50 years of peace and stability do * not * mean that things ca n't completely tip over within a matter of weeks . 
  scary to say the least . 
  5 years tops the eu will break apart . 
  i am a major proponent of the eu ( loving schengen & common currency and general freedom ) but the financial crisis and the refugee crisis have revealed major cracks in the system . 
  the entire governing body ( especially the eu commission ) is seen as corrupt and dysfunctional by a majority in europe . 
  most eu laws they enact are either to the advantage of few nations which then piss off the rest , or some nasty compromise that everyone hates . 
  no nations can trust each other in europe , that has been evident since 2008 . 
  one nation exploits the other in some way or form . 
  hungary / poland etc. 
  suck up the money pumped in from germany / uk / france , and germany / france exploit the weaker euro nations to the point where they are depicted as vampires and nazis in political cartoons . 
  the ideologically motivated eastern extension of the eu as well as the preposterous inclusion of some southern states into the euro currency will possibly be what breaks the unions neck . 
  if uk votes to leave in 2016 / 17 this will be it - point of no return reached . 
  so are they supposed to freeze and starve while being prohibited from working ? 
  what bothers me is that we let in thousands and thousands of people from conflict zones and everybody expects that the refugees leave their conflicts at home . 
  i find the help and empathy amazing , really . 
  but the naivety and ** forced ** ignorance of the consequences we will face is astounding on at least the same level . 
  the world is far more complex than `` help everyone because empathy and we want to be good people '' . 
  it just does n't work like that . 
  i ca n't believe the media is generating this `` helper hysteria '' in our country right now ( for example by showing nothing but crying refugee children on frontpages ) which will completely vanish within 12 months maximum . 
  and then we are left to deal with the consequences of the trendy and social media-fashionable hyper-empathy void of any realistic view of the situation . 
  i really do n't think that all these university-educated people , who rarely ever get into touch with the world of blue collar workers and who are the loudest on social media , understand at all what they are doing when rational behavior and realism now means to be a `` concerned citizen '' ( = euphemism for racist , foreign hating native germans since pegida ) . 
  edit : i just wanted to clear up that i am really glad that we are helping people from war torn countries but i am shocked with what sort of propaganda all of this is treated in the media . 
  i understand and support heavy criticism of violent or inhumane acts of aggression against foreign people and i am glad that we are welcoming . 
  but it is insane that words of caution and appeals for some stoic rational view of the situation ensure that you are buried in criticism and pushed into the right wing corner . 
  this is how you generate a new nationalist movement from a formerly reasonable middle class . 
  lol guns . 
   johnlocke95 ah , edgy teenager i see . 
  agreed, 
  you do n't understand at all what is happening there . 
  his point is that he has fantasies of violence against all refugees . 
  this is extremely wrong and false . 
  the majority of news outlets was giving merkel and cdu / csu terrible shit for their incompetence with regards to the situation . 
  these things do n't work . 
  if you actually go and interact with the refugees you will quickly learn that 99 % of them had extremely compelling reasons to flee . 
  of course right extremist redditors ( immigrants from stormfront really ) know so much better from their basement . 
  the refugees do n't give a fuck about some change in refugee policy or some stupid wall . 
  agreed . 
  but here is the thing . 
  nothing will stop millions of refugees coming to europe . 
  nothing . 
  no fences , no laws . 
  you ca n't seriously suggest using armed forces against civilians , this will never ever be seen as something justifiable ( thankfully ) . 
  politicians are all scared to say it how it is : we are at the * beginning * of mass migration from shitty third world countries which ** in part ** exist due to us / eu foreign involvements . 
  there are tens of millions of people coming within the next 2 decades . 
  europe has no choice but to prepare and deal with it . 
  there just is n't any other option . 
  this is n't fear mongering either but a plain look at reality . 
  germany is selling a shitload of weapons to the region . 
  t do n't act like you 're not sharing responsibility . 
  / unpopular opinion added to collect upvotes for being edgy, 
  if russia fixes isis in syria the entire world owes them thanks for that at least . 
  that 's so wrong it 's not even funny anymore . 
  woops , thanks !, 
  only the atlantic in between ...  we should all just hope to have as many countries politically close or united as possible . 
  no ones culture or heritage needs to be taken away but cooperation benefits us all and protects from major conflicts . 
  no sharia law found anywhere , can you please fuck off you fucking bigot ? 
  that 's not germany in a nutshell ... thats a pretty shitty statement tbh . 
  turkey currently has 1.5 million syrian refugees . 
  your argument is stupid at best . 
  based on people not actually knowing or caring about shit , like usual , it is whatever opinion the media incites . 
  eu army wo n't happen . 
  no way , not in a million years . 
  good luck without germany , sweden , france and the uk . 
  sometimes i feel a good portion of britain would rather be american . 
  and how do you think they cross the borders to get to the asylum centers ? 
  without passports ? 
  cause it sure as hell ai n't legal . 
  this has absolutely nothing to do if the refugees seeking refuge is a good thing or not . 
  in order to do that they have to enter the country . 
  and they ca n't possibly do so legally . 
  this is why it 's called illegal immigration . 
  what is blatantly false now ? 
  how smart would it be to give up all the stability , safety , and prosperity that we have in order to jerk ourselves of off che guevara and some other `` revolutionary '' fucktards ? 
  it would be zero smart . 
  if anyone in western europe think they have it bad they should try out living in any country more east than poland or more south than spain . 
  might be 10000, 
  since i have found myself asking this question about 100 times the past month i tend to confirm that yes , this is a message board of majorly teenagers and failed adults . 
  and afterwards we bash germany . 
  they ** need ** to break the law to ever be considered for asylum . 
  the real problem here is that there is no legal safe way for people to apply for asylum . 
  they ** have ** to break the law , it 's literally no choice . 
  except that this is a huge problem and retarded leftist behavior at best . 
  dangerous is more like it . 
  this is how you push people to the far right and the polarization that has occurred in our country is shameful . 
  this is a novel situation for the entire country and the influx of refugees ** is ** massive . 
  it is normal and natural to be scared . 
  especially when politicians have zero answers as to how we deal with the problem . 
  as a german i know which people you are talking about , `` pegida '' etc. , and i fully agree on calling their bullshit out . 
  they called themselves `` concerned '' while really just being bigots . 
  but you can not lump them into one pot with people who are really concerned about how we will deal with the situation . 
  not being concerned is actually the far more insane approach .
