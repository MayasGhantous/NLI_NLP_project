firstly , they get an additional phone call and ample time to evacuate -- which is just what the occupants of that house did -- and secondly , you and amnesty are basing that on what , the unfortunate possibility that there * might * still be victims ? 
  there * always * might still be victims with any practical warning method used , iow then you 're making up impossible standards of warfare to condemn israel wholly regardless of what it does , when in fact this method shows it hazard the likelihood that one of the very causes for the strike , which is terrorists hiding among civilians , will likewise escape . 
   you just had to choose that one , right ? 
  i think is less about critising rt and more about promoting your own worldview . 
  no , i picked it because failing to check one 's sources makes it a parade example of shit journalism , but thanks for the malicious insinuation . 
  also , plain atrocious journalism . 
  eg , during israel 's last gaza intrusion , somebody uploaded edited footage of iaf roof knocking \\* . 
  the video had all that time in between the knock and actual bombing cut -- and explicitly said so in its description , in arabic . 
  which the rt author either did n't read or deliberately ignored , in effect claiming it was evidence of how israel willfully jeopardizes civilian lives . 
  it took rt over two days to fix the errors , during which the article was widely passed around . 
  aside from that , it took them even longer to delete rabidly antisemitic comments that were as high as second place . 
  \\* : in which they phone call and drop a mostly harmless ( unless it lands right atop somebody ) missile on a target building some 15-30 minutes before it 's actually reduced to rubble , so that civilians in it have enough time to escape . 
  * e : * [ article ] ( http://rt.com/news/172316-israel-knock-roof-video/ ) in question , fixed version obviously, 
  they should just rebrand themselves to pravda today and adopt its old slogan , `` all in print is news that fits . '', 
  and that was before july 's tightening of our asylum laws , which declared serbia ( along with macedonia and bosnia-herzegovina ) a `` safe country of origin '' , thus allowing rapid denial & deportation . 
  in general , the asylum numbers for germany are wholly unimpressive , especially once you subtract the basically one-time special admission of a limited number of syrian refugees included in these 2013 figures and adjust for country population . 
  actually cookedbird has the right one . 
  from fp :  merkel presented to xi a 1735 map of china made by prolific french cartographer jean-baptiste bourguignon d'anville and printed by a german publishing house . 
  also , this article seems to refer to the wrong map reported in chinese media :  a map published in many chinese-language media reports about merkel 's gift-giving shows the chinese empire at its territorial zenith , including tibet , xinjiang , mongolia , and large swaths of siberia . 
  [ this larger map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:china_and_japan,_john_nicaragua_dower_ ( 1844 \\ ) . jpg ) was the handiwork of british mapmaker john dower , published in 1844 by henry teesdale & co. in london , and was certainly not the gift from merkel to xi . 
  nixon 's reestablishment of relations with china was facilitated in no small parts because mao saw the us as the lesser evil . 
  for a time even the prospect of nuclear war between china and the soviet union loomed . 
  german taz had [ an article ] ( http://www.taz.de/militaerpolitik-in-russland/!135411/ ) on this a few days ago . 
  supposedly the poor performance ( in terms of efficiency ) during the last war with georgia made the kremlin recognize that it was high time for profound military reforms , not least since the country 's demographic development means that the old concept of mass mobilization was outdated anyway . 
  so they fired tens of thousands of officers and hundreds of `` not combat-ready '' troop units , in compliance with putin 's order to reduce the army to a million soldiers and aggressively expand elite units . 
  he 's well aware that while russia 's nukes still shield it from any aggression , this makes any prolonged involvement in something beyond a localized conflict near impossible . 
   year of the linux desktop for whatever reason , every time i hear those words the [ back to the future ii theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxuwof20tki ) starts playing in the back of my head . 
   very lucky that nato had very specific targets which included large refineries and chemical plants like those in pan\u010devo ( near the danube ) , leading to enormous environmental damage and with that a rise in cancer and infant mortality rates . 
  then there 's the use of depleted uranium , too . 
  dubious if that too counts as `` very lucky '' . 
  iow , it was n't as clean as it would seem . 
  never heard of anything like that . 
  google does n't turn up anything either . 
  can we get a source ? 
  * e : * [ atomic demolition munitions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atomic_demolition_munitions ) . 
  nothing anything about there being actual slots nor about this project leaving the planning stage , though . 
  but the german wiki does cite two sources for 1985 : one stating that western forces had 93 ready for all of europe , the other that 300 were ready for use in west germany alone . 
  with the eu being one of the palestinian authority 's main bankrollers ( the other big one being the us ) , how do you respond when the pa minister of prisoners ' affairs issa karake goes [ on official pa television and says ] ( http://blog.camera.org/archives/2014/02/wheres_the_coverage_pa_to_incr_1.html ) :  the europeans want their money that comes to us to remain clean -- not to go to families of those they claim to be terrorists . 
  [ they ] need to renounce this occupation mentality . 
  these [ prisoners ] are heroes , fedayyeen ( self-sacrificing fighters ) , and fighters who fought so that we could live in dignity ... 
  these heroes , whom you are applauding , must live in dignity , so that we will continue to hold our heads high . 
  we appreciate the people of the revolution and are proud of them . 
  well , i actually agree with you on that . 
  what irks me though is when people simply ignore costs ( and their distribution ) of actually occurred accidents when arguing for the economic benefits of one sort of energy or another . 
  ( the [ banqiao & shimantan dam disaster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banqiao_dam ) is probably a better example than bhopal here . ), 
  the vulnerabilities and shortcomings of the plant were well known for at least a decade . 
  japanese politicians/regulators and their close pals in the industry denied them , often responding with that the odds for such quake to were `` negligibly small '' . 
  meanwhile us regulators have repeatedly weakened their security standards to keep their aging plants operating within the measured values . 
  it 's nice and well to hear about all those great new security features in yet-to-be-built plants when that 's the climate prevailing among those responsible for the nuclear safety of actually existing ones . 
  ` edit : ` grammar, 
   can an accident go beyond that ? 
  compared to the immediate damage and decades of costs yet to come for fukushima daiichi , two billion $ are a joke . 
  the plant is still not under full control , its reactor 3 [ has n't even been explored yet ] ( http://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2ftaz.de%2fbesuch-in-fukushima%2f!134567%2f ) . 
  the comment by imswedishgiveupvotes is simply crap , and this exaggerated circlejerk about germans being oh-so-scared `` irrational fearmongers '' regarding nuclear energy is every bit as inane as the similarly exaggerated circlejerk against nuclear energy within germany . 
  i 've written this a while ago ... [ overall germany does not buy energy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/apdmtok.png ) . 
  whatever energy is imported from nuclear plants in france is more than compensated by exports to other neighbors . 
  some of the decline in ne production has been made good ( [ official numbers for production ] ( http://www.ag-energiebilanzen.de/index.php?article_id=29&amp;filename=20131220_brd_stromerzeugung1990-2013.pdf ) ) by coal -- which the large political parties love as it means lots of local jobs -- most of it by expanding regeneratives . 
  if people outside of germany were n't by and large entirely ignorant about the political-industrial corruption , incompetence and plain fuck ups surrounding ne here -- gorleben and collapsing [ asse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ibmta.jpg ) , to name two prime examples -- they might actually come to understand that the popular distrust goes far beyond the simplistic technological aspect . 
   anschluss is just the german word for annexation . 
  only a very particular kind of annexation , namely those done by nazi germany ( or in a `` comparable fashion '' , as press eg . 
  currently likes to refer to russia as preparing the `` anschluss der krim '' ) . 
  in its historical use , anschluss translates more appropriately to `` connection '' ( the progress ) . 
  annexation itself simply translates to `` annexion '' or `` annektierung '' . 
   yet the series of events were extensively studied in [ tagliavini 's independent fact-finding mission ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93georgia_war#independent_international_fact-finding_mission ) and do n't at all read as if they are `` exactly the same situation '' . 
  the cultural & political history of that conflict is considerably different as well . 
  the 2008 war started when after months of mutual clashes * georgia * launched an entirely disproportionate artillery attack on south ossetia . 
  saakashvili was fully aware that as so 's protector , the kremlin would soon respond just as it did . 
  he purposefully wagered on escalation , just as the kremlin did in turn . 
  40 + tabs will probably be close to a once in a lifetime event for me .

  people just love their clich\u00e9s . 
  lots of german wiki pages on cs topics are pretty great . 
   what question i will answer it for you ? 
  take a look at recent raided threads on eg . 
  worldnews and europe . 
  you 'll see * exactly * same primitive derailment by posing an unrelated question followed diversion \u00e1 la `` answer it '' over and over again , commonly accompanied by provocation , tone policing , etc.

  6 years `` cillas shrine time '', 
  so pogroms , repeated and open declarations of hostility against jews by the government itself and the clergy as well as `` general policies '' aimed directly against jews are `` nothing serious '' . 
  well , that 's one way to whitewash anti-semitism and quite accurately fits the definition of denial . 
  good luck with that . 
  emanuel melzer 's no way out lists half a dozen official and semi-official acts after pilsudski up to the german invasion . 
  there 's no proper copy of it online , so [ this will have to do ] ( http://cdn7.foreignpolicyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/121126-soddu-anti-semitism-interwar-europe.pdf ) ( page 6 ) . 
  grabski 's reforms disproportionately hit polish jews ; the entire fourth aliyah was dubbed `` grasski aliyah '' . 
  his national democrats were openly chauvinistic and particularly anti-semitic .
