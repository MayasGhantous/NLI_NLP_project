  during the 1920s , this formula was implemented by the government 's finance minister , wladyslaw grabski , who nationalised those branches of industry and commerce in which jews were most heavily represented , then dismissed jewish employees in favor of poles . 
  as a result , fully a third of the nation 's jewish merchants were driven to bankruptcy , any emigration soon became their only hope . 
   [ estimates in the polish press in 1935 and 1936 ] ( https://pdf.k0nsl.org/n/nazi%20germany%20and%20the%20jews%20-%20saul%20friedlander.pdf ) that hundreds of jews diedin the pogroms that erupted at the time in no fewer than 150 polish citieswere probably too low .17 a hidden quota in the universities brought thepercentage of jewish students down from 20.4 percent in 1928 -- 29 to 9.9 percent in 1937 -- 38.18 what happened in the universities took place moreopenly in the economic field , with a boycott of jewish commerce leadingto a sharp decrease in the number of jewish businesses during the yearsimmediately preceding the war .19 the pauperization of wide sectors of thejewish population had begun long before the war , but in the post-pilsudskiera , the economic boycott was supported by the government itself . 
  to besure , anti-jewish violence was officially condemned , but , as prime ministerfelician slawoj-skladkowski put it in 1936 , `` at the same time , it is under-standable that the country should possess the instinct compelling it to de-fend its culture , and it is natural that polish society should seek economicself-sufficiency . '' the prime minister explained what he meant by self-suf-ficiency : `` economic struggle [ against the jews ] by all means -- but withoutforce . '' 20 by 1937 -- 38 polish professional associations were accepting gentilemembers only . 
   [ in a pastoral letter ] ( http://librarun.org/book/61660/48 ) issued on february 29 , 1936 , cardinal august hlond , the highest authority in the catholic church in poland , tried to restrain the growing wave of anti- jewish violence : `` it is a fact , '' the cardinal stated , `` that jews are waging war against the catholic church , that they are steeped in free - thinking and constitute the vanguard of atheism , the bolshevik movement and revolutionary activity . 
  it is a fact that the jews have a corrupting influence on morals , and that their publishing houses are spreading pornography . 
  it is true that the jews are perpetrat-ing fraud , practicing usury , and dealing in prostitution . 
  ... but let us be fair . 
  not all jews are this way . 
  ... one may love one 's nation more , but one may not hate anyone . 
  not even jews . 
  ... one should stay away from the harmful moral influence of jews , keep away from their anti- christian culture , and especially boycott the jewish press and demoralizing jewish publications . 
  but it is forbidden to assault , beat up , maim , or slander jews . '', 
  so , say , post-pi\u0142sudski 's semifascist colonel regime with its anti-minority policies -- which practically destroyed the economic survivability of polish jews -- the lethal pogroms in over 150 polish cities in 1935 and 1936 , the especially toxic anti-semitism of polish catholicism in a population that still largely listened to it ( eg . 
  the 1920 statement by its bishops , or just the 1936 pastoral letter of hlond ) -- that 's just noise , no ? 
  edit : post-pi\u0142sudski 's , not pi\u0142sudski 's, 
  why promote modern poland when you can also rub the past into people 's faces for the most inane reasons , indeed . 
  * eurovision winner sued for plagiarism *, 
   a single point i wonder if we 'd have gotten that far had ann sophie ( i had never even heard of her ) just stood there in silence for those 3m . 
  should have given those to lithuania . 
  5.8 % russians yet not a * single * point, 
  with a population of almost 6 % russians , rather ... unreal . 
   `` goat-fucker '' those parts are also what 'll likely get b\u00f6hmermann ultimately convicted . 
  the german constitutional court has a record of deeming heavy insults covered by freedom of speech ( unlike lower courts ) when they relate to a public figure 's actual deeds , but sexual ones have just about always been ruled illegal . 
  stuff like , and this dates back to [ at least 2009 ] ( http://www.religioustolerance.org/rt_turkey.htm ) :  in contrast to the children adhering to the two non-muslim religious communities acknowledged in the education system - christians and jews - alevis , baha'is , children of other faiths and atheists are forced to attend de facto sunni religious education classes in public and private schools . 
   toxic asset ah , with [ pr like this ] ( https://twitter.com/andrewyweller/status/715662344660115456/video/1 ) he 'll be back as washington 's darling in no time . 
  love how they 're raging about the burqa . 
  never mind that the video also satirizes clothing and she 's even removing it about three minutes in , ai n't nobody got time to watch so far when filled with burqa rage, 
  so i hope , too . 
  we 'll see , given statements in [ reports like these ] ( http://www.maz-online.de/brandenburg/saufen-und-kiffen-gegen-die-langeweile ) :  my first interest was my old syrian friend , who has been living here the longest and really does n't want to leave . 
  why ? 
  he rules here . 
  on our first meeting he told me that is fighters live here as sleeper agents . 
  he confirms that many remain in tempelhof . 
  rumor is of an arbanian mafia group , he tells . 
  it 's said to sell right of residence papers , faked ones of course . 
  not much , but we 've already gone on a tangent with the nsu and raf . 
   so at least for germany you can say there 's no connection . 
  that does ignore the importance of germany as a terror hub , though . 
  like the [ hamburg cell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburg_cell ) , or abdeslam apparently [ collecting three syrians ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/bruessel-terror-razzia-113.html ) from a migrant housing . 
  guess what , i have no heightened interest either in arguing with somebody who conceals that the polish buildup for coal would happen anyway and instead insinuates that it 's due to german renewables . 
  whose mention of `` specialist programs '' of course ignores that social welfare has a ) just about always included aid for utilities and b ) that the increase is just as well due to rising oil & gas prices exacerbated by stagnating wages . 
  who despite repeated request does n't provide any sources . 
   but then , green movement rarely cares about poor , beyond the lip service . 
  never mind that germany has been ruled by conservative-led coalitions since 2005 , and that those have continued to socialize the costs while exempting industries . 
  but of course it 's the `` green movement '' conspiracy that 's behind their energy policy . 
   germany is so deep in red on energy spending today let 's return to the topic , the cost of electricity export & import . 
  another [ press release ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/presseservice/presse/pressemitteilungen/2013/04/pd13_125_51pdf.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) by the federal office of statistics itself :  with the commodity electricity germany earned 2012 a surplus of 1.4 billion $ . 
  the value of energy exports totaled 3.7 billion $ , whereas the the import totaled 2.3 billion $ . 
  again [ that federal institute ] ( https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/aktuelles/meldungen-2016/deutsche-stromexporte-erloesten-im-saldo-rekordwert-von-ueber-2-milliarden-euro ) with figures for 2015 :  germany has attained a trade [ balance ] surplus of 2.07 billion $ on electricity exports . 
  the value lies markedly above the old record of 1.94 billion $ from 2013 . 
  a more detailed analysis of the data shows that the electricity exported abroad on average earns the same market prices as the electricity imported to germany . 
  `` the assertion that germany is gifting abroad surplus electricity from renewable energies is not corroborated by the numbers '' , concluded prof. bruno burger of fraunhofer ise , which evaluated the data of the federal office of statistics . 
  -  overall , i have no more interest in arguing with someone who openly lies about what others have claimed to suit peddling their agenda . 
  cool , at least i 'm not the one whose garbage insinuations started this thread , and am actually providing sources . 
   no one is saying that there are no rapes in sweden or that immigration is all fairytales and happiness . 
  about that , has there ever been a proper international overview that `` normalized '' the different ways of counting that are employed in national crime/rape statistics ? 
  iirc sweden is a bit particular in counting almost all incidents separately , as opposed to other countries where eg . 
  spousal rape is counted as one incident no matter how often it occurred over a year . 
  in german , `` energie '' commonly refers to electricity ; in that it 's the largest exporter , and that 's what both this thread is about and the links clearly show . 
  you 're right of course if you consider `` energy '' to refer to the physical quantity . 
  i guess that 's the usual english meaning , my bad . 
  ah , now i see . 
  sorry , i had you confused with another who who blamed the polish coal plans on german renewables & nuclear phase-out , and somehow thought you argued for something similar . 
  sure , but it 's about ( phasing out the ) `` burning coal in households , offices and restaurants '' . 
  meanwhile we were talking about power plants , and poland is building as well as plans to build plenty of new coal ones . 
  i 'm sure you 're aware what an informative statement that is . 
  also that guardian article has nothing to do with polish coal energy production , has it . 
  when you socialize the costs . 
  take the [ uk 's planned nuclear plant ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-34306997 ) : the uk payed \u20a4 44/mwhr in 2015 , but its gov ' t had to guarantee the plant 's operators \u20a4 89.5 for 35 years ( strangely , [ 92.5 ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-energy-nuclear-britain-hinkley-idukkcn0rk15920150920 ) according to reuters ) . 
  so now it 's no longer `` cheap ( est ) '' but `` cost does n't matter '' . 
  never mind how much of chinese air pollution is caused by industry and a disregard for environmental standards , rather than the burning of coal itself ( which is still of the prime sources , to be sure ) . 
  anyway , you might want to [ have a word with poland ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/why-poland-still-clings-to-coal-energy-union-security-eu-commission/ ) . 
   and paid far more for imports of far less in terms of watt hours . 
  what ? 
  please rephrase that , i 'm not 100 % sure what you mean . 
  anyway , that $ 2b is * net gain * . 
   did you have a point ? 
  yes . 
  we export more energy to poland than we import , * contrary to your claim * . 
  we earn much more money with exports than we pay for im - and exports , * contrary to your claim * . 
  that , and you have yet to provide actual figures & sources . 
  * edit : * which would show you that poland 's energy strategy foots on the buildup of coal independent of the german situation anyway : 1 . 
  it faces a massive shortage of local production -- some 8 gigawatts by 2020 -- meaning those plants are a ) required anyway and b ) wo n't be exporting then . 
  its grid is shit and would need to be expensively overhauled , making it a disincentive to renewables -- unlike germany , which is on track to solve its north-south grid weakness . 
  poland 's existing coal power plants also largely in need to be replaced anyway , and it has no serious plans for nuclear . 
  perhaps most importantly , poland prices an increased energy resource independence from arch foe russia , and perceives coal as its only option . 
  * edit2 : * grammar fixes for the nth time, 
  those are federal statistics , wiseguy . 
  in 2015 germany earned [ 2 billion $ ] ( https://www.br.de/nachrichten/stromexport-strom-deutschland-100.html ) from exports . 
  ** edit : ** that one 's a `` green pundit '' figure ( state institute for solar energy ) , though * i 'm sure * you can provide a source for the total balance that supports your claim . 
  that , and eg . 
  the planed plants for the uk were given vastly inflated price guarantees by the government . 
  germany exports [ vastly more energy into poland ] ( https://www.energy-charts.de/exchange_de.htm ) . 
  in fact , germany is europe 's [ largest energy exporter ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/153533/umfrage/stromimportsaldo-von-deutschland-seit-1990/ ) , and has only been expanding that position over the years : 50.1 twh in 2015 . 
  cheap because nobody has yet accurately assessed the total cleanup costs . 
  here in germany the industry 's long time pr answer was a `` cleanup fond '' they paid into , now guess what , it 's not enough and they 're fighting the state to not have to pay the reminder . 
  ( socializing of that cost is almost inevitable , those companies ' finances are too bad anyway . ), 
  or about the other end , construction , eg . 
  areva 's much famed epr .
