  apparently there are not many people living in the murderous areas . 
   was just thinking why you got stuck with the brits . 
  where are they on the map ? 
  according to [ wiki ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/faroe_islands_in_its_region.svg/330px-faroe_islands_in_its_region.svg.png ) they should be roughly where the ` g ' from ` languages ' is . 
  as others have pointed out there is no iron cross anymore . 
  besides , that would be a military award . 
  what 's currently being discussed is giving him the [ ` bundesverdienstkreuz ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_merit_of_the_federal_republic_of_germany ) order or merit of the federal republic of germany ) which is a civilian award and the only federal decoration issued by germany . 
  iirc it 's quite seldom issued posthumously , but in his case it 's not unlikely to happen . 
  there 's also a [ petition for that ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/anschlag-in-berlin-petition-fordert-bundesverdienstkreuz-fuer-lkw-fahrer-a-1127462.html ) ( it 's in the article , i ca n't link directly ) . 
   english way of using quotations when reporting on something or someone being called something . 
  weird manner indeed . 
  yep , it 's hard to place that sometimes . 
  though using quotes for a quote does make sense . 
   i 've missed this . 
  i 've only read that the original driver was killed near milan and gotten his lorry stolen . 
  what did he do ? 
  the guy killed near milan was the terrorist . 
  the lorry driver , lukasz urban , was killed ( or at least fatality wounded ) inside his hijacked lorry by the terrorist . 
  probably when he tried to stop the attacker from driving into the market . 
  yep . 
  if these were n't islamists i 'd be extremely suspicious as well . 
  but given that these are wannabe martyrs it seems likely that they actually want their names to be public or at least do n't mind it . 
  and as others probably already mentioned , carrying a passport with you makes sense if you want to get through controls before you commit the crime . 
   how do we know he was the right guy ? 
  as far as i know he was just a suspect . 
  they found both his passport and his fingerprints in the weaponized truck . 
  so if it is n't the right guy , it 's a * very * elaborate framing . 
   i do n't think you 've seen greece 's bar tab yet . 
  it 's not * that * bad . 
  the absolute public debt per capita in greece is about as high as in germany . 
  the problem is n't so much the money greece owes but the lack of a competitive economy . 
  hence increased investments from the eu could help . 
  i mean , if a business could borrow at roughly 0 % it would invest like crazy and thinks like building roads and educations have rois of [ 200 % or so ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/infrastructure-economic-multiplier-2012-11 ) . 
   there are no nato bases in estonia , latvia , lithuania . 
  that 's only technically correct , is n't it ? 
  i know that there 's some form of treaty / understanding that disallows * permanent * stationing of nato troops in the baltics ( all of formerly eastern block europe ? 
  ) , but i 'm pretty sure there are always a few hundreds ( soon to be thousands ) nato troops there . 
  just not stationed but on rotation . 
  iirc it has something to do with you guys [ not having an airforce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_air_policing ) and russia being close . 
   financially too ? 
  asking for ... reasons . 
  why not ? 
  the eu already distributes money on quite a scale and and it would n't be too hard to include things like unemployment insurance ( which would work great because you could pay it according to cost of living which would reduce the amount of redistribution needed ) . 
   political preferences has very little to do with intelligence . 
  i do n't think that 's accurate . 
  intelligence data is always a bit hard to get in that context [ but this for example says that in the uk green voters have 10 iq points more than bnp voters ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/nov/03/greenpolitics-liberaldemocrats ) . 
  when it comes to education the difference becomes humongous . 
  e.g this is the vote in austria a few weeks ago : [ link in german ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-12/wahlergebnis-oesterreich-waehler-bundespraesidentenwahl ) . 
  the overall result was 53 % for van der bellen ( greens ) and 47 % for hofer ( fp\u00d6 , right wing populist ) , but 83 % of voters with a university degree voted for van der bellen and only 17 % voted for hofer . 
  granted education correlates with a lot of things ( young age , income , being female ) , but it 's quite safe to say that educated people lean toward what americans would call liberal . 
   if this is true this man should receive the highest honors possible . 
  i also think the german state should take care of the financial future of the family . 
  i hope they do that . 
  people living in germany generally get a small pension from the state when they 're the victim of a violent crime ( the idea is that the state is supposed to protect people and thus liable when it fails at that ) . 
  for foreigners not living in germany it 's a bit more complicated and apparently most only get a one time payment at best . 
  the full benefits are only granted to citizens of countries which have a similar program and grant the benefits to germans , too . 
  source in german : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/opferentsch%c3%a4digungsgesetz, 
  it 's also unclear whether or not the attacker intended to survive . 
  maybe his goal was to die in a firefight with the police and then he got cold feet about that part . 
  it 's the complicated thing with these religious fanatics , they 're not rational . 
   some people were concerned about germany 's open door policy with islamic migrant that 's kind of the problem . 
  this ` open door policy ' never really existed . 
  to this day not a single migrant from the middle east has been granted a refugee visa or something of that sort . 
  the problem is just that there was n't ( and still is n't ) a eu wide mechanism to deal with mass migration . 
  hence the eu 's border countries were overrun more or less immediately and germany and some other countries ended up being the only ones with the capacities to take people in . 
  the dublin protocol simply does n't function when you ca n't sent people back to greece because greece is n't capable of guaranteeing a fair asylum-process . 
  the sentiment was never ` open door ' but ` fuck , people are here , must treat them according to human rights standards ' edit : i give you that the appearance of such an open door policy was ( and is ) indeed widespread , but for the most part it 's just a rumour that turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  the actual difference in asylum processes between germany and countries like france or the uk is rather small . 
   for terrestrial services , the last mile to the customer is the most expensive . 
  that 's why high-speed services in remote regions can only be achieved by space-based services . 
  well , at least in europe there 's hardly any area left that 's remote enough to not be covered by directional radio , so there is indeed an alternative . 
  in most cases the radio option should be cheaper , too . 
  there already is . 
  it 's called [ iridium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iridium_satellite_constellation ) . 
  these satelites are mostly for phones , but they plan launching a new version that will offer better data packets . 
  iirc quite expensive though . 
   so you are trying to justify rape ?? 
  if so and if this is true where the fuck do yo get that from ? 
  i 'm just saying that there are limits to what we can do to criminals . 
  we can lock them up and deport them to most countries , but we ca n't kill or torture them . 
  and sending people to certain countries is just that . 
   what do you mean grabbing someones private parts isnt a sexual assault ? 
  he/she is paraphrasing the german laws as they were a year ago . 
  grabbing people was only illegal under sexual assault laws if there was some kind of coercion/threats . 
  there simply was no law defining non-violent sexual assault/groping . 
  hence judges usually handed down sentences for ` t\u00e4tliche beleidigung ' ( action based insult ) . 
  which is the same law that would be used if someone spits at you ( or slaps you very lightly , under some conditions that 's not covered by assault laws ) . 
  by now there 's an ~ ~ extra paragraph in the sexual assault article ~ ~ edit : there 's a new article for groping ( which does carry a lesser sentence than the kinds of sexual assault that were already classified ) . 
   there is absolutely no excuse for that . 
  they should be deported , but that 's not always possible without violating their human rights . 
  we do n't have the death penalty and delivering human to their sure death is quite similar to executing them . 
  so deportation is a big no-no if there 's an immanent threat to their life . 
  that said , it might be possible to relax the rules a bit for violent offenders . 
  so it will never ever be constitutional to send an enemy of kim jong un back to north korea , but sending someone without personal enemies to the calmer regions of afghanistan or maybe even syria might be possible . 
   this was bound to happen . 
  this leftist narrative that the syriza party cultivated before seizing power was unreasonably soft on crime . 
  weak on criminals , weak on illegal immigration and an establishment of absence of law and order . 
  let 's not forget that they also portraited the far-left terrorist organization 17n as `` humanitarian '' . 
  greece is bankrupt and prisons are * very * expensive . 
  it 's hard to blame a country for trying to save money when even financing healthcare becomes problematic .
