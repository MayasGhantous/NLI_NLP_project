to be frank , the german va for bruce willis is an outlier though . 
  it 's pretty much the only one i prefer to the original . 
  i really wish we had less dubbing here in germany . 
  the voice actors are quite good and have their own character but it gets tiresome and jarring hearing the same va for completely different actors with completely different roles and a completely different personality . 
  the one for bruce willis is excellent though . 
  after reading up a bit , in the year this map was made that part of russia even got absolute autonomy from the rest and declared [ it 's own soviet republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_german_autonomous_soviet_socialist_republic ) 6 years later . 
  or swedish . 
  [ this ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17q3wh/sylvester_stallone_says_that_despite_his_rambo/c87vdmg?context=2 ) looks pretty clear cut to me and ruining / r/politics even further does n't help your credence to be modding / r/europe . 
  and what could possibly help with getting water from water-rich regions to the regions suffering of draught ? 
  infrastructure !, 
  and what is detrimental to profits of private companies ? 
  investing in infrastructure !, 
  which is also why people who live on the countryside are having the crappiest connections to the internet . 
  the uk ran out last year because their infrastructure is destroyed thanks to what margaret thatcher did . 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes libtards . 
  here 's a source http://translate.google.de/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vdi-nachrichten.com%2fartikel%2fduerre-im-land-des-nieselregens%2f57633%2f1 and here some more http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17690389 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103809/uk-drought-2012-water-companies-say-mustnt-spend-four-minutes-shower.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/drought/9205639/britain-faces-worst-drought-since-1976.html, 
  in fact , i did live in a fucking multicultural area all my life and i never really felt unsafe . 
  i even smoked some stuff with some of those immigrants in the second and third generation and they can be rather nice . 
  the problem , i found , was the white `` g4ngztahz '' that were primarily hanging out with them . 
  maybe , just maybe because they are also profiting from being in the eu . 
  many people visit there since greece profits a lot from tourism . 
  also , germany and france deliver weapons for their very long ongoing war with turkey . 
  if we would n't , turkey could just grap cyprus and be on their merry way and greece could just look dumb . 
  give it up , that guy seems to be a frequent poster to / r/israel . 
  you ca n't expect an unbiased opinion about muslims from a guy that lives in a country that stole the land of muslims unrighteously . 
  yeah , me too . 
  i mistook a 5 $ for a 20 $ bill more than once when looking in my wallet to see how much money i had left . 
  thank god most stores accept ec . 
  i just handed one in yesterday . 
  my power bill returns were mailed by cheque . 
  but that was the only one i ever used . 
  the same happens in rural parts of european countries , too . 
  and in rural parts of the us no less . 
  in rural parts of bavaria , christianity plays a huge part in the daily life . 
  i ca n't see why we should have such double standards just because turkey has another religion . 
  because that 's the wrong religion if you listen to the white rights groups that seem to have invaded this thread . 
  not really . 
  maybe the turks you see here in europe are more influenced by religion but from what i 've heard everyone who visited turkey saying , it is a lot more progressive . 
  they also have secularity written in their constitution . 
  and then your office package splits again and you have to retrain everyone again . 
  i am from the northwest of germany myself . 
  i just do n't like how the bavarian citizens screw the votes in the conservative 's favor at every election . 
  and if they want to split from the rest of us , i 'll gladly let them have their own little conservative state . 
  i would welcome bavaria splitting from the rest . 
  where 's the problem then ? 
  sounds like they 're proper germans . 
  only idiots would ever join the military . 
  because when the people from turkey first entered the country they were told it was just temporary so neither side worked on active integration . 
  that led to some turkish communities in germany that did n't have to work on integration anymore even after they were told they could stay . 
  but nowadays , most 2nd generation immigrants are pretty properly integrated . 
  i live in a poorer region myself and there 's basically no difference between turks and germans here , other than the turks not eating pork . 
  besides , there 's lots of great d\u00f6ner shops in my town so i ca n't really complain . 
  d\u00f6ner kebap is delicious and did a lot for german culture . 
  you do know that there 's also a lot of refugees from eritrea ? 
  the only country that scores worse than north korea on the democracy index ? 
  why the hell would an organization with enough power to give their members fake documents so they can fly to their destination send people on a life threatening trail that takes months instead ? 
  it does n't make sense . 
  we just passed a law that doubled the amount of time refugees have to spend at reception centers before being allowed to move on , while not having enough of those already . 
  this will get pretty ugly in a few months because the csu had their hands in that law . 
  did you not hear about what happened in turkey just * yesterday * ? 
  turkey is not a safe place for anything but turks at the moment . 
  the left is not marxist-leninist you idiot . 
  if anything it 's trotskyist . 
  there is a marxist-leninist party in germany but it never achieved anything . 
  it 's called mlpd . 
  trotskyism is very very different from both marxist-leninism and the hyper authoritary stalinist line that killed millions of people . 
  imagine you havent seen your family for months while struggling to move to a country and then be told they cant follow you because you missed a deadline . 
  you would have to be a psychopath to not go crazy . 
  i do n't see tensions flaring up in my hometown of bremen . 
  and we have the most refugees/capita . 
  we barely notice they 're there . 
  just because islam is n't a race does n't mean you can be a bigoted assclown . 
  edit : hmm i wonder who is brigading this, 
  a glorious socialist revolution would help , 
  blaming refugees . 
  they are doing their best for the people engaged in the union via their collective bargaining power and unions only exist because of big socialist movements in the late 19th and early 20st centuries . 
  if they did n't use their political power back then we 'd still work 80 hour weeks and send our kids into mineshafts . 
  well it does n't really make much sense to be in a union if you 're engaged in a party that 's directly antagonistic to the working class . 
  yeah democracy would be great at the workplace . 
  which is what corbyn explicitly supports . 
  but ww2 was won by russia and not by the us ? 
  all you did was fight over some mounds of dirt in the pacific and horribly murder whole cities . 
  the us literally caused the whole agreement to be a farce so they would sign the deal at all . 
  [ they attacked it at every opportunity already ] ( https://theintercept.com/2017/06/01/will-trumps-slow-mo-walkaway-world-in-flames-behind-him-finally-provoke-consequences-for-planetary-arson/ ) and now they are n't even taking a part in it . 
  also , china 's emissions per capita are only half as high as the us and they 're already taking steps in reducing their economy 's reliance on coal and investing tons of money into renewable energy so their model will be sustainable . 
  china is already doing all they reasonably can to reduce their country 's footprint on the environment . 
  the worst polluters being syria and nicaragua ? 
  those two countries surely are leading the world 's emissions per capita . 
  maybe socialist economies tend to fail because as soon as socialists get elected in pretty much any country the us does everything in their power to make them fail . 
  they lead coups against them , finance militant groups to fund an uprising , embargo them and deliver an endless stream of propaganda to everyone worldwide . 
  meanwhile it 's own citizens are doomed to suffer and get no adequate medical care even though americans spend way more per capita on healthcare than almost everyone else in the world . 
  and the invisible hand of the free market also means that people in flint only had contaminated water for the last 3 years . 
  even if you are a radical cdu voter , do n't you see that welfare is a big subsidy for grocery stores and landlords ? 
  from your perspective it should be the greatest thing ever since it powers the economy from all the way down , to all the way up and then down again . 
  but under the hood it 's still just safari which has a worse version of webkit than chrome has so your websites are rendering worse . 
  damn . 
  did n't have one since the last time i played flash games . 
  which was years ago . 
  yes ios does n't permit using any other browser than safari . 
  every browser you see on the appstore is just another skin for safari .
