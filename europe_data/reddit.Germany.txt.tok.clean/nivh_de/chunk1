that 's a hard question for a german , there is so much fear in us that our ( car ) economy could fail ... you have no idea : / but what we can say , that this will be expensiv , more than expensiv . 
  several german media and so called experts saying that worldwide roundabout 18.000.000 cars are inolved . 
  only the repair costs are located at 1.000 $ ( 1.141,63 usd ) per car . 
  18.000.000 x 1.000 = 18.000.000.000 $ ( 20.549.300.000 usd ) this is without any indemnities , only to bring everything in order . 
  and we all know what will happen in the us with that :( but also in europe will the indemnities cost more than volkswagen actually have . 
  ( does this sentence makes sense ? 
  volkswagen ag have over 200.000 employees only in germany , over 600.000 worldwide . 
  and we should n't forget all these companys in germany which are only exist because volkswagen is a costumer of them ... germans expect everytime the worst case , and no one knows what will happen . 
  it sounds much , but if you 're going into the details it is n't really good . 
  german exports are based on two kind of products . 
  cars with 17 % and machines with 15 % , in result 32 % or 1/3 . 
  we do n't sell many machines , just the big and complex ones , and they 're just expensiv af . 
  and what happened to the german cars we will see , since the volkswagen incident we 're not sure how it will be in the next years with our exports . 
  and many germans think that this is n't good that our economy is based on our exports . 
  because as you say , if the world have problems , we will have them too plus some other . 
  ah okay , then i 'm sorry for saying that you did n't have done a research . 
  false numbers everywhere - . -, 
   gdp that germany gain more than 50 % of it 's gdp through exports is not true . 
  it 's 45,6 % . 
  please check your arguments before you spread false knowledge .

  the problem here is the definition of `` terrorism '' . 
  and food , this could take a while . 
  why do you post the google image search for `` europe '' ? 
  i love the one with the piano . 
  well , i thought the same way at first , but the title of the picture says  the most well known figure per country it does n't say the person is born there and hitler was a well known figure in germany and a nobody on austria . 
  i thought they would sign ceta , why have n't i heard anything about this cet thing in media ? 
  oh i 'm sorry , could everyone else do me the favor and do n't click the link i posted previously ? 
  thanks . 
  [ i think you know the answer already ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lcpqaxq.jpg ) edith : sorry for bad photoshop work, 
  do you have a source for it ? 
  i would appreciate an english article if you find one . 
  i have n't even looked at the image ... 
  i was kinda shocked cause netherlands are just a bit more than hour away and i was there so many times and i just thought that i missed something important, 
  anti russia , that 's enough to know . 
  edith : otherwise i ca n't explain to myself how you would choose this title after you read the article or the first sentences . 
  the us have prisons in other countries ? 
  how comes ? 
  huh ? 
  when i have a look in the internet at the netherland time , it 's the same as in germany right now , 21.05 o'clock . 
  do you know this conspiracy theory that he richard byrd found a secret nazi base and that they saw flying ufos ? 
  he made an official expedition , [ operation highjump ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_e._byrd ) ( to find in `` later antarctic expeditions '' ) . 
  no , i do n't believe this . 
  is n't the word magma implying that it 's molten ? 
  and german media like : nothing happened , just move on ... 
  so this guy on the top of the mountain stand there for several hours without moving ? 
  of course ... 
  five words or less ... 
  placede is with you, 
  you came to late , that 's all . 
  and now you 're trying to steal , thats what spanians can do ... steal, 
  i got the joke . . 
  no context given . 
  no switzerland , just no . 
  and still , good job austria . 
   the empire ? 
  really !? 
  well , yes really . 
  the roman empire did n't start in 962 - in 962 was otto i. crowned . 
  he was the first king after the karolingers - the first of the liudolfingers . 
  he was the king of the `` ostfrankenreich '' . 
  he and his following kings brought during the next 100 years some more territories under their control . 
  during that time , the `` reichsidee '' was reborn . 
  around 1100 ad , `` regnum teutonicum '' ( kingdom of germans ) was the first time named in historical sources . 
  the first time that this terrritory got an official name was in 1157 ad `` sacrum imperium '' ( the empire ) and later in 1254 ad `` sacrum romanum imperium '' ( the roman empire ) . 
  the addition `` nationis germanic\u00e6 '' ( of the german nations ) was used from the late 15th century on . 
  so you prefer not to talk about ? 
  great idea , great way to live . 
  you just should n't drive into a country or make trade deals with them , when you and the females at all are forced to do this !, 
  i bet no . 
  just started to learn ... 
  oh no not more refugees ... please go ahead to the middle east . 
  there recently opened a lot of space . 
  roads are okay , but at the houses have to be things done . 
  not much , just here and there a bit . 
  you can watch at these pictures , shot from the airplane . 
  thanks to the airforce for that btw ... 
  but why ? 
  we create something , sell it to dumb american companies , which pay far too much money for it , more money as we really need , then chill our life . 
  that 's not dumb , that 's the idea .

  well , i think that it 's pretty normal for the ecb to create a plan if the eu breaks apart . 
  i mean , they should have a plan for this scenario in the pocket when it 's happening . 
  or should they panic when it 's happening because they have no plan ? 
  according to the russians in germany : her friend thought he 's / she 's a german . 
  so , after i missed the last weeks , i want to get in here . 
  at this time we can say , the german identity slowly developed .

  debts . 
  we have something similar in germany too . 
  you do n't have to intervene , but you 're obligated to call the police . 
   in a statement , the crown prosecution service said police had decided to take no further action in relation to five other youths who were at the scene .
