wait , is n't that god save the queen at 0:16 ? 
   they even said to avoid trainstations and public places . 
  goodness , that 's actually worse than the american media that i 'm seeing . 
  namibia too . 
  white vinegar or go home !, 
  ( malt is okay . ), 
  you win . 
  i mean , name * something * that everyone likes . 
  ireland 's . 
  but more so ireland 's rugby anthem . 
  sorry to highjack the thread , but i might as well ask . 
  my father was an american diplomat in germany multiple times and in a few locations , throughout the past 25 years or so , and ireland as well for a bit . 
  any interest there ? 
  ( of course , some ideas for questions would be neat , to get his attention and interest . ), 
  `` american beer is the tits ! '', 
  putin . 
  icelandic vegetarians, 
  `` moldova does n't * reeeeeaallly * exist . '', 
  session in the park !!, 
  yeah , because who wants to go to malta anyway ... people do n't actually live there !, 
  man 's probably got a job !, 
  he 's got shit to do !, 
  hardly ... 
  in fact , this eurovision entry might actually be the first i 've heard in a good while which i can more than simply `` stand . '', 
  i do n't understand why all these maps have ireland as this backward country . 
  ( and there 's been quite a couple . ), 
  i went to high school there and in each and every social concern ireland was ahead in so many different ways , most importantly discussion and change . 
  homosexuals will most definitely find a home in ireland ( dublin at least though i 'm sure like with many places in the world any large city will be good ) , and definitely will not need to live in the fear of persecution . 
  same goes for religion . 
  i did not meet a religious person under the age of thirty while living there . 
  not . 
  one . 
  and with abortion laws ? 
  that 's changing too . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is , i think every one of these maps has bias against ireland because of it 's image as this staunchly catholic state . 
  `` this is england '' , `` misfits '' , `` skins . '', 
  but judging from what i 've experienced and observed ... no . 
  my mum jokes about it once in a while , though she does talk about how pretty it was to be . 
  what are the differing attitudes towards neighbouring countries ? 
  austin *, 
  really ? 
  * [ looks at video . 
  sees flags . 
  just over 400 euros . 
  that 's still quite a difference . 
  holy crap . 
  the season ticket statistic . 
  that 's insane . 
  true true true . 
  very true . 
  at this point , both of us would largely be just speculating . 
  except that hungary is an eu member ( and gets benefits from brussels ) and yet orban every couple of months makes positive comments about russia 's foreign policy vis-a-vis anti-eu , and has also made large financial deals with moscow . 
  he does seem to align budapest more with russia . 
  i made that point because kazakhstan is very much aligned with moscow , and his comments/opinions are becoming less and less subtle . 
  obama is n't aligning washington with copenhagen . 
  he really is just affirming allied status . 
  there is a fine difference here . 
  i love them all . 
  but because i visited it recently , and i want to mention something no one else has , bosnia spec . 
  sarajevo & mostar is/are fascinating . 
  so i 'm told . 
  i wish for the best . 
  i fell in love with budapest . 
  the food , people , culture , history ... that subtle overlooked `` doing our own thing '' atmosphere of it all , i love that kind of stuff . 
  perfectly worded !, 
  using a combination of first past the post voting system for most of the seats , as well as the d'hondt allocation distribution method for the remaining seats ( which results in a larger more prominent party to have the ability to easily continue winning seats ) [ for an explanation of the d'hondt system , look here . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27187434 ) it 's hard to tl ; dr , buuuut , think the splitting of vote counts once in half and after that whoever is # 1 gets the vote . 
  if you win a seat , you too must divide your votes by half for the next seat to be won . 
  if you have a lot of votes going into this process , you 're going to win a lot . 
  i wrote a paper on this a while ago , and the source that really spurred on the interest in this issue was [ this one . 
  ] ( http://www.meltanyossag.hu/content/files/hungarian%20electoral%20system%20and%20procedure.pdf ) i will try and track down the rest of the sources if i have the time . 
  in short , viktor orban and his fidesz party have created a wonderfully tactical electoral system that gives the illusion of smaller parties being able to snatch up remaining 93 seats ( keep in mind , 106/199 of the seats in congress are first past the post majority , and these 93 are proportional/d ` hondt system ) but in reality , it 's really shockingly easy for a party in power to stay in power because of the flaws within the d'hondt system . 
  furthermore , orban extended easier voter eligibility/ability to hungarians who live permanently abroad as minorities ( primarily in romania ) where they are a ) often pro-orban from the get-go , and b ) likely to be pro-orban now because of the `` recognition . '', 
  his party had a slight over 50 % majority in 2010 , and this illusion made other members of government think this new system was a good idea . 
  lastly , instead of two rounds , the elections are now only one round . 
  this removes the ability for a snap-coalition to be made to challenge the victor ( heh ) of the first round . 
  ( not that there ever was going to be one ) with a coalition with a supporting minority christian-right party , orban 's fidesz party now ( after the election of april 2014 ) has a 2/3 majority * solely from his party and coalition partner alone . 
  * bills , measures , actions , motions and so on that they want/like are passed so breathtakingly quickly . 
  of course , any countering movement by other parties is shut down very quickly . 
  ^ ( also , want to keep your job in politics ? 
  vote with the party in power . 
  maybe you can get a job with them later after your party runs out of money . ), 
  also , orban knows how to win over countryside voters . 
  i think he went on a stadium building spree leading up to the 2014 election , despite a ) the hungarian football league not doing well in performance or attendance , b ) most of the countryside hungarians cant afford tickets anyway , thanks to a decimated economy spurred on by serious brain drain of young educated hungarians thanks to bad management of funding , investment , etc by the hungarian government , particularly on education . 
  ( this last point i am making entirely based off of a conversation i had with my friend from budapest a few weeks ago . 
  no source on this one , but i would n't be surprised . 
  there have been lots of protests regarding education funding cuts in the past few years ) it should be noted that orban frequently alludes that his government aligns more with moscow , rather than brussels . 
  ( which is funny considering russian-hungarian history ) i think this week he was quoted as saying `` i feel more at home in kazakhstan than in hungary '' or something along those lines . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://hungarianspectrum.org/2015/04/03/viktor-orban-feels-more-at-home-in-astana-than-in-brussels/ ) so really , it 's nothing truly ( to a point ) `` criminal '' but rather hilariously ( to a point ) cunning . 
  hungary is n't under a dictatorship . 
  but it is a very , `` flawed democracy . '', 
  ( thank you / u/kabav ) one last point . 
  i 'm making the above post from memory . 
  i might have a few things missing or flat-out wrong ( i hope not ) and later tonight , if i remember to and have the time , i 'll try and track down my paper and look for some of my sources . 
  but honestly , a half hours google search will bring enough up . 
  not quite , but with the recent constitution/election reforms passed by orban , you 're not far off . 
  lol, 
  you know that whole `` back in the good old days '' bullshit ? 
  that 's what faz is lampooning here , not `` germanness '' in general . 
  also , lol - most of the people going `` that looks fine with me '' do n't have german flair .
