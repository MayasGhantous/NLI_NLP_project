i expected that answer . 
  people start to stutter when this question is ask . 
  but yet , they demand * integration * . 
  name 5things to clarify `` integrate '', 
  do other people eat the fence when they want to get to the other side ? 
  close . 
  in this `` gesellschaft '' means `` company '' . 
  that 3f are kind of new ( well not anymore ) . 
  we had a orthografie reform to make german easier ;d . . no shit . 
  schifffahrt had just 2f before . 
  but that was wrong because its `` schiff '' ( ship ) and `` fahrt '' ( driving ) . . so schiffahrt missed a f to make total sense . 
  so now it has 3f . 
  . . logic , isn \u00b4 t it ; dd, 
  lol :d, 
  1 start a fire 2watch them burn 3then call for water to extinguish the glimming debris . 
  always the same with consumers . 
  stuck on the media level forever . 
  who \u00b4 ll whips and pushs you to the next topic ? 
  what will be the topic ? 
  ... stay tuned . 
  share , like and leave some angry simple thoughts in our comment section . 
  . . aaaaaannnd don \u00b4 t forget to click the ads, 
  but * this route has tolls * . . indeed, 
  i \u00b4 d like to poke you with your own weapons / u/dclauzel you should delist this post for being `` non-relevant '' - `` local '' news ;p, 
  exactly this  we 're not stupid , uk coal would be ridiculously expensive due to the salaries we pay here and this  thatcher being the ultimate enemy of socialism who shut down coal mines when the unions went on strike . 
  it would be so expensive that you have to subsidize it from minute one . 
  and i \u00b4 d expect this idea came from the strong union wing . 
  nothing against unions but there are some overaged , slowly decaying , battlefields on which you just can \u00b4 t win anymore . 
  and yes , i don \u00b4 t know much about uk politics . 
  but fuck thatcher for such a move to undermine the workers rights . 
  our women expect the impossible from us men . 
  you shouldn \u00b4 t mind her old age , but beware when you forget her birthday , 
  sunt = sont = sind ... all the same :d * roman * ce after all, 
  lol . 
  you don \u00b4 t even have to speak or know french to understand that sentence . 
  that \u00b4 s one gentleman like democratical statement . 
  however , he will burn as a socialist . 
  the media will excavate everything they can , just like the edgy part of the opposition , to make it happen . 
  i don \u00b4 t know him . 
  but in the upper list i \u00b4 ve already found two points . 
   believes in renationalising the railways clear `` yes please '' from my side . 
  my stance is that every infrustructure which is essential for our state of civilisation should be state owed . 
  i \u00b4 d even expand that to water and electricity too . 
  if the private sector can make bln \u00b4 s with it , a state could run it a more or less non-profit orientated and higher the quality of service , or lower prices . 
   re-opening coal mines no , no , no . 
  ... . whyyyy even ?? 
  dying outskirts are everywhere . 
  germany looks the same in some places . 
  abandoned , rotten little towns . 
  shout `` whataboutism '' but this happens all over the world . 
  centralisation & rural depopulation is still a thing . 
  post that in polandball as a request . 
  its a funny skit edit : k , since op and iam not that welcome or to dumb to get into that secret cult . 
  @one of the chosen ones . 
  just post his idea already - . - ... move reddit . . stillstand is boring :d, 
  [ homework for upvoters ] ( http://www.mappery.com/map-of/europe-proposed-natural-gas-pipelines-map ), 
  slovakia can say `` thank you '' to ukraine . 
  eversince it is known as a unreliable partner . 
  if they are pissed about anything or can \u00b4 t pay the bills they blackmail russia & passively western consumer countries by simply sutting of the supply . 
  they are a chokepoint of the pipeline network . 
  so yea , slovakia gets punished for no reason because their neighbours give a shit about contracts, 
  that make me laugh out loud . 
  it just misses the rest of the picture , juncker humping her hip : ddd let me try something . 
  ... @ / u/awildsketchappeared, 
  ^ implying he knows nothing about the nature of beer ;d, 
  everyone is equal before the law isn \u00b4 t ment to be a joke . 
  if you take someones product and sell ads all around this * copyrighted work * what would be wrong with paying a fee or something . 
  every single person has to go through it too . 
  just because its google doesn \u00b4 t mean anything . 
  there market value is someone elses work . 
  ;d suprise your wife with buttsex , she \u00b4 ll love it [ so no , not really . 
  soooo , we don \u00b4 t say anything about `` masturbating together '' ? 
  nordic fetish ? 
  `` refer to an anti-social youth subculture '' ... ehmm , redditors ?!, 
  my bad . 
  however , the answer is still out of the questions context, 
  - . - funny that the first , and most picked , answer has actually nothing to do with the question . 
  :d ... fun fact . 
  brits theoretically enlarge their penis size by hiding in statistics ; dd, 
  yea , and when a mod would erase them / r/europe is lighting the torches and the outcry is big - . -, 
  thanks for the link . 
  i prefer original speeches over sliced quotes in the tabloid any day edit : i know i can swap to english translations , but damn , italian sounds so awesome :d, 
  i bet all the other mods are just too arrogant to admit how lazy they are and let the new one do the dirty work ... but serious over what period of time is that mod-history ? 
  total of 10k seems okay fo a sub with 456k and an average 500-1200 user . 
  the question is . 
  how do they do the work ? 
  is the majority of mod activity done after reports or due to free will ? 
  heroin was marketed as a cough mixture and cocaine against toothache, 
  it is `` ein blindes huhn '' und kein hund ... :d, 
  i totally agree . 
  while uschi wants to shine and be some kind of useful . 
  its also about time for some income on the manufactures sides  . . fuckin lobbies the most fun part is . 
  we have the g36 since 1997 or so . 
  and 20years later someone acknowledges `` oh , this ins \u00b4 t accurate '' - . - the media coverage was pretty stupid . 
  the only thing what angered was , that heckler & koch were allowed to put the seal of approval on the weapons by there own . 
  the official statement was something like `` years of trust . . blablabla , we trusted them ... blablabl '' . 
  maybe h & k did lower the quality . 
  comfort cars and flights are the modern thrown . 
  tl : dr `` people who read nothing are smarter than people who solely read newspapers '' edit : iam sorry to bother / r/europe with a * dumb * quote from a founding father of the u.s. - . - ... silly me . 
  i should have known better - . - ... next time i quote a less profound statesmen .
