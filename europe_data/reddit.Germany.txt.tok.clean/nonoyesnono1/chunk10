  and ? 
  should we germans up the fence with that tabloid quality ?!, 
  . . lol wan na know what comes with political education ? 
  you just don \u00b4 t give a fuck about some simple minded individuals/citizens . 
  it is simply unrealistisc and a false conclusion to draw russia or russians as the devil with such pictures . 
  you use the 70th anniversary of the victory for your own political agenda . 
  ten of millions russians died to defeat the nazis , and i say an honest thank you russia for that . 
  it is a disgrace that you misuse this for your agenda . 
  beside of nowadays politics you should jump over your own shadow and say thanks for that victory too . 
  without the russians ukraine wouldn \u00b4 t exist today too . 
  get this in your brain . 
  but i guess you are to full of hatred to acknowledge history . 
  edit : i almost forgot when you ask `` germans '' in general , you just want to hear about partial conformity, 
  somehow i feel proud to be german but i \u00b4 ll be honest . 
  in terms of economy , we all live in a capitalistic world . 
  it is hard - near impossible - to maintain every country at the same level . 
  competition sux when it comes down to have enough tax revenue or houshold incomes . 
  germany is just so prosper because of the european comparisons and we spread it all over just like american branches . 
  give me a country and i would emphase the same settings for all . 
  equality rules . 
  same loans and costs at first , no moaning anymore !, 
  thats the equation everyone needs within europe and beyond . 
   but yea , i wouldn \u00b4 t rule any other country differently . 
  the best advice for every country men is , buy within a local range of reach of responsibility . 
  keep your own - social - system alive . 
  that sounds nationalistic , but its true . 
  kilted tea time ?!, 
  i didn \u00b4 t expected such short & smart pragmatism . 
  cheers , 
  i ask . 
  so it \u00b4 s up to you to imagine it  statesman or cheeky bastard . 
  its up to us , all of \u00b4 ya and me !, 
  yes and no you have to admit that it weren \u00b4 t some politicians signing a treaty who won the war or lets say , defeat the nazis . 
  rather it was military manpower and machinery . 
  and on that very day , the 70 celebration , it is okay to show of and honor the russian military , imo . 
  it has nothing to do with a `` we are strong and fuck you all '' mentality . 
  but yea , on the other hand , and the out of context today politics , a military parade looks misplaced . 
  that is the very reason merkel wasn \u00b4 t attending the happening . 
  bad , bad publicity . 
  sad but true . 
  * sigh * yes , we high german speaking people giggle a little internally , when we met people with a saxon or bavarian accent but suppress it with a heart warming , friendly smile ;p, 
  sooo , you go to restaurants where the cook takes a bite from your steak ? 
  i learned to laugh about that word by bending the truth  [ `` selfie '' is actually an acronym of selfi * sh * e * gomaniac * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcjpags7jt8 ), 
  well , the main point is that she stopped her education due to discrimination . 
  no apprenticeship , how many years she lost ? 
  the compensations are totally okay . 
  she cooked pork , thats a plus . 
  forcing her to eat it wasn \u00b4 t necessary . 
  picky teacher who made a big thing out of it . 
  the extortion `` eat it , or it has an impact on your education '' is pretty hilarious . 
  what has quality to do with eating something or not ? 
  ... exactly , nothing at all . 
  the question is , was it tasty or not ? 
  : \u00b4 d first i thought , `` damn cool selection '' . 
  then i clicked on eesti and bursted into laughter ... i \u00b4 ve laught through that whole title . 
  . . seriously man , u \u00b4 ve made my day : \u00b4 ddd, 
  drink up me hearties . 
  here is one for [ europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgez9e3wikq ), 
  there are so much uncertainties , my head starts to hurt with such question . 
  gim me 5month to think through it ... for sure you have to pay me for it ;d but estonia gets the ministry of stately cuteness . 
  a sub-division for foreign politics . 
  however , reality is boring . 
  all those single figureheads will become a council of its own . 
  pluralism n \u00b4 shit . 
  you know ?!, 
  but for a broad encirclement , i give a shit about nationalties . 
  put the smartest scientists , philosophers and wise men in charge . 
  get rid of stubborn lawyers , reactionary dayflies or religion etc. 
  in politics , who rush for might , just for the emotional drive , for the funding , for 3rd party interests , for the feeling of power , before they know how to handle it . 
  ( ehhm . . the might :d . . iam lost in translation ) * if one day * europe * unites * and someone * dominates * , plenty hords of individualists won \u00b4 t like him either way . 
  even though he/she is the right one for this work . 
  thats the fucking story about demo * crazy *, 
  iam definitly not pro-war . 
  but it would be nice if those rebels just enlist to the army . 
  no command , no supervision , definitly no ethics . 
  just war hounds on the loose . 
  i don \u00b4 t like populism . 
  they could have come up with reparation claims decades ago . 
  its the exact same thing the other way around , when german lowbobs claim we gift those lazy greeks bln $ . 
   oh whatever . 
  same thing that could \u00b4 ve been me :d, 
  sure , austrians are used to get kidnapped and live in a basement for some time . 
  * ouch *, 
  my own, 
  * anymore * since 12 . 
  december 2014 the law came into force . 
   maybe you should start giving trust to the judiciary in the same way you give it to the politicians . 
  iam already at that mindset to trust noone   separation of powers = seperate paychecks, 
  a little cottage with a nice sea view and we have a deal :d, 
  kind of a mexican standoff situation , isn \u00b4 t it ? 
  stay with swapping time . 
  but only with the winter time . 
  every year we win one hour . 
  edit : its actually winter time i think . 
  til, 
  finally a redditor with a sense of humor . 
   and enlightened too . 
  have a nice day , dude . 
  whyyyyy . 
  did jesus * slept * longer in romania ?
