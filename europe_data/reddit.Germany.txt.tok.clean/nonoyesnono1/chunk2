  `` the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers . '' -- thomas jefferson, 
  for u.s. interests its a thin line . 
  on one hand not support assad , while on the other battle isis . 
  almost pradaox how to behave in that situation . 
  the oppornunistical usage of isis could be `` the foe of our foe is our friend '' . . but then again isis might be the bigger threat, 
  its your own fucking problem . 
  simple people have simple problems . 
  feel free to move to a 100 % bigoted british area . 
  the world isn \u00b4 t rotating around you . 
  see , my world is pretty simple , i love to hate all people the same way . 
  what \u00b4 s written on that posters ? 
  btw , iam so fucking amazed how our chancellor gets all around the world . 
  long live the queen ... oh wait ;d, 
  you don \u00b4 t need a british to explain that . 
  simple like everywhere else , common voters are short sighted and reactionary . 
  if they want to leave over the refugee topic , they deserve it . 
  narrowing the whole e.u. 
  referendum to that topic is completly dumb . 
  `` feed people with dumb things , and they \u00b4 ll do and say dumb things . '', 
  edit : i know the mirror hurts . 
  feel free to feel offended - . - ... pssshh , who cares, 
  :p [ ... know ye my colours ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmjmkavoj1e ) 5 . verse where love and loyalty are devoted to the king where prince and people take each other by the hand there the happiness of the people must thrive , there the beautiful fatherland flourishes and grows . 
  so we swear anew love and loyalty to the king !, 
  the bond is strong !, 
  yes , take it up bravely !, 
  we are prussians , let it be so !, 
  the bond is strong !, 
  yes , take it up bravely !, 
  we are prussians , let it be so !, 
  sure it was expected . 
  what else you expect when you destabilze a country , wanting to get rid of the ruler - hint , assad . 
  and on the other hand keeping the eyes closed and make opportunistic moves , by doing nothing , when a new radical movement appears . 
  remember how is came out in news . 
  like snapping a finger , all of the sudden they were big . 
  no emerging process or something in the news . 
  but in reality this takes a while . 
  and now , all the refugees are the collateral damage , while the destabilization goes on . 
  funny i got angry about someone insulting an eu country . 
  * waving flags is for peasants , staahp that *, 
  and i stucked to it for no reason . 
   got ` lost ' . 
  iam soo fucking bored out the europe frontpage . 
  do you really click all of them to not miss any of that min\u00fctlichen dreck den die klatschpresse rausballert . 
  echt , als ob da eine wall of one topic gives you any more than clicking all the precious links in one thread . 
  its the same . 
  entweder die leute interessieren sich and stick to it or they don \u00b4 t. 
  imagine the frontpage of reddit would have one fucking subreddit \u00fcber die komplette startseite . 
  boring as hell . 
  megathreads are working just like this - . -, 
  we have found the cast for a movie :d, 
  medvedev looks a little bit like dr.cox, 
  i really don \u00b4 t like how our media handles that topic . 
  i facepalm in every smalltalk when my colleagues repeating those numbers as if they are the exact number of new future citizens . 
  however the truth looks like [ this ] ( http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/197867/umfrage/abgelehnte-asylantraege-in-deutschland/ ) nearly 60-80 % of all applications for asylum are getting rejected every year . 
  i \u00b4 d expect the proposed fast processing of the applications , should bring a + / - 0 growth . 
  when germany sends the same amount back , of those you apply for asylum . 
  but hey , the average media consumer must click every shit to spew dirt in comment sections . 
  or worse , the uneducated far-right sets another camp ablaze . 
  reality is too boring to be sold . 
  we produce civil disobedience , overhyping a topic . 
  ... iam so sick of what the media has become . 
  [ all hail the ad-click-industry . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s60mtiwdvm ), 
  hahaha , that backfires fast , dear american ;d but yea , sure i can live with that . 
  eversince i prefered the british accent . 
  that show also has a kind of public education * sometimes * while being funny . 
  people like it, 
  isn \u00b4 t john oliver on hbo ? 
  btw , we need a show like last week today . 
  i bet the pope silently smiled when he read about that hack . 
  the press had a very lucrative summer-slump/sillyseason . 
  you are right, 
  [ a classical chloroform moment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mucyfl1_y ), 
  totally unrealistic charts . 
  who owns a crystal ball ? 
  especially for africa . 
  i expect some wars when the african unification process is growing pace when the health issues aren \u00b4 t solved . 
  a bigger population with lesser space , will let spread epidemics way faster and the major point , when they * develope * and the majority has decent incomes , and stately structures they \u00b4 ll will have * naturally * lesser kids . 
  a too lazy to fuck/have kids , consumer population . 
  like the most 1st world areas . 
  can confirm , from the other perspective . 
  motorized traffic on roads is just like tourists on sidewalks . 
  you get used to snaking ( durchschl\u00e4ngeln ) through all those things that slow you down in one way or another . 
  :d . . we behave relentlessly , but less harming , like car drivers . 
  and car drivers are just getting so pissed off of bike riders because they get jealous and see that we are actually faster than them  surely they will have `` a hitler-open-mic '' ( billburr ) about obeying traffic laws , that very moment . 
  ( edit : `` stand still , like me '' ;d ) sure its quite unrealistic for american proportions , except for and in big cities , but riding bike is sooo much faster and less nerve attritional . 
  ... ... . . something completly different but still traffic related have you heard about `` size matters '' ? 
  i \u00b4 d like to question the american attitude towards the suv culture . 
  big things , need big space . 
  a simple pragmatic thought brought me to it . 
  your cars are huuuuuge . 
  and if they wouldn \u00b4 t be so huuuuge , i \u00b4 d assume the traffic issue can be eased . 
  haven \u00b4 t done the math yet ( dear reddit ) . 
  but if you would cut , lets say , 16inches off of all suvs on the road right now , how much free road-space you \u00b4 d get out of it ? 
  no offense , just me being a statistic nerd . 
  yea , better crack down people who `` smuggle '' low value , simple food , instead of investigating corruption and bribery in the own rowes worth blns . 
  who needs anti-russian propaganda when they ridiculousy deliver it by their own ? 
  confiscate and silently , donate it to charity would be a better move . 
  but nope , let simple people suffer under the international dick measuring contest .
