  wooaa / u/spin0 , i have the feeling you know what you are talking about :d thanks , nice read ( had a few til ) edit : if you don \u00b4 t mind , i have a question . 
  when the opec has a market share of 40 % , who are the major non-opec players right now ? 
  / r/beershowerthoughts in 3 . .2 ... 1 ... [ fuckyeaitsweekend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phsxe117qy8 ), 
  the most funny thing about this . 
  can anyone remember the media hysteria 4-6 years ago where * scientists * said that oil lasts just for the next 35-40years , to subtle explain the high price . 
  hilarious in retro perspective . . it \u00b4 s less funny how an oligopol ( monopoly ) can up/down * rigging * the market by their liking . 
  `` demand & supply '' is dead . 
  just watch how easy it is to choke off the competitors ( fracking ) . 
  i mean , i don \u00b4 t like fracking at all , but the way they do it is like cheating the market, 
  who gives a shit about ethnicity . 
  an all-embracing indicator which the police should release is , `` do they live in poverty or not '' and only then you can talk about your simple minded racial profiling, 
   when iam allowed to have a harsh tone . 
  lets call them `` rant-responses '' . 
  i \u00b4 ll do the modjob . 
  just invite me and i handle all those whiny internet users, 
  0 punkte ( 19 % gef\u00e4llt das ) imo / r/europe has a bigger problem with ukraine trolls than russian trolls . 
  things like this won \u00b4 t hit the frontpage of europe for a reason . 
  but every shit about russia is up200votes in no time . 
  i mean , just watch it happen . 
  you can see it every fucin day . 
  one sided information ftw - . - and then people claim they have an actual opinion . 
  sure everyone is talking about all those russian troll farms , and how they work , and what they do . 
  but . 
  when was the last time you \u00b4 ve seen a `` putin is the best , russia strong '' tabloid on the / r/europe frontpage ? 
  . . never happened but everyone is pretending they are soo much and so geniously organized . 
  that \u00b4 s the 2nd `` what ? '', 
  today . 
  dude iam german , wtf is `` tummy sticks '' ? 
  by reading this , wtf . . we talked about sexual education and kisses and boners , is this about - do you mean - sticking the penis in some other dudes bellybutton ? 
  ... seriously ... sooo fucin lost in translation < -- brought to you by `` to lazy to google '' :d, 
  there is hard science , without any doubts . 
  and there is soft science , like opinion polls , with all those little buts you shouldn \u00b4 t read me like i chisel something in stone . 
  my exact thought while i was writing . . the little ^ but in the back of th head . 
  however , it must be a process than . 
  in younger years they are more likly - not knowing - lesbiens * for science * and later on , way more secure . 
  ... about men its quite simple . 
  do you get a boner from what you see or not ? 
  :d everything else , is not much more than a platonian love . 
   they look for posts/articles to comment on good point . 
  oh okay , u ment that . 
  but still i \u00b4 d reject that study with my personal observations i don \u00b4 t like to let people chose an answer ... . and lie :d, 
  what ? 
  yea , sure . 
  the first thing i remember about women/girls . 
  they are learning `` kissing '' together in younger years . 
  never heard it from two men/boys . 
  wait a second . 
  he used keywords like `` by studying searches for various `` political '' queries ( such as the words `` maidan , '' `` sanctions , '' `` referendum , '' and so on ) '' ... and the cities who searched that too are , in his opinion , places were trollfactories must be ? 
  . . hahaha . . that is some serious evidence right there . . lol show me polit-trolls who type in google `` maidan , sanctions . 
  etc '' . 
  this is bullshit . 
  less informed people using such terms is rather logical than otherwise . 
  when i use google and search fbi , is the location with the most searches , while being less populated , a secret fbi headquarter . 
  ... is there a point which i didn \u00b4 t understand ? 
  because this article and blogger are full of ... wasted time ... a click = ad-money . . huray ... everyone is happy - . - except me edit : this downvote/comment ratio . 
  lol ... at work, 
   it seems that most russian women are incredibly beautiful , or well slavic women in general really are . 
  ayyy . 
  i know big lovely eyes and sweet cheeks are my weak points . 
  their manners  and 60 \u00b4 s - 80 \u00b4 s rock, 
  awwwwww , 
  can \u00b4 t remember where i heard or watched it , but even the beatles played a role in breaching the iron curtain , with their [ * filthy , impure , rebellious * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khd5nd3qltg ) rock \u00b4 n roll . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  who can believe that [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3grxq39.jpg ) is a real terrorist ?!, 
  edit : what a bullshit and made up story ... all hail the clickindustry, 
  tbh , people nowadays are critical and sceptical more than ever . 
  i don \u00b4 t buy this `` the consumer is just an all shit eating mindless zombie '' anymore . . furthermore , hypocratical measures like `` propaganda machine ( a ) publishes shit , we need our own shit publishing propaganda machine . '', 
  what you get is just piling up shit . 
  the idea behind that intention is sick . 
  because it works on the same level . 
  instead of enlighten people they make use of the same thing , what was a second ago considered to be bad . 
  omg . 
  the way they speak sounds so scripted . 
  bad acting all the way . 
  the intonation makes it clear for me that they are reading off of something . 
  they are almost waiting for the other one to finish . 
  rush trough a line , little awkward pause , rushes the line , little awkward pause . 
  and that indicates on the other hand , that it wasn \u00b4 t issued from the state . 
  official agencies are way more proffessional than that . 
  fighting fire with fire . 
  that \u00b4 ll help to keep journalism independent - . -, 
  oh boy , monkey . 
  that is such a smooth line . 
  well put, 
  i won \u00b4 t complain how old your account is , because its like saying nothing at all . 
  fun fact . 
  even worldpolitcs ... guys , girls worldpolitics . . isn \u00b4 t constantly spewing so much anti-russian posts . 
  / r/europe is plastered with it . 
  since - i can \u00b4 t remember - ... since forever . 
  what those trollarmies don \u00b4 t understand . 
  when you push too hard , the nerve/interest gets killed . 
  there are a handful of redditors - i won \u00b4 t call any names - ho \u00b4 s only existence belongs to anti-russian tabloid links . 
  just ... just scroll ... its the internet . 
  not worth any megathread, 
   expect nationalism and fascism to rise again as it has at similar times in history ? 
  have you slept the last 6-7years . 
  it almost peaked already . 
  we \u00b4 ll see if the near future eases it or make it worse . 
  edit : fuckin summerreddit - . -, 
  what argument ?
