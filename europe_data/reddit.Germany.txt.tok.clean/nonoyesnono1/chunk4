  . . lol, 
  i dont think you understand that topic very well . 
  not worth any more words, 
  i wish springer press * idio * cated people like you would leave the internet once and for all . 
  that is the most dumb line a men can say  the greeks were very efficient in doing that all by themselves . 
  sure . 
  - . - because greek has such a huge negotiating position and stately handlungsfreir\u00e4ume ( gim me a word ) in that situation of unrepayable state bond interests . 
  sure the rats leave the boat first . 
  the big bln-nair money is gone since 08-09 . constantly leaving because the financial crisis has aparently a greek-dogma . 
  every fuckin paper writes '' * greek will fall , greek will fall , dont invest , greek will fall * '' . 
  and germany acts inflamatory lately , when sch\u00e4uble pulled the `` obey or get bankrupt '' card . 
  sch\u00e4uble fears for his balanced budget . 
  so that merkel says what a good boy he is * petpetpet * and do you expect a conservative right would let a left party succeed ?? 
  ... whatever, 
  why are you stealing content ? 
  and even a personality ? 
  [ -- ] jimrayaki3 [ s ] 20 punkte vor 5 tagen while three months of the journey alone i tried to make a video . 
  this is a video that was made in the thinking of funny stage only if kurere just followed to take to continue to the video for each city to travel . 
  when i pass through alone , most of the video , now shooting with the help of many people passing on the street .

  great points  but i love this country because i 've seen how we can put aside our differences and work together to get things done during times of crisis . 
  i think that unfortunately a lot of europeans do n't have that same attitude when it comes to completely separate countries in the eu ( as evidenced by the rhetoric surrounding the greek crisis ) , which makes it hard to feel that same collective pride . '', 
  thats the reason why i love big systems like the us too . 
  way easier in times of crisis to pull on one side of the rope . 
  also for legislation and such . 
  in europe however memberstates often fall back into old structures and behaviours . 
  you \u00b4 ll see more re-nationalisation instead of partiotism on a eu level . 
  sad , but this kind of selfishness is logical i think . 
  28 countries , each of them have 20 parties or so . 
  and they campaigning `` your live will be better '' on and in a national thought world . 
  the eu itself often becomes the political opponent in someones speeches . 
  it is soooooo fuckin hard to overcome this process . 
  eu politics is conceived as a far , far away politics without any real impact . 
  haha . . i said that once too . 
  they have a huge lack of * romantic * politics/ruling . 
  all they have are founding fathers and presidents . 
  afar from the legal topic . 
  the most reason why you should be sceptical in the first place is , it is free for windows users . 
  - because a bln-industry has something to donate , rite ?!, 
  :d . . lol ... there is a reason behind it - i think microsoft windows will turn into a simple app-storage . 
  they said it will be the last windows forever . 
  . . they \u00b4 ll make the money with windows-apps for sure . 
  in short they dismantle a well fitted and whole operation software ( windows ) and sell it in pieces . 
  better profits over time instead of selling yearly new windows versions . 
  and it looks so * consumer friendly * - tbh , annoyingly like a smartphone surface . 
  i bet , they try a comeback with a new windows phone some day . 
  yea but don \u00b4 t forget about the impact . 
  i \u00b4 d bet that he stays a welcome person of media in the near future . 
  people - yea and me too - like him . 
  just for his different approach . 
  it is not really about the parties its more a `` oh look , that is politics too ... well ... well ... well '' , afar from the daily imprinted tuff business about the money . 
  sure he \u00b4 s an idealist , but that is no argument , but to say , he says what he wants in some way or another . 
  sure it sound simplier , but who cares . 
  . . alone the fact that europe is talking about a lefty greek , 6 countries away - its made up , i have no idea how many countries are between germany and greece - , is a quite good education about understanding globalization and europe .

  reporter `` is there any mistake you made , in your opinion ? '', 
  varoufakis `` plenty . 
  if i would say to you that i didn \u00b4 t make any mistakes , i would be a very dangerous idiot '' :d i still like him . 
  he represents a * agile * european politics . 
  not too stiff , no cold blooded calculating , no businessman phrases . 
  edit : on a second thought . 
  i never heard a reporter say to merkel : `` is there any mistake you made , in your opinion ? '', 
  i miss it now . 
  cause it may press * other politicians * in the same manner . 
  ... fuckin second thoughts . 
  minijobs ruining the statistic, 
  since you \u00b4 ve said australia . 
  how old are you , btw ? 
  when you are young and just want to see the world , australia is known for its `` work-and-travel '' . 
  i think everythin up to half a year , the paperwork would be the easiest in australia . 
  elsewise , move to ireland instead of the u.k. , 
  arbitrariness or what ? 
  what is your problem ? 
   there are still no loafing and blocking ^ fucking tourists :d, 
  can any ukraine post the official law in english ?!, 
  and some more info about the `` why '' !? 
  edit : i \u00b4 ve found something . 
  since may 27 . . `` two new laws that ban communist symbols while honouring nationalist groups have come into effect in ukraine , thus banning communist symbols , singing the soviet national hymn or the internationale . '', 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_workers_and_peasants ) edit2 : but the right sector can still freeroam or what !?!? 
  sooooooooooo , is that russian tourist dude good or bad in ukrainian eyes ? 
  a bit of both i guess . 
  that shape looks cool . 
  don \u00b4 t know if i ate that or a different cheese . 
  but what i remember from polish markets is cheese and salami . 
  it was local stuff and it was great, 
  adam 's apples from denmark the green butchers also denmark :d, 
  i have the certain feeling that the next chancellor will be a man again . 
  don \u00b4 t ask me why , but i heavily expect it . 
  they have tested the public opinion already with highlighting von der leyen as the candidate . 
  ... but that failed hard . 
  if you compare mutti with uschi , uschi has a huge lack of competence . 
  i think that is a common conception . 
  flat speeches , bad appearance . 
  honestly , merkel could be chancellor until she \u00b4 s 80 :d . 
  i sure don \u00b4 t like everything she \u00b4 s doing but she emodies global politics pretty okay i \u00b4 d say . 
  iam pretty confident that she is really hard working off camera and public . 
  not like other chancellors/presidents . 
  she \u00b4 s quite a good dancer on many dancefloors . 
  keeping shit in germany together , keeping shit in the e.u. 
  together , appeasing u.s. , china , russia .
