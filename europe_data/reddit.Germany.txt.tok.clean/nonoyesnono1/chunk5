  ( in a broad meaning ) . 
  there is no fitting replacement for her right now , and in the near future . 
  because plenty ( they arent many in reality , tbh ) of reasons . 
  1 . the own household income , consume are the matter . 
  this monetary crisis isnt over , yet . 
  we totally forgot the last 7-8 years about the plan to reform the banking system and finance sectors . 
  scapegoating every day , all day . 
  - hi greece  . . let us play `` we-can-handle-this-crisis-or-at-least-distract-from-the-real-issues '' ;d . . : \u00b4 ( 2 . media . 
  europe has to accept that `` the modern living europe feeling '' is driven by everywheres youngsters , talking in broken english on the internet . 
  online videogames are for sure a sublim educator . 
  the mass however , the older people are still * learning * that new way of commuications . 
  the elderly stick mostly in there national/mothertoungh media and they are the mass in everyones nations . 
  and that is horrible to watch . 
  stearing up for ad money , the media sells every national stereotype as reality . 
  ^ pssssstdonttelltheold the former generations are more under media \u00b4 s spells . 
  and around our time now , everyone seems to have not enough money for a living , starting the simple hate against any foreigners , even within e.u. 
  terms foreign countries . 
  instead of fighting for a better living , simple people start to fight the next grabable , fucked people instead . 
  in short . 
  that \u00b4 s about it . 
  ohhh wait there is more . 
  our states are still competeing among themselfs , soacking the benefits from it - iam german , i know how to suffer from that cheerful prosperity everyone is talking about - . - . . with those side effects `` take a little , give a little , take some more germanys economical rise , is some other countries fall . 
  i know its hard to understand it else than financially , cause we fucking started an everyones touching campaign that it is about the $ . 
  noone has enough of it right now . 
  short sighted elses conclusion `` fuck the e.u. '', 
  now something completly different . 
  when greece had it referendum . 
  i was shewing all my fingernails :d . . the day after it felt almost like a sexual outcome , but statewise . 
  finally admitted to myself that iam european over being german . 
  ... last words - the ancient greeks taught me to think that way :d - . 
  people you say ? 
  having all them in mind ? 
  so clusterfucked , in diversity  i love it . 
  more than any other populated part of the worlde . 
  one second of thought for all costs me 15,8443823 years . 
  i have no time for that kind freetime . 
  should i think good or bad about them , in such a waste of time ? 
  we need a pragmatical workaround . 
  you better don \u00b4 t listen to me . 
  [ iam drunk , i love politics more than men and even women  ... dear europe :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on1pubgw9ai ), 
  so lets assume wiki is right . 
  `` according to a sample calculation average cost of 26.8 million euros per km of motorway may arise , of which one quarter construction costs and three-quarters are additional costs in germany . '', 
  that \u00b4 ll be around 100km new autobahn . 
  sure the 2.7 bln are mostly for `` instandhaltung '' ( upkeep ) . 
  but dont expect to much from that money . 
  it drains way to fast . 
  its expensive over here - . -, 
  hey op i don \u00b4 t like your version of your hymn . 
  take [ that one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddoepfypwqa ) your version \u00b4 s orchestra and choir is way to thin :d, 
  what is your troll factories name ? 
  your postin history looks hilarious, 
  1st greece has around 60-70 % turnouts . 
  what i mean with that , people didn \u00b4 t even care right now enough . 
  2nd and most . 
  blackmailing people to accept a shitty job ( any job ) , just for voting rights is a bad , bad idea !, 
  i don \u00b4 t know greece that well , but this is how you get a military coup . 
  people turn away from politics even more . 
  even worst , they would openly fight that government . 
  ... can i scratch yours and your dads voting rights for being feudal , pls ? 
  - ;d , kidding -, 
  btw , greece wanted the imf out , because their interests are too high . 
  it is on worldnews too . 
  i have to repost this dude / u/post _ break , saying  i would love see this with two huge ripped russian dudes . 
  see how many people start shit with some big russian bears haha . 
  the most recent thing that would happen are early elections . . - would be awesome to see syriza back , again :d - in the meantime of those elections , i have no idea how it would be managed . 
  you have to be a dictator to get things done in 5month . 
  all the shit other governments signed , knowing they won \u00b4 t be relected , are now the burden of a left party . 
  its like france . 
  finances went down the shitter , sarcozy was gone , and hollande was facing all the anger , in no time . 
  lol . 
  i just said what your source is saying ... sooo who cares what you think its not just universally accepted its just logic, 
  it contains nothing more than the word `` debt reconstruction '' while having the grexit over a period of time . 
  sch\u00e4uble hasn \u00b4 t said anything about a `` how '', 
  i think i know how the market works . 
  now explain how a grexit would raise the wages - . - to gain demand . 
  greek would be cheaper than ever . 
  export would rose in % but not in value , imports unreal pricetags . 
   a new devalued currency can \u00b4 t have an effect when the loans are still accounted in $ \u00b4 s. 
  i highly doubt that the lenders will swap the loans to a drachme2 .0 , because it would be like a debt relief when greece can juggle the currency up and down, 
  [ tsipras proposal from 22.06 . . look at page 11 ] ( http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/protasi--2.pdf ) i mean it when i said it looks identical, 
  this looks identical to the first proposal , wonder why the troika said `` okay '' this time !?!, 
  it was issued for 2016, 
  my lazyness starts at those three dots . 
  just the first part was for you :d to recap some proposals, 
  you haven \u00b4 t even read the proposal , right ? 
  if that is the last proposal , it should stating they wanted a one-time-tax of 12 % for companies with profits 500k + , and they wanted to raise the business taxes from 26 % to 28 % . 
  ( edit : actually 29 % ) they wanted to raise ( reform ) the vat ( value-added tax ) . 
  lower the military budget 200m raises for social security and reform retirements ... i just don \u00b4 t understand why everyone is implying that the syriza hasn \u00b4 t issued anything ?!!?!? 
  wan na know why ? 
  because the troika is saying oxi all the time behind the curtains . 
  sure the greek government can \u00b4 t do shit without an okay from the troika right now . 
  but to say they haven \u00b4 t done anything is just plain wrong . 
  they would , if they would be allowed to do so . 
  but instead we manifest the idea that the government failed - totally ignoring the last one - and that every greek is a cheeky , lazy bastard . 
  this looks more like , 60 in a row , 20 rows . 
  60 * 20 * 100 $ ( ben was 100right ) . . so 120k, 
  tbh , this looks ridicul . 
  to fan out all the single notes to make it look huuuuuuuuuuuuuge :d, 
  thanks, 
  that makes no sense .
