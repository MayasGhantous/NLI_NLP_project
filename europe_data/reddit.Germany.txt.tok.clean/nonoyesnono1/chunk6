  silver dollar , gold standard or the spanish dollar ? 
  ( offtopic ) i fucking hate those ticker/life feeds in the online-newspapers . 
  literally all they are doing is browsing twitter or other tabloids and spam that 24/7 . 
  sooo god damn useless . 
  as if it is like `` any second there will be a solution '' ... german newspaper do the same retarded shit . 
  euro - replacement of old debts 48,2 mrd . 
  euro - bank restructuring 40,6 mrd . 
  euro - interest payments 34,6 mrd . 
  euro - haircut 2012 11,3 mrd . 
  euro - repurchase of debt 9,1 mrd . 
  euro - repayments to the imf 2,3 mrd . 
  euro - payments into the esm 27,0 mrd . 
  euro - state spending activity ... source of numbers : macropolis http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2015-02/eurokrise-griechenland-eu-hilfen-grafik ... as you can see . 
  only 27bln . 
  $ were used for the states purpose . 
  all the other bln \u00b4 s are just loan payments and went straight back into the banking sector . 
  40bln plain interest < -- sick so yea , we never financed any growth , just paying debts , with more debts . 
  business as usual - . -, 
  you are late . 
  cheap buy-ins happen since \u00b4 08 . 
  yes , i got the reference before i had read this post . 
  :d damn , yesterdays witchhunting was unbelievable . 
  i pretend to myself they were all 14y/o \u00b4 s because i don \u00b4 t want to believe that adults behave like this - . - if that is what drives people , they sure have no big problems in life . 
  now imagine , all those people have voting rights ... * shudders * ... frightening . 
  its not just the phd . 
  its the geology . 
  its rare , because that shit is boring , if you aren \u00b4 t really into it , just like physics or chemistry . 
  explorer needs them , and other companies due to environmental standards and such . 
  however , such wage is already upper middleclass . 
  sepp , his name is sepp, 
  lets * thing * a * thong * ... . whaaaaat ? 
   they want to have the choice shortest summary about that whole topic . 
  normally this sub is pretty decent . 
  but sometimes low iq propaganda happens . 
  some * religious * \u00b2 make opportunistic use of extreme forces . 
  ... to be exact but i don \u00b4 t give a fuck about `` some '' . 
  i bet the majority of muslims is as scared about the violence like all the other people . 
  and that is the reason why they don \u00b4 t speak up so openly what do you think is the broad effect of this so called `` extremism '' ? 
  i would expect ordinary muslims to be even more scared , than non , or other religious people . 
  everyone knows how hard it is to offend the own community . 
  and how easy it is to point fingers at others from the outside . 
  i \u00b4 d really assume that it goes like `` fuck , iam muslim too . 
  when i speak up , iam the first victim '' \u00b2 every fuckin conviction . 
  iam with you . 
  fuckin sad that such posts have the most upvotes . 
  and then i have to convince myself again somehow that we don \u00b4 t live in an idiocracy already .

  when you mean the mob of childish truculence , then yes . 
  i \u00b4 ve noticed that , 
   currency conversion is an amazing way to lose a lot of money without realising . 
  currency conversion was an amazing kind of business , doing nothing but changeing the currency . 
  since it was mandatory to shop anywhere else . 
  what a safe haven for a * business * it was someone should do the math on how much the banking sector approx . 
  lost since the conversion is gone . 
  ( when there are numbers about that topic , message me pls  ),
