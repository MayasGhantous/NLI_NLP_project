  1st major difference lays in taxation . 
  and then , when you would look up actual prices , they differ a lot . 
  take prices for essential things like the price for a kw/h and gas/per liter , before you get into a `` but an iphone costs the same '' - . -, 
  but ... but russia is the devil ... now bury me with upvotes , i want to feel accepted . . pet my ego you fuckers ;d, 
  iam somehow surprised that the u.s. is just 44 % . 
  that doesn \u00b4 t reflect the stereotype of rhapsodic patriotism . 
  . . lol @ swiss :d, 
  why you want to move to sweden for 4times the loan , when beer , alcohol in general , costs 8times as much ?? 
  ; dd zero-sum game case closed, 
  wow . 
  the / all page looks like a troll battlefield . 
  what is wrong with stupid people ? 
  freedom of speech does not allow hatespeech . 
  pretty simple to understand . 
  but 14y/o internetwarriors can \u00b4 t comprehend such terms - . - taking `` freedom '' literally contains a huge lack of logic - . -, 
  thats why i love turkish . 
  i \u00b4 ve a friend named `` the first sunlight at dawn '' ... and she is that lovely too : dd, 
  ... kissed my new boss the french way , with tongue , 3times , got fired the first day . 
  ... instructions unclear, 
  party?sight seeing?nature ? 
  ... when you swear not to amble on the bike lanes , you are allowed to visit netherlands , denmark and germany . 
  mhh . . a standard political phrase . 
  or do you wan na hear something like , `` germany is a better ally , but you are still okay , france . 
  ( . . proceeds the speech ) '' xd that shit would be too funny . 
  the 1st returning question would be `` what did you just said '' . 
  and see all the tabloids producing a political conflict around it :d and the internet is spewing in anger about it . 
  i don \u00b4 t feel good when i call people dumb , but i have no fear to do so . 
  without knowing your arguments , i can reject them in advance just by taking the opposit p.o.v. 
  because beside of `` she \u00b4 s putins girl '' you \u00b4 ll find enough people who \u00b4 d say `` she \u00b4 s obama \u00b4 s girl '' now guess what . 
  both sides are wrong with those cheap shots . 
  because she \u00b4 s hollande \u00b4 s girl !, 
   ... clearly this isn \u00b4 t real either . 
  global politics is more then that . 
  when you are okay with softcore fascism , then yes :(, 
  i wonder why you get downvotes - . - maybe your * anwser * is just plain dumb !, 
  have you guys actually read that piece ?!, 
  nothing but overdrawn assumptions without any clarification of such . 
  you sure you know how to handle informations ? 
   clickbaiting as usual . 
  mission accomplished . 
  people are clicking , sharing , talking about * nothingatall * everything else wasn \u00b4 t wanted . 
  a click is enough . 
  just anger and piss off people , that \u00b4 s how it works, 
  way better, 
  so the idea is scratched ?!, 
  great . . now i can browse in my normal pace again . 
  thank you edit : haven \u00b4 t scrolled on the europe frontpage . 
  they are still there . . fuck - . - please get rid of them . 
  the most controversy classification is `` news/opinions '' . 
  show me news which are not carrying an opinion most of the time . 
  the tag `` opinion '' has a degrading character for no actual reason . 
  ... if you still want to keep the tags . 
  put that fucking colorcode aside . 
  make it grey and way tinier . 
  a less aggressive pre-selective imprint so that the actual post/source is still the first focus . 
  i \u00b4 d say that those tags cost clicks . 
  take `` european union '' for example . 
  this sounds so officially , boring and dusty that consumers get scared away . 
  :d and this tagging ends up being useless . 
  i bet we \u00b4 ll see same sources/topics re-posts with different tags . 
  edit2 : now that i \u00b4 ve scrolled through . 
  it bugs me too that all the posts aren \u00b4 t lined up anymore and i have to shift my view . 
  the sides formatting is ruined . 
  all or nothing please :d ... yes , its about the little things . 
  pretty interesting how wide spread this series is . 
  i re-watched it since decades , while i was searching for the intro . 
  and i was amazed how much production logos it has . 
  but french is written all over it . 
  wonder what happend to those studios !, 
  :d ... mods having fun i think dcauzel was a good choice . 
  :d [ and this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx1omoa7sfk ) those little guys who carried all the time the oxigen , telling stories, 
  thanks   fair enough . 
  yea well , honesty n \u00b4 stuff :d even though i just called myself to be too stupid for that issue :d, 
  my appeals only cause was a `` nsfw '' - tag . 
  because my dinner and open wounds are incompatible i didn \u00b4 t wanted to be engaged in that whole discussion , because i don \u00b4 t know enough about it . 
  `` nsfw '' please . 
  way too gory, 
  `` ever tried to grab into a naked mans pockets ?! '', 
  a pretty ridicul piece of law . 
  this enforcement costs probably more than building cheap apartments for homeless . 
  that whole from a-to-z chain costs how much ? 
  policemen writing the fine . 
  dude can \u00b4 t pay . 
  is brought to the court and ends up in jail . 
  i mean , who did the math on this ? 
  a quote for the last point from bill burr . 
  `` ahhh , we \u00b4 re not going to the church today , son . 
  fuck that . 
  it \u00b4 s all a bunch of bullshit . 
  god is everywhere but i have to go down there to see him ? 
  really ? 
  and he \u00b4 s mad at me down there and i owe you money ? 
  go fuck yourself ! '', 
  oh lol . . i remember a documentation about your cork industry . 
  the wine industry would be screwed without you ^ ^, 
  oh ffs , not this picture . 
  it took me 3weeks with my psychologist to remind me that iam not into gilf ; ddddd, 
  lately there was a us/greek depression recovery chart too , right ?!, 
  this and the other comparisons charts are totally useless . 
  there are so much unique and different factors that you just can \u00b4 t overlay two graphs over a period of time and try to deviate something from it - . - just , this one took more/less time , knowing no background whatsoever ... useless data junk,
