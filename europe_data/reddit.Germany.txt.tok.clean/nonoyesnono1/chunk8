  recently i watched [ french music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcdp-zbicu8 ) where the whole video just showed the lyrics . 
  and i thought that those `` sing alongs '' are super supportive to learn a language . 
  especially for pronounciation . 
  you don \u00b4 t have to sing . 
  make it a read along just take a `` music genre '' you like . 
  put `` german '' in front of it , plus `` lyrics '' at the end and browes some music . 
  [ anything ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7z4bpwdquw ) in return . 
  iam still not satisfied with that source . 
  :d you want political enlightment ? 
  you better serve informations by yourself :p . . shortend is the key . 
  twitter sized or it doesn \u00b4 t get acknowledged . 
  noone has time anymore . 
  provide some background info of her . 
  i have a right to learn . 
  name , party , opinions . 
  gim me anything, 
  mhh ... thats exactly what i heard . 
  but it sound like he was mubling a bit more . 
  thx, 
  * how to fuck with people * `` dear mr. beethoven , your music is soo bad i bet you \u00b4 ll become deaf from it someday . '', 
  `` dear joseph , i fucked your wife '' :d, 
  `` dear marie , please wear a metallic full body suite when you work with that stuff . 
  it is poisonous . 
  trust me . 
  sincerly nonoyesnono '', 
  can anyone tell me what he exactly said ? 
  i think i get the joke but i can \u00b4 t understand the middle part :(, 
  had a great laugh :d greets him as `` dictator '' with a lifted right arm . 
  shakes hands like a gangster , slaps him ... refreshing :d, 
  for the brit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gfk, 
  at least be assured it will bear a name which needs a prey for a living :d, 
  that might be true but it is and was actually enough that the media issued that topic . 
  the media highlighted it so much that casuals are getting * paranoid * . 
  every unwelcome opinion must be a paid agent now . 
  but the truth is . 
  there are enouh legions of unpaid volunteers to do this job . 
  you don \u00b4 t need to pay people that they are rigging votes , manipulating discussions and so on . . the most `` work '' is done by `` peasant \u00b4 s opinions vs. peasant \u00b4 s opinions '' ;d the real agents can lean back now and watch the digital world burn - . - not more not less . 
  everyone is suspicious now . 
  gg media outlets . 
  poisened the international communication from the scratch . 
  because peasantry logic works like `` oh there are paid agents ? 
  ! . . this very unpopular opinion must be one of them . . all of them are paid who disobeys my ( edit : partial ) opinion '' - . - ( read this with the most cynical salt u can ), 
  maybe one of the reason he hated expressionism and called it `` entartete kunst '' . 
  because his art wasn \u00b4 t good enough . 
  dude , we are onto something here . 
  maybe ... just maybe if the academy would have let him study , he would never been in politics . 
  ... be right back * starting the time machine *, 
  i love that modern feminism has no other problems . 
  aren \u00b4 t there any relevant issues ? 
  or is everything equal . 
  you know what piss me off . 
  that `` europa '' is a women . 
  its so strong , and glorious i want her to be a man . 
  he \u00b4 s a man now and we call him `` eurodick '' - . - . . fuck yea manlyness swings maybe its time that manhater stfu eventually . 
  i looked at the map and thought about moving to one of those blue areas . 
  ... and about learning portugese, 
  it \u00b4 s hard to get a joke without smileys or / s / j / i maybe my post was a joke too :p, 
  ;d fucksy . . you caughtskowiz me in the actov, 
  i \u00b4 ve another [ meta ] . 
  this sub is constantly growing by subscribers . 
  at least 2-3k in a few days . 
  but still the average attendants range stucks at the same level between 150-700users . 
  max 1000 on `` brigarding days '' so it is growing but not really . 
  your post is one of the * quality * examples , sauronvonkrautkraft ment . 
  because he said `` there is an anti-russian pressure made by [ ... ] '' makes him pro-putin , right ?!, 
  tbh , i read it kinda german because its so long . 
  and it reads so smoth that i \u00b4 d say i can learn swedish better when you stick to wordclusters :d, 
  simple simon * says `` oh well '' and everybody is saying `` oh well '' ( * russia/ukraine ) and all the consumers on both sides are harsh to an open end . 
  in every fucking thread the discussion looks like pure shit . 
  honestly never forget , in times of war the first victim is the truth . 
  iam often disgusted , and bored . 
  all day everyday framing the foe , with every daily tabloid one could rip apart or having a feast . 
  yes , the range goes from lie , half truth half lie , half lie half truth , to truth . 
  and ? 
  what now ? 
  but all the reactions look the same . 
  if its pro ukraine . 
  sure blueyellow defends it , whitebluered is making stupid jokes . 
  if its pro russia . 
  sure whitebluered defends it , blueyellow is making stupid jokes . 
  not one thought dedicated to a better tomorrow . 
  grow up , at least for politics . 
  - even the old people in here - tl : dr 24/7 just defending/attacking sources , the real topic isn \u00b4 t the focus anymore . 
  better start on your own , to talk about peace instead being up in arms in a seconde just because of the media . 
  the most unseen quote on internet communications ?! . . 
  one says to the other `` mhh okay , i was wrong , and you were right '' ;d . . just stop defending your ego or the nations ego . 
  be a better man !, 
  [ cheers . . fuckers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd_1esoxipi ), 
   the idea and the form are totally clich\u00e9 too true  the right to censor it it differs when its on a public place . 
  no one would care if this installation would be in a gallery . 
  idk . 
  tbh , i wouldn \u00b4 t go back in time . 
  changing places with a king or emperor sounds romantic but fuck it . 
  horses , carriages , mail takes forever , no internet , no tv , no new media . 
  seriously i would be bored in a week , missing all the information input i can \u00b4 t barely process even now :d and all of a sudden i \u00b4 d die to syphillis because my pig-colon-condom wasn \u00b4 t safe enough on that one night i had to much absinth . 
  and for the later decade . 
  dudes , democracy is democracy . 
  argueing with parties over and over and over again ... iam not doing it right now , so there is no chance that i \u00b4 d do it back then . 
  the only fun time with time traveling would be , to bring all the big names and heroes to our time and see them probably go insane because they can \u00b4 t handle it . 
  hang on a minute .
