  what are you planning ?!, 
  first things first . 
  better than wasting time on internet strangers :d, 
  do you made them just now ?!, 
  make one with the prussian eagle . 
  because monarchy , you know :d, 
  thank you . 
  i would have never come to that conclusion :d * art * idrink a beer soon . 
  its actually a performance art . 
  the beer stands for all the wars on the planet , the drinking part means iam willingly swallow it . 
  the empty bottle symbolizes peace . 
  then i grab another beer until iam totally hammered . 
  filled up with all the wars , almost intoxicated . 
  and fell asleep . 
  waking up with a headache . 
  having 7empty bottles on the table , worth a few cent of pawn ;d * art *, 
  wonder why it isn \u00b4 t called `` kerry urges every russian to implement minsk '' , 
  fuck you all and your fancy coat of arms ^ justkidding +1 for portugal . 
  fits perfect, 
  soooo , what was the intention behind that ? 
  him being jesus ? 
  or a `` do it like the romans , guys . 
  and hammer some nails in . 
  that \u00b4 ll teach him . 
  just crucify '' ?!, 
  i didn \u00b4 t really get any other impressions . 
  i really like that man . 
  competent , honest , sometimes a harsh tone . 
  one of a few politicians whom i would like to have as a mentor . 
  :d . . from the article . . * `` it is high time that politicians put aside their near addiction to opinion polls to tweak policy here and there and instead rediscover the style of addressing challenges and opportunities head on with lasting solutions as objectives . 
  we can see the destructive effects of politicians who , rather than lead by determination , anxiously look over their shoulders allowing other more destructive forces to set the agenda . 
  had 8 % and was way to spicy . 
  tasted almost like a liquer * shudders *, 
  send me all your local beer and i rank them throughout this year ;d in a best500 european beer, 
  i think the most european thing is the potato . 
  it was imported from south america ... ages ago, 
  :d i just added an - ian to every state :d, 
  in short . 
  have all your own national problems in mind , but in 28 different languages . 
  that \u00b4 s understanding europe . 
  politically seen . 
  `` fuck yea we are americans , but then again iam more wisconsinian , texasian , mississippian , new yorkian , californiaian . '', 
   it \u00b4 s a strange meddleing for or against , more than often , the same thing . 
  pointing fingers is way easier over here . 
  hateing the e.u.-level is an welcome and overused scapegoat for every national `` parteienlandschaft '' ( landscape of parties ) . 
  but back to the problems . 
  they are indeed the same . 
  its all about the security of the simple man . 
  - more unemployed than available jobs . 
  - the so called `` crisis '' is still alive - shrinking common wealth - dismantling of the social - and welfare states being - debts , debts , debts and even more debts - religious maniacs vs religious maniacs like everywhere else - fucking fanclubs , still loving one god , laughable - - the more jobs and wealth is going down , the merrier people and nations grow fascism inside . 
  ... all the same ... everywhere the cheapest excuses are `` its the $ \u00b4 s fault '' , fuck the eu '' . 
  sad politics everywhere . 
  noone wants to lead . 
  a man who \u00b4 s allowed to speak to several hundreds of millions . 
  :d european politics have a need for sure, 
  the u.s. and canada have an open ear for that topic . 
  they share the same problems, 
  which eagle ? 
  do you mean the [ eagle ] ( http://www.flags.de/animierte-flaggen-gif/flaggen-preussen.html ) from the northern cool german bros ? 
  or that fucking southern [ fascist eagle ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:parteiadler_der_nationalsozialistische_deutsche_arbeiterpartei_%281933%e2%80%931945%29_%28andere%29.svg ) or the common [ screaming cock ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/bundesadler_bundesorgane.svg ), 
  you smartarse ;d iam was the cook here who built the bridge to an island . 
  they have nothing in hand . 
  i placed an ad for them too  . . now its your turn :p, 
  at first european politics must be deeper intergrated into the nations . 
  look at all your national voting turnouts at first . 
  the interest in tools of a democracy aren \u00b4 t sufficient . 
  now span that on the e.u. 
  level . 
  those numbers would be horribly low . 
  `` more democractic '' is all fun and games . 
  but when the least attend it stays nothing but a good will . 
  flags on the hood actually looking pretty cool, 
  nonono , you do your homework alone . 
  * cough * can we see the footage of the imbedded street camera when the female division walked by . 
  hard to believe they released such manufactured photo . 
  it hurts to look at it . 
  next time ask / r/photoshopbattles and wait for some bored 14year olds to do it better :d, 
  thx  for your time and the free education . 
  some of the proposals look really awesome . 
  i would have chosen [ this one ] ( http://5outubro.centenariorepublica.pt/images/stories/simbolos/flags/23_augusto_jorge_fernandes_casanova.jpg ) but without those , what looks like , burning bombs in the corners :d . . and yes , my lack of portugese history couldn \u00b4 t handle that blue and white . 
  . . until now  that was the [ only ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/portuguese_carracks_off_a_rocky_coast.jpg ) different flag i knew from portugal . 
  seen in various simulation games . 
  thought it was just a marine flag . 
  let me guess . 
  you miss the union jack in the corner [ ;d ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/flag_of_the_cook_islands.svg ), 
  maybe it \u00b4 s because iam used to your current flag but those blue & white ones look way to cold for portugal . 
  you drove 200km to vote ?!, 
  someone should pay you to be a role model for democracy :d, 
  the u.k. won \u00b4 t leave the eu . 
  i see the idea behind that referendum more as an populistic act , the tories used , to gather all the votes of the eu-sceptics . 
  things really have to go bad within the next 2 years that this referendum has the slighest chance . 
  anything known how much vw pays its workers ?!, 
  way above the average or do they use the dropped spanish salaries ? 
  were they given any tax abatements ? 
  the investment sounds great . 
  but it also says it \u00b4 s going into their already exisiting factories . 
  so , just a few more assembly-lines i guess . 
  the impact for creating jobs should be marignal . 
  a few are still better than nothing , right ? 
  :d a package full of your local spiders and snakes is higher on my wishlist .
