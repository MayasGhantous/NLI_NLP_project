  we do n't have freedom of speech ?!,

  i have three flag poles and fly my football clubs flag , the german flag and the eu flag . 
  banned ? 
  they did it themselves . 
  you can post it on / r/yurop where mods are not nazis .

  oh god you have rtl , too ? 
  we currently have a casus belli : border friction with them . 
  maybe solve that problem once and for all ?

  here 's the / r/de post : https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/5v4xa5/life_in_germany_vs_life_in_the_united_states/, 
  mega is neither from schulz nor his party . 
  it 's from a circlejerk sub . 
  [ when the party comrades ask where all the brakes went ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oki9ofzl.jpg ), 
  that 's because we like the french .

  no royalty for me . 
  we got rid of them for good . 
  well . . a border,
