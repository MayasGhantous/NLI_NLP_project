that not funny !, 
  non of this is funny !, 
  if you can find the poke-flute ... 
  op once again confirmed as a bundle of sticks ... 
  he 's full of shit ... 
  i hope your last sentence was a joke , at least regarding current germany . 
  you slovakians are so polite, 
  that 's what they want you to believe ... 
  i 'd bet that most of their support comes from outside of bavaria ... 
  official language : anything but proper german , or as it is now known `` sau-preu\u00dfisch '', 
  it took us more than a 1000 years to get united , i do n't think anyone would seriously consider it . 
  a car accident at a military exercise is big enough to be on the front page of / r/europe ? 
  the `` to-go '' variant in bread is the berlin version , in turkey `` d\u00f6ner '' means just the meat, 
  for germany my top candidates would be : - [ sauerbraten ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sauerbraten ) - [ schnitzel ] ( http://www.hna.de/bilder/2010/09/16/920631/231841903-schnitzel-panieren-kochen-1ajkhmh34.jpg ) - the berlin version of [ d\u00f6ner ] ( http://www.liveforthepump.de/sites/default/files/d%c3%b6ner.jpg ) - fresh rye bread out of a stone oven , even without any covering it 's one of my favorite meals , add bacon and you 're in heaven, 
  the leopard 2a6 has a ( relatively ) [ new 120 mm gun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rheinmetall_120_mm_gun#rheinmetall_l55_120mm ) , the british army even considered replacing the current gun of the challenger 2 , but finally decided against it , because the cost would 've been to high to justify the increased performance . 
  the rheinmetall 120 mm cannon is so good that even the us army installed it in their abrahams , even though they 're using an older , slightly shorter version . 
  still , those three tanks are definitely better than any other tank out there , and far better than anything russia could send into battle . 
  the canadians are using leopards in afghanistan . 
  but it does n't matter if a tank has seen actual combat or not . 
  the leopard has the same armament as the abrahams and the challenger 2 , a better engine and cannon than both of them , it can cross rivers up to 4 meters deep , while the other two tanks need bridges for that . 
  additionally , almost every nation choses to order the leopard 2 if they have choice between the 3 . 
  the leopard 2 is currently the best main battle tank . 
  even though the european nations spend only a moderate amount on their military , if you combine the uk , france and germany alone you have an enormous army and even nuclear capabilities . 
  if there ever would be a serious threat of war ( wo n't happen ) , the defense budgets would see massive improvements . 
  also , i believe some countries ( germany f.e. ), 
  have stored older hardware that could be used in an emergency scenario . 
   nothing in his reasoning makes sense in this video . 
  maybe we just lack the freedom to understand him ? 
  sounds a lot like a 15 year old making threats on the internet . 
  their problem is the world knows that they 're bluffing , while the economic damage for them increases with every additional dumb statement . 
  one could say that the nazis were pretty nazi about it, 
  the concept for the deutsche mark was developed in a small village called rothwesten ( near kassel/hesse ) . 
  a dictator/regime annexing a region of another country under the pretense that the locals want to join / need to be saved . 
  it 's a scheme used to demonstrate strength and create an us-versus-the-west scenario . 
  the annexation of crimea is the next step after he spend the last decades implementing [ gleichschaltung ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleichschaltung ) . 
  sudetenland 2.0 i hope we 've learned enough from history not to repeat it, 
  the law bends around his ego like light around a black hole, 
  what a sad and pathetic person, 
  ha , you just said that a turtle took your virginity, 
  that 's a funny way to spell germany, 
   kerry said : `` the aspirations of citizens are once again being trampled beneath corrupt , oligarchic interests - interests that use money to stifle political opposition and dissent , to buy politicians and media outlets , and to weaken judicial independence . '', 
  is he talking about ukraine or his own country ? 
  the only difference right now seems to be that the ukrainian people are fighting for their rights ... 
  because everything was going great before , right ? 
  but is n't this what a good tv debate is about ? 
  yelling without listening and in the end everyone is angrier while having learned absolutely nothing . 
  most people falsely view a debate as a convenient tool to force their opinion into the heads of others . 
  also , iq ^ 2 ? 
  really ? 
  what 's that even supposed to mean ? 
  [ kassel , germany ] ( http://cdn4.spiegel.de/images/image-38807-galleryv9-ipeh.jpg ) the tree is n't spectacular , but the giant christmas pyramid is cool, 
  the saying is about mozart , not beethoven . 
  a ) the monetary sum is based on the value of 100 ( ? ), 
  camels . 
  b ) in modern society there is no compensation that the victim could claim , just like there is no revenge or vigilantism . 
  the legal system decides as a non biased instance . 
  it might sentence the accused to pay a fine or to go to prison etc. , but the important part is that the `` victim '' plays no part the process . 
  the victim in this case is dead , but the victim 's family 's `` trial '' equals = pay x amount of money and we 're cool . 
  that 's sharia `` law '' . 
  is this the society you would want to live in ? 
  does n't matter if the accident is your fault or not , but if you can pay enough money you 're free . 
  humanity suffered through literally thousands of years under those conditions , until we reached the break trough of a neutral judicial system . 
  it 's vital to acknowledge the effort it took to accomplish this , in order to realize the importance of our current system and the values behind it . 
  it would be hilarious if the `` accused '' would actually pay those idiots in camels , the look on their faces would be priceless, 
  i 'm not in the mood to answer such a dumb question seriously , so i give the short version . 
  a lawsuit is based on : - civilized , modern law - a lack of camels , vigilantism and superstition - it does n't include threats, 
  if we trust on idiots and scum to defend our values all is lost already . 
  the vast majority of citizens stands somewhere between racists and tolerate-everything-dreamers , and those people have to find a solution, 
  the article is fine , but the content makes me question humanity . 
  it was a long way for our species to reach our current ( barely satisfying ) level of civilization ... then you have to read about people claiming camels as compensation and that 's happening in one of earth 's most advanced countries, 
  as if the ( edit : content of the ) article alone was n't bad enough, 
  turning whine into the blood of jesus ( very advanced magic ), 
  and klitschko would just turn into an even larger version of the hulk, 
  musicians . 
  his fucking parents had to get a real job , but he has it so much worse , that people with real jobs have to pay for him, 
  good , we can not allow some russians to cover up their crimes , the red army was n't better than the wehrmacht . 
  imagine what would happen if germany would try to censor any critique of our past . 
  we take responsibility for it and that should be the only way to deal with mistakes . 
  if you know how the humans called it back then you can pm me , and i guess that an entire field of science would like to share your knowledge too . 
  does this really belong in / r/europe ? 
  if you did this for african ancestors the entire map would be blue, 
  the dutch are the nicest people you can find, 
  germany has only left parties left . 
  the cdu is now as left as the social democrats were 20-30 years ago . 
  does the medicare include everything the health insurance covers in europe ? 
  i assume you like to assume on the internet ? 
  i 'm not really familiar with the american health care system ( and what i 've heard sounds quite bad to be honest ) , so can you maybe enlighten me with some more information ? 
  what exactly means `` for health there is medicare '' ? 
   all in all this means the median and the average american has more money to spend in retirement with common health care you do n't need any savings/money to receive medical care , it does n't matter if you 're the poorest person in the country or not , almost everything is covered , from psychotherapy to emergencies . 
  and btw : the rest of the western world is n't extremely leftist , but america is extremely right , it depends from which point you look at it, 
  how can the united states be considered as good as northern europe ? 
  maybe if you 're wealthy enough , but without a real health insurance you 're pretty much screwed if you 're 60 +, 
  looks like someone drank the ethanol, 
  we 've not always been the very best of neighbors to them and they 're still friendly to us, 
  bitburger should be renamed to bitboring , it tastes just bland, 
  [ beck 's ] ( http://ubermarkt.com/sites/default/files/becks_033_0.jpg ) tastes like shit , it 's like you stretched a bad pils with water and then added way too much carbonic acid, 
  they get mad and argue if they see a happy german [ empirical evidence ] ( http://blogs.hr-online.de/sportschau-em2012/files/2012/06/hummels_ap1.jpg ) also , [ lekkerbekje ] ( https://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1067&amp;bih=636&amp;q=lekkerbekje&amp;oq=lekkerbe&amp;gs_l=img.3.1.0l2j0i24j0i10i24j0i24l2j0i10i24j0i24l3.53.1244.0.2476.8.7.0.1.1.0.123.642.6j1.7.0....0...1ac.1.27.img..0.8.649.1mh4is1xcks ), 
  k\u00e4rnten and especially the faaker see, 
  as a turkish-german comedian put it : `` just say de auto and de haus '', 
  they are famous for one thing and that 's basically do n't give money to other countries .
