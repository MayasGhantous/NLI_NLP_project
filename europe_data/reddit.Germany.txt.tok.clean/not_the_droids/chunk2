  the completely ignore the reality behind the bailouts and that we 're helping other countries to save our banks . 
  --  populism, 
  they share our love for quality and punctuality, 
  populism works ( sadly ), 
  even though i would wish there could be democracy , equality , freedom etc. 
  for everyone , i 'm not so delusional to think that a military intervention would help anyone . 
  afghanistan and so many other examples showed that it does n't work . 
  unless they 're starting a second holocaust we simply should ' t do anything besides diplomatic sanctions . 
  a large part of the world is still so far behind modern values and culture that it makes no sense trying to force it upon them . 
  europe needed centuries of war and suffering to develop our current values . 
  with better education , the internet and ( hopefully good ) western influence the rest of the world wo n't need as long , but i say it again , forcing the issue does n't do anything besides creating extremists and even more suffering for the affected countries , while the interfering nations accumulate more and more debt , meanwhile the usa become '' addicted '' to war , because their military industrial complex demands it . 
  we 're experiencing a lack of serious problems right now , at least compared to most other countries, 
  for the love of god : please do n't start heitz with his `` dragon books '' , they 're pretty terrible . 
  i recommend his [ `` dwarves '' series ] ( http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_16?url=search-alias%3daps&amp;field-keywords=markus+heitz+dwarves&amp;sprefix=markus+heitz+dwa%2caps%2c314&amp;rh=i%3aaps%2ck%3amarkus+heitz+dwarves ) and , if you can find them in english , his books about the `` beast of g\u00e9vaudan '' . 
  probably not , but let 's be honest , is there any other party that poses as a realistic alternative ? 
  there are parties like the pirates , which offer different positions on niche topics , but they 're a possible coalition partner at best . 
  let 's play a game : we vote for the person which gives us the most actual answers to the questions . 
  have you heard the [ swabians ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=0sd5nojxdrw#t=29 ) talk ? 
  who wins a war between the dutch and the austrian ? 
  answer : germany, 
  well , if you remember that homosexuals are a minority and a wedding takes usually more than 3 months to plan , it is n't all that surprising, 
  your . 
  shit . 
  together . italy, 
  it 's not a moment by definition , but the way we germans have dealt with our recent past makes me very proud . 
  i know it was n't perfect , but looking at the other `` bad '' countries in ww2 , it was an enormous act of responsibility . 
  even the generations that were born long after the war feel shame and responsibility for it . 
  i know i 'm padding my own back here , but i think it says a lot about a nation , if you look at the way they deal with their mistakes . 
  good news everyone : their comment section is worse than ours !, 
  especially liked the one saying that germany had no impact on european culture ... 
  why am i so surprised that he sounds like a normal person ? 
  it 's like watching darth vader take a walk in the park, 
  aka : caps lock german !, 
  germany best : when i think about the future i am not scared , ca n't imagine what young people in spain etc. 
  are going through worst : germans live to work , not work to live, 
  we should listen to them , it takes true genius to argue that american capitalism has any relation to religion , because after all `` love thy neighbor '' is what the american dream is all about . 
  godless , socialist europe is damned !, 
  at this point there is no way to tell what ms is thinking , their actions are not explainable , maybe their management works secretly for sony , who knows ? 
  ^ / s they 've reached a comic bad guy level of ridiculousness, 
  i 've just watched it and i 'm out of words ... 
  never let the germans finish a race / r/imgoingtohellforthis, 
  we 're actually powering our cars with southern european tears, 
   the germans are once again rewriting history from a russian ? 
  really ? 
  to be fair , he lost two elections in a row before that, 
  that is the lesson we 've learned from the war : hate people for something their ( great - ) grandparents did, 
  fish-napping ? 
  psa : do not sign avaaz petitions , they will spam you to death with their shitty campaigns if you really want to sign the petition use [ 10 minute mail ] ( http://10minutemail.com/10minutemail/index.html ) or similar services . 
  are you serious ? 
  are you really implying that post war germany had better conditions than greece now ? 
  ask the usaf or raf if they 'll drop a bomb or two on athens , rebuilding a destroyed city is a good way to create jobs . 
  do you realize that you sound like a child , unwilling to be responsible for your own actions ? 
  your claims sound as stupid as the `` bild '' headlines about lazy greeks . 
  it 's so much easier to blame others , the only down side is that you make a fool of yourself . 
  `` we fucked up our country because nazi germany , derp derp '', 
  [ germany 1945 ] ( http://www.derweg.org/deutschland/geschichte/images/nachkriegszeit-2_big.jpg ) [ greece 2013 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/athens_montage_2.jpg ) questions ? 
  [ every german reading this thread ] ( http://www.hostingbytes.us/images/2/2724725.png ), 
  collecting data on vegetarians must be the easiest job in the world , they tell you about it if you look into their general direction, 
  i called the gestapo . 
  no one reveals our secret plans to the dirty peasants from / r/europe !, 
  you can get above 100mb/s in most german cities already , so this should only concern the rural communities, 
  damn it , you caught us !, 
  what would you say if hitler was reelected a couple of times after 1945 ? 
  nope , i 'm from hessen , closer to bavaria than hamburg, 
  relatively accurate , but what is it with the sauerkraut ? 
  it does n't play any role at all in our daily life , where do foreigners find that much sk in our country ? 
  always knew that hans gruber was austrian, 
  relax , it was sarcasm, 
  saying that israel uses the word `` anti-semitism '' as a way to shut critique down is blatant anti-semitism !, 
  you should be ashamed of yourself !, 
  i think it 's more about education , which goes hand in hand with wealth . 
  educated people tend to vote for the `` middle '' parties , idiots vote for left or right extremists , because they offer simple ideas for simple minds . 
  fritz was a common german name , it 's short for friedrich . 
  that 's probably the reason, 
  the german words are all very rude , and we usually avoid them netherlands - k\u00e4sek\u00f6ppe ( cheese heads ) france - froschfresser ( frog eater ) italy - spaghettis poland - polacken ( no translation possible ) uk - inselaffen ( island mokeys ), 
  the only difference is that candy is food , even if its not very healthy , but the same could be said about fast food . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  smoking on the other hand is just plain self destruction . 
  well , there are more then 3 different bills , so it 's not really a problem ... 
  instead of one person for each country it would be cool to have `` themed '' bills for all countries . 
  5 $ - music theme ( beethoven , mozart , bach , verdi , chopin , smetana , dvorak , grieg , strau\u00df , wagner ) 10 $ - science ( einstein , planck , curie , schroedinger , newton ) 20 $ - philosophy ( goethe , kant , nietzsche , voltaire ) you get the idea . 
  i think this would be way better than the stuff we have now, 
  3.6 billion years of evolution lead to this comment ... 
  besides the obvious austria and netherlands , i feel a connection to france . 
  we are like two different brothers , who had a fight and did n't talk for years , but now we 're back to talking and it 's awesome . 
  so poland invaded germany in a video game ? 
  i guess were officially even now, 
  damn it italy !, 
  get your shit together !, 
  koreans dominate in star craft , but if you look at the some of the most popular titles they are n't better than europe or china . 
  their dota 2 scene is actually far behind europe . 
  always reminds me of this [ beautiful picture ] ( https://angriestmanonline.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ericcantona66.jpg ), 
  the glorious thread army strikes again, 
  no , i 'm quite certain the 70 million dead are still the real tragedy . 
  the holy european empire !, 
  do n't give us all the credit , some of the other northern countries would 've preferred stricter conditions for the loans . 
  it became `` germany vs greece '' so that the nazi card could be played . 
  mozart was born in salzburg , which at the time belonged to bavaria . 
  [ sch\u00f6nau am k\u00f6nigssee ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=k%c3%b6nigssee+st.+bartholom%c3%a4&amp;biw=1198&amp;bih=697&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=q3bqvbwqmov3up20goai&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;dpr=0.9#tbm=isch&amp;q=k%c3%b6nigssee+sch%c3%b6nau ) is ridiculously idyllic . 
  do n't give 4chan any ideas ...
