that 's a typical issue for us germans . 
  we learn very formal english in school and learning regular , colloquial english can be really hard if you have no one to talk to in english . 
  to the people who did it - yes . 
  to a whole ethnic group - no . 
  i also thought there 'd be way less guns in europe , since for most people it 's basically illegal to own one in most countries . 
   edit : ** [ actual data from 2007 available here . 
  ] ( http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/a-yearbook/2007/en/small-arms-survey-2007-chapter-02-annexe-4-en.pdf ) ** over 270mln guns in usa and precise numbers for all eu countries . 
  huh , i would have thought there 'd be a * way * bigger gap between the us and european countries . 
  i mean , three times as many guns is still a lot but i thought it would be like ... ten times . 
  greece it is , then !, 
  i heard they have grown really fond of us germans since we 're helping them out with their financial troubles . 
  they seem to have somehow ... replicated on their way to croatia . 
  i love croatia and i 've spent most of my vacations there . 
  it 's an incredibly diverse and beautiful country . 
  unfortunately , that 's not exactly a secret anymore , especially among germans ( like me ) . 
  last year i was there and i was seriously wondering if anyone was still holding the fort in germany . 
  and sadly , it seems that the annoying `` ballermann '' tourists that are slowly driven out of mallorca all decided to come to croatia . 
  as much as i love the country , i 'm not sure if i 'm going to spend another vacation there in the next years . 
  maybe i 'll go to mallorca , now that the ballermann tourists are all in croatia . 
  i assign a separate email address for every website or service where i sign up . 
  this way , when i get spam , i can see which of my addresses got into the hands of the spammers and i can shut it down . 
  most of the time , it 's small online shops or other `` unprofessional '' websites , where my address gets lost . 
  i assume they do n't have the best security systems in place and they can easily be hacked for the addresses . 
  usually when i contact them , they seem surprised and often do n't really understand what i want from them . 
  namibia is awesome . 
  most of the country has a pretty high altitude , very low population density and is very dry . 
  it 's a great place that i would love to visit again .

  no i do n't . 
  tell me . 
  i 've been living in berlin for a while ( neuk\u00f6lln and wedding ) . 
  i 'd say that there are no neighbourhoods that i would generally consider unsafe . 
  some places are noticeably poorer than others and in some neighbourhoods , you can feel like an outsider if you 're german . 
  but that does n't translate to any kind of threat , you can walk around these areas any time of the day or night without being bothered . 
  sometimes i feel safer in neuk\u00f6lln because even at night , there are always people around and i know if something happened , i would n't be alone . 
  if a situation feels unsafe , trust your instincts . 
  bad things can happen in every part of berlin ( and the world ) . 
  this still holds true . 
  you can get mugged or raped anywhere in the world , but berlin is still one of the safest cities of its size . 
  there is absolutely no reason not to travel to berlin . 
  berlin is one of the safest cities ( of its size ) in the world . 
  i 've been living here ( wedding and neuk\u00f6lln ) for seven years and i have never felt unsafe . 
  my roommate is an attractive blonde in her late twenties who grew up in berlin . 
  she 's often coming home alone at 2 am with no worries whatsoever and nothing has ever happened . 
  the situation has n't changed in the last weeks either . 
  i 've spent new years in wedding and besides the absolutely insane use of fireworks , there was nothing dangerous . 
  i walked home most of the way that night and had no scary encounters . 
  i 've been outside quite a lot during the last days and seriously , berlin is exactly the same way it has been for the past seven years that i 've lived here . 
  the most dangerous thing right now is the weather , it 's fucking freezing and there was some snow today so the streets and sidewalks are really slippery . 
  what happened in cologne and some other cities is significant and definitely warrants our attention . 
  but we should n't forget that as dramatic as these incidents were , only a tiny part of the population was affected . 
  this has no relevance to the general safety in germany . 
  i do n't know why so many people put all their hearts into painting these doomsday scenarios . 
  there is no unsafe place in germany . 
  you do n't know what unsafe places look like . 
  at least in germany , it is now . 
  i do n't know why there was such a delay .

  do you know the difference between muslims and islamists ? 
   dutch is pretty much the bastard child of german and english ... and trying to clear your throat while speaking . 
  `` alright , the data was stolen this time but it 's fine because we fired some guy for that . 
  and we paid a few million euros to a company and they say it 's totally safe now . 
  so people really should stop making such a big deal out of this . '',

   the problem with batteries in cars is that they take a long time to charge , and do n't last that long . 
  i wonder why they do n't just remove the battery at a petrol station and stick a nice new fully charged one in your car and put your old one on charge , to be used by the next person . 
  [ tesla has demonstrated this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5v0vl3nnhy ) , but apparently did n't pursue it any further . 
  i think ultimately , the idea is to charge your car in your own garage over night and the possibly also while you 're at work ( or shopping , or anything really ... ) . 
  you would only need a swappable battery for long trips , but fast charging seems to be the go-to solution there . 
   until now most germans i met that are annoyed by our `` dubbing culture '' had an arrogant , shortsighted , `` it 's 2016 , people that do n't understand english are all idiots '' mindset . 
  the idiots are the ones who work for international corporations , put down `` englisch : verhandlungssicher '' in their resume , watch every movie or tv show in the dubbed version and just ca n't figure out why they have trouble communicating with their international clients . 
  english movies and tv shows are such a great opportunity to learn the language in your spare time without breaking a leg or spending a fortune on private lessons , i just do n't get why so many smart and well educated people do n't use it . 
  even the good dubs are still dubs . 
  they have a limited choice of voice actors , limited budget , limited schedule and no instructions from the original director . 
  i 'm sure they 're doing the best they can , but to me it still sounds fake and cheap . 
  it really ruins a good movie .

  one more thing we can do right now is to install more flexible power plants like gas or hydro , that can quickly respond to changing demand and supply . 
  awesome !, 
  let 's do germany next !, 
  huh , i had no idea . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  fusion wo n't be here in time to solve the fossil fuels problem , but it may open up completely new possibilities if/when it 's finally ready . 
  germany is number two in the world regarding total installed pv power and number one per capita ( 2015 data , [ source ] ( http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/pics/iea-pvps_-__a_snapshot_of_global_pv_-_1992-2015_-_final_2_02.pdf ) ) . 
  it 's hard to imagine how you could possibly be more wrong . 
  fusion will come too late to solve our current energy problems . 
  by the time it 's ready , we will most likely be close to 100 % renewable energy from wind , solar , hydro and other sources . 
  but it may be able to make energy way cheaper in the distant future .
