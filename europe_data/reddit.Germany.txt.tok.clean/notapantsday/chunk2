  she basically said that gay marriage could be something for the parliament to vote on as a `` gewissensentscheidung '' , meaning the members would only follow their conscience instead of party politics . 
  it 's the last week of this legislative period , after that there will be a long summer break and the election of a new government . 
  83 % of germans support gay marriage and she was likely trying to make some concessions with the upcoming elections in mind . 
  however , a draft for a new law on gay marriage already existed and the other parties just said : `` great idea , let 's vote on this right now ! '' . 
  merkel could n't do much to stop this and all other parties had been in favor of gay marriage for a long time , so the result of the vote was pretty clear . 
  it has been compared to the incident where g\u00fcnter schabowski , then speaker of the gdr government , accidentally caused the end of the gdr by improvising an answer and slightly misrepresenting a passage of text that he had been handed just before . 
  that makes me so angry ... if you love erdogan so much , then why did you leave him ? 
  i would be so pissed off about the people who * do n't even live in my country * and still voted to turn it into a shithole ... 
   i once saw a solar panel powered parking pass issuing machine under a tree ... in germany . 
  they 're just solar powered so nobody has to lay a cable to that spot on the parking lot . 
   this and showers that are fixed on the wall . 
  how am i supposed to clean myself like that ? 
  my shower is the worst . 
  it has one head fixed to the wall and one hand shower . 
  great , right ? 
  but somehow , the person who built it decided that nobody really uses the hand shower , so it always defaults to the fixed shower head . 
  i have to pull the knob for the hand shower , then turn it on at full blast so it will stay on . 
  if i want to use less water , it automatically goes back to the fixed shower head , same when i turn it off completely . 
  why not just let me switch between the two shower heads and keep it that way ? 
  is it * actually * legal anywhere ? 
  we love to follow rules , not authority . 
  if angela merkel said that she jaywalked all the time and other people should do it too ( screw the law ) she would be lynched . 
  we also have `` feucht '' ( moist ) and `` feuchtwangen '' ( moist cheeks ) . 
  i think your passport looks like the little booklet that comes with first aid kits . 
  i think we 've also done a decent job of dealing with our past . 
  there are very few countries that build museums and memorials to remind everyone of the awful things * they * have done . 
  there 's still a lot of work to do , but nobody can accuse us of trying to cover up or whitewash our past , at least regarding the holocaust . 
  yeah , that was one of the more stupid decisions of my life . 
  i think latin was the most useless subject i had at school . 
  first english , then we had a choice between latin and french . 
  these were the mandatory languages . 
  after that , we could still pick italian at our school , although i think most schools in germany teach spanish instead of italian . 
  ** poland : ** i think a lot of the people are alright , but their politics lately are very worrying . 
  otherwise known for cheap and slightly dangerous fireworks . 
  ** czech republic : ** prague is supposed to be great for getting drunk in a beautiful city on a budget . 
  also , lots of us still call you `` tschechoslowakei '' ( czechoslovakia ) . 
  ** austria : ** beautiful mountains , beautiful cities . 
  populated by hillbillies that make delicious food . 
  ** switzerland : ** even more beautiful mountains , people call themselves `` eidgenossen '' and have a reputation for being slow . 
  we like your cheese and toblerone . 
  ** france : ** our best friends , even though they can be a little weird sometimes . 
  food ranges all the way from `` awesome '' to `` why would you eat that ? '' . 
  great for holidays , from the rough and windy bretagne to the sunny and warm cote d'azur . 
  ** luxembourg : ** lots of banks , cheap taxes and that 's pretty much all i know . 
  ** belgium : ** love your waffles , hate your roads . 
  ** netherlands : ** arch nemesis when it comes to soccer , otherwise good friends . 
  obsessed with camping ( just like us ! ) . 
  people are easier to understand than some other countries that claim to speak german . 
  ** denmark : ** i do n't know much about denmark . 
  '' \u00d6re '' is sometimes used , because it sounds similar to `` euro '' . 
  otherwise , we use `` tacken '' , `` taler '' or `` riesen '' ( for 1000 $ ) . 
  fun fact , `` taler '' are named that way because they were first produced in the city of [ joachimsthal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1chymov ) . 
  they were originally called `` joachimsthaler '' . 
  also , `` taler '' is the origin of the word `` dollar '' . 
  so the us dollar is named after a tiny town near the czech/german border . 
  `` polnisch '' or `` polen - '' is generally used for something done poorly . 
  for example , if you use a flashlight taped to your hood because your high-beams are broken , that would be a `` polen-fernlicht '' ( polish high-beams ) . 
  i love them too , but they 're not the same . 
  i think france and belgium are the only places in the world where you can get decent croissants . 
  i definitely never got one in germany . 
  ( `` do you have bags in front of the door ? '' ), 
  i think it dates back to when poor people would just hang up bags in the doorway to block the wind when they could n't afford a real door ( or had to use it as firewood ) . 
  we celebrate on july first instead , 
  we have a lot of jokes for names that sound foreign , but are actually german : machamal ahallabad = arabic swimming pool architect ( literally `` go and build a swimming pool '' ) lasse einstr\u00f8m = swedish minister of reproduction ( `` let them flow in '' ) wokaki imawashi = japanese hygiene minister ( `` where there 's shit , always wash '' ), 
  nah , i 'd rather just learn english instead . 
  or from the german `` keks '' . 
  favorite thing : the lake . 
  we have a promenade with caf\u00e9s right next to the water and it 's just so relaxing to sit there , have a drink and look over the water . 
  plus , i can go swimming whenever i want during the summer ( just 300m from my home to the beach ) . 
  least favorite thing : you ca n't go shopping on a saturday morning unshowered and with a stain on your shirt without meeting half a dozen people from work . 
  it 's just too small of a town . 
  it 's reasonably popular . 
  i know a few people who watch ice hockey , even though i do n't do it myself . 
  i 'd say most people know the local ice hockey team if it 's somewhat successful . 
  i 'm not into ice hockey at all , but i know that the team from berlin ( where i 've lived for six years ) is called `` eisb\u00e4ren '' . 
  i 'm sure that at least 3 out of 4 people in berlin know this , and the same is probably true for every city with a decent ice hockey team . 
  large trucks or suvs make a lot more sense in the us , but here in germany i just do n't get the appeal . 
  it 's pretty normal to do 180 kph/112 mph on the autobahn , but most suvs will need a lot of fuel for that , so i rarely see them going faster than 140 kph , apart from the occasional porsche cayenne . 
  i actually find it hard to come up with anything . 
  i like us culture in general . 
  do n't know if it really originated in the us , but i do n't understand people who feel the need to drive a huge suv in the inner city . 
  so much harder to find a parking space or get around tight corners . 
  i think streets in the us are actually wider and everything is more accommodating for huge cars/trucks , but here in germany it really seems stupid to me . 
  plus , once you 're out of the city and on the highway , the sheer size will again make you slower . 
  you pay a ton of money for a big car with a big engine , and you 'll be passed on the highway by me and my opel astra . 
  5.3 km by bike , 6-7 km by car . 
  both take me about 15 minutes . 
  which one i take depends mostly on the weather and how tired i am . 
  but to be honest , i mostly take the car . 
  your capital is lisbon and i think porto is another city ( although i might be misled by the name ) . 
  you speak portuguese , just like brazil , mozambique and angola ( i think ) . 
  you were once a great seafaring nation . 
  your atlantic coast is supposed to be very beautiful , but i 've never been there and ca n't recall any pictures . 
  i 'm imagining cliffs , little towns and villages , rough winds and beautiful sunsets . 
  as someone who works in a hospital ... german is absolutely crucial . 
  most patients are elderly and rarely speak decent english at all , let alone medical english . 
  saying hello and asking for the time is one thing , but describing what happened at your last hospital stay is something completely different . 
  and if a patient comes to a german hospital , they expect to be understood in german . 
  you will have a really hard time finding any patient who is willing to speak english at a german hospital , even if they 're perfectly capable . 
  our street once lost power when an excavator hit a cable .
