  that was the only time . 
  for berlin , i think one of the prettiest buildings is [ schloss charlottenburg ] ( https://www.residenzkonzerte.berlin/index.php?rex_img_type=cb_slideshow_large&amp;rex_img_file=schloss_slideshow.jpg ) . 
  the ugliest one i know is the [ m\u00e4usebunker ] ( http://68.media.tumblr.com/549cbc6b847220810914111f9354cbb0/tumblr_o0n1yl3gkq1qa84n5o1_1280.jpg ) , which is named that way because it 's a university building where they do experiments on mice ( definitely not on humans though ) . 
  we also have [ streuselkuchen ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bkd8gjt6z_c/vanr9njcw3i/aaaaaaaaceq/jm05oucbote/s1600/dsc00285.jpg ) in germany , which comes pretty close to your coffee cake and is more widely available . 
  but the dough is different , streuselbr\u00f6tchen have a yeast dough that is not quite as sweet as cake dough and also the crumbles are usually bigger . 
  in my hometown ( aachen ) , there was something called '' [ streuselbr\u00f6tchen ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/rezepte/130/130644/610930-960x720-streuselbroetchen.jpg ) '' , which is basically a sweet roll with crumbles on top . 
  they were one of the basics that you could find at literally every bakery , such as croissants or bread . 
  i was shocked when i moved to berlin and could n't find them anywhere . 
  i thought they had just run out at first , but when i asked for them nobody even knew what i meant . 
  aachen is very famous for other baked goods ( printen ) but somehow the streuselbr\u00f6tchen is never recognized as a regional specialty . 
  i 'm definitely not the only one who was surprised to find out that it did n't exist elsewhere . 
  we used to have that , but somehow it just disappeared 10-15 years ago . 
  recently , i had so much money in my wallet that it would n't fold anymore . 
  it did n't fit in my pocket unfolded and i did n't know where else to put the money . 
  there were lots of people around , so i was trying to be inconspicuous , but i failed miserably . 
  eventually , i just took a large wad of notes out of my wallet and stuffed it into my pocket , for everyone to see . 
  fortunately , i was n't robbed . 
  learn german , respect and follow our laws . 
  otherwise , i do n't think it 's any of my business how other people cook , what music they listen to or which god they worship . 
  the one thing that annoys me is when people have been living in germany for years , do n't speak a lick of german and do n't bring any translator to important appointments . 
  i 'm an anesthesiologist and i have to see people before they get anesthesia , in order to find out whether they have any pre-existing conditions that we have to know about and in order to explain what exactly is going to happen and what the risks and side effects are . 
  how do some people imagine the whole thing to go down if they speak pashto and a little bit of farsi but nothing else ? 
  some do n't seem embarrassed at all to have their 6 year old daughter translate for them because they never bothered to learn the language of the country they chose to live in . 
  meanwhile , their daughter learned to crawl , walk , eat , drink , poop , read , write , learned their native language and on top of that another language that her parents were unable to teach her . 
  how do you not feel like it 's time to learn the language yourself at that point ? 
  of course , if they 've just arrived as refugees , i can imagine there are more pressing issues than learning the language . 
  and still i 've had refugees who were here for just a few weeks but were very eager to learn german and showed off the words they already knew . 
  so if you 've been living here for years , there is really no excuse at all for not speaking german . 
   for germany it might be to drive 160 km/h on the middle lane on the highway . 
  oh , so that was you ... move over ffs !, 
  kitchen . 
  no space in my bathroom and i do n't have a basement or utility room . 
  but not / r/de . 
  only german in / r/de . 
  go to / r/germany for english . 
  in germany , everything is dubbed ( badly ) . 
  out of interest , how long ago was that ? 
  because we learned way less than that . 
  just a little bit as part of the biology class , such as changes during puberty and the basic anatomy . 
  but it was n't really dedicated sex ed , we learned about it the same way we learned that birds have a cloaca and that some insects go through metamorphosis . 
  no doctors/gynecologists to talk to and no expert from the outside . 
  we have lots of idiots ( also mrs. kepetry ) , but i do n't get the same vibe from them that i get from trump . 
  they show restraint in some situations and if you do n't understand what they 're saying , you might actually think that they 're normal politicians for a moment . 
  in the namib desert , i think it was about 50 \u00b0 c. 
  but it was a very dry heat and there was some wind , so it really did n't feel that bad to be honest . 
  we were even walking around and running up and down dunes . 
  just had to drink a lot . 
  i like this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7a6ak8qggy, 
  we have very big differences in germany . 
  most people speak a mild version of the regional dialect , but people who speak more pronounced dialects are often hard to understand , even for other germans . 
  here 's an example from my home region ( aachen ) : https://soundcloud.com/oecher-platt/der-unterschied-zwischen-mutter-und-vatertag-dr-ongerschead-tosche-modder-an-vadderdag-ocher-platt most germans will have trouble understanding every word of that , even though she 's speaking very slowly and clearly . 
  if you listen so some other dialects , such as [ bairisch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ma_7admxq ) , i think you can hear the difference even if you do n't speak german . 
  another great example is this weather forecast done in different dialects by the same guy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7a6ak8qggy, 
   with that being said , banning their subreddit is only adding gallons of fuel to their persecution complex fire . 
  so what ? 
  it wo n't change anything . 
  they will still be hateful and completely living in a world of their own . 
   they will simply regroup in a new location , but this time without visible opposition . 
  they did n't face a lot of opposition within their subreddit . 
  and even if they did , i doubt it would have changed any of their views . 
  i think we should really draw a clear line and not allow groups like these to spread their hatred in mainstream media . 
  let them have their little echo chamber on voat , because we ca n't really prevent that . 
  but they should n't have a place here . 
  but then no country really has free speech . 
  in the us , you can still be punished for defamation . 
  at least in germany , there definitely is a limit : from the english version of the grundgesetz :   ( 1 ) every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech , writing and pictures , and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources . 
  freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed . 
  there shall be no censorship . 
    ** ( 2 ) these rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws , in provisions for the protection of young persons , and in the right to personal honour . 
  ** so free speech is only granted as long as you do n't break any laws ( such as denying the holocaust ) or violate someone 's personal honor ( such as insulting and discriminating against people ) . 
  i have seen a raccoon and a beaver , both in berlin . 
  my impression is that the us is a deeply divided country . 
  here in germany , we also have different parties and different opinions . 
  but the two largest parties , who represent the typical left wing / right wing choice , actually share a lot of common policies and right now they 're even governing germany together . 
  i ca n't imagine republicans and democrats forming a coalition to shape the future of their country together . 
  we seem to have something like a moderate majority and then a few outliers , while the us has two major camps that are completely different sets of people . 
  so yes , i ( and i think most other germans ) are aware that a lot of people hate trump . 
  but we 're also aware that half of you voted for him and that he has a lot of support . 
  that is one thing that 's hard for us to grasp , because there 's a part of american culture that we do n't really get . 
  he already said that he 's not wearing socks ? 
  for someone out there , this will be the best thing that happened in 2016 . 
   it would be the worst thing greenland could do , but if the greenlanders voted democratically in a referemdum , then i would n't oppose it . 
  that sounds familiar ... 
  i always use the tri , but i ca n't see any difference to the trika ( other than the color ) . 
  but for drywall , tox acrobat are a bit stronger . 
  yup . 
  when they are built , pretty much all houses have masonry walls on the inside . 
  drywall is mostly used for later changes , for example turning one big room into two smaller ones . 
  it 's really funny how unfamiliar you americans are with these , just because your houses are built differently . 
  they are so ubiquitous in germany . 
  on the other hand , most germans have no idea how to properly screw something to drywall . 
  they often end up plugging these plastic screw anchors into the drywall , which regularly ends in disaster . 
  i have a colleague from moldova who always says he 's from romania because he 's tired of always explaining what and where moldova is . 
  it 's * romania 's * poor cousin and i bet at least a third of europeans have n't even heard of it . 
  i think in germany , there 's definitely a trend of rich people moving to town houses in the city centers instead of the suburbs . 
  i 've seen a lot of these being built when i was living in berlin . 
  it 's [ not quite as pleasant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0vhncm294e ) during the winter , though . 
  the [ thousands of little islands ] ( https://adria24-new.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/phxkb8ak_np-brijuni-kroatien-reisefuhrer.jpg ) , the [ velebit mountains ] ( http://www.holiday-home.de/fileadmin/images/laender/kroatien/kroatien-kvarner-bucht-paklenica-riviera-hafen-stadt-panorama-meer-berge.jpg ) at the coast , the beautiful [ old towns ] ( https://de.aegeanair.com/-/media/destinations/dubrovnik/dubrovnik_final_cover.jpg ) , the national parks such as [ plitvice lakes ] ( http://hercex.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/plitvice___.jpg ) or [ krka ] ( https://www.goolets.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/krka-national-park1.jpg ) ... add that to the great food and underwater landscape . 
  the only downside is that it 's really no secret anymore and it 's become unbearably touristy in a lot of places . 
  we used to have them , maybe 10-15 years ago .
