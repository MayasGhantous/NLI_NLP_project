  i 'm actually capable of forming my own opinion , and not swollowing the mainstream bs . 
  the moral authority comes from ukraine 's actions taken in 1994 . 
   di-did you read my last post ? 
  i said i was in favour of russia having crimea , this is the reason why i am in favour of it . 
  it is part of their regional security . 
  yes i did . 
  just thought i 'd state that this is the actual reason to occupy crimea and not the morality . 
   that was never on the table but automatically assumed by the kremlin . 
  military cooperation was part of the association contract with the eu , and ukraine was about to quit their contract with russia regarding their naval base . 
   this is bullshit . 
  crimea is the only majority pro-russian place in ukraine . 
  donbass region is ~ 40 % in favour . 
  not a majority and therefore i am opposed to russia 's invasion of eastern ukraine . 
  except that ukrainian government did n't even care to carry out a referendum and proceed to kill the protesting civilians by declaring them terrorists and sending their nazi troops . 
  you might call the ukrainian civillian people fighting for their right `` russia 's invasion '' as much as you want . 
  do some research and see for yourself . 
  all the western propaganda aside ( as to who was where , and who had kidnapped and beaten whom ) . 
  it 's a fact that 1994 the referendum took place with the known outcome . 
  namely , crimea wanting to join russia . 
  also a fact that there were no russian soldiers protecting ( or however you 'd like to call it ) the crimean civilian population . 
  so , the ukrainian government did n't recognize the referendum and went ahead to ** forcefully ** ( as in ukrainian army ) make sure that crimea stays in ukraine . 
  this time , though , russia had not only the moral authority ( which is bs anyway ) , but also a very strong interest in keeping their naval base -- as opposed to letting it be run by nato/us . 
  so they occupied crimea . 
  which is ** totally ok ** . 
  compare crimea to donzek , donbass , luhansk , debaltseve , or kramatorsk ; where civilian people wanted the same as the crimean , but this time without any protection from bad ivan . 
  how many died in those regions ? 
  and now , you go on to claim it was not ok to protect the people in crimea , and their naval base ? 
  except 1994 they ( as in crimean ) already had a referendum with the exact same outcome . 
  / edit : disambiguation as to whom had the referendum back then, 
  so i watched it . 
  kinda okay-ish , some scenes were kinda ridiculous though . 
  it leads me to believe you 're a troll . 
  it 's not a secret that there is a petrodollar system at work . 
  and it 's also not a secret ** how ** it works . 
  just as bretton woods system before it creates the ** demand ** for usd ( i 'm curious if you 'll be able to figure out why that is ) . 
  but , as opposed to bretton woods , it 's without ** limits ** . 
  let 's see if you 'll be able to figure out the rest all by yourself . 
  gosh , now everyone knows !, 
  i see you still do n't grasp basic concepts of logic . 
  why do n't you just go ahead and search for an explanation for the following : * what is a premise * does an ** explanation ** of an existing system need a premise * is the conclusion , based on the former explanation , a premise of this explanation then , go ask someone who 's more knowledgable in economics than you . 
  you might want to start with / r/economics and ask there . 
  furthermore stop pretending something is conspiracy if the only reason for that is that it does n't reflect your opinion . 
  you 've been shown the explanation of the mechanics of petrodollar . 
  you either did n't bother reading it , or you simply did n't understand it . 
  you might want to go and educate yourself on the petrodollar . 
  it might get old , but the age does n't change it 's validity . 
   also , you just suggested the us military only gets involved so hollywood has material . 
  you answer to my post where i point out why the us does what it does , and it 's obviously not for hollywood . 
  so why even try and bs me with your nonsense again ? 
  well , poorly phrased on my side . 
  my appologies . 
  you 're right , of course . 
  italy and greece , both just being rational and against further sanctions against russia . 
  which union do you mean ? 
  euro or the eu ? 
  italy and greece being also pro russia, 
   username . 
  oh that ... actually the username has more to do with mortal kombat , than with the nsa   also , grow up . 
  that 's your whole argument ? 
  perhaps you 'd like to provide me with some more substantial arguments as to why i 'm wrong ? 
  what is it in particular that you disagree with ? 
  that the us is the cancer causing death of hunderds of thousands ** directly ** , and that of ** millions ** implicitly only to keep their economy afloat ? 
  no , i want the us to collapse because it causes nothing but death all across the world , only to produce some other hollywood bs that pictures the poor us troups being in a mental disorder from killing ... 
  pathetic . 
  where did i mention the nsa ? 
  it 'll be a happy day for me to see petrodollar collapse and the us being able to afford only as much as they actually ** can ** pay for . 
  was about to write how i 'd love to see that happen ... then i realised there are already a dozen of such posts . 
  awesome !, 
  what does the regular russian soldier has , [ this ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-12 ) one ? 
  how does it change what actually happens in ukraine and what the ukrainian people say ? 
  again , if you do n't trust this one , search for other videos , there 's a ton of them . 
  you did n't find any video that contains testimony/interview of civilian people in the regions ? 
  alright then . 
  so , how difficult is it to find stuff like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox7zjog2ify&amp;oref=https%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dox7zjog2ify&amp;has_verified=1 ) ( nsfw ), 
  i did n't want to link to particular videos , as i want that the people do their own research , and decide for themselves as to what is credible and what not . 
  the videos show that ukrainian people are shot by the ukrainian army , and the west supports the murder of this civilian people !, 
  who 's talking about comments ? 
  videos of testimonies/interviews of civilians in the aforementioned regions . 
  go on youtube , search for testimonies of civilians of donezk , lugansk , uglegorsk , crimea , or debaltseve . 
  i 'm aware of that . 
  of course the invasion of a country is justified as long as they do n't fullfill your tightly phrased criteria . 
  fuck the people of the country and what they think , we know better what 's good for them . 
  you mean , the invasion of iraq in 2003 by us was a direct answer to the invasion of kuwait in 1990 by iraq ? 
  i really do n't think so . 
  do n't you remember ? 
  the invasion by the `` coalition of the willing '' of iraq was due to the `` wmd `` s 'n stuff !, 
  gosh !, 
  you only make it worse , seriously . 
  just stop posting if you do n't want to embarrass yourself even more . 
  and `` invading '' is a subset of `` whatever is necessary '' . 
  so what ? 
  and kgb _ * certainly knows what the purpose the law has . 
  so why explain it ? 
  does your explanation make the law any less `` fuck the world in the face we do what we want '' ? 
  that 's some blatant bullshit right there !, 
  please go inform yourself before spitting out even more nonsense . 
  well , someone 's pissed and it indeed looks to be an ad hominem hate . 
  people do n't always act rational , 
  i do n't see the lack of possibility to have multiple citizenships as a problem . 
  there are however `` h\u00e4rtef\u00e4lle '' where you can keep your turkish / < what have you  citizenship .
