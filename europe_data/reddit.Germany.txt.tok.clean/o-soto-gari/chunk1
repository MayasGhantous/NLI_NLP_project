what was your favorite part of the trip ? 
  favorite city or town ? 
  best nature ? 
  best restaurant/bar ? 
  is brno nice ? 
  ok but there 's shredded uggos too . 
  like like in the dumps of india or nigeria is pretty harsh , but that does n't automatically make the people beautiful, 
  pretty popular , but unlike north america there 's zero hype about it . 
  no `` omg i * got ta * have my sriracha '' which thank god for that . 
  also most germans and german restaurants call it `` flying goose '' sauce because that 's the most popular brand , or just `` hot sauce '', 
  m\u00f6mbris-mensenges\u00e4\u00df ( gibberish-cafeteriabuttocks ), 
  i think it was some island in the indian ocean . 
  they lived in close proximity to nature , hunting their own food etc , while still looking modern . 
  damn i just saw a documentary the other day and they showed some island nation in the pacific or indian ocean and every.single.one.of.those people looked absolutely flawless . 
  objectively . 
  like an island of half gods or something . 
  i wish i could find it to look up the place, 
  [ grenada 's ] ( https://www.passportindex.org/?country=gd ) looks aesthetic af . 
  classy gold on navy blue , coat of arms is just the perfect size , not too crowded not too empty , clean font without being boring , not translated into a million different scripts and languages . 
  haha i knew of him but never watched an entire video but this is too funny . 
  `` the inner hollowed out world . 
  in the antarctic . 
  many civilizations live there . 
  some of them monarchies . 
  among them a few million reich-germans , as we all know . '', 
  in a hole underneath the antarctic . 
  millions of reich-germans . 
  lmfao and all of his listeners nod and agree , but not over enthusiastically , but as if it was the most obvious thing ever . 
  like i would agree with someone telling me that dogs bark , and cats meow . 
  and reich-germans live in a hollow in antarctica . 
  or `` ja , eh . '', 
  ( long `` e '' sound , not `` ey '' . 
  something like ja , * so * wieso or ja , klar . ), 
  we use it in germany too , though not as often . 
  project reality , arma , rising storm 2 , red orchestra , metro , stalker , p.t. , outlast , wargame red dragon , hotline miami, 
  komma her !, 
  how different are those dialects ? 
  can you write something in polessian and standard belarusian for comparison ? 
  ( i speak russian if that helps so i hope i can somewhat gauge the difference ), 
  how about your own country of belarus , op ? 
  english and german : dutch , very little swedish russian : ukrainian , serbian , some polish french : written spanish kazakh : nogai , kyrgyz , very basic tatar and turkish and a few others, 
  one of my favorite judo techniques, 
  doctors too at least in the or . 
  everyone wears them . 
  they 're easy to clean and keep sterile . 
  once you 've had your first patient puke/bleed/other all over your $ 100 sneakers you stop giving a fuck and bow to the croc overlords, 
  have n't been to any of them but i have friends/know people from all three . 
  azerbaijanis have the gayest accent ever ( no offense ) :d they 're definitely the most cheerful out of the three and the easiest to become friends with ( in my experience ) . 
  i like their cuisine the best . 
  armenians are the most serious out of the three . 
  chess is a big deal in armenia which is pretty cool . 
  it is ( was ? ), 
  a mandatory school subject like pe . 
  georgians sing all.the.time . 
  like you 'll walk down the street with them and they 'll start singing . 
  about anything . 
  you 're standing in line at the store with them - they 'll start singing . 
  not to have an audience or anything . 
  just because that 's what they do . 
  music is as big a part of them as i 've never seen with anyone before . 
  as far as politics goes georgia gets along with everyone - armenia and azerbaijan do n't . 
  berlin dialect / = standard german ( which is also the official language of austria ) . 
  no regulations . 
  and it 's not even close . 
  amazing . 
  also eibsee [ img1 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/57/f0/66/57f066102ffc0f1e502b32aee4ca24ef.jpg ) and [ img2 ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/fc/41/ed/eibsee-am-fusse-der-zugspitze.jpg ), 
  what 's a google ? 
  what 's a wikipedia ? 
  https://www.google.com/search?q=bosnian+serb https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbs_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina, 
  why ? 
  neuilly or rueil are in the banlieue - and have less maghrebins than paris quartiers like barb\u00e8s or la goutte d'or for example . 
  `` banlieue '' simply means something like `` suburbs '' . 
  there 's extremely affluent ones as well as shitty ones . 
  german cauldron : does n't need a guard . 
  all the people inside are technically experts on how to get out , and all of them have degrees in getting out of cauldrons , but nobody is actually getting their hands dirty and * actually * getting out . 
  they 're all just brainstorming and scheming and planning 24/7 - and waiting for someone from poland to hire to get them out . 
  basically for every academical profession there is a vocational equivalent - more hands-on , less scientifc . 
  for doctors it 's nurses ( vocational job in germany ) , lawyers - lawyer 's assistant , chemist - lab assistant . 
  you can study computer science at university or do vocational training in the same field . 
  similarly , you can study engineering or mechatronics or electronics at university but you can get vocational training for all of those as well . 
  as an academic you 'll probably end up creating things , or researching stuff , as someone with vocational training you 'll end up with a more menial job . 
  there is no `` stigma '' . 
  people who hold a higher degree are perceived as smarter/more hard working . 
  a professor is seen as superior to someone with a bachelor 's degree and a person with a bachelor 's degree is seen as superior to someone with vocational training . 
  which , are you going to argue that that 's somehow not true or not fair ( on average ) ? 
  haha damn hoisted by my own petard, 
  haha :d i love how out of all of those you find pork to be the most disgusting . 
  also , i said i eat beef `` 4-5 times a year '' . 
  this does n't automatically translate to me eating more pork . 
  i just do n't eat a lot of meat in general . 
  maybe once a month , if that . 
  beef does n't contain anything essential that ca n't be found in other types of meat , does it ? 
  there 's lamb/mutton , pork , dog , cat , horse , human , poultry , monkey , goat etc. 
  i eat those too sometimes . 
  4-5 times a year, 
  okay so our israeli guests had just finished their mandatory military service and were doing a euro trip , with no set timeline so they were planned to stay for two nights but we got along great so they stayed two more . 
  it was summer and the weather was just perfect and so whenever they were n't venturing about the city on their own i took them with me to the park or river or lake to drink beer , play frisbee and barbecue with my friends and then later they would go party somewhere ( our tastes in music and setting/location varied widely so we only went together once ) . 
  the thing they kept being amazed at was how lush and green germany was compared to israel and how little security and police there was everywhere . 
  i showed them around my university and some public buildings and they were bewildered by the fact that anyone can just walk in and out just like that . 
  they taught us some hebrew and we taught them german in return .
