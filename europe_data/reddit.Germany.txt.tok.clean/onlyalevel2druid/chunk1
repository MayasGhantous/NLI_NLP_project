there 's 1 woman in my neighborhood who always wears niqab ( complete with black gloves so her hands are n't even visible ) . 
  i know it 's just one woman because she always has a male family member as an `` escort , '' almost always her ( western dressed ) son . 
  syrians do n't wear burqa or niqab . 
  the refugee women i work with wear hijab mostly , if anything at all . 
  i 've seen burqas and abaya/niqabs with some regularity here ( nrw ) . 
  and if they die , we can eat them . 
  it 's win/win really, 
  fyi that 's actually not what the gr\u00fcner punkt signifies . 
  [ it indicates that the company who made the packaging offsets the costs of recycling it again themselves . 
  alternatively : if everywhere you go smells like shit , check under your own shoe . 
   refugees  `` illegal '' immigrants found your problem . 
  that 's not even all of them , one i noticed missing is the bundesamt f\u00fcr migration und fl\u00fcchtlinge . 
  this ... is n't true . 
  we do get asked why we were here and what we are doing ( and i have permanent residency status in de with an american passport ) . 
  a friend of mine ( also us citizen in de ) had a sort of mental breakdown and let his spousal visa expire and was arrested at german zollamt on his attempt to leave back to california . 
  they absolutely do not fuck around . 
  ( anger in the gut ? 
  let it out ! ), 
  was also a slogan of the afd ( right populist party whose logo is also found on that float in the form of a pin ) . 
  i am neither european nor a man , does that help ? 
  but it upset european men and is therefore bad !, 
  because when brown men tell women to wear it , it 's bad . 
  when white european men tell them not to wear it , it 's morally superior . 
  but the lebenspartnerschaft does n't offer the same rights as a marriage , making it `` lesser '' anyway . 
  yeah that comment made me worried i had missed something major on biden ... 
  i. . . uh , would n't call the one on ours the reichsadler . 
  it 's a bundesadler now . 
  yeah i saw `` genie\u00dferscheiben '' ( connoisseur slices ) at the grocery store yesterday on a packaging of vegan cheese . 
  nope , naturalization . 
  no it does n't . 
  there 's tons of exceptions to that `` rule '' in german citizenship law . 
  i naturalized to be german while keeping my us citizenship . 
  this is not entirely true . 
  source : am dual citizen us/de, 
  as a texan living in de , this comparison is very accurate . 
  yeah this area of texas actually has its own ( dying ) dialect of german known as [ texas german ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/texas_german ) . 
  for americans , 100 years is a long time . 
  for europeans , 100 miles is a long way . 
  i think you 're just really unfamiliar with our constitution . 
  wwii did a lot to make sure that germany today does n't allow for public displays of violent racism or similar . 
  lots . 
  there 's limits to freedom of speech basically always . 
  in germany , it 's illegal to say things that incite others to hatred of a race ; it 's codified into the constitution . 
  actions and words that endanger or go directly against the constitution are also illegal . 
  he described himself as `` black '' on his census entry . 
  this video is incredibly moving . 
  my deepest condolences to the dutch people . 
  then flair up !, 
  i 'm not sure people outside of russia interpret that sentiment as `` jealousy . '', 
  except that places like texas retained their own german dialect into today ... 
  our 1 $ stores sell fireworks basically year round ... 
  because federal minimum wage for tipped employees in the us is a whopping $ 2.12 / hr , perhaps ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ouaxhbk.jpg ) a ballot from the 2009 european parliament election from germany . 
  you base your entire concept of gender on who has testicles ? 
  yes , it 's a man in drag . 
  jokes on you , my american accent sounds french in german !, 
  ^ somehow, 
  there 's no explicit continuous tense in german . 
  `` i 'm walking '' is the same as `` i walk . '', 
  as a native english speaker , i have to say eichh\u00f6rnchen is n't much easier, 
   apples have been bread, 
  24 , germany , exact same scenario . 
  also that houses near our preferred locale start at a cool 1 million $ ... 
  just because he 's american does n't make him wrong . 
  until last year you could n't have an intercity bus system in germany unless it was servicing routes that had poor to no train service . 
  this effectively meant no intercity busses here . 
  it depends how much you work . 
  these jobs are 400 $ flat but receive 0 benefits ( no health insurance , even ) and are very very abusable by employers . 
  they are currently debating a minimum wage . 
  whole-heartedly agreed . 
  boring narrative , annoying characters . 
  why does anyone watch it ? 
  when you work in germany and there is no minimum wage ? 
  you can be paid as low as 400 $ / month here for a job . 
  the monthly ticket is 90 $ . 
  it 's not reasonable at all and i think they 're talking of more price hikes . 
  2,70 $ for a one-way in cologne . 
  count yourselves lucky !, 
  nah it 's ok , most germans i know have n't even met a jew ever anyway . 
  jew married to an atheist . 
  we went to church with spouse 's ( extremely christian ) family , have a tree , and exchanged gifts . 
  hard to turn down a mandatory day off work !, 
  whoa , someone with the same flair as me !, 
  i 'm gon na need a source for their sources because [ bildblog ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/ ) leads me to believe that no , they 're really not much better than the rudi dutschke days . 
   mass-circulation daily bild reported ugh . 
  because there are `` bigger things to worry about '' than the way women are portrayed in the media does n't mean you should n't worry about it . 
  it may surprise you to know that humans are highly intelligent and can focus on more than 1 topic at a time . 
  testosterone controls the sex drive of humans in general ... 
  european ( legal ) immigrant reporting in . 
  welfare is next to impossible to obtain . 
  or just pay in bills and round like everyone else . 
  give me a 20 $ , tell me you want 5 $ back . 
  like how everyone does it . 
  uh , as a european waitress/barmaid , no one fucking gives us 5 $ notes on top of their bill . 
  i 'm lucky if i swing 1 $ off some people . 
  plenty pay in exact change . 
  of course but you can not expect to punish toddlers for the sins of their parents . 
  that 's insanity . 
  this is a claim easily put to polish people , who also have the stereotype of stealing anything that is n't bolted down . 
  but where do the `` children as young as 2 '' fit into the `` only criminals who happen to be roma '' claim ?
