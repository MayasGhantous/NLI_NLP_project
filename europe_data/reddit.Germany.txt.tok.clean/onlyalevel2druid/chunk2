  this is incorrect . 
  we 're working on banning them ... perhaps 2nd ( 3rd ? ), 
  try is the charm . 
  lots from germany already , but i could add one more . 
  pm me !, 
  i imagine that with such overcrowding due to money issues , crime is the obvious choice for people with no other options . 
  i 've noticed a marked difference in road quality between east and west germany still ... 
  the first country the nazis conquered was germany . 
  that 's really interesting . 
  thanks , 
  i 've read the words for `` red '' differ in emotional weight , that one covers things like `` heart '' but the other is for the less poetic . 
  can a hungarian verify/dismiss this ? 
  i 've been curious !, 
  huh . 
  i 've never seen that error . 
  i 've only ever seen suomi , and even wiki lists it as such . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  not the email itself but all of the collected and stored metadata from email ? 
  fuck yeah i do . 
  oh no , i appreciated the in-depth comment . 
  i am also a transplanted american despite flair . 
  i 'm always curious others ' reasons for immigration , so thanks for the detailed look into your life . 
  take care !, 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what drew you to live in hungary specifically ? 
  i dunno , i 've never heard that , but it is kind of funny as far as stereotypes go . 
   safer and successful on average [ citation needed ] ( that does n't include just straight crime rates from countries as social problems , as / u/curtholiday said , tend to be a bigger factor there . 
  this hurts me . 
  language changes and to stand in its way or try to stop it would signal a death knell for it . 
  beginning sentences with `` so '' is not new within the last decade , even beowulf begins with `` so . '', 
  thanks for summing this up so succinctly . 
  as a white-appearing immigrant to germany , i thank genetics every day i do n't `` look '' muslim/turkish nor have an associated name . 
  older , burly guys say `` tsch\u00f6 '' here in nrw . 
  i 'd definitely say `` sch\u00f6nen tag noch '' over `` guten tag , '' for a pleasant end of the conversation . 
  i 'd use `` guten tag '' as like `` good ** day ** to you sir ! , '' kind of forcefully ending an unpleasant conversation . 
  i 'm guessing he means this : [ telegraph article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/8110114/us-embassy-accused-of-spying-in-norway.html ) [ cnn article ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2010/world/europe/11/04/norway.us.spying.probe/index.html ), 
  no , none use `` road rage '' but i 'm finding plenty that give the motive as '' \u00c4rger und frust im stra\u00dfenverkehr , '' `` anger and frustration in traffic . '', 
  did they forget to give you back your sense of humor when you left ? 
  i think you 're reading too much into it . 
  the way the answer is worded is to seem more diplomatic and less demanding of the customer , i think . 
  the overall message is `` do n't bother '' [ with `` because it wo n't work '' being implied ] . 
  i want a framed needlepoint of this on my wall . 
  it 's easiest to study it as 1 unit of vocabulary . 
  do n't learn `` hund , '' learn `` der hund . '', 
  do n't ever separate them in your mind and you 'll remember it better later . 
  as a foreigner who has only ever lived in the ` pott or k\u00f6ln , i feel that pain . 
  i 'm pretty certain i sound hysterical . 
  ( many is used for countable nouns , like in this case words . 
  much is used for things not-countable , like too much water sitting in passau  ), 
  they 're much , much better quality . 
  i 'm assuming you 're being sarcastic , in which case you should probably end your post with something like / s so people do n't mistake you for serious , 
   bureaucratic hug i like this phrase a lot !, 
  and which government is suppressing any speech in here ? 
  this is the internet , you do not have carte blanch free speech because you are at the whim of tos and moderation . 
  it 's still a big deal and was recently put in the spotlight in europe after a woman miscarrying died in a hospital as doctors looked on , unable to perform a life-saving abortion ( cause of death was blood poisoning ) .

  they have n't questioned him as he can not speak ( severe damage to the throat ) . 
  interrogation is when your miranda rights come into play . 
   and americans used to salute their flags in the same way that we 'd recognise as a nazi salute today . 
  you 're talking about the [ bellamy salute ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bellamy_salute ) . 
  it was not a `` nazi salute , '' and was actually changed from that to the hand over the heart * because * of the nazis in 1942 . 
  learn something about it before you play directly into godwin 's law , would you ? 
  there 's also / r/schland, 
  definitely not a lit major , and enjoyed the hell out of both the illiad and the odyssey . 
  perhaps you had poor instruction or need to read it/them again . 
  it 's pretty impressive , right ? 
  he evidently sews some of the suits himself , even !, 
  i guess the biggest one is that the former president is being indicted for corruption/abuse of power . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/national/20130412-49095.html ) also the bank of austria was ordered to pay 254 mil $ over a bank transfer that happened around the fall of the wall . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/money/20130412-49089.html ) cuter `` news , '' a tumblr ( `` what ali wore '' ) of an older gentleman 's collection of outfits in neuk\u00f6lln , berlin went viral . 
  it 's quite charming .

  well i know what i 'm doing this weekend . 
  goyim is plural . 
  tin foil hat better !, 
  do they really ? 
  my father-in-law speaks plattdeutsch ( as well as hochdeutsch of course ) and such , but i 've always gotten a vibe that low german was somehow `` lesser '' than hochdeutsch . 
  do n't worry mate , it was soviet , 
  remember the controlled detonation last year in munich ? 
  it was pretty rad to see video of !, 
  agh of course i fucked the title up . 
  near * !, 
  oh they were lovely at first !, 
  over skype and email they were really friendly and warm . 
  they were even really sweet the first week or so . 
  then when i started to settle in it went to shit . 
  judging by the way they talked about past au pairs ( insinuated heavily that the russian girl had stolen from them not because things were missing but because of her nationality ) should have been a red flag . 
  always ask to speak to prior employees !, 
  if they 're even slightly hesitant , be wary . 
  also know that there 's just no good way to tell . 
  they also had a cleaning lady who came once a week so that does n't really matter much . 
  yes you will have to get a new phone plan unless you 're sitting on several million euros in cash  just get a prepaid sim card for your phone and it 's really quite cheap . 
  the family that i worked for was outrageous . 
  they would chastise me for the `` amount of water boiling '' to make pasta for their kid , and then correct it while shouting at me . 
  they 'd wall-off almost any child related communication ( like not tell me they had already picked her up from school , sending me into a near-police dialing panic when i could n't find her ) . 
  most memorable : they took all of the food overnight out of the pantry and fridge and fucked off for 2 weeks . 
  did n't return my calls or texts , and left me without pay or groceries . 
  when they came back and i demanded an explanation , they fired me ( leaving me homeless in a foreign country , this is where local friends come in ) . 
  of course your mileage can and will vary , but i had a terrible experience . 
  really depends on the family . 
  i was an au pair in germany ( now permanently resided here ) a few years ago and it was utter hell because the family was just horrific .
