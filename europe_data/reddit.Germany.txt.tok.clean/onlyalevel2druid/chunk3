  i 'd recommend using [ great au pair ] ( http://www.greataupair.com ) as it 's a fairly legitimate website ( i 'm not affiliated with it for promotional reasons ! ) . 
  all i would recommend is to know your rights 110 % and know what is and is not to be expected of you . 
  get as much as you can in writing and document cases of crazy . 
  be sure to make friends , preferably not other au pairs but locals . 
  it 'll help you learn the language and keep your perceptions reasonable . 
  if you choose germany and have questions , feel free to pm me . 
  he could simply insert `` like '' to make `` it tastes like nothing '' and it 's grammatical again . 
  i 've seen signs up encouraging people not to throw away perfectly good food in train stations recently . 
  signs like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pbym7kp.jpg ) ( `` every 8th grocery item we buy , we throw away . 
  you can change that . 
  too good for garbage ! '' ) . 
  the little apple kills me every time . 
   stop changing pronunciation and spelling of loan words almost every language does this to better suit its existing phonemes . 
  it 's not anywhere near exclusive to english . 
  you could almost see his eye twitch when talking about the `` lingua ** franca ** '' being english . 
  do you have the name of the documentary still ? 
  i 'd be interested in watching it , myself . 
  every pack of eggs i 've bought in germany has come with at least 1 feather and 1 shitsmear . 
  that 's why i said `` theoretically '' they are n't . 
  the truth is a lot more complex , and there 's a whole lot of bullshit that orbits gema , unfortunately :(, 
  theoretically , gema is a non-government entity ; they 're a `` verein . '', 
  in practice , it 's a dinosaur of a machine made up entirely of very talented lawyers . 
  also money . 
  lots of money . 
  this is interesting to me because as a third national immigrating to germany , you must go through great lengths to prove you have no intention of receiving welfare ( job , bank account , german national swearing to pay for you , etc ) . 
  where do you shop that you think fresh foods are expensive here ... ? 
  fruits/veggies are cheaper here than in the states , in my experience . 
  in order to receive the certificate , you must adequately pass some examination , yes . 
  well , if you 're a 3rd national married to a german , in order to receive the green-light for a 10 year spouse visa , you must prove you have attended through a b1 language course . 
  made sense to marry my spouse here where his job and better health care reside . 
  the assimilation is going pretty smoothly ; thumbs up to the german integrations courses for immigrants . 
  very very helpful . 
  yes , because they 're very much in danger . 
  delicious white european tears are what i feed on . 
  can you keep baaaawing for me please ? 
  ahh , i thought you meant germany-proper , not a specific region . 
  my mistake !, 
  actually there 's british forces in nrw and niedersachsen . 
  there 's also [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rheindahlen_military_complex ) , at least for a few years more . 
  that godforsaken berlin airport catastrophe . 
  there 's a lot of medicines that are just free , too . 
  i had a sinus infection and got a rezept for azithromycin ( antibiotic ) and it was 0 $ . 
  there 's actually a subset of insurances you can find online for such a thing . 
  i found my health insurance through google ; there 's another subset of insurance for non-german nationals living as students here . 
  the eli5 version is that there 's public and private options , but you must have insurance from one or the other . 
  public insurance is paid partially by your employer or in the case of students through your parents til a certain age ( at which point you probably wo n't pay in excess of 30 $ / mo ) . 
  even cheap public insurance for students is required to cover a certain amount of your medical . 
  a lot of medications are covered ( prescription , not otc ) . 
  i 'm not well-versed in private insurance inner-workings because i do n't know anyone who has it/have never had it myself . 
  i 'm a us citizen living in germany for a while , so i 'm thrilled with the care here . 
  they also abolished the 10 $ / per quarter `` praxisgeb\u00fchr '' at doctor 's offices , so less paperwork and i do n't have to pay the doc upfront !, 
  just checking . 
  i 'm not sure i treat women badly/like trophies , since i am one . 
  i guess / u/ufrustratedbro is just another / r/europe troll . 
  considering the comment at its worst had about -10 karma , i 'd say i 'm not mining for invisible internet points very well . 
  i was mocking the racist for complaining about immigrants muddying up the ~ pure european blood lines ~ . 
  i am indeed mocking the racist . 
  also , i am not a he . 
  i 'm confused : why am i being discussed ? 
  edit to add : i 'm female , and from a first world country . 
  i think regardless of age they 're her children . 
  does france not have mandatory language , history , and basic law integrations courses for immigrants like we do ? 
  how are these immigrants even appearing in france if they do n't work or go to school ? 
  are they undocumented ? 
  recently here , the court in karlsruhe just ordered a 60something turkish woman , who has 3 adult german-speaking kids , to attend german language courses . 
  i think op is referring to [ this ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/acad\u00e9mie_fran\u00e7aise ) , which is decidedly european french . 
  well you see i 'm doing it simply to muddle up the purity of europe as a whole . 
  so far so good . 
  i 'm mixed european immigrant and native american , and i neither hate myself nor deny my roots . 
  that 's a pretty bold ( misinformed ) statement there . 
  as an immigrant marrying an ethnic german : neener neener neener, 
  it 's a texas brewery but the bock is available nation-wide , afaik . 
  well , i 'm from there so lots and lots of beers . 
  i 'm fond of the shiner brewery , of course . 
  you know , i lived in texas for 20 years and i never once consumed bud/miller/pbr . 
  same language ?!, 
  who are you kidding !, 
  oh goodness no . 
  austria can take them back !, 
  american microbreweries are kicking german `` traditional '' brewers ( ie reinheitsgebot-following ) 's asses in international competitions all over the place . 
  that stereotype about american beer has n't been true since the 90s . 
  edit to add : if you 're buying/drinking things like bud or miller lite , you fully deserve your swill . 
  also , germany has fucking awful beer too , like jever . 
  fuck that beer . 
  i guess the netherlands . 
  amsterdam is lovely , also other more legalized things . 
  that 's part of the full set of obamacare . 
  [ a source ] ( http://www.healthcare.gov/law/timeline/ ) , for those downvoting . 
  it 's part of the affordable care act coming into effect on january 1 , 2014 . 
  best : my health care coverage !, 
  also karneval but that 's very localized . 
  worst : motherfucking world-famous b\u00fcrokratie . 
  hey mine is the cologne one !, 
  and yeah we 're pretty weird ... 
  aw i see mine !, 
  i 'm glad she liked them , 
  language classification can absolutely be artificial . 
  some linguistic lines are drawn down the political boundary . 
  have you ever been to texas ? 
  racism against blacks is not the racism du jour at all ...
