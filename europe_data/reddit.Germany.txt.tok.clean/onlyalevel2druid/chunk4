   what should be do who were victimized by the roma ? 
  contemplate about the socioeconical and historical factors in it while ** someone robs their house ? 
  **   the very fact that ** you mention stealing ** means you have zero first hand experience of the subject and should therefore shut up ( emphasis mine ) everything else having been pointed out , you were the one who brought up `` roma = thieves , '' not / u/krukzlip . 
  are you honestly comparing an entire race of people to rotting food sediment ? 
  that 's not in any way a compelling argument . 
  you can point at absolutely any `` culture '' and find things you disagree with . 
  talking about how terrible sinti/roma `` culture '' is , is just dressing up racism with a nice bow . 
   you are just looking to excuse the terrible gypsy-culture . 
  that 's an awfully fancy hat to give your racism , there . 
  it 's not exactly like that here , i think . 
  the job center is just very very pushy at sending you jobs unrelated to your skill set !, 
  they do n't care specifically about that , no , but when you upload said selfies to facebook , you give them the rights to use them commercially ( and make money ) . 
  they 're talking specifically about pictures of yourself ( which you should own cause they 're of you ) but in front of a famous place or building . 
  at least , that 's my take . 
  so should the infertile and people past menopause be disallowed marriage as well ? 
  look at the guys post history . 
  it 's not `` name calling '' if that 's precisely the rock he crawled out from under . 
  ameriboo ? 
  does that work ? 
  that 's pretty unsurprising . 
  i feel for those poor kids whose parents think that it 's for their benefit ... 
  i 'm from san antonio and am aware of at least 2 charter schools that use corporal punishment within city limits . 
  terrifying stuff . 
  fyi , incompetent, 
  that 's how it used to be in germany . 
  they 'd come to your door and try to con their way inside to count your tv-capable devices . 
  now every household just has to register and pay the stupid fee . 
  for those of us on mobile ; what 's the flair/meaning ? 
  but how can we say erdo\u011fan is undemocratic for not following turkey 's laws , if we do n't follow our own when it 's inconvenient to do so ? 
  i do n't think ( and certainly hope not ) the court will find b\u00f6hmermann guilty . 
  merkel just allowed for the independent courts to make the decision , instead of unilaterally saying `` this law does n't count . '', 
  because it 's a law that you ca n't insult foreign heads of state and erdo\u011fan 's delicate feelings got hurt enough to invoke it . 
  but you 're unable to see that something like a mean satirical poem is on a completely different ethical and moral level than murder ? 
  well this went from 0 to 60 alarmingly fast . 
  who knew satirical poem = murdering children ? 
  untalented and annoying have absolutely zero to do with whether he 's allowed to do that . 
  youtube is the one blocking vids because they fear having to potentially pay gema prices for them . 
  that 's a misconception that 's cleared up in what , 3 seconds ? 
  because he did n't call the police on the advice of others . 
  ah yes that pesky `` future crime '' thing that we do n't arrest people for because we 're a first world country * * not including actual conspiracy to commit crime , usw, 
  replied [ elsewhere ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zttaj/coverup_over_cologne_sex_assaults_blamed_on/cypb8aq ) to this quote . 
  can i get a link to this ? 
  and none of those groups would be part of the 800k refugees being referenced in other comments . 
  yes , i am myself an immigrant who was subject to mandatory german courses . 
  they potentially last quite a while . 
  these are not `` unprecedented . '', 
  police have reported that they suspect this is related to multiple other attacks spanning years . 
  that to me seems too provocative and ridiculous to possibly be real . 
  the refugees probably ca n't speak this level of german yet , and this just seems like race bait . 
  this heavily implies white german men do not also commit violent ( and sexual ) crime against women , which is of course not the case . 
  i need more information on the suspects before pinning this on refugees , to be honest . 
  we know they are `` north african '' but not if that means nationally or if they have `` migrationshintergrund , '' etc. 
  so i 'm guessing it 's too soon for the [ k\u00f6lner polizeibericht ] ( http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/12415/3218955 ) to have been translated yet , but it seems they have identified 16 potential suspects from the group ( of what our police chief said was approximately 20 men ) . 
  there have also been [ 2 arrested on new years , and 5 further arrests so far ] ( http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/12415/3218460 ) of people being investigated as having been involved . 
  i 'm most likely way too late to the thread for this to be seen , unfortunately . 
  and where did you get the idea that no one is being deported ? 
  no it 's been like this for a while . 
  these are not mutually exclusive . 
  the government already tries to integrate immigrants ( not refugees ) . 
  there 's an entire class-taking system that ends up being required of people coming from outside the eu that is only partially paid for that teaches valuable life skills like sorting trash ... 
  it 's the simpsons episode where they build a monorail in the city . 
  seems like a typo , to be honest . 
  k\u00f6ln here , despite healthy sibling rivalry i do n't want to consider the carnage of a suicide bomb or two along the streets of d'dorfer altstadt or near h heine allee ... : /, 
  i 'm telling you as a native you a ) cant drop the `` the '' ( as is stated in the link , which op did ) and b ) that it does n't seem to work with this word . 
   the adjective can not be used without the article ` the ' in these expressions . 
  so , nope . 
  also as a native english speaker it sounds wrong/bad to replace an existing noun form with a `` nounified '' adjective form . 
  `` the xenophobics '' does n't sound correct where `` the xenophobes '' is fine . 
  that 's not how english works, 
  all i asked for was a link to source german is fine . 
  thanks !, 
  the burden of proof is on the person making the claim , not the audience . 
  my connection where i was was pretty shit and i could n't get google to load ( and this comment presumably posted long after i hit `` submit '' ) . 
  i do n't really care to speculate on why that 's the case , but it 's my experience ( of course the plural of anecdote is not anecdata ) . 
  i am of neither german nor turkish/arab descent . 
  i am white-appearing immigrant myself . 
  as a woman in western europe , i 've been harassed significantly more by drunk ( white ) german men in public than turks or moroccans ... 
  do you have a source for that statistic ? 
  i 'm really curious . 
  your flair is incredible !, 
  and why should we care what breivik does or says ? 
  he , zsch\u00e4pe , mundlos , and b\u00f6hnhardt were/are worthless piles of neo-nazi garbage . 
  thankfully half of them are dead . 
  only until it 's born , that is . 
  then it needs to get a damn job !, 
  pm me if you 'd like another from germany , 
  yeah i have plenty of criticism of the us too . 
  that 's why i immigrated to germany . 
  what is a self-hating american doing in / r/europe anyway ? 
  yes i often need to visit a bezirksrathaus for purchasing items . 
  no need to get passive aggressive , friend . 
  and germany . 
  i absolutely hate that if i need to get something done , it 's got ta be early on saturday ( and god help you if it was a government thing : government offices are open from 8-12 :00 , only 4 days a week ! ) . 
  you are guaranteed that sunday boredom/malaise and being overall unproductive . 
  well that has less to do with making things up and more to do with only selectively enforcing this type of crime with political motivation as backing . 
  not to mention thugs in prison allowing in foreign doctors to examine her but barring them from doing any necessary testing . 
  that 's how they got al capone , too . 
  do n't fuck with the tax man . 
  this mouth-twitching ... it burns ... 
  where i 'm from ( non eu ) , id cards are also mandatory and they will take dna or at the very least all fingerprints for minor offenses .
