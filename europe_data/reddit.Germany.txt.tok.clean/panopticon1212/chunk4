  we 've had this before : these howitzers * were * used . 
  exercise is a use . 
  their pure presence is a use to the country of denmark because of their projection of military power and because they are there in case of emergency . 
  of course you can not directly compare a car to a howitzer , i was using that example to illustrate the need to replace technology after a certain time and use . 
  that `` as long as it gets the job done '' argument is irrelevant when we talk about military technology ( see below )  but as long as it can get me to the hospital or wherever i would need it the day i need it  tell me , do they make better concrete now than they did in the 1990s ? 
  do they make better steel or kevlar ? 
  usually , to kill people you do n't need much . 
  to shoot planes out of the sky , sure ... to destroy a submarine ... yeah . 
  but artillery is more of a hammer than a computer : as long as it 's heavy enough , it will do the job . 
  i have to suspect that you 're fundamentally unfamiliar with military technology , the speed of it 's advancement and especially with the need for armies to keep up with said advancement . 
  [ this wiki article about self propelled artillery might interest you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-propelled_artillery ), 
   that 's an answer , basically first one i got since this morning ... ok ... well in my first post i wrote :  to replace the aging equipment . 
  but anyway , if you have an unused 30 years old car , you would most definitely be thinking about a replacement , since a new car would be much more efficient , much safer , more capable , would have a greater resale value etc. 
  this is even more important in the military since technology is developing fast and you need to keep up with it . 
   putin sent troupes in ukraine as freedom fighters because he did n't want an open conflict . 
  well these freedom fighters are doing a mighty fine job keeping the peace by staying in the area and fighting the local population . 
  * are you fucking kidding me ? 
  * putin could have stayed out of mainland ukraine and the whole situation would be a lot less explosive , but no , he chose to sent in the `` freedom fighters '' . 
  also ... there would most definitely be an intervention should russia invade eu territory  in the mean time , fake news and social inequality are more dangerous for our union and more exploitable than our armies ... that is true , but it 's not an argument against maintaining a capable military . 
   like ? 
  economy and taxation , the banking sector , reforms in the social sector , infrastructure etc. . .  and why spend 2 % ? 
  i did n't say they should but that 's the nato requirement . 
  and , when looking at the state of the german army right now , that is probably necessary ...  why not 1 % or as my numbers show , 0.5 % to be on par with the closest threat . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  you want to have a technological advantage . 
  also , military costs are higher in the eu than in russia for example, 
  yes it does . 
  but the equipment getting so old , that a replacement makes sense from a technological and financial perspective . 
   why do you think i oppose the buying of guns if they 're needed . 
  i 'm not sure why , really ...  does questioning spending make me a traitor if it 's defense/war no . 
  no one has said that, 
  you have your priorities mixed up a little . 
  only two eu states are spending more than 2 % of their gdp on the military . 
  there are * plenty * of other areas to tackle poverty and social injustice before you should use your military 's finances for it . 
  it 's used all the time . 
  thankfully only for exercises , though i 'm not sure if they have used artillery in afghanistan . 
  it 's not like military equipment can only be considered as `` being used '' when shooting at people . 
  a well equipped and well trained military is a show of strength and a necessity in the world we live in . 
  this has become increasingly obvious in recent years . 
  to replace the aging equipment . 
  just like a car or a computer , you sometimes have to replace the old worn-out stuff with newer , more advanced stuff . 
  kinda makes sense , does n't it ? 
  good shit go\u0c66\u0501 shit thats \u2714 some good shit right there right \u2714 there \u2714 \u2714 if i do \u01bda\u04af so my self i say so thats what im talking about right there right there ( chorus : \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b3\u1d49 ) mmmmm\u13b7\u041c \u041do0\u041e\u0b20ooooo\u041e\u0b20\u0b20oooo\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52 good shit, 
  * sharply exhales through nose *, 
  one has to keep in mind that he * always * says these things at public campaign speeches . 
  there is no `` official '' statement by the ministry of foreign affairs . 
  no internal discussion with the cabinet . 
  no rallying for international support . 
  there will be no `` call on international organizations to impose sanctions on the netherlands '' , because nobody would follow it . 
  it 's political `` hot air '' in it 's purest form . 
  he just says whatever the fuck he wants . 
  his followers ca n't figure out that it 's pure bull and are going to support him no matter what . 
  every reaction out of europe is just stigmatized as anti erdogan/turkey and he can continue to portray himself as the strongman who has the guts to stand up to the big bad west . 
  ignoring him is the best strategy . 
  it 's a tragedy for turkey , atat\u00fcrk must be rolling in his grave ... 
  lol ... crosspost that to r/nottheonion, 
  right , that makes more sense ... 
  i have to let go of that old fashioned view that everything east of the iron curtain is `` eastern '', 
  in what way ? 
  belarus , sure . 
  ukraine as well . 
  the rest of eastern europe is flooded with nato troops . 
  energy exports are the only other instrument of influence for russia , but admittedly a significant one . 
  but that does not make russia * dominate * eastern europe ... 
  maybe , yeah . 
  it 's certainly a very confusing terminology . 
  i 'm still leaning towards centralization of governance ...  russia in central asia and eastern europe russia dominating eastern europe ? 
   china and india , both are as diverse as europe is . 
  i 'm strictly speaking about governance . 
  because i think that 's what xi jinping is actually talking about . 
   the eu / single market has been a great negotiating with china . 
  that 's true but you still have a significant level of political uncertainty because member states fighting over whatever is on the menu today . 
  that bleeds into business to a certain extent, 
  that 's true , but you could differentiate inside most european countries as well . 
  maybe not ethnically , but certainly culturally . 
  if you hear the phrase `` world region '' i guess most people think of a multinational community at first . 
  but i think that what xi jinping is trying to say , is that he likes to see one centralized government for these `` regions '' , like in china , india or the us . 
  `` world region '' is just a weird phrase for it ... 
  yes ... 
   geopolitical region sure , this is a well established concept . 
  but he was specifically talking about countries that are - according to him - already `` world regions '' . 
  others , like southeast asia , latin america or europe are becoming or should become `` world regions '' . 
  europe * is * a geopolitical region , but we should become a `` world region '' . 
  and i think what he wants is a centralized government for easier political and economical relations . 
  as `` easy '' as it would be , if your dealing with a single country . 
  i 'm not judging , only trying do decipher ... 
  `` world region '' cool ... what 's that supposed to be ? 
  us , china and india are * countries * , europe is probably the closest you can get to a `` world region '' right now . 
  what he wants is the transfer of more governance from member states to the eu , which would make it easier for china and others to do business , politics etc. . . 
  * nice * i think it was `` the dutchess and the devil '' ( 3rd ), 
  `` a damp , foggy island nor ' - nor ' - east of ushant - think you can find it ? '', 
  which movie ? 
  i would n't call others political amateurs and then write that naive stuff you just wrote . 
  it really is n't as easy as you make it out to be . 
  if germany , or any other reasonably well functioning democracy , plays the same or actually worse tricks than erdogan is playing , they are weakening their credibility to criticize erdogan . 
  think about the implications of not allowing erdogan 's plane to land , or declaring a turkish minister persona non grata . 
  merkel would make a fool out of herself . 
  politically , erdogan behaves like a 16 year old at the hight of puberty . 
  you do n't want to let yourself down on that level ... 
  classic logic of american politics : a carnival wagon criticizes trump ?
