i have to say , i like it . 
  no offense to romanians , but you are still sort of the poor guys of the eu . 
  the sooner we got you up with eu money , the sooner you can buy expensive shit from my country , or the other countries of the west , which may sound egoistical , but you would benefit too . 
  last resort , pull out some boobs . 
  good to know . 
  except that there never were 1,6 billion jews . 
  or countries under jewish law . 
  i ca n't even think of a country that has/had a jewish majority , with the exception of israel , which is rather new . 
  there also never was a declaration of war by jewish fundamentalists on all non-believers . 
  or big jewish terrorist attacks . 
  jews also never tried to convert non-believers by force . 
  they do n't try to convert at all . 
  i see a slight difference , but that 's just me . 
  is n't it weird that you now need extreme courage to do stuff like this ? 
  on any other conference you would get cheering or at best some disgruntled looks for showing your tits . 
  you would n't fear injuries or death . 
  the problem is that the two of us have something to lose , if we would ignore our government policies . 
  as a refugee , you can just try again , and again in another city until it worked , burning government resources on your way . 
  sooner or later the system will collapse . 
  you can actually make your fingerprints unrecognizable with simple tools . 
  and for pictures you would need software that is able to compare human faces far beyond what we have now , ignoring all logistical problems we would have with such a policy . 
  and i ca n't even imagine the shit storm that would follow if we implemented those measures . 
  left newspaper headline : '' ahmed was wrongfully denied asylum by software bug !!!, 
  look at this picture of his sad looking kid !! '', 
  [ works great . 
   make them form an orderly queue in syria while they 're getting bombed ? 
  you seriously believe they come directly from syria ? 
   all men are born free and equal we should ask the refugees if they would agree . 
  or if they would exclude women , or gay people , or non-believers . 
  if you come from a medieval country burning in a religious war , you should n't expect the same moral standards as you think they have . 
  what if you would burn your papers before arrival in germany ? 
  not much , really . 
  at first i would like our government to actually honor existing treaties and laws . 
  after that the democratic process could start , with things like how much we should help them in their country , or the most affected once . 
  how many we should let immigrate , etc. . . at the moment it seems the `` might makes right '' stance of hundreds of thousands of refugees who demand to be let in is a rather retarded political policy . 
  maybe . 
  but it would be nice to have at least a somewhat more democratic process for the decision to let a million people in the shortest amount of time immigrate . 
  not just `` merkel said ... '', 
  i 'm wondering if she asked her citizens if they want to be `` occupied and changed '' . 
  you got a source for that ? 
   is not about 3rd or 2nd generation immigrants true for the first two , but it gives a good impression of the general problem . 
  the last is about 2nd and 3rd generation pupils though . 
  and a child , which spoke only a foreign language until kindergarten has sometimes a very hard time to learn a second laguage ( german ) on the needed level . 
  which led to my statement  we 've lots of 3rd generation immigrants who can barely speak german . 
  i 'm not sure where i contradict myself . 
  or if they have a child which grew up accustomed to germany . 
  or they marry or have a kid with a german .

  a buzzword for `` i do n't agree with you '' ? 
  you ca n't expect other people to provide sources for you , if you claim something . 
   see , the cowboy is getting the attention because that is rather unique . 
  `` we have one woman wearing a burka where i live . '', 
  my first post . 
  you ca n't provide a source ? 
  if i knock on your door , fully naked , would you treat me the same as a police officer ? 
  please provide a source .

  ever been to a german city , new yorker ? 
  and i bet you would n't mind if a naked cowboy is stared at . 
  why do you mind something equally weird is stared at ? 
  if a pink elephant flies over your home , do you look and think `` wtf ? '', 
  or are you too much a hipster for that ? 
  i can think of 800000 reasons coming over right now . 
  exactly . 
  by that logic most of germany should request asylum in luxembourg . 
  the best of the best are coming to europe / s,

  found the article ? 
  or are you just bullshitting ?

  we have one woman wearing a burka where i live . 
  the funniest thing is everybody is outright staring at her , because of the weird as fuck look of those things . 
  if she would n't wear it no one would even notice her , defeating the whole purpose of a burka . 
  source ? 
  now i 'm curious . 
  what does irish/swiss german sound like ? 
  austrians are german , too ? 
  do n't let the austrians know !, 
  ww1 and ww2 ( by proxy ) / s, 
  but in the context of this thread , germany is n't a good comparison , as the new state of catalonia would n't need to fear external military intervention , if the debt would not be repayed ( in not deflatable gold ) . 
  in the context of germany and hitlers rise to power , you 're absolutly right , though . 
  solidarity / s although that does n't keep us warm in winter .
