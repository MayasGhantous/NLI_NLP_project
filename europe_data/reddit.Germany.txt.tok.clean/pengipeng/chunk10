  coompare that to [ australia ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/australia-government-budget-value.png?s=australiagovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20081231&amp;type=column ) ( 6.5 times gdp , 2.3 times population , lots of ressources , industries , you know your country better then i do ) , which averaged a slight surplus of ca . 
  300 million $ aud . 
  compare that to [ spain ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-government-budget-value.png?s=spaingovbudval&amp;d1=20030101&amp;d2=20081231&amp;type=column ) ( 6 times gdp , 4 times population , big agriculture , some industry , tourists ) , which averaged to 5 billion $ in quarterly deficit . 
  compare ** that ** to greece : 354 billion gdp ( 2008 ) , 11 million people , one varoufuckthis . 
  these are all numbers from 2001-2008 , except germany ( til 2014 ) and spain ( from 2003 ) . 
  but then we had this inconvient crisis coming around , [ and ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-government-budget-value.png?s=spaingovbudval&amp;d1=20030101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) [ it ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/australia-government-budget-value.png?s=australiagovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) [ hit ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/ireland-gdp.png?s=wgdpirel&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) [ hard ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/romania-government-budget-value.png?s=romaniagovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) as laid out above , greece spent lots and lots of other peoples money , even in the good times . 
  but now come the bad times . 
  as the crisis hit , everyone is in panic mode . 
  huge amount of bailout money get pumped in the banks . 
  and as soon as the smoke lighted up a bit , many eurozone countries , and lots of non-eurozone countries , had problems to pay their bills . 
  but , as we are a union , we help our members in need . 
  so we started to create help mechanisms ( efsf , efsm , etc. ) . 
  these help mechanism are constructed as loans and backed by the huge economic power of the european union , with interest rates way lower then normal market rates and running times which can be extended at will ( factually a debt haircut financed by the less hard hit countries ) . 
  one after another , the hardest hit countries apply for help ( greece , ireland , spain , portugal ) and get loans in the billions to help their economy . 
  in turn they have to agree to cut government spending and reduce their deficit . 
  years go by and most countries are at least stable or actually growing again ( ireland grows again , spain too , portugal is stable ) but what is with greece ? 
  greece actually built a fragile house of cards , financed by the low interest rates before the crisis . 
  [ look ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-bond-yield.png?s=gggb10yr&amp;d1=19980101&amp;d2=20151231 ) at the interest they paid on 10 year bond . 
  do you see them going down 2001 ? 
  they came down from rates of 10-15 % before the euro . 
  this is german level of credit , as most banks thought , germanys government is de-facto lender of last resort . 
  so , what do the greeks do with this platinum credit ? 
  they spent , and that in the stupidest way possible , for consumption . 
  average retirement age for public workers : 56 ( 15.6.2015 ) . 
  military spending , laughably high salaries for public workers , lots of useless and unproductive government jobs , tax evasion ( yes , you effectively pay for tax evasion by lost taxes ) . 
  and all that with a productive basis , that is at best thin . 
  but their gdp blows up like an airbag . 
  lots of money in greek hands to spend on stuff . 
  for the big part loans , but what do they care . 
  their trade deficit [ blows up ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-balance-of-trade.png?s=gktbale&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) . 
  they produce a bit , but spend a lot . 
  the crisis comes around and their house of cards falls . 
  they get bailed out . 
  private creditors take a 50 % loss , but can finally walk away . 
  efsf , iwf , ecb pump more and more money into greece and demand austerity , to get their huge public sector down to sustainable levels . 
  as the public sector is cut , all the unproductive public workers loose their jobs and salaries . 
  gdp contracts 25 % ( not much , if you consider the party they had before ) . 
  european countries send more loans ( i repeat , with rates the greeks could n't even dream to get on the free market ) . 
  fucking eastern european countries , way poorer then greece , take up loans to help them . 
  eu now owns 75 % of greek debt . 
  greeks start crying : `` austerity is bad !, 
  it does n't work ! '', 
  riiiiight . 
  greek gdp finally [ grows again ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) . 
  unemployment goes [ down ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-unemployment-rate.png?s=umrtgr&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) debt stays [ somewhat stable . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-debt-to-gdp.png?s=grcdebt2gdp&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) they demand ( sic ! ), 
  more money . 
  samaras is thrown out of government . 
  tsipras , a communist , is voted in . 
  he calls varoufakis as finance minister . 
  first actions are recall of past reforms . 
  thousand of public workers get hired again , after samaras fired them . 
  varoufakis plays his games . 
  tsipras demands ( sic ! ), 
  better terms with the creditors . 
  they disagree . 
  greece walks out of negotiations with creditors . 
  tsipras does n't know what to do . 
  varoufakis wants to play a game . 
  they call for a referendum , where they ask , if the last proposal of the creditors should be accepted ( i guess ??? ) . 
  they probably hope for a yes , so they can quit as government . 
  they people vote no . 
  many sad faces . 
  greece has a party , says fuck you to rest of europe . 
  creditors are pissed . 
  varoufakis rage quits . 
  and here we are now . 
  and after all that , we now should at first forgive their debt ? 
  let 's compare the whole thing with ireland . 
  crisis hits . 
  ireland is in big financial problems . 
  ireland applies for help from iwf and eu . 
  ireland gets 67 billion $ euro . 
  agrees to austerity . 
  ireland cuts spending . 
  ireland grows 4.8 % in 2014 . 
   it needs to be significantly reduced yeaah ... we tried that [ already ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-debt.png?s=greecegovdeb&amp;d1=20050101&amp;d2=20151231 ) . 
  other sugestions ? 
  it 's funny how we are sometimes a family , sometimes terrorists and nazis , sucking from the teet of the greek people and holding down their glorious democracy . 
  i 'm beginning to understand what an abusive relationship feels like . 
  um ... where exactly did he destroy him ? 
  could you elaborate ? 
   so what , did you think i wasnt aware that ex commie eastbloc countrys are better of now ? 
   did you know that the poor in the late ddr were better off than the poor in the usa today ? 
   i pointed out that even if communism is shit , our capitalism is only marginally better . 
   obviously ... lol god you are a fucking idiot , go read my post again . 
   would you argue that you dont have to clean your toilet because the shitstain in your neighbors toilet is twice as big as yours ? 
  ask the polish , baltics and romanians how much better their turd smells as capitalist democracies now , in comparison to communist times . 
  do you have any kind of argument ? 
  that 's the point . 
  they did n't . 
  the public sector was blown out of proportion and inflated the greek gdp beyond reasonable levels . 
  but now that this bullshit gets cut down to the actual economic development , many greeks cry about lost gdp and harmful austerity . 
  did you know that the greek economy was finally [ growing ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq&amp;d1=19950101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) again , after all the spending cuts ? 
  then tsipras and his genius varoufakis came around and threw it all under the bus . 
   despite it being the the correct move to bolster the economy . 
  i seriously doubt that . 
  they have an extremely inflated public sector , with high levels of corruption . 
  if you would have thrown more money into that black hole , you would have just delayed the in inevitable , which is spending cuts of the greek state . 
  true .
