  france had a trade deficit for the last years ( for the most part with germany ) , yet they produce a lot of wealth in a wide range of sectors ( cars , industry , energy , culture ) . 
  france was the most popular tourist destination for years now ( in my opinion justified ) . 
  they produce a lot of stuff with a high demand in the rest of the world . 
  they have a very high productivity ( higher then germany ) . 
  but greece ? 
  they demand to have the same standart of living without having the economic output to justify that demand . 
  that 's why i linked the the gdp statistic for greece . 
  i just do n't understand , how the greeks can argue for getting more stuff , without backing it up with reality . 
  agreed . 
  you 're actually comparing the us , the biggest economy in the world , with the most important currency in the world ( oil is traded in dollar ) , a military with bases all over the world and some of the most innovative industries ( again ) in the world , with greece ? 
  the us actually has the power to just demand beneficial terms , what could greece do ? 
  ask for more loans of the ecb ? 
  just to give you a sense who you are comparing here : greece gdp ( highest ever , 2008 ) : 354 billion $ , 11 million people usa gdp ( 2011 ) 15094 billion $ , 317 million people you must be beyond delusional , if you think that is a intelligent comparison . 
  the us trade deficit was on average about 40 billion $ . 
  the deficit of greece , with a fraction of population and economy , was 4 billion $ . 
  to go further , around 70 % of the trade deficit of the us is with china , which produces practically all consumer products these days . 
  fuck , the romanians , the `` poor '' guys in the eu , have notable industries ( dacia , it ) . 
  what does greece produce ? 
  olive oil ? 
  still better then the slow decay in communist and socialist societies . 
  i 'm wondering , if the greeks realize how [ inflated ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp.png?s=wgdpgree&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20151231 ) their gdp was in the last years , without actually [ producing ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-balance-of-trade.png?s=gktbale&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) anything important . 
  it was all just loans and more loans . 
  if you look at the [ employment rates ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-unemployment-rate.png?s=umrtes&amp;d1=19760101&amp;d2=20151231 ) for spain the euro actually seems to be a pretty big advantage for the spanish people ( at least until the 2009 crisis hit us all ) . 
  which is why i ca n't quite understand the resentment some spaniards ( not you personaly ) have against the euro . 
  is it just populism from your extreme parties ? 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-gdp-growth.png?s=spnagdpq&amp;d1=19950101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column spain looks quite promising . 
  edit : even [ greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq&amp;d1=19950101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) had a silverlining , but then came tsipras and his joke of a government . 
  agreed . 
  i highly doubt most bild readers could argue in english , not to mention the average one . 
  but hey , good ad hominem , i guess . 
  god i love this shit . 
  http://money-go-round.eu/year.aspx?year=0 ever heard of [ agenda 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) ? 
  directly after we implemented the euro , we got huge economic problems because of it . 
  we implemented austerity measures and got ourselves competitive again . 
  good that we share the same opinion on the matter , although from different sides . 
  okay , fuck this i 'm out . 
  from now on i will vote for whatever german party is anti euro and anti eu and will bring us out of this shit . 
  if that joke of a government in greece even gets sympathy , whats the point . 
  fuck them and fuck the eu, 
  the guardian quoted three words out of context and now some people think that means he is in favour of greek actions . 
  the others are doing reasonably well and only greece is on the constant brink of implosion . 
  i 'm sure the germans are at fault here . 
  the lottery , the most important basis for industrial production . 
  holy fuck , are you a propaganda minister or something ? 
  ever heard of agenda2010 ? 
  he probably is . 
  we have a lot those . 
  original sin with nazis and stuff . 
  which is a very expert move , when you want money from the people you made look like amateurs . 
  i think , this is a great idea . 
  it 's not like the greeks hold a monopoly on democracy . 
  if such a democratic referendum is issued , greece should better accept the outcome talking high and mighty about democracy all the time . 
  although it probably wo n't be in their favor . 
  that is literally what some greeks think , although probably out of ignorance . 
  well , the finns or you , at least , have gained a big amount of respect from me , if that is your stance . 
  is it a widely held view in finland ? 
  well , others should foot his bills in his opinion , so i guess ... [ lets party !, 
  and now she got a fuck you right in the face by the greek people themselves for her engagement . 
  i wonder whats going on in the kanzleramt right now ... 
  who , in your opinion should foot the bill in all that lovely debt forgiveness ? 
  yep , and the meaning is `` we [ the german government ] will not let them starve to death '' . 
  german vice-chamcellor gabriell made clear , that humanitarian aid will be brought to the greek , if needed . 
  that 's what he said two days ago i think . 
  sch\u00e4uble is acting in line with his boss and does n't want to be painted as someone who lets the greek people starve . 
  how the guardian spins that to a `` sch\u00e4uble is totally positive with greece '' i can not tell . 
  oh sorry , i just thought you 're mocking my english proficiency and i did n't see why . 
  is there a typo or grammatically something wrong with that sentence ? 
  what the fuck did he say ? 
  sch\u00e4uble : `` ob mit euro oder vor\u00fcbergehend ohne : diese frage k\u00f6nnen nur die griechen selbst beantworten '' translation : '' with euro or temporarily without : only the greeks themselves can decide this . '', 
  translation : `` even if some banks collapse , the probability of spread [ to other parts of the eurozone ] is small . 
  `` the market barely reacted in the last days . 
  that shows that the problem [ the greek economy collapsing ] is manageable . '', 
  does that sound something like a positive few for greece in the euro for you ? 
  seriously , as a german , if you read the source in german , it basically has the feeling of `` i do n't give a fuck about greece anymore '' from sch\u00e4uble . 
  well , as far as i know , we lended them `` just '' 80 billion from their total of 360 , but i get what you 're saying . 
  if merkel allows a better deal for the greeks , german voters will kill her at the next voting . 
  sch\u00e4uble , german finance minister and hardlainer against greece bailouts , had 70 % approval from german population this week . 
  hell no . 
  calling the german government nazis and shit was a big nono for me . 
  by now i really do n't give a shit about greek governments anymore . 
  let them all go to economic hell . 
  no one will starve . 
  humanitarian relief is already guaranteed by the german vice-cancellor gabriell and merkel . 
  the greek economy will go to the shitter though . 
  it 's over , is n't it ? 
  they voted no as far as german tv is concerned . 
  it will be exciting to see what happens next . 
  you really think greece is that important , in your nationalistic fever ? 
  xd their whole economy has the size of one german city . 
  `` if they do n't give us money the eu will be destroyed ! '', 
  blackmail ? 
  no , official greek government policy . 
  also , factually wrong . 
  while true that australia is rich , they also have a very small population ( wikipedia say 23 million ) . 
  compare that to indonesia ( where most of their refugees come from ) with 240 million . 
  for me it 's understandable , why they take drastic measures to deal with the problem . 
  [ interesting read about australia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asylum_in_australia ) tl ; dr : they send them to camps and evaluate their legitimacy for refugee status , then send them back if possible . 
  if not possible , they stay detained ( one guy was detained for six years , that must be expensive ) . 
  but were would we send them then ? 
  we could try to make a deal with some northern african country to take them in , but that would be the same as sending them to camps and probably expensiv .
