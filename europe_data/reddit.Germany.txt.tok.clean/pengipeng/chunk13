  in 20 years every working person has to provide for almost one pension , and that is with 100 000 net immigrants each year . 
  it might gets worse if immigration goes down , hence why media , merkel and all parties are extremely in favour of immigration . 
  germany is actually even way worse than japan in terms of birthrates , but we hide that with immigration . 
  it 's not far fetched to say that germans will be a minority in their own country in 30-40 years . 
  the part of depressing wages is probably not true . 
  the situation is way more desperate . 
  from the 80 million people in germany 31 million are over 50 ( the biggest part of what is left of ethnic germans , also the big proponents of mass immigration ) . 
  there are 9 million people between 18-30 . 
  7 million under 18 . 
  the point of this whole thing with mass immigration is to find people who will pay the pensions for the over 50 year olds . 
  i doubt that he is from the middle east/north africa, 
   there are many racists in germany what is many ? 
  is n't 10 already many if you meet them in a group to fuck you up ? 
   your comment on the other hand made it look like you were justifying said attacks as group punishment that was n't my intention and i do n't approve of this attacks , but i ca n't stand it when somebody tries to deflect the discussion by pointing out unrelated bullshit . 
  do the attacks justify the sexual assaults ? 
  obviously not , and i know that you all agree . 
  what is the purpose of that comment then ? 
  painting germans as racists to be able to maintain the narrative of innocense . 
   pre-canned responses that comment i wrote is a new one . 
  please go ahead and google it . 
  i 'm sure you 're eager to do so . 
   my point is not that all forreigners are holy innocent people that would never do anything bad . 
  my point is that people act as there would be no racism in germany and that this country is just too deep in historic guilt . 
  but often accusations of racism are based on recent events . 
  you are saying that there are racists in a country of 80 million people ? 
   what worries me , is that the first reaction to of many people ( especially here on reddit ) after the happenings in cologne was not `` what happened exactly ? 
  '' , `` how was it possible ? '', 
  or `` we should find those guilty ! '', 
  these are the reactions you see from people on reddit . 
   but rathermore `` a , you see germany ? 
  told ya so . 
  refugees are bad ! '', 
  as if they are just hoping for anything to happen ... 
  these are reactions you also see on reddit . 
  your statement basically has no point , besides your discontent with people stating their opinions freely . 
  his comment creates the impression that germans are violent . 
  i contributed a little reality check in that regard . 
   you ca n't really put people in prison because they refuse to tell you where they come from . 
  you can , atleast in germany . 
  it 's called ` beugehaft ' and part of due process in some cases . 
   and even if you could , they would just have to claim to come from a country where we ca n't send them back it is not that easy to pull that off . 
  you 'd need the to know the local map , atleast to some degree ( nearest cities from your home ) . 
  you would have to know the right language and the right accent . 
  it 's not that easy . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/rechtspflege/strafverfolgungvollzug/strafverfolgungdeutschlandpdf_5243105.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) is the official statistic for convicted criminals , issued by the german government . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.bka.de/de/publikationen/polizeilichekriminalstatistik/pks__node.html?__nnn=true ) is the statistic of the bundeskriminalamt , basically german fbi , for all crimes committed . 
  in both , foreign nationals unproportionally often are suspect of or convicted of a crime , including sexual and violent crimes . 
  i know you do n't like what has happened in germany as it is contrary to your world view , but pleace consider reality in your assessment of the `` violent , racist '' german . 
  prison until they tell you ? 
  interrogate them ? 
  are we all helpless 10 year old girls in europe or something ? 
  that would be pretty arrogant , coming from a german like me while mass sexual assaults are happening in my country . 
  only for animals ( bears , dogs , etc ), 
  [ convicted ciminals by german/non-german individuals ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/rechtspflege/strafverfolgungvollzug/strafverfolgungdeutschlandpdf_5243105.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  do you want official statistics about foreigners commiting unpropotionally more crimes ? 
  noble . 
  what happens when a woman does ' t have a righteous man close to her ? 
  you know that , if the police men would not be automatically alarmed by such behaviour , one of them would have probably been stabbed , do n't you ? 
  better safe than stabbed seems like a good measure to me . 
  it looks like a german flag if you take the dark , black shadow as the top black part . 
  top left similar , but tilted to the side . 
  that 's why i specified that the germans were in the minority . 
  g\u00fcnther and horst ( the top 3 of german names are peter , michael und thomas by the way ) do n't help much if another hundred mohammeds stand behind ahmed . 
  police could n't react because it was new years and they were overstretched . 
  the federal statistical office in germany . 
  total convictions ( 2013 ) : 755 938 germans : 570 896 foreigners : 185 042 the data provides data from the years 2007-2013 and nicely shows the growth of crime in the foreigner section and the decline in the german section . 
  you know that the perpetrators of the attacks in cologne were part of a group of more than 1000 `` north african '' / arabic men , the majority in that place and time ? 
  what do you think ahmed does , when he sees that his buddy mohammed gets attacked by some filthy german infidel and he did n't see why ? 
  you see , there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric region that was once known as europe . 
  indeed that 's what we provide in our own modest , humble , insignificant ... oh , fuck it . 
  okay . 
  you got 10-20 dudes in their 20s going on a sexual assault spree . 
  what do you think you could do , personally . 
  as victim in that moment ? 
  you 're correct . 
  you found a typo . 
  the official german one does n't have that mistake , same page , you even see where those weird numbers come from . 
  let me guess , everything that is said in the official german one is now blatantly false ? 
  could you tell me which page you quoted ? 
  dude , seriously ? 
  [ here ] ( https://www.bka.de/nn_257310/shareddocs/downloads/en/publications/policecrimestatistics/2014/pks2014__englisch.html ) is the same statistic in english from the official page . 
  you really try hard now , do n't you ? 
  please express your points in a more civil way . 
  i feel threatened here . 
  / s `` then you might be fine in the future '' , said the stasi agent in 1986 to the student with differing opinions . 
  you really get ridiculous . 
  you ca n't read statistics and you do n't even know what you yourself were writing . 
  your statement : `` if alll leftists believe in this , how do you explain the discrepancy between the left ruling in europe for a few decades , yet there still clearly are nations and borders ? '', 
  my statement : `` is n't the eu the ultimate institution to tear down borders and equalize european nations ? 
  dude , why are you punching yourself ? '', 
  my questions to you : do you know what schengen is ? 
  did you ever hear of the treaty of lisbon ? 
  are you older than 16 ? 
  | unapologetic censorship of differing opinions if that is not ridiculous for some , including for you , i would really suggest to immigrate to the dictatorship of your choice . 
  out of interest , what do you think of the german democratic republic ? 
  and again ... 
  your selective reading amazes me . 
  foreigners in germany are people living ( temporalily or otherwise ) in germany without german citizenship . 
  what you mean with your 20 % are germans with a migration background . 
  you see the difference ?
