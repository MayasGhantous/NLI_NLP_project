  seems to be a raid with heavy resistance . 
   we ** effectively ** banned the bible already . 
  `` the abdeslam family said they were `` surprised '' that ibrahim blew himself up , even though he had spent time in syria . '', 
  well , they were `` surprised '' ... she really could n't see this coming ... 
  well , they atleast get lots of new recruits time and again , as so many muslims agree with them ( in contrast to pkk ) . 
  take away islam from isis . 
  how long would their nation survive ? 
  how many people from western nations would join them ? 
  they did go to war to eradicate jews and conquer new `` lebensraum '' . 
  that are literally some of the goals isis has . 
  and they use a sick , twisted ideology to legitimice that . 
  i mean , can you really not see the parallels ? 
  could you cite a source of conflicts involving members of the holy roman empire but not the emperor ? 
  [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:wars_involving_the_holy_roman_empire ) says 36 . 
  witch trials are not a war . 
  [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_germany ) says 28 . 
  nazis had gained power in germany in 1933 . 
  why is that ? 
  pakistan ai n't that great . 
  indonesia since 2014 has full blown sharia law in effect , including gems like stoning for adultery, 
  you call it terrorism . 
  the islamic state calls it an operation in an ongoing war . 
  which of you is right ? 
  we effectively banned the bible already . 
  we call that part of history `` enlightenment '' for a reason . 
  if a politician would state that his policies are mainly based on the literal text of the bible , he would be ridiculed . 
  meanwhile a huge majority of muslims actively support sharia law , the literal interpretation of the quran as law ... -  [ link ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/ ), 
  they cite the verses directly from the quran , and the book is quite clear and in approval in what the salafists preach ... it 's almost too easy for extremists . 
  then we disagree . 
  read the quran . 
  it completely justifies the actions isis does . 
  the moderates rely on interpretations . 
  the quran itself is quite clear on the matter . 
  just read it and tell me what you think . 
  [ here is a link ] ( http://quran.com/ ) i 'd recommend 4 ( `` the women '' ) . 
  really is an eye opener . 
  now you 'll go and tell me `` but the bible says ... '' then i would ask you how much western values rely on the bible today . 
  i really dislike the trend of westerners after 9/11 to justify the islamists actions with the bible . 
  show me a passage in the bible that promotes horrible stuff and i will tell you that that passage is complete and utter bullshit , not the word of god and made up by some backwater iron age retard . 
  try to find a muslim that will say the same about any passage in the quran and you 'll know why that is a retarded comparison . 
  i personally would go with side that can find evidence for their claims . 
  edit : which would be the dude that says 31 , maybe 50, 
  okay , but that makes him a useless source , when the other historian could only find evidence for far less deaths . 
  well , the quran atleast claims to be the literal word of god . 
  hard to refute anything written in it , if you believe in allah . 
  and the moves the fanatics make are very much reasonable according to the quran . 
  i read it today for the first time , as i could n't believe that this attrocities were grounded in their beliefs . 
  they very much are . 
  i would really like you to read it , if only to be able to claim that you read it . 
  then you can tell me , if i 'm wrong or right . 
  i found 4 ( `` the women '' ) very interesting . 
  explains a lot of their actions . 
  needs about 15-30 min . 
  [ here is a link ] ( http://quran.com/ ), 
  are his words the literal word from god , though ... 
  do you know how the nazis gained so much power so fast ? 
  they had a fruitful ground in the german population with a lot of people sympathizing with them and outright praising them , for what they did and joining them in their efforts . 
  ... wait ... that seems similar to today to some particular group ... what was it 's name again ? 
  starts with an i i think ... 
  which ideology do you think is closer to the current situation ? 
  hitler with him demanding the death of all jews and murdering them with his brown gangs , or jews living in europe very peacefully . 
  which one would describe militant islam the best ? 
  holy fuck , when did this happen ? 
  i have actually read some bigger passages of the quran today , and i must say , if they get worse than that pamplet already is ... 
  why does he use this extremely high number ? 
  edit : i see , some of you guys do n't like that question . 
  as far as i can tell from the news , most of them were french or belgian citizens . 
  what would that mean , considering the argument you make ? 
  and this correction is in itself false . 
  it 's even written in the link that guy posted . 
  `` the french government commission in 1998 claimed only 48 people died . 
  the historian jean-luc einaudi ( la bataille de paris , paris : seuil , 1991 ) asserted that as many as 200 algerians had been killed . 
  the historian jean-paul brunet found satisfactory evidence for the murder of 31 algerians , while suggesting that a number of up to 50 actual victims was credible . '', 
  we have a weirdly high dude with 200 , and a dude found evidence for something in the range of 30-50 , which would be close tothe government number . 
  why does he use this extremely high number ? 
  see my first comment . 
  depends . 
  if you assume that the quran is the direct word of god ( which fundamentalists do ) , it 's perfectly reasonable to do this stuff . 
  i see , the [ whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) is in full speed again . 
  let that error be 50 % . 
  you now have between 7.5-22 .5 % people supporting isis . 
  let 's go with the lower value , because tolerance . 
  also , what the hell , let us half that again . 
  there are now 2.5 million people supporting isis in france . 
  i used that because it was the first thing that came up and was in english . 
  [ here is another one from germany ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13845521/scharia-haelt-einzug-in-deutsche-gerichtssaele.html ) , but only in german . 
  do n't know how much use it is for you . 
  it basically says that german judges now use sharia law in cases that involve muslims . 
  then it 's okay if we let relgious fanatics add another one , i assume ? 
  if you drive a car or participate in traffic , you know that there is a risk involved . 
  if you start to think that if you go to a concert and there is a risk involved that some dude will execute you and 100 + other people , i see a big problem , which you seem to try to argue away . 
  tell that to the guy , whose head was blown off in a parisian music hall , while some dude shouted allah akbar in his face . 
  [ it 's going on right now ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10716844/islamic-law-is-adopted-by-british-legal-chiefs.html ), 
  you also did n't see an attack on paris until last week ( well , if we ignore the charlie hebdo one ) . 
  or madrid a couple years ago . 
  so everything is fine . 
  no worries . 
  so , an englishman comes to germany , uses the ressources germany has to offer and succeeds ? 
  did you start to despise the german people in the process , because they do n't accomodate to your every wish ? 
  i 'd guess no .
