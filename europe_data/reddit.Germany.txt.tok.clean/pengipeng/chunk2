  you have to get in the hre as fast as possible and team up with austria , when possible bohemia too . 
  after that you can expand to livonia and wait for poland to crumble after some wars . 
  maybe wait for russia to pop up and team up against poland . 
  no , i do n't play this game way too much . / s, 
  when was the point you dismissed all own responsibility and blamed erverything on ze germans ? 
   germany helps russia bypass ukraine via ` nord stream 2 ' does the title seem fair to you , then ? 
  or made with a slight bias in mind ? 
   for comparison that was exactly the way germany tried to pay its war reparations after ww1 nope . 
  all monetary reparations had to be paid in gold ( goldmark ) . 
  the inflation was used to reduce the state debt ( independent from reparations ) , which was in reichsmark ( not backed by gold , anymore ) . 
  and that 's why german politicians think you are a refugee . 
   the marshall plan ( officially the european recovery program , erp ) was an american initiative to aid europe , in which the united states gave $ 13 billion ( ** approximately $ 130 billion in current dollar value as of august 2015 ** ) in economic support to help rebuild european economies after the end of world war ii . 
   the $ 13 billion was in the context of a us gdp of $ 258 billion in 1948  the marshall plan , just as garioa , consisted of aid both in the form of grants and in the form of loans . 
  [ 80 ] out of the total , 1.2 billion usd were loan-aid . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan ) `` ambitious '' germany alone now payed 230 billion to greece . 
   it worked in south korea aswell in japan , too . 
  so , how much did the us pay for iraq by now ? 
  how did that work out in iraq ? 
  how much did the us pay by now ? 
  i believe that is because there is no direct railway between poland and lithuania , which forces you to cross to a non-eu country , which are n't included in the pass . 
   not every job require a work permit . 
  the black market is never negligible . 
  is the zyklon-b production suspiciously increasing ? 
  then it 's probably a bullshit comparison . 
  economic left/right : -1.13 social libertarian/authoritarian : -4.46, 
  i would call them center-right . 
  right wing is more like npd or afd . 
  i 'm always amazed that dutch is still so similar to german that i perfectly understand what you wrote  oh waar kan ik die vinden ? 
  changed it to `` 359 $ ( children get a bit less ) '' also the necessitiy part is based on personal experience as a german . 
  the law my number is based on is called `` asylbewerberleistungsgesetz '' . 
  the translation is something like `` asylum seeker benefits act '' . 
  if you 're an accepted refugee you get hartz4 as every other german , which is 400 $ per month . 
  i 'm not sure why the west should be responsible for their state building . 
  economic help ? 
  sure . 
  but they have this awful habit of fucking everything up that could be called state building . 
  the middle east has n't been a stable place for a long time now . 
  look at poland . 
  my country ( part of the west ) wrecked them big time last century , yet they still were able to have a lawful and stable society , without behadings and suicide bombers every other day . 
  `` i bought your weapons to kill people , now gib germoney ! '', 
  you try to reason logically . 
  that does n't fly with the german left . 
  cdu is right wing ? 
  wtf, 
  wo n't work in germany , at least not in the numbers arriving now . 
  monthly you pay about 120 $ for food in germany . 
  add 30 $ for cleaning stuff ( toothpaste , shampoo , etc. ) . 
  every asylum seekers is entitled to 359 $ ( children get a bit less ) plus housing , electricity , water , medical care per month . 
  they get much more than just necessities . 
   this is not at all what you are experiencing . 
  what you are experiencing is the tired , poor huddled masses coming looking for freedom , safety , and opportunity for their family . 
  [ we had that , too . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migration_period ) it brought down the roman empire , the world superpower of their time . 
   immigration is not the same as colonialism . 
  i 'm saying that colonialism always came with immigration from the colonizing power and pointed to the usa as the best example . 
  [ yeah ... no ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_africans_of_european_ancestry ) . 
  also , ever heard of the usa ? 
  [ the conversation between them right now . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzpv1mf6kgs ), 
   witch [ yeah ] ( http://www.n-joy.de/news_wissen/merkel1502_v-contentgross.jpg ), 
  it depends . 
  if you burn your passport on arrival , you will get between 400 $ to a couple thousand , if your asylum request is nicely faked . 
  considering history `` we 're under siege '' - rhetoric ( north korea ) is a rather poor vehicle for really dangerous political movements . 
  if you want the real deal with 6 mil + gassed people , you need the `` they 're between us '' - rhetoric . 
  this leads to fear , hate and distrust between neighbors . 
  by now i 'm under the impression that basically all fuck ups in all of the middle east and north africa basically try to get into the eu . 
  land in greece , burn papers --  you won the eu lottery, 
  he is n't german , and what he shouted was something like `` why -- germany -- i not go allowed ? '', 
  in the german equivalent . 
  the nazis in germany ( the real ones 70 years ago ) thrived on the rhetoric that `` subversive elements '' were living among the germans ( jews , homosexuals , communists ) and the german people needed to be cleansed to return to former glory . 
  i guess both are interchangeable by now . 
  did austria convert to communism last week ? 
   he report shows that , of 131 individuals charged with the 152 rapes in which the perpetrator could be identified , 45.8 % were of african , middle eastern or asian origin while 54.2 % were of norwegian , other european or american origin . 
  15 % of the population and 45 % of the rape cases in oslo . 
  our news could be called `` slightly '' biased . 
  you know , nazis and all that . 
   traiskirchen that the far right in germany now burns down refugee center with the refugees still inside does n't seem to bother the migrants . 
  they still want to come . 
  he 's british, 
  i 'm wondering if i missed something . 
  did the hot , syrian make-up 'd chick ( was surely unintentional ) actually said why she absolutely needed to go to sweden ? 
  i mean , even from hungary she would have to at least cross germany , austria and denmark . 
  up until it goes to singing the hymns and the british commentator calls the german one `` deutschland , deutschland \u00fcber alles '' http://i.imgur.com/h6mrxj5.png, 
  is n't that the basic property of the british ? 
  like this ww1 , ww2 and 1966 shit when they meet germans . 
  ww1 : we lost against france ( also russia ) ww2 : we lost against soviets and usa 1966 : that is the thing they at least actually won alone . 
  once . 
  in 70 years . 
  whenever they 're involved they seem to have this urge to be the center of attention ... 
  wait a minute . 
  americans are mostly english ... could it be . . ? 
  the battle by leipzig ( german : v\u00f6lkerschlacht bei leipzig , french : bataille des nations ) where a coalition of prussia , austria , russia and sweden finally banished the blue-blobbing baguette empire under napoleon from german soil . 
  it was probably the biggest battle in history until ww1 with more than 600.000 soldiers involved , and in the end 100.000 men on both sides never returning to their homes and families . 
  it marked the end of the french rule in the german states and brought down napoleon with the restoration of the french baguette kingdom . 
  this battle and the overarching `` befreihungskriege '' ( german , wars of liberation ) lead to the first real national identity of the german people and made the unification of the divided german states to one nation in 1871 possible . 
  we also build [ this dank thingy ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b6lkerschlachtdenkmal#/media/file:v%c3%b6lki_fullsize.jpg ) to honor the soldiers , who fought and died for our liberation . 
  why did you lose against argentina last year ?!, 
  final germany vs. swamp-germany would have been fucking awesome . 
  and here we have an american op advertising why europeans have the ( mostly ) unfounded stereotype of stupid americans . 
  while this different kind of secularism may work ( somewhat ) well in india , this is very much intolerable in most european nations .
