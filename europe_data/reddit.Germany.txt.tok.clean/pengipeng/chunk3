  we fought some serious wars between us , because of this stuff . 
  everyone is equal before the law , and all that ... 
  so i hope you understand why many have a very much hostile approach to a religion that still claims to have `` laws of god himself '' in their fairy tale book , while living in the 21 . century . 
   in france , for example , children of muslims that were somewhat integrated in french society were radicalized by wahhabi preaching imams ... 
  i do n't think that will happen to a larger extent . 
  some retards maybe , but we germans have an almost hateful , at least intolerant , stance on public worshiping of whatever religion . 
  pretty much a `` take that shit to your home or church '' thing , if you know what i mean . 
  understandable , as we have a pretty sharp divide between protestants and catholics between north and south . 
  some very big religious wars were thought on german soil , which lead to this stance . 
   if you do n't have the means to help the immigrants ... that 's what i do n't understand . 
  if you 're a german citizen ( or got your asylum granted ) , you 're literally in the luckiest situation in human history . 
  sure , we have poor people , too . 
  but you literally ca n't starve , die of thirst , freeze to death or die of almost all treatable diseases , because all those things are prevented by our generous welfare system . 
  on top of that you get nice pocket money to buy an occasional luxury . 
  why would you believe some retarded imam , that sharia or some shit is better ? 
   this is already happening , but the traditional parties in the west ... do n't get me started . 
  i actually voted center-left all my life , but the shit they bring up here ... spiegel , a pretty left newspaper here , is by now blatant propaganda . 
  faz , zeit , saz , the other big newspaper are at least reasonable . 
  political parties ? 
  they 're pretty much all the same by now . 
  is romania similar ? 
  thanks , but i doubt luck will be enough . 
  the first beheadings in german ikeas or shit like that is pretty much inevitable at this point . 
  even if most of them are normal people , which they are probably , you only need a couple mentally challenged fairy tale worshippers to fuck stuff up . 
  considering that proper german is pretty hard to learn ( even for german kids ) , no , we wo n't be able to bring most of them up to employable levels . 
  there are only a finite amount of windows to wash ... 
  yes , plus housing , medical care and [ some other stuff ... ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/asylbewerberleistungsgesetz#leistungsinhalte ), 
  i guess you 're way better informed than our interior minister then . 
   is germany prepared to quickly organize a system for such a massive amount of people ? 
  probably . 
  germany is pretty rich . 
  throw enough money at it and we 'll handle it . 
   how will germany assimilate islamists in the next decades ? 
  we wo n't . 
   and shariah can only be implemented in a muslim country i think i see a system there . 
  ( just joking ) ^ ^ ^ ^ partially, 
  maybe not sharia law word-for-word as written in their fairy tale book , but you have something called [ muslim personal law sharia application act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_india#law_and_politics ) in civil law , which means you treat muslims different than other religions by law . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  sorry that i might be a dick here and let my european `` nationalism '' out for a bit , but france not that great ? 
  france for a big part `` invented '' western civilisation . 
  and you ca n't live , literally , a day on this planet anymore without using german inventions , from cars to electricity . 
  same for the british . 
  that is the reason why western europe is held in higher regards compared to eastern europe . 
  the `` root cause '' is the fall of the ottoman empire 150 years ago , who conquered and ruled over the whole `` hot '' part which is now the middle east ( also attacked europe lots of times ) . 
  sadly , they are n't around anymore , so now lets blame the west for everything ? 
  you realise that this shit is happening there for a long time now ? 
  with or without western involvement ? 
   a tesla car factory why tesla ? 
  i know tesla is fashionable and `` in '' right now , but we have a `` few '' car companies in europe , too . 
  like , some of the biggest and most advanced ones in the world . 
  why should we invest in an american one ? 
  i guess there was a similar argument for 19 . century colonialism . 
  lets rule africa again !, 
  we just want to give you our money :-(, 
  thank you, 
   yet mr. tovic is tolerated here , . . how generous of them . 
   what , am i now supposed to list your country 's failures , which are neither few nor small ? 
  notice how i did n't comment about being ashamed of other countries citizens . 
   yeah , some of montenegro 's actions regarding refugees are shameful , some , like how it handles the latest immigrant wave , are not . 
  what do you mean with handling ? 
  they act as transit country for western europe . 
  that 's the extent of them `` handling '' the situation . 
   since i am an individual and not a country i am free to have my opinion and ask my questions and claim any moral high horse i want . 
  and i 'm free to point out your emotional bullshit about shame . 
  just wondering , are you over or under 20 years old ? 
  well , if we look at the way montenegro [ handles their refugees ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jun/19/konik-roma-refugee-camp-montenegro ) , you should be very ashamed already . 
  considering that your country absolutely ca n't afford to feed them , and basically treats them like trash , you should maybe refrain from claiming the moral high horse . 
  1 . be `` starving '' and `` poor '' refugee 2 . throw perfectly good food away 3 . 
  : is a fucking line already too complicated for them ? 
  ffs, 
  what about the [ south-sudanese civil war ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_sudanese_civil_war ) 1.8 mil refugees . 
  are n't they legitimate and should n't we take them in ? 
  the [ northern mali conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_mali_conflict ) ? 344.000 refugees ? 
  the [ boko haram insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boko_haram_insurgency ) ? 
  1.000.000 refugees ? 
  [ katanga insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katanga_insurgency ) ? 
  [ adf insurgency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_democratic_forces_insurgency ) ? 
  [ central african republic conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_african_republic_conflict_\\ ( 2012 % e2 % 80 % 93present \\ ) ) ? 
  the [ second libyan civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libyan_civil_war_\\ ( 2014 % e2 % 80 % 93present \\ ) ) ? 
  all the same kind of conflict like in syria . 
  the only legitimacy they lack , compared to syrian refugees , is their will to come to europe , although a lot of them would actually need to cross fewer countries than syrians . 
  take a look at [ this ] ( http://www.bamf.de/shareddocs/anlagen/de/downloads/infothek/statistik/asyl/statistik-anlage-teil-4-aktuelle-zahlen-zu-asyl.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) , page 5 . 
  the chart shows the very fast growing numbers . 
  also add the 20,000 syrians who tried to emigrate over the normal channels just in the first quarter 2015 with growing tendency . 
  we will be very close to that number . 
   the un committee on the elimination of racial discrimination the dutch , one of the most tolerant people on the planet , are the right target for this committee ? 
  really ?!, 
  not , like , most of the non-western world , no !, 
  the dutch ... 
  this is the most sensationalist bullshit i 've read since `` mein kampf '' , just from the other side of the spectrum . 
   in 1940 , at the beginning of world war ii , the fourth international declared : `` the world of decaying capitalism is overcrowded . 
  the question of admitting a hundred extra refugees becomes a major problem for such a world power as the united states . 
  in an era of aviation , telegraph , telephone , radio , and television , travel from country to country is paralyzed by passports and visas . 
  the period of the wasting away of foreign trade and the decline of domestic trade is at the same time the period of the monstrous intensification of chauvinism and especially of anti-semitism . '' http://i.imgur.com/ryh89vx.gifv, 
  that 's just the actual money in cash they get directly handed out to them , no questions asked . 
  you have to add shelter , medical care , administrative costs and the other things i mentioned to that . 
  i 'd guess the total cost should be around 3000 $ -4000 $ for this one family per month . 
  what about the `` untouchable '' castes in india ? 
  what if refugees claim they are one of them ?
