   a poor ** han ** chinese what about tibetan people ? 
  or political prisoners ? 
  can you find out if a chinese refugee is actually in danger of prosecution for political reasons or if they only make it up ? 
  again the complete cost and benefits . 
  asylum seekers live in an assylum processing centre , while refugees do not . 
  as such the second group has also less need for money as a lot is directly provided . 
  - [ source only in german ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/asylbewerberleistungsgesetz#grundleistungen ) they also get cleaning and washing utilitlies , shelter ( heated and with electricity , of cource ) , educational benefits ( mostly for children , but adults too ) , complete medical care and individual special requirements , on top of the cash . 
  if you take a look at the source , you 'll also find a table of the cash payouts required by german law . 
  let 's say a family of 5 , with two parents , a 16 year old , a 12 year old and a 4 year old . 
  they would receive 359 $ ( head of family ) + 323 $ ( partner ) + 283 $ ( 16 year ) + 249 $ ( 12 year ) + 217 $ ( 4 year ) = ** 1431 $ cash and tax free ** . 
  that is more than the median wage in italy , and that 's on top of the other stuff ( shelter , etc. . . ) . 
  i guess , that explains why they all want to come to germany . 
  i 'm sure the russian , chinese or american arms industry would heavily be in favor of taking the burden from us . 
  makes no difference in the end , but at least we can feel superior . 
   serbian and kosovar roma gypsies face discrimination , hunger and they lack basic day-to-day necessities . 
  if that is reason enough to apply for asylum , someone should tell the 200 million indians living in poverty to apply for asylum . 
  and the 150 million chinese . 
  and almost all of sub-saharan africa . 
  and good chuncks of south and middle america . 
  hell , if you take it seriously , you should take in a sizeable portion of the urban black americans . 
  they live in poverty and face discrimination . 
  if we take the 40 % figure for successful applicants in sweden and add them all up that would be what ? 
  300-400 million people ? 
  if someone honestly believes in the legitimacy of that , i would really like to know how the financing plan is going . 
  but hey , i 'm all for it . 
  let 's run some ads in those countries . 
  let them all come to europe . 
  we 'll save the world . 
  the only thing they could do is seasonal work at harvest time and i would even doubt that . 
  i have a bit of experience with moonlighting ( schwarzarbeit ) , and most of them , at least in construction , have actually registered businesses . 
  the only difference is that they 'll not send you a bill , unless they get busted by zoll ( federal police ) . 
  when the state finds out you worked without declaring it , they 'll fuck you , the guys who hired you , and basically everyone involved . 
  and the first thing they 'll do is check your id . 
  that all makes it very hard for illegals to find any kind of actual work ( legal or not ) . 
  so what 'll they do ? 
  drugs , crime , the usual stuff . 
  nice , how an american news site uncovers this `` obsession '' europeans supposedly have about trump . 
  i do n't give a shit about him and i ca n't think of anyone , who sees more in him other than a clown . 
   the 15-year-old , who was described as middle eastern-looking , then ran away . 
  yep, 
  but they 're building a fence , on a border , they want to guard it . 
  no one can get through . 
  they must be racist , or nazis . 
  this is clearly racist somehow . . probably . . 
  i do n't know , someone told me it must be, 
  well , i did n't know it 's still news worthy that a woman is leader of a country , you know , with thatcher and merkel ... 
  but good for them , i guess . 
  it 's the best kind of terrorism . 
  this is totally not gay .

  absolutely . 
  we needed revenge for [ 2002 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_fifa_world_cup#final ) . 
  sweet , sweet revenge . 
  they greatest thing was that ronaldo , who made the two goals in 2002 , was commentator in the stadium when we destroyed them . 
  fun fact : ronaldo also lost his record for shooting most goals in the tournament in the same game ( now miroslav klose , who was also playing against him in the 2002 finale ) . 
  fun fact2 : brasil also lost its record for most total goals in the world cup ( now germany ) . 
  fun fact3 : [ a heat map of the game ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vmxhbfb.png ), 
  `` while an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance , its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger . '', 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradox_of_tolerance ), 
  i guess some people make a nice living from trafficking refugees . 
  a little rumor here and there of the great european riches for asylum seekers and business goes up considerably ... then when they get thrown in little camps with thousands of other refugees and can neither work nor get lots of euromonies thrown after them , some may wake up to harsh reality . 
  but consider that the guy got an iphone . 
  better medical care . 
  work . 
  housing . 
  higher income . 
  safety . 
  free and tolerant society . 
  for middle eastern standards he 's living the high life promised to him , and makes an ad about it .

  i would n't even want that shitstain of a movie for free . 
  considering that wikipedia is a non-profit organisation , i do n't even know what the russians are trying to accomplish here . 
  why should wikipedia care ? 
  [ migration period 2.0 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/migration_period ), 
  does this have anything to do with europe ? 
  i 'm sure they 'll be valuable members of german society . 
   `` where migrants are arriving on inflatable dinghies and small boats from nearby turkey '' is n't turkey a stable and safe country ? 
  that explains a lot , considering that for `` existing '' you already get 400 $ plus rent in germany and ca . 
  200 $ for each child extra , with almost same cost for basic staples . 
  why is that ? 
  they are surely just trying to reach a safe country . 
   it was down to .75 cents per liter wow , that 's expensive . 
  in germany you get a liter for 55 cent . 
  `` freedom \u00a9 and democracy \u2122 '' would be an improvement for all countries in the russian sphere of influence . 
  russians have this awful habit of fucking up countries they ( partially ) rule .

  why ?
