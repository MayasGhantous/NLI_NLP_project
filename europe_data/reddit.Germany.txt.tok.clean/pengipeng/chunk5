  well , that 's not a conspiracy theory , just plain old fascism .

  we have [ siemens ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/siemens#hauptgesch.c3.a4ftsfelder ) . 
  they produce and sell everything we 'd need for nukes . 
  we even have [ uranium deposits ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/uranbergbau#deutschland ) . 
  i would agree with / u/nybbleth , that it would be a matter of months for production and first usable warheads . 
  the only thing stopping us , is political will . 
  i do n't think american high-school students could handle that city xd ( personal opinion , solely based on movies about american high-school students ),

  also you would need proficiency in english , at least . 
  german is somewhat optional , but advantageous , if you want to live here . 
  when i look at your punctuation , you should probably improve your english first , or you will fail ( your choice of words is odd , too ) . 
  you argue in a wierdly one sided way . 
  i could tell you about contribution of my country ( ever heard of von braun ? 
  ) , but you would probably discard it . 
  i could tell you about orion , the new super cool `` american '' spacecraft ... that is for the bigger part build by esa . 
  but you would probably ignore that , too . 
  we also have build rosetta , big part of the iss , ariane , galileo ... 
  but hey , america sent some guys to the moon 40 years ago . 
  nobody cared about the second time anymore . 
  i wonder why ... 
  why do they call it hyper-secret ? 
  is it like dragonball z , with a super secret below that ? 
  is there a ultra-secret ? 
  my experience has actually been rather positive with the machines of deutsche bahn .

  look at some of the american posts about their employers . 
  it seems like they 're at constant war with each other , do n't know why . 
  nice way to put it . 
  it 's not like germany is the save heaven for investors , caused by it 's economic growth and stability ( in contrast to big parts of the eurozone ) .

   the official statistics netherlands said dutch exports to russia were worth 1.26 billion euros ( $ 1.38 billion ) in the first four months of 2015 , a precipitous decline from 2.07 billion euros during the same period a year before . 
  [ dutch trade statistics ] ( http://statline.cbs.nl/statweb/publication/?vw=t&amp;dm=slen&amp;pa=70017eng&amp;la=en ) 2015 jan-apr dutch total exports : 102.2 billion $ i 'm sure our dutch neighbors are already in pure panic mode . 
  wow . 
  he tries pretty hard to stay relevant ... 
  that would be the equal to throwing debtor countries out of the ez . 
  in a couple of months , the northern states would leave and either peg their currencies to germany or join a new `` northern euro '' . 
  the old euro would go down pretty fast , probably . 
   something of male culture could you please define `` male culture '' for me ? 
   they ca n't . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  their economy is crippled by austerity and debt . 
  they can just keep asking for loans to pay back what they owe . 
  it 's a vicious cycle . 
  my point was that ela is not a sufficient leverage , therefore they ca n't cut the debt , yet . 
   read the demand list . 
  they demand basically that they put 50 billion euros of national assets in a fund in luxembourg , so they can be sold without sovereign oversight , to repay debts , apart from gutting labor rights , and ramping up indirect taxes . 
  syriza was the one proposing tax collection reform . 
  creditors just want their money . 
  now . 
  would you lend a country 320 billion + new 84 billion without getting at least something in return ? 
  i 've read the demand list . 
  the demands in order of the article : austerity ( or get your budget in order + payback ) , pension reform ( maybe austerity ) , free marker reforms , free market reforms , free market reforms , responsible governance , free market reforms , free market reforms , cut your last 6 months bullshit , do n't know what was agreed upon then sounds all very reasonable and is standard in most developed nations . 
   the very model of europe is at stake . 
  what is that model , in your opinion ? 
  what the fuck is with this nazi bullshit ?!, 
  the eastern european countries all increased their standard of living very fast since they joined the eu . 
  greece too by the way . 
  [ take a look for yourself ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/table-2-human-development-index-trends-1980-2013 ), 
   nah , the leverage they have is that the ecb is refusing to use the ela to let banks open again and stop the bank run . 
  if they would cut the debt substantially , greece would get fresh money on the market . 
  nothing gets changed and in a couple of years we are in the same situation again . 
   also , these `` reforms '' germany demands are more ideological than rational , as anyone can see they do not address any of greece 's structural problems , but rather insist on selling off national assets and driving down citizens ' income , which can only result in further depression of the economy , leading to lower tax collection and thus , the need for more loans . 
  yeah ... no . 
  they demand the hammer on tax evasion , corruption and some other things . 
  they want the national assets because , you might not noticed yet , greece is in huge debt and not trustworthy as a lender , even less so than a couple of weeks ago . 
  the citizens income was inflated , etc etc etc. 
  you heard the arguments the last weeks . 
   this is more a punishment than a remedy , and an exemplary punishment at that , in case spain or any other of the pigs ( or even france ) get any ideas . 
  yep . 
  there are way more important things to consider than little greece . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage for a reality check, 
  this v-man is comedy gold . 
  reads like propaganda . 
  also , their site is broken . 
   no country can pay a debt totaling 180 % of its gdp yep . 
  it 's also the only leverage the creditors have to demand reforms . 
  do you have a source for this numbers , except varoufakis blog ? 
  he lost quite a lot of credibility , considering he shamelessly lied right in the cameras the last weeks . 
  who thought they had a plan for anything ? 
  if it would solely be based on population , germany would need 14.6 times more votes than finland . 
  currently they have 7.3 times the votes . 
  there is at least a big discrepancy in vote distribution . 
  yeaah ... we tried that [ already ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-debt.png?s=greecegovdeb&amp;d1=20050101&amp;d2=20151231 ) . 
  other sugestions ? 
  what would you propose then ?
