  which would lead to mutual destruction . 
  do n't try . 
  he made up his mind about `` ze evil germans '' some time ago . 
  facts are n't important anymore . 
  they are no real threat to nato . 
  the only leverage they have are nukes . 
  in a conventional war , they would be steamrolled in a couple of months . 
  they can try to bite off little bits of non-eu/non-nato countries , but if they would try something more serious ... 
  they neither have the military nor the economic power for more . 
  agreed . 
  it seems to me , that we would need a strong external pressure to actually get a sense of european unity . 
  that 's how the states got united.germany , too . 
  but that would mean a war , probably , which would be retarded in this day and age . 
  they are so competitive , they threw fucking walmart out of the german market , as they could n't compete with aldi pricing . 
  i think the point he 's trying to make is that germany paid quite a lot for greece over the years ( those are gifts by the way , not loans ) and yet they get painted as aggressor , raping the innocent greeks . 
   schauble will be in a fantastic position to ` manage ' that money for the maximum profit of - surprise surprise - germany . 
  that 's his job . 
   causes a massive fall of cards in the house of cards that is eurozone strongly doubt it . 
  greece is way less important than you think . 
   but hey , herr schauble wants the profits . 
  which is , again , his job . 
   ` naturally ' yep . 
  [ nice read for you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kfw ) kfw is quite literally a branch of german government . 
  so naturally the finance minister of germany is part of the board . 
  further , the german government is the biggest lender to greece . 
  would n't a lender demand some security if they lend something to a not trustworthy debtor ? 
  but please go on . 
  you have an agenda to push ... 
   same , simple course . 
  i think he has his argument switched with reality here . 
  [ eu net payments by country ] ( http://money-go-round.eu/year.aspx?year=0 ) [ greece joined the eurozone in 2001 , go figure ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp.png?s=wgdpgree&amp;d1=19610101&amp;d2=20151231 ) but do n't let facts get in the way of nationalism . 
   because what you call reality , others will call ignorance of economics . 
   it 's important to consider they 've spent most their money in the union , in turn helping make the performance of countries like germany what it is today what kind of twisted logic is that ? 
  `` we bought a lot of stuff from you . 
  now you should give us money ! '', 
  seriously ?!, 
  does that sound logical to you ? 
   so you really need to defined what you mean by living among their means . 
  no problem . 
  [ greece trade deficit ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-balance-of-trade.png?s=gktbale&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) they bought way more shit , than they sold . 
  that is literally the very definition of `` living above their means '' !, 
  now you will probably say `` but , but , germany !!!, 
  it 's mean , that they sell so much nice stuff ! '', 
  [ look at the trade statistics ] ( http://www.investingreece.gov.gr/default.asp?pid=56 ) . 
  greece imports the most stuff from russia and exports almost nothing there . 
  germany is even third biggest importer of greek goods , having a way better record than a lot of other countries . 
  all this `` germany is at fault '' bullshit really gets pathetic by now . 
  and why did the greece debt to gdp remained constant ? 
  their gdp [ doubled ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp.png?s=wgdpgree&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20151231 ) ( ! ), 
  i probably do n't need to cite all the nice gifts the greek government made to public workers in that time and inflating their gdp with it , i hope . 
  all financed by loans . 
  would be nice , if you can refute those numbers i cited here , but i guess you 'll call me ignorant and uneducated , again . 
   etc etc etc etc etc please enlighten me . 
  edit : to make a point of greece helping germany with exports , even if germany stopped exporting to greece altogether , the 4.8 billion we would loose , [ would barely be noticeable . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/exports ) edit2 : i have to correct myself . 
  the first edit compared yearly greek imports with monthly german export . 
  if germany stopped exports to them , [ it would n't even be visible . 
  ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/factsfigures/nationaleconomyenvironment/foreigntrade/tradingpartners/tables/orderrankgermanytradingpartners.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ), 
  i do n't get it . 
  the greeks did not and do not succeed for 15 years now . 
  they just blew their income up with cheap credits and now they need bailout after bailout , either until they live inside their means again or the rest of the union has no money left to spend on them . 
  i 'm sure this `` poor greeks '' rhetoric is nice and gives you fuzzy feelings deep inside , but please cite some numbers , why they should have a higher standard of living than bulgarians or romanians . 
  i do n't see it . 
  edit : nice , please downvote . 
  then you do n't have to face reality . 
  i wrote a comment in another thread , which quite easily explains the whole situation . 
  ( disclaimer : the basic concept is n't my idea , but i wrote this summary . 
  the ifo-institute , direct consultants of the german government , argue in the same way . ), 
  sorry for the wall of text , but it is a bit complex to explain . 
  the problem is the difference between salaries and productivity . 
  if you have high salaries and high productivity ( germany ) , you 're okay . 
  if you have low salaries and high productivity ( i would argue , poland , the baltics and ( maybe ) romania , are in this category ) , your salaries will grow and living standard rises . 
  if you have high salaries and low productivity ( greece ) , you have to take up loans indefinitely ( greece the last years ) or lower you salaries ( and therefore living standard ) . 
  the difference between productivity and salary shows itself in the net trade of a country ( if you have the same currency ) . 
  if two countries have different currencies and one of them has a big trade deficit with the other , the currency of the country with the deficit loses value over time , which effectively lowers salaries and living standard , until the trade deficit is zero again . 
  when both countries have the same currency , the country with lower productivity ( which causes the deficit ) ca n't devaluate . 
  it has to cut its spending and salaries , until they are equal to their productivity again . 
  spending cuts and less income are highly unpopular , as they are very obvious to the population . 
  if your currency loses value ( inflation ) , it 's not so obvious , as your paycheck stays ( nominally ) the same . 
  both methods are effectively the same ( you can buy less stuff ) , but one of them leads to political unrest ( see greece ) . 
  all the wealth and living standard of a nation is determined by their productivity . 
  low productivity -  poor country high productivity -  rich country greece took up loans to increase its living standard , without increasing its productivity ( do you know any valuable products that are produced in greece ? 
  olive oil , maybe ( a bit hyperbole , i know ) ) . 
  germany produces lots of valuable stuff other people want to buy , which leads to a higher standard of living . 
  the net trade of both countries with the rest of the world shows it quite nicely . 
  [ greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-balance-of-trade.png?s=gktbale&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) as a huge deficit , as their productivity is low . 
  [ germany ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-balance-of-trade.png?s=grtbale&amp;d1=19500101&amp;d2=20151231 ) has a huge surplus , as their productivity is high . 
  even higher then their already high salaries . 
  all the problem we have right now in the eurozone , are caused by this differences in productivity . 
  both situations in the respective countries are not sustainable , as a trade surplus leads to bad relations to other countries , and a deficit leads to a fucked up country in the long run ( the german nazis came to power , because of a very similar situation in germany in the 1920-30 ) . 
  the sad thing is , that in this constellation , the german workers get also fucked , although way less then the greek workers . 
  the german salaries ( and standard of living ) should be way higher to catch up with their productivity . 
  the greek workers salaries should be lower , but unions and the workers ( understandably ) ca n't accept that . 
  so the unemployment goes up to unsustainable levels . 
  this causes riots , hate and extremist parties get voted into government . 
  the conclusion is that a `` grexit '' is sadly the best of the terrible options we have . 
  edit : any opinions on my conclusion ? 
   but germany 's reasons for being in the euro are beyond my understanding we can thank the french ... '' ... , in late 1989 france extracted german commitment to the monetary union in return for support for german reunification . '', 
  [ src ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_euro#relaunch ) they demanded german commitment to a monetary union to have better control over a reunified , and considerably larger , germany , else they would have blocked reunification . 
  understandable , if we consider history .
