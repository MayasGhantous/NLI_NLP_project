  i 'm no historian , either . 
  what i know is , greece fucked up the last 2 decades . 
  does that guy actually have sources for the stuff he writes about ? 
  i could n't see any . 
  in the year 2001 greece was aloud to join the euro . 
  this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move . 
  what followed was the biggest [ growth spurt ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp.png?s=wgdpgree&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20151231 ) in recent greek history . 
  at the same time , the government spent [ more and more ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-spending.png?s=greecegovspe&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) , and , despite all that growth , still ran a huge and consistent [ deficit ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-budget-value.png?s=greecegovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) in their spending . 
  their average was around 6 billion $ in quarterly deficit from 2001 to 2008 ( and that were the good times ) . 
  greece actually built a fragile house of cards , financed by the low interest rates before the crisis . 
  [ look ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-bond-yield.png?s=gggb10yr&amp;d1=19980101&amp;d2=20151231 ) at the interest they paid on 10 year bond . 
  do you see them going down 2001 ? 
  they came down from rates of 10-15 % before the euro . 
  now they have german level of credit , as most banks thought , germanys government is de-facto lender of last resort . 
  so , what do the greeks do with this platinum credit ? 
  they spent , and that in the stupidest way possible , for consumption . 
  average retirement age for public workers : 56 ( 15.6.2015 ) . 
  military spending , laughably high salaries for public workers , lots of useless and unproductive government jobs , tax evasion ( yes , you effectively pay for tax evasion by lost taxes ) . 
  and all that with a productive basis , that is at best thin . 
  but their gdp blows up like an airbag . 
  lots of money in greek hands to spend on stuff . 
  for the big part loans , but what do they care . 
  their trade deficit [ blows up ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-balance-of-trade.png?s=gktbale&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) . 
  tl ; dr : they lived on credit for a long time and bought a lot of nice stuff . 
  now they ca n't pay the bill . 
   history can still provide us with examples of what worked or what did n't in somewhat similar situation that is a good point . 
  let 's look at history in the year 2001 greece was aloud to join the euro . 
  this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move . 
  what followed was the biggest [ growth spurt ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp.png?s=wgdpgree&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20151231 ) in recent greek history . 
  at the same time , the government spent [ more and more ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-spending.png?s=greecegovspe&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) , and , despite all that growth , still ran a huge and consistent [ deficit ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-budget-value.png?s=greecegovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) in their spending . 
  their average was around 6 billion $ in quarterly deficit from 2001 to 2008 ( and that were the good times ) . 
  compare that to [ germany ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-government-budget-value.png?s=germanygovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) ( keep in mind , germany has 16 ( ! ), 
  times the gdp , 8 times the poulation , way higher gdp per capita , lots of industry ) , which averaged about 10 billion $ in quartely deficit . 
  compare that to [ france ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/france-government-budget-value.png?s=francegovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20081231&amp;type=column ) ( 12 times gdp , 6 times population , lots of industry , most visited tourist country ) , which averaged about 38 billion $ in quarterly deficit . 
  coompare that to [ australia ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/australia-government-budget-value.png?s=australiagovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20081231&amp;type=column ) ( 6.5 times gdp , 2.3 times population , lots of ressources , industries ) , which averaged a slight surplus of ca . 
  300 million $ aud . 
  compare that to [ spain ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-government-budget-value.png?s=spaingovbudval&amp;d1=20030101&amp;d2=20081231&amp;type=column ) ( 6 times gdp , 4 times population , big agriculture , some industry , tourists ) , which averaged to 5 billion $ in quarterly deficit . 
  compare ** that ** to greece : 354 billion gdp ( 2008 ) , 11 million people , one varoufuckthis . 
  these are all numbers from 2001-2008 , except germany ( til 2014 ) and spain ( from 2003 ) . 
  so , history told us greece spent a fuckton of money . 
  now some `` experts '' tell us greece should spend more money . 
  worked great the last time , i guess ? 
  edit : would somebody like to bring up arguments or just downvotes ? 
  almost all of the european leaders are now ok with a grexit . 
  the sympathy for greece in the european population got down significantly . 
  syrizas first actions in government were recalling of reforms . 
  i do n't quite get it , how you think , that others think syriza should have `` rescued greece from 40 years of mis-management '' . 
  you realize syriza acted like huge dicks since they were voted , do n't you ? 
  and thats it . 
  no one wants to work with them anymore . 
  you wrote :  international politics and interpersonal relations are much , much different . 
  i wrote :  it 's almost like international politics are way closer to interpersonal relations , then one ( namely you ) would think . 
  you wrote :  so because they have one thing in common , they have everything in common ? 
  how do your and my comment , lead to that conclusion ? 
   teenagers man , they 'll die before they accept fault . 
  do n't know , man , have n't spoken to one in two years . 
   all i 'm asking is for you to give what others say a chance before assuming the worst and then acting as if the other is mentally retarded just because it does n't agree with everything you say . 
  i do . 
  then you had the decency to call me stupid . 
  then you called me a teenager . 
  seriously , do you see what is wrong with your sentence ? 
  and at last . 
  if i thought you 're mentally retarded , i would n't argue with you . 
  i would say `` good point !, 
  here , have a cookie '' and thats the end of it . 
  very nice , that you use 2007 as beginning . 
  then you do n't have to explain , [ how their budget blew up ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-spending.png?s=greecegovspe&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) in the years before that . 
  i wrote a pretty long comment , trying to explain the thing from a germans point of . 
  might be useful so here it is . 
  i 'm not sure , if you know what a mess the hellenic republic is . 
  i 'll try to explain . 
  i would really hope you read it as it might help you to understand why another debt cut is so hated by europeans .

  these are all numbers from 2001-2008 , except germany ( til 2014 ) and spain ( from 2003 ) . 
  but then we had this inconvient crisis coming around , [ and ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/spain-government-budget-value.png?s=spaingovbudval&amp;d1=20030101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) [ it ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/australia-government-budget-value.png?s=australiagovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) [ hit ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/ireland-gdp.png?s=wgdpirel&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) [ hard ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/romania-government-budget-value.png?s=romaniagovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) as laid out above , greece spent lots and lots of other peoples money , even in the good times . 
  but now come the bad times . 
  as the crisis hit , everyone is in panic mode . 
  huge amount of bailout money get pumped in the banks . 
  and as soon as the smoke lighted up a bit , many eurozone countries , and lots of non-eurozone countries , had problems to pay their bills . 
  but , as we are a union , we help our members in need . 
  so we started to create help mechanisms ( efsf , efsm , etc. ) . 
  these help mechanism are constructed as loans and backed by the huge economic power of the european union , with interest rates way lower then normal market rates and running times which can be extended at will ( factually a debt haircut financed by the less hard hit countries ) . 
  one after another , the hardest hit countries apply for help ( greece , ireland , spain , portugal ) and get loans in the billions to help their economy . 
  in turn they have to agree to cut government spending and reduce their deficit . 
  years go by and most countries are at least stable or actually growing again ( ireland grows again , spain too , portugal is stable ) but what is with greece ? 
  greece actually built a fragile house of cards , financed by the low interest rates before the crisis . 
  [ look ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-bond-yield.png?s=gggb10yr&amp;d1=19980101&amp;d2=20151231 ) at the interest they paid on 10 year bond . 
  do you see them going down 2001 ? 
  they came down from rates of 10-15 % before the euro .
