  this is german level of credit , as most banks thought , germanys government is de-facto lender of last resort . 
  so , what do the greeks do with this platinum credit ? 
  they spent , and that in the stupidest way possible , for consumption . 
  average retirement age for public workers : 56 ( 15.6.2015 ) . 
  military spending , laughably high salaries for public workers , lots of useless and unproductive government jobs , tax evasion ( yes , you effectively pay for tax evasion by lost taxes ) . 
  and all that with a productive basis , that is at best thin . 
  but their gdp blows up like an airbag . 
  lots of money in greek hands to spend on stuff . 
  for the big part loans , but what do they care . 
  their trade deficit [ blows up ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-balance-of-trade.png?s=gktbale&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) . 
  they produce a bit , but spend a lot . 
  the crisis comes around and their house of cards falls . 
  they get bailed out . 
  private creditors take a 50 % loss , but can finally walk away . 
  efsf , iwf , ecb pump more and more money into greece and demand austerity , to get their huge public sector down to sustainable levels . 
  as the public sector is cut , all the unproductive public workers loose their jobs and salaries . 
  gdp contracts 25 % ( not much , if you consider the party they had before ) . 
  european countries send more loans ( i repeat , with rates the greeks could n't even dream to get on the free market ) . 
  fucking eastern european countries , way poorer then greece , take up loans to help them . 
  eu now owns 75 % of greek debt . 
  greeks start crying : `` austerity is bad !, 
  it does n't work ! '', 
  riiiiight . 
  greek gdp finally [ grows again ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) . 
  unemployment goes [ down ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-unemployment-rate.png?s=umrtgr&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) debt stays [ somewhat stable . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-debt-to-gdp.png?s=grcdebt2gdp&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) they demand ( sic ! ), 
  more money . 
  samaras is thrown out of government . 
  tsipras , a communist , is voted in . 
  he calls varoufakis as finance minister . 
  first actions are recall of past reforms . 
  thousand of public workers get hired again , after samaras fired them . 
  varoufakis plays his games . 
  tsipras demands ( sic ! ), 
  better terms with the creditors . 
  they disagree . 
  greece walks out of negotiations with creditors . 
  tsipras does n't know what to do . 
  varoufakis wants to play a game . 
  they call for a referendum , where they ask , if the last proposal of the creditors should be accepted ( i guess ??? ) . 
  they probably hope for a yes , so they can quit as government . 
  they people vote no . 
  many sad faces . 
  greece has a party , says fuck you to rest of europe . 
  creditors are pissed . 
  varoufakis rage quits . 
  and here we are now . 
  and after all that , we now should at first forgive their debt ? 
  let 's compare the whole thing with ireland . 
  crisis hits . 
  ireland is in big financial problems . 
  ireland applies for help from iwf and eu . 
  ireland gets 67 billion $ euro . 
  agrees to austerity . 
  ireland cuts spending . 
  ireland grows 4.8 % in 2014 . 
   empathy has many uses in politics , pr being the most obvious one my point exactly . 
  it 's almost like international politics are way closer to interpersonal relations , then one ( namely you ) would think . 
   anyway , i 'm not sure if you 're overestimating your understanding or underestimating others ' but you really should stop . 
  that 's the nicest way to call someone stupid , that i 've seen in a long time . 
  therefore < 3 and fuck you , too, 
  you do n't like facts then i presume ? 
   ca n't wait to be involved in world war iii ten years down the road , when europe has failed and we 're all at each other 's throats again ahhhh , but fear , feear . 
  that 's is an argument you like . 
  if they do n't love us , they should atleast fear us ( or the consequences , if they do n't agree to our terms ) . 
   this kind of shit post is exactly what i mean . 
  considering that he posted links with facts and your comment consisted only of emotion , hyberbole and bullshit , i 'm sure , you 're very much entitled to that opinion . 
   international politics and interpersonal relations are much , much different . 
  is n't that convenient , when it suits you . 
  a couple of comments further up , you talk in favor of empathy in economic decisions . 
  sounds sliiightly interpersonal to me , but hey , if it helps your argument ... 
  if the greeks ca n't even take responsibility for their own financial decisions , we should treat them accordingly . 
  please do . 
  they wanted to join , after the rules were written . 
  and if anyone would allow greek contributions to the rule book , [ we would have 30 % inflation right now ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-inflation-cpi.png?s=gkcpnewy&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20151231 ) . 
  thanks and please do . 
  took me way too long to write that all down and no one seeing it . 
  the money is with 80 % owed to other european nations and the imf ... has been like that for years now . 
  i assume [ this ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth-annual.png?s=gkgnvyy&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231 ) improvement over a couple of years is also just movement around a trendline for you . 
  and that the crisis is `` going crescendo '' is the fault of whom , exacly ? 
  yes , i did . 
  true , but the cut was significant , even if that chart exaggerates it . 
  edit : i wrote something factually wrong here . 
  please move on , citizen . 
  after going [ up , up , up ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-spending.png?s=greecegovspe&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) . 
  syriza was voted in january 2015 . 
  [ gdp growth greece ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) . 
  second column from the right is first quarter 2015 . 
  [ trendline since bailout and austerity are implemented ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp-growth.png?s=gkgnvqq&amp;d1=20100101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;trend=1 ), 
  i 'm not sure , if you know what a mess the hellenic republic is . 
  i 'll try to explain . 
  i would really hope you read it as it might help you to understand why another debt cut is so hated by europeans . 
  in the year 2001 greece was aloud to join the euro . 
  this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move . 
  what followed was the biggest [ growth spurt ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-gdp.png?s=wgdpgree&amp;d1=19600101&amp;d2=20151231 ) in recent greek history . 
  at the same time , the government spent [ more and more ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-spending.png?s=greecegovspe&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) , and , despite all that growth , still ran a huge and consistent [ deficit ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-government-budget-value.png?s=greecegovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) in their spending . 
  their average was around 6 billion $ in quarterly deficit from 2001 to 2008 ( and that were the good times ) . 
  compare that to [ germany ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/germany-government-budget-value.png?s=germanygovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20151231&amp;type=column ) ( keep in mind , germany has 16 ( ! ), 
  times the gdp , 8 times the poulation , way higher gdp per capita , lots of industry ) , which averaged about 10 billion $ in quartely deficit . 
  compare that to [ france ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/france-government-budget-value.png?s=francegovbudval&amp;d1=20010101&amp;d2=20081231&amp;type=column ) ( 12 times gdp , 6 times population , lots of industry , most visited tourist country ) , which averaged about 38 billion $ in quarterly deficit .
