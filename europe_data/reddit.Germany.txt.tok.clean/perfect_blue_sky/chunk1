let \u00b4 s hope it \u00b4 s just that , 
  : cars :, 
  but with a little bit of money you can probabely get anywhere in these countries . 
  those numbers simply can \u00b4 t be trusted . 
  they come from public televion wich is mainly controlled by spd and cdu politicans . 
  those parties that are responsible for the refugee chaos in germany . 
  from a super xenophobic headline to an understandable prevention measure in 1 sec . 
  thanks, 
  this is just the guy who has to carry out the shit politicans decide . 
  to me it looks he \u00b4 s leaving the sinking ship . 
  well that \u00b4 s what democracy is all about . 
  look at switzerland it works out pretty well for them . 
  especially the eastern european countries should know that what it means when one or a few person think they do the best for their country without any legitimation from the people . 
  so let me get this straight , serbian police was there watching syrians throwing rocks over the hungarian boarder but didn \u00b4 t intervene because first : they were sysrians , not serbianas and second : it was no thread to the serbians . 
  yeah makes perfect sense . 
  what an utter nonsense . 
  i \u00b4 ve seen the live coverage yesterday for several hours . 
  it was not like there were thousend of people in a dense crowd that you couldn \u00b4 t have escaped . 
  also the situation didn \u00b4 t explode in seconds . 
  i heated up over hours and maybe even days . 
  it \u00b4 s absolutely irresponsible to have children there . 
  but our media is glad they can show pictures of cute crying children . 
  it fits perfectly into the whole propaganda battle that \u00b4 s going on right now . 
  the media also reported that hungary let \u00b4 s refugees in , but only in small groups and everyone has to be registered . 
  that \u00b4 s what they don \u00b4 t want . 
  what they want is going straight into germany . 
  actually orban does exactly what the contracts demand . 
  protect the eu boarder and register every refugee on arrival in the country they arrive in . 
  but fortunately the orban bashing will come to an end very soon . 
  slovenia is the next country to face exactly the same problem . 
  let \u00b4 s see how an even smaller counry like slovenia can handle these masses . 
  who is so stupid to place children in a heated situation like this directly in front of the boarder ? 
  and where were the serbians ? 
  now they complain about hungary but those refugees were on their territory . 
  thank you hungary !, 
  not really , but this might be interesting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_and_crime, 
  looks like they changed their mind pretty quickly . 
  according to the `` spiegel '' they will let them pass . 
  for the moment mostly women and children . 
  zoran milanovic states : `` they will be allowed to cross the country and we will help them '' so next stop slovenia . 
  i wonder what they will do . 
  if they also just let them pass to the austrian boarder austria will be in the same position as hungary was over the last weeks . 
  let \u00b4 s see if they can handle things better than hungary after austria and germany bashed orban pretty hard ,, 
  remember those teenage girls that created an event on facebook for their birthday party and accidently made it public ? 
  hundreds would come and the police had to show up to get everything under control . 
  yeah . . it was that kind of invitation . 
  so what did they do with the boats until now ? 
  yeah , but putting people onto trains and deporting them into camps in germany is totaly 21st century / ironie off, 
  it \u00b4 s incredible what happen here in germany over the last weeks . 
  i \u00b4 ve never seen people getting so brainwashed by the mainstream media . 
  or maybe the shall i say the mainstream media tried . 
  it was almost like , if you weren \u00b4 t cheering for refugees you would be labeled a nazi . 
  one could say free speech was suspressed . 
  comments for pro refugee articles were disabled on most online portals of the main press houses . 
  new words and phrases were invented . 
  `` neue deutsche wilkommenskultur '' ( new german welcoming culture ) . 
  they made a `` great refugee gala '' in the public broadcasting were ray garvey would sing `` super girl '' for a refugee girl . 
  i \u00b4 m just waiting for the refugee song . 
  wag the dog style . 
  they tell us , the world loves us for our refugee politics , while i read the exact opposite on foreign news sites . 
  especially the comments . 
  official polls say the majority of germans agree with our current refugee politics . 
  the poll was taken offline very quickly so all i got is a screenshot from a not very reliable source . 
  but i \u00b4 ve seen that poll myself while it was online . 
  http://info.kopp-verlag.de/data/image/peter%20harth/2015-05/umfrage%20945%20prozent/aufzeichnen.jpg ( i \u00b4 m not a fan of kopp verlag at all , but they are the last who seem to have this information online ) we \u00b4 re beeing brainwashed so hard one could start believing in conspiracy theories . 
  i mean merkel can \u00b4 t be that ignorant , or can she ? 
  fortunately in the last 2-3 days the wind started turning a bit and the media starts to wake up from their propaganda-orgy . 
  the first critical articles appear and we have a huge hangover . 
  but i think it \u00b4 s way to late . 
  we fucked it up , again . 
  those stupid words she said about there is `` no limit we will take refugees '' and `` the boarders will stay open '' . 
  probabely as we speak ten thousends are on their journey to europe only because of this stupidity . 
  hundreds will die as we have seen it in the past and merkel is directly responsible . 
  i also wonder how we think to get these people through the winter . 
  in the area i live , they are currently building 3 tent camps . 
  it \u00b4 s mid september now and the media is reporting those tents are not made for winter and container are unavailable for the next month . 
  now they are allready talking about confiscating unused property . 
   why are these special services needed on the net ? 
  the internet is multifaceted , and creates services that nobody could have imagined until recently . 
  from video conferences , online gaming ... 
  astro turfing is a common instrument by public opinion agencies to shape opinions nowadays . 
  especially huge companies and industries use it for their interests . 
  i predict  in a few hours the up and down votes in this thread will have reversed and the people against it will gain the upper hand . 
  this is because reddit is huge compared to the ressources of a public opinion agency . 
  the cepr study uses cpe, 
  no it \u00b4 s the summary of all models used . 
  than you didn \u00b4 t read carefully . 
  to break it down . 
  both say those positive effects are stretched over a timeframe where they become marginal , not even taking the costs of ttip into account . 
  sure i did . 
  one the first look it looks great but if you look a bit closer you will notice these studies can \u00b4 t really hold what they promise . 
  actually they don \u00b4 t promise that much anyway if you read them carefully as this right wing german newspaper did . 
  http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2014-11/ttip-freihandelsabkommen-arbeitsplaetze as well as the more left wing `` friedrich ebert stiftung '' did http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id/ipa/11050.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_ebert_foundation btw . 
  our commerce secretery sigmar gabriel who is absolutely pro ttip is from the spd in case you question the fes wich is affiliated with the spd . 
  not all of the negotiators are `` dwarfs '' as you calls them like vietnam . 
  it also involves big players like australia and japan . 
  so it could be questioned the eu is a heavier weight . 
  the article i linked states that 11 important points like copyright , drm , liability of providers are basically 100 % copies of us law . 
  those agreements are simply the big mother of all those rejected agreements we had in the past , like acta . 
  this time it \u00b4 s made , to big to fail .
