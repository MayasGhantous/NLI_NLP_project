  tricky germans we are , secured influence we have , hide behind others we did . 
  as a german : sorry europe for politician disposal, 
  google `` europe of regions '' many came up with this idea before . 
  and yes its just a logic development and will most likely happen . 
  pretty much sold all aks and migs form gdr a long time ago ... 
  it 's germany . 
  we got our own industrial military complex , although we primarily dell stuff to others . 
  what possible event could be stopped by us troops that could n't be stopped by european ones and is not fatal to the whole as in ww3 ? 
  well we do probably have the most influence . 
  i think is kind of primus inter pares . 
  there wo n't be much descisions against the will of germany . 
  i think because anyone prefers germany to be the political stable paymaster . 
  germany is very often called `` the reluctant leader '' , which describes it pretty good btw . 
  a germany in depression , with unstable gouvernments ( no , i mean democratic , but with a thin margin ) could ruin first the euro , afterwards the eu . 
  no the ecb is actually much less controllable by germany than any other institution ( thats why draghi continuous to decide thinks merkel doesn \u00b4 t like ) . 
  but ger pays the most on any bail-out fonds , the most for any eu institutions . 
  seems to make sense then - give equip , buy gas , send gas back to ukraine . 
  i don \u00b4 t know where all that panic is coming from ? 
  you know that invading poland or the baltics is declaring war on 28 countries ? 
  what would be the intent to declare war on them ? 
  what motives ? 
  and what would be there to gain ? 
  only reason there is would be being a sociopathic dictator . 
  putin is not a sociopath , nor a 100 % dictator ( he has to be weary of his own peoples opinion ) . 
  so what do you think would happen ? 
  army would be mobilized and all european countries would go to war ... all ... on polish soil ... to defend it . 
  what could a mere +1 or 2 divisions stationed change then ? 
  nothing . 
  so why move them there ? 
  the moment a russian force would even try to occupy central/east europe , the russian country would collapse , soldiers would desert , europeans would suddenly get into a very suprising `` armageddon-mode '' and go full guerilla warfare ( that would be funny - imagine no more internet , blackouts , softdrink and alcohol-shortages , no new company car , 80 % of companies would just shut down ) , because theres not much to do , and why live anyway without all the 1st world substitutions for meaning ? 
  so this just won \u00b4 t happen ... and if it would , we have a full-blown ww3 - which actually wouldn \u00b4 t stop at a polish border and you wouldn \u00b4 t have to worry anyhow . 
  most of it already leaked . 
  and honestly ... not much advantages besides lighting norms in cars . 
  ahem ... lobbyists are right now the only persons actively seeing and influencing it . 
  from pharma to automobile has made its proposals behindert closed doors . 
  its actually from thailand . 
  its a copycat . 
  i see thats where the downvotes for facts come from ... but id really like to understand this sentiment and most of the things he said where alse true i suppose . 
  but building a eu federation means foremost building a eu public and an understanding . 
  uuuh ... 2.6 billions 2000-2006 . 
  you can read this : https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=a6xwu8xcoi3t4qsjq4hqcg&amp;url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1421.pdf&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0ccoqfjag&amp;usg=afqjcng_tmigr3gem_ynwxso1tjbtkoq4q, 
  seriously how many projects do you have a round financed by the european union having a big shield put up in front of them showing that the european fund financed this ? 
  i always wonder how people say they do n't recognize what the eu brought to their country . 
  its not a `` dont use them '' decision . 
  if we allow them to run the existing structure goes south ... just by ignoring the rules that apply to their competitors . 
  wont happen . 
  independent contractors is bascially saying `` ruin the employee infrastructure '' - maybe we germans are too much socialist for you guys same as with coverage - and taxation ( of a `` fake '' self-employed guy - state looses all social insurance ) . 
  nah - i might curse them from time2time , but i want reliable , accessible taxi services . 
  yeah well in germany it disrupts a lot of things we do n't want disrupted : - insurance for passengers ( by law ) - minimum wage ( just introduced ) - taxing revenue of drivers ( ... ) - any vehicle-requirements for passenger-transportation - nightly coverage/rural coverage of transport-service this is not a disruption - this just violates reasonable laws - and a lot of them . 
  rotterdam is much better then its reputation . 
  only remaining question is `` french franc '' = lira or mark ? 
  that 's an old idea - it finally comes down to a `` north-euro '' ( thecurrencyformerlyknownas `` deutsche mark '' ) and a `` south-euro '' ( thecurrencyformerlyknownas `` italian lira '' ) ... 
  yes it 's hilarious - although becoming a monopol-style gatekeep is something to be observed . 
  i did n't want to take sides there - just wanted to hint to the fact that this is not something `` germany-exclusive '' . 
  to be fair : - google streetview had the obligation to `` blank '' views by request of owners - after too many wanted to do so , google just stopped . 
  - the `` google news has to pay '' debate is worldwide , at least europe-wide - the fact that apple , facebook and google violate privacy laws to some extend is a fact that has to be adressed - uber is actually just an asshole company , and they do violate a ton of laws - this is not `` the glorious digital industry disrupts '' , this is `` the asshole company makes money by violating laws '' . 
  airbnb is close to that ( think taxes ... ), 
  because the uk has no contribution-based system , as anyone else . 
  therefore they keep infringing with the basic rule : any eu-citizen has to be treated the same as a national . 
  i guess a dutch would not get anything if he never paid into it ( besides social welfare ... which can be denied on that principle ) . 
  so basically they should just reform their fuckedup system and everything is fine . 
  basically 80 % of people asking questions like '' how is it a bad thing , that ... '' are paid to do this . 
  holy shit ... do you have too much time ? 
  what a wall of text . 
  just one thing : this all comes from the idea that investors are `` rational '' - they 're not . 
  if one gorilla retreats some of them tend to follow the gorilla . 
  occupy anything is not a gorilla ... it 's not even a flea . 
  corn - i 'm with you on that ... but has not much to do with retreating from invest . 
  minimum wage - nope wo n't follow you there . 
  because automation will happen anyway ( not because wage ... but because workers rights and hours ) . 
  all this does n't say that there are more effective ways to promote green energy . 
  to be fair , although we disagree on this - at least your arguments are based on sources and make for a sound discussion . 
  somone is shadowbanned here ... it says 3 comments - but only 2 visible, 
  sure ... but the very idea of these kinds of agreement was to protect from a probably unstable justice systems ... in case of 2nd/3rd world countries . 
  it was n't meant as a blue-print for sueing anything anytime just because you can . 
  although it 's nafta i especially like this one : http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/01/13/canada_being_sued_for_billions_under_nafta_investor_protections.html you want to build a new bridge ? 
  no way - costs you billions , because i have the right to have a monopoly ... noone intended to have something like this . 
  in 35 years the difference between the nation of france and the nation of germany is probably ... none , because it 's just europe . 
  this is ( and i frankly do not understand that the tpp is the only one discussed in the us ) by far bigger then the tpp . 
  in sheer volume - in `` parity of forces '' , in lawsuits that would follow . 
  to give you some hardly avoidable scenarios : parma region sues the hell out of several us food manufacturers for producing `` parma '' - ham , cheese , etc. 
  monsanto tries to sue the hell out of several european countries for blocking gmos tobacco companys suing the hell out of ireland ( ups ... already happening ) investment bankers suing the hell out of each other ... and now for some good things : automotive indutry can standardize certifications of turn signal indicators on cars ... ... . . 
  ... wondering where the downvotes come from ? 
  that might be the case if i personally do not invest 5k $ in coal stocks . 
  but it is definitley a signal when the largest fund in the world says so . 
  someone has to make the first step ... and if it 's the largest shoe available that does , it probably has an impact . 
  hey those mallorca , ibiza , menorca thingies are basically german !, 
  i would rate not-responding to distress-calls , pushing back boats that are close to sinking or shooting at boats at least second grade murder ... international law pretty much says so too . 
  if you think it through , the idea of an immigration centre and a ferry line would probably be a better idea ( you could basically decline a lot of them much faster - even easier then returning them ) . 
  and one way or the other we have to solve syria ... 
  some of them because we ( as in europeans ) did fuck them up before . 
  from colonization to corporate influence to killing their home idustry with our subsidied products . 
  i always thought the old idea of settling people where noone wants to live a good one ( rural areas with declining populations ) - but this does not work at those scales . 
  so probably the last one ... because the others are either murder or not-feasible . 
  if you want to have an understanding of minorities in germany you should watch at least the following : [ head-on ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347048/ ) [ die fremde ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288376/ ) and for a special experience this one : [ combat girls ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1890373 ), 
  no problem there - what do i care who 's second or third ... :p, 
  he should have known this before . 
  if he wanted to test the water why not sending a minor guy forward ? 
  but this way it 's just incompetence . 
  lol ... he just made a 180degree to that minutes ago .
