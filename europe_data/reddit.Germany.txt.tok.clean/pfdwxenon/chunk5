  anyway - in your case i would advice to leave , if those are the opinions you hold . 
  it is very very easy . 
  if you support the idea of an `` ever closer union '' , which will finally result in some sort of federal state - stay . 
  if not - leave . 
  if it 's only because `` free trade '' let 's agree on a tracta ( transcanaltradeagreement ), 
  on a side note : most stduies performed to proof the lack of qualified workers define `` lack '' as `` less then 4 people applying for 1 job '' ... 
  that 's the real problem ... what the hell do the tories actually want ? 
  cameron was indifferent to that question for all the times he just ranted against something, 
  how about : `` if the uk get a opt-out at free movement i will singely protest them all day long to gtfo '', 
  what 's a `` good bank '' ? 
  seems a contradiction in itself ... 
  anyway - go for the bigger ones , should have a vaster network . 
  can we all collect the best dacia-ads out there for each country ? 
  : for germany it 's probably this one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gah04jkziw, 
  we ca n't french anymore ... strike abandoned after less then 24hrs :-(, 
  we can french too !, 
  dont tell the germans, 
  it is a good analysis , but some of it is quite biased . 
  again : it might be sch\u00e4uble 's idea ( as in medicine ) , but it 's not him to decide , and other countries find the same medicine a proper solution . 
  trust : ... all proposals come up with `` pour money into the system - it will heal '' . 
  without `` healing '' the greek institutional infrastructure ( tax , land registery , nepotism , tax evasion , red-tape founding procedures , etc. ), 
  the money ( or a good part of it ) would porbably go the same way it did before - vanish or leave the country . 
  one idea that might be a funny one : why not offload the 5 major banks to the [ srm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_resolution_mechanism ) . 
  thx - stumbled upon that figure too and wondered ... 
  wait if she dares to not give away the keywordlist . 
  or if she does and its a hellhole of economic espionage . 
  polls will change then . 
  didnt say its perfect , just much better then denouncing citizenship ( which is impossible either way ) . 
  any better solutions ? 
  i mean at the end you could them prosecute infinitely for destabilizing the state . 
  there are enough options to deal with them based on law - they did support a terrorist group , makes them easily valid for 6-8yrs jail . 
  this is going to be interesting . 
  it 's one of the few times she could get challenged . 
  she very much rules on the base of opuinion polls - if this changes ( it would change if they would not publish the keywords that have been searched ) she has to act ... something she does not very good . 
  obviously i was misunderstood - this statement was meant to underline the fact that the race has little to do with being a cunt ... 
  try to beat this one - and yes it 's technicaly correct : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68vbd0gcsxk and yes we could go on infintely, 
  those words come almost natural ... brown ... dresden ... 
  au contraire . 
  hamburg is posh . 
  everyone has to wear some obscure regional brand to show he/she is special and of course a true hamburger deern . 
  more like industry hubs . 
  at least thats the case for germany . 
  this guy alone has some 30.000 by himself : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reinhold_w%c3%bcrth, 
  might not be anyone around till then . 
  radiation most likely killed anything before . 
  yeah but london might not be in europe that much longer ;-), 
  obviously ... and therefore the timing just after they can rule alone now . 
  it also is obviously cheaper to just lobby cameron then lobby him and several european instititions . 
  last time i visited berlin it was as always : a constant race to the bottom . 
  but on the other hand : that 's why i like berlin - noone gives a shit . 
  this is exactly why germany will abolish nuclear power - humans ca n't be trusted ... 
  let me translate this for you : `` minimize bureaucracy '' = `` get rid of all workers rights , environmental restrictions , and basically go full neo-lib retard '', 
  this is so much a copy , & paste from an prcompany agenda , you might as well be a bot . 
  they were quite succesful in uganda : https://youtu.be/g2w41pvvzs0, 
  you can go for abba ... not many beat them financaly, 
  german : http://m.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-21977916.html#spredirectedfrom=www&amp;referrrer= gritty story, 
  agreed . 
  there are some initiatives to help the survivors . 
  hope this leads somewhere . 
  also , and not because i want to diminish the subject , greece got 30k tons fully functioning machinery ... which they basically melted into scrap metal . 
  very sound analysis . 
  fully agree . 
  he came before and set the rules . 
  just loosing interest by now ... 
  keep making cr\u00e9mant and keep silent :p, 
  da fuck with all that american fascists going on ? 
  while we are at it . 
  bild ( the newspaper linked to ) ignored a threat from raf ... bomb exploded in their office : 38 injured . 
  fight ? 
  whom ? 
  you ? 
  why ? 
  why ? 
  that would turn out great ... 
  to conclude all our puns let me make a modest proposal ... delete them all ... 
  mariupol still missing ... 
  corridor should be roughly 650km wide ... 
  oh . . while we 're at it ... would take back prussia too, 
  alsace is on the wrong side of the border . 
  ok i 'll see myself out . 
  everybody keeps telling you what a `` harsh '' and cold city it is . 
  besides called out by cops for drinking beer at the main station , i really liked it . 
  the harbour is impressive , the bars are very nice , the architecture is very avantgarde . 
  and feyenoor is still ok . 
  in this scenario they also attacked and killed soldiers , planes , tanks from probably 15 nations ... 
  i wonder how `` bad '' is it for asylum seekers in bulgaria ? 
  because while it might look good on paper in germany , i do n't think it 's paradise either . 
  why not do it like in former times . 
  give them a piece of land and let them settle , sustaining themselves ... at least those who fled mostly agricultural societies . 
  they only get support when they are registered and accepted . 
  no support in another country . 
  that very much depends on the `` deals '' that cameron negotiates . 
  he said he would carve out new opt-out rights and whatnot . 
  i guess in 98 % of all issues he 'll simply get a `` non/nein '' and comes back empty-handed . 
  if he looks like a looser ppl might go for the `` out '' . 
  so the question is how does he play it . 
  not all is black & white ... there are many shades of grey in politics ... ( more then 50 btw . . ), 
  it 's called `` stunde null '' ( literally hour zero = setting back the clock ) . 
  suddenly no more nazis from april 1945 onworads ;-), 
  ferry denmark germany is 45already .
