  try bus also . 
  one bad slide presented towards my client kills the order ... nothing unusual, 
  well ... still might be effective : http://imgur.com/gallery/qgcdh8l, 
  rly ? 
  this flow-chart is first year macroeconomics eli5-version . 
  there is no bad bank , no eu-funding ( junker plan does not apply for greece ) , no development bank , and he surely could at least describe the mentioned `` labour market reform '' and `` product market reform '' . 
  this flow-chart is basically `` pump money into the system and it will heal '' - approach ... which it wo n't . 
  surely he could link the reforms to the flowchart and put a number besides it ... although the number might change . 
  but to lecture about `` see ? 
  that way money flows . '', 
  to a group of seasoned politicians and economists does not seem a good idea . 
  besides as the one guy said : the problem is that the infrastructure to realize this flow is not available ... 
  ... another `` now get out or in , but do it full swing '' - case, 
  it 's a shame that there are no east german tier1 clubs left . 
  for all the banter rb leipzig gets - ascending to 1st bundesliga will probably be a very good thing . 
  there is no eli5 to that . 
  but the wikipedia article has some balanced information . 
  because `` bips '' ( at least that 's what i can hear ), 
  tough line ? 
  it 's just non-negotiable ... 
  how hard can it be ? 
  do not compare the holocaust ... it is not comparable . 
  not by numbers , not by `` amount of evil '' involved , not by `` political agenda '' it was based on . 
  if you need to compare - compare the amount of people that knew , but never objected ; compare the industrial dimension and the willingness of people involved , the dehumanizing aspect that was necessary to even consider it , the banality of evil - and the probability `` normal '' people could do it . 
  dutch is my favourite, 
  one 's got more potatoes then the other ? 
  you realize that this would strengthen the big countries ? 
  i mean germany and france can lock down most decisions by sheer mass without veto . 
  that any changes the uk wants are towards less union , while all the rest want more ( harmonizing tax , social welfare , army , immigration ... ) . 
  and foremost : kill the uk rebate . 
  i do n't know how `` bad '' it is , but this even happening once is a sign that the problem is probably cultural . 
  well that 's how the first republic of germany crashed ... 
  considering chinese influence theres not much difference between zte and huawei, 
  huawei has a whole floor in the old eplus hq also . 
  isnt it ggg ? 
  like good guy greece ? 
  ... your phone uses those ... 
  hint : its not the phone thats spying . 
  it 's the network infrastructure they provide . 
  you can choose between nokia , cisco and huawei ... the second biggest german mobile provider o2 has some serious amount of huawei infrastructure . 
  is this the end of all hope for greek hair-cuts ? 
  or how does the true finn sees the bailout ? 
  i know ... saw most of his movies . 
  watch import-export ... or animal love . 
  hundstage is brutal though ... never watched a movie that made me cringe so often ... fremdsch\u00e4men at it 's finest . 
  what about [ a blast ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3813916/ ) ? 
  heard good things about it ? 
  add [ absolute giganten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nscrrd4ckky ), 
  dear poland : enjoy while it lasts . 
  of all places it 's ingolstadt ... deep down bavaria , conservative to the bone , home of audi and several other business hqs , with an unemployment rate of 2.2 ( !!, 
  in the us : not if you are a senator/congress man ... everywhere else : yes . 
  i always wonder if one slimey bastard makes money out of this . 
  the ase index tumbeled -3.9 % , dax over -2 % . 
  you can make a ton of money by going short before such a statement . 
  after the imf doubted the sustainability of greece this morning , i might say the red lines have moved this very morning ... someone said `` now the imf holds a gun to europes and greece heads at the same time '' - sounds about right . 
  they have to roll-over debt ... without access to money they can not do that . 
  it 's not that they do n't pay back . 
  a `` 3rd '' bailout is btw mostly substitute imf by emf , not really `` more debt '' . 
  isnt it nimby ? 
  the port is quite nice though . 
  dachau kicked them out after they wanted to do a picknick on-site ... they said its a russian tradition . 
  that stopped with minimum wage this very year . 
  not that most of it happened before ... 
  a city and a state is hardly germany . 
  economy ... 
  why is it germany , but not china . 
  fraport is a german company , partially owned by a german state , while cosco is probably more of less a chinese sub-ministry . 
  yes !, 
  sure way to kill the whole thing . 
  even don johnson had a bren ( 10 ), 
  can into space ? 
  to be honest i would n't be one bit surprised if they did n't even realize it themselves at the bnd ... just an accident ... 
  do they consider themselves as part of the allies in ww2 ? 
  to be precise : they installed blocking units , so they can cutoff the german grid . 
  btw poland shut down it 's energy grid towards germany ... all the renewable energy `` spilled '' over and messed up with their grid . 
  tomato prices rising 15 % ... 
  `` sry had to pick the kids from school - no air defense after 4pm '', 
  yay selling subs is our thing !, 
  i thought they had a thorough grip . . en on theirs ? 
  `` the woman '' you meant, 
  in before savannajeff, 
  because of the fact that this description is just so interchangeable that it holds absolutely no value ... as seen if used to describe ss soldiers ... 
  german law follows the same idea on some offenses ... even pro-football-player learn it the hard way : http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2pmsiq/marco_reus_fined_540000_for_driving_without_a/, 
  beg to differ ... 
  they said the same about the french foreign legion-soldiers defending dien bien phu ... alas they were mostly former ss-brigades . 
  calling / u/savannajeff, 
  yes . 
  you let `` sytem of a down '' exist i guess ... somehow ironic . 
  well he ' s not wrong ... just an asshole . 
  he also missed the debtcut option . 
  in germany renault isnt that much of a premium that they kept dacia and went the full anti-establishment way . 
  their tv-ads always mocking rich people . 
  seems not only you are attracted by the topic , now you actively attract it too ;-), 
  someone summoned savannajeff by saying the magic words . 
  do you actually actively search for the term to post ? 
  it is a wound that exposes the illness/bigger problem . 
  but this one festered , while the other wounds had been sanitized and are healing . 
  might happen it spreads again though . 
  we had our fair share of people turned to numbers ... as a german : `` this is not a solution ... '', 
  bad choice .
