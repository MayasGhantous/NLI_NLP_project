  very likely . 
  would we have one frankish empire ? 
  - almost a central europe united state !, 
  ah cmon - we can take irony and even identify the fun mocking tone there . 
  it 's cute !, 
  ever watched his speeches ? 
  in hh most ppl . 
  just fell asleep . 
  but he is superboring . 
  yeah ... lets do a blame-cascade : yanks-brits-krauts-dutchys-schluchtenscheiser, 
  nah ... you guys are more natural succesors in the blame game . 
  peer steinbr\u00fcck ... but i must admit angie is not too bad , and he lost the election by a large margin . 
  in case of germany : 6 of the killed were `` psychotic '' or `` suicidal '' . 
  including guys running through street with axe & knife ( still disputed if self-defense ) and a knife-weilding , naked `` messias '' in berlin one of the cases is still at the court - in this case at the highest possible court in germany . 
  the numbers are 2012 ; 2013 : also 8 ; 2014 : 0 . 
  correct answer . 
  have an upvote . 
  they bailed out cyprus banks with close to no domino effect . 
  so point disproved . 
  and in 2011 all greek ppl . 
  had money in their accounts . 
  last one was rejected : http://www.dw.de/an-american-in-bavaria-makes-an-unusual-request-for-asylum/a-18280995, 
  always ask youtself : '' what would homeland security do with an illegal alien ? '', 
  guilty for not defaulting !, 
  the queen even survived being of german descent . 
  ... thats the whole point to bail out any bank ... stop probable domino effects . 
  and any bank has and should have debts at other banks . 
  the greek banks were bailed out for that reason ... to stop them from collapsing . 
  and again : a collapsing bank takes any account owners with it ... all the savers ... all the `` normal '' ppl . 
  2 german brands anyway, 
  i know ... everyone seems to keep forgetting this fact about greek banks being bailed out : http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/17/greece-debt-crisis-bank-exposed, 
  correct ... i said weird , didn ` t i ? 
  same as i said . 
  from 90bn debt that have been held by banks , roughly all was transfered to emf/imf/ezb . 
  included was a bailout of all major greek banks - because they do n't hold much greek debt now . 
  so the bailout included all your petty greek banks , that did exactly the same , as deutsche or bnp paribas . 
  pass it on . 
  otherwise they would have crumbled to pieces too ... including any money of greek people in their accounts ... like pensions , etc. 
  easy to say `` those bad german banks received money '' - yes ... just as the greek banks did receive money ... 
  total reparations ger -  greece : 1948 : 30.000 tons machinery 1960 : 115 mio . 
  dm ( translates to 460mio $ today ), 
  i could do this all day long : small corecction : greek banks received roughly 45bn bailout money , german banks 7bn , france 9bn , uk 2bn , cyprus 3bn . 
  total some 90bn . 
  small corecction : greek banks received roughly 45bn bailout money , german banks 7bn , france 9bn , uk 2bn , cyprus 3bn . 
  total some 90bn . 
  watch `` cremaster '' it 's from her husband and pretty much the definition of weird . 
  edit : it 's roughly 14 hrs and most of it is in youtube : matthew barney - cremaster 3 ( 2002 ) part 1 : https://youtu.be/utleermqzlw, 
  you bet ;-), 
  american : '' do you have electrical power ? 
  cos i see no poles ! '', 
  kpd was forbidden 1956 in germany . 
  german only : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kpd-verbot, 
  and probably for the better, 
  well ... ca n't deny that berlin is a unique place . 
  its raw , brutal , inhuman and haunting . 
  decide yourself . 
  did you watch valhalla rising ? 
  lets turn it around . 
  if every possible solution would be feasible , what would have to be done ? 
  haircut ? 
  probably , but prolonging to infinity has the same effect : moderate to no interest . 
  immediate stimulus package ? 
  how big ? 
  would most likely just sink in an vanish . 
  or pay for lowering some burden-not much stimulus expected . 
  immediate drop of most restrictions to hire/fire/open a business . 
  although im left-ish this might kickstart some things . 
  what else ? 
  i can tell you what it did n't take : `` give more money '', 
  so now you face a state of catastrophe . 
  european offensive ? 
  russians are coming ? 
  so overcome the trenches . 
  somewhere someone has to start . 
  is it ? 
  it says `` ever closer union '' . 
  time to start . 
  you did sign that too btw . 
  differences are inherent to europe , it 's not an obstacle . 
  try to get a berliner and a bavarian to understand each other . 
  one step closer to a real union . 
  netherlands and austria next , obviously, 
  referendum . 
  hastings ? 
  naaaah ... do n't worry . 
  how is this regulated at other countries having a min . 
  wage ? 
  why the fuck is that posted 2 days before it expires . 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b054v0v2 get a proxy . 
  not stated clearly . 
  it says : possible `` secure influence in regional gas market '' , buy-in infrastructure . 
  btw the tpp gets the spotlight right now ... that one seems much more ugly : http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/peruvian-newspaper-reveals-tpp-favors-foreign-companies-20150326-0028.html, 
  wait for it . 
  noone knows what versions got leaked , and it was obvious that the lobbyists enter with maximum demands . 
  it gets heated fast : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2vftz1/you_opinion_dissolve_nato_replaced_by_a_european/, 
  it 's just like at the swiss-german border . 
  living in germany working in switzerland . 
  music . 
  they use music they do n't have to pay for . 
  50bn guaranteed , roughly 10bn/year the last 20yrs towards brussel , roughly 30bn reparations , bn towards russia while being occupied , and again for the russian troops leaving after 1990 .
