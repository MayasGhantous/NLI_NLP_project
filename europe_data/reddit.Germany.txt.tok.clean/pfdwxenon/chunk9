  it 's not that germany is not paying their fair share . 
  steal ? 
  it 's more based on the feeling of `` we did pay a lot since back then '' . 
  considered you would add up all reparations payed , all transfer money given to brussels and retransfered to ( in this case ) greece , all loans and mechanisms ( efsf , etc. ), 
  secured by germany you might get a sum that justifies that feeling for some . 
  so for most it 's not the blame - german do/can take that , it 's the unforgivingness in spite behaving generous . 
  you should not take your username to heart . 
  steiner 's army does not exist anymore . 
  some additional info : almost all studies define `` shortage of qualified employees '' as having a ratio lower then 4:1 candidate : job offers . 
  there 's some cushion . 
  where are the `` but we first on moon '' murica folks ? 
  well one thing is the actual facts of french economy , which does n't seem to get back on track . 
  it 's the middle ground providing the most performance . 
  and the movie : diplomatie http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt3129564/, 
  she invited him ... its a normal procedure . 
  correct . 
  you win even when they just struggle and you are part of the `` market force '' betting on an exit and therefore driving it . 
  selffulfilling prophecy . 
  moraly totally corrupt though . 
  why bet ? 
  buy greek index stocks put options . 
  you 'll end up with a lot more money . 
  that 's a bingo, 
  it 's kind of a national heritage ... with hookers and all : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatort, 
  for those interested in the `` turbo sex scence '' . 
  get a proxy for germany . 
  the tatort is available online from 8pm for the next 7 days : http://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/krimi/tatort/sendung/tatort-berlin-das-muli-100.html it 's more or less 2minutes into the story . 
  american by chance ? 
  that would also suggest `` we already have enough '' which contradicts the ad . 
  the tank reference is pretty accurate and yes it 's an english icon . 
  your point . 
  mini is german though . 
  well the ecb is now in charge of the bank control . 
  how effective this is , might be speculative . 
  but its not a national control anymore . 
  i think they understand that defaulting is an even rougher ride . 
  he 's a battle-hardened political veteran . 
  well renzi can be much less strict , if this is what you desire . 
  just to add : the biggest share went to greek banks . 
  greece desperately need drones . 
  no it exactly shows the point . 
  the us president coined that term as part of a pr strategy to condemn countries , fully aware that it would somehow remind everyone of nazis . 
  the brainwash of your typical joe plumber results in putting all into the same `` bomb em all '' category . 
  and you cant even see the stained semantics you are not able to differentiate anymore . 
  / r/murica that way pls . 
  / r/shitamericanssay final destination . 
  read that again . 
  the fascist agenda sharing partners were n't called axis of evil . 
  just axis , because that is what they called it themselves . 
  the evil notion is an american thing . 
  see thats actually wrong . 
  the axis ( as in japan , germany , italy ) was n't called evil . 
  that term was introduced by good ol george w. state of the union january 29 . 
  europe is the worlds largest economy ... we like to think of europe as one around here . 
  / r/murica this way please . 
  axis of evil will probably include germany for 60 % americans if you ask them . 
  cmon learn to take a joke . 
  i remeber at least 2, 
  ah the axis of ... 
  probably not ... 
  money goes a long way . 
  i do n't want - just answerd the question . 
  and you ca n't deny the fact , that china , the aztecs and the egyptians never went to war ;-), 
  universal declaration of human rights , un charta , paragraph 14 . 
  i do n't quote mrs. thatcher often , but in this case : `` the problem with socialism is that you will run out of others 's people money . '', 
  so you all know `` jin ling '' ? 
  : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jin_ling `` jin ling is a russian brand of cigarettes produced by kaliningrad-based manufacturer baltic tobacco company ( russian : \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430 , btc ) . 
  the name is derived from jinling , the older name of nanjing , where the brand was originally developed by the chinese state-owned nanjing tobacco factory . 
  [ 1 ] after the brand died out , baltic tobacco company re-introduced it in 1997 . 
  [ 1 ] the packet design resembles the american brand camel in colour , typeface and layout , [ 2 ] but instead of a camel , it features a mountain goat . 
  [ 1 ] jin ling cigarettes are only sold illegally and the brand is the first to be designed explicitly for smuggling . 
  [ 3 ] it has been reported by customs officials as the `` most seized '' brand in europe ; [ 1 ] in 2007 , 258 million jin ling cigarettes were seized by authorities in eu countries . 
  [ 4 ] in 2011 it was reported in the uk 's daily mail newspaper that tests on jin ling cigarettes had found them to contain industrial chemicals and asbestos . 
  as long as the poles could n't fight each other because no means to reach . 
  fun fact : randstat is also a worker-lending company, 
  spiegel reports a `` no '', 
  fell for which ? 
  the fake or the fake-fake ? 
  you sir have no surplus at all !, 
  innovation is not ignoring any rules . 
  ecb, 
  still not convinced btw . 
  but much more likely than everything else . 
  pissing off the worldbank . 
  greece does not have profits ... as long as this is a fact nothing will ever help to change the situation . 
  debt or no debt . 
  btw . 
  before someone asks . 
  its not even a primary surplus right now . 
  rpgs come in a lot of variations.not only the typical rpg7 . 
  i doubt it . 
  and i said currency and not economy . 
  problem : you do n't decide . 
  your plutocratic elites do ... and they care, 
  owning debt = grabbing nuts . 
  the chinese could ruin the value of the dollar in a second , just by dumping it on the market . 
  says the guy of which countries debt is owned by china . 
  4trillion by now , right ? 
  hehe ... no american could stand the massive loss of influence . 
  just subtract it ...
