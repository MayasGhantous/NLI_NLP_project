how would atheists marry , do they have to go abroad ? 
  yeah , since child protective services ca n't comment on individual cases due to privacy concern , it becomes very easy to launch media campaigns to push whatever agenda you want . 
  add to that reading ` child kidnapping ' switches people 's brains into outrage mode ... 
  man , the bias in these articles is overwhelming . 
  i laughed when the second one proposed the problem with norwegian foster parents is ... that they 're not married !, 
  we say `` vaterland '' though . 
  australia was just an example of such a rule that i have personal experience with . 
   sorry , i 'm kinda slow today well it is sunday so you 're excused . 
  the suggested approach in the comments above was to get rid of dual citizenship . 
  my counter suggestion is that you can solve the problem of citizens only coming back for election time by tying vote rights to residency requirements . 
  huh ? 
  i 'm proposing this approach as an alternative to outright banning double citizenship . 
  i 'm not against it , i do n't mind not being able to vote in australian elections . 
   would n't you be applicable again if you move back to canada ? 
  yeah sure but then you live in canada again so the moral dilemma of voting in a country you do n't really have anything to do with disappears . 
  customer service is definitely not something we 're known for . 
  in my case no because i was too young to vote a that point but let 's say yes , i would have still needed a residential address in australia . 
  if that was required of all the turk-bulgarians in order to vote i would n't be surprised if many would n't bother . 
  alternatively , look at [ canada 's rules ] ( http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&amp;dir=reg/etr&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e ) where after 5 years you 're simply out of luck . 
   f you are not enrolled , and have been overseas for less than three years , you may still be eligible to enrol if you are :  * an australian citizen aged 18 years or older ,  * intending to return to australia within six years . 
  i 've been living in germany for longer than three years, 
  i imagine that depends on the country . 
  i have german and australian citizenship but can only vote in german elections [ due to these rules ] ( http://www.aec.gov.au/enrolling_to_vote/overseas/index.htm#living ) . 
  even if you could somehow convince officials that your stay abroad is only temporary and you intend to return soon it 's a bunch of additional hoops to jump through . 
  proper communism does n't have a state anyone could be the head of, 
  you do n't have to ban dual citizenships , you can simply tie voting right to residence as some countries do . 
  they 're just rping . 
   your men will be dragged around the streets and killed with swords . 
  please , it 's machetes if anything . 
  yeah , unless he got his meds off the black market it was obviously known ... 
  does n't change the fact that this particular guy is mentally ill . 
  the worst you can see is some blood stains on the floor , really ? 
  30 % of the population , but a little over half if you 're talking among christians , yeah . 
  the size of his butt does n't help, 
  but kicking the woman was an obvious opportunist crime , this is n't . 
  it required the perp to think `` i should go out on my bike and throw acid at random women '' and then actually do it . 
  none of us know why he did it but those are not really the marks of a sane person . 
  marriage predates christianity . 
  not that i 'm aware of . 
  most of our vocal opposition to same sex marriage actually comes from the catholic south . 
   i am simply waiting for a `` test group '' to be raised up and seen if they can function or what the differences are . 
  studies about that already exist . 
  sorry for linking [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_parenting#research ) but it gives a good overview and the citations are fine , too lazy to dig for links right now . 
   have children women ca n't exactly make babies on their own . 
  sounds like an argument to keep a certain amount of young men at home if anything !, 
  that does n't mean they 're wrong or that the system is good . 
  again , you mixed up roles and identity . 
  this bus is ** not ** talking about what girls like doing and why , it 's targeting kids who identify as a gender other than their biological sex and telling people to disregard their experiences . 
  this flies in the face of accepted medical practice and should n't be encouraged . 
  your y chromosome is related to your gender identity in the sense that the sry gene found on it started a process of masculinisation while you were in the womb . 
  since this can go haywire at any step of the way , though , saying `` gender identity is based on your dna '' is going to be wrong in a non-negligible number of cases . 
  neither of these are studies . 
  they also look irrelevant since you did n't say gender roles/gendered behaviour but gender ** identity ** which is an entirely different concept . 
  [ give these a try ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9kkqp9iha5zxu84a_jf0vioah7e8nj_lcw27kbybh0/edit#gid=1074721744 ) and maybe you 'll learn something . 
   they really live in a bubble of innnocence it 's similar over here . 
  there 's a block of streets in my city called `` african quarter '' . 
  growing up i just knew it as a bunch of streets with names like `` kongostra\u00dfe '' or `` togostra\u00dfe '' , never thought much of it - just a little while ago i learned it 's actually a bunch of colonial names . 
  there was supposed to be a human zoo showcasing africans in that area which never got built . 
  sad thing is many people are completely unaware of its history like i was , even sadder thing is some of those who do know are fighting to keep those names . 
  very flattering picture , really brings out her chins . 
   more denial that our gender identity is related to our dna . 
  i 'm sure you have lots of studies to back that up . 
   and fight the forces of satan when you legitimately believe you 're a main character in an apocalyptic blockbuster . 
  i certainly do want it changed , i have no special attachment to sundays so it 's nothing but inconvenience . 
  i can see the point about subsidies ( though nuclear gets plenty of them too ) but why would they take out conventional sources ? 
  a rough outline of what happened : getting rid of nuclear was already decided in 2000-2002 by the spd/greens coalition under schr\u00f6der but merkel 's government decided to extend the deadlines in 2010 . 
  then in 2011 fukushima happened and she changed her mind about the extensions . 
  we call it `` ausstieg vom ausstieg '' . 
  80 % of the population supported this decision , by the way . 
  reddit nuclear advocacy in a nutshell, 
  we export way more than we import overall ... 
   convince germany to embrace nuclear good luck ... 
  they are already trying . 
  i see bundeswehr ads all the time and they recently started youtube web series to reach out to young people . 
  i do n't know how much you earn , though , it 's possible there 's some room there . 
  well the personnel has to come from somewhere , if we wanted 100k more soldiers i imagine we 'd have to re-introduce the draft and that is very unlikely to be backed by most parties or the population . 
  i think the burkini stuff gave people the wrong idea , since that did n't target public servants ( disclaimer : i know it was only a couple towns that banned them , no need to lecture me ) . 
   sometimes , also called klopsy . 
  oh , like [ k\u00f6nigsberger klopse ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6nigsberger_klopse ) . 
  literally in shambles !, 
  meanwhile that guy is doing the exact same by accusing everyone who does n't fear immigrants like he does of `` denial '' . 
  what a joke . 
   almost a majority ( 46 % i think ) are still receiving welfare after 20 years of citizenship . 
  immigrants in the u.s. as a whole contribute 11 % less tax on average when compared to natural born citizens . 
  11 % less does n't seem bad at all considering that welfare statistic . 
  i guess there 's a certain percentage of immigrants who do very well and balance it out ? 
  just like lots of women voted for trump . 
  i 'm sure a lot of them did fall for the brown people boogeyman but some could have internalised anti-gay prejudice as well . 
   interesting side note : those children do n't have any more probability to be gay . 
  i do n't know why anyone would assume so , to be honest . 
  the vast majority of gay people had straight parents ... 
  i do n't see it ? 
  if you want a reinheitsgebot jerk , post about how craft beers are superior on / r/de . 
  oh look it 's the muh craft beer jerk . 
  it 's also about the same size as an a380 , no one would ever think of flying a plane into it . 
  try the fernsehturm or k\u00f6lner dom maybe . 
  the brandenburg gate ? 
  could you possibly think of a more idiotic target ? 
  it 's only 26m high ... 
  i 've literally never seen this happen and all my friends growing up had quite liberal parents ...
