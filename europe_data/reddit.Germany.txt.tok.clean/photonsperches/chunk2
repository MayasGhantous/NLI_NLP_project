  from what i 've heard even a good amount of cdu politicians are onboard with marriage equality at this point . 
  unfortunately the conservative wing is either stronger or given precedence . 
  you replied to the wrong comment , i think . 
  some people suddenly discover their compassion for gays when confronted with muslim immigrants . 
  no problem , i 'm not in the mood to try and convince anyone either . 
   it 's no less of a problem than us military interventionism i think you , me and wagenknecht would all agree to that and i personally believe that is exactly what she 's aiming to point out when she talks about russia . 
  i could be wrong of course but i find it hard to believe she is actually a fan of putin . 
  her answers [ in this interview ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/politik/-deutsche-ukraine-politik-ist-ein-desaster-article12448881.html ) seem to me like she just has a nuanced view on what occurred in ukraine , not that she thinks the invasion is justified . 
  if you google `` wagenknecht fl\u00fcchtlinge '' ( without quotes ) you 'll get a ton of articles about it , mostly of defaming nature . 
  oskar lafontaine has [ also chimed in now ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2017-02/oskar-lafontaine-linke-abschiebungen-fluechtlinge-afd ) . 
  what opinions of her do you consider to be `` insane '' , her economic ideals ? 
  no , that may be your opinion but there are most definitely leftists and centrists who consider her to be right-wing now . 
  there have also been multiple articles like [ this ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2016-10/afd-linke-frauke-petry-sahra-wagenknecht-interview ) saying she has lots of common ground with petry . 
  this is the country that is afraid of google fucking streetview , what do you expect ? 
   unashamed stalin-admirer and hardcore marxist ( sarah wagenknecht ) your smear campaign knowledge is outdated , it 's `` wagenknecht would n't be out of place in the afd '' now because she 's not falling in line with the pro-refugee camp anymore . 
  there 's something funny about a politician being criticised as too left-wing and too right-wing at the same time . 
  something something all poll predictions are wrong, 
  whenever i went to italy i was too busy eating all the good food to complain about anything, 
  i do n't think `` state socialism '' should be there under `` communists '' . 
  communism is stateless by definition and not all communists want to arrive at this goal through state socialism . 
  ( inb4 but ussr ) also , there 's no mixing capitalism and socialism . 
  either workers own the means of production or they do n't . 
  what you mean is social democracy . 
   i do n't think that 's true , i would say the cdu 's stance concerning marriage equality is what they gave their conservative base in return for moving towards the centre on other issues ( to steal votes from spd ) . 
  it 's also [ her personal opinion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_erfnte1hgw ) , not just politically calculated . 
  i think brexit is a bit more complicated . 
  there are quite a few leftists who were in favour of it which you ca n't say about trump . 
  they do have nicer weather . 
   i guess children , parents , siblings would go right away - what about cousins though ? 
  2nd cousins ? 
  [ this could help decide ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dnijhu3.png ), 
   edit : the application of juvenile law on people aged 18-21 varies between 52 % in berlin and 87 % in hamburg . 
  oh look , it 's a unicorn - something the users of / r/de would like about berlin, 
  seems to vary whether they 're counted or not . 
  if you do then there is indeed no country outside the western world that has legalised same sex marriage . 
  i heard taiwan is working on it though so chances are asia will soon be ahead of us germans ... 
   is there any country outside the western world that adopted gay marriage ? 
  depends on whether you count south america as part of the western world . 
  it 's a book from 1934 , no point in taking it too seriously . 
  the author could have probably never imagined the scale of liberation that exists in the west today . 
  i find the inclusion of 18 and 19 year olds in `` teen pregnancy '' numbers very strange . 
  sure , they 're * technically * teenagers , but just one , two generations ago that was a very normal age to start having children . 
  there should n't be anything controversial about it . 
  whatever brigades there may have been in the past have taken permanent refuge ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ heh here . 
  / r/socialism uses the american definition ( socially liberal ) since most of the posters are from the us . 
  in europe it 's reserved for economically liberal parties . 
  or maybe people [ just use it to mean whatever they want , really ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-10658070 ) . 
  maybe it 's like in romance languages where a group that contains at least one male is referred to with a masculine pronoun ( ils , ellos ) ? 
  i 'll give you the s-bahn but bvg is solid . 
  the salute, 
   germany has only one season but it 's rain . 
  that 's not even remotely accurate ... 
   conspiracy 262 -10 77 3.3 i 'm surprised he did n't use the word `` sheeple '' . 
  i have no clue but a lot of germans seem to have a hateboner for the capital , gets worse the further south you go . 
  meanwhile foreign tourists seem to love it . 
  that would be aldi nord . 
   i generally go shopping for products not for feeling . 
  if at aldi is something good ( and they have here in poland some good products compared to competition ) i buy these things and nothing more . 
  yup , and i reckon this pragmatic attitude is more prevalent in the aldi nord areas . 
  of course there are still some ~ ~ bourgies ~ ~ special snowflakes who scrunch up their noses at the mention of aldi but chances are even they use it for basics . 
  expensive cars are certainly a common sight on aldi parking lots . 
   i 'd highly recommend berlin and dresden from the list , seriously cool cities . 
  munich is cool , but does n't hold up to the other two , and leipzig was a good day trip . 
  you 're gon na trigger all the southerners this thread is attracting, 
   if you ever find yourself in an aldi nord , you should reevaluate your life choices . 
  or you know , grab your groceries , pay and leave without getting upset that it 's kind of ugly in there . 
  when you 're so entrenched in your ideology that people lighting candles in a place something terrible happened is `` virtue signalling '' ... does that go for putting flowers on graves as well then ? 
  how deranged can you be ? 
  ca n't say i 've ever heard anyone call themselves prussian . 
  in fact you rarely see or hear any references to prussia , really . 
  it 's just a case of bavarians being `` special '' . 
  germany does have east-west and , even more fundamental in my opinion , north-south divides . 
  bavarians call everyone north of them ` prussians ' and being from berlin i do n't feel connected to them either , they may as well be austrians to me . 
   do you think she faces a threat from her own party ? 
  [ no ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-merkel-cdu-iduskbn13v1xh ) . 
   also , do you think the csu would do the unthinkable and align with the afd ? 
  or is that just crazy ? 
  the csu ( bavarian branch of cdu ) is already pretty close to the afd when it comes to immigration policies . 
  but they are only one state 's subdivision and ca n't dictate the cdu 's course of action . 
  though it is a right-wing party there are numerous moderates among their ranks who would never agree to aligning or working with the afd . 
  the `` home state '' thing just has zero significance . 
  no one cares about that kind of thing here . 
  the cdu lost more % in said state from 2006 -  2011 than 2011 -  2016 , by the way . 
  berlin now has a fully left-wing government . 
  if refugee policy is the problem how can even more immigrant friendly parties win ? 
  it 's literally part of their program to minimise deportations in the city . 
  state elections do n't really tell you much about how the federal elections will go in this country . 
  people feel more safe protest voting or experimenting ( pirate party around 2011 is a good example ) locally than federally . 
  there were coalitions with the left party in state parliaments years before it was even considered a possibility on a federal level by any other party . 
  the afd will certainly get a good amount of votes in 2017 but no one wants to work with them and vice versa . 
  merkel 's approval ratings are solid . 
  the only realistic outcome at this point is another grand coalition . 
  there is no reason for her to feel threatened . 
  the fact that you think perfomance in her ` home state ' ( this is not a thing ) means anything at all shows how utterly clueless you are ... 
   it comes as no surprise that merkel has recently shifted her stance on the issue , as she is now flailing around trying to maintain her chancellorship . 
  hopefully it does n't work . 
  [ uh huh ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/crchart-2923~_v-videowebl.jpg ) , sure is [ looking bad ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/crchart-2921~_v-videowebl.jpg ) for her . 
  totally flailing around . 
  it is n't kind to anyone , really ... 
  it 's a common misconception in germany as well .
