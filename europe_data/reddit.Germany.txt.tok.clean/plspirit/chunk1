oktoberfest, 
  politicians ruin everything, 
  that 's hard , but i go with the hometown bias . 
  my favorite german building is the [ munich new town hall ] ( http://germany-vacations.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/munich-town-hall-building-in-marienplatz.jpg ) for the foreign one i think i have to go with [ mont st. michel ] ( http://cdn.eupedia.com/images/content/mont_saint-michel-1-l.jpg ), 
  i have an answer : christmas , well everybody will complain that they did n't sell as much as they expected but it 's more than last year ( as every year ) and maybe this is the time we have to accept that growth is not infinite , in the end it 's based on human beings and a 24hour day . 
  those wo n't magically get better unless we radically change the way our whole economy works . 
  people are now already twice as productive as what ? 
  30 years ago ? 
  roast saddle of venison with dark sauce , sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage . 
  for dessert zwetschgenkn\u00f6del ( sweet plum in curd dough dumplings with cinnamon and buttered breadcrumbs ), 
  i think anglo-american media has a tendency to fearmonger and being doomsayers in general ( mostly because it sellls ) . 
  at least more so than i 'm used from german media ( although it also hapens here , too ), 
  something in the lines of rooting out the weak and letting the strong win , the pure anarchocapitalist thing, 
  we have our own euro sceptics , and they also get stronger . 
  difficult times alsways bring out the fringes . 
  but you realize that the weak are the employees and the strong are the rich ? 
  buying off politicians not paying taxes exploiting workers and crapping on customers because of the lack of alternatives ? 
  this would end in an monopolistic corporate tyranny you need a baseline of regulations to ensure fairness and avoid human suffering . 
  i 'm not talking communism here , just a healthy set of rules . 
  oh , so you 're literally hitler . 
  well then ... 
   perhaps the ones that denounce germans/eu are just more vocal than the `` silent majority '' . 
  oh yes absolutely , but almost every time i see an article with a topic like `` germany is doomed '' it 's either the guardian or the telegraph or some other co.uk site i 'm pretty sure it 's a certain clique of economists and economy journalists that write these articles . 
  i think in general the british population is quite positive about germans , and most germans like the brits . 
  do you want to live in gotham ? 
  angst ? 
  afraid ? 
  as a german i can say you this is just bullshit , hyperbole , exaggeration . 
  yes germans value their privacy more than most other western countrymen , yes unions are strong , but no we do n't fear google and we do n't live in permanent angst of a dystopian future . 
  we jsut want people to get paid a living wage , companies should n't have all the power and privacy is important . 
  do n't throw it away just to find the nearest starbucks easier . 
  look at american politics and how money rules it , not the people . 
  yeah stupid germans trying to keep the power by the people ... 
  especially if you ask british ones , if british newpapers were right we would all live in caves right now, 
  not really close ( ~ 90km munich to kufstein ) , but close enough to save some money when driving to austria to fill the gas tank ( at least it used to be ) but really all you recognize of the border is sometimes a red/white/red marking on a rock in the alps knowing you crossed to austria while on your weekend trip , kasse is called kassa and the dialect is slightly different . 
   is it not wine all the same why should it not be allowed because it was not made in some providence in france ? 
  it is , but you ca n't call it like the wine from there . 
  why do you even want that ? 
  you do n't seem to understand , it 's a brand like any other , back to iphones , as an analogy , what if i worked at apple and then go somewhere else to open my own business , use what i learned at apple and make my own phone . 
  i 'm not allowed to call it iphone . 
  why would a cheesemaker be able to call his cheese parmesan if he is not from parma , in the parmesan consortium , abiding their rules and regulations and using the local products of parma to make the cheese . 
  they are registered , maybe not in the us or china , but at the european patent office or at least the regional one , at least i know it of the german products like m\u00fcnchner wei\u00dfwurst and th\u00fcringer bratwurst , n\u00fcrberger etc. 
  are registered as `` of protected origin '' at the dpma ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsches_patent-_und_markenamt ) in case of the m\u00fcnchner wei\u00dfwurst there was a bit of a controversy when there were complaints to widen the region to old bavaria and swabia from just munich and so is prociutto di parma ( http://www.prosciuttodiparma.com/en_uk/consortium ) not sure about the cheeses but why would it be so for meats and not for cheese, 
  but those products , like parmesan , are protected brands/trademarks or whatever it 's called . 
  a real parmesan can only be from parma , like a wiener schnitzel has to be veal and a m\u00fcnchner wei\u00dfwurst has to be from munich . 
  they are registered , as someone already said , it 's like calling all smartphones iphone , apple would n't like that . 
  ok should have framed it another way , rounded edges should n't be trademarkable using those is nothing other than bullying imho, 
  freedom fries with freedom cheese , sounds right, 
  well apple goes too far , rounded edges is not a trademark or patent . 
  that 's like trademarking 4 wheels on a car . 
  it 's misleading yes . 
  most of these product are named after regions they are made in . 
  you ca n't jsut make a good product and then profit from the brand name established 5000 miles ( and often hundreds of years ) away . 
  that 's like selling boston lobster from the north sea or new york steak from bavaria . 
  what does that number mean ? 
  10 million , is that since the beginning of the eu , this year ? 
  last year ? 
  a month ? 
  since the elections ? 
  much appreciated , 
   you said a `` goose is a swan . '', 
  no , i did n't, 
  ok , i have to be * that * person , those `` swans '' are geese . 
  sincerely a biologist who ca n't keep his mouth shut, 
  same here , i did n't even know movies could be so expensive . 
  usually you get a ticked for 4,50-6 $ in germany if it 's not 3d over overlength ( overlength is usually 1 $ more ), 
  never been there :( . 
  i was once in hungary but only just over the border at the neusiedler see , fert\u00f6-hans\u00e1g . 
  oh hey , i came here to say austria too , but for the exact opposite reason . 
  i grew up in munich and the ( bavarian ) alps , tirol and the salzburger land are where i spent most time when going on short trips or vacation . 
  when i was a kid we stayed at a farm at the chiemsee every summer , and for skiing in winter we went , with one exception , always in austria . 
  yes actually , reading dutch is totally possible without knowing any english ( german is my native language ) but it helps understanding it better if you also know english understanding a bit of the skandinavian languages is also possible but much harder, 
  fluently 2 , german and english , had in school , will understand , and not starve 3 french spanish italian , can read a bit since it 's closely related to german , dutch so if you want 2-6, 
  copyright claims are a good sign there 's something shady going on, 
  hard to say , we were a bunch of infighting `` barbarian '' tribes until the romans came and `` civilized '' parts of germany , while they got kicked in the balls by the rest . 
  since i was born and live south of the danube , i have at least partly roman ancestors . 
  the holy roman empire was then for a long time the predominant power in germany which is also based on rome . 
  then the 30 year war destroyed a national identity which was only restored when the prussians declared them selves kaiser and forced the smaller independent parts of germany into the kaiserreich . 
  well and then came hitler who created that myth of the nordic blond blue eyed master race of aryans , i 'm sure you all know that ... oh and there is [ germania ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/germania_%28personifikation%29 ) tl ; dr germany has no national myth , or many national myths . 
  there are franks allemans goths teutons saxons bavarians , there are habsburger wittelsbacher stauffer and hohenzoller , there are freie reichst\u00e4dte with each their own myths and the hanse . 
  btw . 
  the oldest settlements are 700,000 years old * homo neanderthalis * and * heidelbergensis * , neolithic cultures etc. 
  after reading this , and seeing germany on rank 3 , i ask why is the press portraiting the germans as significantly pro russian and unwilling to help ? 
  why ? 
  all we get from france is cars . 
  f\u00f6hn is the name of a warm wind in the alps . 
  not much , we get informed about what happens , usually without any judgment or opinions on it . 
  i think my answer is obvious , 
  the most variety and best hot sausages , germany and poland , the best sandwich cold sausages ( esp . 
  salami ) italy and hungary, 
  i hope 2  mind merge is not a thing yet, 
  damn , i 'm older than the average ... 
  somehow i think a bassett hound with a pipe and a sherlock holmes hat fits perfectly, 
  [ bayrischer defiliermarsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smpkppiiwok ) that moment on the first saturday of the wiesn when you get your first ma\u00df , the silver salutes boom in the sky and the band plays this . 
  then you know you 're in bavarian heaven . 
  dito ( or for the english speakers ditto ), 
  i did n't know that what we call krapfen berliner pfannkuchen krebbel and propably a few other names are typical polish pastry and somehow i 'm a bit disappointed you did n't chose r\u00fcblikuchen for switzerland . 
  sometimes i have the feeling those authors do n't know what growth and percent mean . 
  as promised [ earlier ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2d5a82/hey_reurope_post_the_view_from_your_window/cjmhxqj ) , here 's a shot out of my window : this time it 's [ ulm , germany ] ( http://imgur.com/xv6yjmk ) though , i only have an older pic of [ munich ] ( http://imgur.com/twur4ih ) , so do n't wonder why it 's winter ( and evening ) . 
  right now http://imgur.com/mitenef but i promise to take one tomorrow and add it here , it 's munich btw .
