  and not being illegal does n't mean it should be practiced either . 
  that 's not racism , that 's not criticizing immigration , that is inciting the masses , incitement of violence . 
  different things something like `` i do n't want a stinking immigrant in my town '' is not illegal , it 's impolite , it 's racist , it 's not illegal, 
  funny how he did n't say anything about germany trying to control social media and the internet censoring `` racist '' comments about immigration . 
  edit : if you want free speech and the freedom of press and religion , you have to accept the ugly sides too . 
  anyone downvoting me for argueing for free speech , just remember me when it 's your opinion getting silenced , not just the racists ' ones . 
  i do n't want to have the gdr back ... 
  i just do n't get it , you 're sitting here let them take your rights away just because you agree on the reason ( while simultaneously lambasting the polish govt for doing the same , but it 's totally different because they 're of a different political leaning than you ) ? 
  we have a blasphemy law in germany too , one guy got fined i think 5000 $ for writing qu ` ran verses on toilet paper . 
  and in bavaria it 's illegal to dance on good friday, 
  if you look closer , you see the border is covered by the background of the luxemburg searches . 
  ( like albania and sicily ), 
  nothing really surprising honestly , only hyundai , did n't expect to see it so much . 
  i think that 's a good idea , you have to show people bad ideas so they can later recognize and dismiss them as such . 
  [ here 's what my mom baked this year ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hqxvnoc.jpg ), 
  what happens if a blonde moves from germany to austria ? 
  the average iq in both countries goes up . 
  yes but it 's red , those borders are there to show what it looks like before the proposal , red areas after proposal, 
  did you look at your west border ? 
  do we have any background knowledge or was it for totally no reason other than they being muslim ? 
  24th filet mignon , usually with crispy potato cubes and grilled vegetables 25th turkey or goose with sprouts and potato wedges ( turkey ) , or red cabbage and potato dumplings ( goose ) 26th venison with sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage but we 're all grown up now , in germany the 24th usually has just a cheap fast dinner since presents are opened after dinner . 
  common is potato salad with frankfurters or frikadeller . 
  carp is also a traditional christmas food , personally never had one though . 
  strange how they 're not concerned about legal action against eu countries when it comes to ttip, 
  or you just do n't believe anything anymore because both sides are just bullshit ideology and clickbait . 
  hey trudeau , it 's 2015 !, 
  yeah took me forever to find the country i was looking for , could at least have been in alphabetical order, 
  ok ... your critique is then just more valid, 
  oh yes , down there , thanks , but that still does n't explain how they never go over 1 with the three individual scores https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index so what it means is they never can have the sum of eyi and myi greater than 2 but that would happen for let 's say mean years of education of 15.5 and expected years of education of 20 in a country that would mean the score is of ei is ( 15.5 / 15 + 20/18 ) / 2 = 1.072  education index is calculated from expected years of schooling ( number of years a child of school entrance age can expect to spend in a given level of education ) and mean years of schooling ( average number of completed years of education of a population [ 25 years and older ] ) . 
  expected years of schooling is indexed by dividing by 18 and mean years of schooling is indexed by dividing by 15 . 
  education index is obtained by averaging these two indices . 
  the maximum for mean years of schooling , 15 , is the projected maximum of this indicator for 2025 . 
  the maximum for expected years of schooling , 18 , is equivalent to achieving a master 's degree in most countries . 
  states the numbers can not go over 15 and 18 , but there are numbers like 20 for new zealand i do n't get it, 
  i do n't know how the index is factored into the score , and how it is always a number below 1 when it 's ( mysi + eysi ) / 2 and mean and expected years can be higher than 15 or 18 respectively which would result in scores higher than 1 all i guess is they think somehow that more education is better education ? 
  universities getting ph.d. etc. 
  a ph.d. in germany for example takes 12 years of school , 5 years of masters degree ( 3 bachelor 2 master ) and another 3-5 years promotional work . 
  while the minimum amount of school is 9 years . 
  so you get an average of something like 16.5 years . 
  is mostly used now as `` wtf ! '', 
  or `` holy shit ! '', 
  for example if you get almost hit by a car you might say `` alter schwede das war knapp '' ( old swede , that was close ), 
  or marxists , but that 's the same in the end anyways . 
  to create another bubble ? 
  if startups do n't make it that has reasons , do n't artificially suppress those reasons , they will come to light . 
  better slowly and constantly than in a bursting bubble again . 
  sadly it has always been that way . 
  the left in germany has a subset that is only out to fight the police , it 's punk and left anarchists within others , just out to provoke and destroy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaos_days https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_day_in_kreuzberg and then there is the tradition of environmentalist and anti nuclear power protests , that usually ended up with injuries, 
  but saying men are better is sexist and anti-feminist you know what it really is ? 
  we value women , we protect women , men are expendable . 
  something tells me this thread will soon see  locked - too many rules-breaking comments, 
  violent protest is violent protest , no matter who protests what . 
  feminism is an ideology , how can a single ideology be generalized ? 
  by the dictionary maybe . 
  but i do n't believe in patriarchy or intersectionality or nonbinary gender norms and gender as a social construct , women as a class or that i was born to rape and have to unlearn it, 
  still waiting on rational education and what is a `` zealous falsehood '' i posted ? 
  we 're talking not about the definition of feminism , we 're are talking about feminism, 
  sure nothing is ever true for every member of a large group , especially one that is so vaguely defined . 
  and i think everyone should have equal rights and opportunities . 
  you seem like a nice guy with honest good intentions , probably like most who never heard of people like [ andrea dworkin ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=andrea+dworking&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=swhivpzceybgywpl-quiaq#q=andrea+dworkin ) , [ bell hooks ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=bell+hooks&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=eahivohzjcopyqpu7luqcq ) , [ alice schwarzer ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=alice+schwarzer&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=iahivp6ufaj6ygofkr7oca ) , [ gloria steinem ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=gloria+steinem&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=6whivtd_ayv6ywoxqlxwcq ) , [ jessica valenti ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=jessica+valenti&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=8ghivs_si8vlywoe2rwqag ) , [ laurie penny ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=laurie+penny&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=owlivrs5eolnygp3zqey ) etc. 
  unlearning sexism , compulsory consent classes , safe spaces , toxic masculinity , women are always victims , gender is a social construct , redefining/banning words and so on . 
  that 's what prominent feminists do . 
  [ this is what i object to ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aef6igwdkl4 ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1zctjat4pu ) , and it 's exactly in line with handing out feminist books to teens . 
  oh that 's how it goes , i actually care about facts and freedom of speech . 
  if you think you can convince anyone , why not me ? 
  then enlighten me, 
  a lot of feminists are actually marxists . 
  they only switched the classes from economic to gender and races . 
  maybe they look at the wrong places , for the wrong people ? 
  as i always say , censorship achieves nothing . 
  on the contrary , it 's damaging , humans are those strange beings who want something the more , the less they can have it . 
  and being able to put ideas into the light of public scrutiny and even mockery will prevent them from hiding in dark cellars forming echo chambers and breeding radicals . 
  yes , and ? 
  `` it 's the circumstances not the people '' ... that is an excuse, 
  no i 'm not , but i 'm incapable of understanding how this excuses violence . 
  or how you try to paint a violent mob as victims . 
  yeah that 's totally understandable then , you 're in a shitty situation so start getting violent and make it even more shitty ... 
   it 's the simple fact that there are a lot of young men travelling alone here . 
  and that 's an excuse or what ? 
  i 'm a young man and i have n't started any mass brawl and the last physical altercation happened when i was 9 or 10, 
  sooo , 10 or 11 horses were involved with humans sexually , that could be one person fucking all 11 or at most 11 people . 
  ( 10 % of 105 cases of maltreatment ) do n't know if that 's many for a population of 8 million, 
  i tried to explain in the comment before that , why it 's dangerous . 
  pushing bad ideas in the dark , letting them breed there etc. 
  and back to my book example , what is history for ? 
  to learn from . 
  if you do n't teach `` offensive '' parts of history people are more likely to repeat them . 
  if you do n't know anything about fascism you might vote for the next hitler because you 're not educated enough to recognize the danger of the ideas he/she 's propagating . 
  ( and if people then refrain from calling that person what he/she really is , the next hitler , because polititcal correctness you have a recipe for disaster ) if you want a definition of political correctness , i can give you mine : trying to avoid offending people regardless of context or price . 
  it 's feelings before facts . 
  in a working society you just need to offend , first you can never not offend anyone anyways , and second new ideas are almost always offensive to some because they question the current paradigms , evolution through natural selection was hugely offensive , or time and space not being seperate things , or that women can be rapists . 
  the problem with political correctness though is , it competely ignores context . 
  like removing books with the word nigger in them from the curriculum because they are not politically correct , even if those books are written 150 years ago and condemn racism . 
  that 's just stupid , there is no need to get all technical about definitions if the praxis shows us clearly why it 's harmful . 
  we are at a point where context does n't matter anymore . 
  this comment is on some srs watchlist now for the word nigger in it . 
  i 'm now a racist . 
  or bullshit like this https://reason.com/blog/2015/02/19/male-student-banned-from-campus-because#.ogwbu0y:u9px pc says , do n't trigger , feelings over facts , ban that guy a rational person say , sorry but he 's not your rapist , i ca n't ban him from class, 
  that 's a fallacy , there is no either or , it 's not either radical germans or radical muslims, 
  it is only circular if censorship and self-censorship is the same the unvoluntary restraint of speech is censorship , there is not anything more needed to make it censorship .
