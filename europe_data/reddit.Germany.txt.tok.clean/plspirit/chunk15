  no special means or some entity `` supervising '' it . 
   some things are not said anymore ; and for good reason . 
  name one ( a good reason , not a thing that should n't be said anymore ) no there is none , forbidding speech , as offensive as it might be , wo n't ever solve anything , only keeps `` bad speech '' confined to smaller circles creating echo chambers and subcultures which are then the breeding grounds for radicals letting everyone speak everything makes those who have bad ideas stand in the spotlight and get demolished by people with good ideas . 
  that 's the only way to get rid of bad ideas . 
  the only one . 
  sweeping those ideas under a rug jsut does that , hides them from a superficial glance , but also allows them to breed and mutate in the dark without any supervision . 
  and that makes them dangerous . 
   it is the faculty of regulating one 's own speech . 
  no not at all , it 's preemptively self censoring to avoid repercussions . 
  the only difference to just censorship is , it 's preemptive being polite is not self censorship , not saying something out of fear of being called racist sexist misogynist homophome transphobe islamophobe is . 
   censorship without the self - is a restraint placed on public speech or publication by an authority . 
  yes and the authority is the public in the case of political correctness . 
  if i have to fear to lose my ob , be a social outcast , for having a different opinion i have two options . 
  make my opinion public and suffer the consequences , or self censor . 
  the result is the same regarding public speech , some things are not said anymore . 
  political correctnes is the means to self censorship . 
  censorship is never good , and the number 1 indicator of an oppressive regime . 
  it starts with book burnings and end with the systematic purge of wrong thinkers , the 20th century had dozens of examples, 
  so 1.5 million refugees , 99 % think the bombers were wrong , makes 15000 people in our middle thinking they were right , if only 0.1 % of them actually plan an attack it 's still 15 active terrorists, 
  did i write per meal ? 
  i meant per day , and you forgot the 4,72 or what it was for drinks  so `` the shelter is not allowed to cook their own food '' is not true as well . 
  that was a church who took in refugees on their own , the pastor said on tv they were not allowed to provide their own food in the end it 's too expensive and too bureaucratic, 
  something nobody seems to talk about when addressing the refugee crisis . 
  there are people making tons of money on the back of it . 
  one shelter in munich pays 20 $ per ~ ~ meal ~ ~ day for a refugee , because there is only one contractor the city ( i guess , maybe it 's bavaria ) pays to cater to the refugees . 
  that food is shit , you would n't pay 3 $ in a cantina or mensa for it if you had the choice . 
  and the worst about it is , the shelter is not allowed to cook their own food ( which would be cheaper and better ) . 
  or the fact that real estate is booming , some real estate firms are buying up old taverns for cheap , put a bit of money in and then house 60 , yes sixty or even more refugees in them , getting 200 $ a month from the state for each one of them . 
  a lot of the money this crisis costs , does n't go to the refugees , it ends up in the purses of some exploitative business men , and it 's our tax money . 
  ( comparable to the private prison situation in the us ) and that 's just what i heard from my parents in munich . 
  it 's ok in bavaria and baden-w\u00fcrttemberg, 
  so why exactly is the 2011 attack in germany where a kosovo-albanian teenager killed 2 us soldiers in frankfurt not marked as islamist ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arid_uka he even shouted allahu akbar before shooting . 
  how on earth do you come to the conclusion i 'm a neonazi ? 
  not necessarily , which is expressed in the [ horseshoe theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) they end up being practically the same , but for different reasons, 
  my answer would be : `` all of them ? '', 
  extremism is never good , in the best case the individual only risks his/her own health or sanity , in the worst case , well you know ... 
  i think we apply a double standard on extremists groups , trying to undermine democracy . 
  if we were honest , we 'd put all those groups in the same category as neo-nazis , be them left , right , religious , or any other ideology driven dangerous fringe group . 
  yeah i do n't see how schengen has anything to do with immigration other than that people already inside the schengen area moving freely throughout it . 
  the problem lies on the borders not inside . 
  the best thing we can do is stick together , support each other and laugh at their faces . 
  do n't show fear , show compassion ( to each other , not them ) and mock the hell out of them . 
  they are the bullies who violate you until you hit back , just to then claim victim hood . 
  ( this is basically how you fight any ideology , not just religious fundamentalists ), 
  and they 're concentrated in cities , raising percentages up to 30 % and above of the population in that area, 
  nationalism is n't inherently bad , only if you use it as an excuse for hate against `` the outgroup '' there are always two ways to look at things , the optimist and the pessimist way . 
  if someone says something like `` my country is the best '' you could call him a nationalist , but that statement has no implications about the stance of this person about any other country . 
  that same person could say `` and i love country x i spend there every holiday , but i think i could n't live there permanently because they do things differently which is not to my taste '' and then comes a person and calls that first person racist and nationalist . 
  give this to an offendatron and you have east germany all over again . 
  how about not making it illegal , you would n't have to search homes and spend tons of money finding these people . 
  it 's so much easier just to publicly ridicule them . 
  not 100 % serious , but 100 % unique , the bavarian [ watschentanz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lomtgkrbhd0 ) which is a version of the schuhplattler . 
  ( yes watschen means slapping the face ), 
  snowman seems to be a girl and american thing, 
  but to be fair , we just like rules and tidiness more than all the others , except maybe switzerland we 're not all efficient diligent and hard-working , we 're just more of it than most others , and value it in our culture . 
  [ and do n't forget the sausages ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04k6rcj ), 
  sorry , i have to choose austria , we bavarians are just too similar , but poland is my close second . 
  and not just because my mothers parents came from silesia, 
  by sheer numbers [ peter niersch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_niers ) takes the crown , but he confessed under torture so take that with a grain of salt . 
  a more recent one who made international news was the [ cannibal of rotenburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armin_meiwes ) and another one who caused quite a stirrup in germany at least was a [ nurse \\ ( male \\ ) ] ( http://www.fr-online.de/panorama/prozess-gegen-krankenpfleger-der-todespfleger-von-delmenhorst,1472782,29975246.html ) who allegedly killed up to 200 ( proven 2 , confessed about 30 ) sick and terminally sick people in a hospital in delmenhorst he worked at well and then there is the obvious . 
  berlin is the new moscow of the 1960s, 
  you should be aware though that northern italy has more rain in the winter than germany over the whole year . 
  i 'd choose the alpine regions then at least you have snow . 
  lago di garda lago di como etc. 
  or south tyrol . 
  but austria and switzerland are also nice . 
  threatening ? 
  `` you 'll regret that '' does n't mean `` we will make you regret that '' . 
  if you want to buy a chinese car and i say to you you 'll regret that i 'm not threatening you . 
  1 year probation for stamping qu ` ran verses on toilet paper http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article200310/klopapier-mit-koran-bestempelt-bewaehrungsstrafe-fuer-fruehrentner.html and in my opinion every law that deals with thought-crime is stupid , even if it 's not prosecuted at all , that does n't make it any better , and the potential for abuse is there as long as it is written in the grundgesetz, 
  they should arrest him ( if that was really arrest worthy ) , that would finally show how stupid those laws are . 
  it 's been 70 years now . 
  and when they 're at it , the blasphemy law can also go down the drain those `` anti-free-speech '' laws can so easily be abused , and suddenly normal people sit in jail cells for criticizing islam , immigration , israel or some such . 
  i get that warm hands thing too , but i usually have really hot hands , my dad even uses me as a hot patch for his shoulder when i come visiting your description is pretty much also applicable for germany, 
  that all those surrounding countries are our friends , not potential enemies , even if we disagree . 
   food ? 
  cheapest in eu , mostly . 
  yet restaurants are pretty expensive , the cheap ones are fine and the high end ones too , but the bog standard middle of the road around the corner greek or italian restaurant can be pretty expensive with mediocre food like 20 $ for a piece of fish with potatoes or a steak, 
  i think that german media is mostly left leaning , apparently people think to differ, 
  just the city itself , for munich + surrounding areas i only found a number from december 2011 which was 2.7 million and the metropolitan area munich is 5.7 million ( dec 2013 ) , but that 's basically the whole of [ southern bavaria including augsburg ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/metropolregion_m%c3%bcnchen#/media/file:landkreise_bayern_metropolregion_m%c3%bcnchen.svg ) [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metropolitan_regions_in_germany ) is the english wikipedia page listing the german metropolitan areas , the purple one is munich, 
  hm munich reached 1.5 million this year , from 1.4 million in 2013 reaching 1.6 million is expected to happen in 2018 , and is expected to grow to 1.77 in 2030 . not sure if stockholm really is the fastest growing city in europe that would be 200k in 5 years at 1.4 million that 's almost 15 % in 5 years [ german source ] ( http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/stadtverwaltung/referat-fuer-stadtplanung-und-bauordnung/stadtentwicklung/grundlagen/bevoelkerungsprognose.html ), 
  so why do you tell me then ? 
  what has that to do with anything i said ? 
  rome became christian around 350 the saxons were forcefully converted to christianity by the [ frankish empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saxon_wars ) 400 years later . 
  [ same for scots the irish and other norse and germanic religion dominated areas . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianization#christianization_of_europe_.287th-15th_centuries.29 ), 
  the saxons were forced to adopt it by the franks , rome becoming christian did n't mean the whole of europe became christian too . 
  that took a few hundred years of forced conversion , conquering and war, 
  this is ubisoft right ? 
  but since they 're in montr\u00e9al should french also get a canadian flag ? 
  when my brother was in elemetary school they went on a field trip to the local zoo and the zoo had the audacity to feed the snakes when they were there . 
  even worse they fed them guinea pigs . 
  the mother 's outcry was loud , the little girls tears were n't even dry a local tabloid wrote about this . 
  that was over 20 years ago . 
  nothing changed , same bullshit as always . 
  funny how they use right-wing as an insult and put the afd and pegida in the `` far right '' corner . 
  no they 're just right of everyone else , which are basically all left . 
  far right is the npd , dvu ( do they even exist still ? ), 
  and republiker .
