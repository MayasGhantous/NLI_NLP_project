  this : [ the wirtschaftswunder ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wirtschaftswunder ) , and i think it 's still going , although the reunification made a dent in our economical success , it was a huge cultural and political success . 
  reddit will tell you if they know, 
  as a bavarian , i 'm not so sure what to think about this  . 
  joke aside , occupation is bad , they even changed tyrol to tirol and baiern to bayern after that , for whatever reason . 
  it 's a shame that austria and bavaria had so many conflicts in the past . 
  yeah those up north , they are totally suspicious, 
  the [ german peasant 's war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_peasants%27_war ) besides from the [ 30 years war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_years_war ) and the two world wars , [ napoleon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleonic_wars ) and the [ crusades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crusades ) , the [ great turkish war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_turkish_war ) and a lot of wars between france prussia and austria maybe the biggest and most impacting war in germany . 
  i go for the posh version : filet mignon , or any other high class french restaurant food . 
  ( although the french roommate i had a few years back in dorm had a horrible taste and what he cooked was awful ), 
  i think it 's derived from even earlier , when the saxon tribes settled the north german plains and it stuck . 
  just like the italians call us ( the people and the language ) tedesco derived from deutsch , like the other skandinavian countries and the netherlands for example . 
  french call us allemange from the allemans . 
  the englisch german from the germanic tribes and so on . 
  i looked a bit into it , but did n't really find a reason but here 's a [ map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_germany#mediaviewer/file:germany_name_european_languages.svg ) that shows the different linguistic versions of calling germans, 
  so in finnish we are all saxons ? 
  in germany women 's rights people were enraged , because bavaria introduced a m\u00fcttergeld , mother 's money , which is a state funded little bit of money you get if you stay at home as a mother ( or father ) . 
  they screamed that this disencourages women to get into their careers , and is back to the old stayathome mom mentality etc blabla . 
  turns out mothers love it and use it gladly . 
  `` forcing '' women into a job is just as stupid as denying them access . 
  it 's a womans choice , not a politicians if she wants to pursue a career or stay at home . 
  you have to create equal opportunity not force quantitative equality . 
  do n't forget esa, 
  i still have this achievement on my profile showcase on steam because it 's among the 5 rarest i have, 
  i guess you have to write explicitly `` this is a joke '' on every joke on the internet, 
  because they ca n't afford all that poison the industial nations put in ? 
  scientists philosophers and artists , einstein watt darwin gauss gogh picasso russeau kant, 
  at least we include the alpenvorland, 
  [ zwetschgenkn\u00f6del ] ( http://media.kuechengoetter.de/media/16/11964593948920/7742-7200_162_2_det_001.jpg ) , sweet dumplings made of a curd ( [ quark ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quark_%28dairy_product%29 ) ) dough filled with damson plum ( [ zwetschgen ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwetschge ) ) and brown sugar . 
  i know it from my silesian grandparents , so you can count it as german or polish if you want . 
  the austrian , czeck or hungarian version is filled with apricots and sometimes a potato dough is used . 
  i got almost the same result , only singaporean and american is flipped , i 'm also german, 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : us black vernacular / ebonics singaporean american ( standard ) our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : finnish english dutch how it 's possible to get english as a second most accurate guess for native language and ebnoics and american as first and third guesses for dialect is strange . 
  dutch is pretty close , since i 'm german, 
  better late than never ... doing nothing is the worst , and i 'm cynical i ca n't help it , i was born this way, 
  yeah 20 years after they could have done it and politicians in the senate and house still voted against it . 
  oh i 'm sorry , i got snarky with that freedom comment , that 's does n't change anything though the last news i heard about the us is the cotton gin thing , the last i heard from south korea is pink women 's parking spots and high heel friendly sidewalks and vaccination and climate change are serious , the latter maybe the biggest threat to humanity ever !, 
  what exactly are you talking about ? 
  i find the rise of christian fundamentalism worrying in south korea , the us on the other hand ... never mind , anti vaccers , climate change denialism , young earth creationism , anti science , anti equality , corporacracy , nsa scandal , financial inequality , open racist politicians but hey you got guns and freedom !, 
  the same freedom that makes you hate a federal healthcare system ... 
  why is south korea so far down there ? 
  is it because of north korea and people not knowing the difference ? 
  ( which would also explain why so many are positive about nk ) i 'd rank them higher than the us , with all that climate change denial , net neutrality , sopa pipa bullshit etc. 
  while south korea has one of the most vibrant internet cultures and mobile speeds anyone in the west would dream of . 
  oh and hitler is better ? 
  i guess that 's true , a mention would have been nice, 
  it does n't say they gained a huge amount of votes in the title , only that they will enter the first time and that 's sad but true and the afd 6.5 % is ridiculous , they are also quite right in some places ( although they are a mix of many including non-right views ), 
  crazy , so many far right and anti-european votes . 
  i 'm sad now . 
  that 's not new , was the same last time, 
  kind of true , source i 'm a german , but it 's an age thing . 
  in germany there is a secret law making everybody at the age of around 50 to go to a secret anger camp . 
  there you learn how to complain , which is occasionally transferred to younger germans that are in company of older ones . 
  that explains why you 'll also find the anger at younger ages , although not so frequently . 
  munich bavaria germany , most tourists are from within germany , italy , us , japan and china . 
  the latter 3 mostly just stay a few days , get run through the iconic bavarian tourist places like the hofbr\u00e4uhaus . 
  and then there is this thing in september , you know where tweens come from all over the world to get drunk , 
  the `` normal '' german r is produced with the throat ( uvula ) , the bavarian r with the tongue, 
  yes regions in the internet are just stupid , i hope netflix let 's us watch the original versions , if i want german language stuff i can watch the big bang theory on every fucking service ever ... 
  you are part of europe , that 's like saying bavarians invading germany, 
  turns out again the citizens of a country are more intelligent than their elected officials, 
  because it 's comedy , satire and `` kabarett '' are our strenghts , german comedy does n't work without serious undertones . 
  it 's true , we germans drink a lot of beer in lederhosen or dirndl , eat pretzels and like to party to traditional blasmusik . 
  but it 's only true for southern bavaria , the rest of germany is miserable moody and efficient !, 
  ( not that bavarians are n't also efficient :p ), 
  that ca n't be possible , no matter how you calculate the points edit : well ok , not impossibe after a second thought , it means some points the juries distribute get lost when there are 10 countries that score bette after the combination of the points , example germany gets 1 point from the jury and the public votes germany 0 points and public and jury agree on the rest , the one point gets lost since you now have eleven countries with points, 
  i guess there are a lot of national versions , at least we have one in germany , it 's called `` das perfekte dinner '' the perfect dinner , with different variations like celeb version ( while celebrity means people who sometimes appear on tv but nobody cares about , like soap `` stars '' ) or bundel\u00e4nder ( state ) battles . 
  but i 'd totally watch it with 5 contestants from 5 different european countries , should be interesting . 
  no , that 's just a place with enough space to make a photo of all of them together, 
  haha awesome , never knew / r/ulmgonewild existed , and definitly did n't expect what it really is . 
  i have ck2 and eu4 both on my steam account , but did n't get around playing much . 
  oh i have a stack of post its flying around with important appointments , email reminders etc. 
   ( get well soon btw ) thanks you, 
  i do n't even have a calendar , i 'm not very good at such thing , missed it last year . 
  well , that 's not so complicated ... 
  here in ulm , we also have communal elections the same day , and these are the ballots : http://imgur.com/umq3mdi you have 40 votes you can distribute as you like to all parties and to make it even more complicated every candidate can recieve 1 , 2 or 3 votes . 
  luckily you can just throw one of those sheets empty into the urn to give everyone on it 1 vote . 
  oh did n't realize that was today , and since i 'm sick and do n't have anything else to do , i think i 'll watch . 
  me too , german who got german , my closest soulmates are in austria and czech republic . 
  to top that i 'm a bavarian , austria and czech republic are our direct neighbours ( together with a little tiny bit of switzerland ), 
  a klingon learning german but mixing english in it when he has a brainfart , but the great thing about dutch is , as a german i can read it and understand 90 % without speaking dutch at all . 
  listening is another thing though . 
  there is a party ban ( [ tanzverbot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dancing_ban#legal_bans ) ) in germany , at least in the catholic majority states . 
  edit : haha , i just realized that 's the reason why today rtl ca n't send [ `` let 's dance '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/let%27s_dance_%28german_tv_series%29 ) today . 
  we germans make serious jokes, 
  the fact that the us has an area of 9.8 mio km \u00b2 and 320ish million in population while the eu has 4.8 mio km \u00b2 and a 500ish million population may also play a role here, 
  if one side fucks up , people go on the other side until they fuck up, 
  as a german , i can fully understand you . 
  thanks for looking that up for me , the 10 % came from a documentation i saw , but now i think it was that one 's companies percentage of exports not germany 's, 
  sure i see that , but when germany can not export goods to russia , which is something like 10 % of overall exports and depends on gas imports i do n't see how bad relations or sanctions strengthen germany even if germany gets europe to do nothing , it just stays where it 's at , and being dependend on russia is not a strenth in keeping others from sanctioning them , it 's a weakness since you have to come to an agreement with nations that do n't need russia as much as germany, 
  can someone explain to me how being dependent on russian gas strengthens germany ? 
  never said it was ok , it 's only ok if both parties are ok with it, 
   the article does the exact opposite . 
  the article ... yes . 
  you though do n't or at least do n't seem to care . 
   every time anyone tries to discuss the far right problem in ukraine , which is worth talking about there 's someone who feels he must go full retard and regurgitate `` so what putin this putin that '' . 
  getting annexed by russia is not independence, 
  kosovo became independent , crimea joins russian federation , one is a split of a sovereign state into two , the other one is an annexation . 
  guess what , that 's right , there are bad guys in the ukrainian parliament , just like muslim extremists took advantage of the arab spring revolutions , and we have to talk about it but there is not just black and white , what is worse , having extremists in your parliament or having a foreign power taking parts of your sovereign territory , potentially leading to an open war yes we have to get rid of destructive forces like ultra rights , but you just ca n't say `` there are bad guys in the ukrainian governemnet '' and then silently imply `` so i guess it 's ok that russia invades '' ( and as i pointed out originally , there are lot 's of parliaments with far right or far left or extreme libertarians , fundamentalist religious etc. 
  and we do n't think it 's a reason to send troops to denmark , greece , portugal or tunisia , so why would it be ok for russia to do so ? ), 
  i just pointed that out , if you do n't like it , downvote me but judging by your comments , you are the kind of person who always gets into the face of others for doing simple little things you personally do n't like starting fights whenever you can , instead of first thinking , then talking , believe me it works .
