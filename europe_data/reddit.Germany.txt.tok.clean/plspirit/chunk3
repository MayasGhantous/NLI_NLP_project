  i prefer to eat cucumbers , thanks . 
  i believe i wanted to answer someone , you make a little mistake and the internet explodes , no reason to call me a fucking moron some guys take this whole thing way too serious , i want to talk about that topic , not just what words were used or not in the linked article , apparently i do n't understand reddit i 'm not here to critique articles i 'm here to discuss the crimea crisis, 
  does it have to be in the article ? 
  i referred to what happens out there , and if you call it an invasion or a political trick does n't really matter, 
  so what , having dicks in government does n't justify an invasion , i ca n't remember any european country invading greece for having golden dwan members in parliament, 
  what are the eps plans on net neutrality , censorship , digital patents and copyright issues , and what is the green parties ' stance on it . 
  and when will there be finally a stop on listening to conservative religious people when it comes to science and education , i particulary think about stem cell research , artificial fertilization , preimplantation diagnostics , genetically altered organism etc. 
  are there plans to make scientific research results accessible to anyone soon ? 
  i have a hard time doing my work with all the subscriptions that are required for getting papers from for example jstor ( developing nations get free access to those journals , it 's easier to get a paper in bogota than in munich ) not a question , but i wish the eu and my country germany to have more focus on science and education . 
  education should be number one priority in the budget , and cut only if actual lives depend on it . 
  it 's our future !, 
  but it 's also totally normal to say `` ich setz mich an den rechner '' or `` geh ins netz '' , handy is n't even an english word , and i never heard someone use the word operator outside of it or when talking about 1950ies telephone operators things like sorry , fuck and bullshit are very common , but those are around for a long time, 
  since 1990 ? 
  many of those words were used long before that , i guess it has something to do with american and british soldiers stationed all over west germany after ww2 ... just a thought, 
  if the appeal fails and the judgement is enacted he will go to the landau prison, 
  another thing we do better than the americans, 
  f *** ing david hasslehoff again !, 
  yeah we liked knight rider back in the 80ies , but we never liked the hoff more than anyone else , and him singing when the wall fell does n't make it better , the true hymn of reunification is `` winds of change '' from `` the scorpions '', 
  hm cargolifter failed with a project like that in 2002 , the airship they planned would have been 61m in diameter and 87m long the construction hangar is now a tropical island holiday park, 
  is n't that what the eu is all about ? 
  helping each other , and those who have nobody to help them ? 
   the eu is to blame for many problems in european countries , and many people have no choice but to turn to the far-right parties and reject the over-bureaucratic and undemocratic eu , danish member of the european parliament , morten messerschmidt , told rt. 
  stopped after reading that , that 's just utter bullshit, 
  and there it is , the ad hominem `` argument '' think what you want , i read that article blame it on the bbc then that they concluded he 's blaming germany , i guess they asked those people though , if not the bbc pulled those lines out of their ass and the article is worth nothing, 
  those word written in italics below the names gave it away ? 
   to suggest that germany 's participation to the war was restricted to maintaining a defence treaty is absolute historical revisionism the war went on for 4 years , i 'm talking about the start , i 'm not trying to change germany 's role in the war or anything else i only find it ridiculous to blame germany for ** starting ** the war when it was a conflict between serbia and austria which ignited the spark , you can blame germany and russia if you like for steering this conflict to a much larger war , but they are not to blame for starting it to come back on my initial post , the irak and kuwait were in conflict , the us decided to help kuwait , if then iran israel europe and whatever , china , joined in leading to ww3 , would it be the us who started it ? 
  no , similar situation ... just a reminder  world war one : 10 interpretations of who started ww1 is the topic we are talking about , i complained about the opinion of sir max hastings , not more not less , in my opinion austria-hungary and serbia , germany and russia are the ones who started the war , in that order of importance blaming solely germany is not just unfair it 's plain wrong ( same for only blaming serbia or russia like some other opinions in that article suggested ), 
  i 'm fine with germany taking the blame for bloating that conflict to a europe wide war , but that 's not the point i originally made, 
  that did n't start the war, 
  sure , i never denied some repsonibility , just as all other parties bear some resposibility, 
  then take the brits or russia or japan or italy, 
  yet he still comes to the conclusion it 's mainly germany 's fault, 
  same for american participation in ww2 etc. 
  so if you go to your dad and ask him if you should kill the bully you currently have to deal with and your dad says , yeah sure , it 's your dads fault you killed the bully ? 
  ( sure he will get in trouble but he 's by no means the main perpetrator ), 
   no one nation deserves all responsibility for the outbreak of war , but germany seems to me to deserve most . 
   it alone had power to halt the descent to disaster at any time in july 1914 by withdrawing its `` blank cheque '' which offered support to austria for its invasion of serbia . 
  what ? 
  how can a country be more at fault for not breaking a treaty than the two countries actually starting the fight ? 
  by that logic britain and russia are to blame for ww2 , they just could n't have helped france and let hitler take poland and france . 
  or the us is at fault for the first gulf war for helping kuwait . 
  25 years old ? 
  there 's propably only fishbones left . 
  not present day germany at least, 
  [ wer fr\u00fcher stirbt is l\u00e4nger tot ] ( http://www.watchever.de/filme/wer-frueher-stirbt-ist-laenger-tot-245331?gclid=cppu6phyvrwcfujitaod418a0w ) pretty much hits the nail for alpine regions of germany, 
  i just wanted to point out that it makes no sense to pull some date from somewhere and say `` but then it was xyz '' by that logic you can assign half of europe to pretty much any state you want , just pick the date that suits you, 
  and was founded by germans in the 13th century, 
  yeah pretty much , not the sausage , just sausage but what a stupid name, 
  the times of mass invasions are over anyways, 
  is n't it the `` others '' fault for german military reluctancy ? 
  after ww2 they were all afraid germany could rise to power again , artificially keeping the bundeswher small , and now they complain after 50 + years of suspicion that the germans do n't really like to fight anymore ? 
  in useless fights only benefitting us contractors and oil firms ) it would be better to have a euro force if any military intervention is necessary ( and i argue in most cases it 's not ), 
  i never met one , but there must be at least a few somewhere ( i 'm from south germany ) the closest may have been some jehovas witnesses i heard of creationism the first time during my biology bachelor, 
  maybe we do n't use the term indoctrination the same way , for me indoctrination is something done to you ( you are passive ) being a communist , in any way you want to define it ) is something what you do/are ( you are active ) while the first one can be true and generalized ( i 'm aware some people are still exempt due to being in a coma or mentally ill etc. 
  ) , the second can not, 
   does it mean subscribing to their general ideals ? 
  this, 
  it does n't ? 
  i just responded to  wow , you manage to blame it on the dirty reds when the wall fell 20 years ago . 
  and apparently nobody seems to care i also mention corruption , and only focuses on communism, 
   `` everyone that lived in germany in the 30 's remained a nazi for the rest of their lives '' or `` everyone above 30 has been indoctrinated by almost 50 years of communism '' that 's just not the same , first not everyone was a nazi even during the nazi period , being a nazi and being indoctrinated by nazi propaganda is also not the same , but it is a fact that everyone living in germany at that time was exposed to nazi propaganda , and that had an effect on people , in whatever way ( and those being nazis did n't stop being nazis the moment ww2 ended either ) you just equated everyone going to school has math classes with everyone having math classes becomes a mathematician, 
  so the past of a country/culture does n't influence the present ? 
  who is ignorant here ? 
  you did n't understand me , and i did n't articulate that too well , sorry what i meant is , in communism the state is responsible , not individuals , the communist citizen has no need to take responsibility because everything is a state plan and this has influenced culture in those ex communist countries, 
  indeed , i think corruption is next to climate change and religious conflicts the biggest challenge humans have to face today just look how legalized bribery changed us politics in the last 30 years, 
  you could even argue it was n't `` real '' communism since a political elite ruled and corruption was very prevalent , yes it was communism for the `` normal '' people and an oligarchy for the elite , pretty much how many south american and african states have/had communist dictators, 
  i did n't say nothing changed , a lot changed , there is no communist regime to get things running for one anymore , then there is corruption , a lot of corruption ( but that 's been propably there before ) there is no `` enemy '' anymore to outproduce/tech/smart and then is there the point that although the soviet union made an impression to the outside world it was technologically advanced it really invested a lot in few prestige projects like the space race and nuclear power/h-bomb , the rest of the country was slowly decaying and in fact was close to a total breakdown in the late 80ies otherwise the german reunification and the political end of the soviet communism would n't have happened when it happened ** edit : ** oh and you had to wait 17 years for a car in east germany , not so succesful if you ask me, 
  i did n't say that , those were two seperate points, 
  my point is people do n't change over night just because there is something happening i do n't say everywhere where once communism ruled , nothing ever gets done again , but is say an upbringing in a communistic society impacts society to this day, 
  well everyone above 30 has been indoctrinated by almost 50 years of communism , people did n't just forget their upbringing when the wall fell, 
  do they know the titanic is a satire magazine ? 
  that 's the main problem of communism ( or the remnants of it ) , nobody is responsible so nothing gets done and then there 's corruption, 
  not that i know , but i experienced it in costa rica, 
  i do n't care for geographic location , what counts is the mind set , and the willingness to work for a better future inside a union, 
   i have no idea what actually is going through the head of people . 
  that is one of humankinds greatest mysteries, 
  well i at least know as much as greenland was green when the vikings/danes discovered it , it was during a medieval warm period, 
  why is iceland green ? 
  all i know of iceland is snow , lava fields and mingy yellow grass , but i 'm ready to learn, 
  i do n't defend him i just find a petition ridiculous, 
  fair point, 
  that 's interesting , i do n't collect but here in south germany i almost never see belgian or dutch coins , most `` foreign '' coins are austrian followed by italian and french, 
  funny how that is a thing , people have biases deal with it , i do n't like lanz too much either but that 's kind of a joke what about the 80 % of people on tv hating on bavaria ? 
  the 95 % hating on the csu ? 
  that seems to be no problem ... it 's a talkshow not a news broadcast, 
   what is the reason for this difference between german and other european media ? 
  the feeling of getting the blame for everything ? 
  it 's not the fact he was a `` serb '' but the fact he was not german and had nothing to do with germany which is pointed out by focusing on him being a `` serb '' . 
  germany would be the dapper nerd nobody likes but everyone asks if they 're stuck with their homework . 
  by the bad thing i meant `` not acting american enough '' not `` not having religious nuts and corruption in the parliament '', 
  sure , as if being conquered by the nazis somehow bonds you to them . 
  i 'm german and guess what , in france you get just as often reminded of your countries history than in britain . 
  in poland it 's even worse , most times they do n't say something but you can feel them acting diferently when they find out you 're german . 
  can we please get on and stop that shit ? 
  i 'm not responsible for what my grand parents neighbours did 75 years ago , my own grand father had to hide in an earth hole for several weeks because he was in the resistance and my other grandfathers whole achievement during the war was getting shot in the shoulder and sent home 6 days prior to stalingrad . 
  european as european you can get , they just do n't want to disavow it yet , anymore or whatever . 
  ( hell your royals are half germans ) political , they try to be americans but are not quite so corrupt and religiously influenced like the americans are , and somehow act as if that was a bad thing . 
  thanks , that made sense . 
  how does that benefit germany then ? 
   monetary union that helped germany and hindered some of the other nations can you explain that ?
