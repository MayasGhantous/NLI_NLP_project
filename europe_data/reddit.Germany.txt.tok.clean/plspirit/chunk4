  i hear that all the time but i do n't know how that would apply , or why it is like that . 
  was n't it so that those states that now need bailouts took loans way over their capacity ? 
  is n't that a national decision ? 
  and why would a german selling a car to greece profit more from the monetary union than a greek selling a car to germany ? 
  when they realize their empire is gone , they might be glad to have europe , i 've not given up hope, 
  i bet there are people in this world if you ask them if they feel as a world citizen they would say no . 
  is n't stromae belgian ? 
  i think it 's petty jealousy, 
  db is privatized ( technically ) since 1994, 
  that happens when politicians are in charge of such projects and not engineers and architects, 
  dito , in fact my town ( ulm , 120k inhabitants without neu-ulm ) got part of the city center totally renewed , there are several million euro projects for new homes , we get a new tram line and a whole new district attached to it , the existing tram was extended and modernized the autobahn to munich is getting a third lane and the railway to stuttgart is modernized with the stuttgart 21 project seems to be a phenomenon in american and uk media to write doomsday prophecies for germany lately, 
   but beer consumption in germany is actually falling , and some people say that is due to strict laws which limit the ingredients brewers can use . 
  where the problem , just do n't call it beer then , drinks like that already exist in germany . 
  so i 'm worried because i 'm a scientist i guess ... 
  i 'm a bit concerned that so few people see the environment and energy as a future problem , that might be the largest and hardest task we have to stem as humans in our ~ 2 million year history . 
  well it was a thing when i was at school , in the early nineties, 
  as a south german i 'm safe to say we make fun of ostfriesen ( north germans ) and austrians, 
   survey shows it is the third consecutive time we have topped our european neighbours i hate that !, 
  they talk about a survey and do n't have a link to it ... 
  criminalizing it is just as stupid as the prohibition was . 
  1 . it does n't work 2 . it makes things worse for everyone involved , customers , sexworkers and the authorities who have to prosecute them what you need is regulations which are enforced, 
  those numbers are greater metropolitan regions ? 
  no , i just made a general statement , was n't even talking about the military, 
  if it were n't so freaking hard to get your research projects funded , maybe we would n't need to take money from non-ethical sources, 
  yeah and then the pasta is in the water and the oil on the water , never ever touching until you pour the pasta out and then that 's a good way to prevent your pasta from taking up the sauce , so it totally makes sense ... not !, 
  i do n't know who came up with this but somehow it got stuck in peoples heads, 
  i once had a roommate who made a `` pasta sauce '' by mixing cream cheese with ketchup . 
  to be honest i have a problem with honour , honour is worth nothing and leads people to do stupid things , what you actually need is altruism , empathy , politenes and decency people kill to keep their honour , they shun their children for honour and hide their true feelings just not to lose their honour, 
  they wanted to come , there were also a lot of spanish portuguese and italian guest workers , but the spanish , greek and portuguese went back home after working in germany for a few years , italian and turkish guest workers stayed . 
   `` would you sleep with someone who is n't circumcized ? '', 
  i was 14 and had just arrived at a party thrown by my friend marie , and this was one of the first questions of the evening . 
  others followed : `` are you allowed to have a german boyfriend ? 
  does your father talk to you about sex ? 
  would n't you at least like to try a bit of the pork , after all ? '', 
  new people , old questions . 
  so guess what , if there was n't such a focus on these things in part of the turkish community ( and i blame it on islam not being turkish ) nobody would ask those questions . 
  as with all prejudices they have a little truth in core . 
  like mothers complaining to school authorities that their daughter has to take part in swimming classes . 
  and guess what , when i tell people i 'm from munich they ask stupid questions about being bavarian . 
  yes learning from past mistakes is usually a good thing, 
  so i defined `` doing well '' ? 
  oh please do n't pull stuff out of nowhere , doing well does n't mean winning in any context i know so please do n't put words in my mouth in the second part i tried to emphasize the point that germany is doing well by manufacturing and not creating money out of nothing like britain or the us and no it does n't mean putting another one in a debt , it just means an exchange of goods , if you buy somethign from a supermarket you do n't go into debt !, 
  first you get a product and second you only go into debt if you spend more than you have and third nobody forces you to buy something, 
   in your previous comment you discussed production as if it 's a game that some countries are winning and some countries are losing . 
  not that i can remember , where did i ? 
  i was only ranting about those who do see it as a game or something and now are butthurt about `` losing '' and thus writing those bullshit articles, 
  give up ? 
  i think we gain by unity , i think we should have one world government , if anything worked the eu was designed to bring peace in europe if we ever want to get to a type 1 civilization we need to set aside our petty squabbles , abolish religion and put massive amounts of funding into education world wide i know this is utopian , i even think we should abolish money , ( switzerland is making a step in that direction by discussing a conditionless minimum wage of 2000 sfr ) i 'd rather live in a star trek like world than in a world dominating germany , even as a german , even if i had a good position in it edit : there a basically only ** 3 problems ** on this world that are cause or linked to every other problem we have : ** stock markets ** ( and by that i mean trading things that do n't exist , betting on the future , trading trades etc. 
  stick to trading real things and stop creating money or value out of nothing at the cost of the poor and by doing so putting profit over well being , destroying the environment and peoples lifes ) , ** disease ** ( pretty much self explaining ) and ** religion ** ( religions are the number 1 reason for hating an outgroup , there are no outgroups , we are all humans ), 
   want to be a hegemonic power , a `` world leader '' as you put it ? 
  in that case , you have to at least give something away to your `` subjects '' . 
  just to be clear , i never said somethign like that , i said the others are afraid of that , because of what happened in the 1930ies , and i said that is bullshit , not more or less we rather see a democratic united states of europe than a new hegemonic germany ( but still there will be some brit who will call the use a grand germany in disguise or some crap ), 
  and germany does n't pay billions to other european states now ? 
  i do n't only talk of the bailouts , britain has the 2nd or third largest gdp in europe and guess what they do ? 
  thatcher somehow managed it to get all benefits from europe but avoided till this day to pay for anything germany and france are the ones paying for the rest of europe , so please do n't come with a whole other situation like ww2 80 % of the infrastructure was bombed to pieces by the brits and americans in west germany , and i am damn well grateful for the help the marshall plan and the berlin air bridge  fucking mercantilists thinking this is a game and whoever has the most exports is winning . 
  yeah exactly my problem , they are the mercantilists who think omg the do well how can that be there must be something wrong it 's them not us who have that stupid thinking that 's why something like lehman happened what the hell is wrong with people who say it is a danger if someone is doing well ? 
  pure jealousy , pure stock market bullshit , how can it be bad to make good money by manufacturing goods like cars power plants car parts laboratory equipment and such ? 
  sure we also have some predatory businesses with the american model i for example think patents on medicine is bullshit and we have some very strong pharma here in germany , and there are also the walmart like retailers who exploit their workers with a minimum wage and make billions , i also think that 's wrong and then there are banks, 
  all i read is mimimi they do better than we do this has to stop , i 'm sure this has absoooluutely nothing to do with an irrational fear of germany becoming a world leader by declaring the forth reich or some shit, 
  in some cases you can , that 's all i say , hell in same cases you have to . 
  it works ( mostly ) for the geneva conventions and the ban of bio and chem weapons , why not for destroying the world we live in and need to survive ? 
  and yes plastic in the oceans is a huge problem, 
  so nobody throws their plastic bags just away ? 
  never ? 
  every norwegian is a poster child citizen ? 
  paper bags are not the only alternative , i use a fabric bag for my groceries which i reuse every time and just because it works for norway does n't mean it also works for greece or poland, 
  does n't every municipality determine their own tax rate in switzerland ? 
  i was a few years ago in luzern and they told me there that nearby is a village where all the millionaires have aregistered residence because it has a 0 % tax rate, 
  no value added tax in this chart ? 
  so it 's just the tax you pay directly via your paycheck ? 
  but those are the issues that do n't stop at a border , how much parking tickets cost in strasbourg does n't affect a citizen of frankfurt , but if italians throw millions of plastic bags all over the place , esp into the adriatic , the croatians are concerned i think there are some issues that should be treated at the highest level possible , including environment energy and finances , we all share the oceans and atmosphere , we all depend on the world markets so please do n't let everyone do what they want on those levels oh and please do n't tell me some countries get a huge problem when not using throw away plastic bags anymore , or your life will drastically change, 
  i see articles from the spiegel or el pais for example frequently in this sub , do n't tell me those countries do n't have international media, 
  i would even prefer if there was a world wide institution that could push that , sometimes you need a central organ to do something or it will never get done in a few parts of the world you could also ask why a federal government is needed when you have a municipal government that can form their own policies, 
  is n't the standard model of blame something like : oh it was `` the others '' ? 
  i find it suspicious that those articles almost exclusively come from american or british writers , i myself have no idea if that is true , but if it is , and it 's a problem for the eurozone ( not the us or uk as i suspect is the reason for those articles ) why is n't france poland or italy complaining ? 
  but we still have the plastic bags for fruits and vegetables in super markets and every clothing store gives you a free plastic bag when you buy something, 
  why would that matter to you ? 
  yup , just in an older fashioned way, 
  nope , we call them mohrenkopf, 
  oh i was last year in costa rica , and i love guanabana ( the fruit ) , unfortunately we do n't get it here in germany, 
  i was born 1981 in munich , we played a lot of hide and seek , fetch and a hide and seek variation where you tried to jumpscare the seeker a bit later when i was a teen ~ 12 , 13 i started playing pc games and a lot of magic the gathering , and that was where most of my money went , magic , legos and comic books , later computers ** early childhood memories : ** adventskalender and lebkuchen , when my mother was pregnant with my brother , i had a nanny who crafted a custom advent calender for me , with little bags you could fill with sweets and stuff the days before christmas were always very exciting and gem\u00fctlich the lebkuchen story is different , when i was ~ 3 i had an operation in the hospital , and when my dad took me and my mom home he brought a box of lebkuchen with him , were my first , and this is still one of my first memories i have also the oktoberfest , or wiesn as we call it was a yearly highlight, 
  english version : http://www.bmwi.de/en/topics/europe/majority-calculator.html, 
  how many terrorist did they get by spaying on us ? 
  they did n't even catch the boy who shot two us army soldiers in frankfurt and he was talking about it and clearly radicalized himself on facebook for everyone to read 6 months before the deed, 
  sure why not , i was born and live in germany , but i totally could imagine living elsewhere . 
  i was in central america for some project last year , costa rica to be exact , i just loved how relaxed and friendly most people were . 
  within europe i can imagine living anywhere , no big deal , but i might come back to germany after a while . 
  brand is so right in many point , but one . 
  not voting only `` helps '' if enough , like 50 % of eligable voters use it as a tool to express their discontent with current politics , otherwise fringe groups that can motivate their loonie followers to vote get to play a much larger than they deserve which may not be true in the british and american 2 party systems , yes they have more than two parties in theory , but in reality nobody really votes for them all in all i think it 's better to vote for a small party that may fall through the roster than not voting , just to make a statement which has a direction , not just a bugger all and ride off into the sunset, 
  value wise , not volume wise though those stats are numbers not values though, 
  that was my initial reason not to install it in the first place , i have the feeling we germans are espescially sensitive in these regards, 
  cheers neighbour !, 
  thanks for all your answers, 
  as a firefox user from germany , that has never tried using chrome , can someone explain to me why i should/would prefer chrome over firefox ? 
  there are two things on earth we have to get rid of : religion and lobbyists, 
  haha , that would be actually kind of funny , from mr. universe to terminator to governator to presinator ? 
  well politically i 'm not convinced , for comic relief ? 
  imagine him at a un congress blasting out one liners actually that reminds me of saints row 4, 
  while i 'm glad that those refugees get help , i think a camp is the most idiotic idea possible , esp . 
  when for longer term commodation spread them out over the country , integration is much easier , for the refugees and their neighbours , because they do n't get separated from society sure it may be harder to get into the new situation when you have no familiar groups around you , but that also means you have to do something to get around and not just sit in an internment camp like structure also you mitigate the feeling of estangement of the local people , it 's a huge difference if you get a container camp with 5000 refugees right around your corner from maybe 1-3 families i , for example , would n't consider walking to a refugee camp , but i would gladly welcome new neighbours and help out finding places to shop and official buildings , learn the language and just be well a neighbour,
