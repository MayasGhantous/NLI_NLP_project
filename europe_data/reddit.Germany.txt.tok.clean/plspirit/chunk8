  what ? 
  they were kinda right about the north sea part west of denmark though , large parts sank into the sea after a flood in 1362 , the ruins of [ rungholt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rungholt ) were found there . 
  a second flood swallow the island [ strand ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strand_%28island%29 ) in 1634 [ reconstruction of 13th century north frisian coast ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordfriesische_inseln#/media/file:nordfriesische_k%c3%bcste_13._jh..jpg ) how it [ looks now ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordfriesische_inseln#/media/file:nordfries-inseln.png ), 
  lol lafontaine, 
  controversy sells , that does n't mean everyone buying the book agrees with the writer, 
  education just is n't what it used to be - sincerely a 33 yr old grandpa, 
  i hope the internet is also considered , we need fiber and better mobile networks, 
  was n't there a thread how great hungary ( and iceland which is not on the graph ) was doing compared to the euro countries netherlands finland and denmark ? 
  or 3 , prince , regent and prime minister, 
  usually at least one person in the background is a bit smarter, 
  liechtenstein pop . 
  ~ 37k , 1900/1000000 = 0.19 % -  70 people filed a request, 
  that 's another thing , this is only the `` right to be forgotten '' thing, 
  are they really believing that someone planning to attack a refugee home does n't know how to find one ? 
  how about columbia that college where matress girl happened and brown ? 
  or oxford ? 
  northwestern , smith , oberlin and the rolling stone case ? 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/opinion/sunday/judith-shulevitz-hiding-from-scary-ideas.html or ucla http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/christina-hoff-sommers-talk-at-ucla-to-be-boycotted/ gender studies craziness is everywhere , you might not see it as an engineering student , but almost every college has at least one group fighting for those so called social justice issues, 
  http://www.thesocialmemo.org/2015/06/univ-of-wi-releases-list-of.html this stuff is all over campuses in the us, 
  the whole point of literature is , next to simple entertainment , to make the reader think . 
  american campuses are afraid of thinking students . 
  this wo n't end well ( and we are always stupid enough to mimick what americans do , so expect this crap to spread ), 
  only berlin is proud to be poor , and by that they meant the city not the people there . 
  berlin is a black hole sucking up all finanzausgleich money . 
   what will it take to convince you the euro has failed most euro countries ? 
  why would i need to be convinced ? 
  and why does it matter ? 
  and still twice as wealthy as hungary , how did china have all those years those amazingly high growth numbers ? 
  because it had a lot of room to grow . 
  that 's my argument it 's like a spring that needs more and more force the further it is pushed in, 
  context ? 
  if i have 5 $ it 's pretty easy to earn 5 $ more to double my wealth , if i have 50000 $ it takes some effort to earn 50000 $ more . 
  last time i checked the netherlands ( and denmark ? ), 
  had gdps per capita higher than germany france and uk . 
  hungary is somewhere between the bahamans , greece and kazakhstan . 
  half of the green party are kinda conservatives with a focus on economy and environment , sustainability and green tech etc. 
  and the rest is a bunch of identity politics eco-terrorist leftists ( really left ) , the kind chaining themselves on train tracks or throwing stones on demos , i call them krawallhippies too bad i 'd vote green if it were n't for those guys , we do pretty well with kretschmer in bw ( only thing that comes to mind when thinking of stupidity is the ban of alcohol sales after 22:00 in supermarkets , gas stations etc. 
  ** edit : ** to be fair the original ban was introduced under the cdu but they now expanded it to delivery services and vending machines ), 
  but not all of them are sexy, 
  fine keep believing that , so it 's easier to pass on blame onto others, 
  it 's still a consensus , germany ca n't just dictate , if you believe that you are delusional, 
  he tried to kill hitler and did n't succeed , he did n't try to enslave poland . 
  still different . 
  during that time many now celebrated people were anti-semites or racists , or by our standards crazy nationalists , radical communists and so on , but they did n't act on it or did something else they are now praised for this is like tim hunt , he won a nobel prise , is a celebrated scientists , but he said something stupid about women , so he is a bad man and all his good is undone , nobody wants to associate with him and so on . 
  best example is [ churchill ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html ) you understand where i 'm going there ? 
  why am i not surprised i get downvoted for stating a fact and implying thought crimes do not exist . 
  but germany can do whatever they want without consent of france italy and all the others ? 
  sorry that 's not how it works , europe is not dictated by germany without anyone else having a say . 
  doing something and wanting something are still different things , in the end we are judged by our deeds not thoughts, 
  sure , austria belgium cyprus estonia finland france ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg malta netherlands portugal slovakia slovenia and spain have nothing to say at all ... 
  exactly , germany is not europe and europe is not germany , we are just part of something bigger , i 'm sick of everyone acting like all responsibility and blame lies with germany, 
  is germany ? 
   of course the german transfer union is n't popular with everyone either and if you look what berlin for example does with all the billions they get ( cough airport ) you have all right to be a bit grumpy, 
  but we are not living in a predominantly buddhist region ... i was trying to make a point how big of a deal this is , by relating it to us, 
  why not ? 
  it 's how humans do science . 
  you imagine a situation and try to predict the outcome , then maybe compare it to another situation that happened and then you learn something from it . 
  guess why i use the word `` imagine '', 
  they do n't , that 's my point, 
  imagine 80 churches were shut down after the breivik attack for preaching violence . 
  teach everything to everyone , anyone making an argument to not teaching parts of history to parts of the population is crazy . 
  1984 anyone ? 
  no people being idiots or insensitive about the taught material is no excuse !, 
  and schw\u00f6rmontag and / r/ulmgonewild, 
  yes , but i think only if you count only buldings , meaning leave out the eiffel tower and the washington monument i think it surpassed the cologne cathedral 2 or 3 years after it was built by 4 meters and is still the highest church tower in the world not sure about lincoln cathedral edit : just looked it up , you 're right it was the first to surpass lincoln cathedral , but apparently lincoln cathedral 's spire collapsed at some point so there were other churches `` higher '' in the mean time https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_tallest_buildings_in_the_world#churches_and_cathedrals, 
  yes where are the silesian , bohemian , bavarian , tyrolian , allg\u00e4uerisch , swiss german , carinthian , k\u00f6lsch , flemish etc. 
  i 'm from munich and i live in ulm , and i ca n't sometimes understand some people from vorarlberg or allg\u00e4u ( which is only 1hrs drive away ), 
  quaste, 
  it makes sense in a weird way , the road leads to an intersection which has traffic lights , you ca n't just leave one road without a light , even if you 're only allowed to turn right there and technically do n't need a light . 
  i think all religions are a threat to progress and peace . 
  opposing the eu ? 
  putting nukes everywhere ? 
   more than half of germans , italians , and french are opposed to using military force that 's more accurate, 
  i think swabians still have it worse there , but true , it 's all envy though , 
  bretagne , http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%a9rity was there in the late 90s, 
  the prostitute thing is also applicable to hamburg, 
  oh italy ... there is a small road , barely wide enough for 2 cars leading from venice to jesolo , 70 kph is allowed there , i was going 110 ( trying to fit in ) still got overtaken by a 20 year old fiat going at least 130 ( pretty sure that was the maximum this thing was able to reach ), 
  you mean the winters less cold and the weather unpredictable, 
  i call that capitalitis , somehow people in a countries capital are always the most rude , berlin is also infamous for this , especially in bavaria, 
  the toilets in france , they really had some of those [ `` put feet here , aim at hole in the ground '' ] ( http://images.travelpod.com/tripwow/photos/ta-009a-bbc4-7e9b/old-men-s-room-toilet-kiten-bulgaria+12807169594-tpfil02aw-12535.jpg ) toilets, 
  the cheap planes are deceptive , you can travel for 30 $ to london from pretty much anywhere in europe , but you have to pay for some airport fees extra , use remote airports which cost you an hour to get out there and another 30 + $ for the bus/train there, 
  and they do n't have to go across the mittelgebirge , the schw\u00e4bische alb and the alps the reason why augsburg nuremberg is so slow and the reason the planned highspeed between stuttgart and ulm is so expensive , and the reason why stuttgart/munich/nuremberg have relatively bad connections to the east and south a bit strange they did n't include munich which is the hub to northern italy , czech republic and austria and hungary and has as much passengers daily ( about half a million ) as frankfurt and hamburg ( the top 3 in germany ), 
  new york must be a horrible place . 
  diversity itself does nothing , the people being part of the diverse groups have to enrich the culture with their own , without destroying the original culture . 
  having a libanese pizza place next door is nice , having the libanese mafia is not . 
  here 's one found in munich about 3 years ago in the middle of one of the more expensive inner city parts https://vimeo.com/48399328 2 houses caught fire and several windows broke , 2000 evacuated bomb was `` just '' a 125kg one, 
  how so ? 
  did you get one made from instant powder ? 
  we usually make mash out of fresh potatoes , milk a ton of butter and salt and nutmeg, 
  it 's a nazi joke, 
  the gays love it , have huge open air viewing with stages and live events , the rest of the population feels the urge to watch to not be left out of conversations . 
  most people think it 's a balkan conspiracy anyways and we do n't have a chance of winning . 
  that changed a bit with lena though . 
  railjet is 4 hrs from vienna to munich , that 's not that bad considering you have to go over the alps , by car i 'm also needing easy 4-5hrs munich to vienna, 
  and austria , hungary and switzerland, 
  ultimately all our goal should be a united world , i think this is the only secure way to ensure the survival of humanity in the long run . 
  starting with europe would be a first step, 
  are we picky ? 
  if yes , the country i currently live in technically only exists since 1990 . 
  and then it 's clearly the reunification .
