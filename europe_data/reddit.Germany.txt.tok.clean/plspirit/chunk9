  if we take all forms of germany , take your pick , 
  what an idiot , so he does n't use a credit card , a bank account , a social security or tax number , he does n't provide any useful information via email or telephone and on and on . 
  it is easier , and more consistent , but people like me who learned the old one during elementary school and needed to write the new one in highschool but never learned it in school kinda hate it there are cases i do n't know still how something is written, 
  no it 's a more silent grumpy noise , not really angry, 
  that 's usually somewhat tied to average cost of living and average incomes , and of course variable currency exchange rates . 
  and sometimes they just arbitrary make 9,99 $ into 9,99 $ and 9,99 \u20a4, 
  you mean immigrants ? 
  why is it racist ? 
  immigrants often do n't have a good education and then bringing good results in a foreign language is not easy . 
  listen and believe , feels before facts . 
  is that what happened to sweden ? 
  gender studies 101 : redefine racism/sexism to `` prejudice and power '' claim you 're a minority , hence powerless . 
  profit : you ca n't be racist/sexist . 
  and we all know it 's bullshit, 
  depends , the older stuff 800-1000 is [ romanic ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=romanische+kirche&amp;sa=x&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=bbfqvfj2piyisahv1igqca&amp;ved=0ccwq7ak&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=947#imgrc=_ ) , the 12th-14th century [ gothic ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=gothic+church&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=rrfqvfdxfogssaggjydacq&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=947#tbm=isch&amp;q=ulmer+m%c3%bcnster ) , 16th-17th century [ renaissance ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=deutsche+renaissance+architektur&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=drfqvblcj8uqsggbqocwag&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=947 ) and after that [ neoclassic ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=m%c3%bcnchen+neoklassik&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=vrfqvz-ieokjsghujidada&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=947#tbm=isch&amp;q=m%c3%bcnchen+staatsoper ) ( ancient roman greek inspired , king ludwig ii built a lot of these in munich ) and around 1900 many buildings were built in a [ neogothic ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=m%c3%bcnchen+neues+rathaus&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=bljqved4h4gssaggjydacq&amp;ved=0cagq_auoag&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=947 ) style throughout the time the [ timber-framing ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=fachwerkhaus&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=6bjqvbmcc4kxsahbgohgca&amp;ved=0cb0qsaq ) style was very common, 
  gerald or geralt is a northern german name , you might find some geralds in their mid 40-50s there, 
  add all double names especially the modern ones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d2gqwzj8k0 ( and most parents ca n't even spell those names after `` stealing '' them from other languages ) justin is my second most hated after kevin . 
  there are even studies showing that people named kevin have a harder time in life because of their name , it 's coined [ kevinism ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2012/02/01/does-a-lame-name-make-you-more-likely-to-be-a-smoker-with-low-self-esteem/ ), 
  [ rothenburg ob der tauber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rothenburg_ob_der_tauber#/media/file:rothenburg_bw_4.jpg ) is one i can instantly think of . 
  [ trier ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/trier_steipe_bw_0.jpg ) is another one . 
  we have a sizeable vietnamese immigrant number , vietnam is not one that surprises me, 
  they should have included germany as a choice , many bad decision were made from a strategic standpoint by the german leadership . 
  [ munich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich ) : a few monks built a small monastry on a hill near the isar ( the name is derived from `` zu den m\u00f6nchen '' `` to the monks '' ) , some people settled around it , when the settlement reached a reasonable size it got aristocracy and leaders . 
  one time one of these leader called [ heinrich der l\u00f6we ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_the_lion ) decided to burn down the bridge over the isar in the near freising ( which was the seat of a bishop and much larger than munich at the time , he kinda also did it to piss off the pope since his cousin [ kaiser barbarossa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frederick_i,_holy_roman_emperor ) was having a power struggle with him ) so he can collect customs for the salt traders coming from salzburg travelling to the kaiser 's realms . 
  munich got rich and became the capital of bavaria a few hundred years later . 
  that story happened around 1158 or so . 
  tl ; dr munich became rich and big because some saxon wanted to piss of the church and make a quick buck of salt . 
  so why is it so important that geert wilders is right-wing ? 
  i have the feeling right-wing is used to relativate the deed , somehow it 's less horrible if the `` other side '' is also `` evil '' no it 's completely irrelevant and there is no excuse , even if hitler was the main speaker there . 
  we have to stop regarding issues as right-wing vs left-wing vs. islam vs. atheist and so on . 
  look at issues on themselves , stop generalizing everything while at the same time complaining about generalization ( not all muslims are terrorists , stupid politically incorrect right-wingers ), 
  germany : it 's the [ commerzbank tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commerzbank_tower ) , 259m , with the antenna 300.1 m. 
  the highest structure is the [ berliner fernsehturm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_fernsehturm ) with 368m . 
  and the highest church is the [ ulmer m\u00fcnster ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulm_minster ) with 161.5 m it 's still the highest church in the world and was the tallest structure ever built before the 20th century . 
  i think the eiffer tower is not considered a building , like broadcasting towers and antennas etc. 
  social capitalism or social democracy is a capitalistic state form that has the basic philosophy of `` add enough regulation to capitalsim so that everybody has a social safety net '' or `` do n't let corporation get too powerful and dick people over . '', 
  it was derived from the unions . 
  make a 3 room to a 2 room and put the slider up to 500 and the whole of munich would still be red, 
  somehow i think those should n't be included in a suicide survey , pretty misleading, 
  speak fluently - german , obviously - english have learned at one point , i understand all of them well enough to read or have a small conversation to get by on a trip , not starve or get directions . 
  - french ( 5 years in school , but the teachers kinda ruined it ) - italian ( 1 year with exchange to rome , voluntary course at school ) - spanish ( 2 semesters at university ) languages i never learned but can get the sense of something by knowing languages similar - dutch - portuguese - fl\u00e4misch i wish my spanish was better and languages i like to understand are polish russian japanese and arabic, 
  imagine a german chancellor saying that about the holocaust . 
  oh my , forget everything i said today ... 
  oh right , on the left dark green is bad , on the right dark green is good ... well , i just got out of bed, 
  wtf ? 
  50 % + believe science is more harmful than beneficial in countries like germany and finland and norway ? 
  do they all think scientists are hollywood villains or what ? 
  edit : i 'm a moron and read it the wrong way round . 
  dammit , clicked on montenegro instead of kosovo . 
  well done !, 
  your score : 97 % 01:41, 
  but do people really know them ? 
  i mean ok , there are quite some monarchies around us , like denmark sweden the netherlands spain norway and britain ( and maybe i forgot one or two ) i suspect this is the most likely explanation , people know england is a monarchy so they assume it 's like that in europe everywhere, 
  they hold no power , only empty titles , the monarchy died 1918, 
  was asked if we 're still a monarchy by an american . 
  can i kidnap christoph walz , as a bavarian ? 
  wait a minute , why do half those things sound like german ? 
  krem\u0161nita = kremschnitte fritule = frittierte ( fryed ) gemi\u0161t = gemischt ( we call it weinschorle , gemischt means just mixed ) \u0160trukli = strudel, 
  looks like mittenwald, 
  i give them tailgating and people not knowing how good/bad they are at driving . 
  yet somehow i feared for my life when driving in italy , costa rica and the us , while i do not in germany . 
   disdain for the people in the east is an integral part of german culture . 
  are you insane ? 
  and many germans have polish ancestors and vice versa . 
  how can you argue for geo-locking ? 
  all it does is increase piracy . 
  people watch what they want anyways . 
  and i for example do n't want to wait a year until i can watch the latest game of thrones , or have to use a vpn to watch top gear . 
  if anything it increases diversity because we do n't only get the already successful american blockbusters , no i can watch british series or french or more niche american stuff . 
  i want to decide what 's worthless for myself , thanks . 
  you should definitly spend a few days in munich , there are several areas in and close to munich not overrun with tourists , if you avoid garmisch and f\u00fcssen ( neuschwanstein ) . 
  things you should do in munich is visit some museums , if you like art the glyptothek ( ancient greek and roman sculptures ) and pinakotheken ( old new modern paintings ) at k\u00f6nigsplatz are definitly worth a look , the deutsches museum is a great science museum . 
  visit a beergarden , i suggest the augustinergarten at hackerbr\u00fccke instead of the overrun with tourists hofbr\u00e4uhaus . 
  and of course take a stroll through the inner city , visit the residenz , marienplatz , hofgarten englischer garten , dallmayer behind the rathaus . 
  instead visit herrenchiemsee at the chiemsee , go to berchtesgaden national park for nature . 
  tegernsee is also a nice place , with bavarian history , beautiful landscapes and mainly local tourists . 
  if you still have time consider also visiting salzburg . 
   do n't just base their campaign on screw everyone of course not , they do n't advertise screwing everyone except the rich who donate to them  but say they take some island off its shores because in a hypothetical situation they have a military base stationed there . 
  i would n't be surprised . 
  and it would be just be as wrong, 
   should 've been solved democratically . 
  i agree  debatable , people still voted him into office . 
  which does n't happen when your entire campaign is based on let 's screw everyone over . 
  republicans win elections all the time , that 's nothing to say really , with enough money for propaganda and the media on your side anyone can win  because people voted pro-russian and now there was a pro-european man in charge . 
  they thought their military bases were at danger so they recaptured them . 
  that 's a great excuse , would the us invade turkey if they voted for a pro iranian government ? 
  setting aside pro or anti russian , was n't yanukovich basically turning the ukraine into a dictatorship , jailing opposition , building a huge palace with the peoples money , corruption everywhere ? 
  he did n't care for the poeple , all he cared for was the russian money . 
  i still do n't see how russia is involved aside from being opportunistic and seizing the split in the ukrainian people to enrich themselves ? 
  austria , propably the salzburg area , since i already speak austrian , and like the food . 
  that was n't originally planned , but that 's how they got around the first discrimination complaint i think . 
  and to be honest , i think the kfz-steuer was an unfair system anyways , the person who drove 100000km each year paid the same amount as the person driving 3000km ( if they own the same kind of car ) . 
  because it is calculated by the engine displacement and environmental classification of the car , not by how much you use the roads . 
  exactly . 
  the logic behind it is : germans pay kfz-steuer , tax you have to pay if you own a car , which cover the costs for road maintenance , foreigners use the roads for free . 
  if they made everyone pay , and lowered the tax , the result would be the same , and there would be no `` discrimination '' . 
  what difference does it make for someone from france or poland if a german pays or not , they still pay regardless ? 
  well , germany is currently making a surplus , and had spent 2 trillion on the reunification , which is a one time event . 
  [ i believe this is what most people outside europe think germans look like ] ( http://bronxjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/german1.jpg ), 
  currently , x-com long war , non-virtual magic the gathering .
