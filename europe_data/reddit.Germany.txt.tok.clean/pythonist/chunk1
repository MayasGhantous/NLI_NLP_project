piecekeepers i see what you did there . 
  for whoever does n't know : it 's [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corneliu_zelea_codreanu ) . 
  no shit . 
  now let 's also put hitler amonst scientists and artists on all `` meet germany '' posts , musollini on `` meet italy '' ones and so on . 
   `` babele '' , a monument located in bucegi mountains [ `` babele '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/babele ) is not a monument . 
  it 's a rock formation . 
   the only word on that sign that 's at all comprehensible is `` endoskopia '' what about poliklinikka ? 
  in romanian , vin ( pronounced like vin in vin diesel ) means wine . 
  this map is already obsolete ( or just very confusing ) . 
  in romania the socialists are in power since the last elections . 
  because new markets and cheap labour . 
   polish ` kol\u0119dy ' which is carol singing in romanian ` colind ' , which means carol . 
  why ? 
  anyone bombing sweden ? 
  this . 
  exactly how australia did : stop them on the sea , give them water , food and medicine and send them back . 
  if some manage to get far , they 're caught and sent to some remote australian island some hundreds or thousands of miles away . 
  why was this accepted by the international community and why it would n't be accepted when it comes to europe is beyond me . 
  why the double standards ? 
  i do n't do drugs , soooo ... 
  that door is made to withstand a grenade explosion right near it ... 
   4 * 20 +19 4 * 20 +10 +9 actually why not adopting the belgian system is beyond me : nonanteneuf ... 
  that wet wall does n't look very healthy , tho ... 
  i call bull . 
  france never conquered any parts of romania , or any previous provinces that later were to become part of romania . 
  who are the distinguished gentlemen at the left of the pic ? 
  the other 3 i ( unfortunately ) recognize ... 
  looking at his username and then at his most recent 10 comments , he 's definitely one unfortunately . 
  and what exactly makes you say that ? 
  it is , i saw it live on tv . 
  i was 14 and this is not something i would forget easily . 
  i think i could identify every frame of that `` trial '' together with the execution . 
  there 's also the fact that i lived for 14 years under their rule and i definitely know their faces . 
  those in the still are definitely not actors . 
  so uk is not independent now ? 
  well , everybody knows that the front national in france , geert wilders 's lunatics , nigel farage himself , all fp\u00d6 members , most of svp in switzerland - they 're all german nazis !, 
  nigel farage 's wife ( kirsten mehr ) is even a german nazi for fuck 's sake !, 
  after all , germans , austrians , dutch , swiss - all the same !, 
  it 's true , i know it , you know it , everybody knows it !, 
  because of lack of education , that 's why . 
   a romanian applying for a job as a java programmer very probably is n't associated with one of these criminal gangs who are infamous for taking kids out of formal education as soon as they can . 
  no , but a romanian developer coming to germany and having to register with the city hall * will * get strange looks and even words when the public servant at the counter gets a first glance of their passport . 
  the same when the policeman sees his/her id . 
  as will the zoll guy at the airport . 
  and i could go on . 
  and god forbid that s/he also is dark ( er ) skinned ( as a lot of east-europeans are , without them being of roma origins ) ... 
  but yet again , while the above did happen to me , they are still the exception rather than the rule . 
  i call bullshit : germany as emotional as italy ? 
  the swiss * more * emotional than the italians ? 
   why not get rid directly of one of its biggest figures ? 
  why not get rid of ** all ** corrupt , careless , despising and despicable low life political figures ? 
  including the one you 're talking about . 
   unfortunately though , we will not live to see the day when a people will be called to vote for refreshing a political system / representatives in its entirety . 
  and i 'm almost sure that even given that opportunity , the people we 're talking about will still serenely deny themselves that chance . 
  just an addition to make things clearer :  either the stake was unimportant , or people that sustained basescu and or hated usl boycotted the referendum what about those that hate the whole political class in its entirety ? 
  those that are so sick of how politics are done in romania and of how the political figures turn out to be like that they do n't even give a shit about ** any ** elections whatsoever ... 
  my mother is born there . 
  i 'd like to visit that city some time . 
  edit : btw , do they still speak romanian there ? 
   when we do n't win ( and no nordic country does ) you won this year . 
  finland did , too , some years ago . 
  and abba . 
  read the other news sources , too , before drawing conclusions . 
  he was really about to do it , but he was apparently grabbed by a police officer at the last moment - this is why he shot himself in the throat instead of the head . 
  nobody would try to commit suicide by shooting himself in the throat : why a longer and more horrible death instead of just simply switching the computer off ? 
   what we see ** on tv ** or the ** very little that is taught to us in school ** . 
  well , this is where the true problem is and not in the huge price of traveling to europe . 
  also , i 'm sure there are ignorant people in australia , too ( far away from europe , thus very expensive to travel ) , but i never heard of an australian asking such stupid questions . 
  i really do n't know [ why the fuck you 're downvoted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v1rgu/roma_relocation_scores_romania_mayor_a_major_vote/c50phrh ) ... 
  first of all you do n't know what a `` xenophobe '' is . 
  netherlands has ( had ? ), 
  an extreme-right wing party in the parliament and in the government , so you should know better , i guess . 
  second of all , see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v1rgu/roma_relocation_scores_romania_mayor_a_major_vote/c50phrh ) . 
  the situation is described really well , and this happens every single fucking time the authorities try to civilize them a bit . 
  edit : see also [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v1rgu/roma_relocation_scores_romania_mayor_a_major_vote/c50p2td ) , also the questions from the us redditor . 
  so this is why rroma/gypsies * do not * care about bathrooms and kitchens , unless they can burn the wood in them and sell the metals . 
  that 's because they * created * this bad image themselves , by primarily not sending their children to school , generation after generation , this in turn triggering high crime rates , illiteracy , poor hygiene etc. 
  now they are doing the same abroad - there is no country in the civilized europe that does n't know about the romanian gypsies and their begging , stealing , raping etc. 
  and guess what ? 
  the same happens here : the westerner will look at me and my passport and will assimilate me with a romanian ( potential ) criminal . 
  why ? 
  because all he knows is that `` romanians are criminals '' . 
  he does n't differentiate between hard-working romanian people ( gypsy or not ) and the gypsy criminals coming from romania ( and probably he 's not even supposed to ) . 
  so , i guess the same happens everywhere . 
  sort of a `` self-triggered discrimination '' . 
  come on , we both know this will not happen ... 
  the romanian people need * much more * than this to do it . 
  where `` much more '' means either 50 + years of strong dictatorship or external influence/manipulation , your choice . 
  i do n't think so , not after the latest elections ... 
  no need to be passive aggressive !, 
  in fact , i would say that this is exactly what greeks do right now . 
  also , most of what i said above can be applied not only to greece ... from `` greece '' as country within the eu ( and as political entity ) and from `` greece '' as general mentality and fiscal education concept to `` you '' as a person and reddit user - well , it 's a very , very long way . 
  if you would stop thinking like this and at least trying to have the overall image of you being guilty of either electing the wrong representatives or you being guilty of not obeying to the rules your own state imposed , then you will get my meaning and you will see where you ( this time as a country ) are wrong . 
  until then , good luck with screwing up !, 
  you simply * can not * deny the evidence of the fact that your elected representatives shamelessly lied to the eu regarding the country 's financial status . 
  and ** this ** is one of the reasons why germany can borrow with small rates and greece does n't . 
  because germany keeps its ( financial ) promises and greece does n't . 
  greece is simply not trustworthy and can not guarantee with too much : i , for one , would n't accept tourism and olives as a guarantee . 
  i would instead accept a solid credit history . 
  nb : please try to read `` greece '' and `` germany '' not as `` you '' and `` me '' .
