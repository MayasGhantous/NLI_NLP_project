   since the afd is sitting at ~ 10 % , i am sure i can say with certainty that there is more potential for eurosceptic votes . 
  you are comparing actual votes for a party with the opinion on their central issue . 
  by that logic , everyone who answers the question `` are you satisfied with the current refugee policy '' , or `` do you want more or less refugees '' with no is a potential afd voter . 
  if that was the case they could rule the country alone with an absolute majority . 
   well , i think that this is a bit too easy as well . 
  lucke did not ignore these topics , but he was opposed to making such a shitshow out of these topics . 
  these topics took a back seat at best , and he made pretty clear that the party was about economics/euroskepticism first under him . 
  that 's pretty much one of the main reason he was ousted in the first place . 
   the share of people wanting to exit the euro actually exceeds the vote count for the afd . 
  do you have any recent statistics to back that up ? 
   they had the chance to choose between a moderate lucke and far more extremist petry and h\u00f6cke . 
  now they are more succesfull than ever sadly that is a bit too easy . 
  the problem of l\u00fccke and his wing was that they were all about economics while the big issues that drive people all over europe to vote for right wing parties are almost entirely social in natire . 
  i think it 's true that elements of the afd are steering too much to the extreme right at the moment , but l\u00fccke would not have been a valid alternative . 
  even with the refugee crisis there would have never been popular support for things like leaving the euro . 
  actually i did answer it , 
   cause everybody knows that those 12 years old will always be danger to the society and they are really needed to be put away cause its obvious that they will never learn . 
  it does n't matter if they learn or not , their actions warrant locking them up and throwing away the key from a moral point of view . 
  so edgy, 
  but you do read your own comments , yes ? 
  why the hell are you suddenly talking about germany ? 
  cheap workers were needed in the 60s , so they got invited . 
  cheap workers are not needed now , so they are not invited , and those that enter illegally will ( hopefully ) be deported . 
  why should citizens of a country support immigration that is n't beneficial to their country ? 
  it has nothing to do with trust , it has something to do with basic logic . 
  two beavers are better than one \u266a, 
  we should ** take ** sonneberg and ** push ** it somewhere else !, 
   the dolphin would beat up the woman if she did n't jack it off . 
  / r/nocontext ? 
  by that logic , why lock them up at all and not just have them under supervision ? 
  why keep someone from being a productive member of society just because he raped or killed someone ? 
  well , because that would n't be justice at all . 
   derived from humanitarian principles which basically define our culture highly debatable . 
  i value europe being the wealthiest region of the world much higher than any humanitarian effort . 
  if the latter gets in the way of the former , the latter needs to be reigned in . 
   and the other problem is that they come to europe at all , but this is a problem europe can not solve alone . 
  we could , if we had the balls to . 
   it costs money , though , and because unlike with yugoslavian refugees the population has decided to be xenophobic not wanting to throw the money of european tax payers towards non europeans is not xenophobia , it 's common sense . 
  it 's also one of the basic principles of a nation state . 
  finding an answer is n't what 's hard . 
  going through with that answer is . 
   that would mean war with turkey turkey going to war with europe would be utter suicide , especially when there 's a decent chance russia might join a war against them considering how their relations have developed recently . 
  it 's much more likely that turkey will be much tougher on refugees as well , not taking any more of them in , setting up camps for the ones already in the country and propably deporting a good chunk of them . 
   do they now want to throw overboard all pretense of the right to asylum ? 
  do they want to sacrifice the eu ? 
  collectively doing the former would avert the latter . 
  suspend asylum completely until the crisis is over . 
  close eu landborders and defend them with tear gas and rubber bullets if necessary . 
  pick up those that come by boat , confine them , ship them back to the nearest mena coast and drop them off there , no questions asked . 
  friend of mine is studying in berlin , it 's an absolute shithole . 
  would take saxony over it any day . 
  you go around and tell other people they should hang their heads of state because you feel so enlightened by your own intelligence . 
  why would they need to be elected ? 
  and a democratically elected leader gets in power because he wins a popularity contest , not because he is necessarily the best person to lead a nation . 
  it 's two different ideologies that both take a gamble to find someone who will hopefully be a good leader . 
  as long as the country is fine with it i do n't think one is objectively worse than the other . 
  dont cut yourself on that edge, 
   her motivation , who knows ? 
  for the atom thing , populism . 
  it was quite the brilliant move politically . 
  no clue on the refugees tho . 
  but what would the downside of putting them all together be ? 
   we still mock each other , they see us as lazy we see them as cold . 
  for a while we were neighbours that would leave steaming piles of shit on each other 's front porch or we 'd move the fence . 
  sounds like family, 
  if the situation in greece gets bad enough , they will eventually be forced to deal with it one way or another if they do n't want to disintegrate as a country . 
  this might lead them to employ measures that would be unacceptable in any other situation , but might arguably be needed to end this crisis . 
  like turning every boat around without asking questions , or not running rescue missions outside of their territorial waters . 
  as if the current situation was anything vaguely resembling lawful . 
  if the law is broken anyway we might as well break it in a way that gets us out of this mess . 
   this is a legal and political question , not one of physical border control . 
  it was you who was talking about physically controlling the border . 
   they have stated the will to apply for asylum here , and we thus at least must let them in to determine the dublin responsibility according to dublin their country of arrival needs to process them . 
  given that it 's impossible to enter germany without crossing other eu countries , i fail to see how a single refugee should be on german soil if dublin was actually followed . 
  it would already be enough to simply prevent people from just walking into germany . 
  close and control the border , let vehicles through . 
  would propably curb 95 % + of all illegal trespasses and do minimal , if any , economic damage . 
   first of all , we did never do that . 
  suspending dublin could very well be seen as doing just that . 
  if every single refugee was deported back to greece this crisis would have already ended . 
  not in a pleasent way , but it would nonetheless be over . 
   lg distinction is problematic when someone is neither a woman or a man oh please ... 
  discourage it both socially and financially . 
   candidate member of the eu as long as i remember why do you think they 've been a candidate for so long ? 
  because no one wants them in the eu proper . 
  their large population + population growth would give them a huge sway in the eu , and pretty much no member state wants a deeply muslim country to have that kind of influence . 
  besides that , erdogan has been running around pissing off the eu at every turn the last 5 years or so . 
  turkey as an eu member in the near future has arguably already been dead before the entire refugee shebang , but now there 's no way it will happen . 
  also , i do n't see how them being a nato country matters , no contract obligates us to financially support them when they get overrun by refugees . 
   also how do we close the border ? 
  are we going to shoot unarmed men , women and children ? 
  there are plenty of non lethal ways to stop unarmed people . 
  tear gas , water cannons , tasers , rubber bullets , flash grenades etc. 
  all offer suficient stopping power and ensure that the worst they will suffer are some bruises and light burns at worst . 
  but how is that our or even turkeys business ? 
  turkey is not an eu country , it 's non of our business how they handle it . 
  our only responsibility is to close our borders properly so they ca n't dump their problems on us . 
   i 've always seen it as `` unreasonnable people driven by hate '' , opposed at the extreme left , `` unreasonnable people driven by romantic ideas '' make no mistake , like most extremists/fundamentalists both are mostly defined by their respective out-groups . 
  the ideology behind it is just a vehicle . 
  the only real difference is who they hate .
