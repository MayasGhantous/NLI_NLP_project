apparently you know more about germany from your friend than i know from living here all my life . 
  i have never heard the word `` brit '' in a german context . 
  are there any other germans who can corroborate that story ? 
  that 's one of my criticisms of pc and pc language . 
  also why i passionately hate `` gendered '' language . 
  i 'm german and have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  please explain ? 
  we call you * briten * . 
  that means `` british '' , `` britons '' , `` brits '' , whatever you want . 
  so , denunciation is called art now ? 
  not germany , that 's for sure . 
  is n't associating certain ethnical groups with certain haplogroups total pseudo-science ? 
  it 's a three syllable word , which makes it shorter than some other names on the map . 
  they are very closely related . 
  `` germany is n't taking up enough international responsibilites ! '', 
  `` the bundeswehr is falling apart , what a joke ! '', 
  * germany invests in military * `` the germans are on the rise again !, 
  quick , smack them down ! '', 
  `` omg we will all die !!, 
  hooligans will be hooligans . 
   the chocolate pudding challenge caused an uproar in israel . 
  finance minister yair lapid branded the owner of the facebook page an `` anti-zionist '' , the equivalent of a traitor , because it calls on israelis to leave their home for berlin . 
  this is what i do n't like about israel . 
  that overboarding nationalism . 
  or he happened to be chancellor when the gdr fell apart . 
  i 'd say it 's [ konrad adenauer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/konrad_adenauer ) . 
  i do n't think that right-wing extremists working in security firms is an isolated occurence . 
  it was actually my first thought when i heard about the case . 
  pairing neo-nazis with asylum seekers is just an awesome idea . 
  this study neglects all principles of historical linguistic research . 
  see this review : http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/review_pagel2013.pdf, 
  i came here to say hipsters too . 
  `` homesickness '' , to be precise . 
   it 's such an old word that it probably already existed in the common ancestor of dutch , german and english ( proto-germanic ) just because a word exists in a variety of languages , it does n't necessarily have to be cognate ( descended from a common ancestor through regular sound change ) . 
  it 's probably just a loan translation . 
   fun fact : some of the oldest words probably are `` ouch '' , `` spit '' and `` worm '' , since they are phonetically similar in the large majority of european and asian languages . 
  this is so unscientific and wrong that it hurts . 
  do n't watch german tv . 
  it 's bad . 
  ( i think that 's a more accurate statement . ), 
   i guess it 's the language . 
  german is made for engineers and bureaucrats , not for being funny or even the bed . 
  seriously ? 
  can you provide a picture of your cylindrically shaped lips ? 
  i 'd really like too see such a thing . 
  to be fair , the guy in the picture * is * drinking a hot coffee . 
   but the smartest people i 've ever met were all americans meeting smart americans in america . 
  what a coincidence . 
   like some boring east german industrial town [ tom hanks listens to you . 
  ] ( http://www.iefimerida.gr/sites/default/files/tom5_0.jpg ), 
  now that i think about it ... 
  it 's really just kids and hip-hop fans . 
  and my dad . 
   wow , your sarcasm detectors seem to be completely broken . 
  there are enough people on reddit who are sincere about the most batshit crazy things . 
  you should consider using the '' / s '' tag . 
  the craziest ones are always the loudest ones . 
  watch tv . 
  browse reddit . 
  watch tv . 
  i 'm glad germans do n't generelly use them . 
  i kinda like the scrrrrk-tshk sound a snow shovel makes . 
  if germany does n't top that chart again in 2016 , something has gone horribly wrong . 
  i see a lot of young turkish girls with headscarfs ... 
  i like my water with a little hint of beer taste . 
  i see . 
  i imagine everything is about the gauls . 
  they are . 
  but i was talking about a [ different family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnic_languages ) . 
  * western * europe . 
  besides , hungarian came much later than the ie languages . 
  finnish maybe too . 
  it 's the best hypothesis of basque relationships that we have , although it 's still controversial . 
  edit : i was n't downvoting you , but strengthening your point . 
  afaik some indo-european may have been spoken around the gulf of finland before the baltic-finnic languages arrived , but i 'm no expert on the topic either . 
  baltic-finnic however pushed saamic further north . 
  edit : yeah . 
  if anyone would care to explain the downvoting , it 'd be nice . 
  i do n't know where the majority of archaeologists stands on this , but afaik most proponents of the anatolian hypothesis are archaeologists ( * cough * or biologists * cough * ) . 
  david anthony is an archaeologist who strongly advocates the pontic hypothesis . 
   most linguists favor an anatolian origin for the indo-european languages , while anthropologists and geneticists think it 's the black sea coast in modern ukraine . 
  it 's the other way round . 
  which `` indo-aryan root '' are you talking about ? 
  the indo-aryan languages are the modern indian languages descended from sanskrit . 
  balto-slavic and indo-iranian ( among others ) share some important sound changes , but the internal relationships of the indo-european subfamilies are quite controversial , so to say with any confidence that balto-slavic is the closest to indo-aryan is a bit of a stretch . 
  and in large areas of today 's eastern spain ... 
  well , all the baltic-finnic languages for that matter . 
  maybe he wanted to destroy the evidence ... 
  you should tell your yellow press . 
  it 's quite telling how far you need to scroll down to find something about germany . 
  it was a very rural area even when it still belonged to germany . 
   under the sea thanks , now i 've got that song stuck in my head again . 
  the difference is that in the purple areas there is usually a city of the same size right next to the other . 
  my city has < 200,000 inhabitants , but it 's part of the ruhrgebiet , so ... 
  very interesting read !, 
  um yes , that 's what i meant . 
  i should have said `` shocked '' . 
   and you folks need to do a better job at teaching your immigrants what it means to be german however , this is really really difficult because of exactly that ` cultural zeitgeist ' you described . 
  a large percentage of the muslim community in europe is on the lower end of the demographic spectrum ( i.e. 
  the poor and uneducated ) .
