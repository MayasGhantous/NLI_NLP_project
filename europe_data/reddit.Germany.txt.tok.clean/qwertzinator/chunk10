  i do n't know what the government is thinking , but somehow i find this statement offensive . 
  no , we need an heir of charlemagne . 
  the problem is , there are too many pretenders to the throne . 
  i 'm in favour of such a union , but the peoples of europe must overcome their nationalism for it to work . 
  i do n't see that happening anytime soon . 
  concerning the name , `` european union '' sounds perfectly fine to me . 
  that kind of mentality is so 19th century . 
  turkic = / = turkish, 
  an older working title for `` a dream of spring '' was `` a time for wolves '' , following `` the winds of winter '' . 
  so it 'll all take place in december - january . 
  tbf , ankara is not in europe however you look at it . 
  i do n't think he 'd want that job at his age . 
  is n't `` deus vult '' from the crusades ? 
  `` gott mit uns '' is a slogan from the thirty years war . 
  that was a lord of the rings reference . 
  how can that be your decision ? 
  you are part of this continent , are n't you ? 
  you must help , please !, 
  you must do something !,

  it 's a ufo . 
  this is [ hamburg ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/plenarsaal_hamburgische_b%c3%bcrgerschaft_img_6403_6404_6405_edit.jpg/1024px-plenarsaal_hamburgische_b%c3%bcrgerschaft_img_6403_6404_6405_edit.jpg ) . 
  well , [ here ] ( http://www.gruene-fraktion-bayern.de/sites/default/files/imagecache/lightbox/plenarsaal_03_.jpg ) is bavaria ... 
  it 's that bullshit over-the-top political correctness culture . 
  * very much ahistorical , but the iliad would make for a great tv show . 
  * something set during the waning years of the western roman empire , which is an extremely interesting period to me . 
  it could be centered on alaric , for example . 
  * taking place around the same time , but probably ahistorical , is the story around the saxon invasion of britain , starring vortigern and hengist . 
  it would be full of political intrigue , love and seduction , and lots and lots of battles . 
  it was out of print , basically . 
  you could own it , you could sell it , no problem . 
  but the copyright holder ( bavaria ) chose to not reproduce it . 
  it was never banned , just ... withheld . 
  good analysis . 
  we need a `` zentralrat der karikaturisten '' to lobby for that . 
  what a coincidence . 
  at least the bible has sex and bloodshed . 
  german loanwords popping up in weird places . 
  on the other hand , people cry `` racist '' when you mention negative aspects of non-white cultures . 
  so , either none or all . 
  i wonder when the rest of the world can shrug off the hitler reputation . 
  everytime germany acts more assertive , someone is crying `` nazis '' . 
  there are still people who associate germany with military and war , even though modern german society is extremely pacifistic . 
  post-1945 , of course . 
  why do you need an app for everything ? 
  you can just call . 
  the comments in this thread are utterly disgusting . 
  i can see the pitchforks marching to the nearest asylum center . 
   she is directly responsible for the death of french nationals on european soil . 
  in that case , she was one of the bombers and is already dead . 
  problem solved . 
  huh . 
  i did n't know kaufland and lidl are so big beyond germany . 
   also personally i find everything built between ww2 and the 21st century to be so hideous that i want to cry when i think about what was lost . 
  look up `` brutalismus '' on wikipedia . 
  * and then go cry in a corner ... *, 
   i also heard from a friend who worked in hamburg that north german bread is shit -  rye bread is not bread you fucking ingrates i think these two statements are directly related . 
  this is creepy . 
  you think it 'll make you a nazi ? 
  godwin 's law strikes again . 
  a slippery wet floor is a dangerous thing . 
  i do n't get that . 
  why would someone agree with someone else whose ethical and political views are contrarian to their own ? 
  you 're not making any sense at all . 
  they have russing accents because they 've been speaking russian all their life . 
  you ca n't get an accent from your genes . 
  `` isegrimm '' is also the name of the wolf in german fables . 
   people need to realise that irish is actually a very logical language careful . 
  stuff like that can get you featured on / r/badlinguistics instantly . 
  it 's a description of german intellectual writing style . 
  the usa are a country made by immigrants from all over the world . 
  germany , until quite recently , has been very homogeneous ethnically , and as a result is struggling to accomodate to the new situation . 
  like all european countries . 
  france , uk or the netherlands may be farther in that regard than germany , but just look at eastern europe and see how they react towards immigrants . 
  how well does multi-kulti work in turkey ? 
  just wondering . 
  he does have a point though . 
  dropping out after elementary school is not legally possible . 
  but 70 % only achieving the lowest degree , which is the worst possible * legal * outcome , is bad . 
  really bad . 
  english has compound words , there are just not written as one word in most cases . 
  * i 'm looking for a maid of three-and-ten . 
  the brits used to put `` made in germany '' labels on stuff so that people would n't buy bad quality german products . 
  so we started making really good quality products . 
  then the brits said that germans are n't funny . 
  so we ... you get the idea . 
  no , the trial has just started . 
  that 's a sociolect spoken by young people with mostly turkish background on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum . 
  how quaint . 
  yes , it does . 
  you see , we are using different definitions of the term `` heavy metal '' . 
  as far as i 'm aware , there are three different definitions that you can see used by people , ordered from more broader to narrow : 1 ) `` heavy metal '' as a synonym of `` hard rock '' . 
  that 's the original use of the term and you can sometimes see it used by older people , e.g. 
  when someone describes aerosmith or blue cheer as `` heavy metal bands '' . 
  2 ) `` heavy metal '' as a genre derived , but distinct , from hard rock , i.e. 
  `` metal '' . 
  that 's the most commonly used definition of the term ( especially in the media ) and what most people understand when they hear it . 
  3 ) `` heavy metal '' as a catch-all term for the styles that existed before the metal genre splintered into more distinctive subgenres during the mid 80 's , but used in opposition of these . 
  i used to use the term as in ( 3 ) , like you , but i 've found it to be impractical . 
  first of all , it gives the impression of a coherent subgenre , which it is n't - it 's more like the * absence * of a proper subgenre , so to speak .
