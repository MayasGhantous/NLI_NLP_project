  and it 's really fuzzy ... 
  sometimes it includes glam metal and sometimes not ; sometimes it includes speed metal and sometimes not ... you get the idea . 
  and most people outside the metal fandom ( and sometimes within ) would n't comprehend the term in that way and you 'd have to resort to call it `` traditional heavy metal '' or something similar to differentiate it from the meaning in ( 2 ) . 
   the german electorate has very little influence on who is actually voted for because the last time we had influence , we elected hitler , and that was so rad that we 'd jump at the opportunity to do it all over again so we can not be trusted . 
  the voting public did n't have any more influence on that in the weimar republic . 
  they did n't vote hitler into the nsdap , but they voted for the nsdap with hitler at its top . 
  that 's not different from today . 
  and hitler was n't elected reichskanzler by the electorate , but appointed by hindenburg . 
   what i am saying is that whether or not he is successful on the national level is ultimately up to the voter and i find the assumption that he is just going to become an influential person on a national level now because those idiots are gon na vote for me anyway highly preposterous in nature . 
  well , let 's be realistic . 
  he * is * a high-ranking member of the spd and probably among their most popular ones . 
  it 's not unlikely that he would be given a ministerial job in the next government right away and then run for chancellor at the next chance . 
  he does n't need to be elected to get into a position of influence ( or at least not outside an spd convention ) . 
  that was when we began voting for who how many seats in the parliament a party gets and which of your direct candidates will be sent there . 
  maybe i 've lived my adult life behind the moon , but i ca n't remember when we started to vote on who gets to be a member of a certain party or is allowed to engage in a certain field of politics or who is put in which slot on the party list or gets selected for a government job by the chancellor or ... 
   martin schulz , who now thinks about leaving the ep and transferring his political career to the national level of germany - last time i checked , that 's not his fucking decision but the voters ' . 
  since when do we vote on who gets to be in politics in germany ? 
  we are voting for parties , and if the spd decides to give him a job , then that 's their right . 
  i know . 
  and death metal is a subgenre of heavy metal . 
  then what are they ? 
  jazz ? 
  according to wikipedia , the saarland has 387 inhabitants/km \u00b2 . 
  so it 's fine that turkey has to take a few million refugees and europe only a few hundred thousand ? 
  that 's kind of funny . 
  you 're beyond any help . 
  she does n't alienate people more than any other head of government . 
  the refugee situation was a divisive topic anyway . 
  that 's why the german unification started with a [ customs union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zollverein ) . 
   they are to hungarians and to a few tribes in russia as well . 
  this annoys me so much . 
  people hear that finnish and hungarian are related and think that they 're similar . 
  they 're not . 
  it 's like saying that english and persian are similar just because they 're part of the same language phylum . 
  that 's an interesting train of thought . 
  as long as turkey controls the bosporus , nato will not let them leave . 
  `` luft '' means `` air '' , precisely . 
  that 's the problem with the english-speaking world using the generic german nouns as if they were some nazi-specific terms . 
  the insignia check out : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:roundel_of_the_german_air_force_ ( with_border ) . svg ( it is indeed derived from the teutonic order coat of arms ), 
   i know many people here are too young for that whoa . 
  considering that there are no occitan monolinguals alive , you probably wo n't hear any occitan without at least a pinch of french prosody . 
  here , have a pat on the back . 
  you 're not a fan of differentiation , are you . 
  if scripts can be sexy , then tibetan totally is . 
  like e.g. 
  yeah , tried that . 
  once . 
  they did n't have them where i stayed . 
  it 's probably one of those things that you did n't know you ever needed before you had it . 
  i 've never seen one my whole life . 
  what 's so amazing about it ? 
  whoa , is it 2002 again ? 
   lidl is a grocery store chain , common in europe , but might not even operate in america . 
  afaik they 're about to expand to the us right now . 
  turkish city , to be more precise . 
  oh , thanks , 
   and ( usually ) nobody is yelling ever watched `` hart aber fair '' ? 
  now i want to go to burger 's zoo . 
  great place . 
   he has the nerve to ~ ~ criticise ~ ~ ** insult ** other sovereign nations for not allowing him to hold political rallies on their soil ftfy, 
   turkey deserves erdowahn just as the us deserves the dear orange leader . 
  a majority of voters voted * against * trump , after all . 
  it 's just shortened from * pommes frites * . 
  or you can add curry sauce and sausage , which makes it even betterer . 
   germanic german  otto i that would be [ this fellow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_i,_holy_roman_emperor ) . 
  otto von bismarck was just the chancellor , the king was [ wilhelm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_i,_german_emperor ) . 
  a german would n't eat fries with ketchup , you silly . 
  the number of cases alone does n't make the grammar complicated . 
  in german , while the actual number of different forms is rather low , the inflection of a noun phrase changes not only depending on the case , but also on number , gender , inflection class and definiteness . 
  in hungarian , on the other hand , there are more different forms , but they work more like prepositions , just stuck to the end of the word . 
  he 's like the third man on the first moon mission . 
  yeah , it 's the british who came up with that . 
  you see the pattern here ? 
  not a pizza ... 
  `` austrian '' was just a subset of `` german '' . 
  you mean `` jjwalking '', 
  it 's not hard to copy a word from wikipedia or an online dictionary . 
  not a fort , but a pleasure palace . 
  i think that has become better since / r/de merged with / r/deutschland . 
  though now it 's just flooded with memes . 
  by * fire and blood * . 
  whoever has n't heard of martin schulz has either been sleeping under a rock during the last few years , avoids anything eu-related like the plague , or has no interest in politics whatsoever . 
  that 's what came to my mind as well . 
  although i would argue that the northern half of germany is much more uniform than southern germany . 
  right . 
  i think decisions like this should have at least a 2/3 majority . 
  it is not merkel who is `` destroying what has been built '' and it 's not the immigrants . 
  it 's the populist nationalists . 
  it 's them who want to turn back the time 50 years . 
  they are destroying the eu and european solidarity . 
  in the long run , they are hurting europe more than any terrorist could . 
  a person tried to save other people , and everyone applauds him for that . 
  do n't make this into a national circle jerk . 
  a bread roll , similar in taste to the french baguette . 
  a german breakfast staple , but is eaten throughout the day as a sandwich . 
  while we 're at it - this one 's more fitting : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42hvikk0qjw, 
  while i do agree with their cause , the protesters are discrediting themselves with their attacks on ewe personnel and police . 
  people could have been killed here . 
  some of those activists are extremists playing at revolution . 
   ms sturgeon said other eu governments were hearing comments from britain that suggested the uk wanted to `` have its cake and eat it '' -  in addition to that , other member states are hearing comments that suggest the uk can have its cake and eat it yes , you already said that .
