  and a large percentage of lower class people are muslims . 
  so the likelihood of jihadists to be former welfare recipients is rather big , i would think . 
  as the saying goes : `` correlation does not imply causation '' . 
  therefore i do n't see why this is news . 
  `` the ugly truth '' ? 
  i would be even more concerned if the anti-semitism stemmed from ethnic germans . 
  yes , i suppose . 
  well , for the most part it is . 
  people only dress like that on certain occasions and if they have a sense of tradition . 
  the oktoberfest is such an occasion that has gotten a bit out of hand ... 
  but what i was trying to say is , that in germany `` lederhosen '' or `` dirndl '' are exclusively associated with bavarians and austrians . 
  that 's why germans cringe so hard at the lederhosen stereotype . 
  it 's like portraying all british people with kilts . 
  what many americans think a german dresses like . 
  too bad he 's not german . 
  israeli politicians ca n't call him a nazi for this . 
  should n't we first reunite with that other german state in the south-east ? 
  it gives them the ability to prosecute people who return to germany from fighting for is . 
  one of the most beautiful places in all of germany . 
  you 're right , but can you imagine the back-door negotiations ? 
  it would be a mess . 
  that 's nice . 
  now see to pompeii . 
  i feel like this would be one of the most historical moments in my lifetime so far . 
  it 's * at least * up there with the fall of the berlin wall and 9/11 . 
  denmark has [ these ] ( http://www.alex-reiseseite.de/schweden/images/115.jpg ) . 
  not exactly enormous , but stone . 
  i 'd love to do that ; but then again i 'm not sure what they are capable of . 
  religious fanatics are bat-shit crazy . 
  i guess fear works for them . 
  the police has said that they are counting the vests as uniforms and will prosecute them for wearing them . 
  this , or `` union of european nations '' . 
  you might consider reading the article instead of just the headline of this thread . 
  `` jeep '' for any kind of off-road car . 
  `` pampers '' for diapers . 
  it 's nice to see that the hate for germany in greece is still going strong . 
  ah come on . 
  you ca n't have * both * reliable cars * and * not being exterminated . 
  do n't be silly , we 're not perfect either . 
  those poor souls are paid for by the communes , which for the most part are all but bankrupt . 
   now germany thinks it 's ok to solve its problems with romania 's resources . 
    but germany does n't think it 's ok for romania to solve its problems with germany 's resources . 
    here 's what i propose : if romanian doctors create economic value in germany and not in romania , then germany can not simply refuse responsibility for romania 's problems . 
  if they want to send the ( non-working ) gypsies back , that 's fine in principle , but then they should also help defray the cost of caring for them , especially because that cost is lower in romania . 
  i 'm getting the impression that you have no idea how a job market works . 
  what you are arguing for is an immigration ban for romanians . 
  romania and the eu need to work to improve working conditions for professionals in romania . 
  until then , it 's not germany 's fault that they leave romania . 
  stop making it sound like germany is taking your professionals away . 
  i did . 
  the rest of the article is about child allowance . 
  what are you on about ? 
   obviously the intention is to send the gypsies back . 
  the intention is to send back people who leech the social system with no intention for paying into it . 
  your wording makes it sound racist . 
   if you can have it both ways then the way you are treating our partnership is dishonest . 
  is there any treaty with romania that says `` we take x percent of your population '' or what ? 
  what does it have to do with `` treating our partnership '' ? 
  this is bullshit . 
   one of the new provisions envisaged by the german government is a controversial re-entry ban of up to five years for eu citizens who ** tricked the system or lied in their applications for welfare benefits ** . 
  if the gypsies come to germany to work , they are more than welcome . 
  all of continental europe has very well adapted to the metric system . 
  you know , germans would do just that . 
  but there is no politician with balls in germany . 
  that shows how ingrained alcohol is in european culture . 
  too many to choose from german history ... 
  it 's portrayed better than it is in global media . 
  it 's portrayed worse than it is by germans . 
  what a shame . 
  those are actually pretty buildings . 
  we read [ damals war es friedrich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_%28novel%29 ) in 4th grade . 
   in a 12 or 13 years of school , you come across wwi and wwii at least twice . 
  put an emphasis on * at least * . 
  i came across the war at least twice in history class alone . 
  plus at least once in elementary school , german class and religion class each . 
  germans do n't want to talk about the war not because they 're ashamed ( i do n't have anything to be ashamed of ) , but because 1 ) it sounds like wwii is the only thing people associate germany with , and 2 ) we simply ca n't hear it anymore . 
   the glitter of myspace pages oh , the sudden memories ... 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
  i came to the site via a link on reddit . 
  on closer examination , it does appear to have some `` interesting '' political views ... 
  this is what i read :  there are many more worms in that can . 
  one of them is the germany still has no peace treaty . 
  because nobody wants to open that can of worms , both german , u.s. , british , polish and other diplomats and mps are doing all they can to convince themselves , the media and the public that the so-called 2 +4 contract `` substitutes '' a peace treaty . 
  military historian peter feist commented that `` if '' the 2 +4 contract had the function of a peace treaty , `` then '' the words peace treaty would be written on its front page , or at least somewhere in the document . 
  the fact is , germany and poland have no peace treaty and as long as they have n't signed one , wwii legally still continues . 
  http://nsnbc.me/2014/07/11/germany-expels-u-s-spy-chief-opens-geopolitical-can-of-worms/ edit : ok , this site is apparently full of shit . 
  still , i 'm going to look into german sovereignty . 
  well , and i learned today that germany is legally still at war ... : /, 
  right , and most dishes that are common thoughout the country are also common in neighbouring countries . 
  the danish and dutch national dishes here are just as german . 
  what 's racist about cabbage salad ? 
  what is the megali idea ? 
  i think much less people in europe would complain if only the red areas would apply for eu membership ... 
  germany here . 
  in terms of power : 10th - 13th century ( hre ) in terms of culture and intellectuality : ca . 
  1700-1900 ( `` land der dichter und denker '' ) in terms of individual wealth and freedom : since the 1950s, 
  i obviously * saw * a black person in the picture . 
  but it did n't cross my mind `` hey that 's a black person there '' . 
  i did n't give the skin colour any attention .
