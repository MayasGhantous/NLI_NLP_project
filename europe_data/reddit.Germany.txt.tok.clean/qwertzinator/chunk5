  i loved it when the german commentator stopped talking . 
  needless to say , the irish fans sang themselves into the hearts of the world that day . 
  you guessed well . 
  but still , ftfy . 
  loanwords from french in ** bold ** , loanwords from latin in * italics * . 
   i do n't know if you 're giving an * explanation * or ** really ** ** posing ** the ** question ** , but yeah , after the ** norman ** ** invasion ** of ** britain ** , the french ( or rather franco-norman ) ** language ** was for a long time the ** language ** of ** nobility ** , and this ** influenced ** english * vocabulary * * significantly * . 
  ( words in bold in this ** comment ** are words which i 'm guessing are ** derived ** from french ), 
   is german community aware of the differences between sunni turks and alevi turks ? 
  i 'm not sure , i think the vast majority of people are not . 
   now most of our grand family still resides there and when i ask them they say they have great relationship with everyone . 
  of course you ca n't make generalisations . 
  and you should consider that seeheim is a small town and probably does n't have a big turkish community . 
  i think there is a resentment against turks and arabs among many people in germany , be it latent or open . 
  that 's the problem with nation states , where citizenship and ethnicity are thrown together . 
   our immigrants ? 
  as in , people from our country who moved abroad ? 
  we call them expats and they are super qualified , and other nations would collapse without them . 
  and when they fled during wars , dictatorships and coups d'etat , they were all legally immigrating . 
  and they integrated to the host countries in 5 seconds after setting foot there . 
  that would be * emigrants * . 
  that 's the first time i 've ever heard the term `` mittelosteuropa '' . 
  see ? 
  we 've got something in common after all . 
   this is a land that flows with beer . 
  it takes it very seriously . 
  i see what you did there . 
  right , but the op makes it sound like everything in germany is rosy and the germans are arrogant about it . 
  thank you . 
  i would have said the same , but i 'm not allowed to speak on this thread . 
  and what if she wins ? 
  will it have any consequences ? 
  will the railway company 's officials be arrested when they enter the usa ? 
  this is sad and hilarious at the same time . 
   most dutch , flemish and austrians do n't consider themselves `` germans '' . 
  and germany did not even exist before 1871 . 
  with the austrians it 's a quite recent phenomenon though . 
  they did n't want to be associated with germany after ww2 . 
   britian entered the war in response to the invasion of friendly democracies by a major power . 
  are you sure you do n't mix up ww1 and ww2 ? 
  that 's from lotr , right ? 
  oh dear , please not . 
  as a german , i mostly make fun of the french . 
  i do n't think he actually wants to join the eu anymore . 
  i love rauchbier !, 
   i 've been to an oktoberfest in new braunfels , which is near austin in the hill country , which is the historically german part of texas . 
  everyone dressed up in german clothes , drank beer , and ate sausages . 
  i always find it a bit awkward when everyone dresses up like they 're bavarian , even though their ancestors came from totally different regions . 
  and he died recently . 
  rip . 
  wow . 
  i can still get it for 3 $ . 
  i said historically . 
  frankfurt was the place where the german emperors were elected , it was the capital of the german confederation and the place where the national assembly was held in 1848/49 . 
  besides , it 's situated a bit more centrally in germany than berlin or bonn . 
  i think it 's quite unfortunate that frankfurt did n't win . 
  it has a better claim historically than bonn or even berlin . 
   [ ... ] and usually forgotten in lists of european countries . 
  because it 's not in europe ? 
  most of all that it has so little democratic legitimisation . 
  i 'm very much pro eu , but i 'm critical of the eu as it is constructed right now . 
  oh , the eu is actually not that popular in europe . 
  or at least you can get that impression from the people who cry the loudest . 
  yes , but the new government is not in place yet . 
  here you go . 
  westerwelle has already rebuffed assad . 
  basically , whenever someone in germany speaks against israeli policies , they 're called anti-semitic and comparisons to the holocaust are drawn . 
  that 's moral blackmailing . 
  in my eyes it 's not only ridiculous , but also extremely disrespectful towards the victims of the holocaust . 
  and it 's getting tedious . 
  yes , i 'm thinking specifically of this : http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/neue-eu-richtlinien-zu-juedischen-siedlungen-empoeren-israels-regierung-a-911457.html it 's in german , so here 's the relevant information : - the eu declares that all treaties between israel and eu from 2014 onwards are valid within the borders of 1967 . 
  - therefore israeli settlements in palestinian territories are excluded from support . 
  - the eu says that the settlements are illegal according to international law and does not recognise them . 
  - israeli minister says that this is racist , discriminates the jewish people and is reminiscent of the boycotts against jews 66 years ago . 
  - another minister says that judea and samaria ( i.e. 
  the west bank ) is not an occupied territory but the cradle of the jewish people . 
  - the representative of the settlers aks via twitter : `` how will be selection done on youth delegations?a german will say : tel aviv to the right , east jlem to the left ? 
  or it will be a polish job ? '', 
  - israeli opposition welcomes the european initiative . 
  so typical . 
  at least they did n't call everyone a nazi again . 
  i wonder whether it 's their own fault or the media 's . 
  or both . 
  which is alarming . 
  but i feel like the media did n't do a good job portraying the implications of the nsa affair . 
  right . 
  as i said , i do n't care for the fdp . 
  i do n't care for the fdp , but yes , there is now a lack of liberalism in the bundestag ... 
  maybe because they 're just as populist . 
  because she does n't say anything . 
  i 'll vote for the pirates . 
  they 're still the party that represents my interests the most . 
  that 's like studying a taxidermic sculpture instead of a living animal . 
  why is it important to preserve the egyptian pyramids ? 
  or rembrandt 's paintings ? 
  why is it important to preserve endangered species ? 
  `` that common touch , he thinks , is why the germans identify so much with their chancellor that in the past few years they have started to call her mutti -- `` mum '' . '', 
  i 've always had the impression that `` mutti '' is actually very sarcastic . 
  many german dialects * are endangered , if not on the verge of extinction . 
  * which could be called ` languages ' , but the distinction between ` dialect ' and ` language ' is arbitrary , more relying on social and political criteria than linguistic ones . 
  true , but unfortunately not acknowledged by the general public .
