  also , there is e * who * - g * wer * e * where * - g * wo *, 
   for example , the dutch word zee ( sea ) sounds like the german see ( lake ) while meer ( lake ) sounds like the german word ** meer ** ( sea ) . 
  to add to the confusion , meer ( more ) is still mehr in german . 
  ftfy  it 's even funnier now . 
   note : this is a joke guys . 
  and such a clever and original one . 
   welsh has seven vowels . 
  if anything it 's english that 's a bit short . 
   english has about 12 vowel phonemes ( depending on the dialect ) . 
  welsh has 13 . 
  you win , but by a different number . 
  the first one is a phrase , not a sentence . 
  the part before the `` and '' would be a complex compound noun though . 
  elementary school sucked . 
  they * are * the fun . 
  thank you . 
  some sanity to keep me sane . 
  this `` rivalry '' is really one-sided . 
  we do n't care about england . 
  netherlands though ... 
  7-1 * was * historical . 
  i condemn this action and the perpetrator ( s ) . 
  and they must be persecuted . 
  but to deny thousands of people asylum just because some * might * be criminal would be the ** real ** collateral damage here . 
  help refugees . 
  convict criminals . 
  the latter overrules the former . 
  til that all refugees are murderers and criminals . 
  let me tell you this : those people are humans . 
  and among hundred thousands of people , there are bound to be some assholes . 
  oh dear , this thread . 
  wtf . 
  seriously . 
  edit : i do n't know if i should have put a '' / s '' behind the first line or if i should leave / r/europe for good until the level-headed folks take over again . 
  those back-stabbers . 
  the same reason why people watch horror films , i suppose . 
  it looks just like the sort of place that breeds crime and desperation . 
   probably not in your mind go on . 
  keep guessing my thoughts . 
  no , you have to address the possible problems that mass immigration can cause and instate measures to prevent them . 
  attacking refugees and burning shelters is not such a measure . 
  attack is the best form of defence !, 
  the eu is trying to get those masses more evenly distributed , but many member states are blocking . 
  most ( or even all ?! ), 
  of these attacks in germany happen in areas where there has been little previous immigration . 
  those are just xenophobic idiots who have had no contact to other cultures and are now panicking . 
  i did n't know how the film was going to end , so i thought they would die on the bottom ... 
  the claustrophobic feel was overwhelming , and seeing that the film was going for another 3/4 hour i was n't sure if i could stand watching it to the end . 
  the actual ending is a bit cheesy imo . 
  there 's a difference between `` integration '' and `` assimilation '' . 
  there has to be a joke somewhere about an austrian ordering an `` anschluss '' from a german isp !, 
  in german , we have the word * matte * `` mat '' as a derogatory term for all long hairstyles . 
  stop shivering , have you read the article ? 
   maybe you imagine spain as being a desert full of sand and cacti ? 
  but more like ... shrubby . 
  i 'm quite surprised that spain has more forests than germany . 
  hey , we never said that you ca n't have the name . 
  that was all you !, 
  and you invade our sauerland . 
  i call it a cultural exchange . 
  sand is cheaper than concrete . 
  sorry for nitpicking , tolkien fanboy here . 
  it 's `` argonath '' . 
  ouch . 
  i was very young when i watched it , so my memory of it is rather murky . 
  edit : i recited the text from memory , my memory is faulty :d, 
  being german makes this feel so much less abstract , when this could have been your own grandfather ... makes you realize that you ca n't divide the world into `` human beings '' and `` monsters '' . 
  i 'll just wait until the situation resolves itself or until i know the public opinion . 
  the classic `` thirty years war '' by c.v. wedgwood, 
  i 'm currently reading a book about the thirty years war . 
  we are so lucky . 
  i did n't actually disagree with / u/etibamriovxuevut . 
  they argued that certain acts of speech are right to not be protected under `` freedom of speech '' , and i clarified that `` freedom of speech '' actually does n't entail these sorts of things by definition . 
  i do n't make the laws . 
  i did n't define the term . 
  and i 'm not even arguing . 
  i use `` freedom of speech '' as meaning `` freedom of opinion '' because that 's what it is . 
  i always say that berlin is the most un-german city of all . 
  free speech does n't mean you can say whatever you want whenever you want to whomever you want . 
  it means that the state ca n't prosecute you for expressing a certain opinion ( critisizing the authorities in particular ) . 
  but i agree that a ban on holocaust denial is problematic . 
  it 's a dangerous mindset , sure , but that should n't be an issue for the law enforcement , but for societal and scientific discourse . 
  i 'm sure she just wants to beat kohl . 
  although , being from the west , i would have expected france or the netherlands . 
  because he 's a power-hungry slick . 
  i know you 're joking , but i fully expect him to leave politics for good once merkel is gone from her post . 
  it 's still too large a number to handle in such short notice . 
  we do n't have the necessary infrastructure for that . 
   i wonder where we go from here ... is there any chance of him becoming chancellor of germany in the future ? 
  o_o fortunately not . 
  he is too old , and probably too frail for the job . 
  maybe he 'll go for president . 
  i can tell you that he 's a very controversial figure in germany . 
  it varies a bit from region to region , but generally , yes . 
  those two things are staples . 
  i 'm by no means an expert , but my impression is that quality does n't rise significantly from $ 50 up . 
  i often ca n't understand a french person speaking english or german either . 
  it 's definitely the influence of french on spoken breton . 
  the person in the audio is probably not a native speaker . 
   the one that sounds the least english is usually irish .
