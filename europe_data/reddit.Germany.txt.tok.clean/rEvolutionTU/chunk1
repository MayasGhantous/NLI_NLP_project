the plan was actually [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/62sovt/rplace_megathread/dfp0urn/ ) right here ( [ picture ] ( http://imgur.com/a/pbqvj ) ) . 
  super sad it did n't work out , that was glorious . 
  we 're fine with [ less than a thousand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds4nbclmega ) of them , too . 
  they strong . 
  they loyal . 
  man i 'm so sad that heart was eaten up . 
  and now all of the eu flag is being vandalized with even the rainbowroad making attacks again . . and murican invasions on the left of the german flag . 
  switzerland unter attack by the void . 
  at least the french look stable now . 
  [ smallest possible star ] ( http://orig12.deviantart.net/c754/f/2014/133/e/e/_tutorial__tiny_pixel_star_by_ennyri-d7i7qtn.png ) . 
  hard to coordinate though . 
  hey , i 'm using all my pixels to help you guys establish lebensraum south and north !, 
  personally i honestly think it 's a weird concept because it 's so inherently abstract . 
  i love the area i live in and enjoyed most places i visited . 
  i adore the german constitution . 
  i 'm in love with our press culture . 
  the [ german language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh1svgmy4qs ) is something i think is absolutely amazing . 
  but to me the idea of being like `` i love my fatherland '' or being openly patriotic is n't just uncomfortable but just plain dumb . 
  i also find people talking about how `` we '' won anything when it comes to sports teams they support dumb so at least i 'm consistent there . 
  hell , i ca n't even say that i particularly like other germans more than brits , french or italians for example . 
  all places have great people and shitty people . 
  i think when in doubt on a scale of being too patriotic and not patriotic enough ( is this even * really * an issue anywhere in the world ? ), 
  i 'd rather see people err on the latter side rather than the former . 
  overall i think that 's the smarter choice for humanity . 
  ________ i 'd like to be proud as a human and of fellow humans . 
  all the other shit is just temporary fluff and based on lotteries anyway if we really break it down . 
   over the last few decades the right wing have only become stronger and the underlying problems they address only worse . 
   cnn ha , see , you 're just a victim of fake news propaganda . 
  nah , bavaria was busy watching the carnival show of their [ franconian ] ( http://meedia.de/2017/02/18/mega-rekord-br-besiegt-mit-fastnacht-in-franken-das-erste-rtl-co-sat-1-floppt-mit-so-tickt-der-mensch/ ) overlords . 
   not sure how any of this is `` sinister '' , by the way . 
  we as a society have decided that advertising ( whose entire purpose is to influence people into making decisions they would not otherwise have made and often come down to giving their money to the initiator ) is an acceptable practice . 
  why would we suddenly draw the line when said advertising is getting really good ? 
  i definitely would n't straight up say `` this is sinister/evil '' , but then neither are guns , cigarette ads or knives . 
  in and itself it 's mass-data driven , personality based advertisement/manipulation which is first and foremost a tool . 
  * however * the discussion of what it is , does , can do and which parts should be put under scrutiny is something that imo should be done in public . 
  that kind of topic should n't be up to you , me or a select few to judge . 
  what i remember roughly off the top of my head is that most sources put her effort as less in both quantity ( 1:5 ) and quality ( welp , cambridge analytica ) than trumps but there were implications as well . 
  would n't be surprised if more groups are trying to push into this but it 's just cambridge analytica that 's the most successful so far . 
  i made a long-winded comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5w99p5/revealed_how_us_billionaire_helped_to_back_brexit/de8iotv/ ) that should add much more sources and context . 
  in short : no , it 's not just all speculation . 
  i tried linking a rather long-winded [ article ] ( https://scout.ai/story/the-rise-of-the-weaponized-ai-propaganda-machine ) about cambridge analytica [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vyo1d/cambridge_analytica_the_rise_of_the_ai_propaganda/ ) the other day on / r/europe but it did n't get much attention . 
  nevertheless i 'll just paste my submission statement here because it contains loads of more infos and sources . 
  _______ tl ; dr : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dd5avxlcc ) is an 11 minute video by the ceo of this company explaining what exactly they 're doing . 
  tl ; dw : a company called [ cambridge analytica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_analytica ) which claims to have helped brexit , ted cruz and donald trump via data mining , data analysis and targeted advertising ( especially on facebook ) is now spreading to europe and the linked article goes in-depth about their methods , approaches and backgrounds . 
  ** this includes the idea of automated tools scanning e.g. 
  facebook likes or other online behavior to develop models based on which a personality can be understood and ultimately influenced by companies for hire without individual consent or even knowledge . 
  ** & nbsp ; * how is this linked to europe ? 
  a [ german-speaking interview ] ( https://www.dasmagazin.ch/2016/12/03/ich-habe-nur-gezeigt-dass-es-die-bombe-gibt/ ) by a swiss magazine in december 2016 that talked about the original creator ( a psychologist named michal kosinski ) of the algorithm this company is based on claims that steve bannon ( board member of cambridge analytica ) has been in contact with marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen , niece of marine lepen and activist for the front national ( fn ) . 
  this has also been a topic in [ various other publications ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/breitbart-donald-trump-expansion-marion-marechal-le-pen-front-national-fn-national-front-a7419521.html ) and also links them together with brexit via someone named [ raheem kassam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raheem_kassam ) , editor-in-chief of breitbart uk . 
  according to an [ english vice article ] ( https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win ) which is based on the swiss interview , while cambridge analytica is not commenting on alleged talks with theresa may , their ceo claims he has received inquiries from switzerland , germany and australia and his company is currently touring european conferences showcasing their success in the united states . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.wired.de/collection/life/nach-cambridge-analytica-wie-arbeiten-die-deutschen-parteien-im-digitalen-wahlkampf ) wired germany article a leading member of the right-wing alternative f\u00fcr deutschland ( afd ) said that they 're debating about which tools they will be using and that `` data analysis or helpful programs that make the daily workload easier '' will most likely be used but also denied that they will use any social bots that automatically make posts . 
  * how credible are all these claims ? 
  what needs to be noted is that according to a [ spiegel online ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/donald-trump-und-die-daten-ingenieure-endlich-eine-erklaerung-mit-der-alles-sinn-ergibt-a-1124439.html ) article most of the claims in the article linked above and other sources are based on comments made by the ceo themselves or people like kosinski who have built the foundation for all of this . 
  it overall needs to be clearly said that we do not know how effective any of these tools really are or if it 's just a marketing gag that cambridge analytica is using to make money . 
  however , what we * do * know is that they 've been on the winning side for brexit , ted cruz 's campaign and donald trumps campaign . 
  we also know that they 're in contact with multiple of the european right-wing populist parties ( they so far exclusively work with ` conservatives ' according to themselves but their ceo also mentioned they 'd work for anyone who 'd hire them ) . 
  if anyone can find clear counter-examples ( or examples ) for what these articles say or suggest that would obviously help all of us along as well . 
  * concluding thoughts : just with all of this in mind alone it might be worth it to get some information out as to what exactly these kinds of automated approaches based on massive collections of data are potentially capable of and how they operate exactly . 
  ** if ** these kinds of methods and approaches become ( or are already ) mainstream the most important aspect is understanding them and being educated about them . 
  at least to me the idea of automated tools scanning my personality via e.g. 
  facebook likes or other online behavior and influencing my choices based on such data is * slightly * concerning to say the least . 
  just to add here , * usually * in past the party schulz belongs to ( spd ) excluded one party on the left spectrum , [ the left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_left_ ( germany \\ ) ) , as a potential partner for a coalition . 
  so far he has n't done that which to me is * the * main reason that i would n't consider voting for schulz at all . 
  if we had elections tomorrow a vote for merkel would mean overall slightly worse approaches but a vote for schulz would mean our most extreme party on the left ( including them having an actual communist wing in the party , wanting to be closer to russia or wanting to demilitarize even further ) can have a shot at a governing position in germany . 
  i 'd rather have some more years of merkel than that personally , even though schulz himself is shaping up to be pretty damn solid . 
  and what fake news do n't get done their [ political campaigns on facebook ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dd5avxlcc ) will . 
  that 's the ceo of cambridge analytica speaking who claims that his company was one of the main driving forces behind brexit , ted cruz and trump . 
  one of their chair members , a certain steve bannon you might have heard of , has been in contact with marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen , niece and supporter of marine . 
  the ceo of cambridge analytica also claims he has received inquiries from switzerland , germany and australia and his company is currently touring european conferences showcasing their success in the united states . 
  i 'm not sure why anyone is genuinely surprised at this point . 
  while this does n't seem to be * normal * it has been going on for ages at this point . 
  i 'm sure you remember the shooting in munich last year ? 
  at that time cnn * literally * made up a witness . 
  sorry , i mean their german speaking editor found said witness by randomly calling stores in the area and coincidentally that was the only witness anyone could find who claimed to have heard the shooter yell [ allahu akbar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omjjibtbgl4 ) . 
  people behind this still work there , there was n't any real outrage because of it that i remember and it was used hundreds of times on reddit alone to support the shooters motives . 
  hell , it 's still being cited as an example of a german coverup . 
  the swiss also seem pretty neutral about either of these things . 
  i like how poland & romania are the two major ones that seem to just live off potatoes & cereals and nothing else . 
  either that or this actually is about cereals made out of potatoes ... 
  i 've heard that before from danes and have seen these stats before , are they released in english anywhere ? 
  what i know from german stats on the issue is that yes , it shows the same thing as you just mentioned on an obvious level . 
  however , bavaria for example also gets rather close when you start excluding offences a native german ca n't commit ( makes sense ) , exclude tourists ( that 's another 10 % that shows up in our crimerate of foreigners ) and exclude illegals ( that 's another 10-15 % of the total crime committed by non-germans ) . 
  if you then look at all the remaining people and compare them to natives in similar circumstances you do get pretty damn close . 
  sure , one now can argue that these stats should n't be excluded but i do consider at least those groups above as important to distinct when we 're looking at migrants/refugees specifically . 
  another thing is that while for example in one state ( baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ) 44 % of people in prisons are foreigners ( overall german average is still high compared to the eu with 30 % ) the largest increase in 2016 came from [ maghreb states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maghreb ) and the highest numbers overall are from turkey and romania - again not what we associate with the migrant crisis . 
  another example is that for example if we look at crime committed by migrants since september 2015 we find that most crimes ( 25 % ) were committed by syrians but then they 're 50 % of the total amount of people that came here since then - the people who are responsible for a much larger proportion of crime are kosovarians , serbs , albanians , macedonians , eritreans and nigerians . 
  overall the picture over here seems to be that while yes , there are massive issues they 're not the ones most commonly used to justify anti-migrant viewpoints or straight up right-wing propaganda . 
  it definitely does n't seem as simple as it 's sometimes made out to be . 
  e : it should also be noted that we have a [ decade of data ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_in_sweden#victim_surveys ) during which reports of sex crimes and reported cases went up while * actual * rapes stayed constant due to various factors . 
  what that means is that while yes , an increase in the former two stats during the migrant crisis * can * mean more actual rape cases but it * does n't have to * . 
  there 's precedent for the two being completely unrelated . 
  sorry , i must have misunderstood you there :  what i am talking about that when things really get out of hand , ** european men will be forced to stop being fucking cucks ** , and i have faith that they will .
