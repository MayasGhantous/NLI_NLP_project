  the afd-voting regions are the biggest benefactor of eu funds . 
  them saying `` if we would leave the eu we would have more money for this ! '', 
  ( which is the angle you 're coming from ) might be correct but it 's completely irrational that it 's coming from them , not from other areas which benefit less from these funds . 
   but in the uk we have a different democracy with an entirely different tradition , constitution and history . 
  our constitution is an evolving organic one in which the balance between the people , parliament , government , the courts , the monarchy , the church , the press gradually change over time . 
  we have no set principle that there should be no referendums , but an openness to having them in certain circumstances and this was one of those circumstances . 
  that might be a good spot to learn something then since you 're definitely right : i 'm assuming you guys have a similar democratic history as we do in this case . 
  how often and for what kinds of things does the uk hold these kinds of referendums ? 
  _____  this one we knew was important , which is why turnout was high . 
  especially in light of the recent trump election i 've heard time and time again that `` similar to brexit '' turnout was low because `` people thought hillary would win anyway '' . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/how-did-turnout-affect-the-eu-referendum-result/ ) turnout for brexit was 72 % while [ this ] ( http://www.ukpolitical.info/turnout45.htm ) says turnout in the 2015 election was 66 % . 
  ca n't really blame that part if turnout actually went up . 
  i guess i fell for some propaganda there myself , thanks for pointing that out . 
  < 3 _______  cultures are changing things . 
  i just do n't think , when we look at the evidence of the referendum or the actual consequence of brexit , that you really believe that something terrible happened . 
  nah , i do n't think something terrible happened when we think of the actual outcome . 
  i was however under the impressions that these things were n't a common thing in the uk , falsely assumed turnout was low and remembered all the drama around the nhs bus-stories , the referendum only existing in the first place to please a smaller party and similar things that overall suggested it was not a topic on which the uk public was terribly well informed , or at least as well informed as it should have been . 
  also the idea of people like nigel farage pushing hard for brexit and then stepping down because `` i got what i wanted now someone else figure out how to actually do it please '' left a rather sour taste overall . 
  on top of that [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tzvjm/after_passing_worst_surveillance_law_in_a/ ) kinds of news or [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tzvjm/after_passing_worst_surveillance_law_in_a/ddqcf48/ ) comment chains on the nhs suggest there was much more to brexit than `` no worries we just want out of the eu . '', 
  ______  this will be good for the eu too . 
  now you actually have to take reform seriously . 
  no more empty words . 
  actions . 
  that 's pretty much how i see it from that perspective . 
  felt like the uk did n't * really * want to align with continental ideas rather often in comparison . 
   germany is a net contributor to the eu , hence they could easily replace those funds if they 've left . 
  i 'm very much pro-eu , but these are ` alternative facts ' . 
  same bullshit piece of trivia keeps circling about regions in the uk receiving eu help . 
  by definition it means that every cent contributed from the german areas ** not ** receiving similarly high benefits will benefit ** more ** from leaving the eu than those areas that are currently receiving funds . 
  how is it an alternative fact that the areas that currently give the most votes for an anti-eu party are the biggest benefactors of eu funds in germany right now ? 
   separately , the referendum was not some sudden whim !, 
  it had been brewing for years . 
  sorry if i misspoke , that 's not what i meant . 
  what i meant is that we 're not used to direct democracy . 
  we 're not used to every single vote being absolutely crucial for the future of our country , we 're not even used to our vote having a specific , well defined consequence . 
  ______ i 'm by no means saying `` wrawra this would have never happened , all brexit voters are uneducated retards wrawra '' , i 'm saying that we have no cultural precedence for those kinds of referendums which is why , by definition , we 're all going to be terrible at them and will be prone to actions that are irrational to someone who would be competent with this form of governance . 
  it * should * be how a liberal democracy should function but we 're in no way shape or form prepared for that kind of approach . 
  durp , i 'm just bad . 
  i thought you only linked to one of the parties . 
  i 'll edit that request out , all good !, 
  from my point of view it stems from a fundamentally different approach to politics and especially voters . 
  for example , afd leadership is against the eu . 
  they find ways to address the * feelings * of their voters by appealing to basic fears and desires . 
  they cherry pick and distort facts wherever they can but the main instrument is convincing people that they ca n't trust * those other people up there * . 
  that 's why the whole `` mass media is brainwashing '' and similar rhetoric is so key in what we 're currently seeing . 
  _________ the target group are ** not ** extremists in general , the target group are people who , for their entire lives , have never felt like they 're smart/educated/competent / meaningful enough to contribute to politics . 
  now there 's a group that says : `` we 're like you and * those up there * have failed you all your lives . '', 
  - that resonates . 
  because if they never actively participated but let those `` others '' deal with it and now everything is * worse * then those guys must be right with what they 're saying . 
  if they now explain that the eu is part of the problem , their new base will believe it . 
  you and me live in countries where protest votes and `` x will happen anyway '' are ingrained as hell in our culture and political process . 
  i 'm all for more direct democracy in general but i 'm extremely against direct democracy for specific events when the entire culture is completely different otherwise . 
  you ca n't trust the people ( including myself ) to make specific decisions when our entire lives we learned how to vote for directions and leave the specific decisions up to professionals . 
  we 're simply not competent enough . 
  you tell them that can accept that they 're cold and tell them that you 'd like them to explain better why they 're cold . 
  ask them to convince you with data that * you * should feel cold too . 
  if they 're convinced it 's 5 \u00b0 c because they * feel * cold they should be able to list evidence for said claim . 
  recognize when they say `` it 's 5 \u00b0 c '' but mean `` i feel like it 's 5 \u00b0 c '' and differentiate based on that . 
  _______ figure out if they 're actual extremists who create and spread this type of bullshit because of an inherent ideology or whether they 're parroting these things but actually are n't all that bad people in general . 
  extremists are completely irrelevant in any discussion . 
  what matters is convincing the more moderates that your position is grounded in reality and facts and they were convinced by people who appealed to their * feelings * instead . 
   well there is no real thing you can do about it . 
  [ ... ]  trying to appease people who are living a fantasy world is just going to weaken yourself . 
  education , information , media presence . 
  who cares that the eu has a [ site ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) that lists myths spread about the eu , a [ task force ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ ) that deals specifically with pro-kremlin propaganda or extremely well done [ graphics and overviews ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm#projects ) of what eu money actually * does * for each individual country when no one knows about it ? 
  facts matter . 
  reality matters . 
  if one side is grounded in reality and facts and the other finds ways to make up completely ridiculous claims then it has to be addressed by ordinary people like you and me whenever we see it stand out whether it 's online or in our daily lives . 
  accept * feelings * about problems as real and relevant , because they are . 
  learn how to recognize when people say `` i know x '' but mean `` i * feel * x '' . 
  find ways to split the emotional side from the rational and work from there . 
  for anyone else curious these two parties * combined * got [ 13 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_general_election,_2014#results ) in the last swedish election . 
  they individually got similar results ( 6.9 % +6.11 % ) to the swedish [ left party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left_party_ ( sweden \\ ) ) ( 5.7 % ) or the german [ die linke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_left_ ( germany \\ ) ) ( 8,6 % ) . 
  in comparison the current polling result for the german [ afd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alternative_for_germany ) for the 2017 election is between 9 % and 12 % . 
  ____________ just thought i 'd write that up real quick . 
  while i can accept that the post i 'm replying to can substantiate `` mainstream political groups '' advocating for this it 's definitely a fringe movement , even if we look at the cited swedish examples and even if we combine them . 
   when putin kicks the bucket that or when the current series of conquest victories comes to a halt . 
  that 's why the situation in belarus makes me feel so uneasy . 
  i 'll reserve that for the events in and around belarus that i 'm expecting in the near future . 
  doing such a thing with a simple majority and no backup plan if the result is close feels so irresponsible to me . 
  if the swiss do that with a culture and history that is built around it , fine , why not - i 'm a fan . 
  but i doubt there is any other country that can afford to do this just randomly from time to time . 
   i ca n't help to notice parallels between the behaviours of mice and human populations , which scares me in unlimited human population growth . 
  nah , that 's a much smaller issue compared to how complex systems in general behave . 
  be prepared to be even more scared than before . 
  the less agents ( aka individual `` units '' which can be groups of things depending on context ) any given complex system has and the less connected they are the more stable , predictable and linear any given system will behave . 
  the more agents any given complex system has and the more connected they are the more unstable , unpredictable and chaotic any given system will behave . 
  _________ that , in a nutshell , is from my point of view what you 're seeing today with the advent of the internet . 
  that 's why the smallest ideas , values or beliefs can spread like wildfire across the globe . 
  odds are it 's going to be much , much worse before humans figure out a way of dealing with this in general . 
  if we ever do . 
  that assumes current trends in terms of progress will at least stay stable . 
  interesting sidenote , a decent chunk of eu funds germany receives ( 35 % ) are * still * going towards east germany : http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/de/index_en.cfm#projects coincidentally our afd who is also anti-eu is strongest in those regions . 
  sigh . 
   as part of the improvement of the ** a72 motorway between chemnitz and leipzig ** , a new four lane stretch was built between rathensdorf and borna . 
  ( ... ) ( eu funding : eur 76.5 million which represents 56 % of the total costs )  the new railway line between ** erfurt , halle and leipzig ** ( ... ) ( eu funding : eur 49.9 million which represents about 47 % of the total costs )  the new railway bridge over the danube , between landshut and bayrisch eisenstein ( ... ) ( eu funding : eur 5.7 million ), 
   yet '' hijab '' has already gone into mainstream in european societies to be known as veils or other head-dresses of purely islamic style . 
  not in germany , not in this context . 
  it 's imprecise and everyone knows it . 
  equating `` hijab '' with `` niqab '' for example is something i 've mostly seen by the extreme-right to create a false sense of equivalency .
