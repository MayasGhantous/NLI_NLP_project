  also in this sub the distinction stays equally important . 
  ______ quote me :  what you ( hopefully ) meant were burkas and niqabs . 
  quote you :  obviously . 
  people do n't have problems with other people voluntarly covering their hair . 
  * you * started agreeing with me first !, 
  =p ______ let 's try this again : [ picture ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/5785816/data/what-are-the-differences-between-the-burka,-niqab-and-hijab-data.jpg ) . 
  i fully support banning niqabs and burkas . 
  i 'm fully against banning of the hijab , chador or dupatta . 
  that position has a very simple reasoning - practicality . 
  my other options are this : * a ) i ban ** all ** clothing that looks even remotely like the above . 
  now i 'm hitting my own citizens and my own culture with this law and i 'm hitting lots of things that are simply fashion and hence covered under freedom of expression . 
  i just introduced a law against specific female clothing . 
  fuck that . 
  * b ) i ban the above specifically ** in a religious context ** or ** if used by religious people ** . 
  now , probably even worse , i created loopholes that religious people can flock around while also alienating them . 
  they can for example , officially , leave churches and then still practice their religion including the clothing and my law is completely ineffective . 
  if you have an idea that bans ** all ** religious clothing articles ( including christian or jewish ones ) without running into one of the issues above or freedom of religion as a fundamental principle of western societies i 'm all ears . 
  `` volksverhetzung '' = '' [ incitement to hatred ] ( http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html\\#p1241 ) '' apparently , but i 've also used them analogue before . 
  i * think * it might be worth being more precise here because e.g. 
  americans like to understand `` hate speech '' as `` anything hateful against another person '' and then freeze-peach slogans are usually next . 
  germany for example is rather precise around the whole ( comparatively vague ) `` disturbing peace '' idea and defines these laws around other things like e.g. 
  `` verleumdung '' , '' \u00fcble nachrede '' or `` betrug '' being relevant in other cases . 
  there 's probably a similar official english translation for you guys that defines your laws within the umbrella of `` hate speech '' to avoid confusion among these pesky foreigners . 
  also , [ til ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/verhetzung\\#ab_j.c3.a4nner_2016 ) you just recently changed your laws with better definitions than we have imo and the [ swiss ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/rassismus-strafnorm ) are just straight up a different direction if i understand it correctly :  um nach dieser vorschrift strafbar zu sein , m\u00fcssen sich hass und diskriminierung auf die rasse , ethnie oder religion von personen beziehen . 
  you were close : http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1241  incitement ** to ** hatred [ wiki ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/volksverhetzung#geschichte ) has some more info that looks decent , i personally for example did n't know that until 1994 holocaust denial fell under \u00a7 185 ( insults ) . 
  english version of that page also has a few more infos . 
   volksverhetzung is punishable in germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-german citizens , if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within german territory , e.g. , the seditious sentiment was expressed in german writing or speech and made accessible in germany ( german criminal code 's principle of ubiquity , section 9 \u00a7 1 alt . 
  3 and 4 of the strafgesetzbuch ) . 
  no , not obviously . 
  do n't say `` hijabs '' if you mean something else entirely . 
  this way you 're making me , as someone who fully agrees with what you * actually * are asking for , question whether you 're : * a ) an extremist . 
  * b ) uneducated about the issue you 're talking about . 
  * c ) all of the above and only spouting something you heard elsewhere . 
  all of this can be avoided if you communicate what you actually * mean * . 
  language matters , it 's bad enough that we 're all talking in something else than our mother-tongue , we ca n't afford to also use the wrong words for things . 
  i 'm referring to the fundamental difference between the us and for example germany with regards to in what order they see certain priorities . 
  to me that 's a fundamental difference that , given enough time , will lead to certain results . 
  the us as a whole has very , very few limits on free speech , freedom of religion and freedom of the press . 
  that 's one of * the * highest priorities in the american system overall . 
  germany on the other hand considers itself a so called [ militant democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) . 
  the very foundation rests on the idea that the absolute highest value of the nation as a whole is ** upholding ** the liberal and democratic order . 
  that 's why for example the article referring to freedom of expression in the german constitution looks like this :  article 5  [ freedom of expression , arts and sciences ]  ( 1 ) every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech , writing and pictures , and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources . 
  freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed . 
  there shall be no censorship . 
   ( 2 ) ** these rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws ** , in provisions for the protection of young persons , and in the right to personal honour . 
   ( 3 ) arts and sciences , research and teaching shall be free . 
  ** the freedom of teaching shall not release any person from allegiance to the constitution . 
  ** _______ the reason for this very specific exception being part of the actual constitution is rather simple in itself . 
  the fundamental idea is that to * guarantee * things like freedom of expression or being a democratic state in the long run you ** need ** to be able to legally work against people and organisations who have the stated goal to attack freedom of expression or democracy itself . 
  in the us i can have an organisation like the kkk , a communist party or a nazi party and free speech laws protect me . 
  in germany all of these things can be illegal ( note : the requirement to ban a party are also by design higher than the above but the framework also exists - it was only used against a successor party of the nsdap and against a communist party so far ) . 
  analogue even the [ german press codex ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) ( which is how the press self-regulates ) declares its duty `` within the framework of the constitution and constitutional law '' . 
  _______ all of this is based on one simple chain of thought : if any movement that actively aims to destroy democracy or basic values ( such as freedom of expression ) is allowed to grow freely then given enough time it has a * chance * to become a large enough movement to overthrow democracy or these specific values . 
  now , admittedly some of these approaches still have to adapt to the ( dis - ) information age but overall i 'm rather hopeful that if there 's a country that can figure this out faster than any other it should be germany because her entire state apparatus was designed to be efficient in this direction . 
  the premise is that anti-democratic forces , by definition , do n't agree to work under the same rules and will always have excess to tools that those who value the constitution wo n't have . 
  to me the essence of this is ** the ** lesson germany learned from its history . 
  _________ if you leave free speech or the press completely unregulated then , given enough time , what people today agree on as basic , democratic values will be thrown out and eliminated from either the extreme left or the extreme right . 
  while seeing what we 've been seeing in the us since probably a decade now culminate in the current administration i learned to appreciate and value that perspective . 
  correct , that 's why both right and left leaning outlets are part of the german press culture . 
   `` we 've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to general flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks , trying to ascertain the truth , '' spicer said . 
   however , trump did not ask for his resignation until monday . 
  the president 's trust in flynn `` had eroded to a point where he felt he needed to make a change , '' spicer told reporters . 
  the obvious extreme anti-trump bias that ** quoting the fucking white house press secretary who straight up contradicted trump gives ** ? 
  it even adds `` says white house '' to what you quoted . 
  you got ta be kidding me . 
  __________ i ca n't even fathom that you 're using this to show * me * how delusional * i * am and how `` anti-trump '' such a report is . 
  * person a says friday : `` i do n't know about claim x. '', 
  * person b says today : '' ** we ** ( including person a ) have been reviewing and evaluating issue x on a daily basis ** for a few weeks ** . '', 
  ** these two claims can not exist in the same reality without one of them being untrue . 
  durp you 're right , english is hard . 
  thanks for clarifying . 
  ___  the most popular swiss film is about this actually , it 's called `` die schweizermacher '' [ `` the swissmakers '' / eng wiki / deu wiki ] . 
  a film about two officers who decide which people get the swiss passport or not . 
  holy shit i forgot emil is a thing . 
  man , when i was younger i was always embarrassed when my grandparents threw that guy at me but nowadays i came to appreciate that kind of humor . 
  there 's still some compact cassettes of that guy around here * somewhere * ... 
  i 've got some suspicions as for what direction that book will go in but it 's ordered nevertheless . 
  thanks for the recommendation !, 
  their immigration laws are really `` weird '' from an international point of view but i love them . 
  in a nutshell swiss as a country sets rather rough guidelines ( had to have lived in switzerland for 12 + years with a few modifiers depending on age , having a swiss partner etc. ), 
  and ** everything else ** is decided on a cantonal level . 
  in some areas you need locals speaking for you , in others specific guidelines on what languages you need to speak , in some areas you had to have lived for 15 years , in others for 2 years . 
  at least on paper i think that 's an amazing system that means an immigrant has to be well-informed about the region he picks and he has to be adjusted to the local area and accepted by the local population before he 's allowed to live there . 
  ________ in general i 'm a fan of direct democracy in switzerland and maybe some swiss people can tell me why it 's not all that amazing / even better than i 'm thinking it is . 
  at least from my point of view from talking to people and reading up on it switzerland is easily the most democratic country on earth . 
  ___ e : oh and their fortifications are amazing .

  [ archive link ] ( http://archive.is/awuzc#selection-2077.50-2077.77 ) ) police is investigating him for [ `` vort\u00e4uschung einer straftat '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/vort%c3%a4uschen_einer_straftat ) which is basically `` faking a crime '' . 
  up to three years in prison or fines if it 's not already covered as `` false accusation '' or `` obstruction of justice '' . 
  to my knowledge , in this specific case : no . 
  it * was * however posted on bild.de ( [ here a different link with some pictures of the article ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/86448/bild-fuettert-rechte-hetzer-mit-sex-mob-geruecht/ ) ) in german and spread like wildfire through the usual german right wing channels like the [ afd ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/wp-content/fressgassmob13.jpg ) / [ afd youth ] ( http://www.bildblog.de/wp-content/fressgassmob12.jpg ) party twitters , ( and at least one regular german tv channel : sat .1 ) .
