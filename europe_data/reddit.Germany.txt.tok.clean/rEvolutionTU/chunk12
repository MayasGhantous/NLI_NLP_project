  it also spread across the usual suspects like breitbart uk , express.co.uk , epoch times and facebook/twitter . 
  the difference is that while bild now posted their [ correction ] ( http://www.bild.de/news/inland/news-inland/in-eigener-sache-keine-mobartigen-uebergriffe-50428332.bild.html ) and an apology ( because as much as that outlet sucks it still overall in general most of the time sticks to the good ol' [ german press codex ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) ) , you most likely wo n't see one being posted by the outlets that initially spread the story without double-checking it . 
  that 's why at least i personally do n't mind a correction getting some views on / r/europe even though the initial thing did n't come through here , maybe that 's an understandable position . 
   i think one of the biggest problems is the modern thinking of `` you ca n't interfere with their culture ! '', 
  and labelling any anti strict islam talk as racist . 
  it makes any adult conversation about it difficult and any government ruling almost impossible without a backlash . 
  i 've honestly never seen that often cited behavior in germany in the wild . 
  on reddit ? 
  sure , sometimes , but definitely less than people claiming how much of an issue it is . 
  i 'm simple , i think everyone who is against fundamental german basic values is an issue that needs to be dealt with appropriately and through the proper channels . 
  whether that 's islamists , christian supremacists , neo-nazis , people who want to shoot neo-nazis , people who advocate shooting refugees at the border , people who advocate completely closed borders for certain countries or people who want american-like free speech in germany , i genuinely do n't care . 
  i like our fundamental laws and values . 
   but i will not for even a moment pretend that islam is part of my culture , because it 's not it 's not part of ** my ** culture either but , quite frankly , neither is judaism , buddhism or hinduism . 
  but for example the * dialogue * with jewish people is part of my culture . 
  i 've had more experiences with what i * think * what are muslims ( most turks i know for example are n't in your face about it but on average roughly half of them have to be muslims ) than any other non-christian religion however and the unpleasant ones i recall were in situations where i 've seen similar shit from eastern european immigrants or native germans . 
  overall i do n't * mind * moderate religious people however , especially since , despite all their problems , i overall appreciate what the christian churches are doing in germany . 
   i always found it odd the way people romanticised the uk despite it being objectively a shit country . 
   my guess is the same reason people do it about the us , being able to understand english and simply watching some tv shows and stuff have made people forget the horribly crimes we 're guilty of . 
  i think especially in younger history brits got away with a ** lot ** because others did worse stuff or similar stuff more recently . 
  slavery ? 
  people think of the us - or ancient rome . 
  concentration camps ? 
  people think of nazi germany . 
  fucking up the middle east ? 
  people think of the us even though we can trace the issues in the region at least partially back to [ brits and french ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitioning_of_the_ottoman_empire#background ) after ww1 . 
  also : you won the last world wars . 
  that 's probably the most impactful reason as to why the world does n't know or care * that * much . 
  i knew about that one , most likely because on average it 's more likely to be confronted with american things rather than british things online . 
  it 's definitely disgusting as hell and pretty much completely ignored by americans / the us as a whole . 
  i have n't learned about either in school though - actually i do n't recall learning about any genocide in the 20th/19th century apart from the holocaust . 
  things like japanese internment camps in the us were n't mentioned either . 
  hell i did n't learn about the german genocide on the [ herero people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herero_and_namaqua_genocide ) more than 110 years ago either . 
  germany has n't acknowledged that one until 2016 . 
  between 2011 and 2014 we gave back about 3000 skulls tho !, 
  there 's currently ( again ) a lawsuit going on by the descendants claiming compensation . 
  disclaimer , my french is pretty horrid at this point in time so i was just parroting along what i was told by friends , hoping to get some decent answers if i said anything completely outrageous . 
  as for schulz his first official interview as a chancellor candidate ( which was like 3 days after the announcement ) was incredibly bad and content-less . 
  most of what he said was just falling back on old rhetoric of his party . 
  that 's where most of the initial resentment in that direction was coming from . 
  now the fact that / r/the _ schulz is a thing made it through our media and that instantly brought up more comparisons because of the whole `` something something internet fame populism oh shit trump fuck fuck fuck '' - connection . 
  so overall from the german perspective , especially considering his history as a politician , those comparisons * are * pretty baseless overall . 
   what now ? 
  now there will be people who believe that people in general are capable of changing and there will be people who will believe that people in general are incapable of changing . 
  based on the history of my country i 'm firmly in the former camp . 
   no one will say this out of a fear of sounding '' racist '' , but they are . 
  they do not fit in european societies just as nazi clothing does not fit . 
  there 's a reason there is huge support for banning these pieces of clothing . 
  agreed , [ this ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/eine-alte-frau-bietet-auf-einem-markt-in-vilnius-wilna-stiefmtterchen-picture-id543848509 ) or [ this ] ( http://img.fotocommunity.com/fraenkische-baeuerin-04befa51-f2d6-4130-86cd-2b4739deb09f.jpg?height=1000 ) type of clothing does n't fit into european societies . 
  i mean look at these nazis . 
  i 'm glad you 're speaking up and are n't afraid of being called `` racist '' !, 
  irony aside what you ( hopefully ) meant were [ burkas and niqabs ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/5785816/data/what-are-the-differences-between-the-burka,-niqab-and-hijab-data.jpg ) . 
  thanks for sharing this !, 
   europe must realize that this is an ideological battle in the hearts and minds of parts of its own population this so much . 
  * that * is why pretending that everyone in the group of `` muslim '' is incompatible or some form of terrorist is so dangerous . 
  not just for them , but for us as well . 
  isis and similar organisations ** want ** us to do this because it 's perfectly in line with their goals . 
  these reformists need all the support we can give them , we 're against a common enemy after all . 
  radical islamism is a threat to every single person in the west living happy lives , * especially * muslims who do so . 
  the quote that i think needs to repeated again and again is this :  journalist rukmini maria callimachi also emphasises isil 's interest in polarization or in eliminating what it calls the `` grey zone '' between the black ( non-muslims ) and white ( isil ) . 
  `` the gray is moderate muslims who are living in the west and are happy and feel engaged in the society here . '',

   while setting up concentration camps in kenya `` wtf ? 
  let me google that shit . '', 
   the projected costs of the swynnerton plan were too high for the cash-strapped colonial government , so baring tweaked repatriation and augmented the swynnerton plan with plans for a massive expansion of the pipeline coupled with a system of work camps to make use of detainee labour . 
  interesting ...  there were originally two types of works camps envisioned by baring : the first type were based in kikuyu districts with the stated purpose of achieving the swynnerton plan ; the second were punitive camps , designed for the 30,000 mau mau suspects who were deemed unfit to return to the reserves . 
  these forced-labour camps provided a much needed source of labour to continue the colony 's infrastructure development . 
  hmm ... 30k forced laborers but what the hell was he saying about concentration camps ? 
   in response to the rebellion , many kikuyu were relocated . 
  ** between 320,000-450 ,000 of them were moved into concentration camps . 
  ** most of the remainder - more than a million - were held in `` enclosed villages '' . 
  although some were mau mau guerillas , many were victims of collective punishment that colonial authorities imposed on large areas of the country . 
  thousands suffered beatings and sexual assaults during `` screenings '' intended to extract information about the mau mau threat . 
  later , prisoners suffered even worse mistreatment in an attempt to force them to renounce their allegiance to the insurgency and to obey commands . 
  significant numbers were murdered ; there are reports of some prisoners being roasted alive . 
  prisoners were questioned with the help of `` slicing off ears , boring holes in eardrums , flogging until death , pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight , and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes '' . 
  castration by british troops and denying access to medical aid to the detainees were also widespread and common . 
   among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was hussein onyango obama , the grandfather of barack obama , the president of the united states . 
  according to his widow , british soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated . 
  well .

  after all , what has the european convention on human rights [ ever done for them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptfmay6m6aa ) ? 
   not because i dont believe in a european union , but i doubt we should ever have allowed weak and disorganizes countries like iberia , france , italy and greece ** join ** . 
  whoops , i totally missed that part of his comment . 
  yeah , definitely . 
  i do miss those cheap vacations over there tho now that they caught up . 
  =( ... if only we had some kind of trans-european broadcasting channel that would send shows in multiple languages so we can learn more random shit about each other . 
   eu recently and eu left elitists are leaning too far left . 
  this is the reason for creation of right wing counter part . 
  i 'm trying really and genuinely hard to see your perspective here , but so far as actual evidence you 've presented the refugee crisis which explains the german right but not the polish and polish pig farmers losing their job due to eu regulations - while poland is the biggest benefactor of eu funds . 
  how is that `` too far left leaning '' ? 
   even our super right wing goverment knows eu is needed and is n't for it 's destruction both lepen and the german afd are for the destruction of the eu / the exit of their respective countries , so yes i 'm talking about the `` extreme right '' . 
  _______  i just think you , left leaning people and eu politicians do n't realize where the right wing extremism comes from and how to fight it . 
  you see if eu tries to silence right wing opinions , you will just strenghten them and thats whats happening right now . 
  cornered animals attack if they have no other options . 
  in summary your idea is that countries went too far left and by accepting classic right-wing concepts the extremists will go away , right ? 
  lepen in france is a thing since more than a decade now . 
  the german afd is built pretty much exclusively around [ pegida ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pegida ) , who formed around the charlie hebdo attacks and since are almost exclusively riding the classic german right-wing topics on the backs of the refugee crisis while cloaking themselves as pretty nice people . 
  neither of these things is directly related to france or germany leaning further left with regards to policies .
