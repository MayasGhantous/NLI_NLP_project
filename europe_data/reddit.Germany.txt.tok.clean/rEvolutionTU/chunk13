  france did n't even take in syrian refugees . 
  neither did poland . 
  ____ i really , honestly do n't see evidence for your theory . 
  maybe we need another angle . 
  what is a `` right-wing populist '' to you , in poland ? 
  actually hold on . 
  what is `` centrist '' to you ? 
  to me ( and the majority of germans ) centrist includes equal gay rights , environmentalism ( e.g. 
  a focus on renewables ) , pro-eu sentiment , kids having universal access to daycare , parents being able to equally take an extended sick leave ( aka mother and father having similar rights ) . 
  is this where you 're about to tell me you consider the above list as left-leaning from a polish perspective ? 
  overall , over here this is n't a `` lean '' that happened suddenly . 
  that 's our center . 
  he 's [ dutch ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tze6x/every_one_of_the_eus_28_member_economies_is/ddqa4g7/ ) and most comments i 've seen in this thread were pretty reasonable so i was a bit surprised scrolling over this discussion about `` weak and disorganized '' countries . 
  maybe just give him a chance and throw sourced facts in his face . 
  i * think * he did n't mean syndicalism but that actual unions overall have more power than the government . 
  not exactly sure either . 
  so you 're saying that mass media lied to us about the refugee numbers ? 
  holy shit , breitbart was right all along !, 
   contrary to what some people try to make them believe , poland has benefited tremendously from eu membership . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm#projects this site usually wins regarding these topics . 
  can also just mix up the url to learn more about another countries relationships with the eu !, 
  it 's okay just grab a white flag and it will all go away . 
  if someone spreads dumb clich\u00e9es i just wanted it to be from someone that appreciates you . 
   either dismantle the eu or turn it into a fiscal union with transfers of wealth amongst member states . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pt/index_en.cfm#projects hmmm ... 
   that 's the thing though ; what makes money/market share is being first . 
  and that 's fine - if wrong or misleading information is corrected responsibly . 
  to ensure that we need rules , guidelines and responsible journalism . 
  public broadcasting plays its part right there . 
  one could also argue that the issue in the first place is that people get their news from facebook even if it 's not actual news but that 's another story . 
   using public funds on for-profit organizations opens so many cans of worms that it pretty much spoils the whole meal . 
  gotcha , that makes sense . 
  my erection is hereby officially withdrawn . 
  & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ i 'd ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ love ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ able ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ click ^ ^ ^ around ^ ^ ^ commentary ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ various ^ ^ ^ languages . 
   a minimum of 6 square meters for boar and 2.5 meters for the sow . 
  lighting at least 40 lux ( illumination ) for 8 hours a day , the highest noise at 85 decibels that 's what i get out of that article : the above rules are eu regulations that need to be complied with and 10-15 % of pig farmers are expected to lose their jobs in that industry as a direct result . 
  you consider that a destructive action . 
  i full agree . 
  that 'd be fucking terrible and i 'd be pissed if i was polish and that 's all the eu would be doing to my country because effectively an eu regulation costs the jobs of polish people . 
  ___________ now , please click around [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm#projects ) please . 
  especially `` where does the money go ? '', 
  now lets take a look at `` the eu budget and poland '' : * for example , as the development of an effective transport network is essential to a successful economy , the eu contributed pln 5.4 billion ( eur 1.3 billion ) to extend the a1 motorway and improve links between polish regions , but also improve connections between poland and its european neighbours . 
  * 75 % of polish exports went to eu countries in 2013 . 
  * the polish growth rate increased from 51 % in 2004 to 68 % of the eu average in 2013 . 
  * every year , around ** 1.4 million polish farmers receive income support from the eu budget ** , and the agricultural income per worker increased by almost 45 % between 2004 , when the country joined the eu , and 2012 . 
  * the eu contributed ** $ 16.2 billion ** or ** pln 68.5 billion ** to poland overall in 2013 alone . 
  _______ _______ with all this information , please take a look at what you said a few hours ago :  problem with politicians but especially the ones in brussels is ** they have no idea how an average simple people in europe live ** . 
  they live in ** their fairy tale world paid by taxes telling easy words about cooperation and solidarity ** . 
  their decisions have real life consequences , but ** it 's not the politicians who feel them . 
  it 's us the people . 
  **  this is where the right wing comes . 
  and it 's not because of putin , nostalgia , racism or idiocy whatever else you name it . 
  ** they realize the needs of people who still have problems ** , and it 's not some miniscule number . 
  it 's really sometimes ** the majority of countries that want something better from life and wo n't get that from the elitist left goverments . 
  ** _____ _____ ** all ** of the above money that , among others german and french tax payers ( personally speaking : happily so ) helped built up is thanks to these `` elitist left gouvernments '' . 
  ** all ** of the above is threatened by the `` right wing '' that wants to tear the eu apart . 
  ________ that 's what all those politicians in brussels who live in `` their fairy tale world '' made possible for poland and we 're ** exclusively ** talking about one single year in recent history . 
  not necessarily because every german , french , spanish , italian or any other citizen wanted it so . 
  but because overall the majority of the citizens in the eu managed to elect leaders that had enough weight in brussels to do the thing they consider the right thing to do to make lives for average polish citizens as amazing as for me right here in germany . 
  in return the expectation is that when the same values and principles that make this kind of subvention possible need ** your ** help to deal with a crisis that they 're respected just the same . 
  ________ the very same `` elite '' that did n't ask our right-wing populists whether they want to spend money to make poland a better place to live for polish citizens did n't ask your right-wing populists whether helping during a refugee crisis is the right thing to do or not . 
  ___________ but they ** did ** respect it when the polish government said `` nope , fuck that '' . 
  i think that state is unacceptable . 
  we 're in europe together . 
  our peace depends on your peace , your wealth depends on our wealth . 
  the values that help make you a wealthier country are the same that feel us compelled to help during a refugee crisis if we can do something about it . 
  you fully agree with the [ australian treatment ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/13/international-criminal-court-told-australias-detention-regime-could-be-a-against-humanity ) of refugees ? 
  by electing officials that would want precisely that , you 'll be electing officials that would have given zero fucks about any development in poland if we would have elected their counterparts a few years earlier . 
   you want to take their money and spend it in a way that you think is better than the way they are currently spending the money they worked for . 
  we already do this for public education in schools and universities because the state has a vested interest in its people being well-informed and educated . 
  the question that needs to be asked : is this overall beneficial to a society or not ? 
  if yes , it 's still reasonable to literally force everyone living in such a society to contribute . 
  just because ** i ** think we should spend less on education or that our roads would be totally fine with less money there does n't mean i can use that reasoning to exempt myself from it . 
  a well-educated and informed public is integral to a functioning democracy . 
  if public broadcasting companies support that goal they 're a great spot to use tax money . 
  ________  how would you measure whether it benefits society ? 
  who will be the judge ? 
  that 's a great question . 
  i do n't know off-hand . 
  how do we measure that public schools and universities benefit society ? 
  ________  the issue may be that there is not enough demand for such content . 
  partially i 'd say . 
  the issue that private media has is that it ** has ** to be profitable to do its job . 
  that means it ** has ** to sell well to both the public and to advertisers . 
  just because [ bild.de ] ( http://www.bild.de/ ) sells well does n't mean it is a `` better product '' for society at large compared to e.g. 
  [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 ) . 
  capitalism and a free market only works to a certain extent . 
  this creates a massive issue whenever advertisement , public demand and public interest clash . 
  one way these issues are addressed is via laws , rules and [ guidelines ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) . 
  another are non-profit organisations and foundations/charities . 
  and another one is the state itself investing money into something which brings us back to the first point : ** a well educated and informed public being crucial for a functioning democracy . 
  ** ____________  so they want a state funded propaganda arm of the eu , as if there is a lack of pro-eu media . 
  first of all there is a massive difference between * propaganda * and * correcting propaganda * . 
  one should be considered bad whether it 's pro-eu or anti-eu . 
  the latter is integral to defending democracy . 
  look at [ this list for example ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) . 
  most of it is an official , factual correction by the eu to clarify false or misleading things that were said in the media . 
  let 's take [ this ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/no-brussels-is-not-calling-for-italians-to-produce-mozzarella-using-powdered-milk/ ) here specifically as an example . 
  that 's not `` pro-eu propaganda '' , that 's `` countering lies '' . 
  how many people read the story in the daily mail , the times and financial times ?
