  how many people heard about the correction from the eu itself ? 
  that 's a spot where the suggestion makes complete sense . 
  _______  i see it in our national broadcaster . 
  they suck up to whatever government is currently in power . 
  they buy football broadcasting rights for millions of euros . 
  they produce talkshows of the same kind that you see on the commercial broadcasters , except that they have an easy time to compete due to tax euros . 
  they broadcast the same low quality `` a cat was rescued by the fire brigade '' news as the commercial broadcasters . 
  only a tiny fraction of the time do they manage to produce a documentary . 
  here we 're running into another massive issue in this discussion : we 're associating completely different things with `` public broadcasting '' because we have no clue about each others daily life . 
  what i associate with it is [ deutsche welle ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 ) for news , it 's [ ard ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ard.de%2fhome%2fard%2fard_startseite%2f21920%2findex.html ) & [ zdf ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.zdf.de%2f ) for news , documentaries and extremely shitty tv shows for old people that i 'd rather not see funded . 
  the trick however is : these shows help finance the other content , just like in regular media . 
  what i also associate with it is [ arte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arte ) ( culture & art focused french/german co-operation ) , [ phoenix ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoenix_ ( german_tv_station \\ ) ) ( science , discussion and in-depth informational content ) and [ 3sat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3sat ) which ( at least to me ) is similar to phoenix but more suited to , well , old people . 
  overall , even for the programs that i do n't watch , i find it very , very hard to argue that they 're not overall beneficial , educational , informational and an extremely important counter-point to private media channels . 
  how exactly does thinking help you find information on [ these topics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:bbc_television_documentaries ) ? 
  why though ? 
  we 're already seeing major games via ard & zdf , the only difference on an eu level would be that you 'd be able to select the audio between various commentaries . 
  or am i missing something ? 
   which works for black-and-white issues , but what about the grey areas ? 
  that 's where it 's fine if it gets messy , as long as certain basics are respected . 
  that 's where laws and guidelines come into play that for the most part we already have in place , they just rarely are kept up to date with the advent of the internet . 
  if those things are done with the same due diligence as the average bbc documentary - why not ? 
  even in grey areas those have a proven track record . 
  ________  it 's not necessary the codex itself ( although there is plenty in there which could be used to silence the press ) , it 's the fact that you want it to apply internationally . 
  hey , i 'm entitled to some inclusive nationalism , too !, 
  the fact is that i think it 's one of the best examples i know in recent human history that sets guidelines which allow for a flexible , diverse and high quality press culture that holds itself to a certain ethical standard . 
  that 's how it needs to be seen : as a good example and starting point . 
  on a basic level the idea is that if the media agrees on rules according to which it should be judged then every single media outlet has pressure on all the others . 
  the public has pressure on all the media outlets . 
  it 's also set of * standards * not * laws * which can be used to silence the press . 
  there are some basic premises that i would n't mind being set as law but i do n't actually think we need that in extension to what already exists . 
  _______ to sum it up that kind of overreaching agreement past all partisan lines is what i consider to be desperately missing in the us over the last decade . 
  it 's basic shit like this :  unconfirmed reports , rumours or assumptions must be quoted as such . 
   symbolic photos must be clearly marked as such . 
   published news or assertions , in particular those of a personal nature , which subsequently turn out to be incorrect must be promptly rectified in an appropriate manner by the publication concerned . 
  these things give you and me a framework within which we can trust our media outlets on a fundamental level . 
  without rules there can be no trust . 
   problem with politicians but especially the ones in brussels is they have no idea how an average simple people in europe live . 
  give me more examples of their decisions that directly impacted polish people negatively !, 
  :3 what negative consequences does the eu have for you as an individual polish citizen in your every day life ? 
   let 's take refugees for example . 
  it 's not the elitist left who have to live with them and pay for them . 
  they wo n't see them in their day to day life . 
  how many refugees are living in poland right now ? 
  do you see them in your day to day life ? 
  what issues do they cause there ? 
  to list an example of a politician that can be seen as one of those in brussels in this context ( schulz ) he said in an interview that ( i 'm paraphrasing via memory ) that he considers it an issue that the eu as a whole e.g. 
  subsidizes polish agriculture but then poland refused to help with the problems that came in via refugees . 
  now , admittedly he framed the refugee crisis as a european problem here which is up for debate but the gist of it is that he considers the eu as an actual * union * that needs to figure out all issues together , the good and the bad ones . 
  in general i fully agree with that last sentiment . 
  what issue do you have with it ? 
  but that 's [ the topic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tyf65/its_high_time_for_a_european_broadcasting_service/ddq4yl7/ ) of this discussion under which it was framed . 
  you 're right though in general , i just do n't think that 's on me in this case where the topic started with someone specifically talking about how to deal with right-wing populism . 
  i do n't think that propaganda is the answer to propaganda . 
  factual corrections and well sourced information is . 
  i do n't need anyone to tell me that we need more eu regulations to help out romania . 
  nevertheless it should be said that more regulations * could * have helped such a case if some outlets openly claim the opposite . 
  it 's a really fine line that needs to be walked with these things . 
  the issue is that , by definition , the more lies and propaganda are spread the more even the most factual corrections will * look * like propaganda from the other side if people refuse to double check the sources themselves . 
   you said `` to combat right-wing populism '' , i assumed you meant left-wing - if instead you mean libertarian ideas , let me know . 
  i mean factual , well-researched information . 
  there is no need to make up anything against false claims . 
  _____  now that is dangerous : you 're calling for international laws on what is allowed in the news . 
  please quote examples directly from the [ german press codex ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) that showcase how dangerous rules and regulations are . 
   you are not entitled to money that others worked for because you want to have a european broadcasting service . 
  those who want to have that are very welcome to pay for it with your own money . 
  important distinction here . 
  i 'm not saying `` i want public broadcasting because i want it '' , my argument is that `` i want it because i consider it overall a benefit to my and our society '' . 
  if it ** does n't ** benefit society in its current form it needs to be adjusted and changed until it does . 
  ________ to me the comparison to healthcare is reasonable because it 's an example of the same underlying concept : the many throw money into a pot because it 's overall beneficial to every single individual to do so . 
  analogue i consider throwing money into a pot that allows a counterpoint to any and all privately funded organisations . 
  it allows for things to be produced that are not profitable but in the overall interest of society . 
  do you believe that our society would be better without [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:bbc_television_documentaries ) kinds of contents ? 
  do you think reuters , cnn or breitbart would produce it instead ? 
  that the result would be * less * biased than that of the bbc doing it ? 
   biased news , biased talk shows , musikantenstadl and a new tatort every other day . 
  i 'm against the latter examples too . 
  that does n't mean that public broadcasting as a concept is flawed . 
  go ahead [ point out ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 ) biased and fake news on the frontpage right now for all of us to see . 
  give me ** facts ** and ** evidence ** for your claim that i 'm delusional . 
   nope . 
  you need less of them controlled by the state . 
  public broadcasting in the west is n't rt or sputnik . 
   if your left-wing ideas can not succeed without state funding , that tells you that the demos do not want them . 
  which left-wing ideas ? 
  democratic processes , facts and human rights ? 
  _______  what the `` right-wing populists '' want is for you to play on the same playing field they have to . 
  every single press outlet in germany agreed to [ play by the same rules ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) to have a common ground so the press can be held responsible for their actions . 
  do * all * outlets * always * play by these rules ? 
  no , but it creates a framework within which the public can judge them accordingly and allows for them to be publicly called out whenever they break or bend these rules . 
  `` right wing populists '' are saying `` fuck those rules , we can circumvent them via facebook and twitter '' - is that what you consider them `` just wanting to play on the same playing field '' ? 
  where in europe do you live if i may ask ? 
  do people in your country not benefit from things that ` others are forced to pay for ' like public universal healthcare ? 
  i 'm fully behind you and would not want any of what you 're suggesting either in some form of a public eu broadcasting network . 
  the reason why i can conciliate that belief with a healthy pbs on an eu scale is because what i associate with public broadcasting is [ this ] ( http://www.dw.com/ ) site for example . 
  now we 're obviously in trouble because presumably i ca n't link you german content to substantiate what i mean but i * can * link you a rough idea for our [ ard ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ard.de%2fhome%2fard%2fard_startseite%2f21920%2findex.html ) and [ zdf ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.zdf.de%2f ) via google translate . 
  and yes , that obviously includes quality german crime shows such as `` the rosenheim cops - no honey licking '' that i 'm not particularly fond of , but overall , just based on headlines ... does that look like `` eu propaganda '' channels to you ? 
  is the italian version massively different ? 
  at a [ quick glance ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rai.it%2f ) i do n't see anything obvious but your headlines are also much less pretty than ours . 
  oh , [ you again ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5rrobx/german_opinion_poll_do_you_think_is_a_partner_we/dd9s5rq/ ) . 
   what right do you have to force everyone to pay for it , even those who are firmly opposed to your globalist , regressive-leftist agenda ?
