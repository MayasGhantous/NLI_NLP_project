  because i 'm brainwashed to believe that facts matter , universal healthcare works and that companies like bbc and pbs overall do more good than breitbart or cnn . 
   wan na marxism in france ? 
  is that , summed up in one sentence , why those two groups wont align ? 
  yup !, 
  the analogue stemmed from people describing him as someone who [ does n't have many clear positions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en_marche ! ), 
  ( the french version is obv better but that 's the gist of it ) besides being pro-european but an overall `` dream '' and a `` vision '' , combined with him being more of a businessman than a politician . 
  those two are rather trump-y characteristics , with the clear difference of where they 're at on the political spectrum . 
   you want to bend people against their own will . 
  where did i suggest that ? 
  i want democracy , freedom of speech and facts to be secure against external and internal threats . 
  education and corrections of propaganda are our democratic and western tools to address these issues . 
  we do n't let a person who walks around and punches people walk around freely because partially that enables them to punch more people . 
  analogue , we ca n't just ignore people who walk around and spread lies and disinformation on a massive scale . 
  ________  do you even know the reason for the rise of right wing ? 
  in germany ? 
  yes , and they 've got many valid points on which i agree are issues that need to be addressed even though their leadership tells them people like me want their kids to be raped by brown people . 
  in poland ? 
  no , i do n't because i 'm not from poland and do n't speak polish . 
  so i have to rely on people like you and public broadcasting to educate me . 
  however , such a public service that helps me be more educated about poland while i 'm sitting in germany does n't currently exist . 
  \\* cough \\* mind helping me out instead ? 
  same question to you : why not ? 
   you have to give them more freedom , not more european governing . 
  let 's sum this up : * right-wing populists want public broadcasting media gone ( case in point : trump ) . 
  * the idea suggested here is to introduce a public broadcasting company on an european level / a cooperation among already existing pbcs . 
  * you 're telling me that we need * less * of these ideas to combat right-wing populism because that 's what they 're asking for . 
  if right wing populism wants organisations like pbs , bbc or other public broadcasting stations gone that have overall done amazing things for their respective countries and the international community as a whole then they 're very clearly ** against fundamental western values ** . 
  people who want less of bbc in favor of more breitbart ** are ** the threat to our values . 
  you think giving in to those kind of demands under the guise of `` we just want more freedom ! '', 
  will make them disappear ? 
  no , they 'll take that extra ` freedom ' and use it to demolish core values and structures of our democracies even more . 
  the final goal of right-wing populism is n't to pull countries out of the eu . 
  it 's to create pre-ww1 types of nation states that squabble with each other , can ` deal ' with minorities as they please and in the end will either be forced to rely on big blocks or go to war with each other . 
  __________ no , fuck that . 
  the solution is to splice off the portion of those movements that are there because of genuine issues , take them serious and help them address these issues in a civil and democratic way . 
  the positions of the average person that votes these parties and the position of more `` moderate '' people who do n't are n't as far apart as the leaders of either party make it out to be . 
  education is a primary tool to achieve this . 
  public broadcasting all over the globe is a symbol of a basic , solid level of education . 
  the parts that we think suck about it ? 
  let 's work on them to fix them . 
  * abandoning * them because ` that 's what they are asking for ' is a crazy idea . 
  ____ democracy should not be a tool for those who seek to demolish democracy itself . 
  look at what almost complete deregulation made possible in the us : an overtake of a democratic system because various movements were free to grow over decades . 
  why not ? 
   in spain they did n't get additional votes in the general election by combining their forces . 
  i think i misphrased that , what i meant is that if you look at [ various polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017 ) just the * combined * votes on the left would be enough to push through . 
  they would n't even need additional votes to tie with lepen and be ahead of everyone else . 
   the thing that irks me is that western governments and media did n't say a thing about this during the last years ** but i think that is because pro-eu governments were ruling ** . 
  i can totally see where you 're coming from on this one , i do think it 's coming from a different angle however . 
  a few years back there were n't people telling me that the [ munich shooter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_munich_shooting ) was muslim because cnn * literally * invented an anonymous witness to make that up . 
  there were n't people telling me that `` a muslim mob set a church on fire '' last new years when what happened there was a random , minor accident next to a church that happens hundreds and thousands of times every year in germany and especially at that date . 
  a few years ago i did n't hear that [ poland is invading belarus ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5tr0iv/us_govt_officials_inquire_about_polish_invasion/ ) and that us officials are actively investigating that claim because there 's apparently enough evidence to do so . 
  i can find these kinds of stories referred to in * german speaking * outlets that are then spread among and by the usual right-wing extremists who circulate them back into the system with no accountability whatsoever . 
  this shit is dangerous . 
  it 's painted as a threat to our values because that 's what it fundamentally is . 
  where you suggest a conspiracy to push back against the will of the people i see an immune response * because * of the will of the people . 
  am german , am european , am gladly paying for the privilege to be educated by global elitists like the bbc , pbs or ard & zdf . 
   the tone of this article higly suggest that such a type of european broadcasting service , would in fact be used as a propaganda device to spread the ` right ' type of opinions . 
  no , it does n't . 
  it emphasizes the same values that keeps content at a comparatively high quality akin to the bbc , the [ german public broadcasting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beitragsservice_von_ard,_zdf_und_deutschlandradio ) or pbs in the us ( which trump plans to defund and/or privatize btw ) . 
  we already ** have ** a ( rather loose ) union of these channels in the eu : the [ ebu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union ) - what we do n't have is them working out a program together . 
  _______ the `` right '' type of * content * is high quality , well-researched and as independent as possible . 
  when i tune into a program by bbc or pbs in the english speaking world it 's usually , on average , among the best . 
  if i tune into ard/zdf or even click the english version of [dw.com ] ( http://www.dw.com ) i might get a bit too boring or slow content for my taste , i might get a bit too much ` content for old people ' if that makes any sense . 
  but overall in the grand scheme of things i 'm also getting pretty damn high quality . 
  ______ e : also the mere idea of football games being broadcasted on an eu wide channel where i can press a button to switch to spanish commentary after they score a goal gives me a massive errection . 
  if hamon and m\u00e9lenchon would find a way to band together they 'd already be ahead of lepen . 
  the french left is * strong * , but it 's also divided . 
  from what i 've been told by french friends hamons plans to deal with issues such as this seem much smarter than what i 've heard from e.g. 
  macron who i 've heard described as `` literally trump , just more moderate and with a left cloak '' . 
  if i understand it correctly the french left sees him as a businessman without much content and that 's where that comparison is coming from . 
   there is no dialogue to be had . 
  the lines are drawn already . 
  you 're not talking people into switching sides . 
  are you saying that the us you know personally around you is ** literally ** / r/the _ donald vs the other side ? 
  ; ; _______  i would n't even know where to go . 
  canada/mexico -  eu/australia/uk / sa . 
  look , i 'm by no means suggesting that things go * that * bad in the us that it 's 100 % anyone has to flee anywhere . 
  what i ** can ** tell you however is that i know more than one person alive today because their parents and grandparents left germany when the majority still said they 're crazy to do that kind of thing . 
  `` it would never go that bad '' , `` they 'd never actually * hurt * us '' or `` our neighbors are different '' played a part in millions of people dying . 
  now , the us by no means is nazi germany . 
  trump or bannon are n't hitler . 
  we 're not living in the 20th century where flow of information can be controlled , but it can be diluted , warped and the trust of people in information can be eroded . 
  but despite all of this we 're seeing signs that germany showed in november 1932 . 
  it does n't hurt to learn from history and have some basic preparation ( food , medicine , hard cash , travel routes , social connections ) in place . 
  not that much effort for potentially massive gain . 
   is it three quarters on or three quarters to ? 
  hahaha . 
  yeah , that 's it in a nutshell . 
  the funniest part is that [ on a map ] ( http://www.norddeutschelernendieuhrzulesen.de/geo/ ) there is no clear geographical divider that makes sense in the german context . 
  every yellow dot is someone reporting that `` three quarters seven '' is the right one for 18:45 and every black dot is someone reporting `` one quarter before seven '' as what 's normal for their area . 
  the name of that site is also literally `` north germans learn how to say what time it is '' because when the author started the site in 2006 he made it to prove that , him being from southern germany , the people up north are doing it wrong . 
  that also did n't go too well . 
  18:15 is even worse cause the two variants would be `` quarter past six '' and `` quarter seven '' . 
  for 18:30 suddenly everyone agrees and it 's `` half seven '' . 
   is still taken hostage by the coal industry hey , we germans made sure to set an example there too !, 
  the one advantage regular people like you and me have right now is that the more chaotic a system becomes the more can very minor contributions escalate . 
  from talking to friends , family or strangers on the internet , establishing dialogue is n't a bad idea . 
   i 've decided that all i can do is cross my fingers and try not to get hurt . 
  i usually do n't say this this directly to people i do n't know but if there is anything about you that establishes you as a well defined minority that plan should involve an idea to actually change locations if shit hits the fan and the intent to act on those plans before it 's too late .
