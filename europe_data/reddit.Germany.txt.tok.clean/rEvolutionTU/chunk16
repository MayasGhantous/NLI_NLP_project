  if history tells us anything then the window between `` okay , this is absolutely 100 % guaranteed fucked '' and `` now it 's so fucked that i ca n't get out even if i wanted to '' is pretty damn thin . 
   could you imagine a wehrmacht with thousands of nuclear weapons ? 
  yup . 
  not to mention it being friendly with the only other nation hat has a similar arsenal . 
  at least this time poland would get annexed and not split up eh . 
  do you have an idea as to how to get out of that mess with the least amount of overall `` damage '' ? 
  the poster you 're answering to also said * least intuitive * not * least correct * . 
  =p same over here by the way . 
  februar 2017 '' is what you 'd say in german , hence 13.2.2017 makes sense . 
  2017.02.13 is something i honestly have never seen used except for when i 'm trying to name dates for file structures , hence the 0 becomes important to me there . 
  do you speak any other languages fluently ? 
  for me times and dates are some of the things that are ** really ** hard to not think about in english even though i 'm otherwise super confident . 
  for times i can usually fall back on military to solve most issues but for dates ... not so much . 
  not to mention most ( all ? ), 
  people here learned be and not ae in school so that 's another point that gets confusing fast . 
  most people * learn * be ( and speak to other people who learned be in europe ) but then all this ae jumps at you in other places online . 
  but then germans also found funny ways to confuse people from nearby regions with the way they 're saying what time it is so there there 's that . 
  ______ also , hey , at least we can refer to the american election as ** our ** 9/11 and it makes perfect sense !, 
  i 've been pretty damn depressed about what is happening in the us since years and especially months now , but you just managed to make it sound even worse . 
  what makes you convinced the us is in * that * bad kind of shape ? 
  the way i saw things since ages now was that it * should * only be a matter of time till the us as a whole realizes it 's not the beacon of freedom , democracy and `` fuck yeah '' that most people seem to still imagine it to be . 
  but then i also got ta admit that it just seems to keep getting worse . 
   and that would involve not giving them hegemony anymore . 
  and we really could use your help in doing so . 
  please tell your actual egalitarian governments to kick out the us military already . 
  i ca n't speak for other germans obviously but for me personally i believe we need to walk an * extremely * thin line in the next couple of years , especially depending on the french election outcome . 
  turns out we 're prolly more stable than our favorite love-hate neighbors . 
  i 've went from `` can we kick those us nukes and troops out please ? '', 
  to `` so . . what about a joint eu nuclear program and a standing army ... ? '', 
  within the last half year or so , mostly because i never fully understood how fragile some values and ideas i 've been taking for granted since 25 + years actually are . 
  right now , at this point of time , if ensuring that russia keeps its head down and away from our bros in the east means sucking up to some american dicks , i 'm all for that . 
  meanwhile i 'll still protest the war in iran when it happens , i 'll still be for an eu army and a joint nuclear program . 
  if europe as a whole does n't understand that without unity there wo n't be lasting peace on this continent and that without a well-organized military force in most aspects we 'll always be american or russian pawns , then we and our kids are fucked anyway . 
  until that point however i got ta say that kicking out the us is secondary to ensuring unity in the eu . 
  but then that obviously begs the question * how * committed this current us administration is to safe guardian the baltics or poland in the first place . 
  been a while since i 've been actually glad that i 'm not someone who has to actively find concrete solutions for these issues . 
   we do n't work like europe . 
  our whole country becoming wealthier does n't lead to better outcomes for us like it does for you . 
  we 're a fucked up nation that worships rich people and spits on the poor . 
  that 's kind of what i was trying to bait out and i 'm sorry that you 're eating up downvotes for what i think is a pretty reasonable point in general . 
  see , to me it 's like healthcare . 
  dozens of countries established systems that costs less per person than the system in the us , yet the us lacks the universal coverage these nations are able to provide for their citizens . 
  the issue here can never be that ** healthcare ** is bad and does n't work , the issue is that ** healthcare like it 's done in the us does n't work as well as other models ** . 
  analogue nato in itself is amazing because it secures peace and prosperity for its members and the projection the us gets out of it makes the us a richer and more prosperous country . 
  it 's benefiting * more * from it than any other individual member . 
  _______ the issue is n't that you perceive that you 're not getting anything out of nato personally , the issue is that the benefits the us gets out of nato are n't passed on to you as much as you 'd like to be able to appreciate it . 
  do n't blame universal healthcare as a bad concept , blame the american ideas about it that prevent it working properly . 
  do n't blame nato for not helping you personally prosper , blame the american system for not letting you benefit off it . 
  _______ to me that 's the angle this type of issue needs to be framed in because otherwise it 's right next to people who want nato and other alliances gone because they genuinely believe the us economy as a whole does n't profit off it . 
  in the end , that 's the only way to change the system longterm instead of making it worse again and again just to have another scapegoat that 's getting blamed . 
   only i 'm paying much more for it . 
  how much do you personally pay for nato ? 
  and no , % of gdp does n't tell the full story here . 
  did you know that for example germany spends 11 % of it 's total federal budget on the military while the us spends 16 % ? 
  total . 
  russia spends 20 % . 
  __________  what am i , as an american , getting out of this that a european is not ? 
  that if i go into a supermarket in berlin , paris , london or madrid i 'll find mcdonalds , coca cola and pepsi . 
  while you most likely have never heard about [ afri-cola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afri-cola ) or [ fritz cola ] ( http://www.lovemarks.com/wp-content/uploads/lovemark-fritz-kola-standard-600x600.jpg ) and neither has the vast majority of other posters here . 
  the us ** wants ** to project military and cultural power across the globe , other western nations do n't or want to a much lesser extent . 
  that projection of power brings you guys jobs , prestige and in the end money . 
  if ** you ** do n't want the us to spend money on that , that 's totally reasonable . 
  but in that case you need to push for people being elected who want a smaller military budget and less projection of power across the globe . 
   our average work-a-day taxpayers like me do n't . 
  [ this ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/usa/show/all/2014/ ) shows where the us imported from and [ this ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/usa/show/all/2014/ ) shows where the us exported to in 2014 . 
  feel free to play around with the datasets , it 's overall pretty amazing . 
  your personal prosperity and quality of life is * directly * related to every single nation your nation is trading with being stable . 
  you not having war and poverty in your country is directly related to me not having war in my country even though we 're 4000 + miles apart . 
  __________ nato and the eu are directly related to the last 70 + years of peace across the `` western world '' . 
  without those types of things countries would fall back into pre-ww1 conditions of nationalistic states competing with each other . 
  just this time with a few nations having access to nuclear weapons on top of it . 
  that 's the alternative . 
  so yes , if you and me and everyone we have ever known or loved being alive and living pretty damn amazing compared to the world average is something you consider as something positive then yes , ** you ** personally are getting something out of it . 
  just to add some context : * for years belarus vs russia headlines made it into western news outlets painting the former buddies as not liking each other too much . 
  * since the 12th of february the new [ visa-policy ] ( http://belarusdigest.com/story/visa-free-travel-and-registration-belarus-not-so-simple-28619 ) ( is this a reliable source ? 
  i doubt it but you get the gist of it ) that `` outraged russia '' is in place . 
  it also lead to thousands of tourists flooding the country if that article is to be believed . 
  * this was cited as the main reason for the [ russians ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/wirestory/russia-establishes-controls-border-belarus-45198753 ) to build up their side of the border . 
  * this in return was the reason for [ belarus ] ( http://observer.com/2017/02/belarus-national-security-nato-vladimir-putin/ ) to make a massive military exercise * including * calling up reservists . 
  _________ up to this point everything looks like a situation with a high likelihood of conflict between russia and belarus . 
  what concerns me ( and seemingly / u/asshair too ) is that this classic piece of russian disinformation aka `` btw poland is invading belarus '' is now almost instantly picked up by american officials as credible enough to look into it . 
  * a ) nothing to worry about , random russian propaganda that will lead to nothing . 
  * b ) russian propaganda aimed at threatening belarus to comply and/or shuffle troops around . 
  * c ) russian propaganda aimed to create a reason for ~ ~ russian troops ~ ~ belarussian troops that found a few new members and tanks to move to guard the polish-belarussian border . 
  if a ) who cares . 
  if b ) we 're looking at ukraine 2.0 or anschluss 2.0 , if c ) peace is [ threatened again ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) by these pesky polish flags that everyone seems to keep around for these occasions . 
  those are the exact same letters i just linked you . 
  that 's the important quote . 
  ** the entire stanza with emphasis on the third one ** was the result of those letters . 
  april 1952 und den 2 . 
  mai 1952 , am 6 . 
  ** ________ that 's also why we have letters from 1991 that * specifically * point the third stanza as the official one out from that point onwards :  \u201e die 3 . 
   rubbish . 
  the 3rd verse of `` lied der deutschen '' is the national anthem since 1952 . 
  the official national anthem between ww2 and 1990 included ** the entire text all three stanzas ** . 
  only the third stanza was used for anything official since 1954 which is why people say that * unofficially * only the third one was part of the german anthem . 
  it was n't until 1990 that officially only the third verse was accepted . 
  you can quite simply open up [ wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_nationalhymne ) and check for yourself . 
  ____ [ here ] ( http://www.1000dokumente.de/pdf/dok_0255_hym_de.pdf ) are the official letters confirming the above . 
   the the first verse of our national anthem \\* the first verse of our national anthem from 25 years ago .
