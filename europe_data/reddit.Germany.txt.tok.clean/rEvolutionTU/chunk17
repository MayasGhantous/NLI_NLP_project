   possibly how the germans feel when watching the ` hitler reacts to ' - videos . 
  dude , they 're so much more amazing when you know german . 
   denmark : lego is for lazy people . 
  i propose : denmark : kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 . 
  e : also i should learn to scroll down first . . 
   chechnya speaking of which , just in case you missed it [ this ] ( https://www.zdf.de/dokumentation/zdfzoom/zdfzoom-putins-kalter-krieg-100.html ) german speaking documentary by probably [ one of the best ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/egmont_r._koch ) we have around portrays rather believable that a large percentage of `` chechnyan refugees '' are plain and simple russian sleeper agents . 
  it also includes a few rather famous people straight up admitting that they may have bent the truth a bit to gain refugee status in germany and are regular visitors in the country they had to `` flee '' from because they 're buddies with the regime there . 
  what the afd does `` well '' at the moment is they 're trying to appeal both to the extreme right and the moderate right if that makes sense . 
  they 're trying to play this whole game where extremists make a comment that could be straight from an actual neo-nazi and then the party leadership is `` distancing '' itself from such a comment without kicking said person out . 
  the extreme people find that appealing because `` see , they were only forced to correct themselves ! '', 
  and the people who are a bit less extreme are like `` see , they 're not actual nazis ! '', 
  would not be surprised in the slightest if we 'll hear about some of their members facing actual prosecution in the near future . 
  at least german press is rather relentless when this shit happens . 
  _______  the typical homophobic/pro-life/anti-feminist values usually associated with the populist right the afd is pretty [ flexible ] ( https://www.blogrebellen.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/afd-adventskalender-16-670x612.jpg ) on some of those issues . 
  what this glorious meme describes is that they wanted adultery to be considered during divorces because family values and all that . 
  then the leading missus wanted a divorce so that point got removed from the party program . 
  for the other and similar points they 're pulling all the classics including climate change denial , kids being able to land in jail when they 're 12 , ditching the euro , tax reductions for the rich , removal of some insurances , the whole kitchen sink program . 
  pretty sure that compared to the other `` big right wing names '' they 're one of the furthest out there . 
  someone else linked this here earlier , same shit : http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ - never heard about that summary before either . 
  wondering if i should work on a nice summary and send them to some of the official eu pr people . 
  maybe combined with a survey in a place like this sub . 
  hmmm ... . that actually might not be the worst idea . 
  e : fuck it , i 'll think of something . 
  i like that idea . 
   yeah , but releasing a pdf somewhere does literally nothing to stop the millions of people who see the headlines from believing them . 
  man , even though the work those guys do seems to be done properly most of the time their understanding of social media and their presence there is completely and utterly atrocious . 
  when i first found their site it took me minutes to figure out they 're * actually * an official eu thing ( even now you need to google and look really well to find the link from the eeas eu site to them ) and that they exist since more than a year . 
  between november 2015 and today they went from 3k twitter followers to 13k . 
  [ some of their videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvtl8qlzzy ) have like 5k views top end and look like what people in their 60s think the youth of today would totally watch . 
  would n't be surprised if they 're getting more exposure from one reddit thread like this than they got in months before that . 
  rightfully so . 
  the current plans by e.g. 
  correctiv to check facebook articles and add a clarification to the article ( without deleting it ) will only be effective ** after ** those articles have been shared thousands of times and people already moved on . 
  i genuinely doubt that kind of approach is effective enough but i also do n't have much better ideas besides pointing bullshit out with proper sources wherever we notice it ourselves . 
  do you have any good ideas ? 
  hey , that 's why at the start i asked you what you had an issue with !, 
  if this initial assessment of theirs is incorrect ( aka what they linked to said something else ) then that 's a whole different can of worms :  ukraine is poised to enact a new language law which will ban russian and make ukrainian the sole and exclusive language in the country . 
  ... either way at that point i 'm out of my league because i could n't verify the original russian source . 
  ______________  since eu task force was disapproving the russian news , i would like to see where did they actually did that . 
  and if they did n't then they produced fake news . 
  logically it 's proven or not , there is no middle ground . 
  they said the above statement is provably false . 
  if it indeed is false , how are * they * spreading fake news by saying so ? 
  ____________  french is known for their aggressive support of their language , but even then i could find english only channel in my hotel room . 
  i 'm by no means disputing that those policies do seem pretty harsh , harsher than most eu countries for sure . 
  what i ** am ** arguing against is that you 're using those policies to throw [ an official eu organisation ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/2116/%20questions%20and%20answers%20about%20the%20east%20stratcom%20task%20force ) in the same category as breitbart or infowars . 
  hell , i 'm pretty sure that if you have a genuine issue with a report you can just throw an email at the official press relation offices and get a proper answer and/or correction . 
  that 's how it works with any other official agency or traditional media outlet that works like they 're supposed to . 
  their purpose is n't to be infallible , but to do their work with the proper level of attention and care . 
  to correct fuckups when they happen . 
  good luck trying that with the things people rightfully label `` fake news '' . 
  here they 're saying that since they 're publishing #\u00d6zg\u00dcr\u00dcz together with can d\u00fcndar they 're under attack by turkish extremists . 
  the newspaper sabah published a photograph in which he ( author of that piece ) was circled in red with the claim that he 's an agent who supports terrorism . 
  [ picture ] ( https://correctiv.org/media/thumbnails/filer_public_thumbnails/37/e6/37e69a1b-f5c2-49f7-b01a-b5f98f757ad0/bildschirmfoto_2017-01-29_um_135912.png__1140x0_q85_subject_location-343%2c313_subsampling-2.png ) in question . 
  _________ if i 'm reading [ his wikipage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/can_d%c3%bcndar ) correctly can d\u00fcndar was the target of an assassination attempt and is now living in exile in germany ? 
  is that what you meant by `` mixed up '' ? 
  =p what 's the story behind hayko ba\u011fdat ? 
   got a link to ** the ** law ? 
  ha , you 're funny . 
  =p [ vwvfg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwvfg/__23.html ) for all general administrations , [ gvg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gvg/__184.html ) for all courts ( exception here for sorbs ) , [ ao ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ao_1977/__87.html ) for all financial matters , [ sgb ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_10/__19.html ) for all social issues , and [ patent law ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/patg/__35a.html ) ( which gives some leeway on translations within a 3-12 months timeframe depending on the language ) . 
  and all that is just the most obvious and official stuff . 
  only since 2011 we 're allowing people to take drivers license tests in 11 other languages for example . 
  all of the above has some regional exceptions depending on the state . 
  ________ * tertiary education must be in ukrainian , except few subjects in english or eu languages . 
  that includes state or private colleges . 
  that 's again restriction on speech , if a professor , in a private college , wants to give math in japanese and he has plenty of students then he should be able to . 
  even if i do n't think that 's ** law ** here ( i 'm not entirely sure ) that 's the standard over here . 
  exceptions are usually because of specific subjects , e.g. 
  japanese in a japanese course . 
  ** if ** you have a foreign prof who ca n't speak german or english there will be a translator around , at least i 've never heard of any other case . 
  * all ** internal ** documents of civic organizations , political parties must be in ukrainian - no exceptions . 
  while i do n't * think * we have such a restriction here we do have regulations that * some * internal documents ( mostly those that may eventually be seen by the public aka anything official ) have to be in german ( again there 's an exception for sorbs ) . 
  * all advertisement must be in ukrainian , oral or not . 
  against it 's restriction on speech . 
  no exception . 
  article 28 . 
  * all movies made in ukrainian must be in ukrainian , a foreign language allowed only for 15 % with ukrainian subtitles . 
  these two remind me massively of the french [ toubon law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toubon_law ) which includes e.g. 
  minimum quotas for french songs for radio channels . 
  ___________ all of what i 'm describing above is considered in line with at least some eu countries and is not considered to be against eu laws or regulations . 
  __________ * ukrainians must name their children using names abiding with ukrainian language , he want to use a french name nicola - they ca n't - must use mikola . 
  that 's the only one i have n't heard about from any eu country . 
  _____________ _____________ super important for this entire discussion : not a single one of these points goes against this statement : `` every person is guaranteed the right to choose the language ** he or she wishes to speak ** and no restrictions have ever been enacted limiting that choice '' . 
  yes , now we 're in nitpicky legal territory but none of those are restrictions that prevent you from speaking russian or english or any other language . 
  that 's what that statement says , not more , not less . 
  the way i see it is this : * the initial claim ( russian being banned and ukrainian being made the exclusive language ) is still false . 
  * russian being banned in the future or present is also still untrue and hence a `` disinformation '' . 
  * there also is `` no restriction on the right to choose the language he or she wishes to ** speak ** '' ( in general ) . 
  ___________ so all of the claims made are still , even if we take in what you 're saying here , absolutely true . 
  now , the art . 
  14 you 're describing says there ** is ** a restriction on which language to use when crossing a border . 
  i do n't see how that directly contradicts any of the above statements . 
  at least from my point of view it can totally be in line with each other that there is no restriction on the language people are allowed to speak in general but also that you have to speak a specific language at a border crossing . 
  for example what comes to mind is that in germany people are completely free to speak in whatever language they choose to but at the same time no single german civil servant is allowed to give you advice that is in any language but german . 
  __________ from that angle maybe , maybe i can see an argument that the report omits that yes , there are very specific restrictions at border controls but i would never go as far as using that as an argument that they 're spreading `` fake news '' or stuff that is simply untrue . 
  does that make sense to you ? 
  mind replying over [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srzbm/german_intelligence_finds_no_evidence_of_putin/ddi2veo/ ) since we 're currently super deep in a deleted chain and no one will ever find these comments otherwise ? 
  :3 super messy but that might be the better choice for you to get your point across since it 's all orderly there now . 
  e : all good , let 's stick to that chain . 
  jesus christ what a mess lol .
