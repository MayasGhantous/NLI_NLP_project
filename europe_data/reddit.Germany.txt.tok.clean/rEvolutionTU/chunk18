  since this is the main thread we had and the post just got approved i 'll drag the discussion over here if that 's alright with you . 
  [ this ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_02.02.2017_eng.pdf ) was the . pdf you referred to , more specifically [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/mxfux ) entry for 22.01.2017 . 
  ________ the summary of the disinformation is this :  ukraine is poised to enact a new language law which will ban russian and make ukrainian the sole and exclusive language in the country . 
  the reply ( i 'm removing the shorteners so we do n't need more mods here ) :  it is an often repeated disinformation that russian is or will be banned in ukraine . 
  according to ukraine 's constitution and the law on languages , every person is guaranteed the right to choose the language he or she wishes to speak and no restrictions have ever been enacted limiting that choice ( see article 10 ) . 
  the draft law under consideration in the ukrainian parliament allows the use of languages other than ukrainian in government business but requires translation into ukrainian . 
  what specifically in that reply is what you initially referred to as the eu taskforce spreading fake news ? 
  alright . 
  now that we got that sorted out , we 're on the same page . 
  which parts of the reply did you initially consider as the task force spreading `` fake news '' ? 
  is it only this part or more :  and no restrictions have ever been enacted limiting that choice, 
  ohmy . 
  i 'm genuinely sorry that i missed that this entire time , but it would also have been easier if you would have just linked it . 
  =p am i understanding you correctly that you agree with everything that is said there ** except ** this portion :  and no restrictions have ever been enacted limiting that choice, 
  [ this ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_26.01.2017_eng.pdf ) is the current , official , . pdf file that * should * have that date in it . 
  it does n't however . 
  now , i 'm * assuming * you 're aware of that since you 're so resistant to linking the source . 
  i 'm also assuming you downloaded that . pdf a few days ago and did n't invent it . 
  did you consider that instead of the eu taskforce `` spreading fake news '' they were told that part was bullshit , they acted properly and hence it was removed from all future versions of this . pdf ? 
  my other post got eaten by automod due to the link shorteners they use , so i 'll just repeat here until it gets approved :  stopfake is wrong and so eu taskforce . 
  please link where the eu taskforce made the quote you 're claiming they made .

  summary :  representatives of kyiv city council advocate the exclusive use of the ukrainian state language on the territory of the city and propose to ban russian completely disproof :  this fake story uses a draft proposal by kyiv city council member yuriy syrotiuk registered on march 11 . 
  syrotiuk proposes to establish that ukrainian be used in city advertising , record keeping and official communication with the residents of the city . 
  there is absolutely no mention of prohibiting russian in any public or private sphere . 
  paragraph 3 of the draft decision clearly states that `` use of other languages is possible on request '' . 
  according to ukraine 's constitution and the law on languages , every person is guaranteed the right to choose the language he or she wishes to speak and no restrictions have ever been enacted limiting that choice ( http://bit.ly/1rxcheh ) . 
  ... also does n't align with what you initially quoted or suggested . 
  mind linking the article you 're accusing of being `` fake news '' and sources that state it 's wrong ? 
  e : for people confused by the chaos below , we just spent a [ way too long ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srzbm/german_intelligence_finds_no_evidence_of_putin/ddi19pg/ ) comment chain to figure out both of our posts were being eaten by automod and in the current [ primary chain ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srzbm/german_intelligence_finds_no_evidence_of_putin/ddi2veo/ ) further down we 're all nice and civil and figured out our sources . 
  if you 're curious the [ eu taskforce ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/commentary-means-goals-and-consequences-of-the-pro-kremlin-disinformation-campaign/ ) on this topic goes into more detail and also regularly releases pdfs such as [ this ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_02.02.2017_eng.pdf ) that point out specific stories and where they 're originating from . 
  [ here ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/eu-bans-baptising-children/ ) for example was the `` the eu bans baptizing children '' headline being circulated by a bulgarian outlet as something they pointed out . 
  people from [ macedonia ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/the-surge-of-pro-trump-fake-news-is-coming-from-macedonia/8003094 ) made loads of money with `` fake news '' in the american election . 
  ______ we also know that the german non-profit outlet [ correctiv ] ( https://correctiv.org/en/ ) ( those are the guys who will be tasked with fact-checking facebook posts in the future and who have released [ amazing articles ] ( https://correctiv.org/en/investigations/system-putin/article/2015/07/30/putins-early-years/ ) on e.g.

  russia today ) and turkish ( e.g. 
  also , since their model is based on being transparent with donators , multiple donators have received threats or their donations are being used to accuse correctiv of biases . 
  because of all this they 're currently under federal police protection . 
  if you 're curious the [ eu taskforce ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/commentary-means-goals-and-consequences-of-the-pro-kremlin-disinformation-campaign/ ) on this topic goes into more detail and also regularly releases pdfs such as [ this ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_02.02.2017_eng.pdf ) that point out specific stories and where they 're originating from . 
  [ here ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/eu-bans-baptising-children/ ) for example was the `` the eu bans baptizing children '' headline being circulated by a bulgarian outlet . 
  ___________ in a nutshell , there is very clear evidence that russian state media and eastern european outlets are spreading straight up false and misleading stories . 
  we also know that people from [ macedonia ] ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.leeokk9pb#.idqxqq5gr ) made loads of money with `` fake news '' in the american election . 
  what we ** do n't ** know is whether that 's a coordinated effort that is government sponsored , whether people are doing it for monetary gains , outlets are incompetent or what exactly is going on . 
  but we ** do ** know it exists and which directions it supports . 
   we were discussing the article with the statements from german intelligence ...  ** despite not being able to find any direct evidence , the german spies seemed convinced that the russian government is coordinating a campaign to `` sow disunity in the eu and germany , and so to weaken their position of power '' from the highest levels of the russian government ** : `` the bundling of all the influencing activities in the presidential administration does represent a significant success factor . '', 
  the [ original source ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienste-bnd-keine-beweise-fuer-desinformations-kampagne-putins-1.3365839 ) in german is even more clear . 
  the reporting by sputnik or rt is called `` hostile '' , and it 's clearly stated that this release does not absolve russia from anything which is why investigations are n't being stopped or considered conclusive . 
  in a nutshell , your interpretation of the article is still massively wrong and misleading . 
  _________________ i 'll say it one last time : ** the report also states that there is clear evidence for some kind of pro-russian/anti-eu disinformation campaign . 
  ** - all it points out that suits your interpretation is that so far none of that was directly connected to the russian government . 
  ... you do n't consider a single of the examples in the pdf or euvsdisinfo report as * evidence * for an ongoing disinformation campaign ? 
  then i ca n't help you since you 're obviously intent on disagreeing what evidence is . 
   what positive evidence ? 
  straight from the article :  despite not being able to find any direct evidence , the german spies seemed convinced that the russian government is coordinating a campaign to `` sow disunity in the eu and germany , and so to weaken their position of power '' from the highest levels of the russian government : `` the bundling of all the influencing activities in the presidential administration does represent a significant success factor . '', 
  or [ straight from the eu taskforce on this topic ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/commentary-means-goals-and-consequences-of-the-pro-kremlin-disinformation-campaign/ ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/disinformation_review_02.02.2017_eng.pdf ) pdf also lists a few known recent examples . 
  i get where you 're coming from but i still got ta add that that sub is overall really , really well maintained by everyone involved . 
  if you 're ever curious , that 's the place to check . 
  in a nutshell i 'd say the overall current sentiment is that while yes , assad sucks major dickballs and while yes , removing him early would have been a decent option ( assuming the post-war time would n't have been fucked up as massively as in iraq ) ... at this point in time he 's the lesser of multiple evils . 
  it 's still a really shitty situation overall . 
  there 's no winners in this conflict . 
   there is no evidence that russian government is involved . 
  right ? 
  so any statements about russian government 's involvement are not based on evidence . 
  right ? 
  correct . 
  ** that does in no way shape or form mean that there is n't an ongoing pro-russian/anti-eu disinformation campaign . 
  ** ______________ and no , that does not answer the question i asked you . 
  for statement 1 ) the basis is the absence of evidence . 
  for statement 2 ) we have positive evidence . 
  ** both are with our current knowledge true statements . 
  ** the massive difference is that the first position can still change , while the second position is already established . 
   yes , i consider conjectures about something being likely , or not likely to be of less import then facts about the evidence of such meddling . 
  why do you consider ** evidence ** we have of russian meddling to be `` conjecture '' but ** not finding evidence ** about the russian government being involved directly `` facts '' ? 
  facts are this : * 1 ) the german intelligence agency found no evidence of the russian government being involved in the ongoing disinformation campaigns . 
  * 2 ) there ** is ** a disinformation campaign ongoing , the vast majority of which is pro-kremlin/pro-russian/anti-european sentiment . 
   russia 's meddling  but look , this particular article does n't fit the narrative * 1 ) you 're suggesting / r/europe loves articles about russian meddling in general ( prolly true ) * 2 ) you 're claiming this particular article does n't fit the `` narrative '' . 
  the ` narrative ' is that russia is involved ( aka `` meddiling '' ) in the current disinformation campaign for which we ** do ** have plenty of evidence , some of which i and others linked in this thread . 
  * 3 ) the article ** very specifically ** says `` no evidence of russias government being involved '' but also `` evidence of russian influence in general still most likely a thing '' aka it supports the ` narrative ' you just attacked in the first place . 
  _________ i 'm struggling to explain this any better to you but i 'll try if you have any further specific questions . 
  odds are when multiple people `` misinterpret '' a message you sent out then maybe what you sent out was n't as clear as you thought it was in the first place . 
   seriously ? 
  i think it 's quite common to reference govenrment of a state just by naming that state . 
  i * think * ( maybe because you sounded like you 're like lol agency says russia is n't involved and ya 'll downvote it in [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srzbm/german_intelligence_finds_no_evidence_of_putin/ddhdgff/ ) entire chain ) most people misunderstood you then . 
  that 's also why multiple people spoke up to point out that the two things are entirely different . 
  from context the [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srzbm/german_intelligence_finds_no_evidence_of_putin/ddhetsj/ ) that started this current chain ( by you arguing against the point below ) suggests something else :  but you are trying to present it as a clear `` no '' answer to any accusations of russia conducting misinformation attack , which is obviously wrong and in no way can be concluded from this article - actually it says the opposite and gives clear examples of misinformation attacks conducted by russia in germany . 
  `` they have no evidence of the involvement of russian government '' and `` they have no evidence of russian involvement '' are two completely different statements that you seem to consider one and the same . 
   they said themselves that they have no evidence . 
  that is incorrect . 
  there was no evidence that directly implicates the russian government . 
  [ other ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/commentary-means-goals-and-consequences-of-the-pro-kremlin-disinformation-campaign/ ) eu groups come to similar conclusions .
