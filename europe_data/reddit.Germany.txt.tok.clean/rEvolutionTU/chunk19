  what we ** do ** have is evidence for ** some ** form of disinformation campaign , it 's just that there is no direct link to the russian government . 
  i downvoted as well and provided an explanation [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srzbm/german_intelligence_finds_no_evidence_of_putin/ddhkcdv/ ) . 
  tldr : the title is extremely misleading . 
  the german intelligence agencies did ** not ** say `` there is no evidence for any russian involvement let 's go home '' . 
  on top of that the title is misleading . 
  `` finds no evidence of putin disinformation campaign '' while the third sentence is `` but the leaked government report ** suggests that indirect methods may be at work . 
  ** '' the latter is perfectly in line with what the [ eeas taskforce ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/commentary-means-goals-and-consequences-of-the-pro-kremlin-disinformation-campaign/ ) for this topic has to say on it . 
  so yes , there is no evidence of an organized official campaign authorized by the russian government . 
  but also yes , there ** is ** evidence for * some * involvement . 
  that 's why the article you linked says `` we did n't find * concrete * evidence but we 're not giving it some form of ` all-clear nothing to see here ' either '' . 
  you 're a better man than me . 
  when i see things that heavily go against what i consider a rational approach i usually end up checking history , especially if i 'm not involved in the discussion myself . 
  if that 's also not the most glorious place i end up tagging people so i can at least recognize the account in the future . 
  sometimes stuff turns out to be an outlier , most of the time it does n't . 
  check his post history . 
  maybe that puts it into perspective . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  but then that 's where we need to start . 
  saying `` i want to change the geneva conventions on refugees because they do n't fit the current situation '' is totally fine in my book . 
  that frames the discussion positively and constructively since the next question will be : `` what do you think we should change ? '', 
  what i 'm seeing instead however is `` i want a blanket ban on muslim immigrants too !, 
  '' , which would both be against conventions we agreed on or even against for example the german constitution . 
  so as it stands that 's , by all definitions our countries have for this , just an illegal and hence rather idiotic proposal . 
  the issue is that instead of being intellectually honest about this people hide behind `` i 'm not right-wing i just want a blanket ban on muslim immigration ! '', 
  instead of `` i want the geneva convention on refugees/the constitution of country x changed '' because that would require putting yourself into the basket of other groups who have these positions . 
  ______________ if we decide to change our fundamental values over this kind of issue , sure , that 's a discussion i do n't mind having . 
  maybe that 's the proper response . 
  it 's pretending that those values do n't exist or are n't enshrined in laws , treaties and constitutions that i have an issue with . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giv4o44pryc ) , have a german movie !, 
  ( i love what you 're proposing but that might be rough since loads of stuff has no subtitles/translations , except for the really well known stuff . ), 
   for example the dublin regulation states that refugees must apply for asylum in the first participant country they enter . 
  you 're partially mistaken here . 
  two things need to be mentioned when mentioning the dublin regulation : * 1 ) the country an asylum seeker is sent to needs to have a functioning system where the asylum seeker can be `` properly '' ( as in humanely and according to eu standards ) handled . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure if this is actually * in * the dublin agreement but that 's the perspective of german courts on this issue since decades . 
  * 2 ) ** art 3 ( 2 ) allows every single signatory state to circumvent the entire agreement voluntarily . 
  ** what you 're describing as `` ignoring the treaty '' was completely legitimate and part of the treaty for any country that decided to do so . 
  __________ this issue , specifically for germany since i 'm not sure about other countries , started in 2008 when reports arrived that greeks are n't handling asylum seekers humanely / properly . 
  that 's why in 2009 the german [ highest court ] ( http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/qk20090908_2bvq005609.html ) made the ( temporary ) decision that we ca n't send asylum seekers back to greece at all . 
  2012 our ministry for interior basically said `` fuck this shit '' and used art . 
  3 ( 2 ) for all cases that sought asylum here but should have been sent back to greece instead to prevent these refugees effectively being stuck in limbo . 
  a similar court decision was made in 2010 for italy and 2016 for hungary . 
  when it comes to the syrian refugees specifically a huge role also played that it was seen as a terrible idea to effectively make only eu border states responsible for handling all of it instead of cores taking on responsibility as well . 
  __________ tl ; dr : the entire system the eu had for taking care of refugees was a gigantic shitshow and never intended for the case we saw with syria from my perspective . 
   sorry to say , but this thread reads like a yt comments section . 
  what i find funny/sad is what this thread is also missing : ** a proper source . 
  ** unless i 'm completely blind the chatham house survey this refers to does n't link to the actual survey anywhere : https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/what-do-europeans-think-about-muslim-immigration ________ according to the [ pew survey ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/negative-views-of-minorities-refugees-common-in-eu/ ) ( note how much more in-depth that one actually goes ) which chatham house quotes the topic went e.g. 
  from `` 30 % of germans have an unfavorable opinion of muslims living in germany '' ( i buy that instantly and find it to be reflected in media ) , to `` 53 % of germans think all further migration from muslim majority countries should be stopped '' within roughly 6 months . 
  either one of the surveys was badly done or public opinion shifted massively over the last half year ( which i could also understand ) , but it 's pretty hard to figure that out if all we get is one question and no methodology or anything past a few numbers anywhere . 
   i do n't generalize either way , not all of them are terrible , and neither are they people like us with the same concerns ** and will magically turn into liberal democrats in a generation or two ** . 
  that needs a proper source , that pew link does n't support that at all . 
  what i found [ here ] ( https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article156269271/islam-gebote-stehen-ueber-dem-gesetz-findet-fast-die-haelfte.html ) by a german university specifically about turkish migrants was that while yes , results are pretty disgusting we * do * have clear evidence that 2nd and 3rd generations adjusted much better to our values ( which is the entire idea of at least german migration policies in the first place ) . 
  `` following my religion is more important than the laws of the state that i live in '' , 1st gen 57 % agreed , 2nd +3 rd gen 36 % agreed . 
  `` muslims should aim for a society like it was back in mohammeds times '' , 1st gen 36 % agreed , 2nd +3 rd gen 27 % agreed . 
  `` there is only one true religion '' , 1st gen 40 % agreed , 2nd +3 rd gen 33 % agreed . 
  `` only islam is capable of solving todays problems '' , 1st gen 40 % agreed , 2nd +3 rd gen 33 % agreed . 
  people who agreed with all four sentences : 1st gen 18 % agreed , 2nd +3 rd gen 9 % agreed . 
  __________ other stats mentioned there were that 90 % of them described themselves as happy living in germany , 50 % believed they 're treated socially equal ( the difference is explained as them having objectively good lives but being percepted badly by local populations ) . 
  80 % declared that being under heavy scrutiny after terror attacks makes them angry , 3/4ths are for forbidding books and movies that hurt deeply religious people ( there 's a rough one ) and 2/3rds feels like islam fits into the modern western world - while 2/3rds of germans think the opposite . 
  1/5th said that violence is okay to defend their religion from attacks . 
  those who did n't finish school went down from 40 % in first gen to 13 % in 3rd gen and those who say they speak `` good german '' went from 47 % to 94 % . 
  wearing headscarves went from 41 % to 21 % . 
  4 % described a negative opinion towards germans , 5 % towards christians , 27 % towards atheists ( rip me ) and 21 % towards jewish people ( see , they 're integrating ! ) . 
  ___________ from my personal experience ( obviously ca n't source this one ) this is pretty much in line with how i perceive eastern european immigrants with regards to gay rights for example . 
  3rd generation is , with few exceptions , where i consider most people to be in line with `` german '' values if that makes sense . 
  what 's funny to me is that this is in line with our own people : older people see things much more conservative and confrontational than younger people . 
  in general though with the `` i do n't want to share a democracy with these people '' , i partially agree . 
  i 'm fine with giving them a chance to adjust for a few years but i want them to be sent back if they fail to adjust . 
  the latter point is where our current immigration policies are usually rather retarded . 
  no person that disagrees with our fundamental beliefs and values should be openly cherished , i personally do n't care whether that 's left - right - or religious extremists . 
  ______ oh well , at least i got to translate some stats into english . 
   i 'm making the point that it 's the ` muslim ban ' that drives the protest . 
  not these other issues . 
  so if all those kinks would have been worked out then a ` ban on these muslim majority countries ' would still have led to the same protests . 
  ohhhhh , now i get what you mean !, 
  thanks for taking the time , i would n't have gotten there myself . 
  from my point of view with all of those kinks worked out and implemented in a way that would n't have basically buttraped tsa and other agencies i genuinely would n't have cared much , but i can see an argument that i would have been a minority there . 
  i find it hard to argue with a ban or travel restriction if allies , visas/greencards , dual citzens and all that is respected from an international point of view . 
  i 've seen people argue that even that would be against us law because they 'd first have to * prove * that there 's a threat to national security that this measure prevents but that 's a different topic and nothing that concerns me much from an international point of view . 
  __________________  but i figured it was maybe 50-50 or even 40-60 split . 
  do you think the media and public discourse would be a fair reflection of 40 % of europeans supporting a muslim ban ? 
  what i instantly noticed [ here ] ( https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/what-do-europeans-think-about-muslim-immigration ) ( also am i blind or do they not link the full study anywhere ? ), 
  was the split between young and old populations that could have a significant impact on overall numbers . 
  on top of that there 's also a 10 % disparity between higher and lower education numbers * and * that seems to be overall and not per country . 
  i * could * see that this is a different picture when you break it up for the individual countries but we 'd have to see the full study for this . 
  it just does n't make * that * much sense when it 's listed right next to this :  these results chime with other surveys exploring attitudes to islam in europe . 
  in a [ pew survey ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/negative-views-of-minorities-refugees-common-in-eu/ ) of 10 european countries in 2016 , majorities of the public had an unfavorable view of muslims living in their country in five countries : hungary ( 72 % ) , italy ( 69 % ) , poland ( 66 % ) , greece ( 65 % ) , and spain ( 50 % ) , although those numbers were lower in the uk ( 28 % ) , germany ( 29 % ) and france ( 29 % ) . 
  from `` 30 % of germans have an unfavorable opinion of muslims living in germany '' ( i buy that instantly and find it to be reflected in media ) , to `` 53 % of germans think all further migration from muslim majority countries should be stopped '' is a massive , massive difference . 
  ** one ** of these two results has to be skewed , unless public opinion just shifted that dramatically over the last 6 months ( also understandable due to the berlin attack for example , that not being reflected in media/public discourse within a month or two would also make sense to me ) . 
  _______  it kind of makes me doubt the poll but i 'm sure that at least 40 % would support a ban anyway . 
  which is still a shocking disparity between discourse and public . 
  i would have suspected ~ 20 % ( and would have considered that reflective of the discourse ) , especially since the question is phrased so much harsher than similar questions i know from recent polls ( see above ) . 
  ________ ________ so . . uhm ... just to make sure i 'm not retarded : can ** you ** find the full study ? 
   you mean the lebanon that was once christian and accepted too many muslim immigrants and refugees which plunged the country into a civil war ? 
  yes , because 1 % of the german population being added as refugees is the same as lebanon ( a country with a population of 6 million people that had 50 % + muslim population since almost a 100 years ) taking in 1.5 million refugees . 
  how do you even come up with these nonsensical comparisons ? 
   australia is signatory and they have a sensible policy where they select the refugees that they admit . 
  they also [ shove refugees on islands ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/pitiful-plight-refugees-locked-up-9743949 ) and pretty much let them rot there . 
   what i 'm saying is that all those legit underlying points you bring up ultimately do not drive the protests . 
  maybe they drive it for you personally but overall people are protesting the discrimination against a specific religion . 
  again , that 's imo because that 's how the trump administration * branded it * .
