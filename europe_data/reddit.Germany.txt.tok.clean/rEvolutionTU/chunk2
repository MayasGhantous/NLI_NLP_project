  this has also been a topic in [ various other publications ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/breitbart-donald-trump-expansion-marion-marechal-le-pen-front-national-fn-national-front-a7419521.html ) and also links them together with brexit via someone named [ raheem kassam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raheem_kassam ) , editor-in-chief of breitbart uk . 
  according to an [ english vice article ] ( https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win ) which is based on the swiss interview , while cambridge analytica is not commenting on alleged talks with theresa may , their ceo claims he has received inquiries from switzerland , germany and australia and his company is currently touring european conferences showcasing their success in the united states . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.wired.de/collection/life/nach-cambridge-analytica-wie-arbeiten-die-deutschen-parteien-im-digitalen-wahlkampf ) wired germany article a leading member of the right-wing alternative f\u00fcr deutschland ( afd ) said that they 're debating about which tools they will be using and that `` data analysis or helpful programs that make the daily workload easier '' will most likely be used but also denied that they will use any social bots that automatically make posts . 
  * how credible are all these claims ? 
  what needs to be noted is that according to a [ spiegel online ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/donald-trump-und-die-daten-ingenieure-endlich-eine-erklaerung-mit-der-alles-sinn-ergibt-a-1124439.html ) article most of the claims in the article linked above and other sources are based on comments made by the ceo themselves or people like kosinski who have built the foundation for all of this . 
  it overall needs to be clearly said that we do not know how effective any of these tools really are or if it 's just a marketing gag that cambridge analytica is using to make money . 
  however , what we * do * know is that they 've been on the winning side for brexit , ted cruz 's campaign and donald trumps campaign . 
  we also know that they 're in contact with multiple of the european right-wing populist parties ( they so far exclusively work with ` conservatives ' according to themselves but their ceo also mentioned they 'd work for anyone who 'd hire them ) . 
  if anyone can find clear counter-examples ( or examples ) for what these articles say or suggest that would obviously help all of us along as well . 
  * concluding thoughts : just with all of this in mind alone it might be worth it to get some information out as to what exactly these kinds of automated approaches based on massive collections of data are potentially capable of and how they operate exactly . 
  ** if ** these kinds of methods and approaches become ( or are already ) mainstream the most important aspect is understanding them and being educated about them . 
  at least to me the idea of automated tools scanning my personality via e.g. 
  facebook likes or other online behavior and influencing my choices based on such data is * slightly * concerning to say the least . 
  i hate it when i read comments that sound funny , laugh and then realize : `` well ... he does have a point . '', 
  i 've heard that before from danes and have seen the stats in your history , are they released in english anywhere ? 
  what i know from german stats on the issue is that yes , it shows the same thing as you just mentioned on an obvious level . 
  however , bavaria for example also gets rather close when you start excluding offences a native german ca n't commit ( makes sense ) , exclude tourists ( that 's another 10 % that shows up in our crimerate of foreigners ) and exclude illegals ( that 's another 10-15 % of the total crime committed by non-germans ) . 
  if you then look at all the remaining people and compare them to natives in similar circumstances you do get pretty damn close . 
  sure , one now can argue that these stats should n't be excluded but i do consider at least those groups above as important to distinct when we 're looking at migrants/refugees specifically . 
  another thing is that while for example in one state ( baden-w\u00fcrttemberg ) 44 % of people in prisons are foreigners ( overall german average is still high compared to the eu with 30 % ) the largest increase in 2016 came from [ maghreb states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maghreb ) and the highest numbers overall are from turkey and romania - again not what we associate with the migrant crisis . 
  another example is that for example if we look at crime committed by migrants since september 2015 we find that most crimes ( 25 % ) were committed by syrians but then they 're 50 % of the total amount of people that came here since then - the people who are responsible for a much larger proportion of crime are kosovarians , serbs , albanians , macedonians , eritreans and nigerians . 
  overall the picture over here seems to be that while yes , there are massive issues they 're not the ones most commonly used to justify anti-migrant viewpoints or straight up right-wing propaganda . 
  it definitely does n't seem as simple as it 's sometimes made out to be . 
  you do n't think quotes like the ones below are relevant when someone directly points at some kind of coverup-conspiracy ? 
  all are directly from the user i replied to . 
  but , sure , i 'm terrible for pointing out someone has an * actual * agenda with how he frames his post . 
   exactly , maybe they should look at trump and implement that massive wall plan of his , would be awesome . 
  put it all around europe and ofcourse , a big fat door in the middle , where people can come in legally !, 
   not all european men , my friend . 
  we are biding our time , when the moment arises , we will rise  what i am talking about that when things really get out of hand , european men will be forced to stop being fucking cucks , and i have faith that they will . 
   apparently our donald is more dangerous than an armed clash in the south china sea , this has to be some sort of sick joke !, 
   i seriously have the feeling that many europeans dont like trump because he says things that our politicians should have been saying 20 years ago . 
  ofcourse also because most of them are socialists and believe we should create some sort of utopia where everyone is welcome and lives happily ever after,

   but they quickly blame this on poverty if a native citizen with specific socioeconomic conditions commits a certain amount of crime and an immigrant with similar specific socioeconomic conditions commits a similar amount of crime then ** that is the system working as intended ** . 
  if that 's what the stats result in , then that 's not `` quickly blaming this on poverty '' , it 's using the information we have available responsibly . 
  expecting anything else is completely unreasonable , no matter where on the globe . 
  now , admittedly that this being the exact case that is happening is n't precisely what they said but the sentence `` this means factors such as parents ' incomes , and the social circumstances in the area in which an individual grew up . '', 
  suggests precisely that to me . 
  but then i also got ta admit that if i was someone who vocally supports the man donald himself , loved his wall plan and considers europeans to be cucks i 'd definitely come to a similar conclusion as you . 
  awkward that all these things are factually true about you , is n't it ? 
  it has to be a coverup !, 
  is n't that part of the whole point of the entire exercise ? 
  if i understand things correctly that number is very much on the high end which makes the uk go `` nope , lol '' and that dispute pretty much * needs * to be solved before one can look at the rest of the deal ? 
  holy shit is that embarrassing . 
  ck2 was more real than real life there and [ reading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sk%c3%a5neland ) is overrated . 
  guess just bornholm is left !, 
  i say we grab j\u00fctland and sweden gets sk\u00e5neland . 
  everybody happy !, 
  that 's how it works though . 
  if certain laws are n't referred to for ages then there 's no pressure to change them . 
  that 's why we have so fucking many stupid laws all across the globe , [ here ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4527223.stm ) are a few british examples :  there is still a law in place which requires royal navy ships which enter the port of london to provide a barrel of rum to the constable of the tower of london . 
  analogue germany had no reason to change [ \u00a7 103 ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1035 ) based on which [ erdogan ended up sueing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%b6hmermann_affair ) until someone actually tried using it in this manner . 
  that 's also what allowed merkel to kill multiple birds with one stone : by allowing the case to go forward the law gets challenged in courts , she can still use it to play nice with erdogan * and * the case can be used to help change the law later down the line . 
  either way pretty much anyone can spin these things in any direction , the only thin that matters in the end is if these laws get actually enforced or overturned when they get tested . 
   you have to accept this , especially with shitty public speakers that built their brand on specifically not choosing their words carefully . 
  full agreed , but there are still basic things that even the shittiest public speaker has to get right . 
  if someone nests multiple events within one specific argument as examples to make a point then ** he ** is the one connecting them . 
  if he wants us to assume that they should n't be seen as connected he needs to not put them there in that context . 
   no , you 've still yet to prove how trump is anti democratic . 
  no , i do n't - because i did not make that claim in this chain . 
  switching goal points is a form of censorship too though , one could argue . 
  that bolded statement was your claim that has yet to be proven by the way !, 
  words have meanings . 
  context has meanings . 
  if i refer to terror attack a , terror attack b and terror attack c right after i talk about `` what 's happening in germany '' and `` what 's happening last night in sweden '' while i 'm using all of them combined under the topic of `` we 've got to keep our country safe '' then there 's a direct implication that they 're topically close . 
  that 's how listing things in context works . 
   you look at what 's happening in brussels . 
  you look at what 's happening all over the world . 
  take a look at nice . 
  take a look at paris . 
  he 's continuing the exact same sentence structure ( `` you look at '' ) and frames it within the same argument ( `` keep our country safe '' ) right next to major terror attacks across europe . 
  surely he did n't want to give us a picture of these things having to be seen next to each other . 
  your claim was :  german political culture [ ... ] ** deprives people of a political voice ** becuase ** anything to the contrary to the status quo ** is a danger to liberal democracy . 
  you cited examples of laws against extremist parties which are unconstitutional because they 're literally anti-democratic and laws which allow legal action against extremist viewpoints that people want to advocate for publicly . 
  glad that you found out yourself that your initial claim was completely over the top with no basis in reality . 
   you look at what 's happening in brussels . 
  you look at what 's happening all over the world . 
  take a look at nice . 
  take a look at paris . 
  he was n't referring to belgian chocolate . 
  ** context ** . 
   that being said , yes i get it . 
  no , you still do n't seem to get that i ca n't say two things with similar word choice right after each other without people assuming i was connecting them . 
  also :  german political culture [ ... ] deprives people of a political voice becuase anything to the contrary to the status quo is a danger to liberal democracy . 
  citation needed . 
   `` here 's the bottom line , we 've got to keep our country safe , '' trump said . 
  `` you look at what 's happening . 
  we 've got to keep our country safe . 
  you look at what 's happening in germany . 
  ** you look at what 's happening last night in sweden . 
  ** sweden !, 
  who would believe this ? 
  sweden !,
