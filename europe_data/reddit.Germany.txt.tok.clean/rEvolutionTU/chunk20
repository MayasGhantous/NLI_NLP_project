  i can see how \\ #nobannowall or \\ #nomuslimban or whatever are catchier than \\ #noblanketravelbansandrevocationoflegitimatevisasagainstnationalsofspecificcountries . 
  =p __________  and btw i agree with most europeans in the poll ( though not with trump 's ban because it 's a travel ban rather than immigration ) but that is besides the point . 
  i do n't . 
  i want application of the laws we have , fingerprints , massive pressure against foreign government to take those back that broke laws in the eu or got their status revoked . 
  shit like our ( german ) immigration agencies ** now ** being like `` hm , fingerprints would be a cool idea maybe ? '', 
  is completely out of touch with reality . 
  but so is any blanket ban . 
  if we 're to lead by example we need to set one that 's not straight up telling some areas of the rest of the world : `` you 're all the fucking same , we do n't care . '', 
  i 'm all for you guys just doing a `` france first , america somewhere '' - in french . 
  so ... is n't there * some * clause somewhere in the uk that would mean brexit ca n't happen if it 's the direct reason for scotland seceding because unity of the uk or something ? 
  ; ; i think i remember vaguely that keeping the union stable is considered pretty high up the list for you guys but maybe i 'm uninformed or it works different . 
  is your country signatory of the conventions mentioned above ? 
  if yes , then you 're free to politically move against them because ** your nation ** agreed to them . 
  you ca n't just advocate policies that violate those agreements without advocating against the conventions themselves . 
  also , just to make clear since you 're talking about `` millions of people '' , are you from turkey , libanon or jordan ? 
  cause those are [ the countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war ) who can claim `` millions of refugees '' and not really relevant to the eu . 
   that was over 60 years ago . 
  things were different then . 
  just because something was a good solution then , does n't mean we need to hold on to it until the end of days . 
  that 's completely acceptable . 
  what i ** do n't ** consider acceptable is people arguing for blanket bans which ** as it stands ** would violate those kinds of contracts and values . 
  i do n't see anyone openly advocating to pull out of these kinds of conventions , all i see is people advocating policies that go against it without being intellectually honest on what that actually means . 
  it was mostly [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5smci9/most_europeans_want_immigration_ban_from/ddgjq29/ ) initial post of yours . 
   all of your points are valid . 
  however , people are n't outraged because of any of that ( though the disastrous implementation has had some effect ) . 
  people are principally and ultimately outraged because it is a ban on * gasp muslims !, 
  which apparently most euros agree with . 
  what i 'm reading there is :  your points are valid ** but ** `` people '' do n't care about those valid points . 
   `` people '' are outraged because the ban goes against muslims . 
   and most european want that too !, 
  ______________ from that perspective you first call the points brought up as legitimate but then dismiss them as irrelevant , then you draw a parallel to `` but peaceful religion muslims are our friends they never harm anyone '' - rhetoric ( while again claiming that 's the perspective of the population overall ) , and ** then ** you take all that and use it to justify the `` why do n't we euros ban all muslim immigration too ? '', 
  point of view . 
  _________ did i just misunderstand all that and it got lost somewhere between a few languages ? 
  if yes , i 'm sorry . 
  this thread is quite filled with `` i 'm not right-wing but i would really wish we stopped caring about these geneva conventions when it 's about muslims '' and i might have went too far by throwing you in there after getting the wrong impression from your post . 
  great , then go ahead and advocate pulling the eu or your country out of [ certain conventions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) first before advocating blanket bans that go against them . 
  i would n't even mind that at all because that 's a completely logical chain of thought . 
  what 's illogical is advocating bans that go ** against ** the values we agreed to hold up as ` modern ' and ` western ' by just pretending those never existed in the first place or that they are suddenly irrelevant . 
  i explained why ** i ** was outraged and you 're completely dismissing it as something that 's irrelevant or non-existent . 
  i knew it was n't a `` ban against muslims '' on day one because i simply read the eo and double-checked with commentary i saw in my country . 
  however , like most people even i myself referred to it as `` muslim ban '' ( usually in quotation marks ) because that 's what , thanks to donald & co. , was the established name in the english speaking sphere from day 1 . 
  maybe , just maybe , people are `` principally outraged because its a ban against muslims '' because ** that 's what the us administration called it ** . 
  a nations first responsibility is to it 's citizens and the basic values its society agreed to . 
  what those values are is different for most nations . 
  if you want to openly advocate getting rid of parts of [ conventions we agreed on decades ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) , be my guest . 
  go campaign for it and support the parties who want to get rid of them . 
  wait , hold on , we do n't really have those parties . 
  but do n't pretend those values do n't exist or that my or most likely your country did n't agree to them . 
  is that your answer to `` how the heck are these things not cause for being outraged ? '', 
  or did you choose to shift goal points instead ? 
   i do n't care about saving anyone , we do n't owe them anything . 
  those are some great western values you 're advocating . 
  harsh and proper controls , enforcement of laws already in existence , sure . 
  the us or switzerland did n't owe anything to jews either . 
  i do n't want to be part of that list of countries . 
  any blanket ban in any direction is completely ridiculous , ** especially ** when we 're talking about refugees and not migrants . 
  we already have laws against every single thing you mentioned . 
  we even have ( unlike the us for example ) laws that allow us to intervene long , long before an actual movement forms . 
  they just need to be applied properly without discrimination in either direction . 
  being like `` rarara blanket ban !! '', 
  is n't part of that ideology . 
   all of your points are valid . 
  however , people are n't outraged because of any of that ( though the disastrous implementation has had some effect ) . 
  i was outraged because : * it was n't a ban on muslims or a ban on immigration ( despite the administration saying it , media copying it and then the administration denying it , basically [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex-hjnhsogs ) ) - it was ( is ) the attempt to ban specific nationalities from entering a country because `` terrorism '' . 
  * it affected german and british citizens , including mps and ** every fucking discussion ** ignored that most people ca n't just get rid of their iranian nationality . 
  * it was implemented absolutely incompetent . 
  it took days for the brits to figure out their dual citizens ( they even got conflicting infos at times ) , it took days more for germany to figure it out . 
  no proper information for allies , nothing . 
  also , greencards . 
  a massive chunk of the people affected ** already went through some of the hardest vetting in the world ** . 
  it affected people who worked for the us , who suffered with us troops on the ground . 
  __________ how the heck are these things not cause for being outraged ? 
  or is this where you tell me i 'm an exception and therefor not relevant ? 
   but can we just say ... canada second ? 
  where is your video entry ? 
  good sir , you ca n't just link these atrocities without giving a proper example of how your dishes should be prepared by heathens trying to share their divine glory . 
  please think of us poor souls i beg you !, 
  nah , we germans even have a specific word for the french doing this that made it into the english language : [ plenken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plenken ) . 
  sans freins !, 
  ( man it physically pains me to put that space in front of the exclamation mark , the things we do for cultural understanding . 
  t_t ), 
  [ hhig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_croatia#primary_education ) , das sieht ziemlich genauso aus wie hier in bezug darauf wann ihr welche neuen sprachen lernt . 
  [ til ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_croatia#primary_education ) , that pretty much looks like over here in terms of how many new languages you learn and when . 
   i do n't see how this squares with your supreme belief that upholding freedom of expression is the highest value in your ideal society . 
  simple : if someone openly goes against values that are against democratic/free values or against basic laws then they revoked their right to free speech . 
  * exactly * the same way we handle any other unlawful action . 
  ___________ if a german newspaper writes that for example a church was set on fire by a rabid muslim mob on new years and said newspaper refuses to print a correction that 's visible just as long and clearly as the original message , the community , press and eventually lawmakers can come together and work against it with rules and regulations . 
  if they spread the exact same shit on facebook they 're suddenly above the law ? 
  __________  how do you even begin to legislate of enforce this sort of stuff ? 
  the answer is you ca n't . 
  germany for example does exactly that against the extreme left , the extreme right and everything in between if it has to . 
  that 's why the kkk or wbc do n't exist here . 
  if you want to defend the right to free speech for those groups , feel free to do it - from my point of view nothing of value is lost . 
  ________  the answer in protecting freedom of expression is not to restrict it . 
  that worked really damn well in the us did n't it ? 
  press outlets are n't trusted , news shows are separated into bias that way and bias the other way and the president calls whatever he disagrees with `` fake news '' . 
  messages that disagree with freedom of expression , democracy and basic common values need to be fought when they 're small . 
  if you let them grow until they 're able to exercise real power you already lost the fight . 
  _________ e : just to make sure , when we 're talking about `` simple '' fake news that ** are n't ** openly attacking other groups or values then so far the german plan is to not ban but have a transparent non-profit journalistic organization tack on statements explaining the messages . 
  those are kinda rare though and most of them would technically be covered by existing law .
