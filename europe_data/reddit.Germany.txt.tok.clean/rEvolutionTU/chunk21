  it just needs to be enforced when companies want to freely operate here . 
  oh , sorry , i confused you with one of the other swedish guys in here . 
  i was referring to what was described [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5scxx4/female_genital_mutilation_case_reported_every/dded5c3/ ) or [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5scxx4/female_genital_mutilation_case_reported_every/ddeah9c/ ) . 
  basically , yell at me if i 'm misinterpreting this , it sounds like an overall a bit naive and maybe too open approach . 
  hmmm ... [ english wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden#demographics ) suggests you guys are around 25 % from foreign countries . 
  that 's roughly in the same ball-park as germany . 
  ... why are you so uh . . weird about the current refugees then ? 
  ... just some german-speaking areas in border regions ... ? 
  please ? 
  i want facebook to be held to the same standard as [ any other ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) german press outlet or publisher . 
  if foreign `` media outlets '' want to talk about rabid muslim mobs burning down churches and use social media to spread it to circumvent german regulations it needs to be addressed and i 'll support any country that wants something similar for them . 
  if they want to operate freely in a country they need to be held accountable in the same way as any other company . 
  only since trump i 've heard about german churches being burned down by rabid muslim mobs during new years celebrations . 
  so yes , fuck shit like that being spread around freely when any german press outlet would be under massive scrutiny if it did that . 
  germany has it 's [ press codex ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) that most outlets adhere to the vast majority of time . 
  that 's a big part of what makes the press trustworthy in the first place . 
  if foreign `` media outlets '' want to circumvent that by making up shit and publishing it via social media it needs to be addressed . 
  any country has a right to deal with those who try to circumvent loopholes in their law . 
  they should n't be allowed to hide behind `` but it 's the internet ! '', 
  when they want to operate in said country . 
  i 'd love to hear some context by french people on what the * actual * plan is . 
  for example the german approach is that highly shared and reported posts on facebook will be sent to the non-profit and as transparent as it gets [ correctiv ] ( https://correctiv.org/en/ ) who are supposed to ** add ** a comment to the post elaborating on the claim with sources . 
  since that announcement they 're also under [ heavy threats and attacks ] ( https://correctiv.org/blog/2017/01/29/uebergriffe-und-wirkungen/ ) ( sadly that one is only in german but i 'll go into more detail if requested ) and under federal police protection because of that . 
  did anyone say anschluss ? 
  the current planned approach is that facebook passes highly shared and reported posts on to [ correctiv ] ( https://correctiv.org/en/ ) ( great transparent and non-profit outlet btw , their english series are pretty amazing as well ) who then are tasked with * adding * a statement that explains the validity of the post . 
  [ here ] ( https://correctiv.org/blog/2017/01/20/warum-wollt-ihr-fuer-facebook-fakten-checken/ ) is the concept explained in german . 
  they 're also under [ massive threats and attacks ] ( https://correctiv.org/blog/2017/01/29/uebergriffe-und-wirkungen/ ) already and under federal police protection because of it . 
   if i 'm honest have you seen a lot of proper fake news stuff in german ? 
  yes . 
  it 's mostly confined to facebook/twitter and non-german outlets trying to publish in german but it 's definitely around . 
  goes for pretty much all directions lately in europe , did you know the [ eu bans baptising children ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/eu-bans-baptising-children/ ) for example ? 
  i am of the firm belief that the most important value of a free and democratic country are not freedom of expression and being a democracy themselves ( those are second ) but the most crucial values are ** upholding ** freedom of expression and democracy . 
  those who want to abuse those rights to argue against freedom , democracy or basic values society agreed upon can fuck right off . 
  or to go paraphrase a more fundamental quote by [ carlo schmid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carlo_schmid_ ( german_politician \\ ) ) , it is not part of a democracy that democracy itself allows for its removal . 
  i tried teaching some of those americans about freedom and democracy the other day and finally understood why they have n't heard about it : * [ original ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) * [ english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ), 
  i * think * what he 's describing is that the scale is weighted , so that it 's rather hard to get the best grade and rather hard to get the worst grade . 
  idea would be that you need to be * really * good to get top grades and you need to be * clearly * bad to fail subjects , i presume ? 
  not too long ago i realized that you guys took proportionally roughly as many refugees as germany - but without 50 + years of experience and systems in place to handle migrants who do n't speak the language or are sometimes not even remotely related to the local culture . 
  to me sweden as a country being like `` ah , we do n't care we can handle that at least as well ! '', 
  is just delusional . 
  what sucks is that this is a clear policy / political / ideology fuckup and i 'm afraid it 's going to get misused by just blaming those damn refugees . 
  and rightfully so , you guys have just set an absolutely amazing example . 
  oh come on , you 're the guys with the radio quotas . 
  =p also i trust you guys enough to not go batshit insane . 
  i 'd like to think both our grandparents and great-grandparents were pretty good teachers when it comes to this . 
  out of curiosity , are there any representative polls in france about what you guys think about germany/the eu ? 
  over here in the poll a few days back , the one that had `` which countries do you consider trustworthy ? 
  '' , russia and the us scraped around 25 % with good ol' france being at 90 % . 
  pretty safe to say that germans overall like you guys . 
  we 'll do the best we can to ensure that * we * get to make surrender jokes about you instead of some dickfucks across the pond . 
   romania , we are so proud of you !, 
  this so much . 
  and between your peaceful ways , your persistence and your flowers you 've been an amazing example for the rest of europe and the world . 
  thank you !, 
  _______ and i 'll probably not forget [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf4z2eeh9_s ) `` joke '' you guys linked in here for a while . 
  if someone tells me that iceland is on the equator and he , after showing it to him on a map , on a globe and after showing him pictures of the country , still maintains his position then while i do feel some pity it 's mostly anger . 
  and i 'm pretty sure it 's not because `` i 'm subconsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as i do '' , it 's because he 's being a complete and absolute moron and i ca n't reconcile that with the idea that he 's still the exact same human being as me . 
   spain and portugal experienced actual fascism . 
  that quote struck me as somewhat eerie . 
  to me , as a german , i always saw french as more nationalistic than most nations but i would never , never expect them to move towards * genuine * fascism which is the direction lepen stands for . 
  i can understand that the us did n't learn from germany and other fascist nations in europe to at least a certain extent but if countries like france or even poland end up showing us that they did n't learn how terrible extreme nationalism ends up for everyone on the continent then ... 
  i do n't know . 
  that idea feels like an inherently german failure to me . 
  that 's the one topic this nation had a chance of convincing the world of . 
  so you ** ca n't ** point out how many german or british citizens or green card holders were not allowed initially in the us under obamas order ? 
  fun fact , the eu has the so called [ east stratcom task force ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/2116/%20questions%20and%20answers%20about%20the%20east%20stratcom%20task%20force ) which was set up in 2015 `` to address russia 's ongoing disinformation campaigns '' . 
  their [ main project ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ ) , even though it always reminds me of pretty much any conspiracy site ever invented , has some pretty interesting stuff around . 
  i 'm learning so much shit from these random shitvideos . 
   after living in a wild east , savage romania , i ' , m fucking amazed by the level of civilization we bring at protests , i mean people ( lots ) are bringing kids . 
  honestly , what you guys are doing over there is some of the most impressive civilian resistance i 've seen during my lifetime . 
  you 're amazing , keep it up . 
  cheers , my bad then !, 
  i 'm actually surprised your comment is marked as controversial . 
  next thing people downvote someone mentioning that the successor of mr `` gays and feminists helped 9/11 happen '' is in charge of educational policies . 
  or that the `` countering violent extremism '' program will now be the `` countering islamic extremism '' program because no other form of extremism matters . 
  or that trump wants to allow political parties to gather unlimited amounts of money in the form of tax exempt donations from religious organisations . 
  did n't know that quote either , thanks for sharing . 
  should * probably * also be one that more people know about . . 
   and it is absolutely evil . 
  no , * you * are evil if you are against the christian militia that will eradicate islam !, 
  `` never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity , unless the person could nuke you at any time . '', 
  - abraham lincoln , 1939, 
  i 'm fully aware of `` allahu akbar my microwave dinner is finished '' / r/turkey jokes . 
  =p it ** does ** matter however if you 're saying `` someone shouted that and it turned out that it was ( aka the someone who was shouting was ) some crazy far-right guy '' . 
  you made a claim i have n't heard confirmed , i 'm asking for a confirmation . 
  unless you meant it more broadly as in `` someone shouted that and it turned out the perpetrator was some crazy far-right guy '' , then i 'm sorry for misunderstanding you . 
   obama did the same thing , etc etc. 
  maybe i was ignorant but could you point out how many german and british citizens or how many green card holders were n't initially allowed in the us anymore under obamas `` ban '' ? 
  we did have a case of cnn literally making up a witness that claimed a certain shooter was shouting `` allahu ackbar '' while shooting children ... 
  i did n't pay close attention to that one , was that shout coming specifically from * the attacker * or one of the victims/bystanders ? 
  was that ever confirmed in either direction ? 
  you 're thinking of swabians , those are the guys always trying to save money . 
  eh , i do n't mind paying a bit too much from time to time to try shit . 
  i 'm way too german to appreciate the average eastern-european hospitality on a regular basis . 
  =p i love it , but it still makes me feel super awkward so i tend to avoid it . 
   i get linie aquavit for like 18 $ 0,7 l in edeka and ca . 
  25 $ for 0,7 l chivas . 
  [ same price ] ( https://www.amazon.de/linie-655116-aquavit-0-7/dp/b004eafam0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1486027336&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=linie+aquavit ) and [ same for chivas ] ( https://www.amazon.de/chivas-regal-limited-bremont-company/dp/b00o9xn2ng/ref=sr_1_9?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1486027369&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=chivas ) !, 
  so weird , looks like we 're just getting ripped off with the debowa/zoladkowa . 
  that 's roughly the average price for `` good '' alcohol here .
