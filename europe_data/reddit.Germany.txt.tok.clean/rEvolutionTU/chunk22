  bombay sapphire gin costs right around that range too for example ( 30 $ / l ) . 
  the `` decent '' tier ( \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa ) is in the 17 $ / l range . 
  a trip to poland for a haul with a couple bottles is worth it pretty quickly if you 're somewhat close . 
   not here in nl at least uhm , can you guys order from german amazon ? 
  we can order both \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa and d\u0119bowa from there !, 
  alright , it 's ordered !, 
  black sounds tempting as hell too ... mhmmmmm ... ( ... also i never had issues with \u017bo\u0142\u0105dkowa , do n't be * that * mean to it ! ), 
   d\u0119bowa alright , which am i buying ? 
  golden oak ? 
  red oak ? 
  white oak ? 
  black oak ? 
  . . why all these colors and what 's the difference ?

  buy buy buy best vodka eu best vodka world . 
  so is [ ptasie mleczko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ptasie_mleczko ) . 
  basically if you 're friends or somewhat family with anyone from poland you will drown in sweets , vodka and food whenever you 're anywhere close to them . 
  a + ______ also cd projekt is a great company that never disappointed me . 
  / u/sflm _ mpmpmpmp a bit [ higher up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r848h/trump_signs_no_privacy_for_nonamericans_order/dd5idly/ ) just mentioned https://www.qwant.com and i 'm ** really ** digging it clicking around a bit . 
  __________ while i 'm summoning that guy anyway two things i 'm missing are : * [ duckduckgos bangs ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/bang ) ( this means right now i need to use duckduckgo as my default search engine and use ! qw to search with qwent - at least that shortcut beats ! g < 3 ) * selecting `` international '' or `` none '' as my search region in the top right . 
  sometimes i just want to swap quickly between search results in various languages/regions , which works decent with google.com but might be a bit awkward here . 
  ______ e : found out about [ qwick ] ( https://www.qwant.com/qwick ) , is there any way to configure what character is in front there ? 
  '' & '' might be one of the worst character on e.g. 
  a [ german ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/kb_germany.svg/550px-kb_germany.svg.png ) keyboard layout since it 's shift +6 . 
  keep in mind that the eu east stratcom task force is issueing [ these ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/commentary-means-goals-and-consequences-of-the-pro-kremlin-disinformation-campaign/ ) types of reviews more and more . 
  at this point it would be a surprise if there * wo n't * be russian campaigns to influence the french and german elections . 
  oh , * now * i understand where you 're coming from . 
   later , a far-right driver killed a person after driving into a crowd of antifa activists . 
  can you source this claim please ? 
   banning what you disagree with ? 
  it 's not about banning what you disagree with . 
  it 's about banning anti-democratic elements in a democratic society . 
  if you give absolutely * everyone * complete freedom of speech then you have to live with all kinds of things spreading freely and eventually , given enough time , becoming majority opinion . 
  those who 'd like to tear down the current system will always have more tools at their disposal to achieve this since there is no incentive to play ` fair ' from that angle . 
   far-right were protesting the removal of a civil war statue to add some perspective [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/chuckmodi1/status/896409728959606789 ) video showing civilians with shields , helmets and sticks beating up a black guy was part of the `` protest '' it seems . 
   i 'd rather have freedom of speech and ignore these shits , than have them be silenced and thus risk the entire foundation of freedom for it . 
  freedom of speech and democracy are not meant to be used as tools by those who want to rid society of these things . 
  at least that 's the german take on it . 
  democracy is n't something that you start and that just keeps on rolling , it 's something that has to be cherished , supported and protected - just like any other ideology . 
  also note that there is n't a single democratic country on earth without restrictions to free speech , they just have different perspectives on what exactly should be regulated . 
  ( i was referring to / u/thebiggreengun , not messner . 
   wow , people still remember that ? 
  he 's swiss , it 's about mountains . 
  of course he remembers . 
  personally i associate messner more with yetis than that . 
  ... she was also the person who literally enabled the vote , knowing that her statement would guarantee it passing . 
  that kinda has to be mentioned in context . 
  now , that statement * could * have been an accident but whether it actually was or not is something we 'll never know . 
  * 1 ) enable vote on a key election topic , knowing it will pass and now ca n't be used against you anymore . 
  * 2 ) turn around to your voters and be able to say '' * i * voted against it , the majority wanted it '' , while basing her reasoning on a sound ( but kind of irrelevant ) former court decision . 
  \\ #politics, 
  [ these ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/mzkwwduyma==/z/zguaaoswd0bv5bfk/$_1.jpg ) things ( self-adhering ( ? ), 
  bandages ) for spots where your clothing interconnects are also glorious . 
  what helps is shoving your trousers into your socks/shoes , adding [ these ] ( http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/mzkwwduyma==/z/zguaaoswd0bv5bfk/$_1.jpg ) kinds of bandages on top and you 're good to go . 
  worked wonders for doing things in rough/woody terrain . 
  sounds like it 's time to repost [ this advice ] ( https://www.croatiaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18768398_1177483532361910_2975456972329779066_o.jpg ) from the croation mountain rescue service . 
  see , sandals are okay - they 're only mentioning flip-flops !, 
  the main reason for step 3 ) is that the other way around sometimes looks like the case of [ david headley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_headley ) , a us citizen who was involved in the [ 2008 mumbai attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_mumbai_attacks ) during which 199 people died and 600 + were injured . 
  you can guess who reserved the right to judge him . 
  ______  if he hacked the italian , swedish or french military i 'd be for his extradition to the relevant country . 
  we do n't let our private citizens attack our allies . 
  the main difference here from a german standpoint is that we extradite to eu countries and the icc , an institution the us pretty much ditched in 2002 because it does n't want its citizens judged by a non-us authority in general . 
  if i understand things correctly the [ uk-us extradition treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk%e2%80%93us_extradition_treaty_of_2003 ) for example also has some controversy around it and it does n't seem 100 % clear how high the standard is for each side . 
   from january 2004 to the end of december 2011 , 7 known us citizens were extradited from the us to the uk . 
  no us citizen was extradited for an alleged crime while the person was based in the us . 
  . .  from january 2004 to the end of december 2011 , 33 known uk citizens ( including 6 with dual nationality ) were extradited from the uk to the us . 
  the u.s. embassy in london reports that , as of april 2013 , 77 individuals have been extradited from the uk to the us . 
  the u.s. has argued that this is not disproportionate , due to the us population being about five times larger than the uk population . 
   germany does n't extradite people to the us on principle while * technically * correct germany does n't extradite to anyone except for eu states or to the icc . 
  i explained the overall situation in detail [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qa08p/british_hacker_lauri_love_id_rather_kill_myself/dkw4w7z/ ) but the gist is the us does n't want it 's citizens to be judged by international courts * or * file lawsuits in another country so german citizens are protected by the exact same standard . 
  i would n't mind if that kind of thing became an eu standard in the long run at all . 
  why should people be judged in a foreign country if that country refuses that it 's own citizens are judged by an international court ? 
   some countries , such as ** austria ** , brazil , ** the czech republic ** , ** france ** , ** germany ** , japan , the people 's republic of china , the republic of china ( taiwan ) , russia , ** switzerland ** and syria forbid extradition of their own citizens . 
  these countries often have laws in place that give them jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad by or against citizens . 
  by virtue of such jurisdiction , they prosecute and try citizens accused of crimes committed abroad as if the crime had occurred within the country 's borders ( see , e.g. , trial of xiao zhen ) . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extradition ) _______ notably this creates some funny scenarios to my knowledge . 
  for example if the us wants to prosecute one of the german volkswagen executives they 're quite literally out of luck with their current stance . 
  * germany only extradites to eu countries or the icc . 
  * in 2002 [ the us pulled out of the icc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_and_the_international_criminal_court ) ( together with sudan and israel ) ( \\* ) - the list they joined looks like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/states_parties_to_the_rome_statute_of_the_international_criminal_court#non-party.2c_non-signatory_states ) today . 
  the [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/states_parties_to_the_rome_statute_of_the_international_criminal_court#/media/file:icc_member_states.svg ) is a bit messier but you get the idea . 
  note that lebanon and iraq likely are n't signatories due to us/israeli pressure , at least according to that wiki article . 
  * the us , to my understanding , does n't want to sue in germany either . 
  in practice this means that e.g. 
  interpol can arrest these people if they leave germany and extradite but as long as they stay in germany only lawsuits from eu countries/those that recognize the icc/german courts can be followed up on . 
  _________ ( \\* ) that 's also the time from which the ~ ~ den haag invasion act ~ ~ [ american service-members ' protection act ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_service-members%27_protection_act ) stems from to ensure immunity of us military personnel or government officials from any kind of international criminal court by whatever means necessary . 
   i do n't know what the definition of a neo-nazi is exactly . 
  i just correlated it to being the same as a nazi , but then just present day . 
  and one of the nazi ideology 's core beliefs is the destruction of democracy . 
  that 's why i could n't put them on the same level as say blood and honor . 
  i 'm honestly not sure either if there are `` official '' definitions somewhere . 
  the german perspective here is ( analogue to the [ english wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-nazism ) ) that they 're people who take elements from national socialist viewpoints . 
  in germany specifically they 're seen in contrast to `` altnazis '' ( literally ` old nazis ' ) , people who were involved in the nazi regime in one way or another and started parties like the srp or ndp . 
  what this means in practice is that it 's a pretty wide and diverse group . 
  antisemitism , hate against foreigners , ethnic purity , social darwinist views , holocaust denial , the whole package . 
  in practice if someone subscribes to one of these things we refer to him as someone who does that specifically ( `` antisemite '' ) , when someone subscribes to multiple of these things and usually also is active in some way shape or form `` neonazi '' becomes more common . 
  basically not every neonazi goes full blood and honour but if someone talks about ~ ~ ethnical purity ~ ~ ethnopluralism , is vehemently against foreigners or foreign looking people in general because of them being foreign and all in all goes that extra mile further to the right it 's not a massively unfair category , at least from my perspective . 
  talk of globalist elites * can * also sound very , very similar to jewish conspiracy theories depending on the context . 
  to put this in numbers in 2010 german authorities assumed roughly 5000 neonazis total but also 10000 total potentially violent right-wing extremists . 
  [ in the numbers for 2015 ] ( https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/arbeitsfelder/af-rechtsextremismus/zahlen-und-fakten-rechtsextremismus/zuf-re-2015-personenpotenzial ) we 're talking about 20000 right-wing extremists total out of which 10000 are classified as `` potentially violent '' and 5000 as `` neonazis '' .
