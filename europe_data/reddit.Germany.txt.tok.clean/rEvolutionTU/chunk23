  in the same timeframe violent crime from that scene [ doubled ] ( https://www.verfassungsschutz.de/de/arbeitsfelder/af-rechtsextremismus/zahlen-und-fakten-rechtsextremismus/zuf-re-2015-straf-und-gewalttaten ) from 762 to 1408 cases . 
  kind of surprised there seems to be no more recent stat , so that will have to do . 
  __________  in reality , there are different degrees to which this stuff can be applied . 
  you can go really far with it and create ghettos , but this can not pass in a functioning democracy . 
  but a policy of targeted cultural funding on the other hand is also the same ideology , but is a lot less harmful . 
  promoting local cultural activities instead of throwing funds at eid parties or those multi cultural promoting festivals . 
  organizing patriotic events at certain holidays , things like that . 
  i definitely see where you 're coming from , the main issue is that these are sometimes thin lines . 
  a festival by local people to which everyone is invited and ` outsiders ' are introduced to the other culture ? 
  great . 
  integration is usually a two-way street and that 's where things like that can be crucial . 
  for me it 's when it becomes about celebrating your own culture at the expense of others or framed as a conflict that this becomes an issue . 
  notably i 'm blaming for example the german right here just as much as turkish right who celebrate erdogan nowadays . 
  both are minorities on their respective side but both pose a danger to the overall understanding between the groups . 
   i guess my point is , that as long as it remains democratic and non violent , i ca n't take issue with it , regardless of the past . 
  i mean , we 've taken over policies thought up by communists in the past as well . 
  i massively disagree here . 
  the tools of democracy and freedom are not meant to be used by people who seek to destroy those very things . 
  this * is * definitely a german-centric view , after all our system is designed as a [ militant democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) , but it 's also one i consider genuinely crucial in general . 
  it 's up to for example germany as a state , institution and overall population to * not * let a party like the npd freely spread propaganda . 
  democracy is n't a ball that you start rolling and that just keeps going , there are always elements within a state whether from the left , right , religious or any other direction that seek to actively undermine it . 
  if such a genuine extremist group would find ways to undermine institutions , media and be celebrated by more and more people in belgium i 'm sure you would n't appreciate it either . 
  that process has to be addressed in multiple ways sooner rather than before it gains momentum . 
  this was probably best summed up by our latest highest court decision regarding the banning of the npd , in a nutshell the courts found that while yes the party * is * anti-constitutional it 's also too irrelevant to actually * act * on that anti-constitutionalism . 
  hence it is not being banned for the time being . 
  if they 'd grow in strength i do n't mind such action being taken at all . 
  i 'd rather see a nation try to balance that thin line than give in to extreme-populism because ` the people wanted it that way ' . 
  __________  even though it 's anecdotal , i 'm just going to say i believe you . 
  people are capable of doing shitty things like that , and i hope they are caught . 
  i also hope it does n't escalate into what antifa have done in the past . 
  as for people getting caught , police summed it up as unlikely unless they * do * something that they can be caught for . 
  cameras were installed , neighbours and friends informed . 
  the letters are machine-written and anonymous ( and stopped coming to the house once cameras were installed , the next one was put on his car when he parked at a school ) and that 's hopefully the end of it once they lose interest . 
  they 're definitely smart about how they choose to do things . 
  if you 're further curious [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zeit.de%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2f2017-04%2fidentitaere-bewegung-rechtsextremismus-neonazis-mitglieder ) is a reasonable google-translated article about one of these small localized groups and backgrounds about them . 
  the way i see it i make no difference between someone from left , right or religious viewpoints . 
  if you harm other human beings , threaten to harm them or actively push ideologies that encourage others to see other human beings as inferior humans in some way shape or form then it 's in my opinion up to the state and the population to say : `` screw this crap , not wanted here . '', 
  where my bias kicks in is usually how these groups prioritize their targets - i , like most average people , am most likely to be hurt by a right-wing extremist and least likely to be hurt by a left-wing extremist . 
  i do n't mean to excuse any side being violent with this ( and if i was police i might put left-wingers at # 1 ) but that 's the gist of why i 'm considering the right more dangerous than the left . 
  either way , thanks for your perspectives and i hope you have a nice day . 
  e : this got a bit longer than i expected it to end up but you do sound like someone who cares , so maybe it 's worth it . 
  the slogan `` germany for germans , turkey for turks '' stems from that era . 
  that 's the * exact * same basic tenant that we 're now hearing by so-called ethnopluralists , they 're just packaging it a bit more nicely . 
  as a sidenote , being a neonazi has nothing to do with actually being violent , we have plenty of them over here who are n't . 
  at a similar time france had the [ grece ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groupement_de_recherche_et_d%27%c3%a9tudes_pour_la_civilisation_europ%c3%a9enne ) which built the foundation for the so-called [ thule-seminar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thule-seminar ) , a german neo-nazi paganist group . 
  back in 1989 the german ` newspaper ' [ junge freiheit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junge_freiheit ) , which is nowadays referred to as a spokespaper for the new right in germany , introduced ` ethnopluralism ' as its own topic they 're publishing articles under - this was later renamed to `` issues of nationality '' . 
  ethnopluralism is only superficially something that sounds liberal and pluralistic , the core values are about segregation of ethnical groups . 
  at their core the german [ neue rechte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neue_rechte ) and the french [ nouvelle droite ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nouvelle_droite ) ( `` new right '' is the literal translation for both of these ) both have these kinds of ideologies and they 're all intertwined through various organizations and their histories . 
  some of them are fundamentally anti-democratic , some are militant , some are n't . 
  what they * do * share in common nowadays is both ethnopluralism as a way of framing neonazi ideas as ` modern ' and ` acceptable ' and the goal of trying to take over conservative groups by claiming they 're the * actual * conservatives and everyone else is selling out to globalists , jews , sjws , take your pick . 
  hell , richard spencer was another self-proclaimed identitarian who * literally * [ used hitler salutes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk ) and `` hail trump '' - does it need to get more obvious ? 
  =p basically , especially as someone who thinks conservatives and regular right-wing views are just as crucial for functioning societies as their opposites all i can do is encourage you to read up on those groups , what kind of things they go back to and how their approach to propaganda works . 
  they 're * not * merely conservatives but extremists by every definition of the word . 
  that 's why quite a few of these groups are also under surveillance in germany because they are tightly intertwined with what we usually refer to as plain and simple neonazis . 
  _______ as a personal sidenote the only reason i even started digging into this myself is because a friend of mine is currently being threatened by identitarians after he called out a local group in an article about their criminal activity . 
  they figured out his name and he 's now receiving mail that includes mentions of where his daughters go to school , who their friends are and similar fun things . 
  authorities and cameras are involved already but that 's the `` non-violence '' i witnessed second-hand from that type of group . 
  it 's also usually difficult to find sources talking about these things in english , i 'd assume it 's similar for the cases in france . 
  these things just do n't make international news , only very few of them actually get arrested for terrorism related incidents and all in all there 's not that many of them . 
  but they * are * a thing and should not be underestimated or accepted as a part of `` the right '' or conservatives in general . 
  considering oneself `` right-wing '' or conservative is totally fine . 
  it 's just that lauren southern is n't exactly that , she 's quite a bit further right according to herself . 
  i mostly used `` right-wing association '' as a euphemism here since she 's pretty deep into the [ identitarian movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identitarian_movement ) and it 's visions of ethnopluralism ( just like richard spencer for example ) . 
  at least over here that 's as far right-extremist as you get nowadays . 
  in a nutshell that movement is all about rebranding traditional right-wing extremist ideas , in the sense of : `` oh , we do n't mind turkish people at all !, 
  they should be proud and celebrate their culture just like we do !, 
  but they should do that in their very own isolated areas so we can keep our cultures pure !, 
  - see , we 're not racist at all ! '', 
  if that sounds a bit like `` we do n't mind jews at all - look , we even build them ghettos where they can live among themselves and strive ! '', 
  then that 's because the mindset behind it is precisely the same . 
  that 's why the identitarian movement as a whole is usually mentioned right next to other neo-nazi organisations in germany , the main difference is the modern `` hip '' and `` cool '' rebranding of the same basic ideas . 
  alright , now i see where you 're coming from . 
  i assumed they * literally * introduced some kind of ` relocation program for brown people ' , called it ` madagascar plan ' and i somehow completely missed it . 
  did n't realize you 're `` only '' referring to the usual shitstorm at this point . 
  but yeah , the parties who are calling for those kinds of approaches over here are usually called out by the press for it . 
  in most cases it 's enough to simply quote them which results the average german voter trying to distance themselves from them . 
  it also helps that our major parties and merkel especially are flexible enough to adjust their stances to something more favored by voters in general - sometimes that 's a good thing , sometimes that 's a bad thing . 
  but it * does * keep extremists at bay from all kinds of angles . 
  even if you leave out all her right-wing associations she 's also a pretty proud denier of climate change on top of it all . 
  i find most of those pretty disgraceful personally . 
   wow you do n't know what 3 % budget deficit or 60 % of gdp govt debt are ? 
  neither `` 3 % '' , nor `` 60 % '' nor `` deficit '' are mentioned in the article you linked either . 
   i am not here to do your homework for you and if you are so ill informed why are you commenting on these threads ? 
  ** you ** linked an article as the source for the claim `` the french and germans refuse to follow several eu rules '' , yet as i pointed out i was unable to find any such comment in the article you linked . 
  not to mention the article specifically calls out germany and france as * complying * with eu legislation which clearly contradicts your claim . 
  it 's up to * you * to link a proper source that you understand and that substantiates your claim , not for me to just assume you linked a random article that has nothing to do with what you said in the first place . 
  i missed that entirely , got a link for me ? 
  googling for `` madagascar plan republicans '' mostly brought out nazi topics , that 's why i asked confusedly in the first place . 
  could you point out where in that article france or germany ` refusing to follow several eu laws ' is mentioned ? 
  ctrl + f for `` refuse '' , `` rule '' , `` violation '' or `` law '' all have not yielded any results but this paragraph that seems like something were referring to contradicts you straight up :  because energy is so important , it has long been seen as a proper area for government policy . 
  ** france and germany have done their best to comply only minimally with the requirements of eu legislation ** what i personally get out of that is that , if these scenarios are an issue , then eu legislation is too lax - not that there are violations being committed . 
   promised the madagascar plan like the republicans did they did ... what ? 
  you meant like the nazis did , right ? 
  :3  would you not expect their opponents to rant about how evil they are ? 
  yes , i would . 
  the thing however is that for the most part fringe groups show openly enough what they actually want - it 's an overall media landscape that is held to a higher standard that keeps them accountable . 
  sure in some cases that fails but all in all i have a genuinely hard time listening to most us outlets simply because they 're turning pretty much any event into a circus . 
  what in my opinion makes germany ` strong ' in this regard is a combination of culture , the system itself that was designed with the ` mistakes ' of other and previous systems in mind and a pretty decent press culture overall . 
   it primarily encourages center politics as the vast majority of voters are the `` silent majority '' , ie those who are not politically active , except on voting day . 
  i think that 's a bit imprecise , maybe i did n't articulate myself clearly enough .
