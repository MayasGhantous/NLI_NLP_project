  it encourages center * politics * ( in the classic sense of [ hotelling 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotelling%27s_law ) which pretty much sums up why such a large proportion of americans is dissatisfied with the current administration . 
  but it * also * encourages the respective parties to demonize the other side since emotional engagement leads to more voter turnout . 
  this is only further exacerbated by how the electoral college influences campaigning , e.g. 
  a blue state being * literally * worthless to a red candidate means that it will be ignored more and be less relevant in the overall approach to voters - widening the gap even further . 
  _______ as for party institutions being weak , thanks for bringing that up those are some pretty good points . 
  how does this coexist with the classic `` party before country '' - memes that seemed pretty real to an outside observer during/after the election ? 
  does everyone huddle together until they 're in power and only then these conflicts become obvious ? 
  that 's a differentiation that * in practice * is pretty much irrelevant because the core tenants of fascist views do n't change , just like the basic appeals and methods of populists do n't change . 
  yes , there are obvious differences ( e.g. 
  the us version being draped in stars and stripes with the german version being draped with swastikas ) but these are in the end superficial differences . 
  hence , when referred to `` donald trump style populism '' what the article talks about is trump as a fringe populist . 
  a takeover by a fringe group ( e.g. 
  the far-right or the far-left ) in germany is unthinkable at this point not because ` american populism does n't work in germany ' but because of fundamental differences in the approach to politics and an entire system designed around someone like that * not * being able to come to power . 
  it 's not specifically * american populism * the german system is averse to but * any * populism . 
  the best example of this in practice is how extremely boring our electoral campaigns have been since decades , especially when compared to the us . 
  all in all germans * like * their politics boring while the us seems to prefer brawls of ideally epic proportion as if it was a hollywood movie more and more lately . 
  i 've heard that before , my main question would be * why * that happens all the time over there . 
  for example , if any german party would start ranting how evil their opponents are in the democrats vs republicans style they 'd simply not get my vote at all and i 'd hope most germany see it similar . 
  why do you still vote for those kinds of parties then ? 
  what 's the difference between `` american style fascism '' and `` german style fascism '' ? 
  without knowing the original german quote : what you said :  people in government are seriously talking about forcing protesters to wear ankle bracelets what he said :  speaking to german media , the interior minister said rioters should not be allowed to attend rallies . 
   instead , they should be made to report to police and wear tags if necessary , as should `` highly aggressive so-called football fans '' . 
  if someone is a known and convicted rioter then yeah , why not make sentences that allow for them being tagged part of the deal ? 
  that 's a * slight * difference to `` forcing protesters to wear ankle bracelets '' , do n't you think ? 
   german fascism would never work in america because its german fascism . 
  you mean like the '' [ america first party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america_first_party_ ( 1944 \\ ) ) '' in the 1940s that later renamed itself to the '' [ christian nationalist crusade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_nationalist_crusade ) '' ? 
  surely the '' [ america first party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america_first_party_ ( 2002 \\ ) ) '' from 2002 and a certain slogan we 're hearing a lot lately have * nothing * to do with those roots . 
  amusingly enough * that * 2002 iteration of the `` america first party '' was a splinter group of the so-called `` reform party '' . 
  a certain [ donald trump campaigned for president under that banner in 2002 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_trump_presidential_campaign,_2000 ) . 
  neither is `` american populism '' unique to americans nor is `` german fascism '' unique to germans . 
  there 's a reason someone like richard spencer brought out the good old [ `` hail trump !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk ) and hitler salutes . 
   he also wanted to stop the h1b visa abuse not to downplay that it * does * happen but i just recently found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=711vklh-4fa&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1041 ) short bit by michio kaku on the topic of h1b visas which puts a bit of a different context on this wikipedia quote :  on march 3 , 2017 the u.s. 
  citizenship and immigration service announced on their website that starting from april 3 , 2017 they would temporarily suspend premium processing for all h-1b visa petitions until further notice . 
  on april 18 , 2017 president trump signed a `` buy american , hire american '' executive order which sets broad policy intentions directing federal agencies to propose reforms to the h-1b visa system . 
  this type of recent change is , if i understand things correctly , celebrated by e.g. 
  india because it means the us can no longer poach their top talents and as a result will make them much more competitive in the upcoming years . 
   and the population see itself as being on the rise i can see how that perspective seems reasonable , especially when looking at most of the things that make it into international news , but in practice that 's not what it looks like at all for the majority of the population . 
  while gdp and average income ( ! ), 
  are going up income inequality * also * went up pretty substantially - you can blame a part of our rise in populism over the last couple years on these types of factors . 
  another massive factor is how imbalanced our political landscape still is . 
  back around the 2000s our left-green government at the time implemented what amounts to conservative/right-wing ideals when it comes to social security and work related reforms . 
  it 's safe to say that they * still * have n't recovered voters and trust in general since back then . 
  [ this graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/german_parliamentary_elections_diagram_de.svg ) of election results show that reasonably well in a nutshell . 
  note where that red line ended up . 
  as a sidenote the chancellor from that time is on the board of [ nord stream ag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream9 ( gazprom ) and recently celebrated his 70th birthday with putin . 
   another sign that economic inequality has risen in germany can be seen in the fact that the number of germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11 % in 2001 , [ 10 ] to 12.3 % in 2004 , [ 11 ] and about 14 % in 2007 . 
  according to 2007 government statistics , one out of every six children was poor , a post-1960-record , with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  [ [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010#consequences ) ], 
  two party systems are ** extremely ** beneficial to the two parties . 
  whichever side splinters loses power , hence you can neither split up to promote a different idea nor is there any interest in changing it when you 're ahead . 
  while i ca n't source the ankle bracelets it should be noted that there * is * a right-wing in the cdu , the so called '' [ berliner kreis ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/berliner_kreis_in_der_union#erkl.c3.a4rung_zur_klimapolitik ) '' ( berlin circle ) . 
  they 've been prominent not too long ago because they openly presented themselves as `` climate sceptics '' , including seeing it as a positive thing because think of all the cool resources that can soon be ice-free !, 
  it 's a bit how you can pretty much call the right-wing of the spd ( [ seeheimer kreis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeheimer_kreis ) ) to be in line with traditionally `` cdu-like '' approaches . 
  just in this case the right-wing of the cdu sounds more like csu or even afd . 
  what should always be mentioned in this context , especially when compared to the us , is that the us system * guarantees * a two party system because there is no alternative to gaining political power . 
  a two party system in return encourages vilifying the other side . 
  the more you invest your own supporters emotionally into your cause the more likely you are to win - and in the end fear of the other side is always easier to create than love for the own side . 
  in contrast , with systems such as the german one political parties are extremely likely to be forced into cooperation since 50 % majorities are the absolute exception . 
  you simply ca n't call your `` enemy '' all kinds of names and then explain how you now have to work with them anyway . 
  also , to my understanding , tighter financial regulations for parties and hence quite a bit less wrestlemania-type events . 
  ________ to throw my personal opinion about an obvious flaw in however that more people should know about we only need to look at what happened in poland in their last election . 
  this type of system in general is vulnerable to a lot of votes going to parties that end up below the thresholds to make it into governments . 
  while the case for poland , as [ another user explained to me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mzzp7/changes_to_judiciary_spark_fresh_concern_in_poland/dk5tvnj/ ) a few days ago , is a bit more unlikely to happen in germany ( mainly due to no 8 % threshold for coalitions and a different mathematical system ) it 's certainly not impossible . 
  note that in the polish example 37 % of the popular vote resulted in 235/460 seats ( 51 % ) while in the last [ german federal election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_2013 ) 41.5 % of the popular vote resulted in 49.2 % of seats by the leading party . 
  all in all we might have to rethink how we handle these thresholds . 
  they 're certainly * needed * because otherwise we might end up like the weimar republic ( or the dutch right now < 3 ) but in times when more people move to vote for smaller parties these safeguards might very well backfire . 
  whereas in the polish example ~ 21 % of votes `` did n't count '' because of these methods the last german federal election had 15.7 % in that category . 
  bit too small difference for my taste to * not * rethink how we 're dealing with this exactly . 
  for all the shit you 're getting in this thread i 'd just like to say that despite your initial question being ` stupid ' i massively respect how you went to `` welp , turns out my view was wrong , tell me more please '' pretty quickly . 
  in my book that massively outweighs the initial ` bad ' question - that 's precisely how one should behave in an ideal world when confronted with that situation . 
  what we * do * know is that there is a significant minority of german turks who do seem to support erdogan and his current plans . 
  however , what we also know is that it 's absolutely unfair to pretend german turks in general share that view without further information . 
  mentioning either of these without the other is usually done to paint a specific ( and not entirely truthful ) picture . 
  notably we also do n't know whether the high abstention rate is a good thing ( because the people consider themselves more german and are less into turkish politics ) or a bad thing ( because the people are politically apathetic and gladly allow a strongman to extend his power ) . 
  it can even be a rather neutral thing because votes were only possible in turkish embassys and it 's quite reasonable to assume quite some people might have had trouble getting there . 
  eh , even if that 's the cause of why he 's trying to spin it this way it 's certainly nothing unique or the only background from which someone argues like this . 
  i 've met cool turks , kurds or germans just as i 've met shitty turks , kurds or germans . 
  in the end we 're all much more alike than we are different , best we can do is call bullshit out when we see it and learn to enjoy our own bullshit being called out . 
  the total is ~ 3.5 million , not 1.5 million . 
  the 13 % figure rolls with 3 million . 
  https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=400000%2f3000000  that means nothing , i mean nothing . 
  because not every turk in germany is eligible to vote , what matters is the ones who are eligible to vote and who they vote . 
  it 's fine if that means nothing to you , they 're still the people who were addressed by gabriel in the statement we 're talking about . 
  of the people he addressed ( `` germany 's turks '' ) 13 % voted `` yes '' in the referendum . 
  i 'm genuinely not sure what 's so hard to understand about that statement . 
  there are roughly 3.5 million people of turkish descent living in germany . 
  those are who gabriel addressed in his statement . 
  ** of those people ** 1.5 million were allowed to vote and 400k aka ~ 13 % of the total voted `` yes '' in the referendum . 
  if gabriel would have directed his statement at people with turkish citizenship in germany or those who voted in the referendum you 'd be correct - but he did n't . 
  again : ** the vast majority of people of turkish descent living in germany did not vote `` yes '' in the referendum . 
  ** neither did they vote `` no '' for obvious reasons and even better : the clear majority ( 2/3rd ) of the people gabriel addressed in his statement were n't even allowed to vote in the referendum in the first place . 
  no , * you * are confused . 
   gabriel penned an open letter , published in german and turkish in the mass circulation newspaper bild , where he called the friendship between germans and the estimated 3 million turks living in the country a `` great treasure . '', 
  we 're talking about * people of turkish descent living in germany * . 
  of those ~ 13 % voted ` yes ' in the referendum . 
  we are ** not ** talking about `` turks in germany who voted in the referendum '' ( ~ 60 % yes ) or `` turks in germany able to vote in the referendum '' ( ~ 30 % yes / ~ 50 % abstention ) . 
  we 're talking about * germany 's turks * here , which includes loads of people who were n't even allowed to vote in the first place . 
  if we take `` germany 's turks '' as gabriel addressed here and add `` those who support erdogan do n't belong here '' then we need to look at the portion of germany 's turks who voted `` yes '' in the referendum : roughly 13 % .
