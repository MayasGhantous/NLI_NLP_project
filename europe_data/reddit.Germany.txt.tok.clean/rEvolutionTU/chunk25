  there are roughly 3.5 million people of turkish descent ( at least one turkish born parent ) living in germany , 1.5 million of which have a turkish pass and ~ 750k who participated in the referendum vote . 
   50 % belong here roughly 13 % of the people of turkish descent ( at least one turkish born parent ) living in germany voted for erdogans referendum . 
  not 50 % . 
  ... which is roughly 13 % of the people of turkish descent ( at least one turkish born parent ) living in germany . 
  * that * in return is roughly the same percentage as that of germans who voted afd at their highest . 
  if `` the turks '' living in germany are equal to erdogan supporters then `` the germans '' living in germany are equal to afd voters . 
  what the interpretation i 'm referring to means is that it is seen as too harsh to be something the germans could tolerate in the long run but too soft to actually prevent germany from rising again . 
  both a softer treaty ( `` peace of honor '' and all that ) or a harsher treaty ( e.g. 
  splitting up germany ) would * probably * have been smarter options . 
   i hope that the majority of polish people can see this for what this is though . 
  i might be too pessimistic here but i do n't think that 's going to happen unless * somehow * the system itself changes drastically from the inside ( are there actual historical examples of this ? ) . 
  not because polish people are susceptible to this but because * humans * are in general . 
  it 's a rhetoric that worked for people on the authoritarian side since at least centuries . 
  it 's akin to the machiavellian ideal that strong extremist forces in a country are great for its leadership since regular citizens will seek protection under their state and gladly give up freedoms for more control that is ultimately not going to make them that much safer . 
  from the us over the uk , germany all the way to poland we 're seeing this mechanism exploited massively since 9/11 , i 'd go as far as saying we still have no idea what damage that single event * actually * caused to western civilization as we know it . 
  some countries like the uk and us have been more ` successful ' here while in germany for example our courts and the eu were able to prevent the worst of it i 'd say . 
  but that general tendency is visible across the entirety of the western world and there is no sign of it stopping any time soon . 
  i do n't think bin laden himself could have imagined how easily we 'll give up some of those values we usually claim to hold in high regard . 
   they were definitely innocent . 
  what are you on about ? 
  they [ attacked germany first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gleiwitz_incident ) , it was mere self defense to strike back !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ case . 
  appropriate hitler quote towards his generals from the 22nd of august , a few days prior :  * i will provide a propagandistic casus belli . 
  its credibility does n't matter . 
  the victor will not be asked whether he told the truth . 
  as a small note it 's really cool to see someone point out the perspective that the treaty of versailles was n't specifically too harsh or too soft but * too much in the middle * which to my understanding is the most accurate modern historical perspective . 
  especially the idea that it was too harsh ( which was what nazi propaganda pushed massively ) seems to be the most mainstream interpretation that people learn about on average but that 's not telling the full story by far . 
   tell me again about how scared volkwagon is of the eu the eu took germany successfully to courts over german legislation that was beneficial to volkswagen and there 's still a class-action lawsuit slowly rolling against the company from at least multiple eu countries . 
   ( i feel like it 's not really scared . 
  its executives are all hiding in europe from criminal charges , after all . ), 
  germany ( just like france , japan or china for example ) does n't extradite its citizens for most crimes unless it 's to another eu state or to the [ icc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_criminal_court ) so that 's a completely different topic and unrelated to the eu . 
  the us specifically did n't want to take part in the icc anymore since 2016 ( along with israel , sudan and russia ) and the extradition treaty between the us and germany to my knowledge has an exception clause for nationals in both directions . 
  what the us * can * do ( and does ) is arrest people they wish to charge if they leave germany and hand out fines against the company . 
  they * could * also file lawsuits against them in germany ( which e.g. 
  norway and other eu nations are doing ) but that 's also nothing the us is interested in to my understanding . 
   maybe not prevent , but imho thresholds should be lower ( 3/5 instead of 5/8 ) , and electoral districts smaller ( e.g. 
  some provinces are made of one district , many just of two ) . 
  yeah that sounds reasonable , a few percentage points can change loads here . 
  i 'd prefer 4 % over here personally . 
  while we 're at it , where is that coalition threshold from in the first place ? 
  do parties need to announce before the election who they 're willing to form a coalition with ? 
  if yes , why ? 
  thanks for breaking that down , i never heard about this before . 
  the length and languages of the wiki articles on this also speaks volume about how well this is known in general . 
  is there actual political will and engagement in the population to change this type of thing or is it more like you have to wait until you somehow get lucky and a governing party pushes something different against their own interest ? 
  that seems like a really difficult spot all in all . 
  agreed . 
  too bad they had a few [ faulty assumptions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #original _ plan ) :  * individual electors would be elected by citizens on a district-by-district basis . 
  * each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting . 
  * candidates would not pair together on the same ticket with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president . 
  * the system as designed would rarely produce a winner , thus sending the election to congress . 
  suddenly you have a system in which the idea is that people more competent than regular citizens vote for the president ( electors/congress ) , the president and vice president can act as checks on each other since they 're not a pre-defined team and the elected leaders are unlikely to have the full support of congress , further taking power away from them . 
  from that perspective things like the president & congress appointing scotus judges with simple majorities are not a big deal at all . 
  checks and balances everywhere . 
  the original design was pretty damn decent from a historical point of view i must say . 
  hmmm ... over here we replaced that with [ hare-niemayer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/largest_remainder_method ) which gives larger parties a smaller advantage in 1987 , i 'm not sure if there 's actually a good list somewhere about which country uses what since when . 
  in 2005 we changed to the [ sainte-lagu\u00eb method ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/webster/sainte-lagu%c3%ab_method ) which seems to produce similar results and also seems to be widely spread . 
  poland used that in 2001 apparently !, 
  ______ in terms of threshold i think that 's a genuinely hard topic overall . 
  if it 's too high you prevent new parties and/or can potentially cause lots of lost votes , if it does n't exist you end up with something like the [ current dutch election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_general_election,_2017#results ) . 
  that kind of approach played a role in how functional governments could not be formed during the weimar republic so threshold in general * do * have certain merits i 'd say and are worth keeping around unless we come up with something better . 
  personally i 'd like a system where if my preferred party does n't cross the threshold my vote just changes to my second preferred alternative and so on . 
  you 're talking to an * individual * not the * personified majority of the country * . 
  have some respect , does n't matter if it 's turks opposing erdogan or poles opposing pis . 
  if you share their viewpoints then celebrate them and cooperate with them but do n't run around condemning people you * technically * agree with because `` but the majority in your country did something bad '' . 
   * parties below 5 % support do not enter sejm  * coalition of parties starting together below 8 % do not enter sejm ohhh , so that is why zl did n't get a seat at all despite getting 7.5 % of the votes ? 
  that makes a lot more sense . 
  that alone would have prevented a majority for pis if i understand the process correctly . 
   lucky distribution of votes gave pis enough support to have over a half of sejm . 
  this has happened for the first time in 28 years . 
  untill now the coalition of parties ruled in poland . 
  never single party . 
  yeah , it does seem a bit like a freak accident . 
  i 'm not even sure if there 's anything reasonable on a systemic level that can be changed to prevent such a scenario . 
  i think we 're running into the same issue over here if the amount of votes for parties that end up below 5 % becomes too high , the record in our last election ( 15.7 % ) lead to the leading party getting 49 % of seats with 41.5 % of the votes . 
  in comparison we 're talking about ~ 21 % of the votes that `` did n't make it '' in yours . 
  hard topic really , i doubt there are changes that would even make sense to prevent this scenario unless you end up doing the dutch thing ( plsno ) . 
  e :  the opposition loves to say that current government has `` only '' 19 % of support ( as the recent elections had slightly more than 50 % frequence ) . 
  hovewer they shut up when you point them out that they have only about 12 % counted with the same method  to be fair that turnout * is * abysmal . 
  neither side should really celebrate that . 
  democracy is kinda pointless if the people do n't want to participate in it , but it 's also on the state to encourage that participation . 
  yeah , i definitely see where you 're coming from . 
  it 's mostly that i disagree with the notion that referendums with a simple majority are a good tool when it comes to such major decisions when they 're only used so rarely . 
   i would say that leaving the eu without having a referendum would have been a much bigger break with tradition . 
  that 's a good point . 
  from the other direction no one would have taken a 52:48 in favor of staying as `` look , the uk population spoke and the will of the people is clear on this issue , we can stop talking about it now '' because it 's just too thin to say that . 
   it 's not really comparable to switzerland as they make day-to-day policy decisions through referendums which i would not classify leaving the eu as . 
  they do the same for federal issues [ including their constitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_initiative_ ( switzerland \\ ) #federal _ popular_initiative ) with double majorities needed to enact the change in those cases . 
  since this might be the right place to ask , please help me understand why poland works like it does here a bit better . 
  in the [ 2016 election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliamentary_election,_2015#results ) pis got 37 % of the popular vote . 
  that translated to 235/460 seats in the sejm which makes it look like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliament_of_poland#/media/file:pol_sejm_rp_seats_2015.svg ) and 61/100 seats in the senate which made it look like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliament_of_poland#/media/file:senate_of_poland_composition.svg ) . 
  notably if we look at the picture of the sejm specifically , the blue + orange blocks combined stand for 61 % of the popular vote that got 373/460 aka 81 % of the seats . 
  the wiki article says the sejm is based on proportional representation with the senate being based on first-past-the-post . 
  but then going from 37 % to simple majorities in * both houses of parliament * sounds super weird . 
  hell , the senate is * almost * at a 2/3rd majority for pis . 
  i feel like i 'm missing something major here to understand why it the parliamentary distribution looks like it does and can now push for such sweeping changes in the first place . 
  i mean it in the way that the public in countries like the uk or germany is n't used to referendums like that which means they 'll be less educated and overall make most likely less quality decision against their own interests than for example a swiss person who is used to their entire political landscape being built around direct democracy . 
  with regards to history in the uk before 1997 there have been * four * referendums total . 
  this quote [ from wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_in_the_united_kingdom ) is kinda cool in this regard :  in may 1945 the then prime minister winston churchill suggested holding a referendum over the question of extending the life of his wartime coalition until victory was won over japan , be allowed to continue in office . 
  however , clement attlee refused citing ` i could not consent to the introduction into our national life of a device so alien to all our traditions as the referendum which has only too often been the instrument of nazism and fascism . ' implying that referendums were a totally unknown and alien device to british politics .
