  in march 1975 margaret thatcher also quoted clement attlee that referendums are `` a device of dictators and demagogues '' as napoleon , mussolini and hitler had exploited their use in the past . 
  throughout the entire history of the uk we only have * three * nationwide referendums . 
  1975 ( eec membership ) , 2011 [ alternative vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum,_2011 ) , and now brexit in 2016 . 
  to me this hardly counts as a nation where we can count on the population to use this kind of instrument in a way that actually makes sense . 
  even completely leaving the topic of brexit itself out of the picture i 'd be pretty apprehensive about votes of similar proportion being left up to the population and then just rolling with a 48:52 result - whether that 's in the uk , germany or any other country with a similar relationship to referendums . 
  the obvious comparison here is , again , [ switzerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/direct_democracy#switzerland ) . 
  those guys passing a referendum with similar weight is a completely different league from my point of view since it 's such an inherent part of their democracy . 
  if you can find a poll that confirms germans consider the us their enemy then feel free to link it , i 'm not aware of something like that . 
  you * do * realize the us is held to a completely different standard regarding their actions in the world than russia , right ? 
  i think that 's a great case that shows that the eu * is * harsher than other governmental bodies and why that 's a good thing . 
  if a german company/the german government pulls crap like this the eu can take a stand . 
  sure , in theory this simply pushes the level at which corruption has to occur one level higher but in practice i 'd argue this gives regular citizen and consumers a more even playing field * even if * their governments work against that interest . 
  if the swiss would do this kind of thing when their entire political landscape is built around it then i do n't mind it at all . 
  if a country like germany or the uk ( or basically * anyone * who is n't swiss ) that do n't have a history of these things do the same thing i 'm highly skeptical . 
  man , imagine for a second that every major decision in a nation like that is just solved by popular opinion . 
  \\* shudder \\*, 
   i do n't dislike rosling , i respected him ; however , his presentations were doing harm by spreading false optimism about the global demographic situation -- a notion that we just need to keep business as usual and the population will peak , piece of cake . 
  hmmm ... the way i understood most of his talks were that that 's indeed the case - but ** only ** in terms of population growth . 
  whether those are sustainable , how they can be sustainable and similar questions to me are different ones . 
  we need to understand how quickly population growth was `` fixed '' in countries like bangladesh to think about it rationally and move away from `` but their culture is popping out kids !! '', 
  or similar crap , for me he does an amazing job there . 
   yes , 1.5 billion was ill-advised , i take it back ( it 's insane how much the african population grew since i last checked ) . 
  phew , i did get triggered a bit by what sounded like good old * final solutions * i must admit . 
  all good . 
  the chinese approach * would * probably be best overall but it 's also something i do n't see the eu or the us openly supporting . 
  population control measures based on outside policies sounds like a recipe for disaster . 
  what could be done is incentivizing smaller families but that needs both massive medical and educational investment * yesterday * but also , as you said , functioning governments that are backed by the population . 
  regulating the mess that is electronic or textile ` waste ' that we 're dumping on that continent is also something that needs to be done but that would require international cooperation and companies that get smacked around . 
  that 's probably something where i 'd like the eu to take a stand the most . 
  apart from that macrons statement in context was completely fine from my point of view and that 's where part of the outrage comes from . 
  the full quote and his previous statements on these similar issues paint a much more nuanced picture . 
  ______ all in all the biggest mistake of `` the west '' in my opinion are all these half-assed measures since decades . 
  medical help because `` think of the children '' without allowing more access to education or infrastructure , clothing donations that i was raised with as a good thing for africa and capitalist interests all across the board that no one * really * cares about because it 's not close to home . 
  * either * you move in with massive developmental help to get them to a first-world status asap or you leave it alone and let it go the same path other nations did . 
  cherrypicking between those because of conscience and capitalism hurt that area ( and all of us in the future ) massively in retrospect . 
  things like this make me rather glad that all in all germany is decent when it comes to preventing monopolies . 
  keeping the various companies in permanent competition drives prices down and quality up . 
  repeat that for a few decades and it turns out pretty well . 
  all in all i 'd say our discounters have high standards of quality albeit sometimes questionable standards of ethics ( lidl comes to mind specifically ) . 
  you got ta keep in mind how insanely popular these things are in germany and [ what kind of companies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edeka ) are [ behind them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aldi ) . 
  there was and is massive competition between discounters in germany and that shows both in price and quality . 
  that 'd be fine if they were a ) actually cheaper and b ) * clearly fucking marked * . 
  paint flags over it for all i care but it 's pretty clear to me that the goal is to use the association with the german version of the product to scam people out of money . 
  i mean he * is * right . 
  the topics of a unified military and an effort like this are completely different from each other and we do n't need `` but the eu elites ... ! '', 
  talk to understand that . 
  it should be noted that we 've known that operation sophia is a complete failure since may 2016 so this is n't * really * news . 
  a big part of the issue is that these missions ( just like the more successful operation triton ) are completely voluntary projects that not all eu members are on board with . 
  all these projects are * massively * underfunded from my understanding ( triton with 2.9 mil $ / month and sophia with less than 1mil $ / month ) and all in all nations seem reluctant to actually invest into them properly . 
  _________ apart from that to assess whether the effort is effective in arresting smugglers at sea we 'd have to know how many there are which we do n't to my knowledge . 
   the operation 's figures show 110 suspected smugglers and traffickers have been apprehended and 463 boats prevented from being re-used since it started . 
  if i understand things right the issue is that after removing the ` reasonable ' boats and arresting smugglers at sea they 're now putting people in barely functioning boats and send them in roughly the right direction . 
  it 's * kind of * hard to arrest people for that on foreign territory . 
  main goal should be to stabilize nations on the other side so there 's an actual authority to work with . 
   sigh . 
  china 's trust rating went up by 14 points lmao . 
  why ? 
  to me as a layman that 's probably best explained by the fact that china made it into the news more often here lately as our next best possible option . 
  fact is that talk by the us about tariffs on german exports or the general animosity at times makes people uneasy , albeit just slightly . 
  china is to my knowledge our next best market and one that * could * turn out more reliable if these kinds of talks are followed up with action . 
  it should be noted that [ china has been strong importer of german goods ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/deu/show/all/2015/ ) since years ( amazing site by the way , clicking around there is pretty cool ) and became our biggest trading partner overall [ in 2017 ] ( http://fortune.com/2017/02/24/china-germany-us-france-trade/ ) . 
  the more isolationist/protectionist the us acts , the more public opinion will sway to someone like china instead . 
  what usually really gets me is when i realize the eu has a population of 500 million people , the us has 320 million but then china and india both have 1.3 billion people * each * . 
  chinas growth in terms of population size pretty much stopped , they 're estimated to hit 1.4 billion until 2030 . 
  india slowed down a little less and is expected to hit 1.5 billion until then . 
  all * really * good reasons to play nice with that side of the globe , if nothing else then at least from a practical point of view . 
   first of all , if anyone points me to another hans rosling video , i swear i am going to kill someone . 
  he was an extreme optimist who , as i said , always operated on the false notion that `` there is plenty of resources to fuel further growth of consumption '' . 
  that is not true . 
  human resource consumption levels must decrease significantly or we 're screwed good , globally . 
  the portion i just referred you to with the estimate of a peak of 11 billion is in line with all major projections . 
  it 's fine to dislike him as a person for whatever reason but that does n't make that point for example any less true . 
  as for the rest of your post , of course they are n't interested in environmental standards . 
  that 's part of the point of * being less developed * . 
  there 's no room for that kind of stuff when you 're busy covering basic human needs . 
   therefore , the first order of business must be to bring down birth rates , to reduce this destructive demographic pressure in the developing countries and allowing them to focus , with the help of developed countries , on lifting themselves out of poverty and doing so sustainably , without repeating the worst mistakes of the european or chinese industrialisation story . 
  well , yes . 
  that 's being done by ensuring they can be more prosperous , by help in terms of education and medical advances . 
  not by dumping our useless clothing or electronic waste on them which stops local industries and * prevents * development . 
  again , we 're talking about literally the same process that brought countries like bangladesh to lower birthrates . 
  these things go * extremely * fast under the right conditions - in the case of bangladesh we 're talking about 7 children per women in 1972 all the way to 2.1 in 2015 . 
  lowering birth rates , by definition , comes with more short-term population growth . 
  the prosperity that causes people to invest more heavily in less children causes people to live longer at the same time . 
   really , there is no argument whatsoever that would support the notion that an africa with 3 + billion people would have better chances to develop non-catastrophically than an africa with ~ 1.5 billion people . 
  africa * right now * is at 1.2 billion and is expected to hit 2.5 in 2050 - the idea of somehow keeping the population at your proposed 1.5 billion is * literally * impossible without randomly killing off people . 
  what you need to understand is that while arguing for help by developed nations and lower birth rates that come with higher standards of living is a reasonable position that i share it is also at complete odds with throwing around a number like 1.5 billion that 's impossible to achieve with these methods . 
  feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong here but in the case of israel [ it sounds like ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/israel-has-the-highest-birth-rate-in-the-developed-world-and-thats-becoming-a-problem-2015-9?ir=t ) we 're looking at an ideology/culture and/or outside pressure that encourages high birth rates . 
  to my knowledge that 's an absolute exception , but it 's good to know nevertheless . 
  [ long term ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.tfrt.in?locations=il-1w-bd ) it looks like that trend was artificially stopped , what changed in 1992 that causes birth rates to spike up again ? 
   while it 's likely that a richer africa will also be one with a slower growth in population it 's very likely that uninhibited population booms will continue for a generation or two regardless of the levels of prosperity . 
  i mean , that 's how it works out in practice . 
  bangladesh is now at 2.14 children per women but will keep growing in population size until the previous generation dies off since they 're already profiting from increased lifespans that come with this prosperity . 
  after that one generation there 's not much shifting around usually . 
  first of all human population growth is expected to peak around 2070 according to most models . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/projections_of_population_growth#world_population_in_2050 ) is a reasonable start . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1154 ) the topic explained in a video format . 
  now for the second part :  africa must be prevented from continuing on the present-day u.n. estimated demographic trajectory , or it is screwed and the domino effect will eventually take the rest of the world with it . 
  so you 're saying an 11-fold increase is fine but your arbitrary 20-fold increase is n't ? 
  the solution to that is to either exterminate humans who are n't living in first world conditions already because we must stop them from consuming as much as we already do or to * learn how to deal with it * . 
  _______ our ways of consumption that rely on finite resources have ** never ** been sustainable .
