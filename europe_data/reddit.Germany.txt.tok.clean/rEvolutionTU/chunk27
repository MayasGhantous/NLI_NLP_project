  the world , including our glorious first-world nations ** will ** go down the drain no matter what if we ca n't figure out solutions to these issues . 
  we 're entirely on borrowed time and that 's our own fault , not that of people in other parts of the globe who * literally * want the same as we do in this regard . 
  our absolute best bet is to help other nations make the transition as quickly as possible in the hope that * one * of the by then 11 billion human beings can come up with a solution for everyone . 
  the alternative is fighting over scraps until humanity is genuinely done and it will take a few million years until something similar hopefully comes up with a better plan from the start . 
   as nigeria is likely to continue to grow at a fast pace , shit is gon na hit the fan once they hit bangladeshi levels of density . 
  too many people on one spot . 
  if today 's situation is unsustainable already , i dare not think about what comes next . 
  i do n't think that 's a good way to look at it . 
  yes , i 'm about to leave usable land out of this but let 's take a look at a few nations : * united states : 33 people per km \u00b2 * china : 144 people per km \u00b2 * germany : 229 people per km \u00b2 * netherlands : 414 people per km \u00b2 * nigeria : 167 people per km \u00b2 * bangladesh : 964 people per km \u00b2 * india : 368 people per km \u00b2 * singapore : 7,148 people per km \u00b2 * south korea : 487 people per km \u00b2 [ source ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_density ) . 
  i think [ this map ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/the-worlds-least-densely-populated-countries/ ) has a bit more modern data , but the overall point i 'd make is that there is massive diversity in that list overall . 
  yes , bangladesh is an outlier but all in all the factor 2 between germany and the netherlands or the factor 15 between the us and south korea does n't matter * that * much in practice - all those areas have , on average , a very high standard of living . 
  ________ what we as members of the western world should come to terms with on an international scale is that we 're a minority and have been one since quite a while . 
  if every person on the planet would have equal rights and we 'd elect a leader tomorrow it would * probably * not be the one we 'd favor on average if our interests do n't align with everyone else . 
  that alone should be a reason to actually start being a bit nicer to those who are the majority but behind in terms of development . 
  we 're prominent on the international level because of our technological advantage first and foremost , it 's up to us that if other nations catch up to that level that they 're looking up to us and want to cooperate because we lead by example , not that they remember us as those who gladly exploited them for decades or sometimes centuries . 
  it 's in parts up to us that all these nations `` grow up '' with somewhat similar basic values as ours , because if they end up differing massively we 're all going to suffer . 
  * that * is the scenario that scares me personally . 
  yeah , that sounds overall pretty sensible . 
  i think as long as you 're willing to be more relaxed on `` recognized by more than 50 % of the council of europe members '' and the iso 3166 code in the long run once the majority is cleaned up i doubt people will have issues with this . 
  the alternative is a highly political choice ( `` council does n't recognize palestine so you ca n't show other users you 're from there '' ) and might curb lots of regions that share common cultures , dialects or even languages without being ` official ' regions on a primary administrative level . 
  it 'd be a shame to lose that kind of diversity that 's sometimes cool to see . 
  either way , if there 's any way regular users can help out feel free to let me know , the process sounds too involved to complain but then to leave you alone with all the work . 
   germans consider the us to be their enemy could you link me a source for that claim ? 
   but why do they need us to solve them ? 
  because some of them are still an issue because of western international pressure . 
  the [ clothing industry ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-african-countries-dont-want-your-used-clothing-anymore_us_57cf19bce4b06a74c9f10dd6 ) is a prime example . 
  the textile industry is something amazing for developing countries since you can create wealth and products with relatively little effort . 
  since decades western nations undermined that process by either donations or dumping our unwanted stuff for way cheaper than what it would cost to produce it locally . 
  in march 2016 the governments of the east african community , which includes kenya , tanzania , uganda , rwanda , and burundi [ proposed a ban on imports of secondhand clothes  ( http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/waste_not/kelsey_halling/not_so_fast_fashion_african_countries_ban_secondhand_clothin )  it seems unlikely that the ban will actually become law , but the very fact that it exists is fascinating on several levels . 
  once again , we see unintended consequences of well-meaning foreign aid . 
  in uganda , for example , it is estimated that secondhand garments make up 81 percent of all clothing purchases - leaving little market share for locally produced apparel . 
  kenya had a clothing industry that at its height employed 500,000 people , and today only sustains roughly 20,000 jobs . 
  even if enacted , the ban wo n't necessarily spur local apparel production ; the ban does not include inexpensive new clothing , which could be easily imported by traders from asia . 
  hence no industry develops , people do n't get these kind of jobs , stay poor , need more kids . 
  what is needed is * medical * and * educational * help while these kinds of scenarios where our policies are actively harmful need to be addressed . 
  [ e-waste ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/tomorrow/electronic-waste-in-africa-recycling-methods-damage-health-and-the-environment-a-1086221.html ) is a similar topic . 
  they need * us * to solve these problems because * we * accept and encourage them . 
  i 'm genuinely surprised you 're even getting upvotes for trying to use that kind of blog as ` evidence ' for what you 're trying to say . 
  let 's look at some glorious quotes : [ 1 ] ( https://occamsrazormag.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/the-left-wants-to-use-christianity-to-crush-white-identity/ ) :  the left wants to use christianity to police the alt-right  updates :  cross-posted at altright.com . 
  [ 2 ] ( https://occamsrazormag.wordpress.com/2014/07/07/what-is-new-creationism/ ) :  what is new creationism ? 
   new creationism can be thought of as the anti-darwinian religion of many of the far left . 
  [ 3 ] ( https://occamsrazormag.wordpress.com/2017/01/28/is-contemporary-christianity-a-suicide-cult/ ) :  is contemporary christianity a suicide cult ? 
   what i mean here is mainstream christianity in the united states and europe , not non-western christianity such as the rise of black or mestizo christianity that one finds in the global south nor the small pockets of uncucked christianity one might find . 
  the christianity i 'm referencing here is mainstream and practiced almost exclusively by white people : we 'll call it cucked christianity . 
   as i and many others have noted , this cucked christianity is fast becoming a suicide cult . 
  i do n't even know what to say . 
  if ** that ** is what you come up with when pressed for actual real world evidence then that speaks volumes for what you 're * actually * trying to say . 
  but sure :  again , i wish i was just being bigoted and you are right , but you unfortunately , just like more of your racism-yelling peers seem unable to back up your statement with any scientific evidence , but prefer to back it up with emotionally laden insults instead . 
  you 're citing information from a * literal * propaganda outlet by some random individual and accuse others of being `` racism-yelling '' and unable to back statements up with scientific evidence . 
  well done . 
   bangladesh is even worse . 
  from a development perspective bangladesh is * better * , not worse - they 're at 2.14 kids born per woman . 
  in practice that means their population size will keep growing for roughly one generation and that 's their peak . 
  meanwhile nigeria is at 5.65 kids born per woman which reflects how much further behind they are . 
  there 's no reason to complicate this topic since it 's * literally * as simple as prosperity causing birth rates to drop . 
   so the reason has to be at least partly cultural . 
  ...  his point was essentially to say that africa has to change to attract private investors and not count too much on foreign help since it ca n't be too efficient in countries that grow so much and find employment for its own population . 
  meanwhile western policies are actively undermining employment in these regions . 
  help is needed in terms of education and medical availability , not in terms of dumping low-tech industry products like shoes or clothing that they * could * manufacture themselves if this was n't a thing . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-african-countries-dont-want-your-used-clothing-anymore_us_57cf19bce4b06a74c9f10dd6 ) is a reasonable article that sums the issue up with regards to the clothing industry specifically . 
  prosperity = few children , poverty = many children . 
  what makes you believe that for * some * reason for africa specifically this wo n't happen due to `` their culture '' when this basic correlation is true from europe over bangladesh to china , the latter who exploited this correlation to become prosperous more quickly ? 
  mandatory [ hans rosling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=538 ) mention . 
  you want to address their ridiculously high birth rates ? 
  help them help themselves . 
  once a country develops enough that their lifespans increase the amount of children per woman drops dramatically . 
  countries like bangladesh are at 2.5 children already and most people do n't even realize that 's the case . 
  also things like the western world using africa as a massive dump for clothing and similar donations need to stop , that ended up hurting their development way more than anyone anticipated . 
  to be fair there * is * a chance that the yougov poll is more accurate and may/the uk as a whole dropped in public perception since the election . 
  we 'll know in a month or two when our next polls should pop up . 
  either way , this should be seen as a short-term perspective and needs to be understood in that context so i would n't give it too much thought apart from some kind of `` huh , that 's interesting '' - the independent pretending that if germans see may and putin as equally bad means that we think they 're * literally * on the same level is completely over the top as well . 
  the standard for putin overall is just much lower compared to both trump and may . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/deutschlandtrend-541~_v-videowebl.jpg ) is what it looked like in july 2016 in comparison by the way . 
  personally i have to admit i 'm definitely less sure what to think exactly about the uk politically . 
  the election result * seems * more reasonable than expected but then may seems to be more and more drifting towards the us and does n't exactly come across as strong or stable . 
  german sinti & roma specifically are one of the [ four recognized national minorities in germany ] ( http://www.bmi.bund.de/en/topics/society-constitution/national-minorities/national_minorities_node.html ) . 
   four officially recognized national minorities live in germany : the danes , the frisians , the german sinti and roma , and the sorbs . 
  ...  they differ from the majority population in having their own language , culture and history and thus their own distinct identity ; the frisian flag is another one that will get the axe with this change . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  not a fan of condensing identities down like this at all . 
  higher up there 's an [ east frisian guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mkjzb/user_flair_flags_reorganization/dk2c4rj/ ) whose flair will get the axe . 
  =(  come to think of it , we had a female bundeskanzler before we had a bavarian one !, 
  just the thought of a bavarian chancellor being technically * possible * at some point in the future makes me shudder unless through some miracle bavarian politics end up changing . 
  plsno . 
  from my point of view : i do n't understand [ your dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5litqtk28l8 ) at all . 
  that 's enough in my book to qualify it as a specific culture within germany that 's cool to see represented like this . 
   having less user flair selections , so that it 's easier to find your own flag ( with 350 flairs , it 's way too difficult ) i just realized the list is ordered alphabetically , can that be changed somehow ? 
  worst case with a space in front or some similar trickery ? 
  that would allow you to put first tier ( nations ) first , second tier ( first level admin ) second and more specific exceptions later down the list . 
  people could then scroll for something more unique but you would still have easy choices for new users for example . 
   having unified rules for what flairs are supposed to be included . 
  all i can do here is give the feedback that i think that 's an overall illogical and too much of a top-down decision . 
  the idea of a system like this , to me and presumably most users , is to express cultural or geographical affiliation - to represent * which community one belongs to * . 
  while for the most part these things * can * be fit into simple rules there are exceptions all across the board in all kinds of nations . 
  europe and the european project is an amazing feat that celebrates diversity and i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea to curb that because : '' * but the culture you identify with is n't officially a first level administrative region !, 
  * '' i 've seen users so far make great cases for lisbon , catalonia ( ind ) , corsica , qu\u00e9bec or even my good old franconia . 
  taking palestine away would be similar even though it would affect less people in here most likely . 
  my personal suggestion would be to still go at the first level administrations since removing duplicates alone is reason enough but then to also make room for quite a few exceptions if people end up asking for it . 
  _______ as a sidenote the vexillology version someone referred to in [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mkjzb/user_flair_flags_reorganization/dk2htgj/?context=3 ) would alleviate all of my complaints and apprehensions so far . 
  could also make your life a * lot * easier , assuming you find a way to sort these things .
