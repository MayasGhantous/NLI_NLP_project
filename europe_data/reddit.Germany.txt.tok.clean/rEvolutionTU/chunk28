  in order of cultural affiliation on a national scale or lower i 'd consider myself german first , franconian second and bavarian pretty damn far down the list . 
  basically while i like using the german flair since it 's overall the one i 'd consider the most accurate to understand where my posts are coming from * if * i wanted to use a regional one bavaria is not an option . 
  from an international perspective recognizing palestine should n't [ even be a discussion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_the_state_of_palestine ) - the eu majority stance is a clear minority overall . 
  i mean sure , * technically * if we want to make / r/europe representative of the values of specific european countries and assume that that 's our reality then fine , kick it out . 
  i personally see flairs more as something that allows users to express their geographical and cultural background easily , from that point of view removing something like that is a weird choice . 
  it 's also a specifically * political * choice and i 'm not sure if that 's a good thing . 
  that list is actually really cool . 
  could kick out the non-national non-european flags and roll with that from my point of view . 
  one * could * make the first choices on the list ( countries ) really simple and then go deeper with that kind of list in case people want to express something more specific . 
   it 's absurd to have flags of ceuta and melilla but not of europe 's 11th largest urban area ; for reference since i had to google those two : [ ceuta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceuta ) : 82,376 people . 
  [ melilla ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melilla ) : 78,476 people . 
  [ lisbon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbon ) : 2.7 million people . 
  to me the point of these flairs is n't to be vexicologically or geographically accurate , it 's to allow users to choose a banner under which their opinions and perspectives can be seen and better understood from a foreign perspective . 
  i would * like * to see both a catalonia ( ind ) and a catalonia ( spain ) flair when the topic is discussed since it allows one to put the varying viewpoints together . 
  on top of that the [ iso 3166 standard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2 ) is rather messy and not standardized across countries . 
  hell , part of regional cultural identities is that they 're ** not ** officially recognized and hence would not show up in these kinds of lists in the first place . 
  i 'd rather these flairs represent the banners users would * like * to be seen under rather than the geographical and political reality that they 're being forced under . 
  there 's also the elephant in the room that flairs make the sub open to easy ( and potentially very specific ) brigading but i 'm not sure if that 's a topic that can even be resolved in the first place . 
  i have to admit the change overall does seem a bit counterproductive as of now . 
  after all the practical purpose of these flags is n't to be absolutely accurate but to reflect the identity of the user , feel free to correct me if that assumption is wrong . 
  going through the [ iso_3166-2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2 ) - codes on wiki they * massively * differ from country to country . 
  some ( like germany ) have very few while others like the uk for example have dozens for every possible area . 
  * personally * i 'd rather see both catalonia ( ind ) and catalonia ( spain ) or both bavaria and franconia since they 're representing overall different cultural identities or even political convictions . 
  hell , both a german and an east german flair are also something i 'd consider cool . 
  sure that differentiation is officially gone since 30 years but i do think people should be able to openly identify themselves with this * region * from a cultural perspective . 
  otherwise we might as well scrap all regional flairs and stick to country flags only . 
  to look at actual numbers franconia for example has 4 million people while bavaria in total is at 12 million people . 
  i highly doubt this is the only scenario like this popping up but to me that 's a clear example where ` simplifying ' seems to remove in parts what makes these flairs cool in the first place . 
  edited . 
  i was partially shitposting though because it sounds like the glorious [ franconian flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franconia ) is getting removed in favor of the oppressive bavarian one . 
  what a shame . 
  that 's just mean . 
   the fact that bavaria has two flags you mean [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hsn2jlc.png ) and [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/flagge_franken.svg/2000px-flagge_franken.svg.png ) , right ? 
  i 'm not sure * why * but i ca n't find any recent german numbers on putin as a person . 
  the most recent ones i can find are [ this graphic ] ( http://www.bpb.de/cache/images/3/171093-3x2-galerie.jpg?4f9e7 ) for 2008-2013 ( green/left side = positive ) and then [ this ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/219757/umfrage/umfrage-zum-vetrauen-in-wladimir-putin/ ) bit from july 2016 that puts him at 13 % trust / 81 % distrust . 
  erdogan is also difficult , there are some polls about specific things but not him overall as a person that i can find . 
  maybe some other german reading this can help you out there . 
  it * could * be that it 's not considered massively important from a german perspective or , more likely , that it 's close enough to the opinion of their respective countries nowadays so it 's not in the pretty infographics but a bit hidden somewhere in the sources . 
  from my personal perspective for example i can see myself giving different answers to the uk/may or us/trump but for putin/russia or erdogan/turkey they 're pretty much the same . 
  all in all i 'd take yougov with a grain of salt and/or assume it 's an accurate reflection of * current * german public opinion in context . 
  as you see in the us graphs for example our polling questions are usually aimed to get a short-term perspective . 
  when people say that may and putin are unpopular with them they apply completely different standards to them - for may for example some election quotes and the dup coalition sound like things germans traditionally do n't appreciate . 
  i assume you said this in jest but it should be noted that in germany under the banner of [ `` anti-antifa '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-antifa ) you 'll basically find some of the most militant right-wingers around . 
  this includes but is not limited to shoving dead animals in peoples mailboxes , throwing molotovs at buildings or murder . 
  internationally members have been associated with [ blood and honour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blood_%26_honour ) , [ combat 18 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combat_18 ) and similar groups . 
  we 're * literally * talking about right-wing terrorism here . 
   they 're on the fringe and will never see their ideas in any kind of public office again . 
  we saw what communism was like and no european country will ever go back to it . 
  from a german perspective that 's no reason to tolerate such behavior or propaganda associated with it as a society . 
  nsu , raf , right - , left-extremists . 
  there 's not much difference when both share the interest of wanting the current political system to go up in flames . 
  see [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mkd45/theresa_may_now_as_unpopular_in_germany_as/dk2bxc3/ ) post for a perspective on german public opinion from june that 's not from yougov . 
  this is n't the be all and end all of polling either but no one should really base their opinion on * one * poll without any historical context or other sources . 
  to be fair that overall german perspective is also not exactly news . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie25_03_cd42747570.png ) is a longer trend towards the usa . 
  it 's only ` news ' because it recovered a bit around april to ~ 30 % who had a more positive view of the us as a reliable partner . 
  the most recent drama around russia brought it back down to the current level . 
  does someone have a link to the actual poll ? 
  i 'm failing to find it . 
  notably the results claimed here go against the most recent [ deutschlandtrend ] ( https://www.infratest-dimap.de/umfragen-analysen/bundesweit/ard-deutschlandtrend/2017/juni/ ) from june . 
  odds are either opinion regarding may changed quite a bit in the last month or one of the polls was off by a bit . 
  the election stories & especially the dup coalition * could * have had that effect and there is no data with regards to putin specifically . 
  it should allow for a bit more nuanced perspective either way . 
  ** satisfaction with foreign politicians : ** macron : 59 % satisfied/very satisfied , 9 % less/not at all satisfied , 28 % no comment may : 22 % satisfied , 59 % less/not at all satisfied , 16 % no comment trump : 5 % satisfied/very satisfied , 92 % less/not at all satisfied , 2 % no comment ** trustworthy partners , trend compared to april : ** france 94 % ( +3 ) uk : 60 % ( +3 ) russia 21 % ( +1 ) usa : 21 % ( -8 ) china : 36 % ( +14 ) turkey : 3 % ( + -0 ) ____ e : just as a sidenote since it will probably come up [ here ] ( https://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie25_03_cd42747570.png ) is a longer trend towards the us , these polls always need to be seen as a very short term snapshot of public perception . 
  the trend towards the us since trump recovered a bit to 29 % in april and is now back on previous level , most likely due to the more recent russian stories . 
  [ hans rosling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=538 ) has your back . 
  the entire documentary is well worth watching but that portion perfectly illustrates your point . 
  right after that segment he goes into how well we 're educated about these topics and how many preconceived notions we have in this area . 
  tl ; dr : it 's bad . 
  it might surprise you but people during different times consider different choices the smart/correct ones . 
  from * todays * perspective yes , sure - the nations involved could have done some things differently which might have led to an overall ` better ' outcome . 
  but that 's based on what we learned from their mistakes and an overall better understanding of the entire picture . 
  actively judging them for not doing those things as if they had a genuine informed choice in the matter is out of line however . 
   it 's also said that many people even start to adore the sight of a perfectly shaped and coloured turd because its a sign of good health . 
  g l \u00fc c k s w u r s t . 
  give it a few more decades and you 'll be told that it 's okay to hate greenpeace now and that there is no reason to be held back by your past .

  at 00:45 there 's even the glorious stop sign in the graphic that shows how the radioactive clouds could n't move past the german border . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.europa.clio-online.de/essay/id/artikel-3766 ) a link to the initial ( german ) article that made me stumble upon this in the first place . 
   statistics are not racist that 's not necessarily true in practice since the numbers depend upon reliable sources which might be massively biased without it being obvious from the stats themselves at all . 
  that 's why profiling , even subconsciously , is so massively dangerous to statistics , even if it seems successful at a glance . 
  a simple example would be a scenario where 20 % of your population have skincolor a and 80 % skincolor b , with the people of color a being more likely to be in prison for carrying a certain illegal item with them . 
  let 's assume just for fun that in reality they 're both equally likely to carry said item with them . 
  maybe 10 % of people do this . 
  we now have a police control where we check 10x a and 10x b from a group of 100 random people and put those behind bars who carried the item with them . 
  ________ -- newsflash -- : people of color a are four times more likely to be in prison for carrying illegal item with them . 
  1/20 of them are in prison for this crime compared to only 1/80 for people of color b. 
  ... and since we just `` confirmed '' that they 're more likely to carry what we 're looking for with simple numbers we simply * have * to check these guys more often . 
  ________ the * proper * way to look at this scenario would have been to look at how many of each group that we checked for our item actually carried it with them , there we pretty much instantly arrive at the ( correct ) value of 10 % for both groups . 
  but that 's something you wo n't see in ` final ' numbers that show convictions . 
  even small and completely unintentional biases add up quickly in these scenarios . 
  if for example the population on average is more likely to involve authorities for one skincolor but not the other ( since after all everyone knows they 're more often convicted so it 's not racist at all to do this and just based on facts and reality ! ), 
  then congratulations : we just skewed the entire thing substantially . 
  it 's usually not explained like this from what i 've seen but * that * is the type of institutionalized or internalized racism we all should care about . 
  '' * in lodernde feuerhaufen werfen * '' is what he said here , `` throwing them onto the burning pile '' basically . 
  what the guy commentating is saying is that * on top * of the autonomist groups overall there 's also youth groups that simply like causing chaos in general which he calls responsible for that area specifically . 
  * especially * since hamburg has a rather ` involved ' left scene they know what they usually do and what they 're capable off - and he 's saying that throwing molotovs at an ikea is n't part of their usual program and hence rather unlikely that it 's coming from locals . 
  _________ that 's part of why i 'm overall very skeptical of all the `` leftwingers !! '', 
  or `` antifa = anarchists '' stuff that 's being thrown around in this thread for example . 
  pretty much * anyone * i know who is politically involved on the left side , including people who actually show up to the classic antifa demonstrations are distancing themselves from this shit and do n't want anything to do with it .
