  at least from my point of view it 's mostly the classic groups that consider `` acab '' and similar things a reasonable point of view that are celebrating this . 
  yes , that includes left-wing radicals from other groups but it 's by no means enough to pretend the german antifa as a whole and the rioters in hamburg are the same entity . 
   a good start is facing the rioters head on like they do in america . 
  i 'd not condoning the use of political violence , but presenting an united front , perhaps intimidating the rioters by making examples out of some of them in self-defense or removing their masks , would surely lead to victory in the streets . 
  that 's [ already being done ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3dta0e5f7k ) , with some people arguing that the initial zero-tolerance approach to masked groups was a major factor in escalating the entire thing . 
  whenever possible people with megaphones etc. 
  are also dragged out and pretty much peaceful protests still need to be broken up at times ( ~ 1:55 onwards in [ this ] ( https://www.pscp.tv/w/1mngeeaavywgx ) video for example ) . 
  the basic issue is that you have small groups roaming around the city like [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyvcjhytdwa ) , [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf6jw5injfq ) and [ here ] ( https://streamable.com/265fd ) ( [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/maikbrodersen ) twitter in general has some more short videos ) which spreads the available forces thin . 
  between protecting various objects , cleaning up sitting blockades and similar things there was just not enough manpower around . 
  i think police opened with 15000 people and they 've been continuously reinforcing numbers from all across the country since they realized they misjudged what is happening . 
  the main reason that you see cars burning out on the streets is pretty much the same , just for firefighters . 
   schr\u00f6der and putin are good pals even today . 
  i find it ridiculous how a former chancelloir works for fucking gazprom now . 
  * a u s g e l \u00f6 s t . 
  * yeah , he 's been working there since december 2005 . 
  he ` left ' office at the end of november of the same year and just two weeks prior the agreement to start the [ nord stream pipeline project ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#gazprom ) was signed . 
  just recently he celebrated his 70th birthday with putin . 
  that topic annoys me so much , simply because he both did highly questionable stuff to germany ( agenda 2010 or the above project come to mind ) but also managed to remove his party from political influence at the same time . 
  eh , both have [ rupert murdoch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rupert_murdoch ) and the americans get more out of [ robert mercer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_mercer_ ( businessman \\ ) ) . 
  do n't think the two and the organisations they own/support give each other * that * much . 
  fox , the sun & [ news corporation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/news_corporation#newspapers ) in general vs breitbart & [ cambrige analytica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_analytica ), 
   and you do not think that there might be a problem in there ? 
  there could be but i do n't think it 's possible to be informed enough to make a clear judgement . 
   hence percent of gdp is a better measure that numbers in dollar . 
  i 'm honestly doubtful here . 
  russia spends roughly 60 % more in terms of % of gdp than the us for example . 
  is the russian military 60 % `` stronger '' than the american one ? 
  do they have 60 % more military international influence than the americans ? 
  most people would argue no , that 's bullshit - the russian economy is just really crappy and they have to overspend on their military to keep up . 
  why ca n't we argue that the german economy is extremely strong if we compare it internationally and hence the underspending in terms of % / gdp is just as normal as russias overspending in terms of % / gdp ? 
  again , if germany would spend as much % / gdp as france for example we 'd sit at more than 80b per year . 
  that 's more than russia , roughly 1/3rd of the chinese or as much as france + italy combined . 
  from my point of view that level of spending would result in a military dominant germany at the heart of europe . 
  whether that 's a good or a bad thing is entirely debatable but calling it * desirable * because '' % / gdp makes more sense here '' is something i 'd consider highly questionable . 
  i especially doubt that personnel costs translate here easily since most of the strong gdp of germany is ** not ** about what most people are earning , it 's about a few earning much more than others . 
  income inequality and child poverty have been on the rise over the last 15 years for example , quite massively so . 
  that 's part of the reason * why * germany is so competitive lately compared to e.g. 
  france . 
  i 'd love to see a comparison of salaries for example , i 'd not be surprised if soldiers in the uk or france are getting * that * much different salaries than german ones to the point that they reflect the differences in gdp/pp . 
   german pilots have much less flying hours than pilots on other armed forces because the bundeswehr can not afford to give them more . 
  do you have a source for that at hand ? 
  i do n't doubt it , i just have a hard time finding it for myself . 
   again , there is a reason why military spending is measured in percent of gdp instead of the value in $ . 
  the average income in germany is ~ 3500 $ . 
  average income in italy is around 2500 $ . 
  this means for the same amount of money you can pay more soldiers in italy than in germany . 
  ( in russia it is 860 $ ) . 
  similarly , as long as a lot of military procurements are from domestic sources they will cost proportionally to the gdp . 
  that 's a sketchy way to look at it since the average salary of a soldier will not be proportionate to the average salary overall . 
  what we 'd have to look at is what most of the personnel costs go to and then compare those averages . 
  i 'd be willing to bet those are further from the average in germany than they are in italy for example but that 's another spot where i 'm having a hard time finding data for . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=401194 ) forum post could be a reasonable intro ( and shows what i mean by being all over the place and not directly related to gdp/pp or average salary ) but e.g. 
  [ payscale ] ( http://www.payscale.com/research/us/job=soldier/salary ) is missing this type of info for most countries . 
  overall what i 'm saying is that % / gdp does n't seem like it can be used as a `` not the same , we 're done '' - argument for these types of discussions . 
  if we 're realistic as long as eu members as a whole have access to nuclear weapons via themselves or via nato and enough conventional troops to be safe against russia ( lol ) and for their foreign interests ( which is something the us cares much more about than eu countries overall ) , there 's no shame in saving money . 
  and again , the reduction in personnel in germany in terms of % since 1994 are just as similar as those of the uk , france or italy . 
  * all * nations that have effectively secured peace should benefit from that by spending less on the military . 
  pretty much the only ( and imo totally viable ) reason to spend * more * from an eu perspective would be more independence from the us but that would include fleets and/or nuclear weapons on an eu level - something we 're very , very far away from at this point in time . 
   okay , but not all eu members are . 
  is it reasonable for disproportionate burden to fall on them , when it is because of them that germany enjoys that status ? 
  yes , all eu members are living in more peaceful times and those who * are n't * surrounded by allies still belong to a strong enough block that they 're not getting touched . 
  france for example scaled their army down [ almost as much as germany since 1994 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.totl.p1?end=2015&amp;locations=fr-de-it-es-hu-gb&amp;start=1994 ) . 
  500k -  300k is n't much different to 370k -  180k . 
  the uk went from 250k to 150k active personnel - again a 40 % reduction . 
  hungary ( -25 % ) or spain ( -5 % ) kept their military sizes roughly equal but they also had much smaller numbers to begin with . 
  italy reduced their size by almost 25 % since 1994 , closer to 40 % like the french if we look at their peak in 1995 . 
  yes , germany is the only one on that graph that actually reduced size by 50 % but if we just look at all the ones here for example everyone * could * have reduced their military by 50 % and we 'd still have reasonable - and pretty much almost the same - numbers . 
  main reasons for germany leading the charge here is a combination of historical factors , less foreign interests compared to e.g. 
  even the uk or france and similar things . 
  but some did n't scale down as much . 
  i really do n't see why it 's an issue if germany reduced strength by 50 % when france , italy or the uk reduced theirs by 40 % . 
  on top of that in raw spending germany stayed rather close to the other big players in europe ( france 55b , uk 48b , germany 41b , italy 28b ) - it 's only when you look at spending as a % of gdp that it looks like germany is spending much less . 
  and that 's where reality comes into play : there 's simply no reasonable scenario in which it makes sense for germany to outspend france & italy combined for example unless she wants to become a literal military leader of the eu - that 's what would happen if germany would invest a similar amount of % gdp as france for example . 
  it would be * third * worldwide , right in front of russia in that scenario . 
  * personally * i 'd like to see a bit higher spending and total amount for germany but that mostly to be an example and ready for a proper eu integration where it can take a leading position . 
  overall it 's not like * any * eu member has to fear russia or similar things based on spending or active personnel . 
  if the eu wants to be a global player that rolls into other areas then yes , everyone including germany is massively underspending and understaffed . 
  for what the eu nations are actually doing militarily it 's completely fine and most likely still overkill . 
   the vote in 2001 was 538 yes versus 35 no : https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2011/37148635_kw51_10_jahre_isaf/207270 that 's a completely different vote . 
  on the 16th of november 2001 [ the vote to militarily intervene ] ( http://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/afghanistan-einsatz-und-vertrauensfrage.932.de.html?dram:article_id=131357 ) was combined by chancellor gerhard schr\u00f6der with a vote of no confidence . 
  that vote decided whether germany will act militarily or not . 
  336 yes , 326 no . 
  what * you * are referring to was the vote on december 22nd 2001 regarding participating in the [ isaf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_security_assistance_force ) , the security mission in afghanistan . 
  the reasons that one got such a strong majority was that 1 ) the military mission itself and hence the sending of soldiers in the first place was decided already through the earlier vote , 2 ) it was not combined with a vote of confidence but a regular decision and 3 ) when you go there you might as well take part in the official `` more peaceful '' version . 
  it does in no way shape or form reflect an accurate picture on whether german mps at that time were in favor or against participating in the war in general . 
   and the question was n't `` has society benefited ? '', 
  ( although society does benefit from having a military that obeys civil authority ) . 
  the question was , `` are they killing and dying for society ? '', 
  and how are they not ? 
  who tells them to do it ? 
  whose orders do they obey ? 
  i 'd argue they 're killing and dying under the order and authority of a civilian government . 
  in some cases that aligns with societies interests , in some cases it does n't . 
  referring to soldiers as `` heroes that die and kill for society '' at least to me implies them doing it * for * society as in * for the greater good of * said society . 
  hence you need to look at the benefits society gained from such an involvement of which , at least to my knowledge , there were n't any measurable ones . 
  the guy you replied to did n't however . 
  =p came a bit out of place but yeah , that 's just wrong . 
   about afghanistan : i was referring to the vote in 2001 . 
  then saying it `` passed in the bundestag by a very large majority '' is straight up wrong . 
  the vote in 2001 went through with 336 yes votes with 334 votes required .
