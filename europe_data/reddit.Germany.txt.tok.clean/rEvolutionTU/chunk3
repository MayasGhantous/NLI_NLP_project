  they took in large numbers , they 're having problems like they never thought possible . '', 
   he continued , '' you look at what 's happening in brussels . 
  you look at what 's happening all over the world . 
  take a look at nice . 
  take a look at paris . 
  we 've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people . 
  there was no documentation . 
  there was no nothing . 
  so we 're going to keep our country safe . '', 
  he then proceeds to list terror attacks . 
  but sure , it 's just media spin and gullible people eating it up . 
  we have to ensure our rights to freely make posts on reddit . 
  look what 's happening in / r/worldnews , look at what 's happening in / r/de . 
  look at what happened last night in / r/europe . 
  / r/europe !, 
  who would believe this ? 
  they took in large amounts of moderators , they 're having censorship like they never thought possible . 
  you look at what happened in / r/jailbait . 
  take a look at / r/altright , take a look at / r/coontown . 
  we 've allowed thousands of moderators to censor us and we need to stop it . 
  they 're trying to appeal to disgruntled workers , employers and the actual right-wing while maintaining the appearance that they 're not that bad overall . 
  that 's how they grew so fast in the first place , a decent chunk of their voters came from left and moderate parties for various reasons . 
  with more left parties being electable with schulz and the some people in the afd being open about how far right they actually are they 're bleeding those types of voters again . 
  are you genuinely grilling someone for context when context ** makes it worse ** ? 
   `` here 's the bottom line , we 've got to keep our country safe , '' trump said . 
  `` you look at what 's happening . 
  we 've got to keep our country safe . 
  you look at what 's happening in germany . 
  you look at what 's happening last night in sweden . 
  sweden !, 
  who would believe this ? 
  sweden !, 
  they took in large numbers , they 're having problems like they never thought possible . '', 
   he continued , '' you look at what 's happening in brussels . 
  you look at what 's happening all over the world . 
  take a look at nice . 
  take a look at paris . 
  we 've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people . 
  there was no documentation . 
  there was no nothing . 
  so we 're going to keep our country safe . '', 
  he 's mentioning examples of `` you look at what 's happening . 
  we 've got to keep our country safe . 
  '' , he then pulls the list to germany , last night in sweden , pulls it to brussels and nice ( which ** have ** to be terror attacks he 's referring to , note him picking the ** exact ** same wording as in his previous sentences ) and pulls all of it back to `` so we 're going to keep our country safe . '', 
  but , sure , * the media * is spinning his words towards implying a terror attack . 
   how so ? 
  https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/832708293516632065 it 's really not that hard . 
   since we have to learn 3 foreign languages ohhh , i did n't even think of that . 
  yeah , that makes loads of sense , thanks for the explanation !, 
   you don \u00b4 t know what you say about austerity . 
  personally i 'm genuinely confused whenever `` austerity '' pops up . 
  i 'd like to claim that i understand the basic ideas of the pro- / contra - argument but every time the word is uttered in these threads it feels like there are suddenly dozens of economic experts who have in-depth knowledge about the topic . 
  but then most of the time those people seem incapable of actually arguing it well or offering any alternatives . 
   i do n't get afd supporters i * think * i do . 
  on average afd has the strongest base on facebook and they 're the ones with the most massive bubble behind them . 
  mostly automated twitters such as [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/amtickerde ) ( just to make it clear * please * be super careful if you consider clicking any links from there ) one spread news like wildfire on the far-right wing , so overall i 'd assume that side to have a tighter grip on information simply by riding the idea that everyone else is lying . 
  i 've also witnessed that side controlling the narrative in current events online by taking up top google results with shady websites . 
  once a few of those stories are believed and the `` the mass media is lying '' narrative works itself into your brain the next rational ( !! ), 
  conclusion is that if everyone hates on trump he must be someone who does amazing things . 
  i think that 's overall why ** the ** most distinct trump topic is n't the wall , immigration or illegals : ** it 's every media outlet or public opinion that disagrees with him being painted as fake . 
   most europeans are also aware that the american people voted for clinton and the republicans won due to a quirk of the us system . 
  out of all the things we can complain about i feel that spot is really inappropriate . 
  do i think the rules around the electoral college are undemocratic , absolutely terrible and should be changed ? 
  but those are still the rules . 
  it 's not a `` quirk '' that he exploited or something . 
  in my opinion there should be * some * acceptance here . 
  you 're also missing the religious extremism in his administration from trump himself being a [ born-again ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/trump-born-again/489269/ ) christian , over bannon who wants his christian militia , pence who [ is celebrated ] ( https://www.autostraddle.com/i-was-trained-for-the-culture-wars-in-home-school-awaiting-someone-like-mike-pence-as-a-messiah-367057/ ) among radical christians all the way to falwell ( the guy initially suggested for sec of education , now in charge of higher-ed policy ) whos own university hosts conferences such as [ `` homosexual rights and first amendment freedoms : can they truly coexist ? '' ] ( http://www.liberty.edu/law/news-and-events/&amp;artid=15273 ) . 
  overall there is a pretty substantial [ christian dominionist ] ( http://www.publiceye.org/christian_right/dominionism.htm ) pattern through the entire administration that should not be ignored . 
  sure , i * think * that 's what is likely . 
  but without a clear statement none of that 's a given and i 'd consider spd gaining a majority more of a gamble than anything else . 
  to me personally , without them excluding that coalition , they 're straight up not electable to me at all . 
   it will hurt the spd if people realize that voting for schulz might to people like wagenknecht i 'm in that camp personally . 
  if schulz does n't straight up exclude rrg then there 's ( almost ) no way in hell i 'd consider voting on that side of the spectrum . 
  ... and now the narrative changed from `` last night in sweden '' to `` in sweden '' without acknowledging the former was ever said :  @realdonaldtrump  my statement as to what 's happening in sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @foxnews concerning immigrants & sweden . 
  he actually was , he just uhm ... mis-spoke . 
  note how he also switched the topic from `` last night in sweden '' to `` in sweden '' :  @realdonaldtrump  my statement as to what 's happening in sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @foxnews concerning immigrants & sweden . 
  luxembourg . . you okay there buddy ? 
  i liked [ this ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/vn17j/in-english-this-happened-in-sweden-friday-night-mr-president ) response from aftonbladet.se, 
  in a nutshell : `` what happened last night in sweden '' was a fox show being shown on american tv about an incident in sweden in december . 
  edit , confirmed !, 
   @realdonaldtrump  my statement as to what 's happening in sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @foxnews concerning immigrants & sweden . 
  ____ i do n't exactly want to link the video since the best source i can find is from a rather obvious youtube spam account but on friday evening fox news ran a story about an incident this [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ami_horowitz ) had in december 2016 where claimed he was attacked by a vicious mob without any provocation and used it as an example for the catastrophically things that are happening all over sweden right now . 
  too bad there 's no video of the incident but lucky enough there 's an audio recording that starts just before he gets attacked in which people repeatedly are telling him `` i do n't want to be filmed '' ( his crew ran off at that point so sadly they could n't provide more accounts ) . 
  here 's some more of his account :  `` they repeatedly punched , kicked and choked me , as a number of bystanders watched . 
  eventually they dragged me into a building , which at the time i assumed was to finish me off . '', 
   `` once inside the apartment building vestibule , they resumed their vicious attack . 
  but seconds later someone opened an apartment door directly above us , and it luckily spooked them enough to run away . '', 
   he said he told police about the attack but that he was told that nothing could be done to be fair if that was what really happened then yes , fuck that kind of attack . 
  keep in mind though his claim was also that bystanders did not do anything and that police effectively denied him help . 
  * however * if the same thing would have happened to me , over here , and i 'd suspect him filming me specifically without my consent i 'd call the police on him . 
  depending on the circumstances that 's not really legal here which , if i understand things correctly , is similar in sweden and a massive difference to the us . 
   you look at what 's happening in germany , ** you look at what 's happening last night , in sweden . 
  ** sweden , who would believe this . 
  sweden . 
  they took in large numbers . 
  they 're having ** problems like they never thought possible ** . 
  you 're right , he did n't . 
  what things could you think of that , in the context of immigration , something that ` happened last night ' could be when the next sentence talks about ` problems ' ? 
  i fully agree that we should call it `` refers to non-existent swedish incident '' or something similar but he * did * go into a very specific direction here . 
  i 'm pretty sure at this point i 'm recognizing dqw4 in urls as if it was an actual word .
