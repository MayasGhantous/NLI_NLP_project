  326 voted against . 
  it ca n't be understated that this was combined with a vote of no confidence . 
  what this means is that if only 3 people of the majority coalition would have voted against it new elections would have taken place . 
  that 's the story of how a left/green coalition brought germany into the war in afghanistan , the tl ; dr is pretty much we elected a douchebag for chancellor and it took a bit to realize . 
    explain how our actions in afghanistan are for society  you ordered them there , right ? 
  you 're a constitutional democracy , right ? 
  he 's absolutely correct there . 
  the german involvement does n't benefit german society in any measurable form whatsoever . 
  how does the war in iraq benefit american society , the american people ? 
  now , admittedly it 's also a bit of a naive perspective since the `` benefits '' here are more obscure . 
  it showed loyalty to the us which at the time was a sensible decision and it most likely also helped in terms of training and similar things . 
  but did german * society * benefit from this in any measurable way ? 
  i would n't say so . 
  something like this going through anyway just happens sometimes , even in democracies . 
  there 's also the whole idea of 1 ) being able to save money there after the cold war and 2 ) german forces being restricted in size after the 2 +4 treaty . 
  if i remember correctly that meant west german military was forced to scale down from from ~ 500k in 1990 to below 370k in 1994 . 
  we 're currently at ~ 180k . 
  overall i think it 's reasonable to reap the rewards of living in more peaceful times and being surrounded by allies . 
  is there any eu country that actually scaled up their military after the cold war ? 
   he was awarded the ehrenmedaille der bundeswehr for exemplary service . 
  i presume you 're quoting from [ here ] ( http://www.gppi.net/team/mario-schulz/ ) ? 
   prior to joining gppi as an intern in july 2016 , mario served in the german military as a civil-military interaction analyst at an operational level headquarters , where he worked on non-military conflict dimensions in sub-saharan africa . 
  he was awarded the medal of honor of the german armed forces ( ehrenmedaille der bundeswehr ) for exemplary service . 
  i 'd be genuinely curious what that guy * actually * did since that site seems to be the only source . 
  what needs to be noted is that the medal talked about here is the lowest possible honor in the german military and it can be given to anyone who served for more than 7 months . 
  i 'm unable to find infos on how often it 's given out but i found [ this ] ( http://www.bundeswehrforum.de/forum/index.php?topic=47959.0 ) thread from a military forum where someone mentions it being given to him for arranging a car being towed which apparently was considered an above average performance . 
  so , yeah . 
  for all intents and purposes that biography tells us that he was a soldier , did n't do a bad job and is now an ** intern ** at the gppi in berlin . 
  he got his bachelor 's degree in the us and is now working at his master 's in international relations . 
  overall those credentials are n't as great as you just made them sound . 
  ___________ as for the war in afghanistan it 's overall an effort built on stabilizing the region with an economic focus . 
  the * reason * for these kinds of bills nowadays being passed with strong majorities ( 498 in favor in 2014 for example ) is overall the idea of `` we started getting involved there in 2001 and have to finish our jobs '' . 
  the majority of the population is against the continuation but the involvement is overall small enough that it 's not a big topic . 
  the overall german position on the war in afghanistan is easiest understood when you look at how we entered it in the first place : germany agreed to being a part of operation enduring freedom because the chancellor at the time * basically * blackmailed his own coalition into full support by combining the vote on it with a vote on his resignation . 
  despite that it was a close vote and was carried by a loyalty to the us more than anything else . 
  the vote for the war in iraq already went in the other direction after all . 
  the initial mandate with regards to afghanistan was for ~ 3900 troops and peaked at roughly ~ 5000 . 
  we 're now at ~ 1000 if i understand things correctly since the official nato portion ended in 2014 . 
  she 's also who is mostly deemed responsible for alienating his sons and isolating him from some of his friends . 
  kohls biographer heribert schwan referred to her as `` more than conservative , almost german nationalist '' and she tried to push demonstrably wrong facts into his biographies . 
  `` she tries to build a wall around him '' and `` she cares for , protects and controls him '' were quotes used to describe the relationship in 2012 . 
  the last ten years were n't exactly pretty in this regard . 
   religious people should marry in the name of thwir religion , but this wouldnt be recognised by the state . 
  as a minor sidenote , that is how it works in germany . 
  if you 'd like to you can get married by a catholic priest and the church of the flying spaghetti monster and it 's recognized by the state just the same : not at all . 
  in general you 're right though . 
  the concept of marriage * is * inherently unequal . 
  but we as a society decided to accept that since it 's beneficial if families overall are prospering . 
  now all i 'm personally missing is * some * legal framework for more than two people to start a family , that 'd be great ~, 
  from my point of view it was mostly that what we had and still have was * almost * equal to a regular marriage already so it was rather hard to get people excited about it . 
  when we did our first laws on this ( early 2000s ) they were rather progressive overall and then we just sat on that since it was good enough and under a conservative government anyway . 
  for me personally for example it just would n't be a vote-deciding issue since i did n't see much pressure on affected people and i saw it as something that will happen eventually anyway within the next couple of years . 
  that 's part of why it went so quickly all of a sudden , the laws were ready for years at this point . 
  all that was missing was * someone * ( in this case merkel ) declaring it an issue of individual conscience instead of party politics and it was done in an instant . 
  i think the main difference was that where the netherlands and belgium went all the way to full equality rather quickly germany stopped a few centimeters short because * christian conservatives * and `` just a bit of inequality '' is rather easy for people to shrug off as nothing crazy important . 
  not to mention she herself still ended up voting against it with a flimsy but still reasonable position . 
  * technically * the german constitution is interpreted by our courts as `` marriage '' being a thing between man and woman exclusively so she based her vote on that definition . 
  overall she both was part of blocking progress in that area , but now helped orchestrate the vote on the law * and * was able to keep face towards her own overall more conservative voterbase . 
  it should be noted that such a law being approved was only a matter of time at this point , the population was overall in favor but the affected people not being massively disadvantaged overall did n't make it a huge topic . 
  now most parties decided to make it a massive one and it pretty much turned into merkel shrugging and taking it away . 
  eh , i 'd shrug it off as you having some dicks and other countries having some dicks . 
  on one hand `` the british people '' have spoken and wanted brexit . 
  that 's where some schadenfreude makes sense even though it 's a bit juvenile in cases like this . 
  things like op are more like `` well , duh , they 're not gon na move their ** eu headquarter to a country that 's leaving the eu ** '' to me personally without much further emotional investment . 
  just from that perspective i 'm less likely to engage in this type of thread than someone who wants to be more * schadenfreudesque * and you 'll end up seeing more of that angle . 
  it 's overall a dumb situation but i can still be your so-called friend if you 'd like to . 
  i promise to be a bit less joyful about random crap like this and we can laugh at both of our leaderships doing retarded stuff together to remind ourselves to not start crying . 
  ... did you know that we , simplified , might privatize our glorious autobahn ? 
  you just got ta know where to look to laugh at or with others . 
  they are quoting dozens and hundreds of cases to establish why that map is complete bullshit . 
  * there 's your evidence right there . 
  *  and please try to answer my questions . 
  you did n't ask any . 
   what i understand that anything they put on thieir websites is untrue . 
  please provide evidence that uebermedien.de and standard.at are sources of untrue information in general or on this topic specifically . 
  i showed you why the map you linked is a made up fairytale and you can verify that yourself if you 'd like to if you google translate the above articles . 
  someone gives you evidence for his claim and your reply is : `` whatever those guys say is untrue anyway '' without showing anything to corroborate that kind of statement . 
  * that * is what ` untrue ' looks like . 
  you did n't , you made claims without any supporting evidence . 
  if you 're accusing others of being liars you better be able to back it up with actual sources . 
  could be translation related , not a good excuse but a reasonable explanation . 
  the [ german version ] ( http://www.dw.com/de/polen-das-gericht-muss-vor-gericht/a-39330039 ) ( which i presume is the original since it has a bit more content than the english one ) uses `` jaroslaw kaczynski '' throughout the entire article . 
  ** what is factually wrong about the article ** ? 
  quote an example , show me evidence that it 's made up and then we can work from there . 
  you 're the one who claims it 's ` questionable ' and tries to cast doubt on the entire thing . 
   according to me , the german mass media are not independent . 
  they are controlled . 
  for example - cases of refugees ' attacks and other islamists are not described . 
  that map you 're referring to there is one of the most well-debunked pieces of right-wing propaganda over the last couple of years in germany . 
  [ here ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000050835111/einzelfall-karte-ueber-kriminelle-auslaender-voller-fehler ) is standard.at mentioning it and [ here ] ( http://uebermedien.de/11488/kartenlegen-mit-kriminellen-auslaendern/ ) is uebermedien.de going in-depth into lots of specific examples . 
  all you need to do to understand the map is to * look at the evidence that is quoted for their cases * . 
  in a nutshell it quotes police reports and ** every single case that does n't report a blonde and blue eyed german ** gets slapped on the map . 
  police reports are , by definition , unreliable sources for who actually committed crimes and the descriptions included make no sense whatsoever . 
  this includes `` dark hair and bearded '' , `` eastern european looking '' , `` turkish looking '' or `` having darker skin '' . 
  all on there . 
  on top of that the categories are completely arbitrary , e.g. 
  `` arson '' includes people accidentally lighting their kitchens on fire . 
  and if that all was n't enough information is not adjusted if more things become known , sometimes it quotes articles of dubious origin that quote police reports wrongly and similar stuff that is all over the place . 
  there are literally * dozens * and hundreds of examples that are quotable to establish this point . 
  suddenly a 15 year old girl that lost her cell phone and did n't want to tell her parents about it turns into `` 15 year old sexually assaulted by foreigner '' .
