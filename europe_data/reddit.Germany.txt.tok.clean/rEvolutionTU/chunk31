  and another dot on the map !, 
  tl ; dr : that map is full of crap and in no way shape or form a reliable source for anything . 
  ______ you just used a map full of * literally * made up narratives to establish that `` german mass media are not independent but controlled '' . 
  that is more telling about the independence of where you choose to get information from than german media as a whole . 
  however , apart from all that you are correct in exactly one thing : dw.com * is * under the control of the german government . 
  but for example in this case their reporting sounds awfully close to what we know from e.g. 
  [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-constitution-iduskbn16n2kh ) . 
  maybe , just maybe it 's your sources which are biased and untrue in this case and not reuters or dw.com . 
  we know the author was there , we know there is a protest camp outside of the supreme court in warsaw and we know ( from the german version ) and the picture that at least one of the quotes is right there painted on a sign . 
  you 're expecting an author to show picture evidence of every single quote that he saw on a sign and ends up quoting in the article ? 
  you said the intro the picture and the whole article are questionable . 
  is the picture faked ? 
  do you have evidence for that ? 
  were factually wrong statements made in the article and can you show evidence for that ? 
  look , if there 's shit wrong in that article i 'd like to know , simply because i * do n't * know if any of the claims are true in reality . 
  however all you 're doing so far is saying things like `` that picture is questionable , the quote in the intro is n't true , the article is questionable ! '', 
  without actually giving someone asking you ** what exactly ** is wrong any evidence whatsoever . 
  again : what is * factually * wrong about article ? 
  i meant that in an endearing and joking way , guess that came across badly . 
  if you look at op ours for example is , despite german being the official language in germany , in german/english/french . 
  from that point of view it 's more the stereotypical '' * of course * the french would n't do something like that '' than anything else . 
  it 's almost as if multiple people can have different standards for what they deem reasonable . 
  you 're not clarifying what 's low level in your opinion though . 
  the intro ? 
  the picture ? 
  the actual content of the rest of the article ? 
  from my point of view apart from the `` toilet seats ... '' portion i do n't see anything that seems questionable . 
  what stands out to me is the influence the uk ( and northern ireland specifically ) has on these numbers :  more than half ( 76 ) of them were reported by the united kingdom . 
   dissident republican groups in northern ireland were involved in 76 attacks . 
  let 's kick that out for a clearer picture ( sorry uk ) . 
  66 total attacks remaining . 
  * 27 committed by left-wing groups ( italy , greece and spain are the only eu nations with left-wing or anarchist terrorist attacks - can anyone add some context here ? ), 
  * 23 by `` ethno-nationalist and separatist '' groups * 13 jihadist attacks , 6 of which could be linked to the so-called is . 
  overall , on an eu level , it 's pretty much 10 % of terrorists being responsible for 90 % of deaths from terrorism with not much else to add . 
  what makes this number rather difficult to think about in a larger context is that ( at least to my knowledge ) we do n't really know about killings and attacks that are islamist-motivated but not classified as terrorism while we * do * know about these things for both left - and right-wing groups . 
  i 'm actually curious what this looks like if we 'd take that into account but that quickly becomes a massive mess since , at least over here , we 're usually debating for decades when it comes to politically motivated murders whereas religious motivations have been obvious in the few cases ( or rather that one case ) where this was the actual background . 
  islamists are pretty much the only group that always tells you about who they are when it comes to terrorism . 
  there may be less of them but in this category they 're definitely by far the biggest issue when it comes to spectacular events and death tolls . 
   ` usun\u0105\u0107 s\u0105dzi\u00f3w zbrodniarzy z prl ' which can be translated for : ` get rid of felon judges from prl ' where prl is the name of communist poland and time when poles were murdered by communist law system . 
  i never actually knew about this being a thing but that can be explained by the differences between the english and german version of that article . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.dw.com/de/polen-das-gericht-muss-vor-gericht/a-39330039 ) the german version . 
   `` the court must go to court , '' reads one sign . 
  the protesters have arranged toilet seats , sofas , and rickety office furniture in a representation of how they see the polish justice system . 
  the second sign that was quoted is missing in the english version , i 'd roughly translate it as :  another one [ sign ] proclaims , `` criminals '' , judges that were kept from communist times , must be removed . 
  which sounds * very * close to what you just described regarding the prl . 
  _______ a reverse image search not being fruitful can be explained by the bottom right of the picture : g. gnauck is the name of the author of the article and hence the author of this picture . 
  [ here ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_gnauck ) his wikipedia page in polish . 
  from the german version he sounds overall reasonably credible and like someone who is well-versed in eastern european politics . 
  admittedly i ca n't find any other source talking about this specific protest camp either , but what i * did * find was [ this ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mjqte0nvwwc/wbj6ay02dti/aaaaaaaajv8/m1ms58qsoqsysszxq6trr9icquls0icqwclcb/s1600/img_0967%2bsupreme.court.of.poland%2b.jpg ) picture , apparently from [ this blog ] ( http://oeshoeblog.blogspot.de/2016/10/2016-10-01-central-europe-day-1-warsaw.html ) and hence from october 2016 . 
  now , i do n't know enough about poland here is uhm ... camping in front of the supreme court something you guys do all year round and the signs merely change from time to time ? 
  =p that 'd explain overall lower attention to this , since this article basically just uses the protest camp as a colorful introduction and not as a major topic that it revolves around . 
  notably he does n't talk about an actually massive * protest * but a * protest camp * and singles out two specific signs . 
  the `` toilet seats , sofas , and rickety office furniture '' story might be a bit exaggerated here when it comes to its meaning but welp , i think i can live with that overall . 
  is anything * besides * the first paragraph `` weird '' to you in any way shape or form ? 
  are those still in french only nowadays ? 
  we 're being all nice and inclusive over here , but no , the french got ta french . 
  i think that 's a good question with a really boring initial answer : i do n't think anything would change much at first . 
  it 's not like i consider german society to be an oppressed one that is only not violent and abusive because laws keep the population in check . 
  =p however , over time i believe these kinds of freedoms would be overwhelmingly be used by people who do n't exactly have the most noble intentions . 
  if i want to punch you in the face because i * really * hate you for what you look like or for whatever associations you might have then the prerequisite is just that : hatred . 
  even when i keep the calls for violence against the law tolerating calls for hatred as a society is not a good road i 'd like my society to go down overall . 
  i 'd argue that i 'm advocating an inherently modern german perspective on this when i 'm saying that to me letting ideologies and sentiments that go against the basic free democratic order of the state roam freely they * will * eventually spread and multiply . 
  given enough time and random chance they might even be able to infect the majority of the population and be forces behind actual political change . 
  i cherish my freedoms and i cherish democracy . 
  i understand that my freedom needs to end right where that of another person begins . 
  that means that i * gladly * give up some freedoms to a reasonable degree in return for others having to do the same - just like anyone else in developed nations does to some degree . 
  i have no reason to be afraid because of what i look like , where i 'm from , what my passport says or how i choose to be religiously interested . 
  i know that if someone decides to publicly attack me for any of these or similar categories that the law and society as a whole is on my side , no questions asked . 
  what i need to give up for that right is the freedom to make these attacks based on these types of categories against others . 
  and that , all things considered , is in my opinion an amazing trade for a developed society . 
  ** i , just like everyone else , am gaining the freedom to feel safe from those kinds of attacks and i am losing the freedom to attack others in , in my opinion utterly stupid and unconstructive , ways . 
  ** now , the obvious danger , like with so many good ideas , is that these things could be abused . 
  however i both trust our judges that they are well-enough educated and other citizens and myself that they 're vigilant enough regarding these topics . 
  as long as that is in place the only people losing from such an arrangement are those who actively * want * to freely discriminate based on all these mostly arbitrary categories that fit into their own personal biases . 
  is that overall an answer that sheds some light onto this perspective ? 
  meanwhile i think ours are more reasonable than those the us has nowadays . 
  what people tend to forget is that the idea of freedom of expression in germany is pretty close to what the us understood as freedom of speech in the 50s . 
  the main point is that saying things like `` we do n't have freedom of speech '' as if that kind of absolute is even possible does n't help any discussion since it will devolve into `` they have enough free speech that i approve of that i feel comfortable calling it * true * free speech ! '', 
  when pressed for a clearer definition . 
  that 's why [ the list of restrictions for the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech_in_the_united_states#types_of_speech_restrictions ) is n't exactly short either and there are quite some cases where their restrictions are * more * rigid than e.g. 
  german ones in practice . 
  [ student newspapers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/school_speech_ ( first_amendment \\ ) ) are a cool minor example here where in the us schools have much larger influence over content than in most german states nowadays . 
  this and similar approaches are a part of the reason why the us is usually rated so far behind lots of european countries , including germany , in the [ press freedom index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) . 
  i prefer * that * kind of freedom of speech over the freedom to yell `` god hates faggots ! '', 
  whenever i feel like it in public any time of the day . 
  different nations and cultures approach this differently and overall that 's totally fine from my point of view as long as it works well for both the nations as a whole and the individuals living in their societies . 
   but we still dont have freedom of speech that makes you equal to * literally * every single western democratic nation . 
  every single country has restrictions on speech because the opposite would not result in a functioning society . 
  where countries differ is where exactly they draw the line - but overall all these nations agree that * some * line has to be drawn . 
  1 ) people and places associated with terrorism are frequently raided and arrests are being made . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/hessen-gross-razzia-gegen-terrorverdaechtige-polizei-nimmt-tunesier-fest-a-1132602.html ) the first random google result from february where 54 buildings including 2 mosques were raided . 
  2 ) the last time i 'm recalling that someone was ` arrested for saying mean things on the internet ' was a case where people were calling for refugee homes to burn . 
  __________ considering that between january and september 2016 we had 57 cases of arson against refugee homes and 67 `` other attacks '' which includes 9 violations against explosive laws yes , that is a concern . 
  this number does not include attacks on individuals ( those went up by 400 % from 2014 to 2015 ) , the total amount of violent attacks on refugees in 2015 overall is at ~ 150 cases . 
  between [ january 2016 and june 2016 ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bka-zu-uebergriffen-auf-fluechtlinge-zahl-der-rassistischen-gewaltdelikte-erschreckend-hoch/13759764.html ) we 're talking about almost 100 violent attacks on refugee homes and ~ 150 violent attacks on individuals . 
  this is the same amount of attacks in half a year as we previously had through the entire year of 2015 . 
  note that all of this does n't include crimes against foreigners * in general * . 
  those numbers are also up . 
  _______ right-wing violence is on the rise since years at this point and a vast part of * why * it was able to rise so quickly was because resources are mostly used for what so far had much less of an impact on people 's lives in germany but is much more important politically : islamist extremism . 
  both are issues that need addressing because they 're representing growing threats to german society - that 's why both are being addressed .
