  _______ playing down people calling for violence on social media simply because they 're right-wing and not islamists like you 're doing here is utterly dishonest , distasteful and counterproductive to the overall issue . 
  i for one want both these scenarios treated equally . 
  eu wide gender ratios ! = gender ratio for individual countries . 
  in fact those differences between countries are precisely * why * numbers for female refugees are going up in germany since the beginning , albeit slowly : german law here is , to my understanding , set up in a way that makes it comparatively easy to bring family if the initial claim was accepted . 
  the idea that guys go first and bring their women/kids later is part of how the system is expected to work . 
  a country that does n't do that for example will have a much higher male to female ratio in the long run than the german approach but also smaller numbers in total . 
  i 'd not even be surprised if the majority of female refugees that are coming into the eu now are going to countries with similar laws to germany . 
  hence some countries will have much more male-heavy overall amounts of refugees while others will have much more females in comparison to the average . 
  i ca n't just take overall numbers and assume they 'll distribute evenly across all nations who take anyone in . 
  you are ** more ** than 200k off since the source you cited does not talk about gender ratios in germany but overall ratio . 
   still not as far off as the guy i was replying to , to be fair . 
  even if we assume ~ 700k is correct ( which no one has shown evidence for so far ) then he was off by exactly as much as you were since he said `` 400k-500k '' . 
   so the ratio of males to females for all 1.3 refugees ( which is what we are talking about ) is not 62 % as they claimed . 
  correct , which i just mentioned . 
  however , you have n't shown any source that talks about gender ratios in germany either . 
  _________ basically he was wrong ( and was downvoted for it ) but at least he quoted an official number related to the topic at hand . 
  you were wrong the first time ( and received upvotes for it ) and then quoted stats that are n't referring to the topic at hand but * do * show the exact same bias from when you were wrong the first time ( and got more upvotes for that one ) . 
  what he did can be an honest mistake ( just as much as your initial unsourced claim ) but when you make a second claim where the source that i presume you read and understood is n't about the topic at hand it 's hard to shrug it off as just another honest mistake . 
  __________ e :  only vaguely related ? 
  i assumed that the demographics of germany 's refugees were not that different to those of the eu as a whole , which is not an unreasonable assumption , especially considering that germany takes in the bulk of refugees . 
  not unreasonable for sure , but still an assumption that was n't proven to be true . 
  i ca n't quote eu numbers for overall gender ratios and project them onto individual countries . 
  does n't matter whether it 's about refugees or the general population . 
  hell , i ca n't even take gender ratios of the german overall population and assume that they 're similar to that of various german states across all agegroups - i 'd be massively off in more than one case . 
   overall , around 70 % of refugees are male , not 62 % . 
  the source you 're quoting does not talk about the 1.3 million migrants ** to germany ** which is the topic we 're currently discussing . 
  / u/zehferris was quoting a [ german federal agency ] ( https://charts.bpb.de/zy0zk/index.html ) ( to be more specific the [ bamf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_migration_and_refugees ) ) and 62 % ** is ** the correct number for 2017 alone . 
  admittedly that is lower than the average so far , that 's where he was off a bit . 
  fact is that while it certainly started out with 69 % male applications in 2015 gender ratios have since become less male heavy and are now at 62 % for the current year . 
  you just made these two statements back to back :  at least 70 % are adult men , that means there are at least 900,000 adut men  54 % are adult males ... that means over 700,000 adult males . 
  your first number was completely off so you found a statistic that is only vaguely related with the topic at hand but sounded good enough so you rolled with that and it 's getting upvoted without anyone doublechecking that * slight * inconsistency . 
  / r/europe please . 
  to add some stats from a german perspective [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2fjunge-deutsch-tuerken-halten-sich-fuer-religioeser-als-die-alten-a-1097936.html ) is the google translate about a recent look at the descendants of turkish immigrants in germany . 
  in short 2nd ( and more so 3rd generation ) say about themselves that they 're more religious than the 1st generation while simultaneously praying less , visiting mosques less and having less radical opinions . 
  it should be noted that this is pretty much the perspective i have of most christians in germany where religion is * called * something important but does n't have a massive impact in daily routines . 
  that 's also the light in which the growing perspective that `` muslims should not adapt to german culture '' has to be seen among them : * the majority of them already did . 
  * the bad news is that more than 50 % feel like second class citizens and claim that , despite trying , they feel like it 's impossible to be recognized by german society as being a part of it . 
  at the same time 90 % + feel happy to be in germany and feel close to the country . 
  ____________ all in all , especially if you compare descendants of turks in germany to 2nd/3rd generation muslims in the uk they 're setting an extremely good example when it comes to religious integration . 
  where issues * do * exist however is when we look at for example the growing influence of the grey wolves and associated groups , even though at least to my knowledge those groups are n't known for violence or terrorism ( so far ) but that 's definitely something that needs to be kept an eye on . 
  if anything german turks are among the bigger victimized groups of [ right-wing terrorist organizations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground_murders ) in germany . 
  hey , the us gdp could also * shrink * so quickly that germany could overtake them !, 
  not like that 's realistic ( or desirable ) either but you never know what was going on in that guys head . 
   the political stability and economic growth have been impressive . 
  i would n't call the political stability impressive from a german perspective . 
  remember , she 's our third chancellor since 1982 . 
  =p in terms of economic growth while certainly true it should n't be the most important or sole measurement . 
  income inequality is still rising , the number of germans living below the poverty line has been rising steadily since 2001 and the amount of poor children is at a record high that was n't seen since the 60s . 
  admittedly this is the result of of [ her predecessor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010#consequences ) for the most part but nevertheless these issues * have * to be addressed very , very soon or the situations might become even worse . 
  we created wealth and growth but we 've been utterly terrible at ensuring it 's being distributed to the benefits of the entire population . 
  the followup subs named in the post there from 1 month ago have 102 and 40 subscribers respectively . 
  meanwhile / r/le _ pen is at almost 15k and completely dead . 
  what an authentic and massive * movement * . 
  sometimes i wish we 'd know where other users on reddit are actually from . 
  i feel like an idiot for bringing this up myself on a regular basis when it comes to politics ( where the us democrats , for the most part , align with what i associate with centre-right politics in germany ) , but then not consciously applying the same idea to us media as well . 
  shows how well narratives work when they 're just repeated often enough , thanks for bringing me back on track . 
  to my understanding british muslims are overall a much bigger issue in terms of radicalization than muslims in the us or when compared to muslim turks in germany . 
  i talked about this with sources [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fs6r3/commission_readies_sanctions_against_the_visegrad/dikteuf/ ) a bit ago but the gist seems to be that in the us the group most prone to radicalization is the 2nd generation specifically ( not 1st or 3rd ) while in germany both 2nd and 3rd generation become more religious when you ask them directly but they also pray less , visit mosques less and become less radical in their viewpoints . 
  at least compared to those two countries the uk having such a surge in radical opinions for both 2nd * and * 3rd gen seems to be the outlier . 
  there has to be * something * the uk does that makes this massively worse . 
  the best explanations i 've seen so far are these types of things , but they 're overall rather vague , unspecific and not really satisfying :  she said : `` the emergence of a strong muslim identity in britain is , in part , a result of multi-cultural policies implemented since the 1980s which have emphasised difference at the expense of shared national identity and divided people along ethnic , religious and cultural lines . 
  ...  `` there is also a problem of a lack of opportunities . 
  some people have been brutalised by their experiences with the police and this war on terror . '', 
   and this will simply feed into the us vs them mentality of tribalism . 
  this will further radicalize the muslims on the edge . 
  every single far-right crime or attack feeds islamist terrorism and every single islamist motivated crime or attack feeds the far-right . 
  * both * have the goal of eliminating the grey , eliminating moderates , and both hurt regular people like you and me the most . 
  and if we 're intellectually honest then radical islamists fit most major descriptions of what we usually associate with `` far right '' in the first place . 
  it 's not terrorist organisations and political headquarters getting attacked , it 's regular citizens for fucked up goals in the hopes that this makes * other * regular citizens join the frenzy by appealing to most basic instincts and mentalities . 
  and , maybe worst of it all , in the classic machiavellian sense both feed into governments becoming stronger because that 's the most obvious viable third direction : strong governments that can protect the population from both extremes . 
  the * only * remaining choice that i 'm personally aware of is to not give in to the emotional feedback loops all of these dynamics rely on . 
  as corny as it sounds , the only thing every single person living in a western society should truly be afraid of is fear itself . 
  and that is something that only every single individual can work out for themselves . 
  the probably best thing every single one of us can do to contribute is to give it a few hours or even days , let investigators do their job and be supportive of the victims . 
  in the end , we 're all in this together no matter of our backgrounds or affiliations . 
   fox is shit . 
  they make up stuff on purpose and ignore factual news that comes out later . 
  cnn is more factual , but they 're also shit , because they spend hours covering one story , which they 've blown out of proportion , while ignoring other news which is arguably more important . 
  what always confuses me is that during the munich shooting cnn was the one ~ ~ making up ~ ~ finding an unnamed and to this day unconfirmed witness that made statements that no other testimony or evidence ever supported - to paint it as having an islamist connection . 
  half a year later the entire network is supposed to be left-wing . 
  it 's probably not , it 's a money making machine that does whatever brings in the dough at the time . 
  the 24h news cycle is a pretty damn terrible idea overall . 
  something i found a few months ago was the wikipage of the [ centennial olympic park bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/centennial_olympic_park_bombing ) . 
  ctrl + f for `` christian '' and you 'll understand what i mean specifically . 
  the german , french and spanish versions of the page all very clearly mention this connection . 
  the english speaking version however got [ changed a while ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5tg4qg/handful_of_highly_toxic_wikipedia_editors_cause_9/ddn8c2e/ ) and the last remnant of what * actually * was the motivation is the category at the very bottom of the page . 
  the `` see also '' list is also ... a bit of a different direction . 
  in addition to what was already said the wikipage on the [ agenda 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) is a reasonable start . 
  in a nutshell social benefits were cut massively across the entire population and regulations were lifted , hence allowing for easier founding of new businesses but also easier firing and hiring . 
  overall this made germany much more competitive but also shifted away income from those who needed the most . 
  unemployment rates [ across states ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/image/45604/max/600/600/2b3adc19cd6f0babf0e33a3db25b9c41/vo/arbeitslose-1-jpg.jpg ) are still massively different ( ranges from 3.5 % -15 % ) and now regions of the former gdr are for example our main problem when it comes to right-wing extremist voters and hatecrimes against foreigners . 
  unemployment went down , but income inequality went up massively :  another sign that economic inequality has risen in germany can be seen in the fact that the number of germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11 % in 2001 , to 12.3 % in 2004 , and about 14 % in 2007 . 
  according to 2007 government statistics , one out of every six children was poor , a post-1960-record , with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  a lot of the jobs are temporary/contractual or part-time which results in less evenly distributed income . 
  all of these things did * not * peak yet but are still getting worse and most likely will continue to do so unless we or others come up with better solutions . 
  ___________ what needs to be noted in terms of unemployment rates specifically is that * german * stats differ from most * international * stats used in comparisons . 
  that 's why for example when [ googling for it ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=arbeitslosenrate%20deutschland ) you will see figures around 4 % while at the same time the [ first result ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1224/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-deutschland-seit-1995/ ) in german lists a 50 % higher unemployment rate of 6 % . 
  the issue here is that most international comparisons ( iirc both eurostat and imf treat unemployment like this ) see a person working even 1h per week as employed where the responsible german agency ( bit simplified ) can and mostly does include people who work below 15h per week as unemployed . 
  ______ tl ; dr : germany went too ` murica with less social benefits & less regulations and is now seeing more of exactly what that entails . 
  meanwhile [ schr\u00f6der ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#criticism_and_controversies ) is the chairman of the board of the [ nord stream ag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream_ag ) and his party is * still * overall incredibly weak in large parts due to that entire story .
