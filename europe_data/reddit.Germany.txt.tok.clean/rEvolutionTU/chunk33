  in a nutshell the `` social democratic '' center-left went full economical right under his leadership and we 're now experiencing what that direction looks like in practice . 
  meanwhile he 's still laughing all the way to the bank & having birthday parties with putin . 
  overall we succeeded in creating wealth and prosperity but we failed at distributing it across the population . 
  that latter part needs solutions asap before it gets even worse . 
  honestly from my point of view i 'm genuinely hoping you guys somehow come up with a better solution than germany did and we end up importing it . 
  the bad sides are n't pretty at all .

   was because of massive popular opinion following fukushima it was n't fukushima that triggered a public pushback against nuclear energy , it were events a few months prior . 
  i think most people forgot about that though since it was sold as a decision due to fukushima , not due to a massively unpopular decision in the first place . 
  october 2010 merkel ii went through with the [ laufzeitverl\u00e4ngerung ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/laufzeitverl%c3%a4ngerung_deutscher_kernkraftwerke ) which , overly simplified , was a mild attempt at pushing nuclear power forward again by extending current contracts instead of getting rid of it completely as originally planned by the greens/spd . 
  this was followed by * massive * protests in germany against nuclear energy , the size of which has n't been seen since the 80s . 
  fukushima in march 2011 was just a good ` reason ' to go back and scrap the entire project because it was so massively unpopular to begin with . 
  yes , there were more protests at that time but from my perspective most of those simply carried along the momentum from the previous autumn . 
  so while * technically * and officially fukushima was the reason for backing down on nuclear energy in summer 2011 the actual cause can be traced back rather clearly to the protests against the * laufzeitverl\u00e4ngerung * not even a year prior . 
  ... am i the odd one out if i think it 's a bit weird/distasteful to use recent pictures in these articles ? 
  if i end up doing great things during my lifetime i would n't want to be remembered as the person i ended up being * after * all those peaks . 
  [ here ] ( http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/kohl-mitterand-verdun-1984/ ) is some more background for anyone curious . 
  such a powerful gesture . 
   if the president is really good you 're wasting potential while definitely true , if it * is * renewable you 're also wasting potential because it 's important for the current one to keep people who can challenge him or her `` small '' which means it 's harder for in theory great candidates to grow strong . 
  both kohl and merkel are decent examples there . 
  in practice i think the benefits outweigh the costs but i do n't think it 's * that * much of a difference . 
  yeah i do n't think that 's a list that can have a clear winner . 
    it 's vague because it 's foreign to you . 
   no , it 's vague by definition because whether an action is hateful or incites hatred is relative . 
  yeah , i do see where you 're coming from . 
  what i mean is that in practice it creates very specific rules and guidelines that are not argued about most of the time . 
  hence these kinds of laws are not vague to me but * seem * incredibly vague to you because you lack the same cultural background and education as me . 
  in the end that 's what counts , that they 're precise and effective for the society that implements these ideas . 
  again , for me gun law in the us is a chaotic mess overall where i 'd never be sure where exactly what kind of weapon is allowed in which form with what license . 
  if you grew up with that system and/or how states around you handle it differently it becomes a non-issue , * even * if it is sometimes overall vague and inconsistent . 
   that 's just your german worldview speaking . 
  there is no reason unrestricted free speech is impossible . 
  the only exceptions i can imagine are a direct threat of physical violence , which is an act of coercion , or fraud , which is theft , and they are only exceptions because they can not be separated from their physical counterparts . 
  harassment or libel come to mind . 
  false statements of facts in front of courts , false allegations having no repercussions . 
  those are just the first things that come to mind where most nations ( including the us ) agree that they ca n't be unlimited . 
  if you 're genuinely thinking that completely unrestricted free speech is a good idea then it reminds me a bit of the good old `` communism is great , just no one ever tried it ! '', 
  - sure that * might * be true in some ideal theoretical society , but for now , with the humans we know and are we have never seen any nation implement such an idea . 
   you would make a great us judge lol . 
  that 's how they perceive the constitution , as a living document that outlines general principles which they are meant to clarify into specific law . 
  the men who originally wrote the laws might take issue with that . 
  :p `` they perceive '' is a bit of a stretch , since the whole interpreting the constitution is [ quite debated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judicial_interpretation ) in the us from what i understand . 
  the basic issue is that it 's a * linguistical * argument and hence ca n't be solved objectively at all . 
  the idea of seeing such a document as a living thing that needs to be clarified is something inherent to german law nowadays , in parts because at the time of the founding of the modern german state that 's the view germany learned from the us and it seemed like the most logical approach . 
  when in doubt i think it 's somewhat reasonable to think of the average german perspective as a bit similar to the us perspective of the 50s/60s when it comes to topics like this , it 's not a coincidence that my views there sound familiar . 
   it 's not hard to understand the intent for us because we can look at the debates and writings of people who created the document to know the purpose of each part . 
  now we 're * still * trying to solve linguistical issues based on historical evidence . 
  if it would be easy , it would n't be so hard to agree on what * actually * was intended . 
  my personal favorite is the [ electoral college ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #original _ plan ) which was based on great but completely unrealistic and false assumptions . 
  circumstances change and evolve - yet now people defend the current form of the ec as something that the founders wanted when the founding fathers massively criticized what it turned into shortly after the inception of the us . 
  when you look at what hamilton & madison had to say about things like the general ticket or electors not voting their conscience at all - or even how they perceived the idea of parties in the first place it 's rather obvious that the original intent was completely lost rather quickly . 
   no i do n't believe it does . 
  i have heard the arguments from the other side and evaluated the evidence , after which i came to a conclusion . 
  now i 'm genuinely curious , maybe i overshot with my initial assumption : why do you think i 'm in favor of what you 'd refer to as hate-speech laws ? 
   the very fact that you have different laws than we do implies that you think your way is better . 
  ( if you approve of the law i mean ) i can think of `` our '' approach as ` better ' in an abstract sense while * still * fully respecting how the us does it , understanding why it does it and realizing that their way is better * for them * . 
  take gun laws again . 
  even though i think some european states have ` better ' gun laws than the us ( and i 'm not informed enough to be precise here , please do n't pin me down ) i can understand us gun laws , the culture that goes along with it and come to the conclusion that simply saying `` ours would be better , even for you '' would be completely moronic , unrealistic in practice and arrogant as fuck because after all your society seems to work reasonably despite a difference here . 
  hence i can see the us approach as both ` worse ' but also equal . 
  in a nutshell i 'm emphasizing that i 'm fully aware of the ** subjectiveness of my view of what 's better ** and think that 's a courtesy that should extend to most things that are , if we 're really honest , rather small stuff in the overall picture . 
  as for hate speech laws it 's similar : ours are primarily based on looking at how countries like the us saw freedom of speech at the time , trying to understand the intent behind regulations and then working from there logically , with lessons learned from history in mind . 
  here i consider it ` better ' because to me it looks like a clear progression from what the literally best teacher in the world for this topic did at the time . 
  that does n't invalidate that the us as a nation decided to develop into a different direction . 
  i ca n't claim an absolute moral highground simply because the us developed differently - maybe for your people with your culture a different approach will be more successful in the end . 
  it 's * mallorca * , basically german anyway . 
  jokes aside , since i 've seen kids of turkish/russian immigrants shout at each other that the other side should fuck off because they do n't belong to germany stuff like this does n't even surprise me . 
  trying to defend some `` ingroup '' by telling `` outsiders '' that they do n't belong to it is a rather common way of trying to fit in . 
  after all , if you go as far as defending ` your ' group against outsiders then you must * really * be part of this group , right ? 
  but yeah , this kind of stuff does make [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gqzv8/a_german_neonazi_group_breaks_into_a_concert_in/dised5c/ ) kinds of pictures further down more understandable . 
  the scenarios basically suck for everyone involved , tourists and citizens alike . 
  got ta stick together against that bullshit in the end . 
   well the uk has a vague hate speech law . 
  burning that book could symbolize hatred for muslims . 
  anything could be construed as inciting hatred , but that is their law . 
  it 's vague because it 's foreign to you . 
  if this exact case would have happened in germany for example i 'd understand the initial arrest to some degree ( because you * could * make the case that this aims to threaten muslims because of their religion ) but i 'd expect it to get thrown out immediately or not even prosecuted because none of his statements imply intent past the act of burning itself . 
  `` anything could be construed as inciting hatred '' is a statement you can only make because you have no idea how laws in other countries work . 
  it 'd be like me saying `` look at the first amendment , that means i can say anything i want anywhere in the us under any circumstance '' and most americans would laugh at me for being so naive and taking it literal . 
   the law is clear , it is the courts who began to carve out exceptions . 
  that is my point . 
  what is unclear about : that you ** do ** have lots of laws abridging the freedom of speech or of the press that exist anyway . 
  most of them are widely accepted and respected since the us - like any other nation on the planet - understands that unrestricted free speech is impossible and something that ca n't work in practice . 
  societies can literally not function if you allow all kinds of speech with no exceptions . 
  it 's hard to blame courts when this is a literal case of laws interfering with the basic idea . 
  that 's how the us does laws in general to my understanding , where you start with a generic broad statement or idea ( think 2nd amendment ) and then tack on exceptions over time and keep trying to interpret it as society changes . 
  the initial statement , if we can even understand the intent properly after all that time , is comparatively irrelevant to legal practice . 
   clearly we need to do a better job of educating our judges to respect the constitution instead of consider it their task to interpret its meaning . 
  you mean to respect * your personal interpretation of the constitution as a layman * which is just as irrelevant as my personal interpretation of it . 
  you 're basically claiming that judges and lawmakers have been ignoring the us constitution for hundreds of years in some cases - it 's you who has the extremist view then , not the judges or lawmakers . 
   i disagree . 
  the us way is better , aside from the violations that you pointed out . 
  at that point the discussion is done since you show zero intent of trying to understand other sides and their reasoning . 
  if i say `` gun laws in the eu way are way better than the us '' then i 'm uninformed and making an irrational statement without even an attempt at understanding the idea of why us culture does it difference in the first place . 
  `` my/our way is better and everyone else is misled/an idiot/hasn ' t seen the light '' is a pretty dumb stance in any discussion . 
  it 's pretty much based entirely on projection and ignorance . 
   obscenity is also allowed in the us , the only thing is that it is restricted in some contexts , which is also the case for a lot of speech , where time , manner , and place restrictions are possible , but outright prohibition is not . 
  to my understanding the miller test is a lot more specific here citing things like `` whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value '' and similar things to determine whether speech can be regulated in a specific case . 
   the us supreme court has already ruled in 1989 that burning of symbols was constitutionally protected that 's straight up incorrect , see [ virgina v. black ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginia_v._black ) , 2003 :  cross-burning can be a criminal offense * if the intent to intimidate is proven * . 
  to my knowledge that idea is still active in modern us law and i would not be surprised if this extents to other religious symbols .
