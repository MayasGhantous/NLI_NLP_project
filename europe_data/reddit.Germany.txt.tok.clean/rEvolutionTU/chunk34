  burning a bible because you hate christianity , fine . 
  burning it with the intent of threatening the group as a whole ( this is where germany would draw the line ) - also fine . 
  burning it with the intent of * threatening individuals * - not fine . 
   finally , most advocates of censorship always make the circular argument that since there is no such thing as free speech , there ought to no such thing as free speech . 
  that is what you do whenever you use one type of censorship to argue for other type of censorship . 
  it 's just illogical . 
  agreed . 
  i 'd be surprised however if that 's the reason * most * advocates for any restriction on free speech give . 
  maybe that 's a us thing , i ca n't recall seeing that argument be used over here ever . 
  _________  when it comes to hate speech laws , what i would say is 1 ) they do n't work 2 ) they are unjustifiable intrusion into freedom of conscience , thought , and expression because they punish people for expressions of ideas , opinions , and feeling 3 ) they are too broad and vague and open to abuse and 4 ) they are always used by political majorities to attack political minorities . 
  1 ) is a bit of a weird statement without further context or evidence , otherwise this is where i 'd reply `` they work here '' and we 'd be stuck in a loop . 
  2 ) is something that you believe because of your personal cultural background and that 's hard to sell as some universal truth . 
  note , i 'm not saying the us approach is * worse * than for example the german one - but i can understand the ideas behind both of them and they 're based on completely different views of how humans act on a larger scale . 
  i elaborated a bit more [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6gktqa/man_and_woman_are_arrested_over_facebook_video_of/dirpcgb/ ) . 
  hell , i 'd go as far as saying i admire the us approach because it 's extremely positive and idealistic - i just think it 's * too idealistic * once i take into account my own cultural background . 
   3 ) they are too broad and vague and open to abuse kind of true , but that again comes from a different legal understanding . 
  when i as a german tell you that our modern legal system is literally built around the concept of `` human dignity '' then you 'd call that vague and prone to abuse as well most likely . 
  for me however it 's a concept that creates a very specific legal framework for society . 
  it 's too broad , vague and open to abuse because you do n't understand it well enough . 
  it 's a bit similar as if i 'd call the second amendment `` too broad , vague and open to abuse '' while ignoring 200 years of legal background for it in the us and vast differences across states . 
  it took me quite some effort to be able to understand and even appreciate how the us does things when it comes to these things , i 'd not be surprised if that 's the same the other way around . 
  it 's never easy to understand things that initially seem completely contrary to what you were brought up with . 
   4 ) they are always used by political majorities to attack political minorities . 
  goes back to my elaboration on 2 ) . 
  the for example german idea is that if a society decides it does n't want specific ideologies , period ( which in germany is true for example for both communism and fascism/nazism ) then you * have * to regulate against it . 
  the idea is that if you let them spread freely then , given enough time and the right circumstances , they * will * be able to reshape society in their image if you let them . 
  someone who wants to destroy fundamental principles like democracy or freedom only needs to win once and decades or centuries of them can be gone in an instant . 
  the american idea here is more deeply rooted in classical enlightenment ideas - you think that something like this ca n't happen because * fundamentally * humans are decent beings and a majority would never go along with such rhetoric . 
  history taught the european continent and germany specifically a different lesson . 
  and * that * core difference in how humans are seen can explain pretty much all differences in terms of how speech is regulated . 
   i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  i 'm saying that the first amendment allows burning a bible , but that does n't mean that people are immune to being arrested by police or attacked by our court system . 
  i 'm saying that you 're measuring with two different sticks here . 
  if your argument in this us example is `` yeah , that 's police and courts acting in contradiction of the law '' then so is this case in the uk . 
  * neither * country prohibits the burning of religious symbols to my knowledge , yet the reason for the guys arrest in the us was `` on suspicion of ** one count of unlawful symbol burning ** '' . 
   i do n't think it matters whether the laws are used now or not . 
  ( i could link you cases where they are , but what good would that do ? ), 
  the fact that they are law means that you could fall afoul of them at any time . 
  that 's how laws work , all across the globe , which usually makes for [ these ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weird-laws-in-america_us_56a264abe4b0d8cc1099e1cd ) kinds of funny lists . 
  it 's illegal to ride a horse under the influence in colorado but no one cares about the law text since no one tried to do anything based on that law since ages . 
  `` the fact that the law exists '' is completely irrelevant when you look at legal practice and peoples daily lives . 
  i 'm fully aware that they * are * used sometimes in some nations in europe , but overall to my knowledge , those are clear minorities and exceptions . 
  the reason i 'm making that statement is that if you look at [ this list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law ) for example i know that law in germany is * not * directed at ` blasphemy ' but at the * intent * of such statement or act . 
  if the intent is found to publicly attack someones religion with the only goal of attacking it with no goal other than to cause trouble then that is considered an issue . 
  ... and since that is such a , typically german in these cases , vague definition we 're ending up with a [ rarely enforced law ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12174806/germany-fines-man-for-blasphemous-car-bumper-stickers.html ) that suddenly is much more specific than `` the person burned a religious book '' . 
   no i meant it is much more common to charge people for speech crimes in europe . 
  some cases involving the koran are starting to crop up here in the us unfortunately , but at least our law is clear on the matter . 
  your law ** is not clear ** on the matter . 
  what 's mostly clear is the * modern interpretation of said laws * and that 's something ~ 80 years old . 
  look at the reasoning given for [ chaplinsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fighting_words#chaplinsky_decision ) where parts of the idea are still in effect today . 
  to my understanding in the us burning a religious text is fine . 
  burning it to make a statement about the religion , even in public , also fine . 
  but all that needs to happen for it to be questionable is if it 's a statement that is made * personal * . 
  apart from that , yeah , overall it 's more common to charge people for speech crimes in europe , which kind of stems from a fundamental difference in how humans are viewed . 
  saying `` at least the us is clear '' and implying the way the us does is straight up * better * is extremely ignorant there and relies entirely on projection . 
  i for one ca n't say that the european or even specifically german ways are * better * but i can fully understand the reasoning behind them and consider them sensible - just like i can consider the us approach sensible when i fully understand the idea behind it . 
   eric minerault was booked into the yavapai county detention center late on thursday ** on suspicion of one count of unlawful symbol burning ** stemming from the incident at the gospel rescue mission , prescott police spokesman lieutenant ken morley said in a written statement . 
  it does sound more specific than public safety based on that quote . 
  so would i. 
  but then again i 'd also assume the same will happen in this case , unless this is a general thing in the uk for * all * kinds of burnings that get advertised in a public space . 
   courts and police can always act in contradiction to the law , that 's not the same thing as burning bibles actually being illegal there is no law in the uk that makes burning a bible or koran illegal so in your opinion this is also a case of courts and police acting in contradiction of the law i presume ? 
  also the very next sentence is :  but pochoda , who was not familiar with the charge cited , said courts have upheld laws that bar symbols like crosses from being burned . 
  ...  a common or accepted thing like in europe first , europe is not a state - the eu does n't have any blasphemy laws . 
  second , that 's going to need a good citation in terms of how many people are * charged * or * convicted * because of blasphemy laws across europe . 
  denmark is a prime example of a country that had blasphemy laws for ages yet when a case was pushed to court the law was repealed . 
  analogue to the [ b\u00f6hmermann affair ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b\u00f6hmermann_affair ) in germany , where the guy was charged with a law regarding `` insulting of organs and representatives of foreign states '' that was n't used for decades . 
  now that someone actually tried to * sue * regarding said paragraph it 's getting kicked out . 
  overall calling people getting charged or convicted because of the burning of religious books in europe `` common or accepted '' does seem highly dishonest and false , but maybe you have sources that can establish that kind of claim that i 'm not aware of . 
  yeah , just do n't [ burn any bibles ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-bible-iduskbn0gt2ki20140829 ) and be careful about being '' [ obscene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miller_test ) '' . 
  you 're in a thread about someone being arrested for burning a koran and are mentioning the us , a nation in which [ burning bibles ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-bible-iduskbn0gt2ki20140829 ) can get you arrested and in which being '' [ obscene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miller_test ) '' can be a cause for limiting speech . 
  restricting free speech is necessary in every single developed society . 
  the question is where exactly to draw the line . 
  * personally * to me the case at hand ( assuming that 's * literally * the full story , would n't be the first time that it is n't ) is one where calling it some form of hate speech is completely out of proportion . 
  i do n't see incitement or anything similar at all . 
  to me it 's pretty much a textbook case of something that blasphemy laws used to cover and which is why nations get rid of them . 
   while the rafale now has speaking of which , french plane that cool kids can buy instead of the f-35 when ? 
   i mean idiocracy came to usa erhm ... the plot of idiocracy is about the most intelligent person on earth being told to fix what 's going wrong by the president of the us . 
  i do n't think that 's what we 're currently witnessing . 
  it 's wrong as a generic `` they never used gas bombs '' , even [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_warfare#nazi_germany ) gives a reasonable overview . 
  tl ; dr : * hitler himself was gassed in ww1 . 
  * fear of allied retaliation who had much larger stockpiles than the germans . 
  * the nazis never figured out how to make gasmasks for horses which made it useless under most conditions . 
  * 3000 russians were gassed in tunnels by nazis in 1942 in crimea . 
  op please . 
  `` you never fail to a * may * ze me ! '', 
   this adds up , especially when you take birthrates into accont . 
  you do realize that birthrates are n't some racial or genetic attribute but tied to education , medical availability and economic factors , right ? 
  that 's why birthrates in lots of ` developing ' countries recently dropped so massively ( bangladesh is a great example here ) compared to when european nations had the exact same issues - because other nations can help accelerate this process by providing assistance . 
  there 's also [ this tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/theresa_may/status/865855578454806529 ) :  if i lose just six seats i will lose this election and jeremy corbyn will be sitting down to negotiate with europe this is where one of them goes `` we do n't have a mandate let 's rethink brexit '' and everyone collectively slams their heads into their desks . 
   just look at hollande : the dude started his 5 years one way and because it did n't work made a 180 degree u-turn and went where nobody expected him to go . 
  hmm ... the way i understood it to do that kind of thing he still needs a majority in the assembl\u00e9e nationale , so is n't that still a mandate to do this ? 
  or did he simply change where that majority came from ? 
  i 'm not very well informed here , but it 's my understanding the the french idea is that if the president goes against the general assembly then they 're pushing the pm as a check/balance for exactly that case . 
  ____________ as for the comparison to germany our by far most important instrument for these scenarios are [ constructive votes of no confidence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constructive_vote_of_no_confidence ) . 
  the idea is that if the chancellor is not supported by a majority in parliament then 1/4th of the members can initiate a secret vote for a new chancellor . 
  if 50 % + support the current one the vote fails . 
  what makes it * constructive * is that this motion also has no effect if parliament ca n't agree on a different candidate . 
  that 's the basic idea to prevent the same kind of gridlock we also had with our parliamentary system in the past . 
  there 's also the [ vote de confiance ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/vote_de_confiance ) ( which amusingly has no english speaking article ) where the chancellor can approach parliament with a similar proposal . 
  this can be used to ` force ' his coalition to work together towards a certain goal since it can be combined with a specific motion - that 's how for example our center-left/green government agreed to the war in afghanistan - but it can also be used to trigger new elections when the government becomes incapable of acting .
