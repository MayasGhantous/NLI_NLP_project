  from my perspective those elements , while they sometimes cause bad stuff against the will of the public ( e.g. 
  afghanistan war ) , are probably some of the best we came up with regarding gridlock and similar issues . 
  in terms of how much power the effective leader has ... 
  i 'm not sure if it makes a massive difference in some points . 
  while we e.g. 
  keep as much power as possible away from our chancellor some of those powers ( e.g. 
  commanding the military ) go back to him/her in the case of an emergency situation . 
  that was pushed through in the 70s against quite a bit of opposition however . 
   is n't that the job of the german voters ? 
  i really do n't think the eu should prescribe for every member state how they can finance their roads . 
  in some cases from my experience that 's not how it works out in practice . 
  in this case for example we 're talking about a law change that is pushed through by both major parties quickly and rather short-term before the election that will enable privatization in the future . 
  this toll introduction that 's meant to come in parallel is something that is projected to cost tax payers money ( !! ), 
  since it costs way too much to implement compared to the projected income from it . 
  - but it 's also an incentive for companies to agree to take over a project like this in the future . 
  in a nutshell it boils down to something that is publicly owned and funded being opened up for privatization . 
  since we 're still talking about infrastructure however those companies will have an incentive to make money but if they fail they 'd still have to be bought out . 
  suddenly the tax payer ends up paying multiple times for his infrastructure . 
  it 's less about prescribing members how they can finance their roads , it 's about ( hopefully ) preventing a member from ` financing ' their roads with a scheme that is more expensive than the current one and can * only * be sold politically because of adding `` do n't worry , we 'll lower car taxes for germans ( for a while ! ) '', 
  - if that that rather nonsensical portion can be stopped then hopefully more of the entire plan falls apart . 
  ** this is being sold as a toll exclusively for non-germans but has completely different intentions than getting money into the system . 
  ** _______ in 2005 we had a similar scenario with the [ nord stream pipelines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#gazprom ) where something was pushed through short-term , against public interest , and potentially with quite a bit of corruption involved . 
  these things are spots where voters are pretty much completely powerless to interfere . 
  voting the people responsible out of office ( which happened in that case due to primarily other reasons ) does n't change the damage that 's already been done . 
  a recent example of the eu stepping in is for example the financing of the berlin airport . 
  here , after years and years of money being wasted the eu-commission set a maximum of public funds that can be allocated in the future . 
  [ [ source ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-in-berlin-eu-begrenzt-ber-kosten-auf-6-5-milliarden-euro/12728266.html ) in german ] - if for , whatever reason , multiple political groups align their interest against that of the citizens then the eu is a pretty decent organization since it allows citizens another level of arbitration . 
  that 's also the background of why we have quite a few politicians around who hate the eu and who try do do the `` look how they stopped us who would never act against public interest from doing something ?!, 
  our sovereignty ... ! '', 
  made me pretty damn glad to see that to be honest , this is the kind of spot where germany or more specifically german citizens need the eu and/or other countries to keep an eye on our politicians . 
  the recent constitutional change that enables privatization of highways in the future is in the same vein pretty much . 
  on top of all that our csu is not exactly a well-liked party for many , many various reasons - this thing is their pet-project and an egotrip to show how relevant they are on a federal level more than anything else . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fzu78/austria_ready_to_take_german_toll_road_plan_to/dimmlo2/ ) and [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fzu78/austria_ready_to_take_german_toll_road_plan_to/dimjlua/ ) post explain this context rather well overall . 
   if i had to choose a system , i guess i 'd go for the german one . 
  but i bet it has its flaws as well . 
  honestly , from my personal perspective , the way the french handle their things currently seems pretty decent as well . 
  i think past a certain point in any given system you 're just weighing multiple specific things where none of them is really perfect . 
  basically all spots i can think of that i consider questionable about the german system are like that : they have flaws but it 's incredibly hard to think of ways to solve these situations better in practice . 
  what are the specific spots that the french left sees as something that * has * to be reformed and why ? 
  sorry that i sounded a bit harsh , your post came across as the '' ... and then the eu fucked everything up !, 
  '' - trope to me . 
  did n't mean to be mean . 
   it makes it look like you are disagreeing when you are not . 
  you are being more precise . 
  we 're obviously in semantics now but i * am * disagreeing since his initial comment presented two false statements : 1 )  italy was protecting the european border with their mare nostrum operation . 
  2 )  response from the eu was to start frontex , which was less effective , had less boats and less funds . 
  statement 1 ) is , as your source points out , incorrect . 
  it was about `` safeguarding human live '' and `` bringing justice to smugglers/traffickers '' . 
  it was by no means about * protecting the borders * in the sense of preventing people from getting in . 
  statement 2 ) now makes it seem as if mare nostrum protected borders and the eu response was less effective in this task . 
  but in reality [ operation triton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_triton ) was about border security , operated closer to the italian coast , resulted in less refugees coming in than under mare nostrum and resulted in more deaths at sea . 
  his narrative overall ( might as well [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6frnx4/eu_budget_giving_and_receiving_of_gni_2015/dikljrd/ ) the comment again so i can save you a click ) is `` italy had a great border protection program and then the eu started this other program that was less effective '' . 
  in reality italy had a primarily search and rescue operation going and then the eu program started which was cheaper and * more effective * . 
  ... does that make a bit more sense now ? 
   the syrian civil war has nothing to do with iraq or afghanistan . 
  your own source just argued against that :  many islamist movements were also strongly opposed to the assads ' rule . 
  part of those `` many islamist movements '' were some of the [ hundreds of thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-ba'athification#impact ) who went unemployed after the war in iraq and got excluded from the political process . 
  that 's why the roots of the [ islamic state in iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq ) go back to roughly that timeframe . 
  in a nutshell , if we acknowledge that isis plays a fundamental part in the syrian civil war , then the war in iraq specifically does play a sizable role here since that 's where this group originated from . 
  because he claims that mare nostrum was a border protection operation ( it was n't , it was [ s&r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_mare_nostrum ) ) and that `` frontex was less effective '' - here he is referring to operation triton which reduced amount of refugees coming in and caused increased deaths at sea - mostly because * that * was an actual border protection operation . 
   if anything , the second generation in western countries seems to be way more troublesome than the first one . 
  that 's a rather bold claim since to my understanding this * vastly * differs between countries and subgroups . 
  [ the uk ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1540895/young-british-muslims-getting-more-radical.html ) for example has , in contrast to basically everyone else , rather shocking numbers overall in terms of how radical 2nd and 3rd gen turns out in comparison to 1st gen. 
  note that here the prime factors are the usual suspects : social isolation , weak bonds to family & friends , depression . 
  those with strong social bonds are overall those who condemn terrorism the most . 
  [ in the us ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/13/second-generation-americans-proving-most-fruitful-/ ) 1st generation is not seen as an issue ( since they stick to values from their parent culture ) and 3rd generation is not seen as an issue ( since they 're mostly american ) while specifically the 2nd generation is seen as the one most prone to risk . 
  when we look at [ german turks ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2fjunge-deutsch-tuerken-halten-sich-fuer-religioeser-als-die-alten-a-1097936.html ) another slightly weird situation shows : 2nd +3 rd gen describes themselves as more religious but goes to mosques less , prays less and has overall less radical views . 
  the big issue here is that despite 90 % overall saying they 're happy to live in germany over 50 % see themselves as 2nd class citizens and also do n't feel like they belong to mainstream german culture despite trying to fit in . 
  _______ integration is a two-way street overall and whatever the uk is doing it 's massively , massively counterproductive - especially compared to similar groups in germany or the us . 
  i 'd phrase it a bit less drastic but overall i completely agree . 
  if the distribution is done to a reasonable standard ( respect family ties/units , potential language skills etc. ), 
  then people staying where they were assigned to until the asylum situation changes should be the most basic level of compliance and cooperation that i would expect in this scenario . 
  people who disregard that despite the circumstances being made clear to them are very clearly in the `` economic '' camp . 
  in most cases straight up deportation for such a violation wo n't be possible to my knowledge since we still might be talking about active war zones but at the very least those should be the absolute first people in line to go - kinda depends on how you agree on judging that kind of violation . 
   response from the eu was to start frontex , which was less effective , had less boats and less funds . 
  not sure why this is highly upvoted , because the [ last time i looked into this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bufek/eu_plan_to_relocate_160000_refugees_from_italy/dhq2bmx/ ) mare nostrum was a * rescue operation * while operation triton is primarily a voluntary border security operation . 
  voluntary because mare nostrum became too expensive for italy and the eu as a whole could n't agree how to help out . 
  ** as a direct result of operation triton the amount of incoming refugees via the mediterranean route went down and deaths at sea went up by 1600 % . 
  that 's not what we 're talking about here though . 
  may :  and i mean doing more to restrict the freedom and the movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they present a threat , but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court . 
  she 's saying this is ** not ** about law enforcement but about `` not having enough evidence to prosecute them in court '' - so either she 's full of shit or openly supporting isis is completely legal in the uk as of now . 
  unless i 'm missing something i do n't see any other options for such a statement . 
  but in this case the argument coming from may is that these people ca n't be locked up without infringing on due process , not that law enforcement is overworked or anything similar . 
  that 's what i 'm not understanding specifically . 
  does the uk not have laws against aiding terrorist organizations ? 
  we 're talking about * literal * open isis supporters here , nothing even remotely controversial . 
   what about journalists researching isis or religious scholars ? 
  germany deals with that shit since * decades * regarding national-socialist content and it works well enough . 
  yet we still have university courses about it and journalists working through history in great detail . 
  the difference is that when talking about nazi propaganda in public you have to inform the responsible government agency and then a bunch of people from that respective agency chill together with the neonazis in your seminar . 
  and yes , the people know each other personally in a lot of cases which does make for a bit awkward situations at times . 
  in practice it 's really not that big of a deal since in the vast majority of cases you can tell what the overall narrative conveys . 
  1 ) `` anti-propaganda laws '' ( which this would likely fall under ) are usually about distribution . 
  if you distribute in a non-educational context , that brings you into conflict with the law here . 
  ** owning ** propaganda without distributing it is something that you have be extremely careful about regulating , if at all . 
  2 ) spreading propaganda is a different thing from associating/conspiring with known terrorists which is where most of the issues are to my understanding . 
  can your or someone else from the uk walk me through why the following is not an option : 1 ) the is and associated groups are terrorist organisations . 
  2 ) conspiring with known terrorists and/or glorifying them , at least to my knowledge , is a rather easy thing to declare a crime ( is this not the case already in the uk ? ), 
  3 ) if there 's evidence for conspiring and/or glorifying them , engaging in propaganda for them etc. 
  - bring it in front of a court , sentence them , done .
