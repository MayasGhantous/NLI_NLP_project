  should n't `` enough evidence to know they present a threat '' start of this exact legal chain ? 
  why does n't it ? 
  what exactly am i missing ? 
   if german right-wingers kill germans , how does it relate to this issue at hand ? 
  the issue at hand is that people try to push the view that islamist violence is some massive issue in germany . 
  i consider every person harmed by right-wing extremism just as much of an issue as every person harmed by religious - or left-wing extremism . 
  when we compare them we will find that islamic violence absolutely pales in every single category . 
   i looked at the list after 2000 , and large part of the names sound german to me . 
  a big part of what makes people despise islamist terrorism as we know it is the indiscriminate nature of it . 
  people kill because of their ideology with no real goal beyond carnage because of their ideology . 
  turns out , right-wing violence is just as broad and that 's part of the reason why official numbers are massively criticized : only the absolutely most obvious and clear cases where a judge said `` yup , this was right-wing motivated '' are counted if you ask the german government . 
  a prime case here is [ nihat yusufo\u011flu ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nihat_yusufo%c4%9flu ) ( reasonable google translate [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fnihat_yusufo%25c4%259flu ) ) . 
  the case happened in 1990 and is not recognized as a right-wing hatecrime by the german government . 
  his murder was the leader of a local right-wing association , the association was under surveillance , they shouted anti-turkish right-wing at them and they threatened them for weeks before the murder happened . 
  the judge ruled that it was manslaughter and not motivated by right-wing ideologies , hence , up to this day , it was never officially recognized as such . 
  __________ overall you can find a translation of the entire list [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zeit.de%2fgesellschaft%2fzeitgeschehen%2f2010-09%2ftodesopfer-rechte-gewalt%2fkomplettansicht ) , you 'll have to scroll a bit to get to the year 2000 and i had to refresh it twice to get it to actually translate all the way , not sure what 's up with that . 
  from foreigners over people looking foreign , punks , homeless people , mentally or physically disabled , policemen , everything is included . 
  overall in germany if i 'm part of the general population and we look at averages and death count there 's a factor 10 in favor of being killed by right-wing extremists . 
  when it comes to all crime a recent [ inquiry in one state ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/image/24675762/max/600/450/94105dcecaa23ec196043bb6fc04ff22/is/kriminalitaet-sa.jpg ) revealed a factor of 100 if we compare right-wing crimes specifically to crime committed by ** all non-germans ** . 
  if i 'm part of * any * minority then this becomes an even bigger issue since so far the only islamist attack that resulted in citizens dying was completely indiscriminate . 
  yes , this is ( most likely - since i do n't know their numbers for other politically motivated crimes ) in contrary to france , the uk and spain and germany can call herself lucky that so far it has n't escalated to this level . 
  yes , it 's still a massive issue which needs to be addressed * before * it actually escalates . 
  but for now , in terms of victims and crimes committed , it 's absolutely minor compared to any other form of political violence . 
  pretending otherwise is simply dishonest as hell . 
   and almost always mankind struggling against its very nature , to a degree while i do think you 're right here so are lots of other things we learned how to deal with to figure out functioning societies . 
  taking things from others because you 're stronger for example was * probably * the norm for a longer time than it was n't in human history . 
  i think the key step here is learning to recognize when our own biases kick in . 
  sure i do have people with views where i think that the world would be better if they 'd just vanish - but as long as they 're not making calls to violence or hatred , that view of mine has to be absolutely irrelevant . 
  i 'm also very deep in the ( pretty damn german i must admit ) `` tolerance for everything , except the intolerant '' - mindset in general . 
  i think once you have such a specific and general view of ethics you have a good starting point to be fair and `` just '' , even against people you have a fundamental dislike against . 
  if i try to understand that you with your cultural background would draw a different line here than me with my background then i can probably learn some things from your view , just like you will be able to learn from mine . 
  but for * that * to be possible we both need strong identities that do n't define their self-worth from their passport or place of birth and can look at these things detached and with less emotional connections which opens another can of worms . 
  the only way i can see in the long run is to keep trying to make things work and cooperate with whoever is willing to do so . 
  yup , that 's why cooperation and learning how to get along with each other is pretty much the only winning strategy . 
  for everyone . 
  tho judging by the votes in this chain ten hours later the people who prefer not to get along do seem to be more influential . 
  feel free to argue for a `` no political statements '' - rule when it comes to recent events before you compare me to holocaust deniers . 
  then no one would have been able to make from reality detached statements and i would n't have felt the need to reply to bring a more rational and fact-based view to the table . 
  but even in the case that i contributed nothing at all : your contribution that merely complains about my contribution is probably a tier lower still . 
   if he meant that islamic terrorists are active in europe recently , why would you even argue against it . 
  because , unlike what the initial poster implied , they 're a minuscule issue in germany compared to right-wing terrorism . 
  unwanted in at least in my society . 
  the second an islamist party shows up i 'll be in favor of prohibiting them too because neither is compatible with the exact same fundamental values . 
   to misrepresent the fact rapes are up mind quoting me where you believe i made such a claim ? 
  * absolute numbers are up . 
  * rates are down . 
  both of these statements are true and they show a positive development . 
  if absolute cases would go down while rates increase then that 'd be a bad development because it shows that on average individuals are more likely to commit crime . 
  the rate is more crucial than the absolute number since it tells us that individuals are ** now less criminal than two years ago ** . 
  that 's why we use ** rate ** in comparisons and not an absolute number . 
  when someone points out that `` germany has been disproportionally hit with terrorist attacks recently '' as if ideological violence is something new or islamist-specific and someone else that rapes are another topic where this got worse recently while both of it is completely false and not based on reality then yes , that 's an issue that needs to be addressed . 
   is it really that hard to say some foreign cultures cause problems , without naming all of our own sins ? 
  i have no problem saying that islamists cause issues and that it needs to be addressed . 
  but saying that they cause more issues than e.g. 
  right-wing attacks who caused deaths and injuries by an easy factor 10 in comparison , * that * is insensitive . 
   the fact of the matter is citation needed . 
   only increasing by almost double in two years is n't the success story you think it is ... you do understand that if the rate increases by 70 % but the population by 200 % then * rates * went down rather massively , correct ? 
  thanks for showing up here . 
   that said , it may be that i still omitted a significant number of right wing attacks . 
  i 'll see what sort of attacks were listed in the wikipedia article but not rwtvd . 
  i think that 's overall a bit of a methodology issue in general . 
  if we 're exclusively looking at terrorism in the sense of people killed to incite terror or fear then i think your graph is * probably * close and reasonable . 
  on the other hand it feels a bit intellectually dishonest if we exclude every single person that was killed because of e.g. 
  right-wing ideologies but keep those who were killed because of religious ideologies . 
  going through [ this list here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/todesopfer_rechtsextremer_gewalt_in_der_bundesrepublik_deutschland\\#gesamtliste ) that becomes messy quickly however , especially because official numbers and commonly accepted numbers differ from each other by almost factor 2 . 
  basically if we conclude that every person killed because of a religious background = terrorism i think we need to conclude that for all involved groups . 
  that suddenly would include things like [ this case ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/marinus_sch%c3%b6berl ) ( murdered by youth associated with right-wing violence in parts because he ` looked like a jew ' ) or [ this homeless guy ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/dieter_manzke ) who was killed because `` homeless people do n't deserve to live '' according to the perpetrators ideology . 
  if these things were done by muslims i 'd be pretty sure we 'd include them as islamist terrorism and rightfully so . 
  or , if you 're really sneaky , you keep this list as it is and make a different graph that lists victims of political or religious violence . 
  that would still include all the victims of terrorism but * also * all the more ` random ' things that are smaller . 
  - if there are even good sources for this for non-native speakers . 
  _____ in a nutshell , it feels weird seeing this graph used by people to point out how violent and dangerous islam is compared to other sources of violent ideologies when , for example in germany , deaths due to right-wing ideologies are higher by a factor of at least 10 since the year 2000 . 
    the slaughter in ukraine by the putin regime should not be forgotten neither should their terror attack on the airplane . 
   no czech harmed . 
  irrelevant . 
  ... what ? 
  so you 're saying russia annexing parts of ukraine is irrelevant to the entire eu because no eu citizens were harmed ? 
  gee , let 's get rid of those sanctions then . 
  to be fair you 're posting this in a thread where the op lists that 32 % of czechs view putin favorably . 
  minority , sure . 
  but a pretty sizable one nevertheless . 
  sure , [ let 's look at those ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/panorama/sind-fluechtlinge-haeufiger-sexualstraftaeter-article19307601.html ) . 
  in 2016 sexual crimes with at least one refugee playing a part went up by 77 % compared to 2014 . 
  during the same timeframe the amount of people in that category increase threefold which means that overall the rate of sexual assault committed by migrants * decreased in the last two years * . 
  it 's better now than it was before , not worse . 
  on a national level rapes went down by 20 % over the last ten years . 
  sexual assaults are a total of 1.1 % of the offenses committed by refugees . 
  90-95 % of suspects in sexually related murders are german . 
  in 2016 out of 11 total cases one suspect was foreign . 
   no , it 's actually just because someone spray painting a refugee center i already excluded all propaganda related crimes . 
  if i did n't then we would be looking at 1800 total crimes committed against foreigners in 2016 in germany alone . 
  not comparable ? 
  we have multiple failed right-wing bombing attempts , multiple attempts to burn down people in their homes . 
  a kid shooting others in a rampage in parts due to being convinced by right-wing propaganda . 
  all of that compared to * one * attack where a well-known refugee that should have been deported months ago came through . 
  germany has literally * decades * of right-wing terrorism and propaganda and way over hundred deaths behind it . 
  they 're not a new trend either , but they 're now hiding behind `` but those migrants '' to commit violence and people like you are excusing it by pretending it 's not comparable or an issue at all . 
  where our lists have ~ 8000 people related to salafist movements on them they also have ~ 30000 right wing extremists or for example ~ 20000 followers of the grey wolves . 
   here is the reality which you 're struggling to ignore : https://i.redd.it/msx7h8f8411z.png with all due respect to / u/udzu who posted this [ a few days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6emhad/terrorism_deaths_in_western_europe_2000may_2017_oc/ ) that graph is extremely misleading in this context . 
  to begin with the most [ well known graphs ] ( http://www.datagraver.com/case/islamic-terrorism-in-western-europe ) on this issue completely disagree with it both in number and overall distribution .
