  it most likely was never intended for someone like you who tries to use it as evidence that religious violence is more common than right-wing violence since at least in germany that is completely and massively incorrect . 
  second , i do n't know his sources directly but for example the most reputable non-profit on this issue in [ germany alone ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/todesopfer_rechtsextremer_gewalt_in_der_bundesrepublik_deutschland ) lists 74 deaths due to right-wing extremism since the year 2000 . 
  what i * assume * happened was that a very narrow definition of terrorism was applied that * maybe * only focuses on the most prominent examples like the [ nsu murders ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground_murders ) . 
  if we count any single death by anyone claiming a religious background then we need to count every single death by anyone claiming a right-wing background . 
  that 's how you figure out who is responsible for what amount of violence without spinning it into an agenda . 
  ________  finally , it 's actually irrelevant who 's doing the violence . 
  indeed . 
  every single individual that calls for or commits violence in any way shape or form is an issue for society , whether they 're politically left , right , religious or not religious . 
  ** and that 's why we ca n't reduce it to deaths by the most spectacular attacks that everybody drools about . 
  ** - we ca n't ignore that right-wing violence exploded like never before and pretend it 's just about evil religious people . 
  ** the by far biggest issue in germany is just that : radical right-wing violence , like it has been for decades . 
  ** is islamist terrorism an issue as well that needs to be addressed ? 
  of course it is . 
  but it is in no way shape or form the gigantic issue the poster i initially replied to makes it out to be in comparison with violence from other groups . 
  i personally do n't exactly care about who commits violence , every individual who does is an issue for a society . 
  dude , we 're fucking terrible at patterns . 
  we 're great at * finding * them and justifying them , but we 're terrible at finding good ones that are in line with reality , especially when it comes to emotional/irrational topics . 
   i just want theresa may or whoever the london mayor to come out and give a solution or plan . 
  i do n't think a `` final solution '' exists that we can put together while also sticking to the very values that make our societies those who the entire world looks up to in terms of wealth and overall well-being . 
  overall the majority in our society agrees that killing each other is bad , yet we could never come up with a solution that prevented people murdering each other . 
  violent crime , robberies , even terrorism and the most disgusting things imaginable all belong to our lives and we deal with them by being distanced , letting people not involved make the calls and by trying to separate guilty from not guilty * after * they did things against our codes of law . 
  sure , we can * reduce * these things by legislating against extremists who preach violence , we can * reduce * them by stricter control of immigration or by more surveillance against all citizens . 
  we can reduce them by trying to ensure as much as possible that all of our citizens are happy , integrated and are living fulfilled lives . 
  we could also reduce them by mass deporting `` risk groups '' or by putting them in camps and letting them rot there , but then we 'd have to do the same with * all * risk groups for all kinds of violence and i do n't think you or me would want to live in such a society . 
  but no matter how extreme our reactions will be : this will never go away . 
  and even if religion goes away people will find other outlets . 
  crimes , even the most heinous and vile ones , were always a part of humanity and they will be for the foreseeable future . 
  we need to learn how to deal with it , like we learned how to deal with any other violent outlet . 
  by using it to unite * everyone * who is fundamentally against violence and by excluding everyone who is . 
  judge people by the content of their character , their actions and nothing else . 
  that 's the best every single one of us can do to contribute . 
   which totally freaks me out why ? 
  the things i and most likely you already normalized are things for which big headlines wo n't even reach us anymore , despite them being such massive issues overall . 
  you wo n't hear about how germany had ~ 450 + refugees injured due to right-wing attacks in 2016 , because it 's not news . 
  you wo n't hear about our right-wing [ violent crime ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-09/rechtsextremismus-gewalt-anstieg-deutschland-neonazis-fremdenfeindlichkeit-fluechtlinge ) ( google translate [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zeit.de%2fgesellschaft%2fzeitgeschehen%2f2016-09%2frechtsextremismus-gewalt-anstieg-deutschland-neonazis-fremdenfeindlichkeit-fluechtlinge ) ) being up by 44 % until may 2016 and having doubled over the entire year . 
  that does n't show up on / r/europe or bbc news feeds or similar sources . 
  it 's not news , it does n't generate income . 
  the reason * this * is prominent is because it aims to be more prominent than what we 're used to , can spread quicker than what we 're used to and because it 's ` new ' and ` foreign ' . 
  because it in some cases looks more like a threat from outside rather than all the inside threats we 're used to . 
  because it can be politicized and used to gain or lose votes if you manage to paint other groups as responsible for being the bad guys . 
  it feeds on fear , emotional knee-jerk reactions and effective propaganda . 
  normalizing it will allow all of us to make more educated and more efficient decisions on how to * actually * combat these things on a reasonable and sustainable level . 
  it 's what makes us immune to propaganda from multiple sides and hence also allows our elected officials to become more efficient in dealing with it . 
  violence , in any way shape or form , should never be the norm in our societies and all of us participating in them should strive to combat it wherever it comes from and whoever it is directed towards . 
  but we * do * need that normalized and at least to some degree detached perspective to do what 's needed and to do what 's right by our core values . 
  ** specifically ** in the [ context of the refugee crisis ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/french-presidential-candidate-macron-praises-merkels-refugee-policy/a-36971293 ) , not as a general policy where such an approach was never even on the table . 
  yeah , i 'm totally fine with segregating any * individual * with these tendencies when they manifest in actual criminal activity . 
  race , cultural background , color of skin , religion , right , left , sexuality , gender , christian , islamist , muslim and all the other higher tier categories - i give no fucks about because that to me is one of the most fundamental western democratic values in modern history . 
  judging by the content of their character and all that . 
  i got ta admit that i do admire your optimism and hope you 're right in the end . 
  as a complete laymen on this issue the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_positions_on_the_nature_of_hamas ) for the topic suggests this is more debated than i initially assumed . 
  it sounds like * some * nations , including britain up to now , argue that hamas as a whole is not a terrorist organisation and only parts that belong to them need to be treated as such . 
  based on that clip it * sounds * like corbyn is in favor of that position being continued . 
  a few others ( china , turkey , russia ) go further and call them completely legitimate . 
  without further information i would ** assume ** the british have legitimate reasons for their stance even before corbyn being in the picture and he 's in favor of continuing that stance . 
  suddenly sounds a lot less controversial than a sudden shift in ideology of especially young people due to brainwashing . 
  i do n't believe in segregating populations based on arbitrary categories because all of them have minorities within them that want to actively start a war with other groups . 
   like germany ? 
  uh ... what ? 
  in 2016 germany had the berlin truck attack ( first time any german citizens died on german soil due to islamist terror ) and 4 minor cases where the attacker died when it comes to islamist terrorism . 
  yes , this does represent an increase overall . 
  we also had a ( non-religious/right-wing/lone wolf ) shoot ten people , 57 cases of arson and 9 cases of explosives being used against refugee homes in the first three quarters alone and between 470 and 560 refugees injured in 2016 ( up from 195 in 2015 ) depending on which source you trust . 
  ** this is exclusively about crimes against refugees ** . 
  in [ this graph ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/graph/png/fl%c3%bcchtlingsfeindliche_angriffe_in_der_bundesrepublik_deutschland/0/e2402cd313042345b8518547282cddeac2a5abf5.png ) the important figure is blue , which shows violent attacks against refugee homes per quarter . 
  green is the total number of criminal offences against them . 
  it 's just that no one internationally gives a fuck about any of the above because it 's just right-wing terrorism and we 're used to it . 
   150 years ? 
  probably a global connected civilisation with a common global culture . 
  depends . 
  either one group decides `` lol we 're better than everyone else '' and eliminates everyone else , we somehow learn to get along or we wipe out humanity because the first viewpoint escalated . 
  so you 're in favor of getting rid of all snakes and not just those who are venomous ? 
  might as well nuke the planet at that point , that 's the only way to be sure we get all the venomous humans . 
    it could even mean that our methods of determining who `` exhibits problematic behavior '' are biased . 
   how on earth are they `` biased '' ? 
  immigrants and their descendants are statistically much , much more likely to turn out to be terrorists . 
  what i mean by bias is that we ca n't presume that they 're more likely to be terrorists * because they 're immigrants * because we 're physically incapable of removing biases from that equation . 
  we ca n't ignore socio-economic status , language , integration , reactions from the population and all these things and focus exclusively on them being migrants . 
  for example germany is , if i remember correctly , putting 10x as much resources into surveilling islamist terrorists than we do for radical right-wing groups right now . 
  yet the latter group is responsible for more violent crime , more deaths and more cases of arson . 
  in return we 'll proportionally stop more islamist-related crimes while others start spiraling out of control . 
  for example [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/graph/png/fl%c3%bcchtlingsfeindliche_angriffe_in_der_bundesrepublik_deutschland/0/e2402cd313042345b8518547282cddeac2a5abf5.png ) is what right-wing violence against refugee homes looked like per quarter in 2015/2016 . 
  blue is the important column here that only counts violent attacks , green is the amount that includes propaganda offenses which can be a bit tricky in germany specifically . 
  overall we have a * slight * increase in islamic violence ( the berlin truck attack was the first one with civilian german deaths ever , also not committed by someone related to migration ) and a ** massive ** increase in right-wing violence that came before that attack even . 
  we ca n't vilify migrants and their descendants when our own population becomes more violent than ever before . 
  in one state ( sachsen-anhalt ) our right-wing party asked for an official inquiry in who commits which crimes , [ after eliminating propaganda crimes ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/image/24675762/max/600/450/94105dcecaa23ec196043bb6fc04ff22/is/kriminalitaet-sa.jpg ) again we 're at 438 from right , 229 from left and 15 ( !! ), 
  from non-germans . 
   i have no idea what this is but gray wolves are not salafists lol . 
  they probably got introduced to islam by gray wolves and then entered salafism . 
  according to this [ press briefing ] ( https://www.zdf.de/zdf/zdfportal/blob/38601106/1/data.pdf ) i could find we have evidence to the contrary . 
  this both claims of networking between grey wolves members and salafist groups and that grey wolves youthgroups are more and more religiously oriented . 
  one ex-member claims that they always met in mosques and he was forced to pray despite him and his parents being non-religious . 
  the imam of that mosque also supposedly was the leader of the local grey wolves group . 
  the german lka ( crime investigation ) considers grey wolves more dangerous than islamists even though there is some overlap . 
  idea being that the population is more sensitive to islamists which allows groups like the grey wolves to reach more people without hindrance . 
  they presume ~ 8000 salafist followers and ~ 20000 grey wolves followers . 
  it 's a bit funny that that 's precisely what i was just referring to , just from another direction . 
  i never heard about these numbers before - but that 's because of the massive focus on islamists with pretty much no focus on other groups that exist in larger numbers but are just as radical . 
   we are talking about islamic terrorism here . 
  not violence as a whole . 
  iirc immigrants are also more involved in other forms of crime too , though .
