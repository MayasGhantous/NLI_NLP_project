  same issue here : they 're more in prison for other forms of crimes , very massively even , but we ca n't actually say that 's because they commit more crime or are more criminal in general . 
  it 's a bit like in the us where we ca n't take incarceration rates of black people and assume that black people are more criminal just because of those rats . 
  `` they '' in this case means mostly people from mahgreb-states and the balkans , at least in germany . 
  proportionally those are the biggest issues which was is in parts why so many asylum requests from those areas are denied . 
    but that wo n't make the people who are looking for ideologies that ` allow them ' to commit these or similar crimes go away . 
  it wo n't prevent people from finding their favorite left , right or islamic hate groups online , radicalizing and joining their cause . 
   most people are n't looking for groups that will make them commit acts of terror . 
  they just want to live their lives . 
  they commit acts of terror because they see it as a religious duty , and think that they will be rewarded for it in the afterlife . 
  just 2016 we had a non-religious guy who shot ten people and another non-religious guy who tried to blow up a fucking football team . 
  * both * cases in which especially english speaking media played it up as islamism because of circumstantial evidence early on . 
  i agree , * most * people just want to live their lives . 
  but that 's true for pretty much every human being on earth . 
  compare the number of those who commit acts of terror the to the general population and even in the worst places on earth they will be a massive minority . 
   there are numerous places in the world that suffer from poverty and directionlessness . 
  still , no group produces as much terrorists as muslims . 
  islam is the problem and it needs a reform . 
  i agree that it needs a reform ( and it does n't help that actual great reformers are slammed with headlines such as [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1op3qra.png ) on a frequent basis despite not being true ) . 
  but i * do * think , based on all the numbers i 've shown you so far , that the reason islam produces the most terrorism is because it has the best pr , all across the world . 
  that 's why it 's such a ` modern ' problem in the west in the first place . 
  we always had people with tendencies to commit acts of terrorism who acted on them . 
  those people did n't suddenly disappear , a portion of your population will always exist that favors these things . 
  what * did * change is that all groups ( including left and right groups ) are becoming more violent and are more actively bringing those people into their ranks . 
  but only one of them is what the majority publicly focuses on because it 's the most foreign and least known of them all . 
  people who convert and preach or commit violence did n't suddenly become that way because of islam or right-wing propaganda . 
  they had these tendencies before that and simply found an ideology for themselves that let them act it out . 
   yes they are far more criminal that 's not what any data shows . 
  what we ** do ** know is that they 're convicted more often for crimes proportionally . 
  that can be due to them being more criminal because black people commit more crimes , due to biases inherent in the criminal justice system , due to biases in the police system , due to inequalities on an economic and social level . 
  you ca n't make the connection you made with the data available when we ca n't eliminate the other biases effectively . 
   oh no you exactly can . 
  if 20 out of 100 green people exhibit problematic behavior while only 2 out of 100 purple people do so , then yes we can indeed come to the conclusion that green people have a problem . 
  it tells you that green people are * more vulnerable * to the problem . 
  it does n't mean that they 're * responsible because they 're green * . 
  that 's the differentiation i 'm trying to explain first and foremost . 
  it could even mean that our methods of determining who `` exhibits problematic behavior '' are biased . 
  you and me do n't know this and for example our incarceration rates or even the attacks we know about do n't tell us about this . 
  for example , let 's take 2016 in germany . 
  yes , this will be biased since germany has very low amounts of attacks compared to france or the uk but it 's also the only nation where i can find enough information quickly . 
  we had the berlin truck attack ( 12 dead ) and 4 other religious attacks where no one was killed besides the attacker in two of these cases . 
  we had the munich shooting ( non-religious/right-wing/lone wolf ) with ten dead . 
  but we also had more than 60 cases of arson against refugee homes , 9 violations against explosive laws ( both of these categories attributed to right-wing violence ) and 470-560 refugees injured after attacks depending on which source you trust more . 
  ___ based on this there is no pattern to say : `` yup , migrants/kids of migrants '' are the main security issue . 
   of course not . 
  gray wolves are an entirely different branch of the problem caused by immigrants , though . 
  we are talking about jihadists here . 
  fighting salafism can and will reduce most of your jihad problems . 
  could be that it just did n't make it to international media but what i 'm talking about is the so-called [ lohberger brigade ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lohberger_brigade ) , a salafist-jihadist organisation where some founding members radicalized in syria and others with members of the grey wolves . 
  i 'm having trouble finding an english speaking source for this so the best i can offer is the [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2flohberger_brigade ) of the wikipage that at least mentions connections to and admiration for erdogan and the grey wolves . 
   fighting salafism can and will reduce most of your jihad problems . 
  i fully agree there . 
  however , this requires working * with * migrants and others against all forms of radical islam . 
  openly pushing that this is about the kids of migrants and uncontrolled immigration as the major issue is counter productive here . 
  most of these people are on the same side as we are . 
  great random example from a couple of days ago was the guy who was arrested in berlin . 
  his mother in lebanon , his cousin in berlin and syrians half way across of germany all immediately worked together to inform authorities after he acted suspiciously . 
   which is what is expected . 
  are you seriously telling me that native europeans commit as much islamic terror acts as immigrants and their descendants ? 
  i was probably unclear about this . 
  what i 'm getting at is that ` native europeans ' or simply non-religious europeans are also massively involved in violence and terrorism . 
  the munich shooter , the [ nsu guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground_murders ) ( which parts of the press called `` kebap murders '' for years because they just assumed it was done by a turkish mafia ) , all of these go in that direction - islamic terrorism is just a small part of the overall picture . 
  to me the underlying issue is not islamic terrorism specifically and the overall distribution hints that it 's also just a symptom . 
  yes it needs to be addressed , yes salafist preachers need to go and yes funding needs to be cut off . 
  but that wo n't make the people who are looking for ideologies that ` allow them ' to commit these or similar crimes go away . 
  it wo n't prevent people from finding their favorite left , right or islamic hate groups online , radicalizing and joining their cause . 
  that 's what i meant initially . 
  this potential in people to be turned against the state and society itself is what is growing stronger , all across the population . 
  and radicals will keep exploiting that if we do n't find ways to decrease it . 
  you 'd say that , since the incarceration rate says that more black people are in prison , this means in return that they must be more criminal because otherwise they would n't be in prison . 
  we 're using the fact that more of them in prison as a proof that more of them commit crimes . 
  the issue with that view is that the incarceration rate itself can already be built on a bias and not on actual reality . 
  imagine being a policeman who has to control a certain amount of the population for carrying illegal substances . 
  since you `` know '' that black people are more likely to carry illegal substances than white people ( since more of them are in prison for this type of offense ) , all you need to do is control proportionally more black than white people and your statistic sample will be biased . 
  suddenly , even if for example white people would break the law more often , you 'd have changed the sample in such a way that it does n't reflect reality anymore and you will continue to encourage the completely wrong picture of reality . 
  this bias will ** not ** show in a statistic that for example mentions how many % of black people controlled and how many % of white people controlled were doing something against the law ( since this adjusts for distribution in the population naturally ) . 
  it * will * however show in raw numbers and incarceration rates . 
  does that make sense this way or should i go through a small example ?

  there are n't that many embassies that are far out at all . 
  yeah , that took a while . 
  it feels a bit weird since i myself was raised pretty damn pro-american as well and the last 15 years managed to erode most of that view and trust on a fundamental level . 
  i 'd argue that before 9/11 the us was n't * that * bad overall and obama did give some hope that even that time was just a phase and not some massive underlying issue . 
  but now the french can rightfully say `` we * did * try to tell you this since de gaulle ... '' - that does make for one beautiful polandball comic now that i think of it , including a nice little west germany & young brd who do n't * really * want to look strong and would rather stick to the us . 
  well , macron just invited americans to join him in france ... there 's your chance if you have the ability to study or work abroad !, 
  what , why ? 
  it was just a few days ago the us president wanted us to increase our military budget . 
  is this not what he meant ? 
  you just ca n't do anything right these days . . just wait for the `` a new [ \u00c9lys\u00e9e treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lys%c3%a9e_treaty#controversy ) - without any mention of the us '' - headline that 's bound to happen if this course continues . 
  if you 're serious about this , look into making your master somewhere in spain , france or germany for obvious reasons . 
  / r/france , / r/germany or presumably / r/spain are decent places to start as well . 
  i blame age ( and by extension dementia ) more than ego . 
  [ he used to sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksd80-fcaw&amp;t=337s ) rather reasonable without seeming like he forgot what he wanted to say a few words into a sentence . 
  even his classic `` i was talking to x , the biggest company in that field , and they told me y '' - type sentences are completely sensible in that clip . 
  there are videos of him sounding similar all the way into the 2000s . 
  yeah , most of that is fair enough . 
   only problem is that for the two fields i was interested in studying ( computer science or accounting ) , the pay starting out would have only been about 40somethingk for cs , and 30somethingk for accounting there ... whereas at the university i 'm at now it 's 80k for cs and 50k for accounting starting ... denmark for example has ~ 60k $ per year for it bachelors in their first year according to a friend of mine who just started such a job . 
  other questions are usually how much you 'll be in debt after you 're done studying vs in most european countries or what happens when you 're * actually * having issues in terms of sickness or injuries . 
  hell , i know way too many americans where families went broke over something like cancer . 
  overall , from my point of view , in most cases and on average : if i 'm in the top 10 % of earners ( which in germany makes 30 % of the total income - in the us 50 % ) i 'd be better off in the us from a purely selfish perspective as long as nothing major unlucky happens to me or my family . 
  if i 'm not ( or if i do n't fancy supporting such a system ) i 'd rather live in most european nations .
