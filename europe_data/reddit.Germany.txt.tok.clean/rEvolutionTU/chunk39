  `` making more money '' is n't the only thing that determines quality of life . 
  the basic issue is that if we compare averages then someone living in the us will be behind due to how income and wealth is distributed overall and how e.g. 
  cost of healthcare or studying is distributed . 
  it 's simply not as easy as saying `` x in job y makes z more $ in one country so it 's in better shape . '', 
  personally i 'm used to [ duckduckgo bangs ] ( https://duckduckgo.com/bang ) so i usually just go ! qw for most searches but switch to ! g when i want something that i 'm expecting qwant to suck at . 
  bit inconvenient at times but does the trick . 
  i * do * remember the qwant devs stalking around on reddit somewhere , i 'd be curious what they say to the whole verbatim thing . 
   the real concern is that it 's < current year  and we still do n't have a decent search engine . 
   how about c02 emissions per gdp per capita , us has a higher gdp per capita than most european countries , except luxembourg and norway ( who has absurd amounts of hydro lying around ) . 
  i actually ended up [ looking into this earlier ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/en.atm.co2e.pp.gd?view=map ) . 
  that puts the us on par with poland or the czech republic . 
  almost factor 3 difference compared to france ( same as with co2/capita ) and roughly factor 1.5 compared to germany ( also similar difference as with co2/capita ) . 
  what you need to keep in mind for gdp/capita in general when it comes to the us is that what they gain in raw numbers they on average [ lose by income inequality ] ( http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/removing-oligarchs-from-per-capita-gdp ) and by things like universal healthcare compared to european nations . 
   i was shocked upon hearing that even our poorest states are on par with many european countries if you by gdp/capita exclusively , yeah , they 'd be on par . 
  once you look into [ who actually benefits from that wealth ] ( http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/removing-oligarchs-from-per-capita-gdp ) it falls apart rather easily . 
  in a nutshell , once you factor in income inequality and things like healthcare for the average citizen things look rather grim in comparison rather quickly . 
  casual advertisement for www.qwant.com which works well enough for me for the vast majority of cases . 
  apart from that not using facebook is n't that hard . 
  youtube on the other hand tho ... 
   and you do not seem to know that the it in kit simply stands for institute of technology . 
  i do , but that does n't tell people whether someone is studying mathematics , economics or computer science . 
  apart from that that 's cool to know , did not expect that at all . 
  i 'd have expected people talk about `` an der technischen '' or something similar , i can see the appeal of `` kit '' tho . 
  at least that makes pronunciation easy for our american buddy up there . 
  i agree with you that that 's a dumb decision overall , but i do have to admit that it turns into a sensible ( or at least understandable ) one for me given the context of all this . 
  the anti-nuclear movement [ grew massively ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-nuclear_movement_in_germany#chernobyl_disaster ) after chernobyl and formed the basis for our green party that came into power in 1998 and stayed there until 2005 . 
  one of their main goals was getting rid of nuclear energy and pushing renewables at a time where no other country had any real interest in it . 
  at that point in time there was massive support for this in the population and the idea was that instead investing into solar ( scrolling through stats [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_power_in_germany#statistics ) gives you a bit of an idea how massively this was pushed ) was the better choice for a clean future with the hope that other nations can build on this initial investment . 
  in merkels second term ( 2010 ) all this shutting down was going on for years and something that was well established in main-stream german culture . 
  she * still * tried to push for more nuclear energy which was answered by protests that were just as big as the ones back in the 80s after chernobyl . 
  80 % of the population were against completely getting rid of nuclear energy at that point in time . 
  when fukushima happened ( which is where the article you 're quoting comes into play ) merkel and her government made the imo only political sound choice for that scenario : pushing something inevitable onwards that otherwise political opponents would push in the long run anyway . 
  might as well grab some more votes in that case . 
  building up nuclear energy in germany again has been impossible since decades now since the population overall is so massively against it so it 's not like we 'd get more know-how and better reactors just from delaying this move any further . 
  fukushima was just a good enough reason for her to make a change in stance she imo had planned ever since she saw the massive resistance to her trying to make nuclear energy better accepted . 
  _______ now , in 2017 , in retrospect : should have turned off coal back in 1998 and invested into solar and we 'd all be in a better spot most likely . 
  but i do n't feel like i can genuinely blame people for taking this direction instead , especially since it had [ pretty decent support all across the globe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-nuclear_movement ) at the time this whole mess started - and still does :  globally , more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years . 
  you win some , you lose some - at least we pushed renewable energy like crazy . 
  time to figure out how to store energy properly so we can stop looking like idiots compared to the french and get rid of coal . 
  hopefully by that time both being anti-nuclear * and * being anti-coal are viable and sustainable strategies . 
  then we can just claim we were on the right side all along . 
   french politicians have been critical of american politics since de gaulle , at least . 
  it should be noted that at that time it was [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lys%c3%a9e_treaty#controversy ) who stood up for american interests due to an overall loyalty towards them that persisted through the entire 20th century . 
  ever since the war in afghanistan the us has been rapidly using up all that good will they built up for half a century however . 
   i am interested in what merkel has got to say too . 
  at this point in time i 'd expect every single response from these parties to be 100 % in line with each other because interests on this issue are aligned . 
  merkel made her comment the day after the summit while macron was comparatively quiet - now macron made an extremely clear statement while [ merkels government endorsed it ] ( https://twitter.com/regsprecher/status/870381009023488002 ) but did n't add anything specific except for a ( rather low key and a bit more aggressive ) letter from our [ vice chancellor ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/dbqtqbxxkaao7n0.jpg:orig ) that 's in line with the french statement . 
  * personally * , as a german - and you have no idea how weird this feels to say - i feel completely represented by macron on this issue . 
   anyone here study at kit ? 
  just so you 're aware most germans i know do n't use the abbreviation for their university like people in the us usually do . 
  in this case you 'd just say : `` anyone here study in karlsruhe ? 
  / at the university karlsruhe ? '', 
  if you want to be more specific than that it 'd be the norm to mention your faculty on top of it because `` it '' is n't exactly saying much . 
  the [ german press codex ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) comes to mind as pretty much * the * foundation of german press culture . 
  it has officially been around since 1973 in this form . 
  if an outlet goes against these basic guidelines the german press council can call for the outlet to post a public statement counteracting the initial report that needs to be displayed for just as long and just as prominently . 
  in practice this is not enforceable and has lead people to assume that the organ as a whole is a bit of a paper tiger . 
  this criticism is usually called baseless since the vast , vast majority of these public apologies end up posted since most outlets respect the entire thing . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/geruegte_medien.svg/2000px-geruegte_medien.svg.png ) is what the distribution of outlets that got slapped in this way looks like since 1986 - the red one is our equivalent to the sun . 
  ________ it 's overall a voluntary commitment that reflects a common baseline among all press outlets and sets a basic guideline for how the press should have to act to be taken seriously by their readers . 
  i personally love it just for that since you can always go back and ask `` is this reasonable , responsible and sustainable journalism ? '', 
  and have a written document that represents a majority consensus to look at for answers :  these professional ethics give everyone the right to complain about the press . 
  complaints are justified if professional ethics are infringed . 
  _______ it 's also in constant change , for example the latest change ( the above . pdf is still the old version ) was to 12.1 just this march : instead of calling it `` not permissible '' to refer to the religion/ethnicity/etc . 
  of a crime suspect unless it 's specifically in the readers interest to understand backgrounds of the crime the [ new version ] ( http://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/aktuelles/uebersicht_bisherige_richtlinie_neue_richtlinie12.1.pdf ) calls it important that the mentioning of a suspects religion/ethnicity/etc . 
  does not lead to discriminating generalization of groups based on the deeds of the individual and that it should not be mentioned unless there is a reasonable public interest in it . 
  i still feel like he 's too good to be true but he keeps surprising me positively again and again and i 'm extremely glad he 's a thing . 
  man , i 'm still doubtful this guy is actually for real because he sounds too good to be true on these kinds of issues . 
  however , i 'm also extremely grateful that he 's a thing now and am surprised again and again by what i 'm hearing from him . 
  and i 'm also extremely glad that at least on those kinds of issues our government over here is [ 100 % in line ] ( https://twitter.com/regsprecher/status/870381009023488002 ) with the french . 
  i actually * love * this direction . 
  nations like india , bangladesh , other sea countries or a bit later down the road african nations are who we want as our buddies sooner rather than later . 
  it 's only a matter of time until those kind of areas become our fiercest ( and most likely superior in the long run ) competitors if we 're not on the same page . 
  great political investment for the future . 
  note : i 'm also a layman and will hopefully be corrected if i spew incorrect information . 
  that 's one thing where i trust my fellow germans to do so . 
  the [ gini coefficient ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) is overall a tool ( picture on the right , according to the table below the data for germany might be outdated ) that describes how equal wealth is distributed . 
  what germany did ( and what the responsible party is still paying for ) was [ this thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) in the early 2000s . 
  unemployment went down , but a lot of it is in part time and small jobs which did n't * exactly * give the population what you 'd expect from low unemployment : more wealth . 
  hence economic inequality went up rather massively ( note how old the numbers used here are ) :  another sign that economic inequality has risen in germany can be seen in the fact that the number of germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11 % in 2001 , to 12.3 % in 2004 , and about 14 % in 2007 . 
  according to 2007 government statistics , one out of every six children was poor , a post-1960-record , with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  as a bonus note , just to draw attention to it : if you google for german unemployment you usually find numbers like [ this ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/unemployment-rate ) around 4 % . 
  the official german numbers ( which this op references ) are 50 % higher . 
  basically , whenever you see an unemployment statistic that lists germany at 4 % you know it 's one that refers to people ** with any kind of employment ** , even if it 's just a few hours per week and they 're having to receive benefits anyway as a result . 
   if the populace is truly so incompetent that we ca n't handle these sort of things ourselves over the long run then we 're doomed anyways . 
  what you 're referring to is also known as the [ paradox of tolerance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradox_of_tolerance ) and you 're simply arguing the pretty much opposite side of the idea . 
  the `` german '' thought is that if you allow those who do n't play by the rules complete and free access to what we know as freedom or the democratic process then , given enough time and random chance , eventually they will prevail and get rid of these things . 
  the nature of these movements is that they do n't want to play by the same rules as the societies we know and love which is what makes them so fundamentally dangerous . 
  that 's what literally the entirety of the modern german state is built upon : a [ militant democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) that puts defending it 's core values and itself above everything else , including things like freedom of expression . 
  _______ what your hinting at is the opposite view : that , if we assume a competent and pro-democratic population at all times , such a thing is completely unnecessary and hence infringing on fundamental rights for no reason at all . 
  * personally * with my cultural ( german ) background i think that 's too much of an optimistic view . 
  what history taught is that completely normal people like you , me or people we love are capable of the most atrocious things under the ` right ' circumstances . 
  freedom and democracy and all those other things we cherish only need to lose once and they 're done . 
  those who actively go against them only need * one * victory to get rid of them and gain the ability to plunge us back into authoritarian forms of government . 
  and from that historical lesson the german perspective is rather simple : stay vigilant . 
   i say , the law should be changed in a different way , news articles that is in social media or meant for social media , should list it 's sponsors and origin . 
  we already have such a thing , an [ impressum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impressum ) is mandatory in germany to keep that kind of accountability . 
  if i remember the facebook story correctly , here 's the issue : german law says there needs to be someone responsible to deal with issues and complaints and act upon them . 
  facebook gets around what you 're suggesting by saying : '' * we * have an impressum but you ca n't ask us to keep our users responsible for what they 're posting !, 
  we 're just ~ ~ publishing ~ ~ uh . . we 're just showing it around the globe ! '',
