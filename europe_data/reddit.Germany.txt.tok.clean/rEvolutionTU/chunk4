  not too long ago i realized that he basically invented what we do with . gifs in reddit comments : [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-qsnmlpfio ) type of shit . 
  for those unfamiliar he 'd basically have a soundboard in front of him and whenever he pressed one of the buttons you 'd hear that beep and a fitting short clip would play . 
  ____ let 's see if i can dig up some that make sense to non-german speakers : from [ merkel using weak english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htmaselapsk ) , [ politicians flirting with her ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdoxrvkpwis ) over [ yodeling police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdj3-u3xdg0 ) to [ puking moderators ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqngmbsisqg ) , [ puking dogs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmjqy3y7cyq ) , a good old [ `` fuck yourself '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndy_4kbkjcs ) , [ more yodeling police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiv-a2_pjfo ) , [ lagerfeld sigh-ing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yevnrdbe3-m ) , [ news anchors being weird ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpyczteicc ) and [ screaming women ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sp2x21mko ) there 's something for everyone . 
  even a [ badum ... bum !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6jihx7bh-8 ) ... welp , never expected i 'd put together that kind of linklist . 
  also those things were literally called `` nipples '' , so there 's that . 
  ohhh ... that 's much better , cheers !, 
  same !, 
  i know it as `` pain au chocolat '' or `` schokotasche '' / `` schokoteilchen '' ( basically `` chocolate pocket '' / `` chocolate . . thingy '' ) . 
  traditional german smilies look more like this : \u00dc \u00fc \u00d6 \u00f6 xd, 
  ctrl + f `` a38 '' - only find you deep down here and without a german flag . 
  [ that thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi5kwsap9ug ) is definitely one of * the * most well-known running gags in germany . 
  we sometimes * wish * it was this easy . 
  in fact it 's something i have seen personally used to integrate syrian refugees . 
  that video is the only way to understand german bureaucracy . 
  you can literally walk into most administrative offices and when you 're confused by what they 're telling you , you just ask about `` a38 '' and they 'll laugh and explain it to you again with more detail . 
  hmmm ... does it playing out on a multi-dimensional field really change the basic idea or does it just make it more complex ? 
  or did i miss something else ? 
  for example the [ afd ] ( http://blog.tagesschau.de/2016/09/04/struktur-der-afd-waehlerschaft/ ) did n't gain the most votes from the right side of the spectrum ( people seeing themselves to the right of cdu/csu ) but also from fdp/spd and even the left ( who proportionally lost the most votes to them ) . 
  overall the entire strategy seems based on attacking weak points that got exposed by other parties because they moved too far center overall ( spd/cdu ) , stopped being relevant ( fdp ) or failed to achieve the exact same promise as the afd ( die linke ) in the sense of `` we really care about you workers ! '', 
  overall pretty much the same idea applied on a multi-dimensional plane . 
   and the slightly rushed nuclear energy exit i 'm likely biased since i had and have family working in nuclear plants but that topic to this day still bothers me . 
  i * could * understand that it was somewhat needed to accelerate renewables early on but keeping that course ( which results in burning coal and buying power from countries with worse nuclear plants to our east ) never felt * that * genius to me in the first place . 
  it 's a * super * german topic tho . 
   with increasing the migration flows mind adding a source for that , i have n't heard that point . 
   and punishing states that do n't `` share the solidarity '' the concept there is rather simple : we need to address nations that enjoy benefits the eu offers but are n't too interested in the values and ideas that came along when they signed up for it . 
  i do n't recall him using a word like `` punished '' here but i * do * fully agree that 's an unsustainable situation that needs to be addressed . 
   are you saying there are no needy american or french people ? 
  '' [ america first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/america_first_committee ) '' has a slightly different connotation than what you seem to think . 
  welcome to [ hotelling 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotelling%27s_law#example ) 101 , enjoy your stay !, 
   you can also read in the same article that the foreign minister of poland stated , that strengthening frontex `` is necessary in every sense '' . 
  so shifting all fault to poland is rather unreasonable . 
  nah , by no means all fault . 
  the way i understand it the issue without such an approach is that we 're effectively spending funds twice and are opening the floodgates in terms of how much a country spends on what . 
  first of all just pushing frontex or something similar without more authority means they 're still in their current role of somewhat of a fast-reacting task force . 
  while alright in general this means that 1 ) the load of border control is still unevenly divided ( germany benefits from a strong greek border less than greeks e.g. , but it still does benefit from it ) and more importantly 2 ) we now need regulations that prevent e.g. 
  greece or italy from scaling down their own resources towards their national projects . 
  overall i think the `` everyone takes care of their own borders and batphones if they need help '' * can * work but then at the same time we have people arguing against it because e.g. 
  frontex is known to be loyal to eu laws and standards instead of the host countries policies . 
   the right to asylum have only people , who are really in danger . 
  as it turn out a vast amount of them are n't . 
  and there are also other treaties violated by letting them all in and allowing them to travel freely across the europe . 
  not to mention this solution failed to provide safety to eu citizens and it should be of top priority . 
  fully agreed . 
  that 's the issue in the first place : no single country was capable of handling the influx/processing and we had no structure in place that was able to quickly and impactfully respond . 
  we also had no one who even had a * real * idea from what was happening at least from my german perspective . 
  right now the ` official ' aftermath seems to be that everyone is mad at the eu , frontex is not getting stronger and border sovereignty is kept - with voluntary contributions from countries to help where it 's needed . 
  that approach is completely unsustainable . 
   the last and probably the most important thing : what scale of danger is for you reasonable ? 
  can you name any ratio , any kind of trade-off per 1000 refugees ? 
  i do n't think we can find a `` scale of danger '' . 
  i think if well coordinated , cataloged and deported if necessary ( for example in germany we * now * have some of responsible agencies coming up with the idea that fingerprints might be a good idea which is completely out of touch with reality or we had people applying multiple times because no one really knew they were rejected ) ** if ** all these things are done properly i think 2.5-3 % of the population as refugees would be doable max . 
  for comparison germany will have taken in roughly 1.2 % total including families that are following in the near future . 
  with the way things were handled during the crisis , i would have said that the max is somewhere in the 1 % range simply because while we do n't have many issues with the refugees per se the few that * are * issues are causing pretty big trouble . 
  that kind of brings it around for me tho : it 's the border countries that first and foremost need to be able to deal with this kind of influx properly , humanely and within the scope of eu laws and regulations . 
  our current approach was proven to be completely ineffective and a few countries having great borders with others not so is also not sustainable . 
   i 'm always disgusted when people treat victims statistically . 
  like when one of the german tv stations compared the chance of being killed in an terror attack to some silly thing like chocking ( if i recall correctly ) . 
  these people had families . 
  i would n't be able to tell them it was worth to save someone in exchange for their family member 's life . 
  statistics are the * only * way to look at this to bring it back into perspective . 
  we humans are terrible at distinguishing facts from feelings . 
  overall it 's true that only a tiny , tiny fraction of refugees is responsible for what you 're talking about here and statistics reflect that . 
  and if there 's one thing we learned it 's the people with the least exposure being the most xenophobic . 
  i 've got syrian refugees at our local university , so what ? 
  it 's overall the people who * do n't * know any who are the most against them in the first place . 
   so if poland has concerns about provided solutions , it has all right to oppose taking in anyone . 
  i do n't think it should . 
  i might be on the other extreme end of the spectrum but i was also massively against the [ polish opt-out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom ) in 2007 . 
  i do n't mind if they 're helping out less percentage wise than e.g. 
  germany . 
  we 've got structures for this stuff in place more than they do for example . 
  but year after year me and many people we know look at [ these ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm#projects ) types of stats and * we * have to fight * our right wing * because `` why do we spend money on poland which we could spend here ? '', 
  is one of their main arguments . 
  the idealistic german view is : `` because it 's the right thing to do . '', 
  then being essentially told something among the lines of `` fuck your ideals about refugees we do n't want any here '' feels like complete bullshit . 
  we 've been fighting ** exactly ** that attitude from our right for decades when it was about polish and other eastern european people . 
  to then hear very , very familiar arguments from polish people or the polish government in these discussions about refugees just sucks . 
   does n't work that way . 
  it 's also extremely arrogant to force asylum seekers on nations who do n't want them and who never asked for them , because your own country 's mismanagement of ** your immigration policies ** blew up in your face . 
  take responsibility for your own mess . 
  http://fra.europa.eu/en/charterpedia/article/18-right-asylum  instead these countries broke norms and stopped an insane situation from escalating even further - all the while being denounced in berlin , paris and brussels . 
  `` broke norms '' ? 
  that 's what we call openly violating basic eu laws now ? 
  sure , by all means i do n't mind people trying to reform anything but i * do * mind treating existing values like they 're null and void . 
  _________  germany has no business in lecturing other people on frontex without first fixing their pull factors . 
  yeah , how does any german dare wanting a proper , eu wide border control when we have multiple countries needing assistance that some other countries in the exact same union refuse to provide/are incapable of providing . 
  in the end a vast amount of funding for the east comes from the countries you 're attacking for their terrible policies - and so will ( and already has ) a vast amount of resources for italy and greece when they need help . 
  if countries are free to cherrypick all the positive things the eu has to offer while finding ways to circumvent all the other stuff the eu stands for when it becomes tough then that 's an issue that wo n't be solved by just going `` oh well , they just want to do it differently '' and everyone nodding along . 
  if that 's the approach for when some members decide they 're against basic values compared to the ones they agreed to then maybe we got different definitions of how trust should be built in the first place . 
   how is it an eu problem , when every illegally entering `` refugee '' chants `` germoney '' in protest of them being upheld for security reasons ? 
  can i get a source for that or is hyperbole the way to go now ? 
   before the fence , these people were walking through fields and forests , entering our country . 
  now they have to go through the proper border entry points . 
  this made these so called refugees change route . 
  if that 's * literally * all that happened , i do n't know why any one is upset with anything . 
   lower middle class is increasingly falling into poverty as migration , both legal and illegal increases competition for work , all while automation and globalisation erode the amount of work available . 
  those are exactly the issues i 'd rather expect schulz to deal with than merkel . 
  to be fair schulz is the first guy in ten years who even has a * chance * at coming at merkel . 
  in 2009 [ walter steinmeier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frank-walter_steinmeier ) was the opposing chancellor candidate who , while amazing and now our president , had no chance due to the after math of the crash in 2008 which hit a lot of people that were the base of his party if i remember correctly .
