  that 's what most of this fuss is about in the first place . 
  facebook * acts * like a publisher in a lot of ways but tries to wiggle out of the legal responsibilities of being one in front of the law . 
  in a nutshell they 're doing exactly the type of stuff companies do where i 'm glad that lawmakers are stepping in . 
  fun fact , when we 're talking about the [ electoral college ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #original _ plan ) and the original implementation we actually should admit that the founding fathers had something much better in mind than what we see today . 
  it was just screwed up rather quickly . 
   the original plan of the electoral college was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the framers of the constitution  1 . 
  individual electors would be elected by citizens on a district-by-district basis . 
  each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting . 
  candidates would not pair together on the same ticket with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president . 
  the system as designed would rarely produce a winner , thus sending the election to congress . 
  for [ reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_united_states_steel_tariff ) since this quote is rather amusing :  in retaliation , the european union threatened to counter with tariffs of its own on products ranging from florida oranges to cars produced in michigan , with each tariff calculated to likewise hurt the president in a key marginal state . 
   the united states backed down and withdrew the tariffs on december 4 . 
   in fairness , the statement `` we have a massive trade deficit with germany '' could be accurate . 
  it 's completely accurate since [ at least 1985 ] ( https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4280.html#1985 ) to my knowledge . 
  what he 's not mentioning however is [ this kind of graph ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/balance-of-trade ) that shows when the us did * not * have a trade deficit for the last time in history ( hint : you need to click ` max ' in the graph ) . 
  the basic issue is that if i give you # 1 and you give me a tomato for it then yeah , i have a trade deficit with you . 
  ** i also got something from you in return ** . 
  that 's not bad , that 's not good , that 's just how a trade works . 
   special forces arrested the teenager after police received a tip-off , brandenburg police tweeted ( in german ) . 
  he had sent a message to his family saying farewell and that he was joining the `` jihad '' , the police said . 
   the message was sent via whatsapp in the past week and brandenburg authorities received the tip-off late on monday from two other german states , a police spokesman told the associated press ( ap ) . 
  with all due respect to bbc the [ german speaking articles ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/polizei/anschlag-geplant--cousin-verriet-17-jaehrigen-nidal-a--an-die-polizei-26993938 ) about this are * slightly * more specific which changes the overall narrative a little bit : he sent this message to his ( in lebanon living ) mother who informed a cousin of his living in germany ( berlin ) . 
  said cousin went to the police at ~ 1am local time on tuesday to report him . 
  in the same night two different people from syria went to the police in wolfshagen ( hessen - completely different area ) and informed them that the guy planned an attack for the following monday . 
  at 9am police went into his home and arrested him . 
  nothing incriminating was found so far ( flags , bombs and weapons were mentioned by the police as not being there ) and his electronics are now being searched . 
  _______ basically this is * exactly * what such a case should look like , if it happens in the first place . 
  everyone involved ( including his mother , cousin , his presumably buddies elsewhere and the police ) reacted quickly and professionally . 
  i think that 's worth mentioning in this context , especially because the good old `` these people are just like you and me / s '' [ posts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6e77zv/syrian_held_in_germany_over_attack_plan/di8e170/ ) are already sitting reasonably highly upvoted at this point in time . 
   cultural pluralism - smaller groups maintaining their unique cultural identities , values and practices that are accepted by the wider culture provided they are consistent with the laws and values of the wider society i 'd like to jump in here because while your definition was on point there 's an * extremely * thin line between positively connotated [ cultural pluralism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_pluralism ) and the so-called [ ethnopluralism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnopluralism ) which has been abused by the far-right across europe lately because of how seemingly innocent it can be presented . 
  while the latter word * does * have ` ethno ' in it also draws parallels between ethnicity and culture . 
  this makes culture an unchangeable physical trait and then , from that point of view , advocates for separation , segregation and similar things . 
  the main reason i 'm even mentioning this difference is that in germany a so called `` identitarian movement '' ( [ here ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/melanie-schmitz-der-star-der-ultrarechten-identitaeren-bewegung-a-1149449.html ) an article in german and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/6dthxz/identit%c3%a4re_bewegung_das_postergirl_der_neuen/ ) a recent / r/de thread on the topic ) now does something very specific with this distinction : they point out that cultures should form strong distinct but separate identities which allows them to advocate for segregation and conflict between groups while also saying : `` we want the jews and turks to be strong too !, 
  how can you call us far right ?! '', 
  - while omitting that their ideal of a society is `` those foreigners '' living completely separated so their pure culture ca n't be ` diluted ' . 
  this is a pre-programmed conflict scenario and the people involved in this movement are well aware of that . 
  _________ actual cultural pluralism in the canadian or american sense : a cultural centre where you can learn salsa , yoga and calligraphy . 
  here people from multiple cultures come together and ** share their culture with each other ** . 
  quote wiki :  in a pluralist culture , groups ** not only co-exist side by side ** , but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture . 
  pluralistic societies place strong expectations of integration on members , rather than expectations of assimilation . 
  note that this means integration across * all * members of a society , both of the dominant and of smaller cultures . 
  in this view everyone is expected to do their part and interact with each other . 
  the classic memes about kebap being a national german food ( with it being available pretty much everywhere ) are an example of cultural pluralism in that sense where the dominant culture integrated itself by accepting something ` foreign ' that 's not originally part of their own culture . 
  ______ ethnopluralism or the far-right version of cultural pluralism : salsa is something spaniards do , yoga is something people from india do and calligraphy is something these japs do . 
  no one wants anything to do with anyone else and the goal are parallel societies with as few spots of potential ` dilution ' of culture as possible . 
  think of different toilets or bus seats for different cultures basically - it 's pretty much becoming a new ` pc way ' to say : `` i 'm not a racist but i want nothing to do with those other cultures . 
  ps : culture is not a race !!, 
  ! 1 '' also a casual tag for / u/majambela who explained the basic ideas of this in the / r/de thread i referenced above and sounded more informed than i am over there - just in case i got something terribly wrong . 
  i think that 's a thin or even bad translation . 
  literally she goes `` naturally / obviously in friendship with the us ( referring to taking our destiny into our own hands ) , in friendship with the uk , with good neighborly relations wherever this is possible , including russia , including other countries . '', 
  i personally would ** only ** translate it as '' * even * russia '' without that last bit but the way it is phrased she is going down a list of bulletpoints where the repetition adds meaning through context . 
  take destiny in own hands : * obviously in friendship with the us * [ obviously , implied ] in friendship with the uk * in good neighborly relations wherever possible * also with russia * also with other countries her tone makes no difference between the two `` alsos '' ( `` auch '' in german ) in any way shape or form ( can be heard at 00:29 in the above video ) . 
  ** if ** she wanted to imply `` even with russia '' she would have picked `` sogar mit russland '' in german and not simply throw it in the middle of the list . 
  i 'd argue this has been brewing for over a decade at this point . 
  you got ta keep in mind that most germans alive today grew up with massive , massive pro-american views . 
  things like us nukes on german soil * should * be a topic ( especially considering the overall anti-nuclear positions since the 90s ) but they just are n't because not even our greens actively pushed there . 
  in 2001 a left-green ( ! ), 
  government voted for the war in afghanistan after our chancellor at the time threatened to resign if they do n't . 
  that vote went through with 336 votes when 334 were needed . 
  this among other things hurt those parties to this day . 
  i 'd say that ever since relationships grew a bit more distanced and skeptical , at least in my personal perception . 
  the iraq war ( just like in lots of other european nations ) was the next thing that became a public topic , the wmds that were never found are still something people - rightfully - keep quoting . 
  obama overall made this relationship a lot more friendly but even there between the drones , snowden leaks and the whole nsa spying deal i would n't say that the us was in the best light ever . 
  and now ; trump . 
  quite a few people ( including merkel ) were rather timid with their criticism since it ca n't be * that * bad after all . 
  but between the muslim ban ( that initially affected 100k + german citizens due to them not being able to get rid of iranian nationalities ) and , well , everything else public sentiment was n't exactly on his side overall . 
  the people who consider that relationship stable or reliable at this point are a minority and merkel herself waited as long as she possibly could ( keep in mind how quiet her visit to the us was in comparison ) with being open about this : until the big nato meetup . 
  _______ basically , as a member of the german public , i would n't call her stance `` hawkish '' in an aggressive or violent sense . 
  but what i do fully support is less us , more eu . 
  if they 'd like to put themselves first at the expense of others , their choice . 
  for us ( and that includes you and other eurobros ) the cost of not cooperating is too high to do so , even if the us does n't want to be a part of it anymore . 
  amusingly enough in that speech alone merkel sounded like the ` strong leader ' that quite a few people have been asking for and that people like may love to portray . 
  would n't be surprised if that directly translates to more votes . 
  eh , in this case i 'm inclined to give it a pass . 
  the ` germany wants to have good neighborly relations with non-allies including russia ' - narrative is rather old at this point , well established and overall much less relevant than the relation to the us and closer allies as a whole . 
  case in point : no one anywhere on reddit giving any fucks that she said `` we want a good neighborly relationship with russia '' - it 's just not news at all . 
   you may blame it on the electioneering , but it seems likely she has concluded that trump is impossible to work with , and is unreliable to a degree that leaves europe no choice but to reduce its reliance on the us . 
  in context one * could * argue that 1 ) it 's a csu talk so it might be more conservative / aggressive than usual and 2 ) it 's election time but overall i 'm with you . 
  it 's a statement that combines precisely what trump wanted to accomplish and promised ( `` we 'll rely less on the us '' / `` take destiny into our own hands '' ) while framing it in a very pro-european and cooperative way and simultaneously condemning the position of the us . 
  the good old `` cooperation is best but we ca n't cooperate with those who do n't want to '' in a nutshell . 
  what makes this stand out to me is n't just that she said it , it 's that she was the first of the g7 leaders who took the lead this clearly . 
  i 'd * usually * expect her to hold off for a bit longer so this is quite out of the ordinary . 
  refreshing to see though for me personally , this is exactly the time where i 'd expect her to step up - not a moment too late or too soon either . 
  she waited until the big meetup and until there seemed to be a consensus among major allies overall . 
  much appreciated . 
   and therefore all that 's left for me to say is `` and therefore all that is left for me to say '' has a finite connotation to me , as in `` there 's nothing else i have to say '' when what she said is closer to `` and because of this ( previous paragraph ) / therefore all i can say is ... '' at least to me . 
  the construction around ` only ' like dw did it feels a bit forced in english though for sure . 
  `` therefore i have to say : '' also sounds good now that i think about it . 
   this , of course , in friendship with the usa , in friendship with great britain , in the spirit of being good neighbors wherever possible - also ( even ) with russia , with other countries . 
  `` nat\u00fcrlich '' to me carries more of a connotation of `` obviously '' or `` naturally '' than `` of course '' conveys but that 's a thin nitpick , either is probably fine . 
  the whole `` in guter nachbarschaft '' portion is something where i can see translators fighting over it with everyone being right . 
  the russian connection to me comes across better if we use a similar repetition as she does in the original , something like this :  in the spirit of being good neighbors wherever possible - that includes russia , that includes other countries . 
  ...  but we have to realize : we have to fight ourselves for our future , for our destiny - as europeans . 
  and that 's what i 'd like to do , with all of you , together . '', 
  i love the ` realize ' instead of ` know ' that most translations did . 
  question : to [ my knowledge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/destiny#fate ) ` fate ' vs ` destiny ' is extremely close but different in english . 
  from context however in this case it 's clear that she meant ` schicksal ' twice with the exact same connotation so i 'd argue we need to pick one of the two and stick with it . 
  most translations i 've seen picked ` fate ' which intuitively to me is too predetermined whereas ` destiny ' would be my personal pick since it goes better with the idea of `` our destiny is in our own hands now '' . 
  super curious if you or anyone else thinks there 's a clear answer to which of these makes more sense here . 
  _______ overall i like yours better so all of this is nitpicking on a pretty high level , the dw.com version is overall however one of the better ones i 've seen online .
