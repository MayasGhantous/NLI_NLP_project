  kind of a shame . 
  [ someone else ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6du6fe/merkel_europe_must_plot_its_own_course/di5i0a3/ ) mentioned this version for example where i did cringe a little bit :  `` the times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out . 
  i 've experienced that in the last few days . 
   while germany and europe would strive to remain on good terms with america and britain , `` we have to fight for our own destiny , '', 
  small nitpick :  the times in which we could completely depend on others ** are on the way out . 
  ** that 's an interpretive translation , she used a construction in german that does n't say this . 
  she literally says `` those times ... are a little bit over '' , which specifically omits since when and how much they 're over and where they will develop from there . 
  it * also * specifically denies that they 're actually over . 
   while germany and europe would strive to remain on good terms with america and britain , `` we have to fight for our own destiny , '' the original is a lot warmer here :  of course , that must be done in a spirit of friendship with the united states and britain , she said , `` but we have to wage our own fight for our future , as europeans , for our fate . '', 
  i posted a full transcript further up [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6du6fe/merkel_europe_must_plot_its_own_course/di5liwj/ ) . 
  _______ overall though , i 'd not be surprised if that kind of statement is phrased that way on purpose . 
  both `` schicksal '' and `` auf andere verlassen '' very specifically translate to `` destiny/fate '' and `` relying on others '' with no real wiggle-room for mistranslations . 
  those * do * sound like buzzwords trump loves . 
  eh , there 's spots for [ quite a few eu countries ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/267131/market-share-of-the-leadings-exporters-of-conventional-weapons/ ) to grow there . 
  to my knowledge for example h&k is targeting us markets since years after their earnings dropped due to german restrictions on weapons exports towards the middle east . 
  the list of [ who actually buys all these arms ] ( http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160524104218-arms-sales-by-country-gfx-exlarge-169.jpg ) is n't too encouraging overall however . 
   no , ` europe ' refers to europe . 
  we have a separate term for the eu . 
  it 's ` the eu ' . 
  i respect angela merkel too much to assume she does n't know the difference . 
  in context she means the eu here , check the full quote and translation [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6du6fe/merkel_europe_must_plot_its_own_course/di5liwj/ ) . 
  she literally says `` we europeans must ... in friendship with the uk . '', 
  it 's overall very clear language that 's coming from her and at least to me this is definitely showing the situation is everything but ordinary . 
  for the sake of completeness since i 'm seeing multiple translations around with slight differences [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/yannikouts/status/868845655049080833 ) a video of the quote in question . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/merkel-europe-can-no-longer-rely-on-us-and-britain/a-39018097 ) the article on this from dw.com with the following translation :  `` the times when we could fully rely on others have passed us by a little bit , that 's what i 've experienced in recent days . '', 
   `` for that reason , '' merkel continued , `` i can only say : we europeans really have to take our fates in our own hands . '', 
   of course , that must be done in a spirit of friendship with the united states and britain , she said , `` but we have to wage our own fight for our future , as europeans , for our fate . '', 
  only relevant thing missing from the dw.com version is that she also mentioned ( after * friendship * with the us & uk ) `` good * neighborly relationships * wherever this is possible , including russia , including other countries . '', 
   i was only thinking about `` brutal '' military ... now , i am not entirely sure when you put on the table capitalism vs war what i mean is pretty much politics since ww2 . 
  if the economies of nations are intertwined then war makes zero sense . 
  we 're not just relying on nations not * wanting * to go to war but our economies are ensuring that it 's extremely hard for them to even consider . 
  does that make more sense ? 
   edit : broken angrish ... plz understand  no problem , we can just ask each other until we understand . 
    going to answer here about yours comment about eu vs. anglosphere ( dunno how to link specific parts of a comment in reddit , so please , enlight me , via pm , really ... ) use the ''  '' sign in front of a text to do that . 
   quote turns into :  quote ...  mine was a extrema ratio scenario , ok ? 
  if this scenario , in your opinion , never going to happen , ok , all good ... no probs , life 's goes on ... but what if ? 
  i think it 's naive to assume that wars will never happen again , even between developed nations . 
  we either learn how to cooperate on a global level ( which means everyone will have to make compromises ) or we will eventually end up fighting over resources even more than we do now . 
  what we need to hope is that , if nations stop cooperating , the process is slow enough that we can collectively deal with it . 
  cooperation  isolation , that to me needs to be * the * defining political view and that is the by far biggest strength of the eu as a whole . 
  if we stick together and to fundamental values that allow others to cooperate with us if they want we 're in good shape for the future . 
  i 'm not * entirely * sure what you 're trying to say , the basic issue with these scenarios is that we have no precedent for them and germans out of all people probably understand that it 's hard to predict what people are capable of collectively . 
  let me put it this way , if any major military power on this planet gives rise to another guy or another regime like we have seen under the nazis then nuclear deterrent is in my opinion the only thing that * really * matters apart from economies so intertwined that war is simply not an option in the first place . 
  capitalism and global corporations themselves are probably the best deterrent to at least slow such a development down massively . 
  what i 'm hinting at : if the current us president yells `` we need these countries to pay up ! '', 
  then i doubt he has an eu army as the result of this ` paying up ' in mind . 
  it would n't be useless to nato at all , but it could be rather useless ( or even counterproductive ) to american interests specifically . 
  all military spending by a nato member is increasing the money spent by nato as a whole but not all military spending by a nato member goes towards what some members see as the purpose of nato in the first place . 
  that 's where i 'd put a difference that 's worth mentioning . 
  european countries could literally up spending , invest it into a common military and suddenly everyone is fulfilling their obligations . 
  there 's quite [ a few more groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_r1a#asia ) rich in r1a . 
   since is only an opportunistic joke , the 2 % or whatever % germany gon na put in nato , is pointless wait a second , correct me if i 'm wrong but the target is ** 2 % military spending ** and not * 2 % military spending towards nato * , is n't it ? 
  increase spending , put most of the money towards european integration , done . 
  nato strong , eu strong , us influence within nato lowered in comparison . 
  easy !, 
   there are 10k radical salafists in germany , increasing by roughly 1000 every year since 2011 . 
  it should be noted that [ at least according to the data i 'm finding ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/salafismus_in_deutschland#situation_in_deutschland ) we 're talking roughly 8k in may 2016 with 100-150 of them being considered dangerous with quite a few groups being under surveillance by the [ bfv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_office_for_the_protection_of_the_constitution ) . 
  the total amount pretty much doubled since 2011 . 
  however , and not mentioning this is rather dishonest in this context , some of the most influential known people from that ` scene ' are as native german as you can get with names such as [ `` pierre vogel '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierre_vogel ) , `` eric breininger '' ( most likely dead ) or `` sven lau '' ( anyone remember the `` sharia police '' - story ? 
  yeah , that 's the guy who was behind it ) . 
  overall these groups are extremely weirdly composed . 
  * [ abdul adhim kamouss ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdul_adhim_kamouss ) , born in marocco , in germany since 1997 , officially distances himself from that scene since a few years and openly speaks out against radicals apparently . 
  * [ bernhard falk ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernhard_falk_ ( islamist \\ ) ) , previously jailed for years for [ left-wing terrorism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-imperialist_cell ) . 
  * [ denis cuspert ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/denis_cuspert ) , born in germany , mother german , father from ghana but grew up with an american dad - gangsta-rapper and likely dead . 
  * [ ibrahim abou-nagie ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibrahim_abou-nagie ) , palestinian origin , had multiple smaller cases against him in front of courts already . 
  * [ muhamed ciftci ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/muhamed_ciftci ) , son of turkish immigrants , extremist preacher , former head of the group that is now lead by sven lau . 
  * [ reda sayam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reda_seyam ) , egyptian origin , radicalized in the 1990s , most likely dead . 
  ___ tl ; dr : the leadership of these groups is all across the board and seemingly hard to pin down . 
  they 're all male and * most * seemed to have radicalized in their 20s but that 's about it with similarities . 
  just tagging on for the record , when the topic of `` is trump a christian ? '', 
  comes up you can literally link [ christianitytoday ] ( http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/august/james-dobson-explains-why-donald-trump-baby-christian.html ) , which is full of beautiful quotes on the topic :  if anything , trump 's candidacy is revealing the inner secularization of the evangelical movement , where evangelical no longer means something many would recognize as properly christian , westminster seminary -- california professor michael horton wrote for ct. . .  trump `` lives a life of loving and helping others as jesus taught in the great commandment , '' said jerry falwell jr. tl ; dr : you 're right on point . 
  * gay guy not mentioned . 
  * year 2917 . 
  * [ norways ingrid schulerund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingrid_schulerud ) is not * exactly * the same category as the others . 
  ... and the order is out of whack . 
  shamelessly stolen from [ here ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-photo-of-political-spouses-has-the-internet-buzzing/ ) :  ( front row , l-r ) : brigitte macron of france ; emine gulbaran erdogan of turkey ; first lady of the u.s. melania trump ; queen mathilde of belgium ; ingrid schulerud , wife of nato 's secretary-general ; desislava radeva of bulgaria ; amelie derbaudrenghien of belgium ; ( back row , l-r ) : gauthier destenay of luxembourg ; mojca stropnik of slovenia ; and thora margret baldvinsdottir of iceland pose for a family photo on may 25 , 2017 , in brussels . 
  there 's * so * much wrong with this description this that i can see a facebook intern passing this along with a `` what do we call this guy ? 
  ps : proofread pls . 
  '' - note and it then getting posted anyway . 
  now , why someone that incompetent ( or even malicious ) is responsible for this type of thing is a whole different question . 
  the reason i 'd call it `` bad '' compared to most systems i understand is because of how it is set up in practice . 
  the basic issue i personally have with it is that it was [ built under the assumption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #original _ plan ) that the president and congress are ** not ** in agreement by definition . 
  once however you interpret the electors in the electoral college as people who do n't vote their conscience but what their constituents tell them to vote a two party state is pretty much guaranteed since the president getting elected by a 50 % majority is a massive advantage to one party that can accomplish this . 
  once you have a two-party system it boils down to a bit of random chance until one party holds both the presidency and the majority in congress . 
  hell , president and vp being on the same ticket was * also * not intended - another thing that removes a check/balance portion . 
  once you 're in a situation where president , vp and congress are in general agreement they have the ability to control the judiciary with a simple 50 % majority . 
  now * completely random factors * ( time of death of supreme court judges ) start playing a role ( remember the us also has no requirement for scotus judges at all , even though this was never relevant in modern history ) . 
  basically it 's old ( designed before parties were a thing even ) , was at least partially built on weak assumptions and never really got an overhaul that aimed to fix these types of underlying issues . 
  now it 's at a point where such an overhaul would hurt everyone involved in politics at the moment so there is n't any interest in it . 
  meanwhile the population keeps getting told how great their system is and no real pressure for change comes from that direction either . 
  ____ all these complaints can be traced back to the system as a whole massively favoring a two-party state with all the issues that brings along so if you end up having a similar system that does ** not ** devolve into 50 % majority being king and also a frequent occurrence you 're fine in my opinion . 
  political interests being forced into compromises by the system is overall a good thing in the grand scheme of things i 'd say . 
  you also ca n't compare the us president to the german chancellor at all in terms of power level . 
  the chancellor , on purpose , is comparatively weak and pretty much always needs 50 % of the electorate to back him or her up . 
  hell , the chancellor is n't even commander-in-chief . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/c/3/csm_folie4_407bde_99addc607e.png ) is pretty much the perspective in a nutshell over time . 
  the question asked is : `` are the us a partner for germany that one can trust or not ? '', 
  and is a reasonable assessment for how the general population feels at that point in time . 
  basically the perspective slowly recovered but never went back to the high points of ' 09 . 
  the latest numbers i know from [ april ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6snmbth.jpg ) put that view at 29 % `` yes '' and 66 % `` no '' .
