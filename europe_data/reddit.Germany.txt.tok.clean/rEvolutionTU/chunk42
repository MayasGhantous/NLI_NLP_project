  the lowest points for obama are pretty much the high so far for trump . 
   in my opinion , if someone says that they should be immediately interrogated and put in prison for a couple of days until we figure out what the hell is going on . 
  agreed . 
   if the agencies want to find out about something , be sure that they can bypass the vpns and find out your life 's history . 
  also agreed . 
  my issue stems from this statement of yours :  put them on a high-priority list if they browse terrorist sites . 
  that requires surveillance on every single citizens browsing behavior and * way * more than that . 
  facebook groups , messengers , emails - all kinds of stuff . 
  the solution to people sending each other terrorist propaganda via regular mail is n't to open all mails sent across the country . 
  mass surveillance does n't help here , it is in no way shape or form equivalent with `` safety '' . 
  i 'm all for specific interventions with judiciary oversight * when * we get hints or ideas that people are affiliated with this specific stuff ( like it seems to have been in the case you linked ) , it 's your concept of `` safety and surveillance vs chaos and no surveillance '' that i 'm considering extremely dangerous . 
  privacy * is * crucial to all of our societies and should n't be something you 're willing to throw away because of terrorism just because some people argue : `` trust us , this would help ! '', 
   what do you want ? 
  safety and surveillance or chaos and no surveillance because muh rights and i can be a terrorist if i want ? 
  `` safety and surveillance '' does n't work - case in point : the uk . 
  past a certain point of mass surveillance it just becomes a powergrab by the government . 
  and even with that you ca n't prevent all attacks or even communication in general . 
  whatsapp or similar messengers were used in the past , vpns are a thing . 
  do you want every single word you ever digitally communicated be stored in governmental databases ? 
  and * even * if you somehow keep tabs on all these things people can still simply talk to each other . 
  we had terrorist groups organizing before the internet as well . 
  _______ what you 're suggesting is that a total surveillance network of all citizens without an actual guarantee that it can 100 % prevent these types of attacks . 
   i do n't know why the alt right keeps regurgitating that shit . 
  because `` if you 're not with us you 're against us '' is a common theme among extremists . 
  if the issue is framed as black and white then you just need to portray the other side as extremist and gain points - after all there is no grey at all . 
  something the alt-right and radical islamists actually have in common . 
   what 's amazing is that after . . 10 years ? 
  people still can think only of breivik . 
  that 's because for example [ in this case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_munich_shooting#perpetrator ) , where an admirer of his who went on a shooting spree , it took a few days to make the connection . 
  until then people heard a ~ ~ made-up ~ ~ unconfirmed anonymous witness on cnn making ` alahu akbar ' claims , discussed how germany tries to cover up his real motive by not publishing his last name and our right wing parties were busy blaming merkels refugee policy when it turned out that it was * literally * the famous lone male attacker , just here with right-wing ideologies on top . 
  we also had a [ right-extremist terror cell ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground_murders ) that was organized and killing people over almost a decade not too long ago . 
  the best part ? 
  police and authorities assumed honor-killings and right-wing groups were n't even investigated for a long time . 
  the usual press outlets were full of `` turkish mafia strikes again !, 
  '' - headlines whenever another murder happened . 
  in the first half of 2016 alone we had * at least * 55 cases ( the numbers are frequently attacked by various reputable groups for being much too exclusive ) of arson and four bombings against refugee centers from right-wingers in germany . 
  and all the above is only about things that happened in germany specifically . 
  _______ there are a * lot * of things ` people ' can think of when it comes to terrorism from multiple angles , it 's just that you 're hearing less about it . 
  nazis made jokes about greedy jews as well and yes , memes about german humor aside , i refuse to play those down as `` nazis having a bit of fun '' either . 
  in this case , as we just learned , it was n't so much a joke but a symptom of a [ more specific attitude ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6csvh4/german_police_smash_paneuropean_burglary_ring/dhxdnpg/ ) . 
  it 's not humorous if your next step ( and the motivation behind the ` joke ' ) is recommending genocide . 
   if hitler had just focused on the gypsies he 'd be a hero of europe today , guaranteed . 
  of course genocide is a great idea if it 's about people * you * do n't like . 
  you * probably * were also raised in a bit less loyalty inspiring way compared to what a family involved in organized crime would raise their kids like . 
  this may be a bit of a dumb question , i 'm actually not sure . 
  if we want to tap a phone we need a court order and we regulate who can be tapped for how long etc. 
  why do n't we extend the same idea to `` tapping whatsapp '' , `` tapping facebook '' or `` tapping a vpn '' ? 
  i would n't mind vpns being pushed out that do n't comply with court orders * assuming we get the proper legal framework that should come with this power * . 
  it worked for sending regular mail , why does n't it work here ? 
  i personally do n't even have that big of an issue with selective surveillance as long as the judiciary gets the last word on it , after all that 's what it 's there for in similar scenarios . 
  why is the ` solution ' mass surveillance including millions of regular citizens and not ways that allow security agencies and police to investigate specific known targets precisely ? 
  alright . 
  every person linked with terrorism that we know about and can be deported is magically deported . 
  * what do you do about your own citizens ? 
  do we also arrest them for `` browsing isis sites '' ? 
  how do we define ` isis site ' ? 
  what about people browsing stormfront and posting in forums there ? 
  the [ nsu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_underground ) is still glorified on facebook by german right-wing extremists . 
  do we want to arrest people for merely * browsing and reading * when half the world likes to criticize germany arresting them for uttering `` opinions '' ? 
  * how do you define `` getting in touch with terrorists '' if it 's not browsing and participating in forums on these kinds of sites or for these kinds of topics ? 
  * for what you 're suggesting we need mass surveillance of browsing behavior of every single citizen of a nation . 
  would you like to have that ? 
  if yes , how do you prevent abuse ? 
  do you want * more * surveillance than the uk already has ? 
  * how do you address people who are more careful with their online behavior once this is implemented ? 
  terrorists met before the internet and managed to organize . 
  vpns and tor are a thing . 
  the internet is just a vehicle for the ideology behind it in the end . 
  is this * still * as simple as you make it out to be ? 
  the top comment in this very thread talks about `` goat fuckers '' and was made at 0200 gmt . 
  i 'm pretty sure that does reveal a certain agenda , especially since it 's made at a time with barely any information available whatsoever . 
   our fking goverment seems to think the root cause of all this is the internet and communications ... rather than the god damn obvious root cause of a religious cult that needs to be mercilessly eliminated . 
  how does that cult manage to reach people on a global scale ? 
  why does the `` knowledge '' of this type of event spread all across the globe within minutes and hours ? 
  if my goal is to spread terror with such an attack the internet is a godsend . 
  if my goal is to reach people all across the globe with minimal effort , the internet again is the best thing that could happen . 
  i 'm personally deep in the privacy camp for any citizen of our nations that had nothing to do with any crimes , but still saying that the internet is n't related to this massively simplifies the issue . 
  maybe i 'm terribly informed here but that sounds more like putins interest than the interest of the is . 
  depends on the perspective . 
  in this context ( since we 're talking about the is perspective specifically ) `` moderate '' means anyone who is not a muslim and not part of their cause :  journalist rukmini maria callimachi also emphasises isil 's interest in polarization or in eliminating what it calls the `` grey zone '' between the black ( non-muslims ) and white ( isil ) . 
  `` the gray is moderate muslims who are living in the west and are happy and feel engaged in the society here . '', 
  now , this is obviously a completely different thing than what `` moderate '' would mean by a european standard but at least i personally am having a bit of difficulty defining that because i do n't think it 's that easy . 
  * personally * to me a moderate religious person is completely secular in the sense that their religion deals with issues that in no way shape or form collide with constitutional or democratic values - but that 's probably also a bit of an extremist view . 
  especially considering that e.g. 
  germany is mostly ruled by a '' * christian * democratic union '' that for example specifically blocks gay marriage because of a religious background . 
  __________  would a moderate muslim tolerate his children convert to christianity ? 
  i 'd say that 's a good starting point but if we define it like that we have a * lot * of people who are n't moderate from all over the place . 
  think of all the parents who do n't `` tolerate '' their children being gay for example ( and how do you define they `` tolerate it '' vs they do n't ? ) . 
  if they 're against this kind of thing but deal with it nevertheless i think that 's a good starting point . 
  we ca n't force different opinions , but we * can * ( and have to ) force that people do n't try to push their opinions with violence . 
  overall , on a large scale , we 're doing a fantastic job there . 
  the [ nazi rally grounds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_party_rally_grounds ) today are ( apart from the museums ) * pretty much * a racing track , swimming pools , parking space and even more space for events . 
  if you look at [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_party_rally_grounds#/media/file:karte_reichsparteitagsgel%c3%a4nde_n%c3%bcrnberg_1940.png ) map from the wiki page you can compare it straight up to [ this google map ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/maps/place/nuremberg,+germany/@49.4244797,11.1235137,3631m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x479f57aeb5b61cd3:0xdd5daf85a98c21b7!8m2!3d49.4254092!4d11.0796553?hl=en ) from today and get an idea of what it got turned into . 
  also : tourism . 
  no , europe * is * god because god created america . 
  yup , you 're right there . 
  it 's just reducing the idea behind it to `` just kill some people '' is still way too simplified . 
  that 's why from my point of view * any * singular approach is such a terrible idea in the first place . 
  it 's one thing to try to prevent radicals from carrying out attacks ( which will never have a 100 % success rate ) , it 's another to try to prevent people from radicalizing in the first place . 
  that 's where harsh rules against hate preachers and criminals but * also * good treatment of your local religious communities , stronger integration and more efforts to reduce inequality come into play .
