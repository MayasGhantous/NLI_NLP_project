  we 're all in this together in the end . 
  * show strength * rally support * intimidate civilians * force governments and regular people to do things they otherwise would n't * drive regular muslims away from society all these things and more play a role , reducing it to just `` they want to kill people '' is n't exactly clever either . 
  the [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#purpose_and_strategy ) also goes more indepth here . 
  the overall goal is to radicalize everyone on all sides because from their point of view that would be the biggest win imaginable . 
  so yes , they * are * winning and all of this frenzy is helping along . 
  we * literally * do n't know what 's going on at this point in time . 
  that 's probably the smartest approach , we 're all playing our part in feeding the frenzy that leads to this media shitstorm . 
  at this point most major threads look like rushes to confirm biases and trying to convince the world about them . 
  all these three say different things . 
  the democracy index is closer to the [ freedom in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_in_the_world ) index , where brazil currently sits at 1/2 pts and poland at 1/2 ( dropped from a 1/1 rating recently ) . 
  the corruption index you 're citing defines corruption as `` the misuse of public power for private benefit '' . 
  in the pfi the difference between poland ( 26.47 - note how ** massively ** that rating dropped over the last few years ? ), 
  and brazil ( 33.58 ) is similar to the difference between norway ( 7.6 ) and germany ( 14.97 ) . 
  japan/hungary/greece / ukraine are all closer to brazil than poland but poland is also closer to brazil than to germany in this ranking . 
  ____ all these three indices can be true at the same time with no issue whatsoever . 
  if you want to look at the pfi and you find out that brazil lacks behind but that quite some eu countries are close . 
  if you look at the corruption index you find out that public power is more often used for private benefit in brazil ( 40 pts ) than in the eu countries . 
  ** but ** also that countries like italy ( 47 ) , greece ( 44 ) , romania ( 48 ) or hungary ( 48 ) are dangerously close - none of these have a * good * ranking . 
  and if you look at the democracy index you see that it ranks brazil and poland * extremely * close within each other with poland clearly leading in `` political participation '' while brazil is clearly leading in `` functioning of government '' . 
  the category `` electoral process and pluralism '' has a small brazil lead , `` political participation '' has a small polish lead and finally `` civil liberties '' has a small lead for brazil again . 
  ___________ the tl ; dr is exactly the same as for the pfi : they 're both not in great spots and while we can argue over details they 're * closer to each other * on average than to e.g. 
  countries much higher or lower on the list . 
  you 're trying to draw conclusions that the data itself does n't show : ** we ca n't conclude `` x is ahead of y in category z hence it 's in a better shape overall '' . 
  ** what we * can * conclude is that poland has less corruption ( within a rather strict definition ) than brazil overall and more freedom of press overall . 
  ** the democracy index literally says : `` they 're both okay but neither is in great shape on this topic . 
  '' ** if you 're concluding that making such a statement means the `` index you cited is flawed '' then so be it , ca n't help you there . 
  they 're both in the broad category of `` flawed democracy '' with 0.07 points difference in their average . 
  it 's like asking `` is it accurate in your opinion that switzerland is ahead of finland ? '', 
  - some things will be better , some worse , overall they 'll be similar . 
  if you actually have a clear answer to either of those questions you 're most likely not competent enough to give one . 
  personal opinions do n't mean much when it comes to something like this . 
  rankings like this are usually reasonable things to paint similar things with a wide brush to get a general idea of where things stand . 
  individual placements do n't mean much while the general picture is what is important . 
   it is a particularly unequal society which is normal for countries that depend so heavily on resource extraction ( the other sa is another example ) , if you look to per capita then it is # 88 , # 87 or # 94 depending on your source . 
  i mentioned that , which makes it one of the leading african countries . 
  that 's the same range of peru , colombia or serbia . 
  i 'll be a bit of a dick and show you what the issue is that i 'm having with your argumentation . 
  * you 're not grounding it in verifiable data . 
  *  most people in this country are poor , not prosperous . 
  citation needed . 
  you 'd specifically have to show that both poverty increases * and * prosperity overall increases . 
  to my knowledge while yes , sa has massive inequality and this being a major issue for the country it also has poverty rates that are going back . 
   i think you 're missing the core point i was making . 
  population growth without corresponding economic growth leads to poverty . 
  the point i was making : * all * countries have population growth until medical , educational and other basic advancements kick in , then they slow down no matter where on the planet they are . 
  bangladesh is at 135 + in gdp ppp lists - yet its fertility rate is also down to 2.55 . 
   you should talk to south africans sometime , they 'll be happy to tell you everything you mentioned has gotten worse . 
  anecdotal evidence . 
   south africa was a developed country , it has rapidly gone in the opposite direction for a long time now . 
  life span has shrunk by a decade since ' 94 . 
  citation needed . 
  actually i 'll [ give you one ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:zaf:usa:ken&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:zaf:usa:ken:bgd&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  according to that first of all it 's five years change since '94 and not a decade and it 's * also * in a clear upwards trend again . 
  you [ do know ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apartheid ) what happened in ' 94 , right ? 
  these graphs in general show * exactly * what i was talking about . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;idim=country:zaf:usa:ken&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:zaf:usa:ken:bgd:deu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-303444000000&amp;tend=1400623200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) , fertility rates . 
   you should be very aware that most numbers the government gives are not real . 
  the government is # 1 for making up numbers . 
  citations needed that clearly shows which numbers i 'm using so far are not real . 
   do you believe south africa is a place with higher real gdp ( adjusted by ppp ) per capita in 1 decade ? 
   is that a bet you 're willing to make ? 
  i have ** zero interest ** in being right here . 
  what i care about is that you 're offering anecdotal evidence , no real data and when confronted with data that go against your view you 're going `` ah , yeah , those are false/misleading '' . 
  that 's no basis for discussion in any shape whatsoever . 
    press freedom index , democracy index  these are exactly the kind of things that are not trustworthy or which miss the point . 
  citation needed . 
  we 're talking about sources that when cited in [ every other context ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index#/media/file:press_freedom_2017_rwb.svg ) from north korea over china , russia and the middle-east all the way to western europe are considered accurate approximations . 
  you ca n't just go `` ah , yeah , in * this * case that 's misleading or misses the point ! '', 
  without offering any evidence in favor of that viewpoint . 
  & nbsp ;  would you rather live in south africa , greece , poland or hungary ? 
  i honestly ca n't answer that question because i have n't looked into any of these . 
  if * you * can answer that question without spending days or even weeks to figure out an answer for yourself then i 'd be worried unless you have some kind of connection to one of these countries . 
  i would * assume * that i 'd be better off in eu countries but all of them would be downgrades for me personally so i have no clue . 
  ** look at the videos in the link i just posted . 
  ** and then tell me with a straight face that these are all examples of what fair and free democratic elections look like to you . 
  i 'm actually surprised i do n't see you guys link [ this op ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/65pe5y/megathread_2017_constitutional_referandum_results/ ) from / r/turkey every time someone goes `` but the turks voted for the referendum ! '', 
  - those videos speak for themselves . 
  apart from that i 'm genuinely hoping you and other posters living in turkey are taking precautions at this point which should include vpns and such and being more careful in general . 
   iirc south africa had an 8 fold increase in population in half that time . 
  mostly without the economic growth . 
  you mean the south africa with a gdp per capita right behind brazil and way ahead of e.g. 
  ukraine and overall still in the top 50 % internationally ? 
  hell if you look at [ gdp ppp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) ) we 're talking # 30 . 
  the south africa that * doubled * it 's population [ since 1970 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_south_africa#1904_census ) ? 
  that 's a twofold increase , not 8 fold . 
  the country which has a [ population growth rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate ) that 's between ** norway and sweden at this point ** ? 
  they 're at a [ 2.4 fertility rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rate ) - israel is at 3.1 in comparison . 
   organic growth ( not government or ngo related ) in businesses . 
  literally every third world country started with a textile industry and industrial farming . 
  we shipped africa in general clothing and food which lead to those local industries dying off or not even getting off the ground . 
  you just picked * the * most developed african country , one that shows the [ slowing down growth rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate#/media/file:population_growth_rate_world_2005-2010_un.png ) i was talking about that comes with education , basic wealth and medical availability , mentioned numbers that have nothing to do with reality and did n't bother looking them up because you had such a negative image in your head that you could n't even imagine it looking any better than that . 
   it is possible to have 40 , 60 million people existing in a state of abject poverty without any integration into an economy , for decades , trapped by small groups of violent psychopaths who use their plight to procure money . 
  in no sense is that a real economy as you and i know it . 
  it 's not even at the level of a feudal system . 
  south africa on the [ press freedom index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) is , among others , ahead of france , the uk and the us among others and basically half of the eu . 
  on the [ democracy index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index ) it 's a solid # 39 ahead of , among others , greece , poland or hungary . 
  ________ the fact that we 're talking about population growth in africa and your first instinct was to pick on south africa out of all countries based on completely incorrect data and images you had stuck in your head should * really * give you something to think about . 
  all of us have biases , all of us are misinformed sometimes . 
  not a big deal when you adjust those perspectives with more information but you just picked a spot that 's genuinely a bit scary because of how off it is . 
  we should be better than that , * especially * because we have every possible tool on our hands to access this kind of information .
