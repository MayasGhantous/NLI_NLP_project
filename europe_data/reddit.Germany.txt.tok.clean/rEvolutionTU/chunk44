  oh jesus , you 're obviously right . 
  i fucked up , edited the post now to reflect reality . 
  noteworthy the numbers you 're seeing there * should * be higher than what you know about germany from most international maps . 
  that can be noticed when you compare [ eu stats ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/160142/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-den-eu-laendern/ ) with [ german stats ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1224/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-deutschland-seit-1995/ ) specifically - e.g. 
  6.1 % for germany in the latter which is what the above map is based on versus 3.9 % in the eu map which most people know . 
  this happens because the german definition of `` unemployed '' is simply different than the one used for international comparisons ( which results in 50 % higher unemployment from a national perspective ) which we usually see being used to compare different nations . 
  basically while yes , based on that perspective unemployment is low compared to eu countries germany itself does n't see it that way at all . 
  except for the whole religious christian bullshit , yeah . 
  pretty up there at least . 
  agreed , that 's the one thing where the east clearly wins . 
  the states over there also do n't have `` fear of god '' as a constitutional goal for education . 
  at least i do hope so . 
  yeah that was dumb of me to simplify it like that , i edited my post with your map . 
  fear of the unknown is a powerful thing . 
  when i leave the house there 's an amazing turkish store and an amazing russian store right there . 
  when you interact with different people on a regular basis you end up realizing that they 're much more similar to yourself than they 're different . 
   woman are also ... tend to leave their home areas . 
  i 'd not be surprised if this also comes down to more traditional values . 
  the idea that if a young man leaves his home/area `` he deserts his family '' ( aka his parents ) while when a young woman does the same she `` moved to find a better life and start a family '' . 
  i 'd not surprised if that 's a result of post-war history because by far the most pressure on this issue comes from the [ csu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_social_union_in_bavaria ) , the exclusively bavarian version of the national level cdu ( which people know as merkels party ) . 
  they 're basically the little and across the board more conservative brother that was allowed to hold 10 % of the electorate hostage since their founding . 
  while i doubt the cdu voterbase would be straight up * for * a clear gay marriage it certainly does n't help that this arrangement basically keeps pushing more conservative people than what voters actually * might * want to see into power on a national level . 
  i mean , bavaria ** literally ** has `` fear of god '' in it 's constitution as an educational goal . 
  or the prephase of the bavarian constitution which talks about a `` state and social order without god '' that , among other things , `` has lead the survivors of the 2nd world war '' to a `` scene of devastation '' . 
  in practice it 's a * bit * more subtle than that but overall this among other things is where the texas jokes come from . 
  i think it 's actually harder to find maps or graphs that * do n't * show this correlation .

  that video in general is great . 
  either you or [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bwhma/when_deep_machine_learning_meets_the_german/dhr6uso/ ) guy need to re-evaluate swedish i think . 
  lol . 
  alright , what makes you a professional that has a more qualified and competent opinion than the scientifical consensus ? 
  people into homeopathy and flat-earthers also argue against the scientific consensus and reason because * their personal knowledge and experience * apparently contradicts it - exactly what you 're doing here . 
   do you understand most doctors still prescribe low fat diets regularly for symptoms ranging from high blood pressure to fatty livers ? 
  [ citation needed ] - one that establishes that this claim is true for example for the eu . 
   the food pyramid is still taught liberally in kindergarden . 
  [ citation needed ] * which * food pyramid exactly ? 
  the last time the german dge food recommendation was adjusted was in 2005 for example . 
  the austrian one in 2010 . 
   and once they run away for germany , well germany will probably rage quit at some point and start mass-deporting them , because they 're perfectly illegal there . 
  i 'd go as far as saying these kind of quotas are * exactly * what most people claim to be asking for : separating those with economical interests from those who are happy with refugee in a first world european country . 
  even if we ignore the fact that the vast majority of them * should * be sent back once this blows over to a reasonable degree and assume they ** all ** want to stick around : if the relocation properly considers things such as family ties , family units or language skills then someone who blatantly disregards it pretty much tells everyone involved that they 're not respecting basic rules set for them . 
  the guy who says `` sure , i 'll try to make due here and try to do my part '' ( ideally without being bullied out by the local population/government ) is exactly the type of person who is actually likely to contribute positively in the long run . 
   where was solidarity when merkel invited them without consulting with fellow member states ? 
  obligatory link to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) thread . 
   do you understand the significance of that sentence : `` nearly every major recommendation that was consensus has been debunked '' show me a science where this is the case . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superseded_scientific_theories#superseded_theories ) is a start , and those are just the most well-known examples . 
  but instead of even considering the possibility that finding better and more accurate theories is literally the point of the scientific method you 're going `` there probably is none '' and move on as if that claim was true . 
  that 's the issue here : putting personal beliefs above available data without any reflection whatsoever . 
  what you can google or ca n't google is irrelevant , what the consensus of people ** massively ** better educated on the subject than you are me is is relevant . 
  you 're making unsourced claims based on personal experience and anecdotes with zero scientifically valid evidence to back them up . 
  that 's ** exactly ** what the parents in this case did and this should stand as an example of what this kind of behavior leads to . 
  it 's also * exactly * the same as what anti-vaccers , flat-earthers or adherents of homeopathy do . 
  and it puts them , their families and society at large at risk once it 's about a topic like health or child care . 
  yeah , same deal . 
  * most * dutch or danish ( or similar ) languages also make sense to germans if we look at them like that . 
  for example `` anden '' looks like `` andere '' ( german for ` other ' ) and could be the same origin , `` generation '' is the same in german and `` indvanderer '' is obviously close to `` einwanderer '' in german . 
  so even though the first one comes out wrong i can guesstimate it to `` the other generation immigrant '' and be reasonably close . 
  it 's when you guys * talk * that everyone is completely lost because potatoes and all that . 
  =p _______ in everyday language it makes for interesting wordplays or opens up all the nice words like `` kindergarten '' or `` schadenfreude '' that previously did n't have meanings but now make perfect sense despite not * literally * being about a garden full of kids nowadays . 
  but then it 's [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rinderkennzeichnungs-_und_rindfleischetikettierungs%c3%bcberwachungsaufgaben%c3%bcbertragungsgesetz ) kinds of words that everyone finds stupid/amusing that usually gain fame a lot easier . 
  ... you 're commenting in a thread about a baby that died because parents gave zero fucks about any scientific or medical consensus and are arguing that giving zero fucks about any scientific consensus on the topic and listening to your personal ideas because they somehow are supposedly more sensible is the best possible thing to do . 
   i 'm into nutrition for 20 + years and nearly every major recommendation that was consensus has been debunked . 
  anyone ` being into something ' is n't an automatic sign of competence . 
  the ** very goal ** of the scientific method is to debunk your own claims . 
  being wrong and trying to prove claims wrong is what makes progress even possible . 
  if a scientific community gains evidence that something was n't accurate and says `` yup , was n't true '' then that 's a * good * thing . 
  that 's how it 's supposed to work . 
  ___________ you 're doing ( and even * promoting * ) the exact same things that lead to this tragedy : ignoring facts and research as well as scientific and medical consensus . 
  now i 've seen it all . 
  but surely * everyone else * must be delusional . 
  you 're * still * only citing anecdotal evidence and are telling someone who actually cites things based on evidence that they 're clueless while you 're absolutely incapable of providing ** a single proper scientific source for a single of your claims in this entire thread ** . 
  what 's terrifying is that kind of religious adherence to one 's own beliefs with a complete disregard for even the most basic ideas on how an argument needs to be framed for it to make any logical sense . 
  * that * is what uncritical whims look like . 
  / r/de was [ having fun with this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/6bvknc/wenn_deep_machine_learning_auf_die_deutsche/ ) earlier , the gist is that it depends on which version you 're entering exactly , see [ this picture ] ( http://imgur.com/a/i4g3l ) . 
  also google translates * hates * if you remove that full stop . 
  ... so what you 're saying is that people bitch at * germans * for having long incomprehensible words because nobody knows any danish ones ? 
  i 'm not even sure where to start or if there is any point in this since you do seem rather [ averse ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bwzqe/belgian_baby_starved_to_death_after_parents/dhqoc10/ ) to both providing and receiving reputable sources for your various claims elsewhere in this thread . 
  i * will * however pick on the to me most amusing of your claims and trust me this choice did not come easy . 
   gas is not just a funny joke of nature , it means you can not digest the food properly . 
  if beans cause you to fart , it is not a healthy food for you . 
  the average human being ( yes , that most likely includes you ) farts between 500 and 1.5 l per day . 
  [ here ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=how%20much%20do%20people%20fart%20per%20day ) is a link with lots of sources but [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flatulence#excessive_volume ) also offers an informative starting point . 
  now , as for `` if beans cause you to fart , it is not a healthy food for you '' - here we have to delve deeper into nether regions . 
  i 'll spare you most of the gritty details but in a nutshell ( or rather in your stomach ) it 's based on swallowing air and bacteria ( literally illegal immigrants inside of you ) taking massive dumps while eating your food right there within your body . 
  again both of us could have [ looked that up ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flatulence#cause ) rather easily but i 'll just quote the fun part here :  flatulence-producing foods are typically high in certain polysaccharides , especially oligosaccharides such as inulin . 
  ** those foods include beans , lentils , dairy products , onions , garlic , spring onions , leeks , turnips , swedes , radishes , sweet potatoes , potatoes , cashews , jerusalem artichokes , oats , wheat , and yeast in breads . 
  cauliflower , broccoli , cabbage , brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables that belong to the genus brassica are commonly reputed to not only increase flatulence , but to increase the pungency of the flatus . 
  ** [ citation needed ]  in beans , endogenous gases seem to arise from complex oligosaccharides ( carbohydrates ) that are particularly resistant to digestion by mammals , but are readily digestible by gut flora -- microorganisms ( methane-producing archaea ; methanobrevibacter smithii ) that inhabit the digestive tract . 
  these oligosaccharides pass through the upper intestine largely unchanged , and when they reach the lower intestine , bacteria feed on them , producing copious amounts of flatus . 
  so for one , there 's a list of foods you should probably never touch again because according to you they 're unhealthy and there 's the explanation for why beans make farting more likely : it 's because of dirty nasty bacteria having an orgy with them and feeding their literal shit back to you . 
  yyyyuck !, 
  ps : yes , those bacteria also have orgies when you 're consuming sugar . 
  or livers gifted from hunter gatherers . 
  or plant fat .
