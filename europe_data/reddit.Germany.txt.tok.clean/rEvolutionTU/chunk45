  or * trve * healthy fat which as we now know only comes from animals . 
  and no matter what you eat exactly , the food will * still * make you fart at least half a litre every single day of your life . 
  ... you do realize that by your definitions all vegans will always look unhealthy because you 're not going to accept any healthy looking person as a ` trve vegan ' , right ? 
   animal fat and protein is essential for buiding and maintaining health . 
  vegans can run for years on substance before crashing down . 
  ah , yes , all those great mono - and polyunsaturated fats from a nice chunk of fatty bacon and the * good * protein ( tm ) that only exists in chicken breasts but not in beans or tofu . 
  you ca n't exactly call certain dietary choices `` absurd , unscientific and unhealthy '' while simultaneously proclaiming that specifically ** animal ** fats and proteins are essential to being healthy . 
  durp , i 'm blind . 
  yeah , that 's fair enough . 
  i 'm a bit more practical there i 'd say , i would n't mind at least some supplements if it allows for an overall more sustainable ( or enjoyable ) diet in return . 
  if it keeps you healthy just the same , why not ? 
  most people could probably use * some * kind of supplement but just do n't know about it . 
  i can see your point though , i just do n't think a diet should be exclusively about it being the best for your body . 
  we all make trade-offs , and if some people are happier with occasional meat , no animal products at all or their theoretical dystopian drink of soylent , why not if their diet allows for a similar level of health . 
  the only dietary choices that really grinds my gears are those that are uninformed and/or highly egocentric from either direction , but that 's not exactly exclusive to diets either . 
  based on [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_r1a#/media/file:y-haplogroup_r1_distribution.png ) map and article i 'd guess that saying `` r1a haplogroup is supposed to be considered as slavs '' is pretty wrong . 
  there are groups in india , afghanistan or pakistan with ~ 70 % for example . 
  [ outside of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_r1a#/media/file:y-haplogroup_r1_distribution.png ) you have [ pashtuns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pashtuns ) at 51 % , [ west bengal brahmins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bengali_brahmins ) at 71 % , [ khatris ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khatri ) at 67 % and the [ mohana tribe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mohana_ ( sindhi_tribe \\ ) ) at 71 % for example . 
  that thing definitely got around but i 'm not sure i 'd consider everyone with high percentages * slav * . 
  damn , [ til ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_r1a#geographic_distribution_of_r1a1a ) . 
   probably they 'll move to sweden or germany eventually ha , moving to germany for safety when fleeing from chechnya because of persecution is n't exactly a smart idea . 
  while it 's * probably * not relevant in most scenarios we do have some rather kadyrov/putin-friendly groups around who like spying on refugees from there . 
   here we have mord/murder and dr\u00e5p / manslaughter which both require intent . 
  same over here , mord/totschlag both require intent ( unlike in the netherlands apparently ) . 
  `` fahrl\u00e4ssige t\u00f6tung '' / `` negligent homicide '' is the main thing without intent . 
  i do n't think he mentioned whether * he * himself takes supplements , just that that is what most vegans do . 
  out of curiosity tho : * most * diets people have create deficiencies or result in people having too much of some other things . 
  why are you personally against supplements ? 
  one thing i 'm noticing with people i know is that those who swap to a vegetarian/vegan/less-meat consuming diet start caring a lot more about what 's in their food in general which results in an overall healthier diet in the first place . 
  that alone was enough for some people in my social circle to actually * not * having to take e.g. 
  iron or b12 supplements anymore . 
  vegan diet in general has nothing to do with people looking horrible or not . 
  [ brandan brazier ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/70/2c/ae/702cae9f537395bfd8513f2b0ae72111.jpg ) comes to mind as an example of a vegan athlete . 
  people who eat unhealthy generally look unhealthier . 
  people who do n't do sports do n't look like people who do sports . 
  whether you decide to cut out meat , fish or all animal products from your diet plays a much , much smaller role if it does at all . 
  hell , let 's take the initial argument of `` distributing water to all rooms instead of fixing the leak '' and work from there . 
  the goal of this redistribution is to ensure that * outside * rooms ( border countries ) are n't completely underwater because then your entire house ( the eu ) is going to get fucked up with no chance at fixing it . 
  if border countries `` break '' in some way shape or form the entire thing falls down like a house of cards . 
  if you redistribute them you relieve pressure and give border countries room to work . 
  `` fixing the leak '' aka controlling the influx is a ** completely separate topic ** . 
  it 's not about * either * fixing the leak * or * redistributing the water , it 's about making sure that the people in the rooms with leaks do n't drown which is kind of a prerequisite if you want to both fix the leak and to not sacrifice the people who have been living in the same house since decades . 
   italy could and didnt wanted to fund it alone . 
  so they asked for money and the eu didnt gave it . 
  then the eu wanted to do their own naval blockade but way thiner and with less boats . 
  now we have immigrants . 
  cliffnotes : italy * did * get money from the eu for mare nostrum . 
  the eu wanted to give more aid but no consensus could be reached hence a voluntary program was the result . 
  the reason it is `` way thinner '' is because it 's not primarily a search and rescue operation - which mare nostrum was by the way . 
  immigrant numbers via that route went ** down ** as a result . 
  ____ first : italy received eu funds for [ operation mare nostrum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_mare_nostrum ) :  the european commission provided financial support for the operation with $ 1.8 million from the external borders fund . 
  italy [ requested more funds than this ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/italy-is-about-to-shut-down-the-sea-rescue-operation-that-saved-more-than-90000-migrants-this-year ) which to my knowledge did n't happen because some countries opposed it strongly . 
  the operation cost italy 9mil $ / month and went from 18th october 2013 till 31st october 2014 . 
  during the one year of mare nostrum 150.000 + people were rescued and brought to italy . 
  ________ because , at least to my knowledge , of eu countries disagreeing on whether to assist italy further or not the followup operation you 're talking about , [ operation triton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_triton ) is a completely * voluntarily project * with the following countries contributing : croatia , iceland , finland , norway , sweden , germany , the netherlands , france , spain , ireland , portugal , austria , switzerland , romania , poland , lithuania and malta . 
  other eu countries did not want to contribute . 
  the operation started with 2.9 mil $ / month budget with seven ships , four airplanes and one helicopter and was extended to 18 ships , three airplanes and two helicopters in april 2015 . 
  the important distinction that needs to be made is while operation mare nostrum had ** rescue ** as the primary focus the prime objective of operation triton is ** border security against illegal immigrants ** . 
  triton primarily operates within 30nm of the italian coast ( at least according to angelino alfano ) and is not primarily focused on search and rescue operation . 
  ** as a direct result the amount of incoming refugees via the mediterranean route went down and deaths at sea went up by 1600 % . 
  ** noteworthy the amount of refugees went [ up in 2016 ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/central-mediterranean-route/ ) again but if we consider the rise in death toll at the same time the reason for this is n't because `` the eu naval blockade brings in migrants '' but because the total number of ships increased drastically . 
  i 'd love if you 'd look some more into this because the overall german-speaking stance i 'm aware of is similar enough that you might be mixing it up just a bit and they could be the exact same . 
  * helmets reduce head injuries in cases of accidents . 
  ** if ** you get into an accident where you hit your head then on average you 're much better off with a helmet than without one . 
  however : * only 5-10 % of bicycle accidents involve head injuries . 
  * cyclists make up less than 1 % of the total head injuries compared to people using cars ( 48 % ) and motorcycle drivers ( 13 % ) the big ones : * a law mandating to use helmets massively reduces the amount of people that ride their bike - which leads to * more * accidents per cyclist since car drivers are simply less used to them being around . 
  * health benefits overall , even though this implies a bit cynical weighing of `` do we want people to be healthier overall or injure their heads more often ? '', 
  other minor factors : * some accidents are made worse by wearing a helmet . 
  * people might drive riskier if they wear one * a helmet that 's worn incorrectly or a wrong helmet entirely can offer barely any protection and people mandated to wear one are more likely to screw up here . 
  _____ tl ; dr : pretty big difference between discouraging a * legal requirement * and discouraging * helmet usage in general * . 
  is this similar for you guys ? 
   and it is as far right as you can before becoming fascist and/or nationalist over here that 's our [ csu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_social_union_in_bavaria ) , the exclusively bavarian version that replaces merkels cdu there . 
  a [ former leader of them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_josef_strauss ) , famous also for massively losing to kohl during his time on a national level , coined the phrase `` rechts von der csu darf es keine demokratisch legitimierte partei geben '' - `` there can not be a democratically legitimate party further right than the csu '' . 
   for the first time in nearly over 50 years the ps had a candidate that was actually socialist and the leftist shunned him for a populist or macron why * did * hamon crash so hard after he became the primary candidate over valls ? 
  polls looked like he had a decent shot at this thing before that event . 
  i 'm not sure about alcohol but for [ smoking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torches_of_freedom#1990s_resurgence ) tobacco companies very specifically targeted women in the 1990s which pretty much doubled smoking women of some agegroups in some countries :  in spain they use images of women in masculine jobs , such as a fighter pilot , to appeal to young women -- and the smoking rates among young women in spain increased from 17 % in 1978 to 27 % in 1997 . 
   in the 1990s germany was a focus for advertising and between 1993 and 1997 the smoking rates among women aged 12 -- 25 in germany went from 27 % to 47 % even though the increase in men 's smoking for the same age group is much smaller . 
   a survey by the japanese ministry of health and welfare showed that between 1986 and 1999 smoking among women had increased from 10.5 % to 23.2 % . 
  that 's true , but out of context for this specifically since eu law goes quite a bit further than that . 
  now , i 'm not a lawyer and i presume neither are you but to my knowledge [ 2011/95/eu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=oj:l:2011:337:0009:0026:en:pdf ) and especially [ 2004/83/ec ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:32004l0083:en:html ) are what 's relevant in this case . 
  in a nutshell , to my understanding , between the civil war ( which includes religious extremists from various side with the associated threats and prosecutions ) , the assad regime and the general `` lawless '' state of lots of areas some of these narrower definitions become relevant . 
  it 's noteworthy however that for example only a very small percentage ( less than 1 % ) of e.g. 
  refugees coming to germany are classified under german * asylum * laws since they 're not considered politically persecuted . 
  most of them are classified as * refugees * with definitions based on the above eu treaties . 
  this * also * means that they are granted a three year stay followed by a re-evaluation of the situation which means that if the war is over in syria , they will have to return . 
  it 's not like actual asylum which , again i might be wrong here , is much less strings attached in comparison . 
  overall you definitely are right though - the vast , vast majority do not fall under the more specific definitions of the treaties you 're mentioning . 
  `` being from a war torn country '' in itself is n't grounds for refugee status even according to the eu treaties mentioned above , so i 'm sorry for being vague here . 
  that claim is [ still not true ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) even if you keep repeating it . 
  again , this is in no way shape or form about any `` mess '' in any country that voluntarily took refugees . 
  it 's about refugees that ** eu border countries ca n't handle ** . 
  that `` mess '' can only be cleaned up by the eu as a whole which includes everyone being useful in some way shape or form . 
  do you just want to wall off italy or greece and tell them to deal with it because it 's not the problem of anyone else ? 
   i agree , but i dont think we should leave them alone with this problem . 
  i am all for aiding ( personnel , financial , humanitarian , etc. ), 
  italy and greece , just not in the single way the eu is focusing on . 
  imo migrant relocation is not a solution considering what has been going on in the last 2 years . 
  i think the basic conundrum is that e.g. 
  italy has been complaining about this since 2002 but no one cared to help until it was * literally * too late . 
  and by that time no common plan existed , help was only voluntarily ( where half the eu declined to help ) and overall shit like that .
