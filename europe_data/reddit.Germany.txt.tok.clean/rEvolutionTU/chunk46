  the relocation is n't a solution , but more of a basic start . 
  it * also * gives countries leverage - e.g. 
  accept it under the condition that joint border efforts must be forced on all countries . 
   not to mention the vast majority of these relocated migrants will go to germany/sweden . 
  from my point of view that 's bullshit as well . 
  that kind of situation is ** the ** chance to say : `` if you do n't even accept how the eu handles this for personal gain you 're first to get shipped back because you 're clearly here for $ $ '' but e.g. 
  germany just * accepting * people that were already redistributed is also a thing that ca n't happen . 
   i think its from an oecd index from last year . 
  [ this one ? 
  ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/poland/ ) that does n't even mention a top 20 for overall safety or `` feeling safe walking alone at night '' and a top 19 for homicide rate . 
  am i missing something ? 
   not true at all . 
  deals are made because they are beneficial for both sides . 
  for example the eu 2004 expansion - it was a business and political deal , it was done because both sides gain from it , not out of the goodness of eu 's heart . 
  yes , you 're right from that angle we can frame any action taken as mutually beneficial in the end . 
  it kinda should have the same result though . 
  if we leave border countries alone with refugees they 're dealing with then we 're willingly excluding them from the eu as a whole and are putting ourselves in danger at the same time , it 's a loss all around . 
  so [ this ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/poland/ ) report ? 
   in poland , 66 % of people say that they feel safe walking alone at night , less than the oecd average of 68 % . 
  - rank 25 . 
  for homicide rate poland is rank 19 . 
  overall rating for safety is 7.5 and not even in the top 20 on that list . 
   i do n't know why you 're obsessed with poland 's demographics , either . 
  why do you care if they stay homogenous ? 
  if refugees are as great as you advocate , you should be happy that you can take more . 
  i have no interests in taking refugees or not taking refugees . 
  i ** do ** have an interest that refugees on eu soil are dealt with as a union and are n't left as the burden of border states - which includes distributing them properly . 
   then dissolve germany , dissolve eu , dissolve everything . 
  let 's live in anarchy where we 're all `` people '' . 
  the concept of nations works without treating people based on where they 're born or who their parents are just the same . 
   small numbers of immigrants are manageable , millions of muslims will break you , destroy your world . 
  there are lots of positions between `` take everyone , open borders ! '', 
  and `` take no one because screw refugees '' . 
  both positions are equally out of touch with reality . 
  i do n't have any interest in taking or not taking migrants . 
  what i ** do ** have an interest in is that border countries are n't left alone with issues like refugees on their soil . 
  if italy , greece or any other member state ca n't handle the influx the eu ** needs ** to be able to step in . 
  that includes strengthening borders * and * redistributing those who are legitimate refugees . 
   he meant germany 's very loose asylum policies , which have been consistent for years now , including before 2015 . 
  if he referred to loose asylum policies in general , he could have clarified that himself i 'm pretty sure . 
  it does speak volumes however when your best argument to base insults on is based on a specific interpretation of something that literally has multiple meanings . 
  that kind of scenario is a [ benno ohnesorg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benno_ohnesorg ) waiting to happen . 
  just in that case he was a protester against the state visit of the shah of iran and got shot after the protest turned violent due to provocations by the shah 's agents and overreactions of the police . 
  that event is a pretty major reason as for why we have so damn many policemen at every similar occasion ( including [ football matches ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uus3pare9xg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1232 ) ) ever since . 
  more than 40 years after this event we found out that the policeman who shot him was a secret agent of the [ stasi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stasi ) , an organisation which would have loved nothing more but for these protests to escalate way more than they already did . 
  _______ e : for some more context what happened back then is obviously a bit different from this current scenario . 
  it 's * mostly * accurately depicted in [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfuyzhk5he0 ) scene from the movie '' [ the baader meinhof complex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_baader_meinhof_complex ) '' . 
  in [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzihltryq24&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=921 ) scene with actual footage from when it happened the initial clash can be seen while in [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlgkeuqzrfw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=171 ) video the police reinforcements ( who , just like in the current scenario , were n't where they were needed initially ) pushing into both protesters and agents of the shah are clearly visible . 
  the gist is that two sides ready for violence without police that is well-trained and around in strong numbers is a recipe for disaster . 
  what kind of narrative is this ? 
  the uk are * still * close geographically and ideologically . 
  if they 're doing well , that 's a good thing . 
   problem is in eu the only way is german way so accept unlimited immigrants for merkel to look good or else . 
  oh come on , the eu is not a monarchy or dictatorship . 
  last time germany and france wanted a stronger frontex it was poland and hungary who blocked it because `` but our sovereign borders '' . 
  when the choice was between military action against refugees and introducing laws that were n't sure to stand in front of german and eu courts she decided against those measures . 
  because yes , she 'd have looked bad by authorizing things that would have been against the majority opinion in germany . 
  why not both ? 
  i think those are separate albeit related topics . 
   that was not the plan . 
  plan was to relocate unlimited numbers for years to come . 
  that 's not what the article talks about though . 
  sorry if i misunderstood you somewhere . 
   also italy should stop that ferry service form libyan coast . 
  hard to talk about help when italians and ngos are bringing daily thousands of people in . 
  same idea really : deal with it on an eu level , take pressure of italy and give the eu as a whole a way to respond to it and be responsible . 
  by leaving it as the sole job of italy everyone involved is hurting themselves and it 's intransparent as hell . 
  i think that 's an extremely simplified way to look at it and i 'm not sure if there is a clear answer . 
  to me the approach needs to be extremely wide overall : opportunities for integration and assimilation need to exist just as much as harsh but fair treatment of those who break the rules . 
  overall for germany for example italian , polish or turkish immigration were success stories - despite the costs involved because the majority turned out to be just fine on a large scale . 
  nevertheless the majority of germans was against for example italian migration because it `` costs too much '' , `` they 'll take our jobs '' and all the other arguments . 
  overall i agree with your main point , it 's just that it 's * probably * impossible to appropriately judge without looking at ten , twenty or fifty years of history that we do n't have yet in all cases . 
  for the cases where we ** do ** have them ( turks are probably the closest , iranians maybe second ) they overall had a much more positive and beneficial impact than a negative one . 
  there 's no choice but to ** make ** it work . 
  lock those up who try to circumvent these approaches and ensure they 're the first sent back once the war is over if that 's what it takes . 
  there 's something to lose right there . 
  if we do n't redistribute them like this then border countries are * literally * fucked and by extension the next countries in line and so on . 
  there 's simply no realistic option that i 'm aware of once they 're on eu soil besides such a system . 
  if we ca n't make it work we might as well have every nation build walls around itself again and tell the others to get bent . 
   but keeping by force people who do n't want to be there is german ill advised plan . 
  pushing it suggests the real goal is to fracture eu . 
  why do you think so ? 
  to me the gist is this : once people are on eu soil they 're an eu problem and we ca n't let e.g. 
  italy or greece deal with it by themselves which * actually * fractures the eu . 
  we also ca n't rely on other countries voluntarily helping out since that can lead back to the border countries being left alone . 
  based on that the only remaining possibility is to redistribute them among the eu member states in such a scenario . 
  if we distribute them while respecting family ties , family units , languages spoken and so on and they end up not respecting the areas they 're assigned to we can treat that as what it is : non-compliance because of economical reasons . 
  * then * we need to enforce that countries like germany ca n't just give them asylum anyway when they already showed such a distinct disregard for pretty much the only way the eu can handle such an issue . 
  can you imagine the clusterfuck if every nation would have to have their own can of coke that does n't remind people of somebody else 's version ? 
  i guess we * could * print flags across it but still . 
   now it 's not really european problem because germany decided to grant them all asylum , it 's german problem . 
  you can cry as much you want but it all comes down to whether other countries want those mena migrants , do you think they want them ? 
  it 's ** still ** not about a single person who got granted asylum in germany . 
  it 's about a ** general procedure on what to do with refugees on eu soil ** . 
  and that 's a collective problem that the border countries ca n't be left alone with . 
   true , but i do n't see poland , or any eastern european country in general being in favor of redistribution so it 's fair to make that assumption on relying on prior knowledge ... and that 's is a completely unacceptable stance in a * union * that shares * open inner borders * . 
  if people entered the eu , they 're a collective problem that needs to be handled collectively . 
   you know what germany did when you caught them ? 
  gave them asylum and let them stay . 
  despite the fact that our authorities were willing to take them .
