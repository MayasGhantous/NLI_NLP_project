  nobody was returned . 
  yeah , i think that 's just as out of line . 
  overall the direction i 'm coming from is that the smart approach is n't removing these kinds of quotas because that 'd just isolate countries with genuine issues even more and fracture the eu as a whole . 
  instead we need acceptance of the quotas and raise a shit storm when they 're not respected - * including * when germany just lets them stay after crossing the border . 
  there 's nothing to lose for the countries they 're relocated to here besides `` lol bureaucracy '' . 
  the solution to murders happening is n't to make them legal either . 
  it 's to raise hell because it 's the job of authorities to deal with them according to the rules we have . 
   they agreed to 300k , not 2 or 3 million or anything between . 
  if you want to redistribute from that 300k according to deal made for other circumstances then you need to make up another deal . 
  which 300k ? 
  the article talks about ** 100k total ** . 
  apart from that , there 's no real point in a discussion if you 're ignoring arguments that the other side makes . 
  again : ** both ** a country being able to bring virtually unlimited people into the eu ** and ** a country refusing to help other eu members who are dealing with refugees because of their geographical location is something i consider unacceptable . 
   play by the rules set by who ? 
  and for what ? 
  the situation has changed from the deal that was made for 300k , if germany accepts all economic migrants and realizes that they cant integrate them then tough luck , it 's not up to eu to clean up your mess . 
  see first point : this is about redistributing 100k from italy and greece to help them out . 
  it 's interesting that you 're trying to spin it into people germany accepted that * germany * now wants the eu to take care of however . 
  neither sweden nor germany are even mentioned in the article . 
   so basically it 's a symbollic gesture for you ? 
  never mind that the system is broken and does n't work , the only important thing is that we show solidarity and can feel like we 've done the right thing . 
  never mind that the refugees have no interests whatosever in staying in cee countries . 
  if they 're not accepting the locations they 're assigned to we can look at this as what it is : non-compliance because of economical interests . 
  if they 're informed about this procedure beforehand and we consider things like family units , language skills or similar things when we figure out the places where people are relocated to i see that as something beneficial . 
  that 's how i 'd look at it . 
  we * need * to redistribute in a scenario like this in general because solidarity but we * also * need to be harsh and fair when they 're showing behavior that goes beyond what these mechanics intend to offer : safety and refuge first and foremost . 
  to me personally that 's a great way to distinguish between the type of people everyone involved wants to stick around and the type of people everyone involved is skeptic about . 
   redistribution itself would not work since unless you forcibly prevent them leaving they would just go to germany in less than a week , as they have so far when they 've been relocated to other poor countries . 
  great , them not accepting the location they 're not assigned to should be seen as what it is : non-compliance that does n't work in their favor . 
   you can take and accept as much you want , do n't expect others taking them from you when you realize it 's not a good idea . 
  why should ** any ** eu country be able to take as many people as they want with no limits whatsoever ? 
  that 's again a completely ridiculous idea , just as the opposite of border countries being left alone with the issue . 
   no they 're just problem for germany and sweden , migrants themselves do n't care about other countries . 
  sweden and germany both are aging societies , they need a lot more migrants and there 's never ending influx coming from mena countries so i do n't see a problem here . 
  you mean after they were a problem for italy , greece or hungary right ? 
  fact remains : any individual within eu borders that does n't play by the rules is a problem for all eu member states . 
  i would n't call either nation * eager to redistribute * . 
  we 're talking about relocating 100k out of 2 million total here . 
  that 's neither going to make a dent in the total of people germany took nor in eu member states they 're suppose to be relocated to as a whole . 
  according to this article it 's about an agreement from september 2015 , so it 's more like `` remember this thing you agreed to 1.5 years ago ? 
  yeah , it 's still not fulfilled . '', 
  - that 's also not really a `` hurry '' either . 
  to me personally it 's more important as a precedent - member states ca n't be left alone with that burden . 
  i think the idea that germany * could * take so many proportionally is just as much something that ca n't happen again as them not being distributed evenly in the first place . 
  they 're a problem for the union as a whole after all from the second they 're within eu borders , no matter how you spin it . 
   brilliant , except the eu does not share borders with syria or iraq . 
  by your own definition , this is not a european responsibility . 
  it 's the responsibility of israel , saudi arabia , and turkey . 
  the moment they leave those refuges for better standards of living , they cease to be refugees and become economic migrants . 
  alright , what if turkey tells them to move on and refuses to take any back . 
  build a wall and shoot everyone who tries to cross ? 
  are we going to make the people * fleeing * responsible for turkeys policies ? 
   agreed . 
  now if only we could stop certain dominant eu members from ignoring that and sending out mass invitations for migrants ... oh the '' [ invitation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ftggcy.png ) '' again . 
  [ [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) ]  why does there need to be a supernational body ? 
  why is giving up more sovereignty a necessity to secure the borders ? 
  what is wrong with simply coordinating a multinational eu effort to give help to those members who need it ? 
  cooperation is the answer here , not orwellian ` supernationalism ' . 
  because the last time we tried coordinating a voluntary multinational eu effort half the countries said `` lol not our problem let border countries deal with it '' . 
  we have countries ** blocking ** your proposal right now . 
  overall i personally do n't have any interest on whether it 's pure cooperation or coordinated by a supernational body . 
  the latter would most likely both be cheaper and much more efficient however . 
    re-evaluation of how refugees are handled in general . 
  the solution to , as a random example , a civil war in the us ca n't be expecting mexico and canada to shelter 300 million people . 
   why is that an unreasonable expectation ? 
  because past a certain amount you * literally * ca n't take more people without massively threatening your own population . 
  1 % , 5 % , maybe even 10 % , sure . 
  maybe a bit more than that . 
  but you ca n't just add theoretically infinite amounts and keep expecting it to work out . 
  here , have some more detailed maps from germany . 
  notably , this does not say that migrants make lives ` better ' in some way shape or form but it * does * go against the idea that crime rates are low and unemployment is low * because * of few foreigners in an area .

  note that bavaria , the state in the bottom left ( ba-w\u00fc ) and the state in the middle-center ( nrw ) are responsible for 50 % + of the total german gdp .

  the areas with high poverty rates are more xenophobic , have less jobs , they even have less women born between [ 83 and 87 ] ( http://www.daburna.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/deutschlandkarte_sexualproportion_20bis24jaehrige.jpg ) and born between [ 73 and 77 ] ( http://www.daburna.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/deutschlandkarte_sexualproportion_30bis34jaehrige.jpg ) . 
   we are the second safest country in the world after japan , that 's thanks to our homogeneity . 
  i 'm seeing that claim quite a bit in this thread , what 's the source on this ? 
  homicide rate , [ place 21 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) - crime index , [ place 30 ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp ) is what i 'm able to find quickly . 
   it 's our country , and we want it to stay polish and be for poles first . 
  if every single nation puts their national interests first we would n't have an eu . 
  google `` polska dla polak\u00f3w '' or feel free to google `` deutschland den deutschen '' and look at images for these searches to see what kind of ideology you 're advocating here . 
  all just concerned citizens , eh ? 
  what annoys me so damn much is that * this exact argument * has been used against polish people over here since decades . 
  they have a different culture , they 're here to steal our jobs ( and because they want free welfare because schr\u00f6dingers pole is obviously a thing ) , they do n't want to learn our language , they 're only mingling with each other and do n't want to integrate , they 're all alcoholics . 
  `` wan na know why russians need to always steal two cars in germany ? 
  because they have to go through poland on the way back . '', 
  - shit like this is funny when you mention it once , it 's not as funny anymore when you realize the far-right * genuinely believes this image * . 
  it 's all . 
  we have amazing people with polish or ukrainian origin living here . 
  we have amazing people with turkish , french or italian origins living here . 
  and we * also * have some syrians living here who are pretty damn amazing already . 
  - and we also have shitty people with german , polish , turkish or whatever origin living here . 
  & nbsp ; people are just people . 
  screw those who commit crimes against local rules but everyone fundamentally deserves an equal chance at success in our societies . 
  no matter their race , color of skin , religion , original culture or passport . 
  the exact same people who are telling people like you that this blanket stance against refugees or migrants is xenophobic as hell and should not be tolerated are those who did the exact same to people with the exact same stance against ** your ** people . 
  you 're not just polish , i 'm not just german and a syrian is n't just syrian . 
  we 're all * people * that , once we 're able to communicate this to each other , turn out to have rather similar basic interests and needs .
