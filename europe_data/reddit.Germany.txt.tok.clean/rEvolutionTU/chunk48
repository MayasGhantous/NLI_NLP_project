  dude , italy has been having issues since the early [ 2000s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lampedusa_immigrant_reception_center ) with this . 
  financial aid was n't enough , aid with manpower was a ** voluntary effort ** because the eu could n't agree on it being necessary and we have countries actively blocking more power to some kind of joint eu border control . 
  it 's ** really ** not as easy as `` just throw some money at italy , greece or bulgaria '' . 
  because internationally nations agreed that if someone flees from a war torn country you offer refuge . 
  that 's why border countries ca n't blankly send them away . 
  once they 're ** in ** the eu they 're a european problem that ca n't be brushed off to border states . 
  what we need in order : * pretty much unconditional unity that eu borders are a ** common ** problem for every single member state . 
  * border states willing to at least jointly work on the security of outer eu borders with some type of supranational body . 
  yes , this includes giving up some national sovereignty . 
  * re-evaluation of how refugees are handled in general . 
  the solution to , as a random example , a civil war in the us ca n't be expecting mexico and canada to shelter 300 million people . 
   but the quality of the food should be the same . 
  hmm ... how do you propose to regulate that ? 
  i fully agree that the cases mentioned in the op are massive issues because * quality * should be similar if they 're packaged the same but how exactly do we differentiate quality from taste ? 
  for example i can buy coke in france , the us and brazil and get three different tasting products with differences in ingredients ** and quality ** . 
  if i remember correctly things like fanta have varying juice content across the eu for example . 
  we * could * force different packaging for * any * different usage of ingredients but that 's impractical as hell . 
  we could regulate more specific names ( stuff like feta \u2122 is awesome ) , but that has limits . 
  we could regulate * every single piece of food with ingredients that can vary * but yeah , not happening . 
  how do you genuinely ** do ** this kind of thing in practice ? 
  i have a really hard time coming up with something beyond informing consumers and giving them the choice to not buy overpriced and low-quality products . 
  but even that is thin ice because brand recognition is based on associating the product with a different level of quality . 
   but know you know at least some relevant people in germany see things the way you do . 
  is n't that a good thing ? 
  you 're basically complaining that you 're beeing informed about the position of relevant people on the subject . 
  yeah , from that angle you 're definitely right . 
  i think what i have a problem with overall is that it 's a german mp most germans * probably * have no connection with stuck between a `` senior european intelligence official '' and `` the kremlin '' which in context makes it look like there is much more weight behind such a statement than there really is . 
   it 's one of those pages that is updated with raw information as new stuff is happening . 
  like a news ticker , but just for a specific subject . 
  hence the timestamps for each sections . 
  have you never seen one of these before ? 
  news websites have been doing this for ages . 
  i mean , sure , but with that kind of headline ? 
  if `` the latest on the report that president donald trump shared classified information with russian officials ( all times edt ) : '' would be the red primary headline i 'd have much less of an issue with this . 
  okay , help me out here . 
  the * primary * headline of any page ( here in red ) should offer a summary of the entire subject and catch the readers eye . 
  the * secondary * headline should offer a bit more detail , build more attention and lead into the main subject ( here opened with `` washington ( ap ) -- '' ) . 
  then you offer a list of topics related to the ** primary headline ** . 
  ________ now , for the rocket science part , it actually took me till you wrote it out to get that the idea here is that the primary headline is ** only ** related to the very first point `` a senior european intelligence official '' and not the topic at large . 
  like , look : [ police ticker ] ( http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/nr/104236 ) . 
  date , place , headline , detail . 
  or [ here ] ( http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-krise/ukraine-krise-im-news-ticker-kiew-feiert-den-esc-in-der-ostukraine-gehen-die-kaempfe-weiter_id_7132310.html ) random ukraine ticker which is closer to the ap format : & nbsp ; h1 ( fighting in ukraine , latest news ) picture h2 ( more detail to h1 ) headline ( same size as h2 ) , date , news headline , date , news & nbsp ; if we compare that to the ap ` ticker ' it goes : h1 ( red ) h2 ( washington ( ap ) time , news time , news & nbsp ; they 're ** still all under h1 and h2 ** . 
  i 'm doubting my sanity a bit here , to me i can understand how the format is * meant * but the layout does n't convey this at all to me . 
  what i see are dozens of individual small bits that stand under two primary headlines . 
  ... do you see where i 'm coming from now ? 
  this has been going on since the early [ 2000s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lampedusa_immigrant_reception_center ) . 
  since that time countries like italy kept mentioning that this issue needs to be addressed but no one * really * cared since they could handle it . 
  when they slowly could n't handle it anymore we had things like [ operation mare nostrum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_mare_nostrum ) in 2013/2014 which was again a purely italian operation but with additional eu funds ( with help from slovenia but yeah ) . 
  things like [ operation triton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_triton ) that came way too late ( 2014 ) were done on a voluntary basis because the eu could n't agree on helping italy as a whole . 
  just throwing money at italy and greece does n't solve the issue for obvious reasons . 
  agreements on what to * do * with these people could n't be reached on an eu level , again it was an italian and greece and other nations problems until they could n't handle it anymore . 
  resources such as manpower and vehicles could only be done on a * voluntary basis * because half the eu could n't agree that it 's needed . 
  [ here ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/italy-is-about-to-shut-down-the-sea-rescue-operation-that-saved-more-than-90000-migrants-this-year ) is a bit more detail on the entire mess , the tl ; dr is that the eu as a whole either ca n't agree or does n't have the capabilities to offer assistance because ( literally ) `` muh sovereignty '' . 
  actual efforts to turn [ frontex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex#european_border_and_coast_guard_agency_.282016-.29 ) into something proper instead of the underfunded mess it is were for example also blocked . 
  a solution to this is ** only ** possible if non-border countries agree on offering pretty much unconditional assistance to border countries and if border countries allow the eu to be involved in efforts when it comes to external borders . 
  it 's not like our efforts in the region are exactly * helping * , it 's for example us western nations that are responsible for killing off any chance at a textile industry by literally dumping our clothes there . 
   the majority of the growth ( in humans ) is such no education system can keep up . 
  50 % of the population is under the age of 15 . 
  these countries were richer 50 years ago . 
  you mean like exactly what happened in other nations ? 
  the population in england doubled between 1750 and 1850 . 
  most of the world did n't arrive at [ these fertility rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/projections_of_population_growth#/media/file:countriesbyfertilityrate.svg ) by random chance but with medical progress and education . 
  we had our industrial revolution , the americas had it , asia had it . 
  the baseline of all practices should be to help africa help themselves get through it as best as we can but this * includes * accepting their growth just as much as the world had no chance but to accept ours . 
   still , just because you 've never heard of him before does n't mean he is n't relevant . 
  he is a senior law-maker involved with intelligence agencies , that much is true , and how these people see things does matters . 
  i 'm not saying he 's irrelevant , i 'm saying it 's a complete neutral quote from someone who sounds much more major in the short news bit than he actually is . 
   the headline , that european countries might halt intel-sharing . . well , that is n't based on what lischka said . 
  that was someone else . 
   so . . the problem is on your side again , not the news-site  is it ? 
   washington ( ap ) -- the latest on the report that president donald trump shared classified information with russian officials ( ** all times edt ** ) : all of the following is related to trump sharing classified info . 
  now , the primary headline above this secondary headline picks a specific bit and goes further into detail based on * one * of the following reports . 
  if anything that 's rather bad practice in general , which i * suspect * has something to do with the specific link overall that does n't look exactly like something that was intended to be looked at in detail . 
  but * even if * we just see the quotes by lischka in the context of `` the latest on the report that president donald trump shared classified information with russian officials '' they 're * still * completely neutral statements that do n't really add anything besides `` we do n't know if it 's true but if it 's true it 's bad '' . 
   it interesting you say that , but that is exactly what happened after 1945 with denazification process . 
  thousands of german governmental employees , civil servants , soldiers were excluded from the political process for association with the nazis . 
  you * do * realize that the de-nazification was a complete failure in this regard , right ? 
  i [ just had a longer discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bg50l/in_a_remarkable_case_17_year_old_is_first_woman/dhn5fph/ ) with another american , so i 'm not sure if this is something that got lost in history somewhere . 
  the vast , vast majority of people involved with the nazi party in post-war germany were allowed to work again after a few years . 
  here just some basic quotes from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denazification ) , more can be found in the reply linked above . 
   as denazification was deemed ineffective and counterproductive by the americans , they did not oppose the plans of the west german chancellor , konrad adenauer , to end the denazification efforts . 
  adenauer 's intention was to switch government policy to reparations and compensation for the victims of nazi rule ( wiedergutmachung ) , stating that the main culprits had been persecuted . 
   in 1951 several laws were passed , ending the denazification . 
  officials were allowed to retake jobs in the civil service , with the exception of people assigned to group i ( major offenders ) and ii ( offenders ) during the denazification review process . 
   several amnesty laws were also passed which affected about 792,176 people . 
  those pardoned included people with six-month sentences , 35,000 people with sentences of up to one year and include more than 3,000 functionaries of the sa , the ss , and the nazi party who participated in dragging victims to jails and camps ; 20,000 other nazis sentenced for `` deeds against life '' ( presumably murder ) ; 30,000 sentenced for causing bodily injury , and 5,200 who committed `` crimes and misdemeanors in office . '', 
  as a result , several people with a former nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of western germany . 
  ** that ** is part of the reason why the de-nazification was so successful . 
  the us , especially with things like the berlin airlift or the marshall plan in general , built itself up not as an enemy but an ally . 
  i 'm not sure if most americans are aware of * why * west germany and by extension germany was so loyal to the us for such a long time . 
  it certainly was n't because all people related to the nazi party never got any jobs again . 
  =p i genuinely do n't mean this in the classic `` lol uneducated ` murican '' - context condescending , i 'm curious because i just had this discussion twice in a row : is all the above not well-known info in the us ? 
  the de-nazififaction , as planned by the us , was , in a nutshell , a complete failure and measures were very quickly massively pulled back . 
  here is an example from the french zone :  because teachers had been strongly nazified , the french began by removing three-quarters of all teachers from their jobs . 
  however , finding that the schools could not be run without them , they were soon rehired , although subject to easy dismissal . 
  a similar process governed technical experts . 
   the french were the first to turn over the vetting process to germans , while maintaining french power to reverse any german decision . 
  overall , the business of denazification in the french zone was considered a `` golden mean between an excessive degree of severity and an inadequate standard of leniency , '' laying the groundwork for an enduring reconciliation between france and germany . 
  in the french zone only thirteen germans were categorized as `` major offenders . '', 
  _________ the difference to the de-ba ` athification is that one oppressive regime was changed into another under the guise of `` giving people democracy '' , with no real guidance as to how to deal with having to include and protect a minority .
