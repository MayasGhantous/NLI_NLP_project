  hell , you could n't even go to a university without being a party member . 
  why on earth would you punish people for that ? 
   however , it is important that we recognize the agency of the people who created isis . 
  they are human beings , not merely machines reacting to things . 
  they could have chosen differently and that is an important fact that we should acknowledge . 
  and the vast , vast majority of people who got screwed over in this process did n't choose this path . 
  if we just look at the 500k soldiers without jobs and assume 10k joining the islamic state of iraq ( 4x the estimate from the wiki article ) then that 's a whooping 2 % of people affected . 
  ... which in this specific example means 98 % got screwed over without later being involved with the so-called is directly . 
  it 's obviously a weak example since there are dozens of other militant groups , but you get the gist of the idea when we look at the most prominent group directly . 
   that 's fucking ridiculous and should be stopped . 
  no idea how though . 
  just like it was stopped in europe , the us or at the latest countries like bangladesh and brazil : education , medical standards and * time * . 
  all countries that reach a certain standard of living seem to peak out around 2 kids per family . 
  the basic issue is that africa has been behind for such a long time that the difference seems massive , when in reality they 're in the process of catching up . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=537 ) is a pretty good graphical representation of the issue - the gist is that it will be ~ 40-50 years till they get to the same level . 
   so if germany and sweden want and create situation where immigrants come in excess , why should other countries start bearing the burden ? 
  time to link [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ftggcy.png ) graph again . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) thread . 
  would you prefer if only italy and greece bear the burden because they 're border states and that 's what makes it their problem ? 
  ** if ** refugees get into the eu then it 's a common problem . 
  that 's where quotas are the only reasonable way of dealing with it . 
  now , if you 'd like to argue that they should n't be in the eu to begin with that 's an entirely different topic and one that most likely would require changes to fundamental ( and partly international ) treaties all eu members agree upon when they joined the union . 
  the gist is that once they 're within eu states they 're an eu problem . 
  the whole thing only got so bad in the first place because border states were ignored for years . 
   the idea that the middle east would be stable if the us was not there is an unproven assertion . 
  question : do you think that [ ensuring that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-ba'athification#impact ) 500k soldiers and 150k + governmental employees , civil servants , teachers and doctors lost their jobs and were excluded from the political process in iraq made organizations like the so-called is more or less likely ? 
  this is a ** direct ** consequence of us involvement and ` cleanup ' and it 's oddly close to things like the [ islamic state of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq ) becoming active . 
  if anything we 're incredibly lucky that only a few thousand went to this kind of extreme . 
   he is in the `` parlamental committee for inner security '' source ? 
  he 's one of 37 members in the `` home affairs select committee '' ( innenausschuss ) but not more than that afaik . 
   he is also a member of the `` parlamental controlling-council for intelligence organizations '' ( pkgr ) correct , one of the most criticized control instruments in german politics because it 's completely ineffective at what it 's supposed to do : it needs a [ majority ] ( https://www.bpb.de/dialog/netzdebatte/169068/geheimdienste-ausser-kontrolle-wer-ueberwacht-eigentlich-die-ueberwacher?type=galerie&amp;show=image&amp;i=169091 ) to do its job but by definition the majority is held by whoever controls the government . 
  hence everything this council can do ( watch over intelligence organizations ) can be blocked by the governing parties . 
   and took a big part in the nsa-spying-investigation . 
  as a deputy . 
  but all that aside , even if he is well informed : his statement said nothing more than `` if this claim turns out to be true , then this is worrying '' - `` the president knows a lot of things '' - '' ** if ** trump passes information around freely he is a security risk '' . 
  all of which are completely neutral statements that do n't exactly strengthen the headline claim : european country might halt us intel-sharing . 
   legitimate street gypsies playing `` master of puppets '' by metallica on their stringed instruments ( not guitars , not sure what to call them ) you sure you did n't run into an [ apocalyptica cover band ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph68z6ysqzs ) ? 
   a senior german lawmaker has expressed concern about `` oh , interesting , i wonder who ... ''  burkhard lischka '' ??? '', 
  i 'd link you guys an english wikipedia page but it [ literally does n't exist ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/burkhard_lischka ) . 
  i mean , sure , he 's an mp but i 'd be genuinely surprised if most people even know his name . 
  i sometimes wonder if they literally ask all 600 mps of a country until they find one that says something useful . 
  `` useful '' meaning such an obvious statement such as : `` if it proves to be true that the american president passed on internal intelligence matters that would be highly worrying . '', 
  no shit . 
  i 'd say a major component was n't just that it was partial in general , it was that a ( similar to the de-ba ` athification ) complete purge was * planned * but was simply unrealistic due to the scope and overall homogeneity of the german people in comparison . 
  the us sticking to that concept of the original idea is what i 'm criticizing the most . 
   it 's doubtful to me whether the us could have fundamentally altered culture in iraq and eliminated that kind of tribalism or whether the postwar government would have accepted such ongoing efforts . 
  i agree , i 'm not sure either whether this would have happened . 
  * however , * by ostracizing anyone affiliated with the party in any way shape or form i think it 's safe to say that it encouraged this kind of tribalism , legitimized it even . 
   if the government had been stable and debaathification incomplete , then it presumably would have conducted its own more-conplete purge . 
  to have done what germany had done would have involved a majority that had often had a really unpleasant time of it accepting that now these people could be trusted to not try to oppose them . 
  i think that 's * really * difficult to judge . 
  would a well-liked teacher that joined the party to study be forced from office just as much as anyone else ? 
  we do n't know . 
  to me the us had a clear chance of implementing concepts that good old adenauer and germany as a whole lived as examples : a spirit of reconciliation and transparency . 
  sure , this * could * all just be wishful thinking , but for me what matters is that the underlying us ideology , the idea that only a complete purge can do justice , was the exact same ideology that was behind the plans for the de-nazification - just germans ended up being lucky enough that this was completely unrealistic in their case while iraqis were n't - the majority even welcomed such harsh measures . 
  any western democracy should be aware of the idea that a democracy can only prosper and be ` free ' if minorities are protected , whether they 're ethical , sexual , religious or anything else . 
  overall to me the de-ba ` athification was carried out in stark contrast to these basic principles , there was no real leadership involved in terms of ethics or setting examples . 
   i think that a better example might be trying to get a government composed just of nazis and jews to get along . 
  it 's going to be hard to get either side to trust the other , and whichever side can gain the upper hand seems likely to purge the other for their own security . 
  if you 're `` liberating '' a country because of a dictator with `` weapons of mass destruction '' at the helm with such a scenario in place is the solution to let one side democratically purge the other side or to stay involved until you can be confident that such a thing wo n't be allowed ? 
  i ca n't step in because one side is oppressing the other and then leave when this gets flipped around and pretend i did the best possible job . 
  _________ i 'd actually be * really * curious about polls or the us image in iraq in general nowadays . 
  for germany for example it was pretty much the [ berlin airlift ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_blockade#start_of_the_berlin_airlift ) that to my knowledge and from stories i got told that public image * really * shifted to pro-us . 
  the kids who stopped associating us planes with bombs and started associated us planes with food and supplies back then were the ones cheering on kennedy and his `` ich bin ein berliner '' not even 15 years later . 
  our left and green ( ! ), 
  politicians born around 1950 were the ones who supported the war in afghanistan * because * of that image and the positive associations with the us first and foremost - against the will of the population even . 
  maybe it 's just not talked about in mainstream media , but are there similar things being done in iraq or syria ? 
  i sometimes feel a lot like most americans do n't even * really * know what exactly their governments did that turned germans so ridiculously pro-us that we even had to mention you in the [ german-french friendship agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lys%c3%a9e_treaty#controversy ) . 
   if it uses its monopoly over violence to punish its citizens for expressing certain ( any , in fact ) political views . 
  germany specifically is very clear on the idea that freedom and democracy are not meant to be tools for those who want to see these values disappear . 
  it 's a very distinct approach ( also called a [ militant democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) ) and has one simple goal in mind : when in doubt it 's more important to uphold democratic values and democracy itself than it is to uphold complete freedom of expression . 
  and since you pointed out marxists and left-wingers in another post of yours : yes , this is true for the left just as much as the right . 
  it 's just that the left has n't been as radical as the right since the times of the [ raf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) . 
  i think he got lost somewhere around `` iranian = aryan = bullied by foreigners = aww , fuck it i need a new name . '', 
  i do n't think i ever heard any kind of anti-semitic direction about that case so he might not even have had that connection in his mind . 
   what 's your position on denazification , which did the same thing with the nazi party ? 
  should it have not happened ? 
  it did not happen in the way it was intended , that makes a world of difference here . 
  this is going to be a bit longer since for most of this post i 'll bomb you with wiki quotes from that very article . 
  the gist is that i think it 's safe to say the de-nazification worked because the original plan failed while de-ba ` athification failed because the original plan worked . 
  if we look at the ba'ath - party then every single person involved with the party was banned from public office and completely excluded from the political process . 
  in direct comparison the vast , vast majority of people involved with the nazi party got off with rather light sentences and ended up playing major roles in society again . 
  what this allowed was a slow but steady reconciliation with the past that society could go through as a whole - that among other things is why the student protests in the 70s and onward became such a big deal for west germany specifically . 
  the worst offenders got punished , some others got away low or no punishments at all . 
  under things like the marshall-plan the us instilled an image of not just an enemy but a friend and an ally which germany would stick to all the way to the next century . 
  the us inspired and helped the german people as a whole . 
  meanwhile germans could become really damn efficient ( ha ) at understanding the horrors of the past and overall a climate emerged under which people * wanted * to talk about the past and * wanted * to pass it onto their kids and grandkids to prevent such a thing from ever happening again . 
  & nbsp ; in comparison , every single person involved with the ba'ath - party ( even those who * had * to join to study for example ) got collectively punished for the actions of the party leadership . 
  and now they 're living in a ` democracy ' where the people their former party oppressed are now the oppressors . 
  one oppressive system was exchanged for another and the area as a whole was overall neglected by those involved in its destruction . 
  it seems as if the us as a whole never understood * why * the de-nazification was such a massive success - it sure as hell was n't one because the initial plans were great . 
  & nbsp ; it became something inherent to german culture to not tolerate these elements within society , but that was built on transparency and openness just as much as willingness and interest to understand * how * something like this could happen in the first place . 
  not by removing all elements involved in any way shape or form , pretending it never happened and putting a lid on the entire thing . 
  & nbsp ; quote-dump to substantiate the `` the de-nazification failed as planned '' - argument :  one of the punishments for nazi involvement was to be barred from public office and/or restricted to manual labour or `` simple work '' . 
  at the end of 1945 3.5 million former nazis awaited classification , many of them barred from work in the meantime . 
  by the end of the winter of 1945 -- 46 ** 42 % of public officials ** had been dismissed . 
   as a result of these various pressures , and following a 15 january 1946 report of the military government decrying the efficiency of denazification , saying , `` the present procedure fails in practice to reach a substantial number of persons who supported or assisted the nazis , '' it was decided to involve germans in the process . 
   several new regulations came into effect in the setting up of the german-run tribunals , ** including the idea that the aim of denazification was now rehabilitation rather than merely punishment , and that someone whose guilt might meet the formal criteria could also have their specific actions taken into consideration for mitigation . 
  ** efficiency thus improved , while rigor declined . 
   unless their crimes were serious , ** members of the nazi party born after 1919 were exempted on the grounds that they had been brainwashed .
