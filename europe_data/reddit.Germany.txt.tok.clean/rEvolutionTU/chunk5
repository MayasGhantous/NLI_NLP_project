  2013 it was [ peer steinbr\u00fcck ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/peer_steinbr%c3%bcck ) who i personally just remember as ... bland , boring and as someone who played a part in loads of privatizing after 2008 as minister of finance . 
  not entirely sure though . 
  ________ so basically so far it 's not like we * really * had a choice . 
  was alright since merkel is a thing , would have been pretty terror if not . 
  in comparison to the us you got ta keep in mind though that our political campaigns are much , much more tame ( less money , more regulations , ca n't really paint the opposition evil since you likely have to work with them in the future ) so overall i think our system has an easier time favoring moderate people . 
  also : we only had three chancellors since 1982 ( four since 1974 , you had twice as many presidents ) . 
  we tend to keep the overall decent ones around . 
  can one of you guys post the full text ? 
  ... and electing schulz means the risk of electing people like wagenknecht . 
  i 'm honestly still very much undecided , we 've also got quite some time ahead of us . 
   when everyone is shifting in one direction , going in the exact opposite direction is a dividing factor , not a unifying one . 
  ( ... )  which means that concerns currently pushing europe to the right will remain unaddressed , and current trends of nationalism will accelerate . 
  i highly disagree . 
  schulz does n't just represent a `` shift '' in the opposite direction , he represents a different angle on the same issues . 
  where merkel stands for slow , rational and careful decisions after waiting as long as possible schulz , at this point in time , to me , stands for more action and taking clear stances . 
  if anything that 's * the * perspective to `` counter '' a nationalistic shift : reminding people that without action , without a common perspective european nations are at risk of losing the peace and prosperity they 're taking for granted . 
  from what i 've heard so far schulz is much harsher on issues he deems valuable than most which is something i prefer to the idea of trying to appease as many nations in the eu as possible . 
  a line needs to be established and followed . 
  common solutions need to be found and enforced . 
   i mean , look at it this way , would you honestly prefer , if next time this happens we declared a state of emergency , effectively putting the army in charge , or would you rather see us essentially shut down borders for asylum claims from neighboring safe countries ? 
  if could dictate everything at once randomly , here 's what i 'd prefer : * exterior eu borders are controlled by a supranational agency where everyone pays in an equal share ( % / gdp or whatever comes to mind ) * a refugee that wants in needs to be verified , catalogued , fingerprints taken and saved for a certain time-frame . 
  * the refugees are distributed ( based on population sizes of countries ) as best as possible . 
  based on e.g. 
  cultural affiliation or languages spoken ( or by the request of a country ) there can be preferred destinations but by default no one has a * right * to pick a specific country . 
  * a maximum amount of refugees over a certain time frame is declared . 
  somewhere in the 1-3 % of the national population range max . 
  at that point i can hopefully cite art 6 and claim that the stability of countries and the eu  art 18 . 
  * if there are more refugees than this number i 'm * still * for diverting more resources to help them live somewhat decently at/around the border but the goal for each and every one of them should be being distributed outside of the eu . 
  max capacity means max capacity . 
  * after a refugee has spent x amount of time in the eu for whatever reason he can ( if he turned out to adjust well , based on the countries own assessment but regulated via eu courts ) work towards becoming an actual migrant , or be forced to return home once the situation there is better . 
  if it is n't there needs to be a long-term solution that ideally involves integrating him into the specific country . 
  * something * like that . 
  but yes , given the two choices you presented i 'd rather see closed borders . 
  i 'd * also * still bitch that i think this should never be a choice in the first place but i can accept the decision that followed . 
  _______  while they are civilians , that does n't mean they should just be allowed to cross any border they want to . 
  fully agreed . 
   we 're simply responding and looking after ourselves , as eu offers no solution . 
  i 'm super torn here because overall for politics i miss the differentiation needed . 
  yes , i fully understand your response . 
  yes , you should be able to understand the response that such a practice is getting denounced . 
  what then happens however is `` they 're denouncing what we 're doing eu no help eu bad omg fuck these guys '' . 
  instead what should happen is `` look , we had no other choice from our perspective but we 're happy to work for a better solution that works for the entire eu . '', 
   i do n't want my country to collaborate with someone like schaeuble on global matters , because his views on every topic of domestic importance have been ghastly . 
  if it 's any consolation i do n't want my country to be represented by him either in global matters , because his views on ( almost ? ), 
  every topic of domestic importance have been ghastly . 
   german sweet talk :p it 's a culture that [ starts very early ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12116/12116-h/12116-h.htm ) when we 're still kids . 
  i think it puts voters in a really dumb position . 
  if i 'm pro-schulz ( but anti-left ) i win only under super specific conditions . 
  spd needs to have more seats than cdu/csu for a big coalition ** or ** enough to form a coalition with just the greens but if they can only gain a majority by picking greens + left i 'm screwed again . 
  slightly awkward . 
  if i have ( any kind of ) police or military force and they enforce the law as it exists i ca n't say `` they 're in favor of these laws because otherwise you 'd see obstructionism '' . 
  you 're effectively proposing to * block * any eu solution for a problem that affects all of the members if just one member is a weak link . 
  ... how the hell is that supposed to end up except in more chaos ? 
   i can only comment where i live , i do n't know much about german media , but excluding obvious right wing outlets , the rest has a heavy liberal bias , including our national media . 
  over here it 's a bit difficult . 
  i usually try to get multiple sources and prefer the neutrally framed ones but seeing how on e.g. 
  / r/de ( which has a massive left bias compared to the general population , same for probably the average german poster here ) regularly major newspapers get called out for right-wing positions it * feels * somewhat balanced . 
   when the government proposed a new migration law ( a provision that avoids declaring a state of emergency but allows us to close down borders ) , the only thing media focused on was , that it could be unconstitutional and kept citing a member of an ngo ( same ngo has a member in the national media content council ) . 
  where are you actually from ? 
  without any further background , from my perspective `` closing borders '' does sound pretty unconstitutional for germany and the media all across the spectrum would react similarly . 
  - and i ca n't blame them , that 's part of their job . 
  it 's up to policy makers to find an alternative that does n't violate basic laws from my perspective ( or address these basic laws , but that 's the same topic we just had =p ) . 
  ______  did n't stop the bbc moaning about them having assault rifles , which is just part of their standard gear and they were accompanied by police . 
  different mentalities . 
  if you just tell me `` our military was assisting the police with border control while carrying assault rifles '' i 'd go `` what the fuck is going on there '' - once you add `` we simply do n't have enough police officers '' that turns into an `` oh . 
  welp , good call but we ( the eu ) should find a way to address that . '', 
  if only the first part is said through an entire report ... yeah , agreed , it 's probably aiming for more outrage than actual information . 
  only way to prevent that is checking other sources as well . 
  kind of a shame that the bbc did that tho . 
   i do think having someone like wagenknecht in government would be a disaster though . 
  oh god . 
  please no . 
  \\* shudder \\*, 
   we managed to solve it on our own this time , but the help of our friends is still welcome . 
  that 's what i mean though . 
  i do n't want germany to swap direction in 4 years and then we 're still kind of friends but then suddenly not if your borders have an issue . 
  to me the eu is at least partially supposed to protect us from small swings , one of its primary goals was always stability on the continent . 
  it should be more than national election cycles and a tool for populism that gets brought up when something needs to be blamed . 
   if public opinion changed , could we leave the union without restrictions ? 
  looking at the way politicians speak about the situation with the uk , i do n't think so . 
  personally i do hope so . 
  what annoys me about the uk specifically as a regular citizen was the mix of [ these types ] ( https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/clseievvyaii9yl.jpg ) of advertisements that were withdrawn days after the vote passed and the uk seemingly trying to gain much better conditions that are n't given to anyone else . 
  i 'm fine with some concessions here and there but in the overall picture the uk * should * have less of an advantage of the eu existing when they decide to leave the union . 
  analogue for everyone else . 
  what makes this all so awkward to me is , and i mean this as neutral as it 's possible to say it , that i sometimes feel like the divide in the eu overall is too large for certain things . 
  for example the [ polish opt-out ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom ) on gay couples is something that , to me , should have never happened in the first place . 
  analogue , there should be more pressure on e.g. 
  germany to * actually * legalize gay marriage but there is n't any because we 're always forced to look at the kind of example of poland first . 
  i 'm not sure if the eu itself is a victim of a sunk-cost fallacy in some regards and was too ambitious too quickly in some others . 
  i do however feel that , in retrospect , it grew too large too fast even though i do n't think this was obvious before values actually got tested by outside forces . 
   pretty sure that the visegrad pushed for a stronger frontex back in late 2015 when merkel was ranting incoherently about `` this is not my europe '' when people talked about the fact that her refusal to put a cap on who could come was , in fact , lunacy . 
  you mean [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35093827 ) type of proposal that was in the end blocked by e.g. 
  poland ? 
  ______  i do notice that the refusal to accept part of the blame for germany 's very loose asylum policies is intact , which is in keeping with the general feeling in germany that germany never does any mistakes , ever , and merkel is always responsible and anyone saying otherwise is probably on putin 's payrolls - because that 's what the german media tells us . 
  which refusal to accept part of blame ? 
  if i say `` germany 's very liberal asylum policies should be just as irrelevant as poland trying to ignore asylum seekers . '', 
  that directly implies partial responsibility . 
  once again : there should be no `` german policy '' and no `` polish policy '' , there should be an `` eu policy '' . 
  it 's one thing to ignore that part , it 's another to repeatedly pretend it does n't exist . 
  ________  she was forced into her recent hardening on immigration , she did n't go there out of convinction .
