  disabled veterans were also exempted ** . 
  to avoid the necessity of a slow trial in open court , which was required for those belonging to the most serious categories , ** more than 90 % of cases were judged not to belong to the serious categories ** and therefore were dealt with more quickly . 
  conclusions :  as denazification was deemed ineffective and counterproductive by the americans , they did not oppose the plans of the west german chancellor , konrad adenauer , to end the denazification efforts . 
  adenauer 's intention was to switch government policy to reparations and compensation for the victims of nazi rule ( wiedergutmachung ) , stating that the main culprits had been persecuted . 
  in 1951 several laws were passed , ending the denazification . 
  ** officials were allowed to retake jobs in the civil service , with the exception of people assigned to group i ( major offenders ) and ii ( offenders ) during the denazification review process . 
  **  several amnesty laws were also passed which affected about 792,176 people . 
  those pardoned included people with six-month sentences , 35,000 people with sentences of up to one year and include more than 3,000 functionaries of the sa , the ss , and the nazi party who participated in dragging victims to jails and camps ; 20,000 other nazis sentenced for `` deeds against life '' ( presumably murder ) ; 30,000 sentenced for causing bodily injury , and 5,200 who committed `` crimes and misdemeanors in office . '', 
  as a result , several people with a former nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of western germany . 
  ... what the fuck . 
  i keep getting more and more confused the further i read down this chain . 
  we know he was bullied since at least 2010 in school ( he was on the record as a victim in 2010 and 2012 ) , he was obsessed with other school shootings , admired breivik & the german right-wing afd party . 
  he changed his name from `` ali '' to `` david '' when he turned 18 , was proud of sharing the same birthday with hitler & considered himself `` aryan '' . 
  he was in treatment for a social phobia and anxiety attacks since 2015 . 
  during the attack he was under the influence of a prescribed anti-depressant . 
  later it was found out that the people he targeted ( in age and demographics ) were similar to the people he felt bullied by . 
  all of them had a migration background , seven of them were muslim . 
  basically while yes , he did target foreigners and associated himself with right-wing extremists it 's difficult to reduce that case entirely to such a motive . 
  it 's overall a scenario that was brewing since years and planned since at least one year before the actual shooting spree with a lot of factors coming together . 
  honestly , considering the [ actual impact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-ba'athification#impact ) of the aftermath in iraq it 's a surprise that only a few thousand of 500k + unemployed soldiers ended up joining the likes of the so-called is . 
  this entire thing was botched in unbelievable ways . 
  you ca n't just exclude an entire group of people from the democratic process and then proclaim you gave the people democracy . 
  hell , you could n't even ** go to a university without party membership ** . 
   all the harmful outlets for mentally ill , or just very confused and maladjusted , teenagers ( and adults for that matter ) are so accessible . 
  i do n't even think most people are aware * how * easy these things are . 
  dad browses reddit , clicks a few interesting links . 
  kids get a right-wing facebook ad because of dads browsing behavior . 
  kid clicks on it . 
  congratulations , they 're now getting more of this kind of crap and no one will be able to tell what started this . 
   that iranian dude did n't claim any connection to islam or daesh , though . 
  he fit the classic school shooter stereotype , just that he chose a mcdonalds to start his spree . 
  friendly reminder that [ cnn reported ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/07/22/u-s-official-isis-activity-concerns-across-europe-lead-starr-dnt.cnn ) a muslim terror connection from the very second it happened based on a - still unverified and unnamed - witness that only they were able to find who made claims that * no single other witness * ever confirmed and that never aligned with any other evidence found during the investigation . 
  still tilts me because reddit was filled with these reports by people using them as evidence of some kind of coverup and an islamist connection . 
  * especially * because early on another video became public that showed him very directly talking about him seeing himself as german . 
  transcript :   a very dramatic account from this witness , it 's a woman , we 're only calling her `` lauretta '' right now just for her safety . 
  my producer dougal mcconnell speaks fluent german and he was able to reach this woman by calling different stores in that area of that mall . 
  he reached her when she was hiding in a windowless store right next door to the mcdonalds . 
   now lauretta told us this , that she was in the mcdonalds when a gunman came out of a bathroom and started firing , she said she was only 2cm away from him , she said his back was turned to her or she believes she would be dead right now . 
  she says her eight year old son was in the bathroom with him and saw him loading his gun . 
  bonus quote : `` i hear allahu akbar . 
  this i know because i 'm muslim too . 
  i hear this and only crying . '', 
  i 'd like to think that was payback for adenauer blocking de gaulle 's eu dreams . 
  i honestly was n't even aware that france [ looked rather similar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/may_1968_events_in_france ) in that regard at the time . 
  i think it 's a bit funny though that you guys with your history of socialists and revolutions did n't escalate as much as [ we did ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) . 
  shit was n't fun at all . 
  some of those guys ( or rather the third generation of those guys , now in their 50s ) are still ` active ' btw , three of them tried to rob a bank transport last year by holding it up with a bazooka among other things . 
   i can definitely feel a lot of resentment towards the 68ers * in france lately , especially among the younger generations . 
  what do you mean specifically by resentment ? 
  what kind of things did they do/say/not do that causes it ? 
   the spd has made it clear time and time again that there will not be such a coalition so long as the linke calls nato into question and is generally a safehaven for communist nutbags . 
  did they make such a statement * since schulz became the top candidate * ? 
  i honestly have n't heard that yet , i only know that people * assume * this is still a thing . 
   that 's meanwhile a problem in germany the big partys like cdu and spd are so spread from left to right including the middle that they cover the whole spectrum . 
  nothing left to be unique and grap some votes . 
  it 's only a matter of time until they 're split in the middle by a new party , potentially even centre-left . 
   on top of it , schulz failed to deliver on reversing the `` agenda 2010 '' which the spd introduced under chancellor gerhard schroeder . 
  that was the cardinal sin which most spd voters never did forgive , and without `` undoing '' the agenda 2010 , schulz ' promises of justice and equality seem hollow . 
  that summed it up perfectly for me . 
  the [ entire circle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeheimer_kreis ) around these ideals is still around in the party . 
  at least from my point of view i have a really hard time understanding what economically liberal policies even * do * in a social-democratic party . 
  we can trace their origins pretty much to [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_student_movement ) student protests which is why a '' ' 68er '' ( as in a person involved in the movement of ' 68 ) does n't exactly have the best connotation nowadays . 
  from my point of view those people were responsible for a * lot * of great shit but then they got into power and had no idea what to * really * do with it . 
   ours taste like water if i think `` tomatoes that taste like water '' i * instantly * think of dutch tomatoes specifically as well and i 'm living no where near your border . 
  =p but then they 're also the ones available when nothing else is around so i guess that 's the price we pay for that . 
   and other good stuff [ baklava ] ( http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2010/3/3/1/fnm_040110-michael-symon-easter-002_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.jpeg ) , [ uluda\u011f gazoz ] ( http://www.mozaikgmbh.com/eng/assets/img/content/urunler/uludag/uludag-gazoz/50cl.png ) and [ ayran ] ( https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/wiki/images/thumb/b/b7/ayran.jpg/300px-ayran.jpg ) come to mind . 
  i also recently found out that my local turkish store is pretty much involved in a strawberry mafia type situation where they pay local farmers a premium to get the good stuff a week before most regular stores . 
  turkish store = best produce is pretty much a given around here . 
  also they 're * super * fucking nice . 
  feel free to yell at me if i 'm making an obvious logical mistake anywhere , i 'm mostly armchair-generaling this . 
  we can probably agree on the idea that capitalism encourages ownership of the few which , given enough time , will inherently disenfranchise the many . 
  my argument is pretty much based on similar thoughts as the classic marxist idea of [ capital accumulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_accumulation#marxian_concept ) but i do n't think the solution is to argue for common ownership but for treating wealth exactly the same as income . 
  if we encourage owning raw money , we arrive at a race to the top with no goal in sight . 
  to me this is where most of the negative connotations of capitalism come from : people hoard , people one-up each other for gain * with the sole goal * of obtaining more wealth . 
  if let ownership go unchecked we 'll eventually arrive at a scenario where resources ( including land to live on ) would run out . 
  note that neither infinite ownership of capital nor infinite ownership of ` money ' is something that would be even technically possible if we 'd still exchange goods with actual comprehensible value . 
  we literally built a system to enable this , without exactly being fully aware of all the consequences . 
  if we instead encourage income ( with the intent to spend ) this money keeps fluctuating back to people , it stays in circulation which gives it a more constant shot at re-distribution than if it can sit around and just wait for opportunities to purchase . 
  the classic solution i see people suggest to reduce inequality is to attack income inequality , a great modern case in point is [ m\u00e9lenchon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-luc_m%c3%a9lenchon#political_positions ) arguing for 100 % taxes above a certain income . 
  i 'm calling that an inefficient approach because it discourages labour and stiffles competition . 
  instead i * want * people to earn what the market sees them they 're worth i * want * them to rewarded . 
  but just like we have higher tax for people with more income we need a similar mechanism for wealth in terms of money and wealth in terms of ownership . 
   why would we take non integrating , anti woman-rights , somehow anti-western people who do n't wan na be in poland in the first place and pay for it when we have milions of ukrainians literally next door ? 
  we are poor , not stupid . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that 85 % of the arguments people ( and e.g. 
  people from poland specifically ) use to justify being against e.g. 
  syrian refugees are what i 'm used to people using against poles instead . 
  or italians , or turks . 
  they have a different culture , they steal our jobs , they 're just here for the money or social welfare , they wo n't integrate , they are n't even trying to learn the language , they 're rude to our women . 
  it all turned out to be bullshit . 
  when germans were asked in march 1956 whether they 're for or against bringing italian workers to germany 55 % said `` against '' , 20 % were in favor and 6 % said they were in favor under regulations and under specific circumstances . 
  of the people being against 41 % gave ` there are already enough german workers ' as their reasoning for their stance . 
  it 's that stereotype that slowly but surely went away when people realized these italians are n't that bad . 
  the exact same happened for turks and poles later on . 
  but all of them were ( and sometimes still are ) opposed because `` they 're lazy , take german jobs and just want money '' . 
  turns out the majority of every nation is simply human . 
   yeah , but wealth accumulation is a problem derived by capitalism , is it not ? 
  no , it 's a problem derived by * our implemention * of capitalism . 
  in theory we * could * have systems that redistribute wealth without removing other capitalistic principles . 
  we * could * for example shift income taxes to some kind of capital tax .
