  accumulating wealth is a bit like taking water out of the ecosystem and putting it in a tank . 
  that slowly but surely destroys the ecosystem . 
   which , in a free market regime , is a problem because you can not compete on this with someone who has way more money than you . 
  yup , fully agreed . 
  but that 's the trick : if there is more incentive to spend money instead of hording it to kill competition we * could * see this issue becoming less of a problem . 
   and the capitalist system does n't work . 
  i thought it was clear by now . 
  it makes everyone poorer , except for a minority who gets richer . 
  it must be undone . 
  i think that 's an extremist view and we have no evidence that anything works * better * than capitalistic systems in general . 
  * however * there are lots of things various countries tweak about capitalism . 
  from my point of view the # 1 priority should be to reduce inequality . 
  germany used to be pretty good there before 2005ish , south korea is another capitalist country that 's still doing great in this regard . 
  i do n't even think income inequality is the main problem here past basic minimum incomes that need to be guaranteed by all means . 
  it 's income that does n't get spent and stops moving around aka accumulated wealth . 
  overall i 'd rather people have higher income and lower wealth than the other way around . 
  basically the issue you 're pointing out has to do with * wealth accumulation * and not capitalism in general . 
  i think they 're just all evolving together :  ... maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future `` press briefings '' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy ??? 
  - elected president of a proper american democracy . 
   it 's not just syrians though . 
  at this point somewhere around 15 % of the population are foreign-born ( so that 's not counting the children of immigrants that were born here ) . 
  the question is if that 's necessarily a bad thing . 
  [ here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ausl%c3%a4nder#/media/file:personen_mit_migrationshintergrund_2012.svg ) for example is a map of germany from 2012 with the % of the population with a migration background ( this includes 2nd generation with at least one foreign born parent ) . 
  overall we have ~ 10-12 % of the population with foreign passports and foreign born * should * be quite a bit higher than that . 
  that area in the bottom left with lots of places at 25 % and above ? 
  top # 3 state in germany in terms of gdp after north rhine-westphalia ( another red heavy area on the center left ) and bavaria . 
  what 's important to note about this map is that the former gdr areas have overall less foreigners , more crime , less jobs - they even have less women because they 're moving away quicker than the men ( 2007 , [ 20-24 year old ] ( http://www.daburna.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/deutschlandkarte_sexualproportion_20bis24jaehrige.jpg ) and [ 30-34 year old ] ( http://www.daburna.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/deutschlandkarte_sexualproportion_30bis34jaehrige.jpg ) ) . 
  note that i 'm not trying to argue that more immigrants means better places to live but we * do * have a clear pattern where areas that are perceived as the most xenophobic are overall worse off . 
  it 's also those areas where our far-right parties rose the most during the refugee crisis and * not * in the places that already had the most foreigners . 
  overall it 's incredibly difficult to judge if this is a good or a bad thing over here . 
  what i * can * tell you is that at our local university an easy 80 % of people studying german studies do n't have ` german sounding ' names . 
  =p  there 's actually been some ( but very little ) talk about changing the law so the government can create incentives for immigrants who choose to settle somewhere where there are few immigrants . 
  i * think * we have similar laws and i 'd agree they can be a pretty bad thing . 
  a few eastern european people i know whose parents moved here ~ 30-40 years ago always mentioned that being forced to live with people where the only common language was german helped them loads . 
   however , another factor here is that up until about a generation ago sweden was extremely ethnically homogeneous which is also reflected in swedish culture so there are a lot of little everyday culture clashes where immigrants think swedes are rude ( or `` racist '' ) and swedes think these foreigners they graciously took in are the ones being rude and disrespectful when not following the unwritten rules of swedish society . 
  what kind of examples do you have in mind here ? 
  what i 'm usually noticing in [ swedish statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_sweden#country_of_origin_for_persons_born_abroad ) is n't that the total number is high , but that the various groups are extremely close to each other in numbers . 
  here in comparison we pretty much have turks and poles as top two groups size wise with average ages of 43 and 37 respectively . 
  romanians are at 32 and now syrians at 26 officially . 
  basically we have big chunks of people that have been here since decades who are now incredibly useful in society and who can help integrate those who are here since a shorter timespan . 
  what was immigration in sweden like 20-50 years ago ? 
  that 's pretty much when germany broke with the homogeneous idea with turkish , polish and italian workers moving here . 
  did you guys not have a phase like that and only recently moved from 0 to 100 ? 
   i 've been calling it ` regionalist ' , it 's kind of vague but it 's the best i could come up with . 
  i realized i 'm not the smartest cat since especially german actually has a word for this : [ lokalpatriotismus ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/lokalpatriotismus ) , literally `` local patriotism '' ( duh ) . 
  apparently `` patriotyzm lokalny '' in polish and `` lok\u00e1lpatriotizmus '' in slovakian are a thing too . 
  iirc it stems from `` lokaljournalismus '' ( local journalism ) which apparently is called `` community journalism '' in english . 
  local patriotism/community patriotism , national patriotism , continental/european patriotism . 
  solved !, 
  by extension we can just call the person exhibiting it a lokalist , nationalist or continentalist but that also would include all the exclusive negative connotations . 
  `` european '' fits the bill rather well , too . 
  either way it 's not a clear opposite to nationalism , more like a structure on top of it . 
   this is what a lot of people are worried about , the volumes of people involved are simply too large . 
  are n't we talking about like 1.5 % of the population for sweden as `` syrians '' ? 
  if i take a group of 100 of hundred americans and add two dudes from india it 's still a group of americans in my book . 
  =p  on top of this at least here in sweden for a long time `` multiculturalism '' has meant `` if their culture is different we should just let them self-segregate and make crazy demands because anything else would make us literally worse than hitler , you do n't want to be worse than hitler , right ? '', 
  self-segregation or segregation in general is * usually * not the best idea in general . 
  i obviously ca n't speak for sweden but over here at least in some ` self-segregated areas ' you ca n't put the blame entirely on just one side of people . 
   however i fear multiculturalism . 
  your , my and everybody else 's culture that we love and cherish is a result of thousands of years of cultures clashing , melting and re-emerging as new entities . 
  ` diluting ' cultures is a great thing - you and me are doing it right now just by engaging on this site . 
  it allows us to start cherry-picking the best of multiple worlds , allows us to profit from each other . 
  a ` pure culture ' will become just as sick as a ` pure bloodline ' - which we usually refer to as ` inbreeding ' . 
  as long as it 's a slow and controlled process over multiple generations there is nothing to be afraid of except fear itself . 
  ah , yeah , i see where you 're coming from now . 
  ` made up of their own people ' in the sense that they spoke the same language , sure . 
  but then there were conflicts between ruling classes , between different religions , these kinds of things . 
  the question whether both protestants and catholics can belong to the same nation did n't exactly have a clear answer for a long time for example . 
  so while yes , while from todays perspective i agree that it can be a weird example because after all we 're talking about german and french * people * here ( at least mostly , remember the historical solution was a german empire [ without austria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lesser_germany ) despite them speaking the same language ) in historical context it carries the same idea : including people with differences under one concept of a nation because of their similarities . 
  as for the hre [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/holy_roman_empire_1648.svg ) is bordergore from 1648 and [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/map_of_the_holy_roman_empire%2c_1789_en.png ) from 1789 . 
  that 's a lot of stuff included that 's not ` german ' in the sense of the ( 2nd ) german empire from 1871 onwards . 
   you mean ` include homogeneous ' ( same ) or ` exclude heterogeneous ' ( different ) right ? 
  because the examples you gave - germany and france - are both of peoples rather than just people . 
  no , i did mean `` include heterogeneous '' individuals . 
  think of it like this , inclusive nationalism means that people are included in the greater concept of the nation despite fundamental differences . 
  remember [ this clusterfuck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany#/media/file:map_of_the_holy_roman_empire,_1789_en.png ) . 
  people * did * have differences but ( simplified ) they decided that their similarities are more important which is why they could come together in a nation that includes all of them because of their similarities . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_of_germany#/media/file:deutsches_reich_1871-1918.png ) already looks a lot better . 
  analogue the us * did * start out with a massive focus on inclusive nationalism where the idea was to bring all these different people together under one united banner . 
  even today the us is one of the most inclusive nations in the world but they 're shifting to become more exclusive since a decade or two . 
  inclusive/exclusive nationalism are just two different angles from which to define the concept of a nation . 
  one by uniting under things in common over differences and the other by excluding people with certain markers . 
  does this make a bit more sense now ? 
  & nbsp ;  it 's anti-nationalist only in the sense that the eu a supranational organization , so it acts as a bridge across all the nationalisms that are focused on its constituent members . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  i just really dislike calling it ` anti-nationalist ' because of all the other connotations associated with it . 
  it 's much more about letting the individual participants grow stronger ( and can hence be called ` pro-nationalist ' even ) than trying to kill individual identities . 
  i can * both * be patriotic about my nation * and * the eu . 
  presenting these as somehow exclusive to each other is massively counterproductive in my opinion . 
   it 's for people who find it more useful to identify with europe first and with their national citizenship second . 
    people like the idea because it puts focus on kinship and similarities rather than putting emphasis on differences . 
  i mean ... yes , * technically * it 's not nationalism because the eu is not a nation but in practice it 's exactly the same mechanism as other versions of inclusive nationalism . 
  * inclusive * nationalism means that the goal is to include heterogeneous groups of individuals under a common banner . 
  think of the german states uniting * because * of their common culture and language or the french uniting under `` libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 '' . 
  these are concepts that in the vast majority of cases have positive connotations and are what people * usually * refer to as patriotism . 
  ________ `` putting emphasis on differences '' is what you can refer to as * exclusive nationalism * . 
  here the goal is to define membership of the group by * excluding * people who do n't exhibit certain markers that the group overall ( or a part of the group ) does n't want as a part of entire thing . 
  this includes things with a positive connotation that most people do n't think about ( `` you ca n't become a citizen of this nation if you do n't speak the language '' ) but under this umbrella is where most of the negative things we associate with nationalism come from : `` you 're brown/white/black / jewish/muslim/gay , you do n't belong to our nation . '', 
  i think language screws us over a bit here because on a practical level uniting with others from your city over a sports team , uniting with others of your nation over your language or constitution and uniting with people from other nations over shared values are all exactly the same basic concept . 
  we 're just used to this only being relevant in the context of a `` nation '' and not the other versions .
