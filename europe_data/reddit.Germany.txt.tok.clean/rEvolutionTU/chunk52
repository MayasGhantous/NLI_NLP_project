  some further reading with more examples can be found [ here ] ( http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~wmills/course203/7nationalism.html ) for example . 
  ________ tl ; dr : calling being pro-eu `` anti-nationalist '' straight up is about as smart as calling a `` pro-nationalist '' someone who is against local authority or identity . 
  these concepts are intertwined to the core . 
  ___ edit : now that i think about this there really is n't a word for this . 
  ** what do you call someone who is patriotic about his own local culture , dialect or values ? 
  ** does any language even have a concept like that ? 
  one could split it into localist ( lol ) , nationalist , federalist and globalist but that also sounds awkward as hell and connotations do n't line up at all . 
  basically we 're looking for a description that focuses on the inclusive aspect of groups or individuals that interact with each other . 
  one that can apply on a local , national or any other level . 
  `` inclusivist '' sounds also dumb . 
  honestly , in retrospect , i 'd have said the same about germany . 
  this * only * worked in this form because it was pretty much the [ right-wing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeheimer_kreis ) of our main centre-left party that pushed it through . 
  so the ( economically * more * liberal ) opposition went like : `` uh ... 
  sure ? '', 
  and that was the end of it . 
  ... did i mention that the responsible chancellor [ was and is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream_ag ) really tight with russia ? 
  the [ controversies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerhard_schr%c3%b6der#criticism_and_controversies ) page lists more of this kind of crap . 
  basically most of the drama of the last ten years with regards to russian pipelines can also be attributed to that guy . 
  basically while everyone sees russian interference nowadays germany learned about the extent to which this can go under putin more than ten years ago . 
  and when schr\u00f6der was * finally * voted out of office he started attacking media left right and center . 
  and yes , there is quite some salt stemming from that time . 
  :3  however , i think that spain 's problems are even deeper ; the years before agenda 2010 your unemployment was in between 9 and 11 % ; our average of the last 40 years is 16 % . 
  i 'm actually extremely clueless about spain in this regard . 
  did reforms after franco fail ? 
  what * are * the explanations for it being so high ? 
    if they try to justify crimean annexation we simply talk to them about it  so i am doing that , and this is why for the last time : you did n't here , that was not what this topic was about . 
   most of my russia related posts * most * of your posts in here are russia related though , that was kinda the point . 
  =p  so how should i talk to them to have some kind of result ? 
  when someone says that `` estonia is a de facto fascist puppet regime '' then you do what the dutch or germans do when an akp supporter calls us nazis . 
  we call out the original comment and let the downvote train commence . 
  maybe a report on top if he 's really out of line like that . 
  there 's no fight to be won with extremists who are taking such a clear position . 
  * however * there is a massive difference between that kind of guy and what has been happening in this chain . 
  there was a longer review regarding russian disinformation about him [ here ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/the-all-powerful-mr-soros/ ) . 
  overall yeah , they do seem to like the guy . 
   i would estimate that probably 50 % of users with a russian flair on / r/europe are either shilling for le pen , supporting all this russian imperialistic thing about annexation , or both . 
  just few days ago there was a thread on / r/europe where a bunch of users with a russian flair described how ussr rightfully annexed baltics , partitioned poland , sent everyone to gulag , etc , and yes , their favorite - `` eu is a us puppet '' . 
  this happens on / r/europe . 
  on / r/russia they could compete with t_d on the matter of who licks the putin 's ass more . 
  i fully agree . 
  however in this scenario this specific user did n't do this . 
  we need to differentiate the obvious trolls from people who just happen to be born in russia . 
  _____  majority of russian population really supports putin . 
  well , even some of the russians who live in estonia support him - this is beyond of my understanding , nobody is forcing them to do it here . 
  propaganda is an * extremely * powerful tool . 
  germans under hitler did n't support him because germans inherently want to be ruled by a fascist antisemite . 
  they supported him because an extremely efficient propaganda machine combined with systematic oppression of any opposition made his leadership the only reasonable seeming choice . 
   but what would you suggest instead as a plan to fix russia ? 
  keep up the economical pressure . 
  even if russia does n't openly admit it as if now the sanctions * hurt * and without the supports of the oligarchs even the fsb wo n't be loyal to putin . 
  like in any authoritarian regime we need to assume that the common people do n't have any interest in changing anything because that 's just how russians are but because this seems like the only reasonable choice due to the information they have . 
  apart from that , and this is the only reason why i 'm even still bothering despite most of your post history being full of russia this and russia that , the best we can do is include the ones who are ** not ** under the direct influence of this propaganda machine in political and educational discourse . 
  ** even if ** they try to justify things like the crimean annexation it 's much more crucial that we simply talk to them about it than that we make them feel worth less just because they 're russian . 
  because that 's what the likes of putin have been telling them the west will do and there will be nothing they can do about it . 
  this view of the hypocritical west is part of the propaganda here . 
  i do n't have much more to add than this , maybe try asking your parents or grandparents why no one tried overthrowing the regime in estonia until shortly before the fall of the ussr . 
  the answer most likely will be that it simply was n't possible . 
  if ** all ** people would rise up at the same time , sure . 
  but these regimes are * designed * to prevent just that from happening . 
  our [ agenda 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) was responsible pretty much . 
  the gist of it is that social security was cut , unemployment benefits were cut and short-term employments were pushed massively . 
  as a direct result income inequality shot up massively :  another sign that economic inequality has risen in germany can be seen in the fact that the number of germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11 % in 2001 , [ 10 ] to 12.3 % in 2004 , [ 11 ] and about 14 % in 2007 . 
  according to 2007 government statistics , one out of every six children was poor , a post-1960-record , with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  as far as i know we 're at 1/5 nowadays , especially in east germany . 
  in a nutshell , the low unemployment rates came at a * massive * cost and it 's highly questionable if this was the right direction . 
  we basically burned the house down instead of trying to make minor improvements to a slowly failing system and now we 're celebrating that a lot of people are helping to build a house with cheap labor . 
  and yes , this was implemented by a center-left/green coalition . 
  what this did to the german political landscape ( among a few other things like the war in afghanistan ) in general can be seen in [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/german_parliamentary_elections_diagram_de.svg ) graph and you can pretty much cite that as a major reason for why people are still hesitant to vote for that party , even now under schulz . 
   i agree that it is not easy and i said it numerous times , including my previous message , see : and you * started * this whole thing by pointing out an easy list for anyone to follow and questioning why russians do n't do something like this if it 's that easy for you . 
   what could prevent russians to do the same in russia ? 
  what prevented germans from showing so much resistance against the third reich that it collapsed ? 
  what prevented estonians from rising against soviet oppression for so long ? 
  yanukovich as strong as putin ? 
  [ media in ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_the_press_in_ukraine ) vs [ media in russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_freedom_in_russia ) . 
  you 're comparing 3 years of yanukovich till maidan happened with 18 years of putin . 
  it 's like if the us gets rid of trump in 2020 compared to turkey getting rid of erdogan in uh ... 2035 . 
  can you not imagine the difference in damage this causes to a society ? 
  yanukovich came to power in 2010 , before which ukraine was at least a top 90 country on the [ press freedom index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index#rankings_and_scores_by_country ) , the same range greece is in nowadays . 
  russia was in the ~ 150 range since 2003 with company like belarus , turkey , iraq or pakistan . 
  putin has effective control of the kgb/fsb since 18 years at this point . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/how-russia-independent-media-was-dismantled-piece-by-piece ) is how russia handles freedom of information . 
  hint : it 's non-existant via regular sources . 
   in `` you ca n't win if you 're russian invaders and pillagers '' word you was intended to mean the whole russian society as general , not an individual person . 
  sorry if it caused misunderstanding . 
  `` russian '' refers to an individual as a group here . 
  the post points out that russian people ca n't win in this scenario even when they 're genuinely expressing kindness and respect . 
  it does ** not ** mean russian society in general since it 's about how one group ( / r/europe users as a whole ) treats another group of people ( russian citizens who post on / r/europe ) . 
  ___________ e : [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia#list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia ) is a list of journalists killed in russia . 
  now compare that to [ ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_the_press_in_ukraine#timeline_of_reporters_killed_in_ukraine ) and you might see a pattern . 
   sorry but it is not true . 
  people in estonia always hated ussr . 
  we had some resistance movements , most obvious one is metsavennad that tried to liberate estonia from ussr after it reconquered it after 1945 . 
  and i am not saying that it was easy and or what i am suggesting to do today is easy . 
  it is hard . 
  that 's the whole point of what people here are trying to tell you . 
  it took estonia 45 years to pry away from the ussr , just like it took that long for german reunification . 
  and all that was only possible because the ussr as a whole became weak and could n't enforce things anymore . 
  and then you 're telling a 17 year old russian to get rid of the russian government ** as if ** it was something easy they could personally change right now if they just wanted to do so . 
   also , i fail to understand what sense does it make to protest against russian government while if you support annexation of crimea at the same time . 
  i do , even if i completely disagree with it .
