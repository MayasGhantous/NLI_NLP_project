  to me it 's akin to someone supporting the annexation of the sudetenland while condemning the hitler regime in general . 
  not a common point of view i 'd say but somewhat understandable on an emotional level nevertheless . 
  but again : the issue at hand are n't other statements , it 's you trying to tell someone else how easy it is to overthrow a government because the baltics and others did it in 1990 . 
   and i never blamed any russian individually here , except obvious cases when they defend russian regime atrocities . 
  hell , yes you did . 
  [ look at the chain we 're posting in ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6aizcf/eu_grants_ukraine_visafree_travel/dhfa4u9/ ) . 
  this started with an individual with a russian flag next to their name pointing out the issue that they 're seen as hostile even when they try to show sympathy . 
  then ** you ** tried to tell make that individual responsible for russia 's crimes . 
  tell me , which atrocities did / u/haroshinka defend there ? 
   in my opinion , putin 's regime can not be reformed - it just needs to be dissolved and a new government ( probably with a new constitution to prevent a next putin ) should be created from scratch . 
  first of all , it was always about individual resistance in this context . 
  but alright , why did n't estonia do just that before 1987 if these things are that easy ? 
   i did not mean that they are either physically or intellectually incapable , i meant that majority of russian population in my opinion is completely okay with everything that happens in russia and because of that there is no effort to fix anything . 
  yes and the majority of estonians were completely okay with everything that happened before 1987 . 
  and the germans in nazi germany were completely okay with the holocaust . 
  and the people living in north korea are completely okay with their current regime . 
  - because of these people simply being okay with that there is no effort to fix anything . 
  * we 're talking about what are effectively dictatorships that have complete control over the media and the narrative that people get . 
  *  i always try to do that . 
  the person that i replied to - haroshinka , is justifying annexation of crimea in this thread . 
  it seems to be on the other side than i am . 
  great , and if i was active in that thread i 'd call her out on it . 
  right now it 's about you trying to blame an individual citizen for the russian regime existing . 
  on * top * of that we 're talking about someone who is too young to vote and someone who already said they 're taking part in protests when they 're in russia . 
  you 're judging them for being * russian * and you 're trying to make them responsible for the russian government and leadership . 
  that 's completely out of line . 
  * dude . 
  * you 're talking to a random civilian . 
  the `` what do you propose * we * do ? '', 
  was said in context of resistance within russia against the regime and your suggestion is to return crimea to ukraine ? 
  the ussr ** did ** win the war against nazi germany . 
  millions died and suffered for that cause . 
  the average soldier in that war was just as much of a miserable prick with as much choice as any other soldier in any other war . 
  you 're mixing that together with glorifying stalin and the ussr as a whole . 
  admittedly , some people do that but these things * are * different things . 
  and the rest of your points go back to the first one . 
  i understand that you ( and me , and most likely other russians in this thread ) have issues with the russian regime and its history . 
  that 's a good thing , keep it up . 
  but you ca n't keep confusing that with * individual citizens * . 
   you see i wrote this message in few minutes , why ca n't russians come up with and implement some decent plan at least like the one that i described ? 
  i have a really hard time even thinking of an explanation for how condescending this is . 
  why did n't germans in nazi germany come up with some decent plan like giving back the sudetenland ? 
  there was no point to even try to justify this act of annexation . 
  why did n't estonians dissolute their government before 1987 and elect a new one if they * really * did n't like it ? 
  these kind of questions are all complete and utter bullshit and you 're engaging in the same kind of rhetoric . 
  individuals are not responsible for what some collective entity they belong to by birth does or has done in the past . 
  please , * please * try judging them by their actions and their individual character . 
  odds are the person you 're talking to is actually on the exact same side as you ( or me ) , just with a different passport . 
  what exactly is your answer trying to imply and how did it answer the ( pretty damn valid ) points the user you 're replying to brought up ? 
  i can identify with that rant . 
  what i miss is a party that stands for social democratic ideals like free education , strong healthcare , re-training and re-education for those without jobs and an overall positive climate for people to take risks in . 
  to me education , social safeguards and technological progress are * the * backbone around which the future should be built . 
  add a few sprinkles of personal liberties like a reasonable stance on data protection & privacy issues and top it all off with a refugee/immigration/integration policy that does n't sound like either adolf or the classic ' 68-hippy would be proud of . 
  basically from my view the spd is ruined by their [ right-wing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeheimer_kreis ) while * die linke * is ruined by their left wing . 
  meanwhile cdu , while reasonable under merkel , is overall dragged down by the csu and the ` christian ' tag is really something we should consider getting rid off in general . 
  greens are lost in an identity crisis since their primary reasons to exist became mainstream and the fdp became a corporate-owned shell of their initially noble libertarian ideals . 
  it will probably be up to our generation to clean that shit up from the middle but then it also does n't seem exactly easy to start parties from scratch with a clear vision from start to finish . 
  the pirateparty for example completely imploded under inner divides with no clear leadership . 
  but tbh with everyone struggling we 're in a reasonable time period to consider those kinds of options . 
   but you can definitely see that the problem * grew * after that . 
  obligatory link to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) thread , the tl ; dr is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ftggcy.png ) graph . 
  no , it did n't . 
  e : this also clearly contradicts your statement further below :  in september 2015 , the group of people located in the balkans was not in the millions . 
  it was about 60 thousand people from greece to hungary , afaik . 
  the most massive wave got underway from turkey only after that . 
   they wanted to close the borders but nobody wanted to take the popularity hit . 
  i think the last sentence of that article is quite a bit misleading considering the paragraphs before that . 
  according to this article merkel wanted : * a ) confirmation from ministers that such an order would stand in front of german courts ( hint : it most likely would n't ) . 
  * b ) confirmation from ministers that it would not come to the german military ( ! ), 
  doing things against the refugees that would go against public sentiment . 
  note that this is very clearly * not * something the german military is allowed to interfere with unless we 're talking about an absolute case of emergency . 
  considering that a ) was highly improbable and b ) a reasonable concern because such a thing happening * would * most likely go against a clear majority opinion in the population i can understand not sticking to the initial strict plan in this situation . 
   i think more people would be okay with it if so many were n't obviously opportunists . 
  there is practically no way that germany is the first ` safe ' country they found . 
  just to add onto here since the other reply covered most of the other points if you 're referring to the initial circumvention of dublin by germany that was more of a `` the situation is more than bad , the eu does n't step in , * someone * has to take these people '' to my understanding . 
   problem is , there is not a party left to vote for for a social-democrat like myself . 
  i had this discussion with people before but the issue can be seen in one graph : [ schr\u00f6der ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/german_parliamentary_elections_diagram_de.svg ) . 
  that cabinet * can * also be seen as one of the main reasons for the [ rising inequality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010#consequences ) :  another sign that economic inequality has risen in germany can be seen in the fact that the number of germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11 % in 2001 , [ 10 ] to 12.3 % in 2004 , and about 14 % in 2007 . 
  according to 2007 government statistics , one out of every six children was poor , a post-1960-record , with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  _______ turns out that if parties come into power after 20 years of campaigning on certain policies voters * really * do n't appreciate it if they turn all that upside down . 
  i 'm personally hoping that under schulz they get back into shape until 2021 but until then i do n't see myself supporting them in the near future unless they * really * take strong and independent stances quickly . 
  after all it was only last election that people like gabriel promised to not go for a big coalition and we know how that went . 
  do n't mock the ausstieg of the ausstieg of the ausstieg of nuclear energy pls . 
  a lot of russian activity in germany seems to manifest itself through actions like in [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminal_case_of_lisa_f . ), 
  type of case where russian immigrants stirred up a story that was pretty much manufactured and/or massively played up by russian media . 
  another big worry should be that we have chechnyan immigrants here who are loyal to kadirov and there are reports of them actively spying and infiltrating mosques , i made a longer comment about this topic [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67ethp/russia_is_believed_to_be_the_source_of_an_influx/dgq2ly5/ ) not too long ago . 
  this is just the tip of the iceberg , most of it does n't ever make it into western media but is simply [ spread by russian state media ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/alternative-germany/ ) . 
  well ... the german npd used the [ same imagery ] ( https://boesmenschennews.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/npd-svp-poster2.jpg ) and the [ svp ] ( https://boesmenschennews.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/negerplakat.jpg ) seems to have a history here . 
  the actual nazis were a bit more [ direct ] ( https://boesmenschennews.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jewishratmsn.jpg ) here but i do n't think the svp poster above aims to * not * invoke this kind of connotation either . 
  i do see a certain thematic similarity here . 
   there is nothing stopping an eu/european entity from doing the same thing . 
  if you think the reason there 's no eu based search engine is because of patent laws , then you are incorrect . 
  i think south korea could be a good example to look at here , a country of ~ 50 million inhabitants that basically has most online infrastructure covered for their citizens . 
  things like [ caf\u00e9 daum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daum_ ( web_portal \\ ) ) ( ~ facebook ) , [ naver band ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/band_ ( software \\ ) ) ( ~ organisational social media ) or [ kakao talk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kakaotalk ) ( messenger/whatsapp ) are all specifically south korean things and not related to e.g. 
  japan or china . 
  e : regarding `` there is no eu based search engine '' - the french already got something pretty damn strong together : https://www.qwant.com, 
  question | answer -- | -- where are you from ? 
  | germany what languages can you speak fluently ? 
  | german and english . 
  there is also some rusty french that is usually enough to understand shitposts and memes .
