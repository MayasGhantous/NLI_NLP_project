  what is your usual timezone ? 
  | varies quite a bit , usually between cet/est/pst . 
  i 'm self-employed and my schedule changes frequently . 
  i also sometimes have lots of spare time for a while and then none at all for a few weeks . 
  have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit ? 
  | not on reddit but i 'm used to administrating various gaming-related groups and organizing rl events ( concerts and similar events mostly ) . 
  what do you like the most about / r/europe ? 
  | it 's a great mix from casual and fun content all the way to serious and in-depth explanations . 
  i 'm learning a lot about other groups and interests i otherwise would n't get as much information about as easily . 
  it 's the sub i enjoy spending the most time in on reddit nowadays and i love the feeling that it allows me to both feel like i 'm contributing to something that is greater than myself while also profiting from the contributions of others . 
  do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone ? 
  | co-operation  isolation , that 's the point of the eu , is n't it ? 
  i believe in strong guidelines that are set as a team and individuals standing up for the consensus over personal agendas and interests . 
  in general , how would you evaluate / r/europe 's rules ? 
  | well enough defined and seemingly applied reasonably . 
  as a nitpick i do n't like that they are multiple lists of 1-x though . 
  they should be 1.1 , 2.1 etc. 
  so that it 's clear what rule is referred to specifically . 
  case in point : this thread . 
  =p what change would you make in / r/europe if you could ? 
  | i think more amas from all kinds of directions relevant to europe in general could be a cool thing to have and i 'd gladly help organizing them . 
  maybe not necessarily * on * / r/europe but certainly advertised by the sub when they have a relevant context . 
  why do you want to join / r/europe 's mod team ? 
  | i highly enjoy posting in here and i 'd like to contribute so that this space can overall stay constructive and positive . 
  do you think politically neutral moderation is achievable and/or desirable ? 
  | achievable in an absolute sense ? 
  no , that 's not realistic . 
  individuals have biases , `` political opinions '' can range from simple statements all the way to complete extremes that attack the foundation of the societies we love itself . 
  desirable ? 
  also no . 
  moderation in my opinion should set well-defined and transparent guidelines wherever it is possible within which a civil discourse can take place . 
  the point is to * moderate * in every sense of the word . 
   if you dislike that the spd is doing right-wing stuff it is about spd/greens doing things ** against the way they present themselves ** . 
  you ca n't campaign on being `` left '' , then implement classic centre-right policies and * then * still expect voters to trust you because you believe they wo n't settle for a 2nd best option anyway . 
  they will , and that 's why they dropped from 40 % to 23 % . 
   often i do n't understand it either but that 's just what they want i assume . 
  in one graph : [ schr\u00f6der ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/german_parliamentary_elections_diagram_de.svg ) . 
  that cabinet effectively stopped many , many voters from trusting the center-left spd . 
  we 're talking about losing 15 % + of votes here and their lowest results since 1945 . 
  the basic gist was that the [ right-wing of the spd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeheimer_kreis ) came into power , pushed through things that could have come from the left/center wing of the cdu and did all of this under a ` left ' flag . 
  at that point you might as well vote for a cdu under merkel anyway . 
  it 's only now with schulz ( who is a known centrist withing the spd ) that there 's a slow recovery starting to happen . 
  and in that case they 're currently blocking voters out who 'd gladly go for spd/green but have zero interest in * die linke * gaining any power . 
   since 2002 , `` feta '' has been a protected designation of origin product in the european union . 
  according to the relevant eu legislation , only those cheeses produced in a traditional way in particular areas of greece , which are made from sheep 's milk , or from a mixture of sheep 's and up to 30 % of goat 's milk from the same area , can be called `` feta '' . 
  eu , helping us against fake cheese since 2002 . 
  again , it 's ** either ** maturity ** or ** youth typical crime . 
  both allow the courts to use juvenile law instead . 
   the perpetrators ( all aged 19-21 ) were mostly convicted under juvenile law though the wiki article disagrees but is n't precise either , we 'd have to look into better reports to figure that out :  alle sechs t\u00e4ter wurden vom gericht zu haftstrafen ohne bew\u00e4hrung wegen gef\u00e4hrlicher k\u00f6rperverletzung , ** zum teil nach jugendstrafrecht ** , verurteilt . 
  what i was n't aware though is that in this cas the treatment of the media specifically was used to hand out a lower sentence . 
  did n't know that 's a thing . 
   i do n't have any numbers to back it up , but based on my perception - if you 're under 22 years old there 's like a 90 % chance that you 'll get reduced sentencing under juvenile law in germany . 
  juvenile law in general is applicable to people between 18 and 20 years at the time of the crime : [ \u00a7 1 jgg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_jgg/englisch_jgg.html#p0008 ) . 
  it 's specifically * below * 21 . 
  so just based on that your perception is off already . 
  =p people who get convicted via juvenile law above that age usually either committed it at an earlier time and people misunderstand the reporting or there is an exception made for multiple crimes for which sentences are handed out at the same time according to [ \u00a7 32 jgg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_jgg/englisch_jgg.html#p0148 ) . 
   the electoral college system fails at what democracy is meant to do : give power to the people . 
  that 's because the [ original plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #original _ plan ) assumed politics without factions and electors that vote their conscience and not what their ( presumably less educated ) constituents want them to vote . 
  they got rid of that approach pretty quickly though . 
   anyways , i think this referendum will be a no , from what i hear that is . 
  that depends on [ how many times ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=q5ol-vzv5re ) two people enter a voting cabin together and then come out with five ballots that get counted . 
  more videos like that can be found in the [ megathread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/turkey/comments/65pe5y/megathread_2017_constitutional_referandum_results/ ) for the referendum . 
   what country does the referendum applies to ? 
  on which countries territory is the referendum supposed to be held ? 
   the referendum has nothing to do with germany . 
  any foreign referendum on any states territory resembles an exercise of the states right of one state in the territory of another . 
  the default is such a referendum ** not ** being allowed . 
  in this case the german government just like the austrian , belgish or dutch one refuse to give their permissions for such a referendum . 
  the specific and official background this decision is based on can be found in german [ here ] ( https://www.bundestag.de/blob/504712/f75ca943093b62df5561d658633577d5/wd-2-039-17-pdf-data.pdf ) . 
  the gist is that such referendum needs the consent of the receiving state since it 's a specific example of another state trying to exercise their states rights on the territory of the receiving state . 
  basically the german , austrian , dutch , belgish or any other governments ** have ** to approve such a referendum in order to make it possible . 
  what this means in practice is that legally the default state is such a thing not being allowed . 
  since the death penalty is [ specifically outlawed ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0569 ) according to the german constitution the german government decided to exercise their rights here to not allow such a referendum . 
  alright , thanks a lot for explaining this in more detail . 
  pretty awkward how much of this was something i got wrong/would have gotten wrong if i went into it so it 's good to get educated . 
  one more question :  this guy was 21 during the crime , so his punishment depends on a psychatric evaluation that deems if he is matured enough to be seen as an adult or not . 
  if the guy would have been 22 , this rule would n't have been applicable anymore . 
  is this specific to murder or something general ? 
  i 'm asking because [ wiki ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/jugendstrafrecht_ ( deutschland \\ ) #alters - _ und_reifestufen ) specifically mentions 18-20 as the cut-off for `` heranwachsender '' and not 18-21 like you ( which i also would initially assume ) . 
  analog does \u00a7 32 jgg apply in a capital case like this as well ? 
  again wiki specifically lists an example of someone committing a crime at 17 and 22 for example . 
  good question . 
  my personal understanding as a layman is that while murder germany can mean a life sentence ( which * can * mean you 're eligible for parole after 15 years in some cases ) according to [ \u00a7 211 stgb ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1803 ) this is connected with specific `` aggravating '' circumstances . 
  in cases where these do n't apply [ \u00a7 49 stgb ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0260 ) comes into play which means sentences from 3-15 years are the norm . 
  again a different thing is `` totschlag '' ( ~ manslaughter ) which is the killing of someone without a specific motive for murder . 
  there we 're looking at 5-15 years baseline , livelong imprisonment in harsher and 1-10 years in lighter cases . 
  [ [ source ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/totschlag_ ( deutschland \\ ) #unterschied _ zum_mord-tatbestand ) ] i 'm going to go ahead and tag / u/milleditsch / u/mistermysterios though who posted further below that they 're studying german law . 
  in case what i said above was n't accurate i 'm hoping that one of them or someone else can correct me . 
  _________ e : nevermind , mistermysterios already went on an explanatory rampage in this chain that gives more context . 
  i decided to try and find some stats on crimes against homeless in general for germany and it 's far more difficult than i expected , tagging onto this since you are the top comment as of now . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the available data is * incredibly shitty * , the basic gist is that homeless do n't have many groups advocating for their rights . 
  there does not seem to be a clear pattern as for who is committing these attacks . 
  from refugees like here to neonazis to youth `` having fun '' or `` trying to teach those lazy people a lesson '' everything exists . 
  ** in a nutshell , every sub-group that has issues with violence likes to direct some of it at homeless people . 
  ** if anyone finds better sources or more data in general feel free to pm or comment below but it does seem pretty damn hard to do so . 
  all numbers below should be considered a very clear minimum , the expected dark figure of these crimes is most likely higher . 
  ___________ the german far-left pds tried to push for recognizing politically motivated crimes against homeless [ since 2001 ] ( http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/14/068/1406870.pdf ) . 
  just in 2016 the greens [ made another request ] ( http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/rechte-gewalt-toetung-von-obdachlosen-luecken-in-der-statistik/19469738.html ) in this direction and were outraged that homeless are not a specific category that is officially talked about . 
  all they could get were attacks against groups under the category of `` social status '' which includes things like attacks on homeless people but also attacks on police or expensive cars . 
  this category lists for 2001-2016\u00a0732 politically left motivated attacks with 491 violent offenses and 798 politically right motivated attacks with 159 violent offenses but this data is completely irrelevant for homeless specifically .
