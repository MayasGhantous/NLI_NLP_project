  according to a group that looks at this topic by trying to evaluate media reports ( usually a bit questionable but the best we got here ) they list [ the following stats ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/panorama/2016-gab-es-mindestens-17-tote-article19522841.html ) for 2016 : * 17 homeless were killed * 128 cases of assault , rape , threats with weapons and robbery . 
  * in 76 of these cases the attacker was homeless themselves . 
  2015 a total of 16 were killed with 124 being injured . 
  according to the [ amadeu antonio foundation ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/gewalt-obdachlose-101.html ) 25 of the 179 people who were killed in right-wing extremist attacks since 1990 were homeless . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.swr3.de/aktuell/nachrichten/immer-mehr-gewalt-gegen-obdachlose/-/id=47428/did=4351328/t5krrp/ ) source claims that 20 % of the 179 killed were homeless . 
  according to estimates there were 335.000 homeless people living in germany total in 2014 ( ~ 0.41 % of the total population ) . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/gewalt-obdachlose-101.html ) article lists polls done by the [ friedrich ebert foundation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_ebert_foundation ) according to which 19.4 % of people asked called homeless `` averse to working '' ( `` arbeitsscheu '' ) and one third are in favor of removing homeless people begging from inner cities . 
  for the sake of completeness since i mentioned begging : [ bavaria ] ( https://www.welt.de/regionales/bayern/article158287145/kampf-gegen-bettlerbanden-zeigt-wirkung.html ) recently started to crack down on [ organized begging syndicates ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/kampf-gegen-bettlerbanden-betteln-verboten-13002766.html ) which seems to be an issue in quite a few cities across germany . 
  basically we 're talking about cases where organized groups ( usually from eastern europe , romania specifically got a mention in the article above ) use women and children to earn 100 $ + per day per person which later gets sent abroad . 
  _______ some cases i found during this search : * [ 1995 ] ( http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2010-09/todesopfer-rechte-gewalt/seite-7 ) seven 16-24 year old neonazis wanted to `` beat bums '' ( `` penner klatschen '' ) , the 65 year old victim was beaten up after they caught him sleeping and a 22 year old killed him with a knife . 
  the main attacker was convicted to 10 years for murder and assault . 
  * [ 2008 ] ( https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article1532337/jugendliche-filmen-ihre-gewalt-gegen-obdachlose.html ) 16-year olds throwing piss over homeless people and beating them up in five cases . 
  they filmed it and put it on youtube . 
  according to that article the victims were still unknown at the time . 
  among other things he was made to get naked , his clothes were set on fire and they dragged him into the burning pile . 
  they also beat him with hammers . 
  as [ for punishment ] ( http://www.aachener-zeitung.de/lokales/region/obdachlosen-misshandelt-taeter-verurteilt-1.1303740 ) two of them were convicted for 3 years , one of the 16 year olds got 2 years on parole . 
  he 'll have to do social work and earn money which is supposed to go to the victim . 
  ________ well , fuck . 
   why would n't he be charged as an adult ? 
  he is adult , he 's 21 . . that 's not how this works legally , at least in germany . 
  according to german law people who have not finished their 14th year of life are children . 
  14-17 year olds are youth ( `` jugendliche '' ) . 
  18-20 year olds are young adults ( `` heranwachsende '' ) and [ \u00a7 105 jgg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_jgg/englisch_jgg.html#p0505 ) applies to figure out how exactly they need to be treated . 
  the basic idea is that in this range courts need to figure out whether his maturity resembles that of someone who would usually belong to the category of `` youth '' or if his deed is `` youth typical '' . 
  examples for this would be shoplifting , spraying graffiti , fare evasion or some light cases of physical assault . 
  an exception here is specifically [ \u00a7 32 jgg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_jgg/englisch_jgg.html#p0148 ) if the courts come into the situation where they need to judge multiple similar cases at once . 
  for example when someone shoplifts when he was 17 and again when he is 19 or 22 ( ! ), 
  he 's tried as youth either in both cases or in neither . 
  _______ none of this is relevant in this case and no , attempted murder is not considered a youth typical crime . 
  but in general there * are * clear cases of someone aged 21 or 22 being treated like someone aged 14-17 . 
   my brain ca n't pronounce `` gt '' , at all . 
  kurzgesa ** gt ** se ** ct ** arian just with a softer sound . 
  think `` reggt '' instead of `` rekt '' and then turn the beginning into an `` a-sound '' like the one you 'd make at the dentist if you 'd have to open your mouth completely . 
  ... did that help at all or make it worse ? 
  :3 ___ e : or you can just listen to [ this ] ( https://de.forvo.com/word/kurzgesagt/ ) one here i guess . 
   jack posobiec is also linked to the `` pizzagate '' affair , this farfetched conspiracy theory according to which a washington pizzeria was used as a facade for a network of pedophiles implicating members of the democratic party close to hillary clinton . 
  that 's not all he is linked to . 
  during the flynn story in the us i ended up hearing that name before . 
  michael flynn junior is a buddy of this jack posobiec and used to [ retweet ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mhsdz1e.png ) him quite a bit . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.mediaite.com/online/jake-tapper-rips-into-flynn-jr-over-pizzagate-does-someone-have-to-die-before-you-take-this-sht-seriously/ ) and [ here ] ( http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308723-flynns-son-spreads-conspiracy-theory-about-dc-pizza-shop ) are more articles pointing out that connection . 
  so ... there 's your connection to russia via flynn again . 
  when i looked into that back then it seemed like those two know each other from school/university . 
  they also went to the inauguration ball at the walter e. washington convention center together as well according to public facebook photos ( posobiecs russian speaking girlfriend also was involved there ) . 
  according to his public facebook information he 's also the `` dc bureau chief for rebel media '' and that connects him to lauren southern and the rest of the usual alt-right crew . 
  tl ; dr : `` pro-trump activist '' is a massive understatement , he 's straight up connected to the likes of flynn and other people close to trump and his campaign . 
  flying to london and back is cheaper than reasonable one-way train tickets to most german cities for me . 
  :3 germany specifically has the advantage of being surrounded by cool shit , from prague to strasbourg and from amsterdam to milan . 
  if it helps i also personally know lots of people who do n't use this advantage much but when you do it 's just crazy convenient . 
  i love yours , can always sing along despite not knowing any spanish !, 
  obligatory '' [ what has the echr ever done for us ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptfmay6m6aa ) '' - link . 
  it 's a so called [ auto-antynom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auto-antonym ) and stands for a sudden , large and positive change in this context . 
  both the german '' [ quantensprung ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantensprung ) '' and the french '' [ saut quantique ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/saut_quantique ) '' carry the same connotation . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's maybe less common in english but [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quantum_leap ) has it covered with that background as well . 
  yes , they were people too . 
  and every single individual or community deserves to be able to remember those who died and suffered . 
  it ** is ** important that we remember and understand that the participants of wars were people like you and me and not some abstract ` evil ' that ca n't happen again . 
  celebrating the victory of the war and remembering the fallen ones does ** not ** automatically mean that people want to glorify the atrocities and warcrimes associated with the regimes . 
   and unlike germany , which drastically reformed , russians have continued to cling to a barbaric culture of aggression that currently sees the murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians in syria , and tens of thousands in ukraine . 
  i think your framing here is the core issue all over this thread . 
  you praise germany , the country , and then condemn russians , the people . 
  remembering those who suffered by people who are related to them or knew and loved them is something that all of us should be able to respect . 
  the average russian today who wants to remember ancestors , friends and family that were lost during this madness is n't doing anything that deserves condemnation . 
  * if * you see people using this to glorify the soviet regime or to downplay soviet crimes that 's a completely different story and one that should be called out and where we should try to educate people wherever we can . 
  but merely remembering the men and women who fought and died ? 
  let them have that . 
  you want them to let you have that too . 
  i honestly think those are two completely different discussions . 
  it is one thing to remember those who suffered or died and another to celebrate what their regimes did before or after . 
  i have family that was shot at by allied planes on the way to school during ww2 when they were kids and those memories haunted them for their entire life . 
  the average russian soldier had roughly the same choice to participate in this madness as the average german or american one . 
  war is hell for * everyone * involved and the only ` winners ' are sometimes those who help spiral entire continents into chaos , death and suffering . 
  i obviously ca n't speak for everyone and i 'm sure there will even be enough fellow germans who disagree with me here , but i find it completely understandable to want to remember those who suffered and died as a whole without wanting to glorify atrocities some of them were involved in before , during or even after the war . 
  fuck war . 
  the only real choice we have in preventing it in the future is by trying to acknowledge the emotional connections we all have to what we or our ancestors suffered and unite together against the viciousness , distrust and the hatred that is the breeding grounds for aggressive ideologies . 
  for what it 's worth i with my cultural background do n't perceive the title of this thread or the idea of remembering soviets who fought against the nazi regime ` tanky ' or misleading at all . 
  there 's a massive difference between remembering fallen soldiers , families and loved ones and celebrating the regimes their lives were attached to . 
  when we talk about remembering those who fought the video '' [ the fallen of ww2 ] ( https://youtu.be/dwkpft-riou ) '' brings the lives lost together with a raw graphical representation like nothing else i 've seen so far . 
  i do recommend to watch the full thing , but if you 're in a hurry and only want to spend one minute on such a link [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwkpft-riou&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=332 ) scene really brings home how many soviet soldiers died in this war . 
  no one says to not be vigilant against corporate interest infiltrating politics and making things worse for the majority citizens . 
  the lobbying rules in the us for example are absolutely atrocious and european countries also had their fair share of scandals . 
  ** but ** it is one thing to look at the information available and treat it critically like your former source does and it 's another to move from there to `` pupped designed by the shadow government '' . 
  the former stands for critical thought , patriotism , the spirit of being well educated about politics and holding our politicians accountable . 
  the latter is the new version of '' [ the international jew ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_international_jew ) '' and all of its variations - something that 's more dangerous to our way of life than the conspiracies it proposes . 
  facts and information that are grounded in reality mean more than the wild conclusions we can dream up when we want to combine all of them to a pattern that concludes things we never actually had any evidence for . 
  hmm ... agreed . 
  i think one key to this thing ( apart from actually improving conditions ) is understanding the rhetoric , seeing the parallels and differentiating things properly . 
  of course globalism ( or european federalism ) are things that should be up for debate and critique . 
  corporate interest influencing politics negatively for citizens are something that 's important to talk and be informed about . 
  but it 's when there 's talk of `` media being the enemy of the people '' or judges being called out as some part of the establishment - or even fn candidates complaining how the evil established media and ` their ' banker candidate are conspiring against them ; those are the spots where the line needs to be drawn . 
  `` we 're not nazis , we 're just patriots unlike you ! '', 
  & nbsp ; i think that 's a big part of the reason why this right resurgence tries to frame issues as black and white on such a regular basis . 
  when the lines are `` closed borders vs open borders '' or `` unchecked immigration vs no immigration '' then they can gain ground even though the other side they 're presenting as a majority ideal is just as extremist as their proposal and something only very few people advocate for . 
  identifying this type of extremist rhetoric and calling it out for the blatant propaganda that it is is probably the best antibody we can develop . 
  `` i want background checks , controls or even surveillance and swift deportation of criminals '' is a strong conservative stance on immigration for example that needs to be included in political discussions while `` i want none of these muslims/foreigners/brown people in my country/as my neighbour '' is something that could be a hitler quote and needs to be recognized as such . 
  i was genuinely happy when macron in his first speech did n't even try to alienate le pen voters any further . 
  i 'd argue that genuine extremists are rare , even within those movements . 
  those who are n't a part of them are the ones that need to get dragged back into a reasonable political and democratic discourse that does n't involve the ones who are wolves in sheep 's clothing . 
  that 's also in part where the `` socialist '' framing in national socialism comes from .
