  since clearly there is an interest in the common good of all people but it 's * those other people * that society needs to get rid of first so that the * good people * can finally usher in a prosperous future . 
  after all these `` social democrats '' and `` communists '' people used to vote for would never have the guts to be strong for the people so that the true cause of their misery could be uprooted . 
   thus we can see the two great differences between races : aryanism means ethical perception of work and that which we today so often hear -- socialism , community spirit , common good before own good . 
  jewry means egoistic attitude to work and thereby mammonism and materialism , the opposite of socialism . 
  ... socialism as the final concept of duty , the ethical duty of work , not just for oneself but also for one 's fellow man 's sake , and above all the principle : common good before own good , a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income . 
  and we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people . 
  we are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are aryan , and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism .

  ______ edit : now that you said it , i did n't even realize that the whole `` anti-globalist '' and `` anti-establishment-rothschild-candidate '' - angle is eerily close to the idea of a global financial jewish conspiracy just without the obvious anti-semitic component . 
  that 's an easy 3/3 main discussion points of the early national socialist movement in germany covered . 
  fun fact , [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #history ) were the assumptions & anticipations the founders had with regards to the electoral college :  * individual electors would be elected by citizens on a district-by-district basis . 
   * each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting . 
   * candidates would not pair together on the same ticket with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president . 
   * the system as designed would rarely produce a winner , thus sending the election to congress . 
  and yes , people like hamilton & madison were pretty vocal when they realized states started going around these assumptions , especially because e.g. 
  madison wrote about the [ dangers of factions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalist_no._10#the_question_of_faction ) years earlier . 
  nobody listened to them though . 
   common good before own good , a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income . 
  and we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people . 
  what do you think of this quote ? 
  me personally it reminded me quite a bit of `` alt-right '' rhetoric . 
  i really do n't think it 's as grim as people make it out to be when you look at e.g. 
  the presidental 1st rounds which * should be * one of the best possible indicators for party support on a national scale . 
  * yes * there is a clear indicator of growth and * yes * other elections look better for the fn than the presidential one but we ca n't look at the 35 % of the current 2nd round and somehow believe that a third of france wants the fn to rule them . 
  14.39 % - 1988 presidental 1st round 15.00 % - 1995 presidental 1st round 16.86 % - 2002 presidental 1st round 10.44 % - 2007 presidental 1st round 17.90 % - 2012 presidental 1st round 21.30 % - 2017 presidental 1st round, 
   they did n't teach economic equality , but racial superiority . 
  while * technically * correct , you have to expand on the national * socialist * context here to get the full picture . 
  what you wrote above is only half of the story . 
  part of the ideology is to present socialist approaches framed in a very specific way . 
  `` socialism '' is advocated as something that is desired ** but ** only for those who belong to the specific definition of a nation , in the case of the nazis this comes down to the whole aryan and anti-semitic ideal but this can obviously have various forms . 
  the worker and small business owner gets told that the ` classic ' left ca n't solve their problems because they lack the resolve and the nationalist spirit to do what is actually necessary : the removal of elements that do n't belong to the nation . 
  here is a hitler quote ( delivered in 1920 , published in 1933 ) that illustrates this rather well :  thus we can see the two great differences between races : aryanism means ethical perception of work and that which we today so often hear -- socialism , community spirit , common good before own good . 
  jewry means egoistic attitude to work and thereby mammonism and materialism , the opposite of socialism . 
  ... socialism as the final concept of duty , the ethical duty of work , not just for oneself but also for one 's fellow man 's sake , and above all the principle : common good before own good , a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income . 
  and we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people . 
  we are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are aryan , and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism . 
  in a nutshell it 's a * very * specific framing that tells the people that you want `` socialism '' but that to bring the promised prosperity you first have to rid society of all these `` undesirable '' elements that are preventing this from being possible . 
  this is extremely crucial to understand in todays world because it 's a very similar rhetoric that we 're seeing within the german afd , the french fn or the trump campaign . 
   for example , le pen was clearly not liberal , the opposite actually . 
  she was close to melenchon in economics for example which was far left . 
  that 's what makes her so dangerous . 
  it 's the * exact * same image that was responsible for the rise of the nazi party in germany . 
  '' * these * people over there are responsible for what 's going wrong in this country and no one but me can save you from them . 
  when * i * come into power i will put * my * people first and we can finally rid out nation of * those other people * who are lazy , leeches and in general do n't belong to us . 
  no one else will be willing to do what is needed like i am because the entire system is conspiring together to destroy us all . '', 
  as for your first point , yeah , you 're right . 
  it 's probably not the best spot ever to pick that fight . 
  for history specifically a trend i 've been noticing since the us election is that the entire `` hitler topic '' boils down to the hitler of 1939 onwards but not the figure that rose through politics since 20 years before that . 
  those are the spots where i think that spreading education about backgrounds can only be a good thing . 
  a key component of fascist movements is that they * can * start slowly and even subtly at times until the majority of the people support them - at least in parts because of the power they already gained . 
   third , and this is anecdotal , i know plenty of people that prick right through the socialist rethoric of current populists . 
  the problem is that these are the people that never would have voted for them anyway . 
  and the people that do vote for them are n't the people taking your message to heart . 
  preaching to the choir as they say . 
  hmmm ... 
  i tend to disagree here , at least if i specifically think about how this current movement developed here in germany . 
  our neo-right wing party got a decent sized chunk of votes ( ~ 40 % ) from traditionally left leaning voters simply * because * they played this game rather well until a few weeks ago . 
  those kind of voters that changed from centrist or leftish positions to the extreme right are the ones that you * need * to talk to . 
  they 're not the passionate core of these movements but they 're being sucked into that type of propaganda machine because it seems like a genuinely reasonable choice at a quick glance . 
  analogue a lot of a the people who recently moved from voting traditional center-right parties to the extreme are also the ones i consider worth talking to . 
  the basic idea that they feel as if those conservative parties failed them in some way is n't extremist in itself . 
  it may be overreacting , it may be irrational - but it 's a somewhat understandable choice , one that can be swayed back in the other direction in the future . 
  i 'm honestly really glad that macron addressed this in his very first speech already : those people are n't some fascist enemy of the state even though the parties they vote for might be . 
  they 're people like you and me who have issues that need to be taken seriously , even if some of them boil down to irrational fears , not being well educated or simply being angry with what they perceive as the establishment . 
  butttttt ... then you 're also right that at least i personally feel like i had much more success with these talks from person to person in real life than on reddit . 
  at least i 'd like to think so , simply because reddit is n't exactly a place with great feedback in this regard . 
   he used socialist rhetoric to become popular but in practice he was not a socialist . 
  that 's completely correct . 
  it 's a problem however when people frame it in a way that implies the `` socialist '' in national socialism has no meaning whatsoever and needs to be ignored while in reality presenting a nationalism with socialist elements was part of the massive success formula . 
  examples are the [ national socialist factory cell organization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_factory_cell_organization ) , which while on a large scale unsuccessful was a workers union . 
  overall the nazis helped organize strikes and had massive anti-capitalist rhetoric . 
  the basic idea is this : the worker is n't happy . 
  the left is busy with infighting ( social-democrats were the main enemy of the communists even until the point until it was too late ) and so the right takes nationalistic propaganda ( anti-semitic sentiment , xenophobia ) and frames it in way that sounds eerily similar to what you 'd expect from a socialist . 
  `` you 're unhappy and i will be the one giving you work and a great life because unlike those lefties i understand that the real issue are capitalist jews trying to control all of us and i promise to end this . '', 
  the nazis told small business owners that they 're against capitalist jewish businesses and will help them by getting rid of them . 
  once in power they did just that - and then cozied up to other businesses . 
  the nazis told the workers that * real * and * proper * leaders would put them first , ahead of jewish or other interests . 
  again we 're seeing a classic socialist promise here to make fascist agenda more agreeable . 
  ________ that 's why the current topic basically going `` lol t_d people say hitler was n't right wing , he was a socialist '' is something i consider extremely dangerous . 
  hitler was right-wing extremist * and * combined it with socialist propaganda to gobble up the traditional socialist voters . 
  * exactly * the same as we 're seeing from the fn in france , the afd in germany and trump in the us . 
  it 's an angle that we 're currently seeing exploited simply * because * these groups can pose as national * and * socialist while still trying to distance themselves from national socialism because : `` the hitler of 1939 had nothing to do with socialism - see , we 're fine ! '', 
   `` those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . '', 
  this thread is massive evidence that we 're in the process of doing just that by simplifying it too much . 
  _______ [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3vdkls/why_did_the_nazis_first_label_themselves_as_the/ ) is an / r/askhistorians thread on this that also contains an important hitler quote to establish the point i 'm trying to make . 
  it 's this redefinition of socialism that we 're currently seeing again :  thus we can see the two great differences between races : aryanism means ethical perception of work and that which we today so often hear -- socialism , community spirit , common good before own good . 
  jewry means egoistic attitude to work and thereby mammonism and materialism , the opposite of socialism . 
  ... socialism as the final concept of duty , the ethical duty of work , not just for oneself but also for one 's fellow man 's sake , and above all the principle : common good before own good , a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income . 
  and we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people . 
  we are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are aryan , and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism . 
  did you know that [ more than 80 % of british people ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=697 ) think families in bangladesh have more than 2.5 kids nowadays ? 
  this anti-bangladeshian sentiment needs to stop . 
  clearly a chimpanzee picking random options would be less discriminatory !, 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dd5avxlcc ) , have a video from the ceo of [ cambridge analytica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_analytica ) . 
  you might be able to recognize some names in their wiki article . 
  it 's so cool to think about how much we owe unity in europe to people like mitterrand & kohl . 
  i could go for some macron & mutti in my lifetime and then for some macron & schulz for round \\ # 2 . 
  [ please ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/69mpw9/macronleaks_financement_ill%c3%a9gal_de_campagne/ ) , / r/france had that covered . 
   anyway it strenghtens my point even further . 
  because they gained that much not in 15 years , but in 6 years .
