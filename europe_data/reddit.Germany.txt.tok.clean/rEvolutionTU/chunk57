  on the contrary , it weakens your argument that `` their support doubled since 2002 '' . 
  you ca n't just go `` they gained that much not in 15 years but in 6 years '' and pretend it 's true . 
  & nbsp ; 15.00 % - 1995 presidental 1st round 16.86 % - 2002 presidental 1st round 10.44 % - 2007 presidental 1st round 17,90 % - 2012 presidental 1st round 21,30 % - 2017 presidental 1st round & nbsp ; that 's a 19 % increase in votes over 5 years and 26 % rise over 15 years with lots of weaknesses in between . 
  sure , the rise is bigger when we look at d\u00e9partements but there the fn was underrepresented to begin with . 
  i think 2007-2012 period is actually the most interesting bit here : a much larger growth than the recent one which happened during the time of the refugee crisis and massive terror attacks on french soil . 
  or we just consider 2007 the outlier since the fn has always been around 15-20 % since 20 years now . 
  again , that 's not a terrible thing ** if ** it gets rid of inefficiencies and distributes the money gained in other areas . 
  he was very specific in this debates about the whole `` i ca n't spend money in areas where we need it if i do n't cut it where we can afford to use less '' which is both realistic and refreshing to hear . 
  your initial statement :  in 2002 jean marie le pen got ~ 18 % , now his daughter got ~ 35 % so she pretty much doubled his score . 
  if the trend continues now you 're presenting evidence for the fn gaining ground ** since 2011 under marine ** . 
  the point is that the trend you 're describing does not exist if you look at 2002-2017 , it 's a recent trend under marine . 
  and once you look at specific examples ( e.g. 
  1st round presidential elections ) it went from 14 % to 21 % or 15 % to 25 % . 
  so yes , there is an increase . 
  but it 's both recent and in the ~ 50 % gain range over the last 6 years . 
  obligatory plug for www.qwant.com - they 're based in france , too .

  is a core concept of nazism . 
  and it 's exactly what we 're seeing in this current right-wing extremist resurgence . 
   i do n't even know why they kept up the facade . 
  because them making classic socialist promises gained them support . 
  it 's basically `` socialist ideals for everyone who belongs to our definition of nation - those who do n't belong to it are responsible for us not having a great life already '' . 
  the `` socialist '' in that name * is * a crucial ingredient to understand the movement . 
  i wrote a longer post [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69so8h/macron_is_the_new_french_president/dh9s7d4/ ) but the issue with your explanation is that it 's simplified and imprecise . 
  a * massive * part of the rise of the nazi party was the mixture of socialist rhetoric with nationalistic ideologies . 
  the ` socialist ' pretty much refers to `` work and a great life for everyone except those who do n't belong to my definition of nation '' . 
   no see at t_d , hitler was n't right wing , he was a socialist it 's super important to be precise here . 
  the `` national socialist german workers ' party '' and their nazi ideology was * clearly * not socialist in the sense as we know it but ` being socialist ' was a massive part of their early success . 
  it 's important to note that the german version uses a compound word ( nationalsozialistisch ) which makes more sense in this context . 
  before the nsdap hitler was involved in another party where he specifically removed `` socialist '' from the name in favor of `` worker 's party '' to convey the same meaning . 
  it 's only `` nationalsocialism '' that made the the word acceptable to him . 
  the party started with anti-big business , anti-bourgeois , and anti-capitalist rhetoric in the 1920s ( hitler lead them since 1921 ) . 
  their nationalist ideals ( e.g. 
  the anti-semitic direction ) did have a socialist framing : '' * those * people are the reason you do n't have a good life and once we get rid of them ( which no one else will do ! ), 
  your life will be amazing . '', 
  they kept rallying worker 's behind them ( made even easier by the great depression ) , they even supported unions and strikes at certain points . 
   `` from the camp of bourgeois tradition , it takes national resolve , and from the materialism of the marxist dogma , living , creative socialism . '', 
  ______ the long story short is that it 's the combination of being nationalist * and * socialist ( for everyone who does n't belong to the nation ) was a core concept of nazi rhetoric and that 's also something we 're seeing in this current right-wing populist resurgence . 
  because it * works * and starts off by sounding somewhat reasonable and relateable . 
  i 'd go as far as saying that 's the trick the right-wing extremists figured out again : `` if our candidate poses in the middle / as inconsistent we can convince lots of useful idiots to vote for our guy . '', 
  that 's the trick of right-wing populism : you wo n't know until they 're in charge . 
  / r/le _ canard u mean . 
  once you * genuinely * realize what trying to take over the world with force would mean a diplomatic victory becomes the only viable approach . 
  glorifying war and conquering others only sounds cool in an abstract and detached way . 
  if there is one lesson germany learned then it 's that co-operation is the only winning strategy that allows you to stay human as we know it . 
  i also think it 's unfair to say `` 35 % wanted her to win ! '', 
  when she barely had above 21 % in the first round . 
  we had multiple french people in some of the threads who made the argument that they 're against her but will vote for her because they believe that if she wins now the fn loses all strength . 
  it 's a weak and accelerationist argument * but * it some argument nevertheless . 
  i also like how she already tried to frame her as `` people voted for patriots and france ( me ) or against france and for globalism ! '', 
  - `` people voted * me * as the primary opposition ! '', 
  and shit like that . 
  this was just the first step . 
  the next is not giving an inch in the an elections and then for macron to not fuck up when compromises can be reached that bring other parties on board . 
  yeah , i get what you mean . 
  maybe i 'm a bit naive here but i feel like this is inevitable anyway . 
  when people can move freely and communicate freely culture mixes , gets shared , reinterpreted and something similar but still different will become mainstream . 
  that 's not a bad thing , it 's how all the cultures we today know and love came to be in the first place . 
  things are going to be fine if no one tries to be militant about these things . 
   under 30 o_o [ that book ] ( https://www.amazon.de/etudes-fran%c3%a7aises-d%c3%a9couvertes-decouvertes-sch%c3%bclerbuch/dp/3125232406 ) came out in 1997 , so if someone started french in 7th grade they 'd be born ~ 1984 and turn 33 this year !, 
  could be from [ 1994 ] ( https://www.amazon.de/etudes-fran%c3%a7aises-d%c3%a9couvertes-grammatisches-beiheft/dp/3125232422/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=utf8&amp;psc=1&amp;refrid=59yx90w4n10z50r3dnnn ) , too . 
  i 'm having a bit of a hard time finding out which was actually the first edition of this . 
  discrimination !, 
  to add to what the other guy said [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0s_gmoz68g ) is a video of one of our first lessons in action . 
  let 's just say it was pretty damn memorable . 
  please , i 'm aware of that . 
  that 's why there is a big '' ** if ** he turns out to be amazing '' in my statement above . 
  so far all we know is that he * sounds * promising . 
  now he needs to deliver . 
  that 's looking at a different trend than you were initially talking about though . 
  that 's like me posting a nazi advertisement and tagging it `` 1940 conservative poster '' =p at least to me in the context of uk politics `` conservative '' refers to the `` conservative party '' - ** especially ** when the poster then talks about tory and labour . 
  i posted the [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69rjmk/the_more_things_change_the_more_they_stay_the/dh8utyb/ ) further down , the gist is this :  update ( 05/08/2013 ) : further research reveals that this flyer is one of several hundred printed up by colin jordan 's national socialist movement , which had its headquarters in notting hill , though jordan was then based in coventry . 
  apparently one of the newsreel archives has footage of this and i will try to search their archives next in an attempt to track down the whole story . 
   looking over the rhine , i expect a lot from schulz . 
  i hope he will win , he truly loves europe and a schulz-macron tandem can do great thing for our whole continent . 
  i think that 's going to be a rather long shot . 
  our centre-left only now started to recover from the green/left coalition we had until 2005 that severely disappointed their voters and eroded trust in them . 
  i 'd really not get my hopes up . 
  that 's pretty much all i remember , im sorry . 
  i can understand some of the memes though . 
  they 're tremendous . 
   especially in germany all you get taught in school is what germany did . 
  that 's flat out not true . 
  as i mentioned further down in the chain i was aware of * most * expulsions , just not the balkan ones specifically . 
  there are also other people from my state saying they * did * get this info in school so i might have just forgotten about it in the decade since . 
  if i understand it correctly according to the curriculum expulsions in general are discussed but which ones specifically is up to the teachers discretion . 
  apart from that , thanks for the link though . 
  bbc documentaries always win . 
   it will be a great 10 years . 
  tbh if he actually turns out to be amazing you guys would be the first ones to throw the term limit away again . 
  how much did the fn get in the elections in between ? 
  if this was a trend we 'd expect a steady rise and all that .
