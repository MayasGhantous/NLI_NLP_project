   petry ( already a rank outsider ) does n't stand a chance in hell she 's not running . 
  also her party refused her direction and pretty much dropped the `` honest , we 're not far-right !, 
  '' - facade they had up for a bit . 
  it already caused a drop in polls , they 'll most likely keep hovering in the 5-10 % range from now on . 
  please , we 'll get much less attention than the french anyway . 
  too boring . 
  i like my politics boring . 
   if that is n't trolling i do n't know what is . 
  [ this is . 
  man his speech is amazing . 
  i 'm ** so ** hoping this guy is actually for real and will be a positive force for the french people and everyone on the continent . 
  yes , i was being sarcastic and confident in the multiple exclamation marks conveying that properly . 
  `` marine is the only candidate against the system !!!, 
  the french people were asked to vote for or against france and they voted against her !!!, 
  ! 11 '' that rhetoric already . 
  it 's not gon na stop either . 
  she and her successors will just keep yelling `` im the only solution '' until it eventually maybe ends up working . 
  i ca n't speak for france but over here for example that makes complete sense - * religion * is not a problem because the things that are considered religion are n't causing these issues . 
  if you 're an extremist that attacks basic societal values these things are no longer covered under freedom of religion . 
  i 'd not be surprised if this is similar in france . 
   too bad i 'm stuck in one you 're not stuck - french and german are beautiful languages . 
  how is that a change in position ? 
   `` france had sometimes made mistakes in unfairly targeting muslims ''  `` no religion is a problem in france today , '' he told the crowd . 
  `` if the state should be neutral , which is at the heart of secularism , we have a duty to let everybody practice their religion with dignity . '', 
  these quotes talk about muslims , not islamist extremism , terrorism or organizations that spread these ideologies or hate-speech in general . 
  i 'm also for religious freedom and see loads of muslims being targeted unfairly . 
  at the same time i can oppose radical islamism , right-wing-extremists and left-wing-extremists . 
  these things are n't mutually exclusive . 
   so he does n't even acknowledge the extremists being extremist , based on all the articles i have read . 
  as someone who watched the last debate : that 's a flat out lie and he specifically talked about his plans on how to deal with it . 
  this includes stronger security forces and the banning of organizations . 
  it 's straight up disgusting . 
  `` how can i keep the vote of the far-right while seeming as nice and moderate as i can ? '', 
  lol they 're renaming the national front ? 
  and she 's already back into war-speech and tries to paint it as `` patriots '' vs `` globalists '' - still the same divisive far-right as usual . 
  her frame already is `` people voted for me as the biggest opposition ! '', 
  as if the an election wo n't be a thing . 
  / r/subredditdrama might have a field day with this, 
  media blackout until then and by now enough of the vote is counted . 
  man , i love that approach . 
  easy game , easy life . 
  congratulations to you guys over there and merci for being awesome . 
  time to get to work soon ( tm ) . 
  i was more poking fun a [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69qewe/dear_french_friends_please_go_out_and_vote_even/dh8m98n/ ) top comment from the other thread . 
  =p sounds pretty cool and smooth over there though . 
  it 's okay - we still got wine , beer , sangria and vodka in the union . 
  that 's like 2 hours to vote what the hell ? 
  would n't surprise me if it 's just a good flair pick if you 're not from the uk but only speak english . 
  i 'm * still * convinced i woke up in the wrong timeline when trump got elected . 
  not happening again . 
  not created by god , no rain during the election , not even a mormon choir . 
  the volkspartij won the election we did it wilders made it, 
  that 'd be one way to distribute eu funds according to the will of the people . 
  france24 mentioned those are le pen supporters filming her while she 's driving to her `` party '' location . 
  i ca n't speak for him but i fully agree . 
  ... what are all these celebrations in here , i thought there 's still a blackout till 20:00 ? 
  tbh just the * option * of picking your allies like that is a good enough reason for a strong eu . 
  if we do n't work together we 'll either brawl each other or end up controlled by non-european interests . 
  hmm ... 
  i 'm clicking through the [ current curriculum ] ( http://www.isb-gym8-lehrplan.de/contentserv/3.1.neu/g8.de/index.php?storyid=26818 ) and ca n't find it being mentioned specifically , my school time was 10 + years ago though . 
  * expulsions * in general are mentioned but nothing specific as to which ones exactly . 
  jahrhunderts '' is also something i 'm abso-fucking-lutely sure we did n't have in our curriculum during the final years . 
  i 'm genuinely confused here but do n't have any of my old stuff around anymore . 
  mhm . 
  [ found it !, 
  ] ( http://cameron-cloggysmoralcompass.blogspot.de/2013/08/is-british-conservative-party.html ) [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3sjp40/an_album_of_artistic_conservative_party_posters/ ) is an / r/ukpolitics thread from a year ago in which this was posted . 
  / u/ieya404 had the following to say about it :  assuming you read the article you found that in , you 'd know that particular one was n't a conservative piece at all ;   update ( 05/08/2013 ) : further research reveals that this flyer is one of several hundred printed up by colin jordan 's national socialist movement , which had its headquarters in notting hill , though jordan was then based in coventry . 
  apparently one of the newsreel archives has footage of this and i will try to search their archives next in an attempt to track down the whole story . 
   there certainly are some other shockers in conservative history , but that one at least was n't theirs . 
  tl ; dr : seems like it 's quite literal fake news from 1964 . 
  no , we could however deduct from that that they feel best represented by him in some way shape or form . 
  it 's kind of a moot point however since we already know that extreme right-wing candidates are something the [ is considers beneficial to their cause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#purpose_and_strategy ) . 
  the more currently happy and peaceful muslims feel threatened the easier it is to radicalize them further . 
  again , the 18 % who openly supported her father did n't just vanish into thin air - they 're now supporting marine as the spearhead of their movement . 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  it 's a bit of a dumb point to make without proper context since it * is * how basically all of them come into power . 
  overall i 'd say that while hitler comparisons are outright retarded ( because people associate 1939-1945 hitler with it ) comparisons with hitler 's * rise to power * are incredibly important . 
  someone like him did n't pop out of nowhere , the things we associate with him and his regime were * built * upon almost 20 years of steady growth . 
  we can see similar rhetoric ( anti-specific group , nationalist , appeals to working classes ) , we can see similar attacks on institutions and the press , we can see people surrounding themselves with dubious company ( steve bannon comes to mind ) . 
  i think it 's crucial to understand that by the time a fascist movement is in full force there is a good chance the majority of people within a country can get dragged into it even if they were much more moderate before . 
   also , the term popular vote just makes me think of anti-trump americans that have no clue how political systems in other countries are set up . 
  while trump can just fuck right off , those guys still annoy the hell out of me . 
  haha . 
  sorry , did n't even consider a trigger warning there . 
  what makes this even more funny to me is that i just recently learned that the electoral college in the us was initially [ designed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #history ) around completely different ideas than what we have today and actually makes sense in a context without parties in which electors vote their conscience . 
  for quite some time i was confused by some seemingly obvious issues with the us system as a whole ( control over the judiciary or the two party system come to mind ) but all those disappear when you look at the original vision . 
  that 's partially why founders like hamilton and especially [ madison ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federalist_no._10#the_question_of_faction ) were quick to oppose the states turning the individual electors into glorified mascots of their constituents . 
  turns out no one really listened to them though . 
  what you 're talking about is quite literally called * inclusive nationalism * because it aims to create a sense of union within the nation based on inclusive criteria that at least in theory every individual can fulfill if they want to do so . 
  this can have positive connotations ( `` you and me look different but we get along because we agree on the same basic laws and rules '' ) or negative ones ( `` you and me look different but we get along because we need to get rid of those other fucks who do n't belong to us '' ) . 
  exclusive nationalism are things that aim to define the group ( the nation ) based on things it excludes . 
  the goal here is to make the group as a whole more homogeneous or sharply define it which makes it feel more connected . 
  this again has positive examples ( `` you ca n't become a citizen if you do n't learn our language '' ) but this is where in general most of the negative stuff we know is from , especially when it aims to exclude already existing citizens ( `` you 're not our color of skin you should n't even be part of this group '' ) . 
  [ this link ] ( http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~wmills/course203/7nationalism.html ) gives some more examples for the two basic concepts and elaborates . 
  just to chime in here , especially after the short nationalism vs patriotism debate - language is a bit of a bitch here . 
  you 're * both * arguing pro-nationalism . 
  the trick is that you are arguing for * inclusive nationalism * while he argues for * exclusive nationalism * . 
  more specifically you 're pretty much arguing for some form of inclusive european nationalism . 
  * inclusive * nationalism are things that aim to give excuse for uniting heterogeneous individuals under the concept of a nation . 
  this can have positive connotations ( `` you and me look different but we get along because we agree on the same basic laws and rules '' ) or negative ones ( `` you and me look different but we get along because we need to get rid of those other fucks who do n't belong to us '' ) .
