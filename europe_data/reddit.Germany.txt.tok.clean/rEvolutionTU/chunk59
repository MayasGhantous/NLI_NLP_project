  most of what people call `` patriotism '' usually falls under these categories . 
  * exclusive * nationalism are things that aim to define the group ( the nation ) based on things it excludes . 
  the goal here is to make the group as a whole more homogeneous or sharply define it which makes it feel more connected . 
  this again has positive examples ( `` you ca n't become a citizen if you do n't learn our language '' ) but this is where in general most of the negative stuff we know is from , especially when it aims to exclude already existing citizens ( `` you 're not our color of skin you should n't even be part of this group '' ) . 
  [ this link ] ( http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~wmills/course203/7nationalism.html ) gives some more examples for the two basic concepts and elaborates . 
  i think that 's a * really * difficult question to answer . 
  the [ enf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_nations_and_freedom ) and [ efd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_freedom_and_direct_democracy#membership ) eu groups all share a similar background and we can assume members at least loosely share ideologies and co-operate on some level . 
  the problem here is how these parties operate , i 'll explain what i mean based on the german afd but to my knowledge the fn operates similarly . 
  basically overall ( at least until a few weeks ago ) the party portrays a rather moderate right-wing image . 
  they advocate socially conservative policies and economically position themselves more on the social side . 
  the main target of the voting population are both those who feel like the center-right is n't right enough but * also * a decent chunk of voters on the left side of the spectrum who are n't satisfied with how the social policies from that side turned out . 
  the trick is that these parties have people who openly make the classic `` alt right '' / neonazi statements , then they get denounced by the party leadership / apologize or similar things . 
  if they get caught being blatant about it especially the fn for example is known to actually expel them . 
  this creates a climate which gives both moderate voters ( `` see , they 're against this crap , they 're not so bad ! '' ), 
  but also extremist voter ( `` they only had to pull back on this because * the establishment * ! '' ), 
  an excuse to justify their support . 
  it also means we literally do n't know if the party leadership shares these values but we have to assume they at least tolerate them - unless someone is too open / radical about them . 
  basically they carefully nurture the image of being somewhat reasonable conservative populists while also making sure the actual extremists stick around within their ranks . 
  so , yeah , we really do n't know how much influence these neonazi groups have on these parties but no one would be surprised if they 'd bring out the steve bannons of this world if they came to power . 
  hey , there was a guy basically saying `` i vote le pen ama '' in the other thread who was at 300 + upvotes . 
  then he deleted his posts , presumably because some people ca n't stop acting like dicks even when people give reasonable replies . 
  correct , did i argue against that ? 
  oo i called the comparison obvious because it 's still a great example for how a candidate without overwhelming support by the population came to power via completely democratic means . 
  is thr sbrddt fr ths ? 
  if the majority of wolves feel represented by someone who looks like a sheep then questioning what interests that candidate represents is a good start . 
  it * might * just want to eat people . 
  analogue you can tell things about the respective candidates by looking at who primarily supports m\u00e9lenchon or who primarily supports macron . 
  it 's just that in those cases their respective bases align with the image the candidates are portraying - in le pens case these do n't always align . 
  sorry , you 're right - his * party * got 33 % of the popular vote during the last free elections . 
  i do n't think that 's a fair comparison to begin with - the us system ( due to the electoral college and effectively being a two party state ) has voter apathy pretty much built into the modern version of its original design . 
  systems like the one france or germany have encourage more participation simply by having multiple choices to make already . 
   it 's such a small part of what influenced the genocidal side regime that it 's irrelevant . 
  it 's what brought them massive amounts of votes and popular support in the beginning , that 's a bit more than `` irrelevant '' . 
  being a socialist * and * a nationalist is a massive red flag because it 's literally how ** the ** nazi party started . 
  when the narrative is `` i want you guys to live great and it 's * those guys * fault that you 're not doing so already but i 'll help you get rid of them ! '', 
  then that 's 100 % in line with the national socialist aka nazi playbook . 
  so yes , if bernie starts talking about how it 's the muslims , the blacks the gays or the [ insert minority here ] fault that people are being treated unfairly and he starts promising to rid society of these evils then yes , people should watch out . 
  i still did not say that , even if you 'd like to portray it as such . 
  what i * did * say was that if you vote le pen you vote for the candidate that racists and xenophobes drool over and will support no matter what . 
   so how do you know that all the voters from 2002 are all the things you accuse them of ? 
  because that 's what the candidate they voted for back then openly advocated ? 
   that indirect experience affected my opinion on open borders . 
  which open borders ? 
  i ca n't speak for france but over here the only people advocating for actual open borders are left-extremists . 
  what i 'd * personally * want are strong and enforced eu borders but starting to push for strong borders within the eu is a really bad idea , * especially * since it just shifts around the problem but does n't deal with them . 
  i distinctly remember the expulsions from east-prussia and other eastern european areas from but the balkan stuff was new to me . 
  i even had glorious 13 years of bavarian education and would like to think i payed attention back then . 
  i 'm ... pretty sure we did n't hear about that during my 13 years of glorious bavarian education . 
  you mean like the ** national socialist german workers ' party ** ? 
  they framed themselves as a worker movement in the beginning making pretty much the exact same promises people knew from the left . 
  their primary agendas were anti-capitalist , anti-semitic and anti-liberal - hell they even organized strikes and supported unions . 
  it was only after they came to power that they openly regarded social-democrats and communists as a threat and started prosecuting them . 
  would you classify jean-marie le pen as a xenophobe , racist , anti-semite and someone who would love to have a fascist regime ? 
  who do you think the people who supported him 15 years ago vote for now ? 
  that 's the base marine represents . 
  to be fair she does call herself a nationalist and people seem to talk about her socialist policies . 
  once you put nationalist and socialist together ... you get the idea . 
  the memes you guys are pulling out will be hard to top when it 's our turn to face google translate during our election . 
  let 's hope it ends well . 
  would you like to tell me who the 18 % of xenophobes , racists and homophobes who voted for le pen in 2002 would vote today ? 
  exactly : they 'd * still * vote fn because it 's the option furthest to this side of the spectrum . 
  either le pen betrays that base and does not act as if she belongs to that spectrum or she betrays those who do n't belong to that base by acting as if she is loyal to her base . 
  none of this happened here . 
  fact is we * know * both trump and le pen have in common that they have the full support of the extreme right . 
  analogue we 'd know that hillary would have the full support of the extreme left for example because there are only two options in the us . 
  however , in a multi-party system this is a completely legitimate question . 
  every single right-wing extremist votes fn . 
  those people believe le pen is by far the candidate who represents their interest and that 's the interest you 're carrying along with a vote in that direction . 
  they are - but they share the same geographical destiny if you want to put it in that kind of term . 
  if the eu does n't manage to become a strong entity then individual nations will go back to brawling each other or being pawns of influences from outside . 
  that alone should be enough reason to bond together . 
  it 's also a very short-term perspective . 
  especially if we look at the us right now the framing of the ` failed ' bans is very specific and highly successful : `` look , these * liberals * are blocking this . 
  i 'd love to make this country safer but these * judges * stopped me from doing so because they sympathize with * terrorists * . 
  the * press * is an enemy of the people , too . '', 
  it normalizes a conspiracy , it attacks the judiciary and the free press - both fundamental things to a functioning democracy . 
  we have no idea what a full term of this type of state-based propaganda will do to the us so far . 
   i do not think i could 've told him myself without a large amount of insults to put it a bit less aggressive than the other reply , i get what you 're saying and understand that feeling ( hell , i 'm like that too often as well ) - but it does n't help . 
  the very least we can do is give the seemingly reasonable people an open ear , talk to them and keep them within the political discourse . 
  * especially * when there are only two options to vote for this is incredibly important because it 's in both sides interest to build a violent , loud and loyal following that absorbs everyone who has a more moderate point of view . 
  when they abuse office you can punish them in the upcoming election . 
  i obviously ca n't speak for other countries but when the german center-left/green ` betrayed ' their voterbase between ~ 2000 and 2005 for example the main left party dropped from 40 % support all the way to 23 % . 
  they 're only now starting to slowly recover . 
  the issue is that if you manage to elect someone who wants to dismantle that very democratic system you just possibly made it incredibly hard to get rid of the new leadership in the future . 
  that kind of potential * only * exists with far-left and far-right extremists . 
  all good , i actually was n't aware of that . 
  [ here ] ( http://writingexplained.org/was-vs-were-difference ) are two [ sources ] ( https://www.grammarly.com/blog/conditional-sentences-was-instead-of-were/ ) in case anyone else stumbles upon this and is clueless . 
  cheers . 
   if macron win , same shit in five years ( regardless of if you like him or not ) , however if le pen wins , either she turns out to be a good president ( wich i honestly think she can be ) or she fucks up and her party has no chances in the future ( in 5 years or later ) i gave a longer answer to this basic stance [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69qewe/dear_french_friends_please_go_out_and_vote_even/dh8lsxk/ ) but the gist is : i fully agree with you . 
  she seems less harmful than most people seem to portray her , some proposals sound reasonable and it * could * be that she was riding the far-right voters just to get into a strong position but intends to betray their goals in the long run . 
  i also fully agree that france overall * should * be a strong enough republic to not give her an inch if she decides to push too far . 
  * but * , and to me this is more crucial than all the above potential , if she is what her voterbase wants her to be ( remember , there effectively is no competition to the right of the fn ) then this is an incredibly dangerous game to play . 
  fascists do n't play by the rules . 
  if there * are * flaws in the current system they will aim to exploit them and if there are n't any they will aim to destabilize things until they exist . 
  what if there 's a national emergency and she pushes for things that the france of today would never stand for at a time when you as a citizen can be exploited for worse agendas ? 
  that to me is the real danger in cases like this . 
   on a less strategical note , i think giving up power to europe , in wich a citizen has hardly any influence is really bad for individual power . 
  hmm ... 
  i see where you 're going but at least from my little personal experience eu interventions are pretty damn amazing . 
  if i buy specific products with specific names i know * exactly * what i 'm getting and this will be the same across the eu .
