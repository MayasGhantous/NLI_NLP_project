  her having a fixed instance on issues is n't always her job . 
  sentiment in the german population shifted , including my own , and her politics reflected that over the course of the crisis . 
   germany was ** actively sabotaging border control ** by putting pressure on balkan countries not to close the borders . 
  citation needed . 
  ______  it 's easy for you , as a german , to say that you believe in more eu control given that you can count that germany will still have a disproportionate say over policy . 
  it 's not as easy to say that if you 're in budapest . 
   the eu is not a union of equals . 
  i can fully understand that . 
  the way i see it there are two ways of handling this . 
  a , individual policies of specific countries with completely voluntarily help from other countries if they ask for it . 
  b , a common policy that will be more influenced by e.g. 
  france or germany than by the greek or hungarians . 
  a does n't work . 
  we ** know ** it does n't work , because that 's the reason for this entire mess in the first place . 
  ______  the disaster of 2015 showed us that the eu could n't be trusted to the most basic of tasks for a sovereign entity : border control . 
  when it came down to it , the hungarians , croats and others had to do what the eu failed to do . 
  and they were being denounced as they secured their own borders . 
   now tell me , if you 're one of these smaller countries , why on earth would you believe a single word that these same people who denounced you as quasi-nazis and fascists yesterday are now saying today with regards to frontex ? 
  first , of course the eu failed when there is n't a common eu border agency . 
  countries did n't want to give up sovereignty and the result of that was that the eu was incapable of helping with issues rising at the borders - that 's why it fell upon individual countries to fix the resulting mess . 
  * that 's what overall countries decided on * , it 's hard to blame the eu for it . 
  as for the second point , quite simple : the idea of literally putting up a fence and refusing refugees entry is against [ basic eu values ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/en/charterpedia/article/18-right-asylum ) . 
  every member state signed up for that , everyone knew that this does n't say `` when people show up we close the border and call it a day '' . 
  now the value in place actually gets tested and individual countries decide : `` uhh ... fuck we did n't * really * like that value that much , we just signed it because uhh ... yeah . 
  fuck it , we do n't want these people in here . '', 
  i 'm totally fine with countries saying `` value x does n't work , we need to reform it '' , i 'm instantly on board with anyone who makes such a proposal because i fully agree . 
  but just acting like value x does n't exist all of a sudden during a crisis is completely unacceptable and anyone deserves to be denounced for that . 
   frontex is just a ferry service , though . 
  that 's because they have to work with our existing regulations for these issues . 
  you 're saying they need less resources because our regulations are bad , i 'm saying they need more resources and our regulations need to be adjusted . 
   that 's the reality , not something i particularly want to , i 'd rather see eu get its collective shit together and reform a core value to tackle the current situation . 
  then say so . 
  semantics and words are important , they 're the difference between us being on the same side and me assuming you 're being in the same pen as lepen ( ha ! ) . 
  politicians do n't just avoid reforms because the media says its bad , the media says its bad because the reforms proposed by extremists are against current laws and irresponsible . 
  that 's why if someone suggests ( like one afd politician did ) that we need our military to protect our borders you get crucified in the media but if you say `` we need to collectively deal with issues that arise , whether it 's refugees , borders or funding '' ( i 'm paraphrasing schulz ) it 's accepted . 
  the former makes news however , the latter does n't . 
  because that 's the accepted `` normal '' way of tackling such an issue and not openly defying existing values . 
   hungary , poland , slovakia and the czech republic is working together on our serbian border . 
  why is it different for italy and greece ? 
  because if , for whatever reason , a few million refugees show up at the serbian border and you have trouble handling it it would be an eu problem as well . 
  to me voluntary support is cool while it works but falls apart much too easily . 
  it 's not reliable in the long run because suddenly small political shifts can impact policies that were meant to be reliable . 
  if countries like germany , france or other majors would shift politically , opt-out of helping greece with their border and then use the refugee influx as justification to build up their own borders with eu countries that 'd be an issue as well . 
  suddenly austria for example would ** have ** to do the same and it just keeps going . 
   http://frontex.europa.eu/pressroom/hot-topics/joint-operation-triton-italy--ekkaes  will frontex 's press release on their official site do ? 
  or is that not official enough for you ? 
  your initial claim :  and i completely understand why countries are reluctant to invest more in the operation as it seems it often devolves into a migrant ferry service and not a force that 's stopping illegal immigration . 
  part of my response :  again , the laws that you quoted higher up are a different issue that also needs to be addressed . 
  i said if they currently * need * to do this that 's a ** legal ** issue which is different from them devolving `` into a migrant ferry service and not a force that 's stopping illegal immigration '' . 
  you 're taking them following a currently existing eu guideline and use that to justify that frontex is something bad to invest into . 
  i * specifically * said that both frontex needs to be strengthened ** and ** and the legal framework needs to be changed . 
  ___________  oh , so now , if i want any sort of core eu reform , i 'm suddenly anti-eu ? 
  oh piss off with that bullshit . 
  that is not what you said . 
  let me quote :  none of the politicians want to sign something ** where the media would paint them as responsible for the deaths of migrants ** trying to enter eu illegally [ ... ]  they should be deported without mercy that is not `` i want a sort of core eu reform '' that 's straight up against a core eu value . 
  as it stands politicians signing something like this ** are ** responsible for the deaths of people and they would be going against existing eu laws . 
  __________ it 's * one * thing to say `` i 'm for asylum laws being reformed because the current state does n't work out '' it 's a completely different thing to say `` our politicians are n't doing anything against it because our evil media might complain '' . 
  by framing the topic as if you want people to ** act ** against existing eu laws without addressing those first , how is that not trying to violate currently existing core values and hence anti-eu ? 
   frontex is a disaster . 
  its an agency with 400 employees and 250mil $ budget that 's supposed to be able to help every single member state in need . 
  of course it 's a disaster . 
  that 's precisely what i 'm arguing . 
  there is no way for the eu to build credibility with regards to border control if some members block any efforts to build a common border control . 
   you ca n't complain about poland and hungary on the one hand but leave out germany 's very liberal asylum policies on the other . 
  sure i can . 
  because `` germany 's very liberal asylum policies '' should be just as irrelevant as poland trying to ignore asylum seekers . 
  refugees did n't simply warp into germany , they came in via the european outer borders . 
  and once they 're in the eu they 're a european problem and * someone * has to take care of it , according to our laws and regulations . 
  a proper and well-regulated eu border is ** directly ** in german interest - that 's why germany/france are two of the majors pushing for a stronger frontex . 
  we have zero control over the outer eu borders but have to deal with the consequences nevertheless . 
  ________  if germany did n't have a very liberal regime , people would n't have come . 
  i , as a german citizen , am arguing for ** less ** influence of individual member states ( * including * germany ) when it comes to controlling the influx of non-eu citizens . 
  and you 're using the example of a member state supposedly having more influence than others as an argument against that . 
  do n't you see the hypocrisy in that ? 
  yeah pretty much . 
  thought that was implicit , it 's not like someone comes across the sea into italy and then warps to hungary before being an issue for italy . 
  i take that as a `` no '' . 
  because the whole point of a union is that if one country has an issue , especially an unprecedented one , the others help out . 
  by the same extent we could say `` how can the whole eu to be expected to help polish [ agriculture and development ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm#projects ) ? 
  why does helping poland need a whole eu solution ? '', 
   why ca n't italy or greece request the help of individual countries ? 
  they requested frontex . 
  frontex was n't able to deal with it ( partially because of poland and hungary blocking it becoming more powerful ) . 
  they requested additional help , some countries choose to help , voluntarily , some others ( like hungary ) did n't . 
  this entire process was uncoordinated as hell and took way too long because other eu members were forced to make individual , separate decisions . 
  that state is a complete disgrace from my perspective and should not be voluntarily . 
  _______ what 's the point of a formal and by definition rather tight union when members just pick and choose which parts they consider appropriate when an issue affects every single member ? 
   because the major european parties prefer to ignore that the vast majority of europeans do not support open borders with mena which major european parties support an open border eu policy ? 
  last time this discussion was brought up we found 2 swedish parties which added up to 13 % of the popular vote . 
  freedom of movement . 
  also if one country ends up suffering , all countries end up suffering . 
  is there more to that story than r/td and pizzagate memes ? 
  yes , of course . 
  why would n't it be ? 
   the simplest solution o_o we 'd have to reintroduce border controls within the eu to make that useful at all imo . 
   it is partly his business if he 's in an eea country correct , that 's why i 'm for the eu controlling its outer borders instead of leaving countries alone in the dirt with it and dealing with e.g. 
  refugees as an entity , not as individual countries . 
  every single non-eu citizen that enters the eu is the problem of every single country . 
  yet in some cases there is * both * talk about how terrible the eu is at dealing with these issues while * also * blocking progress that allows it to do so .
