  when it comes to more pressing matters the eu for example just recently stopped germany pushing even more money into our failed berlin airport . 
  politicians try to sell it as `` look at the eu telling us what to do with our money ! '', 
  - citizens ( who pushed the lawsuit in front of eu courts ) were pretty damn happy about it . 
  overall , on a large scale , if i 'm genuinely honest i can safely say the eu being the way it is made my life better than if it did n't exist . 
  more power or less power to the eu is a debate we should openly have but in this case le pen wants the eu we know to cease existing . 
   well trump pretty much ended up being the same anyway * dude . 
  * * public broadcasting and other educational content is defunded * environmental protections are being eroded * the press is under constant attack by the executive * the new healthcare bill managed to turn [ things like rape ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/twoxchromosomes/comments/697cve/rape_postpartum_depression_cesarean_sections_and/ ) into pre-existing conditions ( since a reported rape involves being treated with hiv meds you can now be counted as anyone who actually has hiv ) * planned parenthood ( which deals with [ much more ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/twoxchromosomes/comments/69chbc/if_i_see_another_girl_on_my_news_feed_bash/ ) than abortion issues ) is effectively defunded . 
  * name two countries that get along better with the us now than before . 
  one would be way too easy . 
  and that 's just the stuff that came to mind within a minute or so . 
  a lot of people are wishing that ` more of the same ' over there would have happened instead . 
  eh , france * does * have pretty substantial powers for the president in the case of emergencies , something germany for example specifically got rid of to that extent because of the abuse potential . 
  it 's very hard to predict the damage someone who does n't play by the rules can do to a system or the flaws they can find to make it work for them . 
   well , we had a discussion a few days ago and he told me that he despises le pen with every vein in his body , but at the same time macron means kind of status-quo and an economic neo-liberal agenda which he absolut does n't want to support . 
  i can understand that idea , it just pretty much boils down to the video linked above . 
  when one choice is status-quo and an economic policy i 'm not into and the other represents a fascist voter base then the latter candidate coming through could mean you 're not getting another chance to vote if worst cases happen . 
  honestly i like your system overall , especially the blackouts and rules on campaigning are something we could learn from . 
  i think the only thing you 'd need to change up is multiple votes in the second round in case your first choice becomes not a part of the final two . 
  if you 'd vote hamon -  m\u00e9lenchon then you 're stuck in a really dumb spot . 
  discard the lowest candidate , distribute the 2nd vote among the remaining ones , repeat . 
  hell , why not make it three in order ? 
  yeah , i can definitely appreciate and respect the strategic aspect . 
  i also think that 's an incredibly dangerous game to play however . 
  fascists define themselves by not playing by the rules . 
  they do things like build on a racist and xenophobe base and then present themselves as a neutral alternative - `` choisir la france ! '', 
  and all that . 
  they pander for the workers vote by hiding nationalist intent behind socialist agendas . 
  obvious historical comparisons to hitler only getting 33 % of the popular vote aside - i fully agree with you . 
  what you 're describing is what * should * happen if she gets elected in a strong democracy like france . 
  trumps muslim ban was blocked too . 
  but then public broadcasting is defunded , planned parenthood is defunded and americans can kiss environmental protections goodbye . 
  relationships with other countries have been massively damaged and we 're only months in . 
  we still do n't know how continuous attacks on the press will go in the long run , how the courts will be influenced and how dozens of other things will end up developing . 
  in a nutshell , i really , really hope that your vision of what would happen is the one that will become a reality if le pen does end up winning . 
  but i also think that 's a too dangerous game to play with people who do n't have the same respect for democracy and individual rights as you or me . 
  if those people get power , they * will * use every last inch you give them . 
  first they came for the socialists . 
   on other hand , voting against someone is not what democracy is for . 
  democracy is also about accepting the best possible compromise for our own ideals . 
  if one candidate is someone we really do n't like but the other represents fascist ideas then i think yes , i do blame those people for abstaining . 
  first they came for the socialists . 
   my french buddy said he would have voted for macron if the election was close , since this is not the case he will vote `` white '' . 
  i heard that from a few french friends as well and i think that 's a dangerous idea . 
  on one hand it means that you fully accept the results no matter the outcome , it does n't absolve you from your responsibility of it . 
  on the other hand the assembl\u00e9e nationale election is the time to show who you * actually * want to represent you ( and potentially even oppose the winner when push comes to shove ) - now is the time to vote for who you perceive to be the better compromise for your own personal values . 
  out of curiosity : if i was french and undecided at this point , how would you try to convince me to vote for le pen ? 
  why do * you * believe she is the best possible option in general or at this point specifically ? 
  out of a complete inability to understand the logic behind it : why do you intend on voting for the candidate that most right-wing extremist in france feel like represents their best interest ? 
  _________ & nbsp ; edit : the guy i replied to ( who actually gave good answers ) deleted his replies in here , presumably because people ended up being dickheads despite him being super polite about the whole thing . 
  if anyone is curious the gist of his argument was ( similar to [ this post here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69qewe/dear_french_friends_please_go_out_and_vote_even/dh8n99h/ ) ) that if le pen wins now then she will fail and the fn as we know it will cease to exist and the political environment can reform . 
  also he fully expected le pen to not be able to do anything radical due to the upcoming parliamentary election most likely not backing her up . 
  my own reply to that argument can be found [ further below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69qewe/dear_french_friends_please_go_out_and_vote_even/dh8lsxk/ ) . 
  there is overall some good discussion in these chains though , but you 'll have to follow the trail of deleted posts . 
  [ this here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69qewe/dear_french_friends_please_go_out_and_vote_even/dh8lj3v/ ) is another chain that had some decent replies to the same basic argument from some other people . 
  yeah , for me personally i knew about people being expelled from former prussia or eastern europe in general but german diaspora in the balkans that was expelled was new to me . 
  it 's okay though , we 're conquering at least croatia back with beach towels and tourist money nowadays . 
  i think that 's a bit of a cynic way too see it . 
  sure , things like this likely do n't come * exclusively * becomes someone wanted to do a nice or `` the right '' thing but if it spreads awareness , takes responsibility and aims to prevent similar bullshit in the future it 's overall a positive thing . 
  i personally did n't either . 
  feels a bit weird to learn about it this way , it 's definitely a really cool gesture . 
  fake news .

  you do n't need a single word of knowledge about french to see the madness . 
  or humor . 
  i 'm hoping it 's meant to be humor . 
  e : did someone really make this crap up , post it over [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/69mr1a/macron_conspiring_with_illuminatis_confirmes/ ) at t_d and got massive upvotes ? 
  i 'm so confused . 
   do n't all systems come down to a two-party system at the end of the day ? 
  lol that 's just game theory dude . 
  the us is the exception when we 're talking about western democracies here , not the rule . 
  if it 's `` lol just game theory dude '' then why are most democracies ** not ** two party states ? 
   i mean , what 's the difference between a american party & a european coalition ? 
  that they 're the result of people voting for specific things . 
  coalitions mean that you ca n't for example tell your voters that other parties are the devil because you * still * have to work together to form a government . 
  it allows someone who wants to vote for an environmental party to be just as represented as someone who wants to vote for a comparatively vague idea of `` center-right '' or `` center-left '' . 
  a two party system can never offer the individual voter as much representation as a multi-party system since he 's * already * voting for one large consensus of one of two opposing blocks . 
   i mean , for somebody who seems so informed about american politics , has the array of different factions in each party & flare-ups of ideological in-fighting not caught your attention ? 
  sure and we got the same in our parties . 
  various ideologies come out on top and * then * the voters decide which of those groups they want to represent them . 
   not to mention , unlike germany , there is a very clear seperation of powers here . 
  there is no executive chacellor put in power by congress with all the party politics to underpin her authority & to force legislation through . 
  uh . . what are you talking about exactly ? 
  the german chancellor is decided upon by the parties who are able to form a majority government . 
  every voter is represented and * some * groups need to be able to align to group up in a majority . 
  how 's majority consensus over the executive a bad thing ? 
  that 's what democracy is about . 
   and hypothetically , would n't a german judge be more vunerable to corruption & being partial if he wanted to work in the public or private sector past 52 or did n't want to retire at 68 ? 
  again i 'm not saying our variant is straight up * better * than the american one . 
  i 'm saying that there are dozens of reasonable ways to do this but you presenting it as if lifetime appointment is the holy grail is just incredibly arrogant and dishonest without actual evidence to back it up . 
   and does n't that system you described undermine much of the checks & balances the supreme court here holds over ths executive & legislative too ? 
  how come ? 
  the idea is that if 2/3rds in multiple houses ( across multiple parties ) can agree on a candidate it pretty much guarantees him being someone who does his job - and does n't represent the interests of just one party . 
   you can shit on america all you want dude , but this system has held strong , survived & been continously tested for centuries , from a small coastal republic to a continent-spanning superpower , from economic depressions to social transformations . 
  how is pointing out a clear issue `` shitting on america '' ? 
  fact is that it boils down to random chance ( date of death ) which political group in the us is able to influence the judiciary and hence interpretation of the law for decades . 
  if the president and a simple majority in the senate have common interests then there is potential for abuse because they hold the legitimate powers to force this through . 
  it 's also important to note that the way the us works right now was not foreseen by the founders themselves . 
  hell , it 's pretty obvious from just [ commentaries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_college_ ( united_states \\ ) #history ) that parties were n't even intended to be part of the equation .
