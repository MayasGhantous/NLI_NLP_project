  the idea was that if individual electors vote their conscience then there will be be multiple candidates in the race and then congress picks one of the top 3 as president . 
  suddenly e.g. 
  the way a scotus judge is appointing makes sense for example since now it 's assumed that the senate and the president want to keep each other in check . 
  here 's how the us works right now : * a * simple majority * in the us senate + consent of the president is enough to appoint anyone ( note there is no qualification requirement either ) as a scotus judge for life . 
  * this means that ( since the us is effectively a two party state since quite some time now ) every single time the senate has the same majority as whoever has the presidency there is potential for abuse . 
  you do not see * any * issue with this ? 
  it 's not about whether abuse is likely , it 's not about what people actually do , it 's about a clear and rather obvious `` questionable '' part of the system that 's completely legitimate . 
  ______ in straight up comparison with the german system for example for our constitutional court we have one single 12 year term , an age limit of 68 , an age minimum of 40 , people have to be professional judges , eligible for election to parliament and not be member of any other parliamentary institution . 
  they need a 2/3rd majority in both chambers and we 're talking about a system where even a simple majority that one party holds by themselves is an absolute rarity even in just one chamber . 
  hence co-operation between political groups is necessary to get someone elected as a judge which directly affects how partisan the issue is . 
  and on top of it all we 're not talking about a court that can review * any * case and set a precedence but exclusively springs into action when someone sues because in his opinion a law , other case or anything similar went against the constitution . 
  none of the judges have any influence on ` regular ' cases that do n't involve a constitutional discussion . 
  _______  i 've seen no better defense against judicial corruption & no better incentive for judicial impartiality than a life appointment . 
  how can you * objectively * say that the us system is here straight up better than e.g. 
  one term of 12 years ? 
  why does a life appointment make people more impartial and more resistant against corruption ? 
  it 's just one of probably dozens of ways to do this kind of thing . 
   an i ca n't really think of a better check & balance for judicial appointment than having one branch appoint them & another branch approve them when there are only 3 branches . 
  what i 'm criticizing about the us variant is n't that one branch appoints and another approves - if you scroll up germany for example specifically excludes its executive in this process . 
  what i 'm criticizing is that it 's about a * simple majority * ( nuclear option ) in a * two party system * ( this one here is pretty much ensured by the electoral college ) that results in an appointment to the highest possible court position for any case in the us * for life * . 
  and those things in combination are where the abuse potential comes from . 
  all that needs to happen is judges dying and 50 % of the senate & the president agreeing on candidates that do n't even have to be judges . 
  ___ e : thinking about this some more this would n't be an issue if the us had multiple parties at all . 
  then the senate would * have * to agree and find a consensus whenever someone has less than 50 % majority there . 
  as long as there are only two parties however there is no real ` check ' here since we can safely assume the interests of the president and that of a simple majority in the senate will align more often than not . 
  as it stands the current process just seems to not be designed with a two-party state in mind at all and that 's why it even looks like something highly questionable in the first place . 
  ... and if for some reason multiple judges die during the same term then one president and one party get to dictate how the judiciary is going to interpret law for decades ? 
  that 's pretty much why people mention `` questionable '' or `` random '' in this regard . 
  i 'd rather we contain that guy somewhere where his comments do n't get translated into english , or even worse [ him translating them himself ] ( https://youtu.be/8bgkfvbg9sm?t=26 ) . 
  or chinese . 
  oh god . 
  please no . 
  i would want to say that at least we 're not sending [ seehofer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horst_seehofer#european_integration ) to the eu but then we * did * do that with [ stoiber ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edmund_stoiber#controversies ) already ... 
  i think the real solution to this is clearly ~ ~ frankish ~ ~ franconian independence . 
  i could get behind that kinda fraxit . 
  e : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rreq8ovw-q ) is the above speech with subtitles . 
   europe is actually the only part of the world that declined in share on total population . 
  americas , africa and asia all grew in last century much quicker than europe . 
  that 's because europe was leading the charge when it came to medical advancements . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2696 ) is a graphical representation of income/average lifespan ( which correlates with population growth ) across 200 + nations since 1800 . 
  yellow = europe/russia , red = asia , blue = africa , green = americas . 
  ______ the trick is that more than 2 kids are unsustainable everywhere in the world , across cultures and religions . 
  populations explode when people have more kids than that * because they 're used to most of them dying * while medicine advances quicker than the population growth rate can adjust to it . 
  if 4 out of 6 kids do n't reach adulthood then it makes sense to have 6 kids per family . 
  once a generation of 6/6 kids grows up to become parents they themselves start having ~ 2 . 
  that 's * exactly * the same as what happened in europe happening all over the world , just with a delay for obvious reasons . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2696 ) is a graphical representation of income/average lifespan ( which correlates with population growth ) all across the world since 1800 . 
  the world wars are pretty nuts to see from that perspective . 
  yellow = europe/russia , red = asia , blue = africa , green = americas . 
  the main reason why european birthrates declined much sooner than in the rest of the world is because european medical advancements were leading the charge when it came to allowing kids to reach adulthood on a regular basis . 
  once this becomes established nations start gravitating towards 2 kids per family slowing down population growth in the process . 
  that 's why countries like brazil , bangladesh or vietnam are around or below fertility rates of ~ 2.5 nowadays . 
   no sign of it . 
  you mean just like there was no sign for western nations , brazil , vietnam or bangladesh approaching 2 children per family ? 
  unless africa is a complete exception for reasons yet unknown it will develop like any other area on earth : once children start surviving to adulthood on a regular basis people start having less kids . 
   what changed was that there is much less disastrous poverty in africa than even just 30 years ago , so children are actually a lot more likely to survive , but fertility has n't adjusted downwards to compensate . 
  that 's because it lags behind by a generation just like in any other country . 
  from the us to germany , from brazil to vietnam to bangladesh - everyone went closer to 2 kids per family once kids started surviving to adulthood . 
  basically all we need to do is send them less clothes and work on them being able to help themselves to get better education , infrastructure and medical treatments . 
   also , they probably still have native cultural beliefs valuing large families . 
  * everyone * has those beliefs when most kids die . 
  just like population growth slowed down in the west once this stopped happening it 's stopping in other countries all across the globe once this happens . 
  bangladesh , vietnam , brazil - all countries that approached 2 kids per family not too long ago . 
  africa is just still behind them in terms of development . 
  once the countries here get on the same level their population growth will slow down . 
  you 're spot on and this is exactly what 's happening . 
  i linked [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/fack2knc08e ) documentary further up , the gist is that all across the world from europe to vietnam to bangladesh ` peak child ' seems to revolve around 2 children per family . 
  once medical advancements push far enough that people survive into adulthood people start having less kids all across the globe , across religions and cultures . 
  it 's when you 're used to 4/6 kids dying with that not actually happening because of too quick advancements that massive population growth occurs . 
  [ `` how many babies do women have on average in bangladesh ? 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=697 ) is pretty much * the * question that sums our misunderstanding of the situation up rather easily . 
  most people would get that answer wrong because of our own personal misconceptions that clash with reality . 
   also sanitation and basic medicine . 
  80 % not dying before the age of 5 definitely helped . 
  it 's important to note though that these very same factors are also responsible for * stopping * the population explosion past a certain point . 
  the gist based on the data available seems to be that 2 children that survive and make it to adulthood can be considered `` peak child '' all across the world . 
  population explosions occur during the time when families still have more kids than that because they 're quite literally used to them dying off . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1162 ) is a graphical demonstration from a hans rosling talk , the entire thing is well worth a watch if you have some extra time . 
  he also makes fun of [ swedes , brits and educated brits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=697 ) by asking questions such as `` how many babies do women have on average in bangladesh ? '', 
  so it 's pretty much win-win . 
  another win occurs when we compare our own `` educated '' answers to chimpanzees . 
   also , i would argue that the usa 's system of checks and balances work ( e.g. 
  trumps travel ban order being shut down by the judiciary ) . 
  i think that needs to be seen more with a bit more differentiation . 
  if the judiciary can block an order that 's deemed unlawful to me that is n't a blank `` their system of checks and balances work '' but `` the basics work and it 's a functioning state '' . 
  that kind of thing happening is the absolute bare minimum and not a sign of a great system . 
  the idea of the president and his party being able to directly affect the judiciary like in the us is a bit questionable overall to say the least . 
  coming from a german perspective where our [ laws ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_emergency_acts#contents_of_the_law ) for these cases obviously exist but are very specifically limited i think it 's important that even emergency powers are carefully framed and have limitations . 
  here for example the case you 're describing ( foreign invasion ) is not part of some generic 'em ergency ' but a [ specific case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_defence_ ( germany \\ ) ) with again specific limitations . 
  the idea is that yes , these things are needed for emergencies but there also need to be failsafes for the case that someone in power tries to abuse them . 
  that 's also why for example the german chancellor or any other individual ca n't even declare those cases ( we obviously have other solutions in case leadership is incapable of making such decisions ) but needs the backing of multiple chambers to do so . 
  again * unless * it 's an emergency emergency ( aka literally troops at your doorsteps ) where exceptions apply . 
  _____ as usual you need to balance checks and balances ( ha ! ), 
  with enabling the government and society as a whole to act as one solid unit . 
  from that perspective i think that pretty much unrestricted emergency powers are a really , really bad idea in general . 
  thinking about this more - cases like foreign invasions do n't worry me at all because as history has shown time and time again they 're scenarios where countries are able to strongly react because every member of society shares the same interest : protecting their nation . 
  i 'd argue that it 's more likely that rather unlimited powers in a state of emergency are abused to push a nation away from democracy than that ( reasonable ) limitations on these powers are to prevent the proper and necessary reactions to keep the citizens safe . 
   sadly the biggest part of turks in germany is very conservative and pro erdogan . 
  just chiming in here because while * technically * correct ( if you 're using `` turks '' as `` turkish citizens '' here ) it 's not the full story . 
  all the following statements are true : * 63 % of turks in germany voted `` yes '' in the referendum * 30 % of the turks who were allowed to vote voted `` yes '' * 13 % of all turkish-germans voted `` yes '' the trick is that we have 3.5 + million * ethnically * turkish people ( `` german turks '' / `` turkish germans '' / '' [ turks in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_germany ) '' ) living in germany , 1.5 million of those have turkish citizenship .
