  50 % participated in the vote for the referendum with ~ 450000 voting `` yes '' . 
  * most * people use `` turkish citizen '' , `` ethnically turkish '' and `` turk '' interchangeably so i think it 's important to clarify in this case . 
  no , just your average td regular . 
   at the same time we have a media outlet that is literally and actually controlled by the government man , i typed up a brilliant comment about how german public broadcasting is specifically set up to * not * allow governmental control with multiple failsafes ( compared to e.g. 
  pbs being defundable in the us with just a budgetary decision ) and then i realized we 're talking about dw which is the exception to the rule and literally the only public broadcaster that is financed via taxes directly and direct under federal control . 
   marion marechal-le pen , a niece of ms. 
  le pen , posted the piece on twitter before quickly removing the link after local media outlets debunked the claim . 
  i 'm surprised there is in general so few info about her floating around at the moment . 
  she was the one who tweeted at steve bannon that she 'll gladly meet him in his capacity as a [ cambridge analytica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_analytica ) boardmember a while back [ [ german source ] ( https://www.dasmagazin.ch/2016/12/03/ich-habe-nur-gezeigt-dass-es-die-bombe-gibt/ ) with more info ] . 
  [ here ] ( https://twitter.com/marion_m_le_pen/status/797489987583438852?lang=en ) is a link to her tweet from november 2016 . 
  it also works pretty well as a distraction from people like [ robert mercer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_mercer_ ( businessman \\ ) ) and their [ various ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/make_america_number_1 ) pet [ projects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_analytica ) . 
    because saying `` turkish minorities in germany voted for erdogan '' is extremely misleading if you 're trying to use it as an example of integration . 
   i 'm sorry , i was n't trying to be misleading , i genuinely was n't aware of the low participation level . 
  thank you for clarifying that . 
  just to elaborate on this i 'm not trying to absolve them ( those eligible to vote ) either . 
  50 % participation is atrocious ( even if there are lot of * good * reasons to not participate here ) . 
  but what i 'm getting at is citing the 63 % figure judges 3.5 million people by the actions of 400k or even if you want to blame all non-voters too by the actions of ~ 1.3 million . 
  most examples of good integration ( but who the average person will still see as `` turkish '' ) simply were n't even able to vote . 
   yes , to be precise , the main concern for the czech public is islam , not the colour of the skin of the people . 
  good , that 's * my * main problem as well . 
  but now we still need to differentiate between those who integrate well and those who do n't at all . 
  same basic concept should apply here : we * need * to be intolerant against those who preach against tolerance . 
  right now , as it stands , germany is n't a great example there either . 
  i 'm positive there in the longer run however since we 're * probably * one of the few states pretty much designed to deal with this exact thing . 
   however that does n't mean that czech authorities responsible for handling asylum cases discriminate againts muslims . 
  that 's not what is happening here . 
  those muslim people who manage to apply for asylum in the czech republic and who do qualify for it are given asylum ( or subsidiary protection ) just like any other applicants . 
  how do you reconcile `` 80 % of us do n't want any mena refugees '' with `` those who apply via regular channels are treated fairly '' ? 
  =p  but i do n't think you 'd be interested in that . 
  it 's easier to judge people as ` xenophobic ' and ` bigoted ' without trying to understand their point of view . 
  i am actually , why else would i still be replying ? 
  as for judging , of course i do . 
  saying `` i do n't want this person near me because of his religion '' ( as long as there 's nothing else that person has done against society ) * is * bigoted . 
  it * is * disrespectful on a fundamental human level . 
  there 's a reason we ( in this case the eu again ) put it in the same category as sex , race , colour of skin and all those other things . 
  * however * , i 'm also aware that this most likely is n't the result of some inherent xenophobia-gene that people ca n't get rid of , but merely a reflection of experiences , perceptions and information . 
  the reason why i 'm still so insistent about this ( and also why i 'm quite frankly really damn triggered about you being so nonchalant about it ) is because the baseline ** has ** to be that it 's generally a bad thing . 
  over here our almost literal [ nazi-party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democratic_party_of_germany#election_results_and_current_representation ) got < 2 % in elections for decades now . 
  our current `` alt-right '' equivalent that cozies up to le pen , orban , trump and all the others is sitting at ~ 10 % with their highest polls being around 13 % . 
  it 's a very safe bet that * easily * 4/5ths of people who vote for tht party are n't people who used to vote extreme-right so far in their lifetime . 
  the difference between those people and the remaining fifth is that i have no issue believing them that they have completely valid concerns that go way past `` rawr racists !, 
  ! 1 '' , do n't feel those concerns are addressed and are now flocking to the largest banner that says : `` i got a solution !!! '', 
  here , let me quote an example from early in the discussion :  do your best to prevent the migrants and refugees from coming . 
  and yes , i mean including fences and walls . 
   keep those who still come irregularely in camps to send a message that anyone who comes illegaly will not enjoy the life in rich we countries that he/she seeks . 
  when you make statements like that , you 're putting yourself into an extremist category . 
  when someone on our right-wing says `` build a wall and prevent them from coming '' they mean `` build a wall , stop all refugees and let them rot wherever '' . 
  when you say `` keep them in camps * to send a message * '' what someone like me understands is `` they should * suffer * in those camps to send a message ( because they 're worth less anyway ) '' . 
  when your message is that `` they will not enjoy the life in rich we countries that he/she seeks '' then you 're actively undermining any legitimate reason to become a refugee . 
  `` hence every single one of them is an economic migrant and we can deport them straight up . 
  ____ the pretty much only reason for me to even continue the discussion past that point is that not * all * of your replies sound like that . 
  but you also need to be aware how much of a dick you sound like when you say these things . 
  * `` we need walls and fences ( we eventually maybe even have to close them off completely ) but that does n't mean we ca n't take refugees when we 're strong enough to do so . '', 
  * `` i understand it 's bad to discriminate based on religion but i still feel uneasy around muslims . '', 
  * `` i do n't want people in need to suffer if we can prevent it , but i also do n't want people who do n't need help to be able scam themselves into it . '', 
  all of the above , i 'd have no issue going into them . 
  but if your baseline is `` fuck them , i do n't want any mena/muslim immigrants , period . '', 
  then this is n't about opposing views or understanding anymore , it 'd be about you being an extremist with any further attempt at understanding being pointless . 
  there would n't be any . 
  if you * can * drop that kind of rhetoric and understand why i consider it unacceptable then i 'd gladly learn more about backgrounds . 
  hell , you might even learn that we pretty much want the exact same thing . 
  tends to happen with humans once you really break it down . 
   i 'm sorry , but i do n't understand how you mean this . 
  you seem to make a distinction between people with turkish citizenship and people of turkish descent , but if the second groups does n't have turkish citizenship , how were they allowed to vote ? 
  because saying `` turkish minorities in germany voted for erdogan '' is extremely misleading if you 're trying to use it as an example of integration . 
  there are officially 3.5 + million people of turkish descent living in germany ( we do n't differentiate past 3rd generation as well ) . 
  1.5 million with turkish citizenship . 
  400000 voted for erdogans referendum . 
  so * despite * the 63 % number floating around a minority of the people who were able to vote voted in favor and a ** massive ** minority of people with at least one turkish parent voted in favor . 
  german integration overall cares comparatively little about first gen but most of the focus is on 2nd and 3rd gen immigrants . 
  basically , those numbers say nothing with regards to how well turks integrate or do n't integrate . 
  even 50 % not voting does n't tell us much because we do n't have data as for why they did n't participate . 
   as for the geneva convention from 1951 and the protocol from 1967 - these both only oblige us to grant refugee status to those who are eligible and who can reach our country to apply for it here . 
  it does n't say anything about accepting refugees from other safe countries . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , the refugees are not interested in coming to the czech republic anyway . 
  so we 're not breaking these two treaties . 
  ____  so we 're not breaking these two treaties . 
  let me quote you yourself :  you have it the other way around , at least in the case of the czech republic - the public sentiment is overwhelmingly against taking mena refugees , therefore politicians just ca n't accept refugee quotas , that 's as if a german politician proposed to stop austerity and make more big financial transfers to the south . 
   it just is n't politically possible here . 
  the eu is pushing somewhere where we just ca n't take a step back and as a result , it 's stirring anti-eu sentiments on its own . 
  it does n't even need our politicians helping with that . 
  you 're openly advocating in favor of discriminating people based on their origin . 
  ** that ** is your primary reason for not wanting to share the load once refugees are within eu borders . 
  that 's not just xenophobic and bigoted as fuck - it 's also straight up against the charter of fundamental rights of the eu . 
  and * that * is why there is outrage about blanket bans . 
  almost no one reasonable has an issue with concerns . 
  screening , controls , deporting those who do n't fit into society . 
  it 's the complete and utter refusal based on xenophobic and racist attitudes that people have an issue with . 
  again , it 's exactly that attitude that other countries , germany leading the charge , had to fight against to get cee countries into the eu . 
  because all those stupid things were said about people like you . 
  not because you 're evil , your culture is terrible or because you ever did anything mean or harmful to anyone - but because of where you 're from , what you look like and what your accent sounds like in other languages . 
  i ca n't speak for germany , german politics or even germans in general . 
  but for me , personally , i 'd rather see xenophobic attitudes like that go their own way - and not in a union that aims to bring cultures together from finland to greece and to portugal . 
  like , seriously . 
  if you or anyone you care about wants to move to germany , sweden or france do you want people to say : `` fuck off economic migrant , get back to your country '' ? 
  i 'm part of the group who gladly tell anyone to piss off who starts that kind of pointless crap . 
  but for people to keep standing up for that * you * need to learn to stand up for this as well . 
   i was n't really pushing anything , but fine , if you want to go there - it 's a not just some deluded feeling that many people from mena countries have not integrated very well in we . 
  turkish minorities in germany , netherlands or belgium vote for erdogan , so please , tell me more about how they accepted european values , because erdogan for sure is such a champion of european values . 
  63 % of the people with turkish citizenship living in germany voted for erdogan ( with 50 % of them not participating in the election ) .
