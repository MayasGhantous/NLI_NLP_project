  ** 13 % of people of turkish decent living in germany voted for erdogan . 
  ** both of these statements are true . 
  * that * is how well integrated the majority of them are . 
   now , obviously i 'm not saying that everyone from afghanistan is unintegratable in germany . 
  or that every czech person will just smoothly fit in . 
  i 'm just saying that on average , people in the czech republic are closer to germans than people from afghanistan . 
  that statement is totally fine . 
  and * because * of that we need to judge people based on their character and not their color of skin or background . 
  people here who are n't on the extreme right fought for in some cases * decades * that people with right-extremist views stop treating eastern europeans as subhuman trash . 
  the same is true for turks . 
  now i can find people with - g\u00fcr - im or - ski - vic at the ends of their name in germany universities . 
  as professors for german . 
  or medicine . 
  some with a bit darker skin , some a bit lighter . 
  who cares . 
   they may even have the intention to fully integrate , but they simply do n't manage it . 
  the rent prices drive them to poor neighbourhoods with already strong immigrant communities and this makes integration harder . 
  some people are simply not smart enough to learn a foreign language well at an adult age . 
  some people just ca n't cope with all the trauma they 've been through , some just ca n't get used to a completely different culture , even if they really wanted to . 
  and that 's fine : those who become criminal because of those conditions can ( and should be ) sent back . 
  those who can make it should be kept . 
  again blanket bans do nothing besides serving xenophobic superiority complexes . 
   as i said , the prospects of the middle east and africa are really bad . 
  it could be that in the future , there will be migration waves not of thousands of people , or hundreds of thousands of people , but of millions . 
  at that point , the international treaties will go out of the window . 
  look , now you 're arguing hypothetical doom and gloom scenarios in the future . 
  sure that needs to be considered but the trick is this : at that point the czech republic is fucked if the polar opposite of german space nazis allows millions into their country . 
  a common , reasonable policy right now that * regulates influx * can be common ground to later regulate it more or less harsh - depending on the conditions . 
   the refugee convention of 1951 was created with the emerging cold war and its primary goal was to deal with political prisoners and other persecuted people in the eastern bloc . 
  you can read it to see that there is n't even any mention of `` war '' in the convention . 
  it was n't build for situations like this . 
  alright . 
  then have your representatives advocate to get out of that kind of convention . 
  ** right now ** your , mine and most countries on the planet agreed on it . 
   there ca n't be a union if some countries are forcing other countries to go directly against the wishes of their people . 
  these countries all agreed to [ fundamental basics ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a12012p%2ftxt ) . 
   the right to asylum shall be guaranteed with due respect for the rules of the geneva convention of 28 july 1951 and the protocol of 31 january 1967 relating to the status of refugees and in accordance with the treaty on european union and the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( hereinafter referred to as ` the treaties ' ) . 
  ...  any discrimination based on any ground such as sex , race , colour , ethnic or social origin , genetic features , language , religion or belief , political or any other opinion , membership of a national minority , property , birth , disability , age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited . 
  when the v4 joined the eu in 2004 they agreed to uphold those rights , laws and values . 
  that 's what some countries are `` trying to force on other countries '' . 
  not more , not less . 
   what about those ukrainian refugees ? 
  are their refugee status worth less than those from middle east ? 
  no , but when you exclude one nationality and welcome another you 're discriminating based on nationality . 
  something [ all eu member states ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a12012p%2ftxt ) agreed to not do . 
   in my opinion the way migration crisis in 2015 was handled is the main reason why poland says no to everything now . 
  if someones solution to `` this shit is n't working out '' is saying no to everything then that 's not a solution either : that 's blocking solutions . 
   on the other hand all reasonable solutions would be labeled as racist , so it 's a lost case . 
  ... no , ` solutions ' like `` why do n't we build a wall and leave them out '' or `` why do n't we build a cheap camp somewhere else/on an island '' are labeled as racist . 
   so he 's openly campaigning for `` let 's send more money to greece '' ? 
  openly for `` let 's stop austerity '' so far . 
   do your best to prevent the migrants and refugees from coming . 
  and yes , i mean including fences and walls . 
  if necessary , crack down on the ngos who are running boat-taxis just a few miles from libyan shores . 
  nope . 
  the scenario was specifically `` they 're in greece and greece is asking the eu for help '' . 
  if you mean `` fences and walls '' aka letting people rot on the other side of them that 's against fundamental human rights and the [ right to asylum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_asylum ) . 
  by joining the eu all countries , including the v4 and their populations , agreed to uphold these standards . 
   keep those who still come irregularely in camps to send a message that anyone who comes illegaly will not enjoy the life in rich we countries that he/she seeks . 
  the rich life they seek ? 
  what about , you know , a life in a non-war torn country ? 
   because even german and swedish public will eventually lose their humanitarian wishful thinking once they 're confronted with the reality . 
  the reality is that a minority of them are responsible for the vast , vast majority of crime committed . 
  60 % of the violent crime committed by all refugees in germany is against other refugees , mostly because they 're living in cramped conditions . 
  if security is your concern , there you go . 
  again , i 'm all for deporting those who do n't show any intent of integrating in any european society . 
  as a sidenote , specifically refugees from syria are bringing the average crime committed by foreigners * down * in germany , not up . 
  our primary concern are people from maghreb and from balkan states when it comes to bringing the average up . 
  _________ what tilts me like no end here is the hypocrisy , because all those arguments are something i , as a german , heard before : * they steal our cars and violate our women . 
  * they commit more crime than native germans . 
  * they have no respect for our culture . 
  * they do n't want to integrate and live in their own ghettos . 
  * they do n't even want to learn how to speak proper german . 
  all of the above was the exact same racist , xenophobic bullshit . 
  want to know who it was towards ? 
  eastern europeans . 
  people like you . 
  brexit was a success in parts due to people wanting polish people out of their country . 
  hell , even in schools i 've seen turkish germans bullied by serbian germans and polish germans - because they 're the ones who got bullied for being foreigners when the turkish guy was n't around . 
  and now * you * are pushing the exact same narrative . 
  because people look different , are from different cultures and speak different languages . 
  guess what : so do you . 
  and so does every single human being on this planet if he leaves the place he was born in for whatever reason . 
  and this is where you 'll go `` ah , no , ** we ** are different from ** those ** guys , of course ** we ** would integrate eventually !, 
  - but * those * guys , no , * those guys * do n't deserve the same chance as we do . '', 
  ______ the line gets drawn at the * actions of the individual * . 
  not their nationality , not their color of skin , not their language , not their culture and not their religion . 
  what you 're advocating ** directly ** goes against [ the fundamental rights of the eu ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a12012p%2ftxt ) . 
  if countries suddenly realize what documents they agreed to and are incapable of proposing solutions to issues that do n't conflict with basic values and laws then there 's nothing more to add . 
  no one was * forced * to agree to this . 
  yet all eu members did . 
  there ca n't be a union if nations and their citizens are refusing to stick to what they agreed upon . 
   again , when it comes to migration , we 're opposing germany 's policy just as much as hungary and poland , we 're simply a bit more diplomatic about it and we have not picked other fights with the commission , like poland and hungary did , so you just do n't hear about us that much . 
  hmm ... til . 
   that 's as if a german politician proposed to stop austerity and make more big financial transfers to the south . 
  that 's * exactly * what martin schulz ( the chancellor candidate of the center-left ) is proposing because he considers it too neoliberal and , while maybe appropriate in the past , not beneficiary anymore . 
  his party is polling ~ 30 % , if you combine that with our other ( much more radical ) left party we 're looking at ~ 40 % support as of now . 
  this whole austerity thing is more a product of our current minister of finance and the center-right in general , not something uniquely german . 
  - but i do get what you 're trying to say . 
    again we 're in a spot where i consider opt-outs of something like distribution of refugees extremely dangerous to the union as a whole - more dangerous than the threat of some countries leaving because of this .
