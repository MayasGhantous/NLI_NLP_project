   i do n't agree with this at all . 
  the refugee quotas are a silly measure anyway , it 's not gon na help solving anything , so risking more countries leaving because of it would be pretty stupid . 
  from my view a * blanket ban * is straight up worse than quotas because it isolates member states with issues . 
  i 'm all for proper screening ( germany 's approach was atrocious ) , strict deportations of serial criminals and eu wide regulations to avoid them getting back in again . 
  but not a * blanket ban based on nationality * . 
  * unless * you manage to change [ un treaties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) that support this stance that 's just straight up unacceptable ( * especially * for pro-eu candidates in germany and france ) because of the following . 
  hypothetical scenario : mena refugees are trying to enter greece . 
  based on the above conventions greece ca n't straight up deny them entry unless for reasons of national security . 
  greece ends up with more mena refugees than they can handle and asks the eu for help . 
  what response do you want to see ? 
  which solution do you consider better than quotas for all member states ? 
  the core issue here is that if you make it opt-out ( or opt-in for that matter ) greek * could * be completely isolated with this problem . 
   the contracting states shall not  discriminate against refugees ( article 3 )  ** take exceptional measures against a refugee solely on account of his or her nationality ( article 8 ) **, 
  hmmm ... that 's fair enough when you consider the v4 countries as one block with shared interests . 
  i think i 'd not usually look at it that way because for example the czech republic feels a lot closer to us already than poland ( pis ) or hungary ( orban ) when it comes to who is currently in charge . 
  when we look at the refugee crisis for example no one but the left-extremists yell for open borders and no one but the right-extremists argue for closed borders and shooting them if they try to cross it . 
  as long as the dialogue is excluding those extremes i 'd like to think how to exactly deal with it should be for debate . 
  it * should * have been fully debated ten years ago but that 's another issue . 
  i mean , maybe it 's also a misrepresentation of the media but at least i over here am getting a * lot * more populist right-wing anti-eu sentiment from poland or hungary than i get from the czech republic . 
  if orban tomorrow says : `` fuck the eu we 're gone , sup russia ? 
  '' , would slovakia or the czech republic * really * follow suit ? 
   so no , it does n't make sense to say that you expect more from cee countries , just because of the eu funds . 
  i like that cee because it both makes more sense and is a nice differentiation . 
  =p let 's say economically that for example the v4 ditching the eu completely would hurt the rest of the eu just as much as the v4 and consider them absolutely equal here . 
  even in that case from another angle i 'd argue that it will always look like the eu is expecting more from e.g. 
  hungary simply because , politically right now , they 're further away from the mean . 
  being equal should mean respecting majority decisions and not trying to boycott them while stirring up anti-eu sentiment . 
  again we 're in a spot where i consider opt-outs of something like distribution of refugees extremely dangerous to the union as a whole - more dangerous than the threat of some countries leaving because of this . 
  shiashobobeard , you as a frequent connoisseur of the donald are surely aware of the [ convention relating to the status of refugees ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees#refugees_shall ) which states that :  countries that have ratified the refugee convention are obliged to protect refugees that are on their territory , in accordance with its terms . 
  in practice this means that a ) you let refugees get stuck in eu border countries and make it their problem or b ) you deal with it together . 
  blanket opt-outs from b ) are something i personally would consider an extremely terrible example to set because it could mean we can arrive back at a ) and now a border country is getting fucked over completely with no help whatsoever . 
  i actually do n't think we do . 
  when bavaria introduced a similar law not too long ago there were articles going around such as [ this ] ( http://ze.tt/bayern-verbietet-nicht-vorhandene-burkas-im-oeffentlichen-dienst/ ) titled '' * bavaria bans non-existant burkas for civil servants * '' since at the time of passing the law the ministry of interior clearly stated that no such woman currently exists . 
  that was pretty much just pandering for votes , i 'd not be surprised if this is the same idea . 
  i tried searching for any such case in germany and am not able to find one , maybe someone else can dig something up . 
  what we * did * have were cases of teachers for example wearing headscarves but that 's not really comparable in my opinion . 
   lol , you are basically ignoring the entire history of the middle east and have some semi racist imperialist view where the west is responsible for everything that happens in the middle east . 
  surely [ the partitioning of the ottoman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partition_of_the_ottoman_empire ) after ww1 had no influence in the me . 
  ever since the west has been fucking with that region . 
  from orchestrating [ coup d'\u00e9tats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_iranian_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat ) in 1953 in iran ( who does this guy think he is ? 
  nationalize his countries oil ? 
  with public support ? 
  not with us ! ), 
  to [ making up weapons of mass destruction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wmd_conjecture_in_the_aftermath_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq ) in 2003 in iraq . 
  yes , this is not about * everything * - it 's about a very clear pattern here that you 're trying to sweep under the rug by offering such a generalization . 
  and that 's a pattern of interference with clearly not always the most noble goals in mind . 
   also you seem to think that dictators are good and that iraq was stable i said no such thing . 
  what i * did * say is that by ensuring hundreds of thousands of people are unemployed and excluded from the political process in iraq the us actively contributed to what we now know as isis . 
  it 's no coincidence that the de-ba ` athification , which resulted in 30 % unemployment and 500000 unemployed soldiers , started shortly before the [ islamic state of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq ) became a thing . 
  you ca n't ** completely ** exclude hundreds of thousand of sunni from a countries political process under the guise of `` fair democracy '' without at least * some * of them resenting this so much that they 're resorting to violence . 
  i 'm more surprised that only a few thousand of them ended up with the so-called islamic state . 
   while merkel was welcoming the migrants [ still not true . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ )  orban is `` dictator '' ? 
  well he is not at all , but still it does not affect germany earnings . 
  you do n't think it 's concerning for germany when someone aligns with trump , putin and other people who are n't exactly advocating things that are n't in line with european or in this specific case german values ? 
  the problem is that a `` union '' means countries solving issues together . 
  a big part of the reason why germany started bypassing dublin [ during the high point ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ftggcy.png ) is because the situation got too bad in border countries and the eu was clearly incapable of dealing with it . 
  we 're talking about people * already in the eu and negatively affecting member countries * . 
  that 's when solidarity is needed , among all countries . 
  including hungary and poland . 
  _____ this is about * way * more from a german point of interest than cheap labor and buying german products . 
  1,8 % of our [ total export ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/deu/show/all/2015/ ) goes to hungary . 
  from the hungarian side that 's [ 25 % of your total import ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/hun/show/all/2015/ ) . 
  even if every 4th product in hungary is from germany for us it 's 1/50th that gets sent there . 
  analogue germany imports [ 25 % of what hungary exports ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/hun/show/all/2015/ ) while it 's also a mere [ 2,6 % of our total import ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/deu/show/all/2015/ ) . 
  even if every 4th thing that you export goes here most people would literally not notice if it disappeared from stores tomorrow . 
  i 'd personally miss l\u00e1ngos but luckily that 's not an import product . 
  =p countries like germany and france are n't investing in eastern europe primarily so you ` buy our products ' , ** we do so that you become rich enough in the future to buy our products on a similar level as other western european countries ** . 
  that 's why hungary or poland becoming strong rich countries is in our financial interest . 
  people * want * you in this union because it 's the smartest choice for everyone involved and it would be amazing if we get along in the long term . 
  also fuck the alternatives because they 're aligning with russia , the us or being isolated . 
  however , people do n't * need * you to the point where they 're fine with decisions and political tendencies going against their interest . 
   what i think is going to happen with this concept of banning burka 's in public is , that this will lead to these women not being ` allowed ' in public by their husbands or whoever imposes this one them . 
  this ban is specifically for civil servants , not less , not more . 
  the [dw.com ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/bundestag-bans-face-veils-for-civil-servants-amid-security-measures/a-38619204 ) article was a bit more clear here in the headline . 
  apart from that i agree with you . 
  that 's also where specific times in public swimming pools are coming from for exmaple . 
  the idea is that if we give them * some * spots to freely socialize with other women , even if under ` their rules ' , it 's much better overall than if we deny those rules and this results in them not going out at all . 
   restaurants & clubs are allowed to have a dresscode like no shorts or no sneakers ; but `` no burka '' would give them a discrimination lawsuit . 
  in theory you 're absolutely correct . 
  in practice ( sorry for being a bit of a dick here ) : lol . 
  clubs * already * deny entrance based on all kinds of criteria that are n't exactly cool . 
  whether it 's a persons name , color of skin , gender , whatever - it 's not uncommon that clubs deny people entrance because of these things right now . 
  when in doubt it 's `` sorry , wrong shoes '' , `` sorry , you had too much to drink already '' or a plain old `` you 're not getting in here '' and that 's it . 
  they do n't * need * to give you a reason for refusing entrance . 
  usually people do n't sue and usually they 're not blatant enough about it to make people genuinely angry but it * is * common practice in that industry and some clubs push this much harder than others . 
  =( it 's kind of a dumb subject in the first place since one benefit is * so * obvious on both sides short-term and the other is much more subtle and long term . 
  i mean , hey , the areas in germany who benefit the most from eu funds are also the ones pushing anti-eu parties because `` these eastern european parasites get money while we 're ignored !!! 11 '' . 
  i * do * think however ( maybe i 'm a terrible human being here , i 'm not sure ) that it 's reasonable to expect more from the side benefiting more from direct investment * now * than from the side playing the long game . 
  kind of like how i 'd expect more from someone studying for basically free at a university even if it 's profitable in the long run for a society to allow him to do so . 
   you ca n't say we are the biggest beneficiaries when you are benefiting even more . 
  i said :  are the biggest beneficiaries of eu funds i did n't mean to imply that german does n't benefit from you guys being around ( which is why we invest for a major part , there does n't need to be some ulterior altruistic mind set here ) , i meant to imply that if we snap with our fingers and magically remove the uk from the eu it would have a much more negative impact than if we 'd do the same with hungary . 
   why ? 
   honestly , i 'd love to know what you 've assessed of my views , and which group you seem to think i 'd fit in . 
  not a challenge as much as pure , unadulterated curiosity . 
  let me satisfy your curiosity . 
  over the past [ year ] ( http://imgur.com/a/noy9u ) you gained 30000 karma in the subreddit of a certain current us president . 
  when i google for [ trump & orban ] ( http://imgur.com/a/open4 ) i do see a certain fondness between them . 
  and let me guess , you only became a gigantic trump supporter because bernie did n't win the primary , right ? 
  [ aww , fuck ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3univld.png ) - the timeline suggests another motivation here .
