  this becomes even more amusing when one realizes that despite being a [ very frequent poster ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ntnu4 ) in / r/worldnews / r/europe / r/politics and , best of all , ** / r/conservative ** you 're clearly not doing well in any of them . 
  and now we can read [ your post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67z3pe/france_macron_is_in_favor_of_sanctions_against/dgulyt4/ ) a bit further up and understand where you 're actually coming from . 
  it also makes sense that you [ call macron ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67yscv/french_wouldbe_president_macron_says_would_seek/dgunbm7/?context=3 ) `` more dangerous to the eu than le pen . '', 
  ______ does that sufficiently answer why you fit right in the fidess voting base ? 
  turns out / u/polar _ hun had * just * the right hunch . 
   how many times am i going to have to state that any refugees we would have taken in would not stay here since we do n't have calais-style camps for them ? 
  dude , even that 's totally fine from my perspective . 
  answering `` sure we take some - giff funds so we can build camps pls ? '', 
  is something you could now smack criticism on the head with . 
  instead saying `` we do n't take any '' was used to push anti-eu sentiment in poland ( the eu is trying to force us !! ), 
  and is now used to push anti-poland sentiment with articles like this . 
   except for france because it 's ... france unrelated i know but i hope you see my point that `` all animals are equal but some are more equal than others '' when it comes to the rules of the eu . 
  i do see that point and think it 's just as bullshit . 
  now , if the statement is `` we can give france ( and italy ) some room here that other countries would get in the same spot as well '' , fine . 
  but a blanket sentence like that is bullshit . 
   just so you know , i too want cooperation but it has to be done right and not appear as if the bigger countries were telling the smaller ones what to do like macron is currently trying to do ... 
  i think the only way out of this is if countries like poland suck up some criticism ** and use it as leverage ** . 
  just like macron will get votes with this ( because he * is * right on a basic level ) in the upcoming german election schulz will get votes with this . 
  the other way out is if people like macron sit down with you after the election and clarify things . 
  `` poland gets money from us but does n't help us when it comes to refugees in return , this is unacceptable '' is just * too * fucking easy to not be used here . 
  you basically painted a gigantic target on your back by your government not being smart about this . 
  someone needs to break this cycle and the alternative france or germany has is electing anti-eu officials . 
  just based on that it * has * to be poland changing direction here imo . 
   this article is unclear ( ca n't find better in french either ) . 
  are you saying you ca n't find a clearer article in french on the same topic ** or you ca n't find a french article discussing this at all ? 
  ** there 's got ta be a french source for this ... 
  if we 're frank there is a massive difference between the uk and poland or hungary leaving the eu . 
  one was and is a massive net contributer while both [ poland ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm ) and [ hungary ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/hu/index_en.cfm ) are the biggest beneficiaries of eu funds . 
  sure , i think investing in them is a good thing and needed for them to get on the same page as others quicker which would benefit the union as a whole - but if they * do n't * want to get on the same pages on some issues i 'd rather see them leave now instead of after multiple decades of receiving massive benefits . 
   you do n't get to blame france for isis . 
  fuck that . 
  why is that even on the table ? 
  this crap was american lead and i do n't recall european countries having much influence in the [ de-ba ` athification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-ba'athification#impact ) which was the exact same dumb idea that made germany a strong ally after ww2 ** because it failed ** . 
  i mean [ look at this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/iraq_war_opponents.png ) - there was n't a single eu country in which the population was in favor of the war ( also , sweden : what the fuck ? ) . 
  to me that thing is the exact type of american influence on the european continent that we need less of , not more by attacking each other or the eu . 
   i am sorry but we did n't go into these various middle eastern countries and bomb the shit out of them , we did n't go `` wir schaffen das '' and invite them here , and yet we should take them because reasons ... 
  sigh . 
  obligatory link to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) thread . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ftggcy.png ) graph is the tl ; dr. _____ apart from that fact while i think his rhetoric is completely uncalled for and counter-productive to accomplish these current goals the basic line of reasoning is something i find myself agreeing with . 
  as a ** union ** things need to be solved together . 
  the idea that a union is great when it 's about receiving money but complete shit when it 's about helping out refugees is completely out of line . 
  the idea that countries like italy or greece were left alone in dealing with the precursor of the refugee crisis since almost ten years now is completely out of line . 
  the idea that some countries could close borders while others ( greece ) were now stuck with large amounts of refugees without any real help from the eu is completely out of line . 
  * border control and screening should be solved on an eu level . 
  * taking in and redistribution of refugees should be done on an eu level . 
  * foreign policy should be solved on an eu level . 
  * criteria for deportations should be clear on an eu level . 
  * executing said deportations should be clear on an eu level . 
  germany needs to get smacked for at least partially abandoning the screening process just as much as poland needs to get smacked for refusing to help out with the crisis . 
  the eu as a whole needs a bat over the head not just for not helping border countries early but for ** not being able to help them early ** . 
  * all * solutions to the above can be solved by strengthening the eu . 
  i want an eu in which a country like germany has to face an * extremely * high border to bypass something like dublin ( even if it barely had any effect that alone shows how well thought out that agreement was in the first place ) just as much as i want an * extremely * high border for poland to refuse taking any refugees just as much as i want all eu countries to have a really hard time wiggling out of supporting border countries with ** eu border issues ** . 
  if criticism that leads to any of this is met by electing anti-eu parties then well , maybe we did n't deserve this in the first place . 
  poland , this is your chance : the answer should be `` sure we 'll take fines for breaking eu rules . 
  ** if we address issues a , b and c and everyone else pays fines for breaking those we 're game . 
  ** when can we do that ? '', 
  ________ ** tl ; dr ** : i want the eu to protect me from bullshit germany decides as much as i want it to protect greece even if some other member states are against this . 
  a union means compromise . 
  ** co-operation  isolation . 
  always has , always will . 
  well , she frames herself as both a * nationalist * and a * socialist * , as long as the latter does n't clash with the former . 
  i can think of at least one country where this combination was pretty popular . 
  you can even argue that it was n't * unreasonable * that it was popular either . 
  but this also means that by supporting that position you have to be willfully ignorant of both the potential this represents * and * of the fact that her in parts extreme voter base feels represented by her . 
  indeed , i 'm not understanding what you 're getting at since it does n't align with the actual results . 
  the data shows that in 2012 and 1997 no gain was made in the an for the presidents party based on the 2nd round of the presidential election . 
  2007 a small win in the 2nd round ( exactly the same ballpark as 2012 and 1995 ) resulted in a 30 % boost for the presidents party . 
  ** only ** in 2002 we have a case where a massive win in the first round resulted in a 50 % + gain for the presidents party . 
  i 'm * exclusively * looking at the data available over the last 20 years without trying to distort them in any way shape or form . 
  if what you 're saying is indeed a well-known and accepted fact it 's clearly and demonstrably wrong . 
  your links for 2002 till 2012 are exactly the same sources from which my numbers above are quoted . 
  2012 and 1995 no gain was made in the an compared to the first round of the election . 
  2007 a ** small ** win in the 2nd round resulted in a 30 % boost for the presidents party . 
  2002 is the only outlier over the last twenty years that is in favor of your thesis . 
  in this case it 's both about a second term and multiple parties merging so that should be taken with a grain of salt . 
  2007 directly contradicts your thesis . 
  there 's simply no clear data over the last 20 years that supports your argument here . 
   when the president is elected , his party gets a huge boost of legitimity . 
  it keeps its momentum , prestige if you want , until the parliement election . 
  this did n't align with what i remembered , so i went through the elections since 1995 ( this obviously being an outlier since the next an was voted for in 1997 ) . 
  i 'll list the top 4 percentages candidates got in the first round of the presidential election first and in ** bold ** both the percentage of the winner of the first round , his winning percentage in the 2nd round and the percentage his party got in the parliamentary election . 
  & nbsp ; [ 1995 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_1995 ) ( chirac , right , rpr ) : ** 23 % ** 21 % 19 % 15 % - rnd2 : ** 52 % ** [ 1997 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_legislative_election,_1997 ) an : 48 % left , 46 % right , ** 22 % rpr ** & nbsp ; [ 2002 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002 ) ( chirac , right , rpr ) : ** 20 % ** 17 % 16 % 7 % - rnd2 : ** 82 % ** [ 2002 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_legislative_election,_2002 ) an : 43 % right 36 % left , ** 33 % ump ** & nbsp ; [ 2007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2007 ) ( sarkozy , left , ump ) : ** 31 % ** 26 % 19 % 10 % - rnd2 : ** 53 % ** [ 2007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_legislative_election,_2007 ) an : 50 % right , 50 % left , ** 40 % ump ** & nbsp ; [ 2012 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2012 ) ( hollande , left , ps ) : ** 29 % ** 27 % 18 % 11 % - rnd2 : ** 52 % ** [ 2012 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_legislative_election,_2012 ) an : 50 % left , 44 % right , ** 29 % ps ** & nbsp ; 2017 : 24 % 21 % 20 % 20 % ______ 1995/1997 , close win in round 2 , no boost in an . 
  2002 , 80 % win in round 2 , 50 % boost in an . 
  2007 , close win in round 2 , 33 % boost in an . 
  2012 , close win in round 2 , no boost in an . 
  ________ we have two close wins with no effect on the an , one close win with a 33 % boost for the candidates party in the an and one case with a massive win and a 50 % boost for the candidates party . 
  noteworthy here it 's about a second term * and * about parties merging together , which makes 2002 a complete outlier in comparison to the other cases on multiple levels . 
  overall i do n't think that 's enough to establish a clear trend that says `` if the president wins big in round 2 his party will do well in the an '' or `` if he does win small in round 2 his party will not gain votes in the an '' . 
  ** there really is no clear data that supports your thesis ** . 
  it 's also noteworthy that 4 candidates with more then 20 % support in the presidential election is completely unprecedented in the last 20 years and it 's not out of line to assume this fragmentation will bleed in to the parliamentary election as well . 
  e : linked to sources , just in case . 
  a ) [ this branding ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/sites/nb.com/files/2017/04/choisir_la_france-1184x665.jpg ) which aims to distance herself from the voter base she actually represents is working out . 
  b ) `` macron will win anyway , no reason to vote ! '', 
  is working out . 
  case in point : this thread . 
  _________ edit , since i 'm seeing this brought up in this thread both in english and french : c ) `` if macron wins big it means his party will gain massive votes in the next parliamentary election and i do n't want that so i 'm abstaining . '', 
  i looked at this claim in-depth [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67vcc9/lastest_polls_french_election_2017_macron_59_vs/dguacad/ ) since it does sound reasonable at first - tl ; dr there is no clear data that supports such a correlation ( or even causation ) over the last 20 years . 
   he 'll get likely the absolute majority in the assembl\u00e9e nationale , because french do n't contradict themselves in a period of time so short what keeps people from voting against le pen now and then voting for their party of choice in the assembl\u00e9e nationale ? 
  what keeps * you personally * from doing just that ? 
  more opposition for le pen * and * a weaker macron that way .
