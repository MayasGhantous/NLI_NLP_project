  win-win . 
   keep in mind that if macron does a big score , he will be more legitimate to apply his program , that is destroying the french social system . 
  then show that in the parliamentary election . 
  the presidential one is not the one to make that stand in . 
  if that climbs to the 42-45 % range till sunday there is * massive * cause for concern . 
  polls will always `` lag '' behind public opinion by a few days and there already is a clear trend visible . 
  add a bit of uncertainty , maybe sprinkle an event in there that benefits her and she has a reasonable shot . 
  if this trend continues we 're looking at 48 % vs 52 % on election day . 
  her [ branding ] ( http://www.lopinion.fr/sites/nb.com/files/2017/04/choisir_la_france-1184x665.jpg ) that aims to distance herself from the racist and bigoted voter base that brought her to that place ( and who believe she represents her interests ) seems to be working already . 
  vigilance is needed , not being complacent . 
  ... the fact that you 're openly telling people to * not vote against le pen * because it 's a `` waste of time '' is n't enough ? 
  look , i do n't know you or your political affiliations , but you 're actively helping le pen gain % points with that attitude . 
  and i 'd not be surprised in the slightest if you 're completely aware of this . 
  ... you do realize this is about punishing someone within the military ** who has right-extreme views ** , right ? 
  how dare these german fascists oppose people who `` disagree with their politics '' !, 
  they should let fascists spread freely in their military !, 
  if people in greece have a better living situation they can buy products from abroad . 
  if french companies can sell products to greece then french companies become richer and hence the french economy becomes stronger . 
  past a certain point your tax money will end up helping you ** more ** if it 's not invested in france but instead in italy , greece or even somewhere else entirely across the globe where it helps advertise french products , culture and values . 
  it 's not about the type of the subsidy but whether they 're considered as being available to the market . 
  hence those working 15h + , being literally unable to work and those in training programs are excluded from the german unemployment stat . 
  it 's a * bit * more complicated than that ( and german criteria are a lot tighter than ilo criteria overall ) but a full source can be found [ here ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/hg-arbeitslosenzahlen-101.html ) . 
   secondly german unemployment statistics are certainly not leaving out receivers of h4 . 
  hat would make zero sense . 
  i elaborated further [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67vg5z/unemployment_rate_2016/dgu314s/ ) but in a nutshell they leave * some * out . 
   he german government casually leaves out the hartz iv and other subsidy recievers out of the unemployment reports , since they do n't consider them to be unemployed . 
  this is incorrect . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/hg-arbeitslosenzahlen-101.html ) is a full source in german . 
  in a nutshell subsidy receivers who a ) are incapable of working , b ) work more than 15h and/or c ) who are currently in training for a new job are not shown in the * national * german unemployment statistic , basic reason being that none of these people are available to the market and hence should not be counted as unemployed . 
  that and other small details are why the regular german statistics are n't comparable to other nations here . 
  things like this exist for most countries . 
  however , ** international ** unemployment rates are comparable if done via [ ilo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_labour_organization ) criteria . 
  it should be noted here that traditonally unemployment via ilo criteria is ** lower ** in germany than if you look at official stastics . 
  ilo for example counts anyone working 1h or more as `` employed '' . 
  2015 the official unemployment quota in germany was 6,4 % , according to ilo stats 4.3 % . 
  _____ e : eurostat unemployment quota for germany was 4,5 % according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7149418/3-02022016-ap-de.pdf/1f0267b9-eb0a-4dc8-a3e1-cef6f8bb6caf ) in 2015 so those are again showing a lot less people that germany would usually count as unemployed . 
   vs. a fascist which at least pays lip service to maintaining the public sector and welfare state please , that 's not fascist . 
  that 's called being a nationalist and a socialist . 
  now where did i hear that before ... 
  i wonder if we can find some similarities between [ party programs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_socialist_program#the_25-point_program_of_the_nsdap ) . 
   if you have more questions feel free to ask . 
  one day later : either you or [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67g72d/eu_strengthens_control_of_the_acquisition_and/dgr69pg/ ) are getting it wrong . 
  i made a longer post about this the other day [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67ethp/russia_is_believed_to_be_the_source_of_an_influx/dgq2ly5/ ) but in a nutshell it seems * extremely * likely that at least some of the chechnyan people we got in germany over the last couple years are directly connected to kadyrov and by extension to putin . 
  ... did i mention yet that they consider some mosques their areas of influence ? 
   but world war ca n't involve the main powers fighting head on you * do * realize that * if * eu/western alliances break apart it 'd be due to a combined american , russian and french interest with the brits scratching their heads and hopefully not being a part of the madness , right ? 
  sure , it 's a very unlikely hypothetical but the major threat is n't just alliances falling apart - it 's movements in countries with nuclear weapons seemingly trying to align with each other . 
  ... you mean the western germany that had ~ 500k personal before german reunification ? 
  that 's literally impossible now unless you 'd like to renegotiate the treaty of the german reunification . 
  [ sure ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/jahresdurchschnittswerte---soldaten-bei-der-bundeswehr-1959-2010.png ) , germany can have * more * than now but the maximum allowed is pretty much in the ballpark that france currently has . 
   hitler was elected by the people just adding this here to make sure , while hitler had wide support in the last free elections in [ 1932 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_november_1932 ) he got 33 % of the popular vote . 
  it 's definitely not like he had an absolute majority behind him before germany effectively became a one party state . 
  a large role also played people who thought he 's easy to control and not a major threat to their power . 
  [ von papen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_von_papen ) comes to mind for example but more can be read [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler%27s_rise_to_power#seizure_of_control_.281931.e2.80.931933.29 ) . 
   on this day , when i was in fifth grade our history teacher brought us to the risiere di san sabbia , a concentration camp not far from my hometown , and told us that our fathers and grandfathers did this , i was so shocked i spent all my teenage years hating my country . 
  while fifth grade sounds a bit early i 'd argue that kind of experience was extremely positive to me over time . 
  one one hand the understanding that people close to your your family , `` normal '' people like you and me were capable of doing horrible things makes you emphatic towards others who might be in similar situations and also lets you understand how god damn easy liberty , freedom and democracy are lost if you 're not vigilant in protecting them . 
  on the other hand once i realized how amazing it is that * my * society put in so much effort to make sure this type of shit never happens again , to remind future generations with all kinds of backgrounds of how it happened and what happened - that 's something great to be proud of . 
  especially because it 's something i can take part in by passing on that knowledge in so many small situations . 
  there were quite a few [ assassination attempts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_assassination_attempts_on_adolf_hitler ) on hitler but that 's pretty much about it . 
   well you could make the case that wealth has to be created before it can be redistributed . 
  you created it maybe now is a better time to start redistributing wealth . 
  that 's actually a cool way to look at it , did n't see it from that angle . 
   and uhm does n't the reunification fuck over the data ? 
  there * probably * are smart things written about how exactly but my personal understanding is ( from e.g. 
  looking at [ unemployment quotas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/germanyunemploymentrate.svg ) ) that ~ '98 onwards the absolute worst seemed to be over . 
  but yeah , it 's still a massive investment and i 'm not sure how exactly it impacts which data . 
  for germany the universally loved [ agenda 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) played a major role there from what i understand . 
  but hey , it brought `` unemployment '' down and pretty much killed the german left for a decade so that 's a good thing at the expense of social equality , right ? 
  no , only about euroma . 
   but did n't know they take it so personally . 
  the [ military history of switzerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_switzerland ) should give some perspective . 
  to my understanding the swiss idea is that an armed populace is their last line of defense between neutrality and the rest of the world . 
  for reference for example just recently 73 % of their population voted * in favor * of keeping conscription . 
  without further info i 'd argue this type of thing should be implemented on an eu level , not schengen but i can understand the latter being where it needs to be implemented to be effective . 
  on the flip side the swiss voluntarily gave up some of their famous neutrality by joining schengen so ... yeah . 
   you know you 're one of them . 
  no , ** you ** desperately want me to be ` one of those people ' even if that belief is n't founded in reality . 
  here , have fun : https://redditcommentsearch.com this is where you say : `` i do n't need to search your comments because * you know you 're one of them * '' or `` ha !, 
  you probably just went through this and deleted all the evidence because i know i 'm right ! '', 
  - maybe you 've got a more creative excuse as well . 
  got ta defend beliefs to the bone , even if they clash with reality . 
   so nazi is no longer a term with a defintion , but a perception ? 
  on reddit ? 
  in an english speaking sub ? 
  people are calling trump a nazi all over the site and are n't called out left right and center . 
  on / r/de or / r/askhistorians you 'd get smacked around for using the term wrongly but in general i 'd say it 's merely an equivalent to `` someone on the right-extreme side of the spectrum '' . 
  hence , again : * i * would n't use it that way but i can * understand * it being used that way and people on that side of the spectrum should n't be surprised by this usage . 
   look you need to get used to the fact that i am going to treat you as if you are engaging in the behavior you 're defending . 
  i am not going to pretend like you do n't . 
  i 'm not praying but i 'd defend someones right to pray . 
  am i a prayer now , too ? 
   the only reason you are pretending like you do n't is because you know you 're wrong . 
  not all right-wing extremists are nazis but all nazis are right-wing extremists . 
  it 's completely understandable if someone calls someone they perceive a nazi , even if `` right wing extremist '' would have been the proper word . 
  i understand the emotional reaction , too - but that 's not gon na convince people not related to the subject to understand the logical idea behind it . 
  =p cheers , let 's hope it gets some visibility !, 
   who fling pejoratives it 's not pejorative if it 's true . 
  calling extremists extremist words is something an extremist should get used to . 
  as i explained before , you probably chose to forget , i 'd call those people right-wing extremists . 
  but i ca n't blame people who chose to go one step further and just sum it up as `` lol nazi '' .
