  i do n't have to * encourage it * or find it * good use of the word * but i can certainly * understand * it . 
  gotcha , cheers for the info . 
   maybe i will within the next days or weeks , it is quite a big topic you have to , this thread is a shitshow and even * wanting * to understand your sides is quiet hard . 
  op and his emotional outbursts and insults everywhere are n't helping either . 
  kinda sucks , especially cause the swiss ways seem special but overall pretty cool . 
  holy shit this thread . 
  can anyone , calmly and rationally , explain what the current situation is across at least a few major eu countries , what this law will change for e.g. 
  the swiss , czech or whatever and what * concrete impact * this will have with a few examples , this type of stuff ? 
  pretty please ? 
  i can understand that this is an extremely emotional topic for some people but without conveying actual proper information it 's absolutely impossible to even pick sides here . 
  the people that have an issue with this are n't doing themselves a favor when they 're not walking the non-gun people ( which likely are the majority here ) through this step-by-step . 
  i at least would like to understand where people are coming from but as it stands now that seems completely impossible based on this thread . 
   it would be stupid of anybody to , if you really were n't a pejorative slinging child , you would n't be defending other pejorative slinging children . 
  i 'm not defending pejorative slinging children , i 'm saying that if someone does x then the public having reaction y is completely understandable . 
  analogue if someone says all politicians who say x are traitors then he 's probably an extremist and it 's completely understandable if someone calls him such . 
   but even if i believed your bullshit ( for some reason ) , you standing up for that behavior puts you on their side of the argument , and if you ca n't handle that , you should n't be involved . 
  sure . 
  if it quacks like a duck i 'm in favor of calling it one . 
   becomming a collector is a pain in the ass in germany , only like 2 % of german gun owners are collectors according to pro tell . 
  just saying , those two do n't need to be related . 
  i 'm having trouble finding any german sources on this so . . yeah - i just have to take your word that whatever pro tell is is credible here ? 
  basically my issue ( with basically this entire thread ) is that i have n't seen a clear post that explains the differences and issues to non-gun people like me . 
  the [ sites ] ( http://www.rotewbk.de/produkte/sammlerwbk/sammlerwbk.html ) i can find [ talking ] ( http://www.waffensammelpass.de/wbk ) about the professional certificate seem shady but there is also no real info how hard or easy that is to get . 
  ... ca n't one of you informed guys actually sum this all up anywhere in this thread ? 
  :3 - current laws , comparisons , concrete impact of this law across at least a few eu states ? 
  it 's * really * hard to even form a position on this without proper information . 
   you 're defending that behavior , but you want to be seen as somebody who does n't indulge in it . 
  i can defend someone 's religious rights while being an atheist myself . 
  analogue i can say that calling people with extremist statements that call others traitors for saying certain things ` nazis ' is not something they should find surprising - even while no doing it myself . 
   or a collector that ... allows a shitload of guns . 
  here is the list of guns that a collector ** ca n't ** possess : * firearms defined as `` war weapons '' by the law ( tanks , rocket launchers , heavy machine guns ) * fully automatic firearms * pump-action shotguns , if - the stock has been replaced by a pistol grip or - the overall length is less than 95 cm , or - the barrel length is less than 45 cm . 
  * firearms designed to look like an everyday object in order to conceal their nature * handguns made after january 1 , 1970 that fire ammunition with a caliber of less than 6.3 mm , except those for rimfire ammunition . 
  ___ * collecting and firearms ' experts : a red license is issued to collectors and firearms experts . 
  ** with this type of license , all kinds of firearms except `` forbidden firearms '' may be purchased without prior approval . 
  ** while an expert 's license is valid for all guns , collectors have to provide a `` theme '' of firearms they want to acquire , and are limited to those . 
  to my knowledge , regarding the ` theme ' you * can * select multiple and that 's how most people get around wanting to own lots of different weapons . 
  i was merely clarifying your continuous accusations that you keep insisting on . 
  you do n't get to weasel out of claiming another person said something they did n't . 
  slimy . 
   look and germany . 
  you cant even buy bolt actions without some stupid license over there , yet it started with taking the semis you mean the ` stupid license ' that basically says `` this guy owns a gun , is not mentally disabled , not an alcoholic and not a criminal '' ? 
  to my knowledge , obviously feel free to correct me since i 'm not even claiming to be well informed here , it 's pretty damn easy to own various guns in germany and [ our law ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/waffenbesitzkarte_ ( deutschland \\ ) ) only becomes * super * tight when it comes to [ carrying ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/waffenschein ) them in public . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gun_legislation_in_germany#current_laws ) is an english speaking source for anyone curious . 
  i get that this is kind of an emotional topic for you guys but basically this thread is full of muhhh guns no guns bad omg rawrrrrrrrrrrrrrr from multiple sides . 
  can you or anyone else * please * make a post where this is talked through calmly ? 
  i , like probably most people here , have no idea what your current laws permit exactly , what czech laws permit exactly and what this eu law will mean in terms of a ** concrete impact ** . 
  i 'm * barely * informed on german gun laws ( i 've been told [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0-j2pylcvi ) video is a good introduction ) and it 's far from `` until all we can own are single shot .22 lr rifles '' to my understanding as well . 
  also , to my knowledge , you can own and use a lot of shit but it 's incredibly tight on * carrying it in public * . 
  sincerely , someone who so far only knows the swiss as one of the few countries who combine high gun ownership + safety . 
  if such a post already exists , please refer me to it . 
  feel free to quote me where i called anyone a nazi . 
  and yes , i still find it completely understandable if others do so if someone spews that kind of bullshit . 
  free franconia this is the chance, 
  they have the sexiest german accent on the entire globe . 
  seriously , that pumpkin seed oil is absolutely amazing . 
  e : also [ almdudler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almdudler ) , how could i miss that ? 
  was [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fldprto.png ) what you were alluding to ? 
  do i need to ask / r/askhistorians now to figure out which of you has the right angle ? 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fire_of_moscow_ ( 1812 \\ ) ) seems pretty clear but , yeah . 
  in his defense there only recently was a pretty well-researched ( german ) [ documentary ] ( https://www.zdf.de/dokumentation/zdfzoom/zdfzoom-putins-kalter-krieg-100.html ) about russian sponsored chechnyan spies in germany . 
  this includes some of them or people related to them being afraid for their lives because they refuse to cooperate ( e.g. 
  [ apti bisultanov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apti_bisultanov ) or [ ekkehard maa\u00df ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ekkehard_maa%c3%9f ) ) . 
  in 2009 [ umar israilov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umar_israilov ) was murdered by chechnyan asylum seekers in vienna so those fears might very well not be unfounded . 
   on january 23 , 2009 , lema gudayev , kadyrov 's press secretary , alleged that the media had `` launched a massive and deliberate campaign aimed at discrediting the leadership and the president of the chechen republic . '', 
  for example timur dugazaev ( a well known boxing promoter ) is freely admitting ( 24:20 in the above documentary ) that some people spy on other chechnyans living in germany and that he reports this back to [ kadyrov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramzan_kadyrov ) personally . 
  chechnyans were also connected with the russian-german demonstrations in germany when it came to the case of [ lisa f. ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminal_case_of_lisa_f . ), 
  russian media and protesters pushed the narrative that she was kidnapped and raped ( obviously by immigrants ) which turned out to be completely false . 
  also yes , the above kadyrov is the same who is currently involved ( and responsible ) for [ gay concentration camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gay_concentration_camps_in_chechnya ) in chechnya . 
  in den moscheen ? 
  in a nutshell , to not make this an even larger wall of text he freely admits to spying on other chechnyans ( mostly via mosques ) because they 're afraid of them going back to chechnya where they might commit suicide bombings . 
  he adds ( when asked if this information goes to e.g. 
  russian intelligence agencies ) that something like this is n't needed because he 's in direct contact with kadyrov and that what he says is enough for him . 
  when asked directly he says `` no '' to whether they also have an eye on people who disagree with kadyrov . 
  ... as for kadirovs background , great relation to putin and human rights abuses , yeah . 
  that 'd be a longer topic . 
   the euro is adapted to germany , it 's too strong for many of the other economies . 
  meanwhile the us is accusing us of artificially pushing the euro down because that supposedly benefits germany and destroys the eu . 
  haha . 
  i had this exact discussion with a french friend of mine the other day , with me thinking france has stronger unions and with him thinking germany has stronger unions . 
  turns out we 're both rather pathetic in that regard : [ source . 
  ] ( http://img.zeit.de/karriere/2014-10/gewerkschaftsmitglieder/wide__820x461__desktop ) % of people in unions , yellow = germany , pink = france . 
  basically we 're around 15-20 % and you 're around 10 % . 
   part of germany 's success is due to a series of reforms pushed through by the social-green government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder ten years ago , overhauling the labour market and welfare system . 
  dude . 
  * dude . 
  * that program was so universally hated that you can call it responsible for merkels rise , among other things . 
  schroeders party got so destroyed by the aftermath that they 've been trying to distance themselves from it ever since . 
  you can find more info [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agenda_2010 ) but the english article is a bit lacking . 
  though yes : it did force a wage crisis in germany . 
   another sign that economic inequality has risen in germany can be seen in the fact that the number of germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11 % in 2001 , [ 10 ] to 12.3 % in 2004 , [ 11 ] and about 14 % in 2007 . 
  according to 2007 government statistics , one out of every six children was poor , a post-1960-record , with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  but yes , unemployment went from ~ 10 % to ~ 7 % in the aftermath . 
  i 'd argue it 's more of * despite * those reforms instead of * because * of them . 
   the shadow goverment of usa  a man `` designed '' to be the perfect puppet citation needed . 
  also nice old rarely used account you got there . 
   the people who did not want to support her reforms of the party are gone , or they stayed and accepted them . 
  you 're tip-toeing around the point i made : if 18 % of the population supported a racist , bigoted agenda in 2002 - where are those voters now ? 
  * a ) they all accepted the new fn program and there is no interest fora right-wing extremist party in france . 
  * b ) they still feel represented by the ` new ' fn program and the fn is still a party with a right-extremist voter base . 
  every single right-extremist , racist and bigot ** has ** to vote fn .
