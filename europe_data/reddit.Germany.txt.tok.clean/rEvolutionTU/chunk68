  and those are the voters marine le pen still represents . 
  they 're part of the bloc trying to bring her into power because they feel she represents their interests . 
   that 's not really one of the things that most fn voters care about . 
   but i just dont think le pen cares and loves russia as much as the media tells us she does . 
  you do n't care if one country on the same continent violates borders of another ? 
  how is that not absolutely extremist ? 
  there is no peace without borders that respected . 
  she called an * invasion and annexation of a sovereign nation legitimate * . 
  i do n't think the media tells us enough how much she loves putin . 
   understand though , that the fn is gaullist . 
  it 's all about focusing on france and not being subordinate to anyone . 
  you can believe me that whether its the usa or russia , no fn voter would like to be told lessons on what to do by either these states . 
  this is why charles de gaulle championed france developing own nukes , so we dont get pushed by either these states . 
  you mean the charles de gaulle who wanted an [ eu without any supranational elements ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fouchet_plan ) that also has a common defense and a common foreign policy ? 
  the one who wanted a strong and united europe that can move away from nato and the us ? 
   it 's all about focusing on france and not being subordinate to anyone . 
  de gaulle did n't just focus on france however in his actions . 
  he championed the [ \u00c9lys\u00e9e treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89lys%c3%a9e_treaty ) , he pushed for a different vision of a strong eu but was fine with the alternative when it came down to agreeing to something . 
  hell , he 'd be really damn happy about european cooperation without the uk , too . 
  =p but sure , it all boils down to quotes like this :  `` europe is the means for france to recover what it ceased to be after waterloo : first in the world '' that 's what le pen represents . 
  a delusional view that somehow there could be a hegemony of any state on european soil without bloodshed . 
  you do n't see the danger in this general attitude ? 
  ________ fuck russia and the us . 
  without a united europe you 're not supporting some gaulist vision - you 're supporting the mess we had before ww1 . 
  if every nation on european soil puts their own interests first , we all lose . 
  either to ourselves or to other power blocks . 
   it 'll be just gone , and by the time europeans come to the bright idea to unite again because united we 're stronger ( to the surprise of nobody that can count ) , i might be trying to handle one billion africans storming into europe because africa is drying under global warming out as we speak - only i 'll be handling that alone because it 's every country for itself . 
  without the eu it 's only a matter of time till european nations go to war with each other or become even more of a playing ball for other blocks . 
  or both . 
  i do n't get how that 's so hard to see for some people . 
  if every european nation puts its own interests first we 'll all lose . 
   i keep hearing people saying that unemployement is lower in germany because people can be paid a much lower wage than they would in france alright now i 'm curious . 
  that 's the first time i heard german workers being called cheap , but it would obviously not be paraded around here if it was true . 
  is there a way to figure this out like picking a few specific jobs that make sense and compare net pay ? 
  i 'd * assume * health care is at least similar enough to not make a massive difference . 
  alright , stay with me for a second . 
  if we can agree that the fn of 2002 was a right-wing extremist and nationalist party that got 18 % of the popular vote , where did those 18 % go ? 
  if the fn does n't support those extremist voters anymore are you saying they 're all being mislead into voting for the party ? 
  you just said a lot of people in the fn resent her for what she has done to the party . 
  so * those * guys are n't supportive of her line but are n't expelled either ? 
   the only `` extreme '' thing they support is being anti-eu . 
  one thing that immediately comes to mind , note my french is lousy so i 'd not be surprised if other posters can find other examples , was her calling the russian annexation of crimea completely legitimate . 
  openly supporting one state to extend its borders into another against the will of the defending government is a * bit * extreme , is n't it ? 
   i absolutely disagree that it was an illegal annexation : a referendum was held and residents of crimea chose to rejoin russia . 
   i meant that she could actually question the details of the details of the holocaust without being thrown in prison questioning details of the holocaust does not get you thrown into prison in germany . 
  calling it for example `` the biggest and longest-lasting lie in history '' will however eventually if you keep it up long enough . 
   the northeast regions used to be the core of industrial manufacturing and mining of france . 
  maybe stupid question since i heard this story for trump and now here again . 
  when i look at the german rhineland i see [ nrw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_rhine-westphalia ) at [ 7.7 % unemployment ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/2513/umfrage/entwicklung-der-arbeitslosenquote-in-nordrhein-westfalen-seit-1999/ ) ( lowest since 1994 ) or areas like [ lower saxony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lower_saxony ) at [ 6 % unemployment ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/2511/umfrage/entwicklung-der-arbeitslosenquote-in-niedersachsen-seit-1999/ ) ( another historic low at the moment ) . 
  the hell did we do different that our industrial areas have * low * unemployment ? 
  nrw for example has been social democrat ( left-centre ) for decades , too . 
  for us the right-wing votes seem to correlate more with being in the former gdr than unemployment or previously being industrial centers . 
  sure that area has its own share of problems , but yeah . 
  unless i 'm missing something i do n't see this correlation between industrial center , unemployment and right-wing voters in germany to the same degree here . 
  what makes the federal system in spain special ? 
  what parts do you think make it strong and what weak ? 
  also what could germany or france learn from it ? 
  ... meanwhile i regularly feel like we over here have too much federalism . 
  is this a case of greener grass on the other side or is any of this actually quantifiable ? 
  things like having different school systems , opening times for stores or holidays feel completely nonsensical to me . 
  i do n't even want to get into bavaria being a special snowflake ~ what things do you think germany does well regarding its federalism ? 
   i am a fn voter , you have no idea how many people in the fn ressent marine le pen for what she has done to the party . 
  the big point however is that those people still vote fn and are still represented and tolerated by the party . 
  so either marine le pen is a traitor to those who vote for her the longest and most fiercely ( while still gladly taking their votes ) or she 's only pretended to move to the center all this time and her voter base represents her actual interests . 
  the fn gained less than 5 % since 2002 . 
  did all the people who loved their ideas back then just vanish ? 
  did they move to the center with marine ? 
  why did n't the extremists split off if they 're against being represented by her ? 
   i bet that before doing this , that she had some polling done , though , to test out the viability of the move . 
  that ... is something rather simple i did n't even think about . 
  it * could * be that polling was n't even needed to figure that out . 
  the huge , huge variable in all this is still cambridge analytica to me . 
  especially because they 're rather unknown , were in bed with brexit , trump , bannon and mercer while the niece of le pen had talks with them and we do n't know how influential their approach is exactly or whether their ceo oversells them . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dd5avxlcc ) is reasonable introduction on what they claim to be doing from the boss himself . 
   this move to me reek more of desperation than of a incredibly smartly planned political move . 
  you 're right , could very well be that it 's that angle and overall wo n't impact the results much or at all . 
  it 's the more likely version for sure . 
  i got ta say tho i 'd rather assume it 's part of a larger strategy and be surprised if it is n't than assume it 's pure desperation and be surprised it was n't . 
   if le pen can significantly narrow her deficit with macron over the next two weeks , macron 's supporters will have reason to worry . 
  if she still trails by something like 26 points on election day , however , a le pen victory would be essentially unprecedented . 
  that 's pretty much the tl ; dr from the article that i fully agree with . 
  i * trust * the polls and i do n't think that deficit can be overcome if election day was tomorrow . 
  but it 's not , and a lot of it can change . 
  she distances herself from the party , things like [ enf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_nations_and_freedom ) and [ cambridge analytica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_analytica ) add their online propaganda , another attack can happen . 
  what this move signifies to me more than anything else is that there is a planned strategy for this exact scenario . 
  this is unlikely to be a spur of the moment thing . 
  if polls move to a ~ 15 point lead with one week remaining , then i 'll actually start genuinely assuming there 's a chance for her winning . 
  but before then it does n't pay to start being vigilant when something like this happens . 
  hmm ... 
  i trust the current polls . 
  what 's important to note though is that polls will `` lag '' behind the current opinion since people tend to take a few days to even rationalize their change in position when it 's all a bit grey to them currently . 
  if this causes a 3-5 % shift with one week remaining it might end up way too close on election day . 
  if with one week remaining polls have n't moved at all i 'll be a lot less worried . 
  got ta trust that 's how it works out . 
  i do n't * think * people would get fooled by this but it 's not like it would be the first time . 
  i 'd like to think so . 
  however , we need to assume that her buddies in germany , the netherlands and whoever else collaborates in the [ enf ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_of_nations_and_freedom ) will likely throw their weight behind this , especially if it comes to online propaganda . 
  the german afd alone for example has an * extremely * strong online presence that easily beats other major parties . 
  also we still do n't know how influential [ cambridge analytica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambridge_analytica ) really is . 
  the one edge france has if it comes to this is hopefully being suspicious enough and also being insulated well enough because of the language .
