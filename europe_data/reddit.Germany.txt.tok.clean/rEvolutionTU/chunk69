  i 'd look out for facebook dark posts and similar shenanigans like a hawk though . 
  ___ e : also i hate to even think about it but , well , terror attacks . 
  i 'd not count that out for another few % shifting . 
  not like that type of event being beneficial to her needed her to move to the center though . 
  it 's definitely a smart and probably her only choice . 
  what makes it scary is that macron has no such possibility : he already claims to be the center . 
  with this le pen aims to do the following things : * give non-macron moderates ( e.g. 
  left fillon voters ) a reason to vote for her . 
  * give her supporters a platform to support her from and advertise her from this angle . 
  ( `` i would never vote fn but marine le pen is something else entirely ! '' ), 
  * it draws people who are afraid of terror attacks ( and think the fn is too extreme ) but who consider her herself a nice person , basically a large attack on single issue voters . 
  those who like her social policies in general ( but do n't like the racist undertones of the fn ) are another main target . 
  to draw a comparison , when the far-right german afd started being open about their far-right agenda last december ( they at least tried to have this type of double-image before than ) they lost ~ 25 % of their voters . 
  analogue i would not be surprised if this gives le pen a 25 % boost if it can be conveyed within the two remaining weeks . 
  if we presume a 60:40 split now ** this could push to 50:50 extremely fast ** . 
  it * needs * to be exposed for what it is : ** a populist who has years and decades of the far-right supporting this agenda moving to the middle purely to gather votes that would otherwise never consider her party line . 
   `` she had previously said she is not a candidate of her party and the policy platform she stood was hers and not reflective of the front national . '', 
  so she 's gathering the votes of the far-right under her wing ( no one on that side of the spectrum has any alternative to vote for ) and will now move to the middle to gather more voters . 
  `` look , she 's not that bad - it 's her * personal * platform and not reflective of all the racists and bigots !, 
  look how she changed ! '', 
  [ hotelling 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hotelling%27s_law ) in action ladies and gentlemen . 
  the only thing left to hope is that not too many people fall for it . 
  that 's an * extremely * dangerous move . 
  i do n't disagree , but ` raising defense budget ' in this context still means the rough level of 1994 in terms of armed personal is the cap . 
  it 's twice of what 's around currently so , yeah , there 's room for growth . 
  what i 'm getting at is however that for the foreseeable future it 's not likely that germany will carry more weight than france when it comes to military matters . 
  france is clearly \\ # 1 and uncontested there within the eu now with the uk being gone . 
  the 2 +4 treaty being touched is super unlikely any time soon , at least from the german side . 
  ah yes , the 1970s , a time when germany embraced holocaust denial . 
  how could i forget ? 
   in other words , a third way ? 
  that is what bill clinton and blair preached , won and governed . 
  this precise idea became known as `` neo-liberalism '' . 
  what he 's talking about seems to be the * german * third way aka [ social market economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_market_economy ) . 
   the social market economy was designed to be a third way between laissez-faire economic liberalism and socialist economics . 
   germany [ two plus four agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany#treaty ) . 
  the german army for example ca n't have more than 370k personal ( last it was there in 1994 ) , ca n't have access to nuclear weapons and similar things . 
  france for example , right now , has roughly as much active personal ( 320k ) as germany is allowed to have as her maximum . 
  italy is at ~ 100k , spain at ~ 74k and poland at ~ 77k . 
  germany at ~ 180k which is the lowest since the reunification . 
  you 'd basically need to change the agreements in that kind of treaty if you 'd ever want an actual decent sized german army and that 's a can of worms that 's not going to be opened any time soon . 
   several courts have sentenced her and her punishments include two fines and another suspended sedition sentence . 
  she was on trial last year for saying that the holocaust was `` the biggest and longest-lasting lie in history . '', 
  if you violate the law , multiple times in fact , then sentences are going to get harsher . 
  old age does not protect you from that . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/677iij/today_is_armenian_genocide_remembrance_day/dgoqi3h/ ) is a more detailed post i just made but in a nutshell , at least for germany , political parties have nothing to do with it . 
  there * is * the possibility to ban parties in germany ( as of now this only applies to the nsdap and kpd ( communist party ) ) , but this is done based on them going against the german constitution * and * being able to influence public opinion with this sentiment . 
  as someone checking out this chain `` i vivdly remember readin and commenting about it on stormfront '' was a funnier punchline than i did expect . 
  thanks for taking one of the team here good sir . 
   wait , so if i live in a county where pot smoking is illegal . 
  i ca n't anonymously discuss how to smoke it in the relevant subreddit ? 
  it 's more like if you live in a country that restricts speech about smoking pot then discussing it in the relevant subreddit might be illegal . 
  random example that applies to americans for example :  speech is unprotected if ( 1 ) `` the average person , applying contemporary community standards , would find that the [ subject or work in question ] , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest '' and ( 2 ) `` depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , contemporary community standards , sexual conduct defined by the applicable state law '' and ( 3 ) `` the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value '' . 
  [ [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miller_test ) ], 
  and where can i have such unlimited and pure free speech where i can say whatever i 'd like ? 
  just in case you 're about to cite the us as an example : [ nope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions ) , pretty sure that does n't count if you 're against any restriction of free speech . 
   because this is a literal attack on free speech . 
  my specific examples will come from a first and foremost german perspective since that 's what i 'm most familiar with . 
  since you 're going for a broader angle than just genocide denial specifically i 'll respond broader as well . 
  * all countries ` attack ' free speech . 
  yes , this [ includes the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_free_speech_exceptions ) , noteworthy also [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_the_united_states ) article on censorship . 
  * saying that something did n't happen is not just `` an opinion '' , it 's something that aims to actively attack the human dignity of the victims and their offspring . 
  * some societies agree that certain things are not wanted in their society . 
  the idea is that these kind of ` opinions ' do not contribute in any way shape or form to a healthy society and have exclusively negative outcomes . 
  further reading material can be found with the [ paradox of tolerance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradox_of_tolerance ) , and the german concept of a [ militant democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) . 
  long story short is that freedom and democracy are seen as things that will , given enough time and random chance , eventually disappear if we allow those who are against them to spread their ideas easily . 
  there is no shame in being tolerant of things that are intolerant in nature . 
  and before someone asks , yes , the vast majority of these laws do n't just extend to the right side of the spectrum but against anything that goes against the good ol' liberal democratic order . 
  yesss that 's it !, 
  thanks , i never actually saw the original anywhere , that stop sign is just priceless . 
  no , fake news !, 
  ** hopefully someone can find an english - or frenchspeaking source , i only know about the story from [ this ] ( http://www.europa.clio-online.de/essay/id/artikel-3766 ) german article . 
  google translate version [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.europa.clio-online.de%2fessay%2fid%2fartikel-3766 ) . 
  the gist is that right after chernobyl french media was n't too ... keen on talking about higher radiation on their side of the border . 
  `` journal de 20 heures '' ( 20 o'clock news ) , antenne 2 , 30.04.1986 should be the main source material . 
   nope , they do not [ here ] ( http://auschwitz.org/en/history/the-number-of-victims/ ) , might as well link to the official auschwitz site . 
  or [ here ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?moduleid=10005143 ) have the literally first link on google for `` holocaust museum '' which leads to the us holocaust memorial museum . 
  but ** clearly ** they are very one sided and highly manipulated places . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/545305/i_am_serj_tankian_from_system_of_a_down_along/ ) , a link to his latest ama where that 's quite a frequent topic too . 
   it is a meme of sorts that we germans are deeply ashamed of the nazi crimes on a personal basis . 
  but that is absolutely not true . 
  i 'd even argue the contrary since if you take a step back the way german society * handled * the nazi crimes is pretty damn amazing . 
  once you wade through that swamp of horrible and vile things your ancestors did and you see the steps * your * society made to ensure this will remind future generations of what happened that 's where you personally can be proud of how things are handled - because it 's something where you can contribute small things in a lot of spots where others still try to change history . 
  the understanding that under specific circumstances rather regular people like you and me can get dragged into the most atrocious things also serves as a reminder of how things can spiral out of control . 
  i think this strong dedication to remembering with the intent of hopefully helping to prevent these types of events from happening in the future is a massive achievement . 
  ... it 's also a very good case for how some type of de-nazification should happen ( hint : it did n't go as planned ) . 
  too bad that for the [ de-ba ` athification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-ba'athification#impact ) these lessons were forgotten . 
   ** i highly doubt any of the 100 or so holocaust museums around the world recognize any other victims than jews . 
  ** what kind of crap is this ? 
  [ here ] ( http://auschwitz.org/en/history/the-number-of-victims/ ) , might as well link to the official auschwitz site . 
  or [ here ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?moduleid=10005143 ) have the literally first link on google for `` holocaust museum '' which leads to the us holocaust memorial museum . 
  but ** clearly ** they exclusively recognize jewish victims because `` the jews '' ensure the holocaust must be seen as a jewish event . 
  that 's just politics !, 
  you could have looked up this type of information within seconds but instead you chose to frame it as classic anti-semitic `` but the jews !!! '' - propaganda . 
  well done . 
  i mean , i do kind of understand where you 're coming from but trying to defend german reunification being called `` an annexation and a sign of german expansionism '' from that angle is a pretty insane step . 
  maybe you did n't intend that , it just certainly sounded like it when you took that initial quote and argued in favor . 
  =p  it 's not the money , we should probably spend much more . 
  it 's the fabric of the eastern society that is entirely dismantled . 
  it was built for a different way of life that does not exist anymore today and we are only left behind with the wasteland , so that slowly ghost towns start to emerge .
