  if one poll says one thing and ** every other poll ** says something else then clearly everyone else must be lying , right ? 
   by the way , if trump was my first concern i would pit merkel instad of schulz against him . 
  same here tbh . 
  to me , right now , schulz has massive potential in uniting the eu during times of stability . 
  4 years ago he would gotten my vote much easier than this election . 
  however , merkel to me is one of a kind and , despite all her failures , has proven the calm and calculated reactions i value highly during crisis . 
  on the bright side i do n't think either would be * bad * by any definition of the word , so overall i 'm pretty glad with the current situation . 
  akin to what / u/kalimere pointed out i 'm also very firmly against unregulated free speech . 
  i do n't believe that being able to freely show others the middle finger , yelling `` god hates fags '' or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwvdsmmjnjo ) type of crap should be freely possible without * any * legal ways to deal with it . 
  german law specifically covers all of the above examples ( and more ) under various regulations for example . 
  yeah , that 's a weirdly phrased question . 
  i 'd personally answer `` no '' to it because `` free speech in all circumstances '' ... `` even if offensive to '' suggests an american-framed idea of free speech to me which i consider to be pretty disgusting compared to e.g. 
  the german standard . 
  ____ `` offensive '' is such a broad english specific word that 's being used here compared to e.g. 
  `` insult '' which is tighter defined and would be against german law . 
  to me it 's just such a truly dumb issue in the first place . 
  we can probably all agree that any non-eu citizen that comes to the eu is an issue of everyone withing the union . 
  having at least an eu wide control of the outer eu borders is , at least to me , the only reasonable way to deal with those issues . 
  but then the countries that i perceive as complaining the most about `` illegals '' are also the ones who are the least interested in relinquishing any border control . 
  you ca n't * both * insist on everyone dealing with their own problems and * also * complain that the eu as a whole is n't doing what needs to be done . 
   but this article is objectively bad it * should * be noted that in the [ spiegel article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/bundeswehr-fake-news-attacke-gegen-deutsche-soldaten-in-litauen-a-1134925.html ) the dw.com article references the headline was recently changed from '' * russia attacks ... with fake news * . '', 
  to '' * nato assumes russia to be behind the fake news attack * . '', 
  but i do n't know how recently . 
  the article claims that it has sources which directly assume russian involvement and clearly states while the account itself was confirmed no german official wanted to confirm or deny information about the background or the perpetrators . 
  _________ all that being said : where i need to agree here is that what is * objectively * bad is alleging russia without clarifying that this was ** not ** said by any official source ( at least as of yesterday evening ) . 
  however , this is only written this way in the 1st headline and is phrased more precisely in the 2nd headline and the rest of the article . 
  just to nitpick , * technically * there are always more parties than one with such an interest ( all the way down to extremists from any direction , belarus or even fractions in the us ) and / u/leemylammy does have a point in general . 
  ** however ** between both the german and french intelligence agencies * pointing * towards russia lately and the involvement of pro-kremlin chechnyan sleeper agents coming out in the lisa case on top of whatever information officials that are alleging russia in this case have ... odds are reasonable that 's the most likely direction its coming from . 
  not to mention the trouble that 's been stirring up for weeks now around belarus/russia/poland and by extent lithuania . 
  source is right there in the provided link . 
  wiki and then a bbc article . 
  ________  3 ) polish frontex units apperentely already operate in greece . 
  afaik that 's not entirely correct :  some 60 border guards , 40 police officers and 20 ** experts from the foreigners office ** are set to travel to the southern eu country ** to support the frontex border agency ** and the european asylum support office ( easo ) , the interior ministry said on sunday . 
  [ [ source ] ( http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/artykul/250104,polish-officials-to-support-greece-in-eu-border-protection ) ] so yes , poland ** does ** support the voluntary projects in italy and greece but it does ** not ** support pushing frontex itself further . 
  even the frontex hq staying in warsaw was not guaranteed as far as i know ( not sure if that has changed in the year since the article ) :  instead , the current legal basis for frontex 's operations in poland is based on a 2006 `` memorandum of understanding '' that expired in 2007 , meaning there is no firm legal basis for frontex to be there . 
  ** warsaw has consistently argued that frontex employees should not be treated as eu diplomats and should be subject to polish law ** . 
   fabrice leggeri , the executive director of frontex , said that this situation was untenable : `` if tomorrow [ the polish government ] wanted to shut us down , they could do it -- and that is unacceptable . ''  he added : `` ** the agency must be independent and not have to rely on the goodwill of poland ** . '' [ [ source ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/4a09367c-a34c-11e5-bc70-7ff6d4fd203a ) ] with more info . 
  ________ in a nutshell , at least that 's what i understand , poland agrees that frontex needs to be replaced by a stronger agency but the polish government does ** not ** support any proposal that would allow any eu supranational agency to actually * control * borders . 
  hence they support the current style ( the nation being full in charge of everything with an agency existing that could be deployed to assist at the countries request ) which drives up cost , is less efficient and much slower to react . 
  maybe you can find some better sources though , i did n't spend * that * much time researching it and i also do n't have access to any polish sources that might give a more well-defined larger answer . 
   i simply do n't know , i do n't think you can expect eu forcing eg ( pro-russian ) hungary to send their own troops to finland , if attacked ? 
  that 's why the solution is an eu-army where hungarian , spanish , swedish or german soldiers work together in their respective units . 
  this stuff needs to be sorted in peacetime and interwoven well enough that no country ** can ** back out in the case of an emergency . 
  apart from that i fully agree , this idea of cherrypicking good stuff and finding ways to opt-out of things like equal gay rights or helping out refugees is unsustainable . 
   could you provide any source for your claim that poland opposed supporting frontex ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex  the new agency was proposed by the european commission on 15 december 2015 [ 13 ] to strengthen frontex , widely seen as being ineffective in the wake of the european migrant crisis . 
  support for the proposal has come from france and germany , with poland and hungary expressing opposition to the plan , concerned by the perceived loss of sovereignty . 
  the actual [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35093827 ) wiki cites sounds a bit nicer and does n't include hungary , so maybe there 's more to it than the wiki article . 
  _________  in this case however many top european politicians actually wanted to let all the immigrants in from the very beginning of the crisis , saying it 's the right thing to do and we would benefit from this decision . 
  first of all the ` right thing to do ' came from [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union ) little thing here and more specifically article 18 of said document . 
  ___________  i totally agree we are obligated at least to try to help those who are in danger , but it was n't fair to ignore all obvious consequences of this decision . 
   and they want now to force poland to take in group of these people , even if it 's not working for them and render serious safety issues . 
  why did they agree to treaties ( under pis , the current ruling party even ) they did n't intend to uphold ? 
  at least from my perspective poland is cherrypicking things it likes ( e.g. 
  getting the [ biggest share ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm#projects ) of eu funds ) and tries to dodge things it does n't like whereever it can ( not wanting to have gay rights `` forced '' on them and now opting out of taking in refugees ) . 
  that 's a state that is , at least from my point of view , completely unacceptable . 
  _________  these people ca n't be even properly verified anymore . 
  so how does poland suppose to cooperate with the eu when it gets bashed for not wanting to explicitly endanger its citizens . 
  do you know why they ca n't be properly verified anymore ? 
  because first countries like greece were ( understandably ) incapable to deal with the influx . 
  because the agencies in place ( frontex ) to help out there are underfunded , understaffed and are lacking authority . 
  because some countries decide that they want complete control over their own borders which is a choice that ends up hurting all eu member states . 
   so how does poland suppose to cooperate with the eu when it gets bashed for not wanting to explicitly endanger its citizens . 
  because the entire thing ** started ** in the first place because specific countries decided they value their sovereignty more than the integrity of the eu itself . 
  i want migrants and refugees cataloged , verified and even fingerprinted just like the next guy . 
  but if poland suddenly decides rules they agreed to play by are `` endangering their citizens '' ( for which they have no actual basis besides them being afraid that it * could * endanger their citizens on a unreasonable scale ) that 's a massive , massive problem . 
  again , every single refugee or migrant that we ca n't deal with anywhere in the eu in the sense that he is at least verified and cataloged on entrance or in the sense that he gets a place to stay once we granted asylum status is an issue of every single goddamn country . 
  any solution that does n't start there is unsustainable . 
   i 'd love to hear how the blame for eu responding poorly to the immigration crisis falls on the shoulders of hungary and poland , who by the way are participating in operation triton . 
  poland does , hungary does not . 
   as it seems it often devolves into a migrant ferry service and not a force that 's stopping illegal immigration i 'm gon na need a source for that claim . 
  again , the laws that you quoted higher up are a different issue that also needs to be addressed . 
  _______  here 's where i see the problem , there is no `` nice '' humanitarian solution to the problem and none of the politicians want to sign something where the media would paint them as responsible for the deaths of migrants trying to enter eu illegally . 
   you want to share the asylum load ? 
  i do n't , because it 's a broken system with no end in sight . 
  asylum should be an exception and not an immigration channel like it is now . 
  i fully support us helping people in refugee camps , but people who try to enter eu illegally should not be awarded with full benefits , they should be deported without mercy . 
  are you fully aware of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union ) little thing ? 
  [ here ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a12012p%2ftxt ) in full text . 
  we 're talking about one of ** the ** founding documents of the eu that all member states fully accepted when they joined . 
  notable exception here who took selective opt-outs ( which i do n't have a positive opinion on but that 's another topic ) : [ poland & the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union#charter_of_fundamental_rights_of_the_european_union_.e2.80.93_poland_and_the_united_kingdom ) . 
   poland 's then ruling party , law and justice , mainly noted concerns that it might force poland to grant homosexual couples the same kind of benefits which heterosexual couples enjoy , while the uk was worried that the charter might be used to alter british labour law , especially as relates to allowing more strikes . 
  read through it . 
  when you get to article 18 , which goes back all the way to [ 1951 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_relating_to_the_status_of_refugees ) then maybe you 'll get an idea with regards to why ** it 's the duty of the media to paint them as responsible for the deaths of migrants trying to enter eu illegally ** because it 's literally against founding principles of the eu . 
  so is `` deporting without mercy '' . 
  you 're fine to disagree with those basic fundamental principles but in general such disagreement has to be seen equally anti-eu as being against any other of the articles . 
  again : every single country in the eu knew these principles and agreed to them with minor exceptions and all of them have been in place since at [ least 2009 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lisbon ) . 
  _________ again maybe i 'm too frank here but when multiple parties agree to certain values , then one of the values gets tested and * action * is needed - and some of the partners say : `` oh , right , i forgot , fuck that rule i do n't like it - but i can keep all the good ones right ? '', 
  then that 's not a union , nor a trustworthy party we 're dealing with . 
   - why do you think that french morale would be higher than american one ? 
  not a finn but if there 's one fucking thing european countries * hopefully * learned from our collective history it 's that if one country is in genuine trouble , we 're all in genuine trouble . 
  if poland or finland feels threatened by russia it 's a german or by extent spanish problem . 
  if italy or greece has trouble with their borders it 's the problem of hungary , austria or by extent sweden just the same . 
  whether it 's from an outward aggressor , whether it 's our border control or whether that 's refugees being taken in by any single country they 're * all * collective issues at this point in time . 
  there are very , very few countries on our continent that maybe * could * afford to become more isolationist but at the very least everyone that is connected via [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/european_plain.png ) plain rises and falls together . 
  and at least i do n't plan fixing that by aligning with russian interests . 
   unlike the eu that is still looking for answers party of the `` eu answer '' was france and germany pushing for a stronger frontex which was blocked mostly by two countries : hungary and poland . 
  both of these countries are also part of the voluntary project to help italy there among [ others ] ( http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2014/10/16/frontex-triton-operation-to-support-italys-mare-nostrum_ad334b2e-70ca-44ce-b037-4d461ec0d560.html ) . 
  re : your earlier edit :  edit : some context , as a result of hungary putting up their fence , the flow was directed to my country . 
  but with no eu response , i ca n't really blame them for putting up a fence .
