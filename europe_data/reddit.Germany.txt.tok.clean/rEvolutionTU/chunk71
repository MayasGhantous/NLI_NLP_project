  and yes , i still find it completely understandable if others do so if someone spews that kind of bullshit . 
  it 's okay , at least rape is legal in germany now . 
  ( no , it 's not . ), 
  to be fair it happened within the [ last few weeks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election%2c_2017.png ) because of the primary . 
   `` i was n't speaking for myself , but for a hypothetical person '' let me quote myself :  bullshit . 
  ** people call people nazis ** because they 're uttering opinions like this and try to hide them behind : `` i 'm just suggesting reasonable immigration policies !, 
  but those against me sympathize with the raf !!, 
  we need to do something !!!, 
  europe awaken !!!, 
  do n't be afraid of being called a nazi !!!!, 
  ! 11 '' yeah , right . 
  i told you this multiple times by the way . 
  it 's you who kept trying to present it as a comment i made because nothing else could exist in your reality . 
  analogue wanting to embrace diversity while being fiercely against islamists and radical preachers ca n't exist in your reality . 
  sucks , but sometimes people are just so stuck in their ideology that they ca n't see anything else . 
  * official * and 100 % confirmed results will come out on wednesday if i understand correctly . 
  give it overnight and it should be rather accurate already i 'd assume . 
  the hamon/m \u00e9lenchon camp splitting voters hurts a * lot * i imagine . 
   and now you 're going to claim that this discussion is n't about you calling somebody a nazi ? 
  you know that i can just scroll up and read the whole thing , right ? 
  never was . 
  it was about me saying that it 's understandable that others call the poster i was talking about a nazi . 
  but i 'm sure you would never confuse those two things . 
  for those who missed it in the top comment : * for italian speakers : [ la7 ] ( http://la7.it/ ) * for german speakers : [ phoenix ] ( http://www.phoenix.de/livestream/ ), 
   you want diversity , you need to get used to hate preaching mosques , because those are the people intentionally filling europe . 
  i am pro diversity and against hate preaching imams . 
  i 'm pretty sure i said that . 
   your use of the term nazi is childish , a simplistic tactic pursued for simple reasons . 
  when did i use the term nazi for anyone ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i elaborated on that . 
   you tried in vain , because i 'm not the one failing to understand , i 'm failing to accept your justifications . 
  i tried in vain because some people just do n't want to understand the positions of others . 
  shit happens eh . 
   by comparison die linke seems still a bit ... archaic ? 
  yeah ... 
  i elaborated a bit more [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67112y/the_bundeswehr_can_only_use_30_to_70_percent_of/dgmy0ga/ ) but from my point of view they tend to represent a from reality detached intellectual left more than anything else . 
  what i do n't appreciate about m\u00e9lenchon is that he sounds a bit too nationalistic left for my taste if that makes sense . 
  on top of that [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-luc_m%c3%a9lenchon#anti-german_sentiment ) kind of comments , especially the historical revisionism with regards to the german reunification and i 'm overall a bit skeptical . 
  [ this here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bn9zrj3nbs ) is german expansionism according to his quote - a * literal * example of people rising against an oppressive socialist regime to be united with people from the same country . 
  * slightly * triggering to say the least . 
   general xenophobia that 's quite a lot of it . 
  =p their main leadership ( who already was right but tried to save face at least ) was basically put down a few days ago in favor of people yelling : `` we will never form coalitions with any of these traitors to our fatherland !!!, 
  we are true patriots !! '', 
  over here ( at least until last week ) they tried to present classic left and center policies as their main goals to hide the actual far-right ideas . 
   hoping for our german bros to elect schulz too - a macron / schulz duo would be great for the eu . 
  the second he pulls the trigger on keeping our * the left * out of a potential coalition i 'm all game . 
  that 's a quote from the exact same person [ [ source ] ( http://de.reuters.com/article/deutschland-usa-nato-iddekbn16y1bc ) ] . 
  what makes you sure that one of them is more true than the other ? 
  fact remains that there was no official confirmation for the invoice ever existing . 
  from that point of view `` made up story '' might be too far but `` completely unconfirmed story '' is still pretty damn accurate . 
  ... but it 's the french election . 
  ours will probably be the most boring out of the major ones tbh . 
  you and me know that , but a rather vocal crowd on reddit pretended some form of a clear majority is actually a possibility . 
  but yeah , i get what you 're saying . 
  [ this happened ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election%2c_2017.png ) . 
  note hamon vs. m\u00e9lenchon right after the social democrat primary . 
  no source ? 
  not even an actual quote that i could google ? 
  i thought the dutch already did that ? 
  not `` results '' , most likely exit polls and not representative in the bigger picture . 
  e : downvoting myself in shame , see below . 
   the reports about such an invoice are not true . 
  there is no debt account with nato . 
  the confirmation that such an invoice was presented does not exist , unless you choose to interpret the above as such . 
  please , everyone knows the [ complete military history of france ] ( http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/france.html ) at this point . 
  man is that thing old now . 
  tbh despite some downsides i also really like what 's basically a media blackout till 2000 and the no-postal votes in general . 
  it 's from the same `` the times of london '' that made up the invoice story . 
  [ source ] ( http://globalnews.ca/news/3340159/donald-trump-angela-merkel-nato-bill-fake-news/ ) for that one . 
  so ... yeah . 
  the `` this was * so smart and helpful * '' triggered me . 
  my bad . 
  from an exclusively american perspective that makes total sense . 
  bit like how merkel and her party are frequently described as `` center-left '' by certain groups . 
  [ pheme ] ( https://www.pheme.eu/ ) [ euvsdisinfo ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ ) [ eu myths ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) look at all these eu propaganda outlets , some of them even dare to * correct or point out false records * . 
  putting germany into a clear neoliberal category is a bit thin too because of the whole [ social market economy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_market_economy ) thing . 
  either that , or i 'm understanding the term neoliberal wrong . 
  i 'm understanding it as laissez-faire economic liberalism . 
   which candidate would make french people in switzerland better drivers ? 
  ... le pen might be most likely to build a wall around france ? 
  2h from now ( 1800 utc , 2000 local ) is when french sources will release the first results . 
  sanity restored . 
  all is right in the world . 
   genetics are a major factor for what you are and how you conduct yourself . 
  denying would be vanity , because we already know about enzymes that dictate how we behave . 
  going from this to `` black people commit more crimes because they 're black '' is a pretty large step do n't you think ? 
  you ca n't just say `` it 's genetics + culture + iq '' when the topic is [ someone making ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/670y8l/how_western_civilisation_could_collapse/dgn2qvu/ ) a slightly different argument . 
   either way , you could always google more about warrior gene , or go to a library , if internet is not credible enough , im sure you will find lots of material , because that is an old discovery , and nice ladies behind the counter will be more than happy to find the right book for you . 
  and you could always learn about this thing called context . 
  i replied to someone making an * exclusive deterministic argument based on their race * which he later goes on to defend . 
  you come in and make a completely different argument which is not something i argued against in the first place . 
  ... speaking of which did you get your cheque for this weekend yet ? 
  i tried calling earlier but they 're saying there are delays because of the sheer amount of people out in the field . 
  you know you can mouse over the time of the post and go from there , right ? 
  i could have also said `` 2000 local 1800 utc '' - then you 'd have to look for a converter if you 're not 100 % sure what utc is in relation to your own timezone . 
  lose-lose everywhere , i 'm sorry . 
  yes , so if it 's a larger grain of salt you should take it even less seriously . 
  you 're making me doubt my sanity here . 
  this . 
  or to say it super cheesy : without a strong and united europe europeans are destined to be pawns of bigger powers .
