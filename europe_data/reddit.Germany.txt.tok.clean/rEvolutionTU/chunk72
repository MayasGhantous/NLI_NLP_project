  because one of those things is something an individual can change , the other is n't . 
  hence why we call one version of that racist . 
  is ... that how that saying works ? 
  i 'd assume that `` taking it with massive grains of salt '' is a comparative to `` taking it with a grain of salt '' . 
  was i an idiot ? 
   there are enzymes responsible for aggression , compassion , empathy , apathy , everything . 
  they are not spread equally between races , because races evolved in different parts of the world . 
  and you believe those genetic differences are why e.g. 
  black , chinese and maori people commit more crime ? 
  or just black people ? 
  or both caucasians and blacks compared to asians ? 
  do you have an actual source for * that * kind of claim or did you just want to support the argument that some people commit more crime because it 's in their dna to do so ? 
  pretty much . 
  the eu and the basic idea of it is what ensured peace in europe for a longer time than most people are alive . 
  a rise in nationalism and a potential collapse is a massive threat to that idea of peace . 
   it 's a frexit attempt by le pen , but if they go too left , then it 's an exit attempt by m\u00e9lenchon . 
  despite all the not-so-cool things i learned about melenchon lately i 'd not frame it that way . 
  where le pen is openly for a frexit melenchon says he wants it ** if his ideas for reform are not possible ** . 
  those are pretty different approaches . 
  yup , french media wo n't release anything before 2000 , everything before then has to be taken with massive grains of salt . 
  i 'm all for respecting the french system here and being extremely careful with anything released before that time . 
  2000 local time , that 's 3\u00a01/2 hours from this post . 
  before then french media is not allowed to release polls or preliminary results , so all you will get before then are secondary sources from e.g. 
  belgium or switzerland . 
  someone else will have to chime in as for how accurate those are historically . 
  the official result will be proclaimed on wednesday but we should have a reasonable idea before then . 
  what do * you * believe is the reason for that ? 
   what does germany need a bigger military for ? 
  we famously said `` no '' in all recent wars with the exception of intel missions . 
  would you say that is a bad thing ? 
  no , that 's a good thing and i 'd like that to continue . 
  * however * i 'm a firm believer in the idea that the eu needs a unified military eventually and germany , as one of the strongest nations in the eu , should lead by example there . 
  i think it 's hypocritical to push for that level of unification while your own army is in shambles at times . 
  to me the eu in the long run is unsustainable if countries do n't work together to both take full responsibility of borders and to also represent the eu outwards - which includes a proper modern military . 
  basically i consider an at least somewhat decent german military just a stepping stone towards an actual co-operative eu military . 
   the past couple of years the book came out in 2015 tho . 
  :3 while i think the insults are out of line and unacceptable it 's the historical revisionism regarding germany * annexing * the gdr that actually pisses me off a lot more . 
  like , seriously . 
  a population was split in half for half a century and reunification is a sign of expansionism ? 
  the fall of the berlin wall was * literally * [ the will of the people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peaceful_revolution ) in action . 
  but no , clearly the videos of [ demonstrations ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nktan7ptac ) or [ people flooding ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bn9zrj3nbs ) into west germany are an example of german expansionism . 
  triggered . 
  please tell me he 'd not be too bad ? 
  i understand your general point and agree that this is an issue but i feel like you 're picking a weird spot here to make a stand . 
  if / u/azure _ dawn would have said '' * seems * like a dead end '' his post would have been completely fine . 
  based on his history and context ( him wanting to get an answer on the latter question because in his mind his economic policy is a dead end ) i 'd not lump him in with the haha pls get into power so this fails lol socialism crowd that 's all over this thread . 
  maybe i 'm naive here but i think if you had explained to him why you think this is not just viable but necessary he might have just agreed . 
   the backup should that fail is unilateral withdrawal it definitely does sound a bit like blackmail here and there . 
  even for someone being into reforms that might not be the smartest course . 
  checking through his [ wikipage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jean-luc_m%c3%a9lenchon#anti-german_sentiment ) , did he really refer to the german reunification as an * annexation * and example of german expansionism ? 
  i 'm not even sure what to say to that . . 
   that being said i think that german left is taking this a bit too far . 
  putting ones head in the sand and pretending that we 're over wars and there is no need to have armies is silly at best and criminally counterproductive at worst . 
  agreed . 
  just to be clear on this though , we 're not talking about the german left * in general * . 
  it 's literally a party called [ `` the left '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_left_ ( germany \\ ) #ideology ) that openly advocates for this kind of nonsense . 
   just like the stupid reasoning of internal security , when it is the conservatives that cut police funding over and over again . 
  i pretty distinctly remember that states like bavaria have much larger police force than those ruled by left coalitions . 
  it 's overall more of a west/east divide though . 
  e :  odd reasoning , considering that the conservatives had a hold on this ministry for quite some time now and are responsible for many many fuck ups in that area . 
  definitely true !, 
  it 's just that * the left * actively aims to make it much , much worse . 
  i would n't mind spd by themselves having a shot at it however . 
   defensively nuke russian troops in poland . 
  you ... what ? 
  also rather fitting username for what comes below . 
  they also tend to rack up rather high bodycounts before realizing they 're not some form of gods gift to humanity which will lead their people to some promised land . 
  i 'd prefer someone who 's not into war over someone who is bad at it personally . 
  i actually enjoyed the article as a whole , can only recommend those skimming to the comments to read it themselves . 
  multiple angles being able to cherrypick usually makes for an interesting read . 
  e : / r/europe pls . 
  why is this guy eating downvotes for asking a not even terrible question while i 'm getting upvotes for an attempt at answering it . 
  without his question , no answer . 
  we 're * both * actively contributing to the discussion . 
  : / _____ i think it 's even a bit worse than leftist peace mongering . 
  the following is my * personal * view and it 's possible that i 'm fucking up somewhere , so take it with a grain of salt . 
  maybe someone who is more involved with them can shed some different angle on their backgrounds . 
  & nbsp ; first of all the german [ the left ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_left_ ( germany \\ ) ) is a result of the [ pds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/party_of_democratic_socialism_ ( germany \\ ) ) which is a successor to the gdr party [ sed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_unity_party_of_germany ) . 
  basically from my view * die linke * always had a massive identity conflict . 
  they want to represent the far-left ( remember the german communist party is banned ) without associating themselves with the stone-throwing antifa . 
  i 'd consider them a type of intellectual left that believes in an ideal society . 
  to get to that ideal society they 're convinced that to lead the world to such a place germany has to make initial drastic steps and lead by example , e.g. 
  demilitarization . 
  for example they 'd like to get rid of nato and replace it with an international security organization that includes russia . 
  they see germanys role as a completely non-violent side that mediates in conflicts with communication and diplomacy . 
  ** in a vacuum ** i think a lot of these are noble ideas and chains of thoughts . 
  however , when i look at the real world half of those ideas seem batshit insane and do n't outweigh the ones i consider realistic . 
  also note that they 're usually around 10 % in major elections so they 're pretty much as fringe as the right-wing afd . 
   whether in the us , uk or elsewhere , the more dissatisfied and afraid people become , homer-dixon says , the more of a tendency they have to cling to their in-group identity -- whether religious , racial or national . 
  ^ there you missed that sentence that was written before your quote to explain what you 're about to do . 
  but sure , instead argue that black people are criminals because they 're black . 
  changing from the article to the comment section has certainly made me wonder if i misclicked somewhere . 
  to quote the article :  whether in the us , uk or elsewhere , the more dissatisfied and afraid people become , homer-dixon says , the more of a tendency they have to cling to their in-group identity -- whether religious , racial or national . 
  denial , including of the emerging prospect of societal collapse itself , will be widespread , as will rejection of evidence-based fact . 
  if people admit that problems exist at all , they will assign blame for those problems to everyone outside of their in-group , building up resentment . 
  case in point : berlin airport . 
  jokes aside , that shit is ridiculous and needs to be addressed . 
  also , at least for me personally , one of the reasons to not even consider voting on the left side of the spectrum in the upcoming election unless someone from our main left-centre option steps up and excludes our far left from coalitions . 
  i really do n't want a party to be part of a ruling coalition who openly advocates for * less * military spending while also being against some form of an eu military . 
  man , i envy france for having a left that at least to an outsider seems to have its shit together to at least * some * degree .
