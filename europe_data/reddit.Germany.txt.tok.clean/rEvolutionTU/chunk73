  correct . 
  to stick with memes building a wall around your country and aiming to decrease communication with the outside is a sign of nationalism just like building bridges ( ha ! ), 
  and increasing communication with the outside is a sign of globalism . 
   globalism has brought inequalities unseen for a century , demographic upheaval , cultural disruption , and democratic deficits . 
   to name one example ; the death of the middle-class is a feature of globalization , not a bug . 
  globalism is a predatory ideology . 
  it preys on the nation state and the pillars of traditional society . 
  i 'm ... pretty sure you misspelled `` capitalism '' here . 
  then those sentences make perfect sense . 
  to be frank i 'm not well informed on his actual policies or decisions he is responsible for . 
  his twitter seems a bit too ... 
  the german word ` linksgr\u00fcnversifft ' ( ~ left-green-grubby ) seems appropriate to me . 
  a bit too happy and optimistic for my view . 
  ** but ** i neither see him pushing a safe haven narrative nor do i see an existential crisis with regards to the eu from some angle of diversity . 
  i obviously ca n't speak for france or other nations but over here our right-wing is very easily a bigger threat to our way of life than refugees or migrants in general . 
  melenchon at least is n't outright saying he 's against the eu , unlike le pen . 
  macron & fillon are the ones clearly pro-eu . 
  le pen is clearly anti-eu . 
  melenchon has the whole `` i want reforms and if i do n't get them i 'll consider frexit blackmail '' angle . 
  also le pen is the one * actually * linked to russia and russian money . 
  in order of `` who is the least threatening to the eu ? '', 
  i 'd say it 's clearly macron  fillon  melenchon  le pen . 
  `` dangerous to poland '' is difficult to say depending on whether you prioritize getting eu money or prioritize having complete autonomy over migration policies from my understanding . 
  that 's a topic i 'm completely uninformed on to be frank . 
  is school not mandatory for kids in finland ? 
  is that a german thing ? 
  i actually have no idea how other eu countries handle this . 
  here parents who do n't ensure their kids go to school can get hit with fines or actual prison time in extreme cases . 
  kids can get brought to school with police pretty much dragging them there . 
  there is no antifa or salafist party in germany and as far as i know they 're not classified as terror organisations either . 
  hence the whole freedom of expression thing applies where people are judged by their actions as individuals . 
   what do you mean calls to accept diversity have nothing to do with hate preaching mosques ? 
  it 's the same topic !, 
  why is it so hard to understand that you 're talking to someone who can without any issue whatsoever say that diversity is an amazing thing while also arguing against hate preaching mosques ? 
  in this very thread i talked about [ considering ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66vf12/salafists_seize_power_in_amsterdam_mosques_dutch/dglnb28/ ) radical islamists a threat to diversity . 
  because that 's what they are . 
  those ideas are n't polar opposites . 
  i have literally no idea what timmermans stance is on immigration or refugees or anything of that sort is . 
  i ca n't make an assumption on these stances simply because he says : `` let 's embrace diversity ! '', 
  that 's the whole point i 've maybe terribly been trying to make this entire time . 
  i can love diversity , feel that immigration is a threat to it and be completely against immigration whatsoever . 
  i can also hate diversity and that can be a reason for me to be against immigration . 
  i can also love diversity and want completely open borders because of that or some similar bullshit . 
  there 's dozens of permutations among these positions . 
  i for example love diversity and think it 's the most amazing thing humanity has going for it . 
  i 'd also love quotas on immigration , support e.g. 
  fingerprint databases for migrants and would love to see an eu wide program that ensures people who commit multiple crimes get kicked the hell out and ca n't easily come back in . 
  i have literally the same disgust for left - , right - or religious extremists of any denomination . 
  the guy pretended that merely by uttering `` let 's embrace diversity '' in a completely different ( unknown ) context a person would pick `` sacrificing european values '' vs `` giving in to radical islam '' if being put to the choice . 
  that 's a completely moronic conclusion . 
  a conclusion of the kind that i 've almost exclusively seen from far-right people * because * it is so nonsensical and just aims to paint someone as a traitor with a sentence that 's not related to the topic at hand . 
  * `` look , this guy said diversity is good so he 's a traitor to our values and would sacrifice them in favor of radical islamists !!, 
  - i really do n't understand why people call me a nazi when i 'm making completely reasonable points !, 
  ____ i rarely do this but i tried . 
  if you really still ca n't see why i believe it 's completely understandable that anyone calls someone with that perspective a nazi ( note that i 've never done this myself btw but i * can * completely understand the association - i 'd just call it right-wing extreme instead ) - i 'm out of ideas . 
  i absolutely do n't know how to make myself more understandable at this point . 
   and you do n't think that timmerman 's comments are cast in a negative light by the article under which we are talking about ? 
  timmerman 's comment had nothing to do with the article or the topic at hand . 
  the user took it , posted it ** as if ** it 's a statement relevant to this topic ( or even made in relation to it ) and used it to justify his agenda of `` someone who says diversity is good wants to sacrifice european values '' . 
  he 's * literally * taking something out of context just to call someone a traitor . 
  that 's not normal political discourse . 
  it 's not normal for conservatives to say : `` this guy disagrees with my opinion , he 's betraying our cultural values !!, 
  ! 11 '' someone should not in the slightest be surprised if he gets called some form of right-wing extremist for such a ridiculous statement . 
   they mentioned that diversity is a good thing in the context of an article about deadly hate preaching in mosques . 
  the person in question [ brought up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66vf12/salafists_seize_power_in_amsterdam_mosques_dutch/dglmhv5/ ) a recently made tweet of frans timmermans which was not made in context of anything related to immigrants or muslims . 
  he then * pretended * it 's relevant here because it mentions diversity and used it as an example of this person wanting to sacrifice european values . 
   requiring a reevaluation of how the nation deals with immigrant culture ? 
  who the hell talked about immigrants ? 
  the topic is someone calling people traitors to european values because they dared mentioning that they believe diversity is a good thing in general . 
  welp , bit hard to verify now but i 'll keep it in mind for the future . 
   `` europe should not allow muslim immigrants '' i 'm pretty sure that 's not what i called out , why would such a statement not be acceptable ? 
  the person in question said : `` the vice-president of the ec * decided to sacrifice european values and cultural norms * because he said diversity is a good thing '' . 
  that kind of aggressive branding of someone as a traitor for a non-rightwing position on an issue is something i 'm used to almost exclusively from people from the far right . 
  hence it 's not surprising if someone making such a statement gets lumped in with those kind of people . 
   i have and i am not even white . 
   got even banned on r/de for talking about the cologne nye events back when public broadcasting refused to talk about it for a week . 
  what does not being white have to do with anything ? 
  for what kind of comment ? 
  i 'll freely admit that / r/de is rather well , * linksgr\u00fcnversifft * as you may know yourself but at least i personally have n't had any issues with calling for harsher regulations or by taking a clear anti-islamist stance over there . 
  it usually depends a lot on * how * you talk about things . 
   just because the situation offends their values someone who effectively calls people traitors because their opinions are n't right-wing should not be surprised if he 's lumped in with other right-wing extremists who say similar things . 
  that 's not the situation ` offending ' someones values , that 's a statement that should offend anyone 's understanding of a standard political discourse in a modern democracy . 
  i 'm more appalled that you seem to consider that kind of talk perfectly normal and worthy of defending . 
  if i say `` i 'd like to see less turkish immigration to germany '' that 's a reasonable point to make . 
  if i say `` someone said that turks in germany are n't something bad , he 's a traitor to our values ! '', 
  it 's really that simple . 
  talk like someone on that side of the spectrum , be called someone from that side of the spectrum . 
   the best thing he finds to say it 's almost like there are a shitload of tweets on that account , but sure pick the one thing you can find that says `` diversity is a good thing '' and point out he must be a * traitor * . 
  here 's an excerpt of other tweets :  europe is natural habitat 4 the young . 
  my message : do n't take it for granted , it is man made and can be destroyed . 
  you need to become active  this thing , europe , will not maintain itself . 
  it needs to be maintained by its citizens , otherwise it will dissolve . 
   you can not sustain a democracy in a diverse society without respect for minorities / #eudialogues  i passionately believe that europe must give a safe haven to those fleeing war and persecution / #eudialogues  ** but , we ca n't welcome everybody who is looking for a better life and does n't need protection . 
  ** / #eudialogues  around 50 % of roma children do n't have access to education . 
  1/3 go to bed hungry at least once a month . 
  we have to fix it . 
   if your definition of `` talking like a nazi '' is preferring one 's own culture to others , your definiton of nazi covers the majority of human beings on the planet . 
  my definition of `` talking like a nazi '' was very specific . 
  i 'll quote myself :  `` someone who is against diversity is sacrificing european values and social norms '' . 
   that 's plain and simple far-right rhetoric and at least over here in no way shape or form the standard or encouraged by conservatives .
