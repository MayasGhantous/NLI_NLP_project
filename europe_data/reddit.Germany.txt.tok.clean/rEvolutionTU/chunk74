  there 's a difference between a political opinion that aims to create dialogue or find solutions and `` childish simple ways that aim to smear an opponent '' . 
  but sure , pretend it 's about `` preferring one 's own culture to others '' which i called totally fine just a few sentences earlier . 
  [ germans  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_peoples )  the english term germans has historically referred to the german-speaking population of the holy roman empire since the late middle ages . 
  [ 48 ] before the collapse of communism and the reunification of germany in 1990 , germans constituted the largest divided nation in europe by far . 
  [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ note 3 ] ever since the outbreak of the protestant reformation within the holy roman empire , german society has been characterized by a catholic-protestant divide . 
  [ french people  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_people )  french people descend mostly from peoples of latin ( romans , occitans , ligurians ) and celtic origin ( gauls , bretons ) , and peoples of germanic origin ( franks , which is a minority per genetic evidence but whose ethnonym survived to be applied to modern french ) , [ 31 ] france has long been a patchwork of local customs and regional differences , and while most french people speak the french language as their mother tongue , languages like norman , occitan , catalan , auvergnat , corsican , basque , french flemish , franconian and breton remain spoken in some regions . 
  europe ** is ** a diverse melting pot of cultures and has always been in its entire history . 
   second , it is completely consistent with conservative ideology to be against diversity , cultural homogenity is a common thread in conservative movements across the world , especially in muslim nations . 
  that 's totally fine , something i can get behind and something you can find in for example [ german conservative parties ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christian_democratic_union_of_germany#party_platform ) . 
  it 's one thing to say `` i want less diversity/immigrants/harsher regulations '' - it 's a completely different thing to say : `` someone who is against diversity is sacrificing european values and social norms '' . 
  that 's plain and simple far-right rhetoric and at least over here in no way shape or form the standard or encouraged by conservatives . 
  there 's a difference between a political opinion that aims to create dialogue or find solutions and `` childish simple ways that aim to smear an opponent '' . 
  i do n't need to be surprised that someone calls me a nazi when i 'm talking like one . 
   resistance to islam or globalism is put forward which resistance to islam ? 
  which globalism ? 
  we 're talking about diversity , a concept which is at the foundation of europe itself . 
  what ` diversity ' even means in this context is n't established , just the mere mention of the word is enough for this poster to brand the guy a traitor effectively . 
  that is not a conservative position . 
  saying `` this person said ` let 's embrace diversity ' which means he wants to sacrifice european values and cultural norms '' is n't merely ` being a conservative ' . 
  this is n't him `` bringing up a reasonable immigration reduction policy '' . 
  it 's him pointing the finger at a politician and saying : `` he mentioned diversity in a good light he wants to kill our values and society !!, 
  ! 1 '' at least where i 'm from that kinda talk comes from the far-right and not regular old conservatives . 
  sure what would you like me to fix and how ? 
  i 'll get right on it . 
  i understood you more as `` this ( the deportation of imams ) is a thing that exists and these two sentences are wrong but most people do n't know that '' - the point i tried to add was that those sentences are usually from rightwingers anyway and not ` everyday people ' . 
  does that make more sense ? 
  i was referring to the radical right , my bad for not clarifying . 
  thought that part was obvious . 
  guy below is talking crap . 
  in germany the [ nsdap ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_party ) is banned , the [ kpd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_germany ) ( communists ) is banned . 
  what 's not banned is the [ npd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_democratic_party_of_germany ) because ( and this was the official reason in a nutshell ) they 're too small and have no practical way of influencing public opinion with their anti-constitutional ideas . 
  german high-court set a rather high standard for banning a party with that decision . 
  also , obviously but adding it just in case , the is and anyone aiding or associating with it is banned . 
  that says `` shops need to close at 2000 '' so it depends on your definition of ` last minute ' . 
   `` we should deport extremists but we do n't because we 're afraid of being called racists '' and `` muslims should speak against extremism but they do n't '' to be fair these sentences are usually said by actual radicals to push their worldview , even when it differs from reality . 
  you mean like syrian refugees in germany have been disgusted that all they can find here are more conservative imams than they 're used to ? 
  all the issues around it aside , the episode where he takes his sons money away bill after bill to explain to him how much life costs stuck with me ever since . 
  i know you 're getting downvotes across the thread but after watching the video ... how do i know his position is salafist ? 
  what makes it so ? 
  why is salafism seemingly the same as radical islamist if that guy is seen as salafist ? 
  i feel like i 'm missing something here . 
   like doing groceries ? 
  or buy the stuff you did n't have the time for during the week ? 
  that 's something most working people do on saturdays i 'd say if they had no time during the week . 
  doing it either way has advantages and disadvantages , i 've just come to appreciate this way of doing things . 
  most restaurants for example have different days off than the general population - it 's actually rather annoying because there 's rarely overlap in free days with people who work in those areas . 
  opening times in germany are decided on a state level , not federal level . 
  this goes from being open up to 24h per day with 8 sundays per year open for business in berlin all the way to 0600-2000 opening times in bavaria . 
  exceptions exist for specific stores , petrol stations and similar things . 
  [ here ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/laden%c3%b6ffnungszeit#.c3.9cbersicht ) is a full list in german , first three columns are what matters . 
  it becomes even more fun with holidays that only are a thing in e.g. 
  predominantly catholic or predominantly protestant areas . 
  / u/sc3p put it pretty well further up :  the thing is that pretty much everyone has a free day on sundays . 
  want to plan something with your friends ? 
  you can be sure that they have sundays off . 
  want to organize a family event ? 
  sunday is the day where you can expect most people to be free . 
  companies or employees choosing the specific day would make it just another day off where most of the people you know might not be available . 
  also `` choosing '' is often your employee saying that you have to work on that day , because everyone else already took a free day there . 
  for me even though i usually found it annoying , especially when i was younger , i can appreciate it nowadays . 
  it has up - and downsides but in itself it 's not a terrible thing to have the vast majority of people have one day to chill and do stuff with others . 
  i have to admit i 'm not well informed here , but i do recall the [ sorbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbs#contemporary_history ) having some issues in the gdr . 
  early on [ uprisings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uprising_of_1953_in_east_germany ) were also crushed . 
  later in history the [ stasi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stasi ) needs to be mentioned , the `` shield and sword of the party '' , referring to the sed . 
  i 'm a bit suspicious when it comes to one-party-states with basically their own intelligence service and do n't exactly associate that with diversity . 
  =p  one of its main tasks was spying on the population , mainly through a vast network of citizens turned informants , and fighting any opposition by overt and covert measures , including hidden psychological destruction of dissidents . 
  [ that 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_faction ) what i associate with the term , those involved in [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_unity_party_of_germany ) party also come to mind . 
   i 'd like to understand how and why this ` diversity ' rhetoric got pushed and got traction . 
  i think that 's a ( pretty good actually ) question for / r/askhistorians or similar subs . 
  / r/neutralpolitics comes to mind , too for a political background . 
  when i think of embracing diversity i mean that it 's absolutely amazing that i can enjoy french wine , polish vodka , danish chocolate , austrian pumpkin seed oil and a good old kebap all within a day or two if i 'd like to - most of them even from the comfort of my own house . 
  what 's true for food is true for other things as well , i can learn salsa from a cuban , starcraft from a korean , hospitality from someone from iran or eastern europe . 
  individually humans are weak , feeble and pretty fucking useless . 
  as a race we 're strong because we can communicate , work together and specialize . 
  in all aspects this becomes better the more individuals learn how to work together , accept differences and * embrace * them , let them prosper freely . 
  that kind of diversity , that strength through numbers and differences is probably the most amazing thing that can push humanity forward and even though `` celebrating '' is too strong of a word for my good old german potato upbringing - it actually does seem worth of celebration . 
  this is super noticeable in e.g. 
  germany with ~ 3.5 million people of turkish decent total . 
  1.4 million of those were allowed to vote in the referendum ( because they have turkish citizenship ) . 
  ~ 700k voted with ~ 450k votes saying yes . 
  all these statements are true : * 63 % voted `` yes '' in the referendum . 
  * 32 % of eligible voters voted `` yes '' in the referendum . 
  * 13 % of the people of turkish decent voted `` yes '' in the referendum . 
  each of these needs to be evaluated separately and ca n't even be straight up compared to other countries . 
   they were one of the few countries who managed to successfully ban scientology for being a cult . 
  sadly , [ not true ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientology_in_germany ) . 
  it never went to a high enough court and there is currently no clear decision . 
  i * think * the advantage germany has here legally ( which creates issues in other areas ) always goes back to the first article of the constitution being about human dignity and the general sentiment that being intolerant of things that are n't tolerant is integral to the idea of a [ militant democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streitbare_demokratie ) . 
  overall that 's a rather stark contrast to how for example the us approaches these topics which , at least to me , is a much more liberal and optimistic view of things . 
  it 's difficult but if there 's one thing that i personally would like to see as a major german influence on the continent it 's the idea that it 's integral to a strong democracy and to freedom itself that nations are vigilant against those who aim to attack these basic values - no matter which direction these attack are coming from . 
  because `` they '' are afraid of being called nazis ? 
  i find myself making [ multiple ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66vf12/salafists_seize_power_in_amsterdam_mosques_dutch/dglnb28/ ) posts [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66vf12/salafists_seize_power_in_amsterdam_mosques_dutch/dglnfz6/ ) with a clear stance against radical islamism and no one calls me a nazi because i 'm able to distinguish between extremists and regular people like you and me . 
  then [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66vf12/salafists_seize_power_in_amsterdam_mosques_dutch/dglmqe5/ ) happens where someone goes :  inb4 someone says : `` i have never met a person who started squealing about nazism when reasonable immigration reduction policies were brought up in a discussion . '', 
  you can be accused for being a ` nazi ' as soon as you say some organisations in the mediterranean support or facilitate trafficking . 
  they might be not representative for the left , but i have met these kind of people . 
  that 's why i do n't even bring up these kind of topics anymore in any conversation . 
  just nod and move on to the next topic , as playing mine sweeper is even more relaxing . 
  then * in the same fucking thread * [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66vf12/salafists_seize_power_in_amsterdam_mosques_dutch/dglmhv5/ ) post is made by the exact same person :  [ first vice-president of the european commission , frans timmermans , has chosen to pursue plan b ] ( https://twitter.com/timmermanseu/status/855081649083699201 ) ( april 20th , 2017 )  and people wonder why the eu is impopular among a growing group of eu-sceptics . 
  people call people nazis because they 're uttering opinions like this and try to hide them behind : `` i 'm just suggesting reasonable immigration policies !, 
  but those against me sympathize with the raf !!,
