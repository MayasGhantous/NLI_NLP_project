  i mean , sure you 're right we know his words sometimes mean everything and sometimes nothing but that ca n't be the new normal . 
  i 'm having real trouble understanding how you can be so nonchalant about this . 
  we 're talking about the leader of a nation here , someone who represents the american people to the rest of the world . 
  if his words ca n't be taken seriously then how is that even remotely acceptable ? 
  i dunno , this confuses the hell out of me . 
   you mean , due to literally one sentence that some guy said once ( that ambassador to the eu ) . 
  we can dig out lots of things where one absolute was said and turned around some time later . 
  that does n't stand for stability , it 's a more unreliable , volatile way of doing things . 
   europeans are convinced that we are hell-bent on destroying the eu now , and it looks like pure hysteria-especially what we 're seeing from germany . 
  come on , why are you making it `` us '' vs `` them '' already ? 
  i for one am both european and do n't believe that americans are hell-bent on destroying the eu . 
  i * do * however believe the current us government has a vested interest in a weaker eu . 
  we 're seeing this with actions , words and the overall closer alignment to russia . 
   yes , i know trump was rude to merkel , but do n't put yourself on a pedestal-he 's a dick to almost everyone , even australia . 
  is that really what you expect from someone who represents your nation ? 
  is that normal ? 
  is being rude to every fucking stranger you meet the american way of handling these things ? 
  that 's not the us i used to look up to . 
  how is being disrespectful a virtue all of a sudden ? 
   america gets a lot of very deserved criticism , but the european ( especially german ) response to trump has been beyond overboard imo care to name specific examples ? 
  if the leadership of a nation acts overly nationalistic , militaristic , treats politics like a zero-sum game , blames obvious scapegoats for anything that goes wrong and goes back on their words frequently that 's an issue that ca n't deserve enough criticism . 
  been there , done that , seen that path . 
  and that 's just from skimming over two weeks worth of tweets . 
  ** you ** introduced the word `` liar '' in this discussion , not me or the site i referred to . 
  again : saying `` evolution is a theory '' or `` vaccinations kill people '' is also true and ` just a biased representation ' , yet still pretty much a straight up deception if presented without further context . 
  that 's what the hoohaa is about . 
  at least over here [ yes ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xfwwzkl.jpg ) , opinion shifted clearly due to recent developments . 
  what was 60 % trust in november 2016 dropped to 20 % in february 2017 . 
   your `` rt lies '' link which `` rt lies '' ? 
  you mean what is literally titled `` inside rt 's world of alternative news '' ? 
  not everything that is usually referred to fake ad alternative news are lies . 
  the really good stuff is even 100 % true like `` evolution is a theory '' or `` vaccinations kill people '' . 
  that will include what you call `` humorous biased reporting '' all the way to straight up propaganda like for example the mh17 `` the dutch are all liars '' story . 
   what policies have shifted in the us of being pro russia ? 
  have sanctions been lifted or something ? 
  just two quick examples i could find :  `` all transactions and activities otherwise prohibited pursuant to executive order 13694 ... as amended by eo 13757 , are authorised , '' ...  the amended order , announced by the treasury in december 2016 , blocked four additional russian intelligence agents and five entities -- including the fsb -- from obtaining property for use in cyber-attacks against the us . 
  it gave the treasury the authority to determining `` that circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property of a person '' . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-loosens-sanctions-russia-prevent-intelligence-agencies-cyberspying-hacking-a7559871.html )  when asked whether lifting the obama administration 's sanctions on russia would be `` on the table '' during trump 's planned phone call with russian president vladimir putin on saturday , conway said , `` all of that is under consideration . '', 
   `` if another nation that has considerable resources wishes to join together with the united states of america to try to defeat and eradicate radical islamic terrorism , then we 're listening , '' conway said on `` fox and friends . '', 
  `` it 's very important to at least have these conversations . '', 
  [ source ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/trump-sanctions-russia-lift-2017-1?r=us&amp;ir=t ) ...  what altruistic example do you have of the eu ? 
  people in glass houses should n't throw stones . 
  it 's less about altruism in general ( although the us for example has recently cut development funds massively where the eu did not ) , it 's about being consistent with values . 
  what specifically do you mean by `` disney view '' ? 
  that countries and cultures should work together beyond some pure selfish interest to form greater and stronger communities because it 's in the interest of humanity as a whole ? 
  that those in power have a responsibility to care about those with less power ? 
  tweets might not represent policy but leaders of nations need to be held accountable for what they 're saying in public - even if it is via tweets . 
  if you think the words of the us president do n't represent us policy then i do n't really know what to add . 
  could you phrase that as an argument instead of an emotional disconnected outburst ? 
  english is n't my native language so maybe i 'm missing some nuances in what you 're trying to convey on a logical level . 
   that long post was n't mine , fyi . 
  i know i get confused on people i reply to as well . 
   although i disagree completely with the idea that the usa is pro russian . 
  that would be almost impossible to pull off and makes no sense for the usa . 
  as for russia [ this ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/13/rex-tillerson-russia-senate-confirmation-europe ) is from 4 months ago but pretty much the tl ; dr of the tip of the iceberg that i do n't think has changed much . 
  if you put someone who is tight with russia since almost twenty years in such a position than that 's going to raise a few eyebrows at least . 
  not to mention all the pro-nato vs the anti-nato comments over the last few months , the `` pay up '' story that was/is solved since years and similar things . 
  the way it comes across is that the eu is now seen as a bigger threat than russia and rhetoric and policies are shifting accordingly . 
  i think even if you disagree with that perception you should still clearly see a massive shift in tone from the new administration . 
  tagging onto this because it 's kind of a cool sidenote . 
  basically he 's saying that the day before someone bought a large amount ( 60000 ) of put options for this soccer team in frankfurt and finds it odd . 
  `` probably just a coincidence . '', 
  also on the 12th the german channel ard [ wrote a note about this ] ( http://boerse.ard.de/aktien/borussia-aktie-trotzt-dem-terror100.html ) . 
  i 'll let google translate do most of the work :  speculation experiment with bvb-puts  a small conspicuousness from the stock exchange must be mentioned . 
  there are various derivatives that can be used to bet on falling prices of the bvb share . 
  it is striking that yesterday , before the time of the attack , at least two put warrants were bought in frankfurt 's trading , which are otherwise only traded on the stuttgart trading platform euwax , which specializes in private investors . 
  however , both sales were relatively low . 
  there are currently no vacancies [ `` leerverkaufspositionen '' , i think they mean `` short positions '' here ] . 
   the warrants concerned are so much `` out of money '' and show such a high spread that the buyer or buyers are either extremely inexperienced or have expected an extreme downturn . 
  even if the bet was betting on a defeat of the bvb against the as monaco , the chance of significant price gains with these papers would have been very low . 
  sorry , if you did n't intend it this way - to me your post sounded like it was something great america did because it was the right thing and ` muricaaa !!!, 
  and all that . 
  the reason i bring the altruism up in this context is because it 's relevant to events today . 
  without communism , would the us still have invested as much into europe as it did ? 
  we do n't know , but it 's unlikely . 
  i ca n't speak for everyone but i personally was raised in an environment where german-american friendship went past being allies , where the concept of nato went past that . 
  i saw it as more than `` interests align atm and if they do n't anymore go fuck yourselves '' . 
  it was n't so much about * shared interests * but about * shared values * . 
  about liberty , democracy , equality and freedom . 
  now that the us is openly shifting policies to being pro-russian and anti-european that 's a hard pill to swallow with that background . 
  it 's easier however if people understand that the us did n't * just * want peace and prosperity for everyone but always had a deep desire to push its own interests . 
  that is correct and most people i know , including myself , were raised to be appreciative of it . 
  * however * due to a recent volatility in us politics that shifted pretty massively over the last year or so . 
  i 'd go as far and say that it hurts more * because * appreciation for the us was so high . 
  do n't forget that germany went into a war alongside the us where we still debate whether it even was constitutional in the fist place . 
  we can even attribute the rise of merkel at least partially to our centre-left ignoring basic principles to join that war * because * of a loyalty to the us overall . 
  apart from all that , in retrospect , how much of the us pro-eu sentiment was anti-soviet interest ? 
  now that anti-soviet is off the table all of a sudden these things are getting swapped around and that is what pisses people off overall . 
   routinely puts relations with us on the same level as russia at least over here that 's a rather new development due to a certain ... volatility in the american government . 
  as someone who grew up pretty damn appreciative of post-war us politics that was a pretty rough hit . 
  however , i can appreciate all that while still understanding it was n't some selfless act out of the kindness of their hearts . 
  or to put a different emphasis on a quote you just provided :  the american committee on united europe ( acue ) , founded in 1948 , was an american organization ** which sought to counter the communist threat in europe by ** promoting european political integration . 
   i know at least two well educated and intelligent people , in my circles , who belive the russians are doing nothing wrong and all this is just western media propaganda ( `` mh17 where falseflag '' lol ) .
