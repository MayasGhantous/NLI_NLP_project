  here are some cliffnotes of pro-kremlin media , sources can be found in the above link . 
  and before someone asks , [ yes ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/2116/%20questions%20and%20answers%20about%20the%20east%20stratcom%20task%20force ) , the linked site is legit . 
   -- 06.03.2017 : ukraine is preparing shahids ( = term for muslims who have died when fulfilling a religious commandment , especially jihad ) for terror attacks in russia . 
  ukrainian volunteer battalions are the same as moderate syrian opposition and suicide attack terrorists from all middle east . 
  the ukrainian terrorists plan to blow themselves up in the centre of moscow . 
   -- 01.07.2016 : all muslims are terrorists and benefit scroungers . 
  paying welfare benefits for not working and paying benefits on their numerous wives has caused terrorist attacks in paris and brussels . 
   -- 03.07.2016 : isis terrorist ahmed chataev ( isis warlord behind istanbul attacks ) is linked to ukrainian nationalists . 
  last week a project of the [ eu east stratcom ] ( https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/2116/%20questions%20and%20answers%20about%20the%20east%20stratcom%20task%20force ) task force [ released ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/how-pro-kremlin-outlets-abuse-the-tragedy-of-terror/ ) a list of how terror attacks are portrayed in pro-kremlin outlets . 
  [ here ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/inside-rts-world-of-alternative-news/ ) is a massive list of things rt specifically reported . 
  `` subtle '' is something else entirely . 
  ... and in * most * cases where i 've seen eu commissions step in it angered politicians but was in the interest of citizens . 
  in 2015 they for example ( finally ) put restraints on how much more can be spent on the glorious berlin airport project . 
  and that type of shit then gets sold as `` eu fucking up our nice plans stop them '' to constituents . 
  the letter that was released was also rather ridiculous , at least if you read it in german . 
  uncommon phrases used and grammar mistakes made that i 've never seen from non-natives , weird capital spelling and that type of stuff . 
  there 's also an example in gta and [ this ] ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurengensler/2017/02/17/florida-man-charged-target-bomb-scheme-stock-price/#337a5c87584a ) case from february in the us that might have been inspiration . 
  oh , right . 
  all muslims are the same as radicals and run around killing people . 
  my bad , totally forgot that 's what you 're trying to say . 
   does ` we can do it ' and ` refugees welcome ' sound familiar ? 
  yup , see the above links . 
  you disagree with that timelime because it feels wrong , eh ? 
  so you 're into spreading that kind of [ made up story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) again ? 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ftggcy.png ) is a graphical tl ; dr for you . 
  but do n't let reality stop you . 
  that would put those people in the same category as the so-called is . 
  wanting to harm people who are n't violent is totally their thing , too . 
   if you were n't born in france but got your citizenship at a later point , then there 's no issue with me of stripping their french nationality if you are an extremist or commit extreme acts . 
  if they 're committing treason according to french law or join the military forces of another state , sure , that 's reasonable . 
  that 's how the us handles it for example . 
  as for * committing extreme acts * can you list an example of countries who do this ? 
   obviously the situation is different if they were born in france but then again i 'm against the possession of dual passports with other non-european or western countries . 
  ... what does having been born in france to do with dual passports ? 
  as a reminder , you 're arguing for `` sending back dangerous individuals , even if they have a european passport '' with no mention of nationality or place of birth . 
  i did n't say they 're oppressed as of now . 
  i 'm saying that by asking for oppression and attacks you 're encouraging more people to see violence as a reasonable last resort . 
  did you know that the [ de-ba ` athification ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de-ba'athification#impact ) in iraq affected 500k soldiers apart from tens of thousands of regular people in all kinds of professions ? 
  all of which were now without jobs and excluded from the political process . 
  this happened from 2003 onwards . 
  if you now look into the [ history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#history ) of the daesh or even more specifically a predecessor the so-called [ islamic state of iraq ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq ) that timeframe might be put into relation . 
  it 's very , very reasonable to say that the de-ba ` athification and hence the war in iraq was the direct cause of the so-called is we 're facing today . 
  `` so-called islamic state '' is something people say because it adds that you do n't recognize it as a rightful state - by calling it a straight up * state * you give the whole ordeal legitimacy from my perspective . 
  apart from that have you ever heard of oppressed and attacked minorities becoming more violent than non-oppressed minorities ? 
  that 's what i 'm referring to . 
  are you seriously asking why i oppose kicking citizens out of a country ? 
  what is ` back ' in the first place when they 're natives for example ? 
  i 'll try to rephrase , maybe i 'm explaining myself wrong . 
  at least here the parties that stand for anti-immigration or straight up kicking people out en masse out are the exact same people that were against polish immigrants ten years earlier . 
  they 're the exact same people who were loudly against the whole eu east deal in 2007 . 
  their logic : they 're not us , without them we 'd be better off , fuck them . 
  that 's why i keep trying to point at the similarities between what you 're advocating as some kind of solution to the current issue and what our far right has been advocating since decades when it comes to eastern europeans . 
  it 's the exact same basic rhetoric that i 'm now hearing from you for example , just with regards to muslims . 
  i can want harsh positions on islamists , islamic terrorism and criminal migrants while also being accepting of people like you and me just with a different skin color or religion . 
  the whole debate is completely nonsensical if we do n't differentiate between shitty and not-shitty people . 
  i 'd not be surprised if it 's the whole strong rhetoric that 's attractive with macron , but yeah it does seem a bit odd at first glance . 
   the most pro-eu candidate , and from the least liberal candidate to the most liberal candidate melenchon is n't the most pro-eu candidate ( that 'd be macron/hamon/fillon even ) . 
  he 's the one saying he wants an eu reform but still says he 's considering an exit if those do n't happen . 
  he also , at least to me as an outsider , sounds more like a left nationalist overall than a classic socialist . 
  if i 'm wrong on any of this i hope some frenchman smacks me for it . 
  it 's fine , i just find myself arguing with people i agree with when it comes to concrete examples way too often . 
  all good , i might just be too edgy . 
  i 'm sure countries like germany or france ( or the eu as a whole ) have political ways of pressuring e.g. 
  tunisia to speed up their process of finding the appropriate papers in the half year before someone drives a truck over people instead of the day after . 
  agreed . 
  fuck that shit . 
  over here our crime stats for 2016 came out a few days ago . 
  rough tl ; dr is migrant crime went up by 100 % in some states , 60-80 % of all of it is migrant on migrant crime ( meaning migrant vs native crime went down overall ) and in one state for example 600 people are responsible for 7000 criminal offenses . 
  that type of shit needs to dealt with harshly , * especially * because it reflects so terribly on those who are n't involved but still put in similar categories . 
  we 're pretty much in the same boat overall i 'd say . 
  well , good that your initial perception was that i 'm some left-extreme hippy who wants open borders and as much immigration as i can get . 
  i 'm actually genuinely sad that hamon is basically out . 
  as an outsider , i liked that guy . 
  you 're right , they 're not the same and you did n't talk about the eu specifically , my bad . 
  in this case we 're only talking about 30 years of history down the drain - maybe 50 if you consider the french-german border specifically . 
   we 're talking about islamic terrorism , and we both agree that the hypothesis is correct . 
  do you also agree with the one about poles ? 
  there are one and the same hypothesis . 
  without any muslim immigrants there would be no islamic terrorism and without polish immigrants there would be no crime committed by poles . 
  based on that i 'm saying they 're both true but still completely ridiculous to make in the first place . 
  they 're not a reasonable approach to the situation because they 're letting the actions of very few dictate how we treat the entire group . 
   nevertheless , i would n't mind if it was to happen . 
  it would be beneficial to my country . 
  here however you 're completely delusional . 
  poland is [ * the * ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mycountry/pl/index_en.cfm ) biggest beneficiary of eu funds . 
  roughly 5 % of gdp to be precise . 
  this is true for a total of 10 years now by the way . 
  and that 's * fine * because by joining the eu that tolerant and open west you rant against decided that 's the right thing to do . 
  but then turning around and not wanting the same thing extended to people because of their religion * after * gladly taking money for almost a decade is pretty damn shitty to say the least . 
  leaving the eu does . 
  countries like the benelux states , france or germany have been working on this since 1957 . 
   they do n't want more muslim recruits do n't take my word for it [ read around actual sources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#purpose_and_strategy ) . 
  the idea that hatred against muslims is great for the so-called is because it brings in fresh recruits easier is n't something new or uncommon . 
  we also know it works . 
   i think france needs to get out of s ** c ** hengen . 
  sure , throwing 60 years of post-ww2 history down the drain is clearly the most sensible solution to this kind of issue . 
   why are you bringing eastern europeans into the equation ? 
  because you did so :  ** poland is often viewed as very intolerant and hateful in the eyes of western europeans , yet we have zero terrorist attacks ** , while the oh-so-tolerant and open west are under nonstop attack . 
  i totally agree that your statement is true . 
  i 'm just adding that if we 'd go by that rule then life for a lot of people , including in your own country , would suck a lot more .
