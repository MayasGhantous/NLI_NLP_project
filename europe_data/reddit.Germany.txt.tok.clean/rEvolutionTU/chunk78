   wilders , sure . 
  marine le pen , less . 
  i 'd agree in general if it was n't for some of her talks . 
  if someone wants to ban all religious clothing and adds `` of course that means turbans , it 's a good thing we do n't have many sikhs here ! '', 
  then , yeahhhh ... not so sure anymore . 
  what 's missing to me is a party that openly represents zero tolerance towards non-cooperative governments , low tolerance towards repeating offenders but still lots of tolerance towards regular people like you and me just with a different background or skin colour . 
  what makes this all so damn awkward is that at least over here most cases would be solved by pushing our existing laws and cooperating properly . 
  amri to me was kind of a great example here but clearly we need to tolerate a foreign government losing papers when it comes to his deportation . 
  all i want for christmas is basically zero tolerance for that kind of crap from foreign governments , zero tolerance for repeating offenders but still lots of tolerance for regular people like you and me just with a different background . 
  sigh . 
  :( also sorry for being a dick initially , i thought the polarizing thing is well-established by now that you 're just being an ass about it . 
  my bad . 
   sending back dangerous individuals , even if they have a european passport username checks out . 
  if it did n't come with the `` close borders get rid of muslims fuck all refugees '' story i 'd vote for that in a heartbeat . 
  if the viewpoint of your comment would be that of the majority of people we 'd not have any polish immigrants in germany and no eastern europe in the eu . 
  i 'm * pretty * sure that 's relevant when you bring up `` it 's so much better to have fewer migrants if you have any problems with them '' . 
   but i still doubt that somewhere in northern iraq their leadership is discussing how to make france elect le pen . 
  they polarize , but i do n't think they have goals which are so specific as to which politician is elected . 
  i agree there in general , especially since there is less and less evidence for a central command structure lately . 
  overall it 's just the nature of the polarizing thing . 
  whoever is most likely to actually be harsh on regular muslims will be the candidate that people will gravitate towards if terror attacks go up . 
  what annoys me personally is that no one is campaigning on reasonable policies to deal with the whole thing . 
  there 's definitely some failure on regular parties here that ca n't be denied . 
  me , personally ? 
  * a registry of all criminally offending migrants that keeps e.g. 
  fingerprints for 3-5 years . 
  * strong pressure on countries to take back all serial criminals . 
  a case like amri is a complete disgrace . 
  * an eu wide sharing of these decisions and registries so other countries do n't have the same issues again . 
  in cases where we consider it inhumane to deport to ( because of e.g. 
  active war zones ) i 'd rather see the people sit in our jails with tries at rehabilitation than be sent back , but i can see that being up for debate unlike the other points so far . 
  on top of all that stronger integration programs , especially places with a lot of asylum seekers on top of each other need to be rethought and changed up . 
  being harsh against those who seek to dismantle our society is in all our interest , * especially * in the interest of those who are genuinely in need of help . 
  you could form a party that supports the death penalty by burning and let the people vote on it !, 
   they want to enforce the conservative view of the quran , therefore they also kill a lot of muslims who are more liberal and not so strict . 
  and they need islamist mosques to spread the conservative islam . 
  i 'm fully on board with being aggressive against these things . 
  i do n't see it as being at odds with being understanding and tolerant towards regular muslims in general however . 
  * especially * the reformists and more liberal ones need all the help they can get from us . 
  fight back against radicals by all means . 
  deport those who commit crimes whenever possible . 
  at the same time be understanding of those who agree with basic values and support reformists . 
  it 's really not that hard to differentiate between radicals and `` regular '' people like you and me . 
   unlike the oh-so-tolerant and open west . 
  you do realize that the exact same people who want `` fewer of them '' are the exact same people that used to tell me we should kick out all these polish immigrants because they commit so much crime , steal jobs and are overall bad for our nation ? 
  they 're also the same who usually talk about how retarded it is to invest money in these eastern european countries . 
  but , yeah , i agree it would have been more * effective * to not have any immigrants from anywhere . 
  * defending * is completely fine . 
  the so-called is needs to be fought . 
  there 's just the whole angle about quite a few people making this about a lot of people who are * not * involved in any of this type of shit . 
  minorities tend to be more interested in violent reactions when they 're oppressed and attacked compared to when they 're not . 
  there 's nothing contemptuous about being empathetic to that general concept . 
   why not make non-radicals afraid to become recruits i think that 's totally reasonable approach . 
  it 's just these things tend to come along with being rough to regular people . 
  also i 'd lay off the burning pig blood and all that . 
  i think we agreed to stop that kind of shit a while back . 
  honestly , if she sticks to those kind of policies and does n't go further like some of her speeches sound like - sure , i can see that . 
  it 's just doubtful that 's what 's going to happen based on her history and the history of her party . 
  either way , if crackdowns on muslims and a strong right-wing is in my interest she 's the best possible candidate . 
  otherwise this would be the perfect time to lay off the terrorism and wait till after the elections , do n't you agree ? 
  we quite literally [ know ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#purpose_and_strategy ) that this is the declared goal : the less safe non-radicals feel the more likely are they to become easy fresh recruits . 
  you 're free to look into the [ goals and strategies of is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#purpose_and_strategy ) with dozens of sources . 
  if they can get someone who can make non-radical muslims feel less safe then that 's as good as it gets . 
   its efforts to terrorise are intended to intimidate civilian populations and force governments of the target enemy `` to make rash decisions that they otherwise would not choose '' . 
   it aims to mobilise its supporters by motivating them with , for example , spectacular deadly attacks deep in western territory ( such as the november 2015 paris attacks ) , to polarise by driving muslim populations -- particularly in the west -- away from their governments , thus increasing the appeal of isil 's self-proclaimed caliphate among them , and to : `` eliminate neutral parties through either absorption or elimination '' . 
  the goal of radical islamists is ** more ** violence and hatred towards regular muslims , not less . 
  that is what brings in recruits . 
  le pen is the best possible candidate to achieve this . 
  agreed , if i was a radical islamist in france i 'd vote for her in a heartbeat . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#purpose_and_strategy ) has you covered with lots of sources . 
  it 's pretty much the only reasonable view . 
  does [ wikipedia suffice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_state_of_iraq_and_the_levant#purpose_and_strategy ) ? 
   it aims to mobilise its supporters by motivating them with , for example , spectacular deadly attacks deep in western territory ( such as the november 2015 paris attacks ) , to polarise by driving muslim populations -- particularly in the west -- away from their governments , thus increasing the appeal of isil 's self-proclaimed caliphate among them , and to : `` eliminate neutral parties through either absorption or elimination '' . 
  [ 124 ] [ 126 ] journalist rukmini maria callimachi also emphasises isil 's interest in polarization or in eliminating what it calls the `` grey zone '' between the black ( non-muslims ) and white ( isil ) . 
  `` the gray is moderate muslims who are living in the west and are happy and feel engaged in the society here . '', 
   that commiting or attempting to commit terrorist attack will only increase the hate towards your minority/group . 
  this in turn will only increase the public support for severe measures against your minority/group . 
  that is exactly the goal . 
  terror attacks -  more and more severe reaction -  hatred towards minority groups -  more recruits . 
  everything that helps the far-right helps radicals and the other way around . 
  mhm . 
  to me the underlying principle of gay marriage comes back to the rights of consenting adults being able to do what everyone else is able to do . 
  sure , it 's something else as in that its about more than two people . 
  but it 's also just the same as it comes down to laws preventing people from being as happy as everyone else when they 're adults , consenting and not doing anything harmful to society . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4au611/chancellor_merkels_invitation_in_the_refugee/ ) thread from should shed some light on it . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ftggcy.png ) timeline is kind of a good tl ; dr. 
   only very few went from voting spd to afd . 
  if you look at * [ all other state elections ] ( http://blog.tagesschau.de/2016/09/04/struktur-der-afd-waehlerschaft/ ) * except for the one you 're referring to afd gained almost as much from left/green/spd as from cdu/fdp . 
  the left party especially lost the most voters to the afd proportionally . 
  there 's a vast block of afd voters which are n't people who consider the cdu too far left - part of that block is what they 're currently losing in polls because they 're incapable of hiding the far-right people in the party . 
   civil marriage is an administrative contract between two consenting adults . 
  i 'd like to have an administrative contract between multiple consenting adults . 
  why am i getting fucked ? 
  or rather , why am i being forced to only have an administrative contract with one person that i 'm fucking ? 
  tagging on here because [ these ] ( https://youtu.be/hkzir1l7fsy?t=673 ) quotes from john olivers video are also pretty good . 
  what a good thing they do n't have many sikh in france !, 
   both trump and erdogan won thanks to the conservative population . 
  you do n't think erdogans victory had anything to do with two people entering one voting booth and then leaving with [ five votes ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=q5ol-vzv5re ) ? 
  you can say a lot about the american election but comparing it to that type of blatant fraud is nuts .
