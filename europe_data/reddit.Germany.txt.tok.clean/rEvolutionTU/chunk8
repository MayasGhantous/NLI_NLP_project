  who i can blame is my own government claiming they were prepared and the eu for not responding to the crisis . 
  the eu ** ca n't ** respond because we have countries blocking the response . 
  all we can do right now is have countries voluntarily help out in these situations which does n't * really * make things more balanced . 
  ________  i do n't see how frontex is going to solve this . 
  it does n't . 
  it however is the step in the correct direction . 
  currently the answer to refugees is e.g. 
  germany shouldering large amounts with poland e.g. 
  saying `` fuck that shit we do n't want any '' . 
  the answer to border control is e.g. 
  italy or greece shouldering massive amounts with e.g. 
  hungary saying `` fuck that shit we do n't want any '' . 
  ** but in the end every single refugee coming to germany is a polish problem and every single illegal border crossing to italy is a hungarian problem . 
  ** that 's what needs to sink in . 
  right now we have ( taking you as an example here ) an italian complaining about this :  people essentially drive their tiny boats to the middle of the sea and dare us to leave them to die and we 're stuck to ferry them to eu under the current law that should n't be ** your ** problem . 
  it should be my problem and i should be bitching in germany that our legislation is fucked . 
  people in poland should be bitching that this ca n't be a thing or if it is we need to find a way to make it work properly , effectively and within our basic rights and values . 
  if frontex agents from all across europe are helping out italy or greece they can hopefully report back to their governments that we need to change our laws and resources to cope with the situation . 
  i just see it as a small part of a large problem . 
  but as it stands we do n't even have a consensus on who should deal with what borders . 
  ______ and , to be frank , every consensus that does n't start with `` it 's our collective problem '' is outright unsustainable bullshit . 
  that 's not how a union with inwards open borders works . 
  it ca n't work . 
  our civil unions are * really * close to marriages since a decade at this point and the vast majority of the population supports `` real '' gay marriage but yeah , still a valid point . 
  what mindsets would you say are where germans could learn from you ? 
  which positions shifted to what in the netherlands over the last 30 years from your perspective ? 
  that 's nice of course but it does n't help if italy , greece or any other country has issues they need help with . 
  an eu wide border agency can shift focus quicker , more flexible and cheaper than any other solution . 
  it 's completely irrelevant if hungary ( or any other country ) can control their individual borders well for the overall topic of immigration/refugees , the weakest link in the chain is what matters . 
  we can * probably * all agree that non-eu citizens moving around within the eu is much less of an issue if we control them properly at eu borders . 
  [ h\u00d6cke h\u00d6cke h\u00d6cke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pve2dq7ao2k&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=274 ), 
  what annoys me with e.g. 
  hungary having such a strong rhetoric with regards to refugees is that to my knowledge they and poland were the ones who objected giving [ frontex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex ) more resources/powers because they were afraid of losing sovereignty . 
  you ca n't both blame the eu that it has weak shitty borders ** and ** block efforts to make european borders stronger . 
  to me the refugee crisis should have been the last bit any country needs to be convinced that we need eu borders that can actually do their job properly . 
  every place where non-eu citizens enter the eu is a concern of the entire union . 
  _________ ... also he referred to soros in his speech . 
  it 's obviously just for fun but it still hurts seeing how he handles the katana like an axe with massive force . 
  oh , thanks . 
  so that 's why we have n't seen any kind of changes in the last decade ? 
  i must have completely misunderstood how politics works in my country , thanks for educating me !, 
  oh god . 
  the italians ca n't know about this . 
  if they realize it would be `` even canada has a larger gdp than russia '' instead of `` even italy has a larger gdp than russia '' you 're getting recommended into the eu pretty much instantly . 
  welp , i 'm bad . 
  thanks !, 
  if we take the federal budget from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_government_budgets_by_country#list ) and compare it with the military budget ( 39400m ) it makes up 2.32 % . 
  if we take the us from the same source ( x1 .45 aka 5798550m due to the note on top ) and their military budget ( 596000m ) we 're at 10.2 % of the total budget . 
  now we 're at a factor of 4.4 difference while difference in % gdp was at a factor of 2.75 ... mhmmmm ... that 's still a pretty large error , not sure if that 's due to the numbers being too rough or if i 'm still missing something . 
  man , it always gets me how emma watson looks like a happy corgi in that picture . 
  that 's ** the ** strength of merkel as a politician however and part of why i personally am pretty happy with her overall . 
  there wo n't be any rash or hasty words from that direction , it 's more like do some math , make some calls and then present a direction that does n't sound too bad - ideally even framed as pro-american . 
  `` i met the guy , it 's bad , oh god please help . '', 
  in 1913 39 % of the population was jewish , in 2000 it was 0.3 % ( e : in thessaloniki ) . 
  [ [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_greece#world_war_ii.2c_resistance_and_the_holocaust ) ]  in march 2015 , a survey about the greeks ' perceptions of the holocaust was published . 
  its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum . 
  giorgos antoniou , a historian at the international hellenic university , commented to the article and said that `` the holocaust is not really treated as an issue of national concern '' . 
  [ ... ]  the adl ( anti-defamation league ) published on 2015 the `` adl global 100 '' , a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world . 
  according to its findings , 69 % of the adult population in greece harbor antisemitic attitudes . 
  furthermore , the research found out that 38 % of the population agree with the statement `` jews are responsible for most of the world 's wars '' , and 85 % think that `` jews have too much power in the business world '' . 
  well , [ fuck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism_in_greece#current_situation ) . 
  the info on wiki is bad enough already , but maybe we can get some better input from greeks here . 
  tagging on here because maybe someone who can answer my ( related ) [ question ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u86q2/defense_secretary_mattis_issues_new_ultimatum_to/ddt7k5u/ ) has a better chance of seeing it . 
  in a nutshell there 's a massive , massive discrepancy between % / gdp and % / total budget funds that i do n't understand at all that at least to me makes what / u/jtalin is getting at much more valid to ask . 
   also , you have to consider that the being not-sovereign , the being-oppressed narrative is strong in hungarian identity . 
  `` we were occupied by the ottomans , then by the habsburgs , then by the nazis , then by the soviet union '' , `` and now it 's the eu who meddles with our affairs '' -- brexit-like sentiment . 
  oddly enough that reminds me a bit of what poles told me about their views . 
  when some people hear shit like `` european x '' they seem to hear `` ussr x '' and instantly panic . 
  i can * somewhat * understand it , but still ... 
   that geographic position is central to our national myth , our idea of ourselves . 
  from shakespeare , to napoleon to the spanish armada , this idea is fundamental to understanding brits . 
  fog in the channel - continent cut off !, 
  that was well written , can easily sell that !, 
   i do n't think the idea of staying in or leaving the eu are extremist views , so this is a debate we should not fear having . 
  not the * idea * but the * execution * of the campaign . 
  pretty much reminded me of [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dd5avxlcc ) sneaky fellow who claims his company was one of the driving forces behind brexit . 
  but yeah , you 're right maybe it was just the right `` roughness '' required for that kind of topic . 
  anyway , thanks for the chat . 
  you also did n't offer any concrete solutions . 
  you ca n't just say `` i want to be rid of them all '' without addressing the issues i outlined about that very perspective . 
  one of my favorite german documents ( in english ) might shed some light on it : [ german press codex ] ( https://www.presserat.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads_dateien/pressekodex13english_web.pdf ) . 
  it 's basically a common codex the german press agreed upon in the 1970s to set a common standard and ensure the public can trust the press and can issue complaints if set rules are broken . 
   * these professional ethics give everyone the right to complain about the press . 
  complaints are justified if professional ethics are infringed . 
  * even the worst of the worst outlets such as bild * usually * are mostly in line with it . 
  and even if the germn press council is pretty much a paper-tiger in practice ( this kind of public apology is the highest punishment ) it does seem to do its job most of the time . 
  [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutscher_presserat#/media/file:geruegte_medien.svg ) is a list of which outlets got the highest punishment ( the outlet being asked to publicly print a reprimand/apology ) how often since 1986 . 
  the red 109 is bild . 
  you do know that if there 's an example of a country that ** will ** tell everyone a certain person is a citizen it 's iran , right ? 
  =p that 's why german and british mps were initially affected by the travel ban , even people living here for 30 + years ca n't officially renounce iranian citizenship . 
  this irks me every time this is posted . 
  if you look at for example the [ pew survey ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/negative-views-of-minorities-refugees-common-in-eu/ ) ( note how that one also actually has proper details and infos ? ), 
  they cite it went from `` 29 % of german/french have an unvavorable opinion of islam in 2016 '' ( okay , that number makes sense ) to `` 61 % of french and 53 % of germans want a ** total ban on all migration from all muslim-majority countries ** '' in this study . 
  in other words not only do ** all ** french who have an unfavorable opinion of islam want a complete ban in this survey but also 50 % of french who did ** not ** say they see islam as unfavorable in the pew survey from mid-2016 now want a complete ban for example . 
  _______ i 'm not even saying `` this survey is all wrong !!, 
  ! 11 '' , but it * is * rather odd compared to others and we do n't have the socio-demographic differences split up on a per country basis or any more info at all . 
  all we get on methodology is this :  the chatham house europe programme , with kantar public , surveyed nationally representative samples of the population aged 18 or over in austria , belgium , france , germany , greece , hungary , italy , poland , spain and the uk . 
  ** fieldwork was carried out online using quota sampling ** ( age , gender and region ) between 12 december 2016 and 11 january 2017 . 
  the total number of respondents was 10,195 ( c. 1,000 per country ) . 
  while we 're at this topic , here 's something odd i found out when i last looked into this , maybe someone here can explain this to me .
