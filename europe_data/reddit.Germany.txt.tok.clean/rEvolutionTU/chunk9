  let 's start with some data points . 
  everything below is talking about military expenses . 
  ___________ the us spends 3.3 % of their gdp , germany 1.2 % and russia 5.4 % . 
  [ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures\\#list ) ] when we look at federal households the us spends [ 16 % ] ( http://www.cbpp.org/most-of-budget-goes-toward-defense-social-security-and-major-health-programs-0 ) and germany spends [ 11.24 % ] ( https://www.bundeshaushalt-info.de/#/2017/soll/ausgaben/einzelplan.html ) of their total household . 
  i have a hard time finding this number for russia , i only distinctly remember this figure to be around 20 % . 
  small bonus info , this figure for germany used to be at 24.6 % in 1960 and 15.1 % in 1990 [ [ 2 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/verteidigungsetat\\#kalter_krieg ) ] . 
  ___________ now i 'm sure someone already noticed where i 'm going with this : the us spends 2.75 times ( 3.3 / 1.2 ) as much as germany in terms of % / gdp . 
  but the us also spends 1.42 times ( 16/11 .24 ) as much as % / total household . 
  to hit the same % / gdp as the us germany would have to increase its current % / household spending by a factor of 2.75 which means germany would have to use ** 31 % of its total household for military expenses ** . 
  ___________ what am i missing ? 
  is one of my sources bad ? 
  is this similar for other eu countries ? 
  * something * has to be wrong with the above . 
   apparently sweden and finland is now a part of eastern europe . 
  according to the good ol' [ caspian report ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbrklnh8wla ) which is usually reasonable with its sources norway has issues with russia because of the [ svalbard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svalbard ) islands where russia seems to be settling workers so there 's a +1 . 
  also , as a german , i 'm under no illusion that if poland is threatened , germany is threatened . 
  if history is anything to go by this continent rises and falls together . 
  that wo n't change even if some want to rather bury their heads in the sand and wall up their own country . 
  ________  russia will never change its violent ways , as history has shown it will always remain a menace to the peoples of eastern , northern and central europe . 
  i 'd go further than that . 
  the russia we know literally ca n't exist without being an authoritarian state . 
  russia unites [ 185 ethnic groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_russia ) and [ 35 official languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_russia ) alone . 
  combined with the vast distances the country relies on its massive intelligence apparatus and an authoritarian regime because otherwise it would just fall apart into smaller blocks and separatist movements . 
  combined with the geographical location of their heart ( moscow area ) , their military backup plans ( pulling back behind the ural ) and them being directly connected to the [ european plain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/european_plain.png ) the russia we know will also always feel threatened . 
  and yes , every single country on that plain or connected to it should also feel threatened by a strong , expansionist russia . 
  an actual european block is worse than nato from the russian perspective , that 's why their aim is to destabilize it . 
  / r/wholesomememes !, 
   but the fact that in the last 300 years we have not endured fascism or communism or civil war or invasion does make us very unusual from a european perspective . 
  i 'm not entirely sure here . 
  the unusual part to me is that when shit goes down on the continent you 're still involved and dragged in by definition , it 's just that you 're less dragged in than germany , france or any other of the major and minor players simply based on geography . 
  to me that is a massive part of what made the uk always a bit weird in the eu . 
  sure you 're part of the team ( and for example your interest in peace on the continent directly aligns with the eu ) but you 're also not part of the team in the sense that german or french geopolitical ideas and priorities will always be different from yours simply because of the whole island thing . 
  on the other hand we can also trace back a line to the uk and france when it comes to destabilizing the middle east or think of [ war crimes the uk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mau_mau_uprising#deaths ) committed not * that * long ago , so it is n't all sunshine and glory for centuries either . 
  overall though , yeah , the uk definitely had a brighter history than most of europe and the world . 
  it sometimes feels a bit like the uk still has n't found its ` proper ' place in the modern world . 
  you 're not * really * tight with the ideas of the eu , you 're not * really * the empire you used to be . 
  it 's all a bit weird overall . 
  ______  but i think in this kind of argument , you have to trust the public to use their judgment and sift the truth from fiction . 
  yeah , that 's where we fundamentally disagree i think . 
  i have trust in the public to use their judgement ** if ** things are framed somewhat neutrally . 
  but i 'm also absolutely convinced that extremists from any direction have a much easier time exploiting openings if laws and rules allow for them which is why public opinion needs to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  feelings and emotions dictate the will of the people overall , not facts and reality . 
  and when in doubt we all are prone to confirmation bias , especially when we 're not fully and properly educated on issues . 
  unrelated but still somewhat fitting : [ this small segment . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fack2knc08e&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=716 ) - also i need to spread that documentary because it 's overall rather well made . 
  ____  i am giving you loads of upvotes . 
  i know , same . 
   us news is enough to have me rocking back and forth in the corner weeping softly to myself . 
  do n't worry , we know that feeling , too . 
  the russian things ( e.g. 
  ukraine was/is under heavy attack by totally not russian separatists again since the inauguration ) are n't super obvious in our perspective either compared to trump . 
  here 's something imo well-curated to bring some sanity into that topic : https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com, 
  i originally got the concept from a book by alberto gandolfi which seems to only be available in german [ here ] ( https://www.amazon.de/menschen-ameisen-denken-komplexen-zusammenh%c3%a4ngen/dp/3280026695 ) that was recommended to me as an introduction to the topic of [ complex systems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_systems ) in general and ideas about * a * [ complex system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_system ) specifically . 
  where it gets fun ( and which is what i referred to above specifically ) are so called [ complex adaptive systems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_adaptive_system ) which refers to complex systems and their change over time with certain variables being adjusted . 
  obviously super simplified and among other characteristics the whole amount of agents/amount of connections between agents are some basic `` knobs '' you can play around with that push systems closer to linear or closer to chaotic states . 
  ________ think of two people having a discussion versus thousands of people having one . 
  the basic premise is that if it 's very few people we can predict the outcome based on what we know about the initial input . 
  if it 's just enough people our new system will adapt fluently and become extremely productive , much more so than any linear system ever can be . 
  if too many people contribute there will suddenly be anomalies that you could have never anticipated which spread through the entire system , it 's also possible that it 's completely impossible to exist and breaks down into smaller systems that interact with each other as a direct result . 
  ________ analogue a cas can be pushed towards a more chaotic state simply because it reached its current state based on different initial conditions that are now changing , weather patterns vs climate change are a great example there . 
  * belarus currently is holding massive military exercises , including pulling in reservists . 
  [ [ source ] ( http://belsat.eu/en/news/snap-drills-or-show-of-power-belarus-calling-out-reserve-forces-on-massive-scale/ ) ] * russia has established a `` full-fledged border-protection regime '' on its western border with belarus because of the `` threat '' from there due to their [ new visa policy ] ( http://belarusdigest.com/story/belarus-opens-government-announces-visa-free-entrance-27099 ) . 
  [ [ source ] ( http://www.rferl.org/a/russia-belarus-border-security-zone/28273799.html ) ] * russian news outlets are currently spreading false claims that poland is invading belarus and american officials are allegedly actively looking into these claims . 
  [ [ source ] ( http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/on-foreign-policy-team-trump-still-speaking-campaign-language ) ] * for march joint russian-belarus combined training exercises ( see first source ) are announced . 
  ________ what this actually * means * ( or whether it has any bigger implication at all ) i have no idea . 
  from lukashenko being kicked out in march with russian help , them officially growing tighter again , over a genuine belarussian-russian conflict all the way to `` poland is attacking belarus '' while `` neutral '' american observers end up confirming it everything is on the table to me . 
  _______ it * does * suggest to me there might be * something * brewing in that area . 
  if there 's one thing that 's clear from the recent pro-kremlin campaigns is that russia has a vested interest in destabilizing the eu and they are committing comparatively massive and specialized resources to do so :  targeting the russian speaking minority seems the most important tool in the baltic states , whereas in central europe it seems to be the use of dozens of `` alternative `` websites , while trolling seems most prevalent in scandinavia . 
  [ [ source . 
  ] ( https://euvsdisinfo.eu/intimidation-as-a-propaganda-tool-in-the-nordic-countries/ ) ], 
   but i do think we have very different ideas about how we want our democracies to function . 
  what are you think of when you mention this specifically ? 
  what to you is `` typical uk '' about your democracy among the western world ? 
  _____  the people responsible for governing the country and the people who were elected to govern the country !, 
  what nigel does now is his own business , but i am glad he is not involved in brexit . 
  i have a genuinely hard time comprehending that thought process . 
  here 's an example of a person who lead the brexit movement , was not exactly famous for his honesty in convincing people it 's a good idea . 
  now he achieved the goal and other people need to figure out how to actually get it done and how to explain some of the stories that were n't particularly true to the public that was convinced by them . 
  if we just narrow it down to for example the nhs bus and those # 350m - the people responsible for that kind of story are gone , the public who used it as an example to cast a specific vote were lied to . 
  are n't examples like this good reasons to doubt whether the referendum was done `` properly '' ? 
  whether the ` will of the people ' that spoke was * really * the will of the people ? 
  ____  and this , in my mind , is the rational way to think about brexit . 
  what bad thing has it actually caused ? 
  ( lots of downvotes for me i guess ...  ) voting patterns in only this current chain are funny already - i think i got the `` better '' one-liners initially but since then you 're just presenting the better arguments while i 'm learning some things i did n't it know about so i 'm getting the downvote hammer . 
   it is an alternative fact because it implies they will stop receiving monetary assistance once germany leaves the eu . 
  this is a false equivalence . 
  i never said that . 
  i said that out of all the money that germany gets back from the eu they 're the main benefactor . 
  the eu , by definition , is better for them than for any other german area with regards to funding . 
  the implication was in your head , not in what i said . 
   wait , what ? 
  why is that ? 
  once germany leaves the eu they will be free to redistribute the money they 've saved in whatever way they please . 
  assuming afd is in power when they leave the union , they could pass on savings to their main voters who live in underdeveloped regions . 
  and if bavaria leaves the german union they 'd be better off as well . 
  i 'll break it down from another angle . 
  group a and group b both pay taxes . 
  group a gets road built from these taxes . 
  group b does n't . 
  it 's somewhat rational that group b says `` i want some of that too , this taxing is bad for me '' - but in this case group a is saying `` fuck these taxes , they 're terrible for me . '',
