their careers are restricted and their influence . 
  not much better , really . 
  not really . 
  it 's still a pretty shitty thing to do . 
  those are elected officials who people voted for in order to represent their opinion ( well , at least some of them are ) . 
  to silence their voices because they voted differently due to their conscience reeks of contempt for democracy . 
  and thank you for your reply . 
  i was n't aware that this definition of the west was n't as pervasive as i thought it was . 
  i assumed it 's used that way in most if not all of the world . 
  i see , thanks !, 
  i ca n't find the link in this thread anymore but i seem to remember that it was a pew one with a relatively representative sample ( i.e. 
  asking people from all over the country with the only criterion being that they were born in a specific time period ) . 
  do you think their friends are different in that regard ? 
  i 'd assume that they share these retarded viewpoints and as such would cringe about themselves , too , if they ever brought up this video . 
  now deleted comment by u/throwawayooo9  yes it is . 
  libel laws are different and the bar there is really high , while in europe people `` balance '' things so politicians can intimidate people they do n't like for things said that would never fly in us . 
  got an example ? 
  i have no idea what you are talking about . 
  did n't i mention that already ? 
  but fine , here we go : \u2022 ** societal values : ** individual freedom , egalitarianism , rule of law \u2022 ** economy : ** social market economy \u2022 ** government : ** parliamentary democracy & nbsp ; as you can see there are a lot of similarities . 
  compare these characteristics to , for instance , the middle east , africa or certain parts of asia and it should be obvious that poland has far more in common with other such `` western '' nations than the rest . 
  again , since you seem to fail to understand this , i am ** not ** saying that there are no differences between western nations that share these things . 
  you can have subsets like `` eastern western nations '' if you want but that does not change that the still belong to the larger set of `` western nations '' . 
  ah , okay , thanks . 
  exactly . 
  great , another person who does n't get the definition of `` western '' . 
  do n't you realize that this term concerns certain shared characteristics which poland de facto does have as well ? 
  that there are still differences between western countries besides those shared characteristics does n't invalidate the fact that poland still fits the definition of a `` western '' nation . 
  again , how is that relevant ? 
  free speech refers to laws that prevent the government for prohibiting certain kinds of speech . 
  adawidowicz claimed that outside of poland you get `` bashed around '' for making certain jokes . 
  i pointed out that how ** society ** reacts to certain statements is irrelevant to the question of whether or not ** the government ** guarantees free speech . 
  your rant has nothing to do with that question . 
  do you not see that ? 
  again , i think you do n't get that `` western '' does not mean anything geographical in this context . 
  it refers to similarities with european countries ( hence why israel is considered western even though it 's obviously not located in the geographical west ) . 
  what i mean by poland having a western economy and government is that poland is a parliamentary democracy with a free market economy ( as opposed to , for example , being an authoritarian regime with a state-run planned economy ) . 
  well , the united kingdom is a special case , i think , given that it 's anglophone and usually further ahead in terms of catching up to 'm urrican trends when compared to the rest of europe . 
  but even so , would you say that it 's already as bad in the uk as it is in the us ? 
  that they are a small minority is belied by polls who show approval rates of 40 % for their corrosive mindset among millennials . 
  this is n't the negligible problem that you think it is . 
  as for the changes being superficial , what exactly do you mean by that ? 
  something like the banning of gendered pronouns does n't sound superficial to me . 
  and in any case , the real threat here is having those twats in positions of power after they graduate which is where they 'll wield actual political power at the latest and could enforce their shitty views for real . 
  not taken seriously ? 
  given how many universities caved in when they found themselves in similar circumstances i think that 's pretty obviously not true . 
  besides , even if it were restricted to influencing the student governments ( which it is n't ) then that would still mean quite a lot of influence on the universities by proxy . 
  yet what is most worrying about this is not what happens in college but what happens afterwards when those imbeciles graduate and assume influential positions in society . 
  i think you are seriously underestimating how widespread that corrosive mindset is . 
  did n't one of the users in this thread mention a poll involving millennials that had 40 % agreeing that speech offensive to minorities should be prohibited ? 
  yeah , do n't a lot of them start college when they 're 18 or younger ? 
  only if they are identifiable in that video which i 'm not sure they are . 
  they certainly did n't mention their names anywhere . 
  i answered this a bit further down in this thread but i 'm gon na quote u/espumma who , errr , phrased it a little better than i did :  from what i understand , some guy from the cultural department sent an email to everybody saying that you should think about your halloween costume and what it might implicate . 
  then a woman ( the wife of the white guy in the video ) responded that it is a manner of free speech . 
  and then people started to whine that she should be removed from her position because she was not supporting a safe space on campus . 
  the guy here is defending his wife in some way . 
  ultimately , the yale administration supported her as well and she is not going away . 
  well , no , i would n't say that . 
  in fact i think there are definitely issues with its limitations on free speech going too far ( for instance , why the fuck ca n't swastikas be shown in wwii video games ? ), 
  but on the whole it 's a fairly acceptable mix . 
  uh , yeah , that 's a geographical term , you genius , not one about its culture or society . 
  you realize that western in this context does n't just mean `` located in the cardinal direction west '' , right ? 
  oh if only that were it . 
  alas , polls show that this kind of mindset is rather prevalent . 
  did n't someone on this page cite one that asked millennials if people should be prohibited from saying things that are offensive to minorities ... to which 40 % said yes ? 
  your point being ... ? 
  says who ? 
  your values , your society , your government , your economy ... all western . 
  your language , too , if we define western to mean `` derived from europe '' ( as is commonly done ) . 
  how is poland not western in that sense ? 
  some sjw twats told people to not dress up in `` culturally inappropriate ways '' for halloween , someone employed by the university called them out on their bullshit and they then threw a hissy fit in response , claiming that said employee * denigrated their legitimate feelings * or some such nonsense . 
  obviously they could n't voice their opinion in a sane , civilized manner and so when said employee and others decided to meet with them and listen to their complaints ... well , they lost their shit and devolved the discussion into shouting mobs . 
  i think you misunderstand what i am talking about in that previous comment . 
  i 'm referring to `` real '' , tangible effects of said sjw shenanigans . 
  i am currently studying at a university so i know first-hand that such twats exist on german campuses , too . 
  however , from what i can tell they have not managed to infiltrate and influence the universities ' structures anywhere near to the extent that they have overseas . 
  meaning : while you have idiots in germany , too , who try to pull this shit they are mostly not , unlike in the u.s. , able to force their shitty ideologies on others through the administrative process . 
  they are still powerless crybabies here for the most part whereas in the usa they can actually wield some influence . 
  only in theory . 
  look at any government ever and it should become obvious that much of what governments do does not have the approval ( be it implicit or explicit ) of their people . 
  in addition , we are talking about a constitutional right here and those are not easily changed , no matter the public opinion . 
  what ? 
  hahaha , what ? 
  well , to each their own , i suppose ... 
  being bashed around ? 
  by whom ? 
  you mean society ? 
  that is not what free speech is about . 
  free speech is about governmental control of speech ( i.e. 
  about the legal framework ) , not how tolerant of controversial speech the population is . 
  `` the wrong political statement '' , huh ? 
  what is that code for ? 
  holocaust denial ? 
  inciting violence against minorities ? 
  or what ** actual ** political statement can get you into legal trouble * in the west * ( which , correct me if i 'm wrong , poland is a part of ) ? 
  he 's not even right . 
  the u.s. popularized and exported that whole sjw garbage to the rest of the world . 
  i ca n't speak for the rest of europe but germany has yet to reach the what-the-fuck heights of these trends that they reached in the u.s. 
  no , it 's not .
