uhh , it \u00b4 s like in the former drr ( east germany ), 
  behold the eu plug with grounding , available in every eu country except the uk [ picture here ] ( http://www.advin.com/plug-fe-w512.jpg ), 
  a disastrous trip doesn \u00b4 t sound fun , i guess you should give it a try again  haha yeah with salami you can \u00b4 t do anything wrong :d, 
  really ? 
  that \u00b4 s interesting . 
  in german as example you would order one loaf of bread ( ein laib brot ) . 
  laib origins out of the germanic word * hleip * what ment originally unleavened bread . 
  at first it would be a start switching the water filtration in whole europe to [ reverse osmosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reverse_osmosis ) in order to filter organic micropollutants . 
  estrogens from the pill in groundwater ( or hormone similar substances from plastic bottles ) are linked to low fertility rates in developed countrys . 
  besides this is the only way to filtrate organic micropollutants like pharmaceuticals , plastic nanoparticles ( which are even found in milk ) and pesticides from our drinking water and food chain . 
  because it \u00b4 s quite cost intensive it \u00b4 s not very common . 
  this would benefit all of us . 
  a family friendly politic like paid leave time for mothers and fathers with a guarantee to return in the position of work where you left , europe wide child benefit , low cost high quality childcare and a free high quality education would do the rest . 
  of course it costs , but what doesn \u00b4 t. 
  that would be money well spend . 
  edit : spelling, 
  just about 1,25 % of the population ... could really be better . 
  but better then nothing . 
  i guess some people will ask like how i got to this 1,25 % ... its calculated with 80 million citizen . 
  yeah yeah i know germany has 81,4 million citizens ( 2014 ) . 
  it \u00b4 s like asking : hey i \u00b4 m in the american continent for the month what should i visit ? 
  whole europe is rich in unique important places . 
  i live here and i still didn \u00b4 t manage to visit everything and i travel a lot . 
  if i win the lottery and quit my work i perhaps manage to visit everything in my lifetime . 
  you should now have an idea on how much lovely places there are in this continent . 
  here \u00b4 s a tip : go to a libary , fetch some travel books about your most favorite countrys and make a list . 
  traveling by train gives you a nice view while traveling . 
  there is one ticket for the whole eu but just for eu citizens and from albania , andorra , belarus , bosnia-herzegovina , fyr macedonia , gibraltar , iceland , kosovo , liechtenstein , moldova , monaco , montenegro , norway , russian federation , san marino , serbia , switzerland , turkey , ukraine and vatican city http://www.interrail.eu/interrail-passes all other : http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes the right subreddits : / r/interrail / r/askeurope, 
  in some german citys and reagions you need a hundef\u00fchrerschein ( dog leading license ) if you want to walk your dog without a leash . 
  or if you have a `` dangerous '' breed you need one . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hundef%c3%bchrerschein there is no general required obedience training needed in germany . 
  but we have a lot dog schools and voluntary association where you can train/let train your dog . 
  the german commenter was a fucking ashole !, 
  i watched it with friends , man !, 
  this guy made fun and rude comments about every one . 
  even with the singer in the wheelchere he said something about songs heal and tracks ... wtf !, 
  this guy belongs punched in the face for his fucking comments . 
  btw he looked like a alkoholic what would explain it ... 
  it wasn \u00b4 t actuall aimed at ireland , sorry that i was a little bit misleading . 
  so you suggesting a marshal plan for greece ? 
  i think that would mean a total cut in debts and a lot of money from the eu . 
  at least they managed to build one ... . . * cough * ... berlin ... * cough * . . 
  good example venezuela and argentina / s, 
  now it \u00b4 s the right time to blame the eu for that . 
  lol 318,000, 
  that \u00b4 s mean / s. 
  taking the chance for everybody to be able to read kant , g\u00f6the , hesse , fontane and schiller in german would be a pitty . 
  the one in germany and the whole european one . 
  it can \u00b4 t be that our secret service spies on our own companys for the us , that \u00b4 s treason . 
  and who ever allowed them that , commits treason too . 
  and for europe , we have to stick together . 
  it can \u00b4 t be that selectors are pointed at eu institutions and politicans . 
  and for me , that should apply for every eu country . 
  we shouldn \u00b4 t spy on each other but rather work together . 
  europe is for me my community of ( shared ) values . 
  and this values are based in mutual trust and frienship . 
   martha r. simms is the director of operations at the john hay initiative in washington , d.c. 
  the john hay initiative is mitt romney 's foreign policy team . . short answer to the headline : no we won \u00b4 t calm down !, 
  i don \u00b4 t want this to happen in my country . 
  it destroys our democracy from within . 
  thx for trying to convince me / s . 
  or german ... muhahahaa ... xd, 
  grimbergen is a realy nice beer . 
  i actually like all sorts of them . 
  kru\u0161ovice dark - cz budweiser - cz grimbergen ( all sorts ) - be guinness - ir, 
  and that in the middle of europe . . 
  agree , thats fucking enoying, 
   if you wan \u00b4 t peace you should prepare for war aha ... 
  super . . for one moment i was thinking i was in / r/europe, 
  could be germany too , we are famous for our `` schilderwald '', 
  that would be quite nice , i hope i will see that in 20 years . 
  so i shoulnd ` t take a hemp bag to poland ? 
  ... lol, 
   interestingly , the germans are the worst , which of course confirms the role the media play in this - my favourite was my numskull colleague who ... please don \u00b4 t make generalizations because you have a stupid colleague , that \u00b4 s quite unfair to the 86 million other germans . 
  but seriously , we seem to be all not so good in following the eu rules on how it looks like . 
  uk 18 de 11 so i \u00b4 m right  the `` infringement cases '' are the blue bars . 
  the red ones are `` late or incorrect transpositions '', 
  thatcher argument 1984 also was the low level of prosperity of the united kingdom . 
  2001 the rabate was 7.1 billion euro , 2005 about 5.1 billion euro . 
  it should have been canceled a long time ago , 1984 is already far away and things have changed a lot . 
  im for sure not a fan of the highway toll , but at least you don \u00b4 t loose your car here for a little speeding like in other countrys ^ ^ if we are talking about breaking any rules or some unfair treatment we should talk about the the uk rabate what is 66 % of what the uk pays into the eu . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_rebate or in gerneral the euro convergence criteria . 
  lol, 
  news from november 2014 ? 
  snus ... anybody else thinking about futurama right now ? 
  first time i heard about that . 
  and i can \u00b4 t find this news in german , so even no swiss or austrian news about it . 
  but i found out that putin said that on the 5 . november 2014 at a meeting with young academics and history teachers . 
  german article and official russian transcript ( english ) : http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/das-geschichtsbild-des-kreml-putin-verteidigt-hitler-stalin.1818.de.html?dram%3aarticle_id=302596 http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/46951 i can \u00b4 t find any news relating to this for this date and even a google search revelead nothing , the euobserver reported this news 3 days ago ( google says this link is 3 days old ) , on friday and was the only one . 
  merkel was not in russia on friday but on saturday . i think it \u00b4 s some sort of hoax/propaganda news . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i see , yes that of course makes it easier for you  , have you got some examples ? 
  i just have some leanwords in my mind that are french or latin . 
  why that ? 
  because of the latin or of the french loanwords we have ? 
  of course german , duh . 
  `` live streaming is due right problems in germany not possible '' wtf : / edit : this one works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyrufajmgzo, 
  thats a typical us fear article from the nationalinterest.org . 
  they have so nice articles like : * asia 's next worry : an ` assertive ' japan ? 
  * the 5 greatest superpowers of all time * watch out , china : japan and australia are getting closer * nato beware : turkey may buy russia 's s-300 air defense system best is there cover from there new issue : countdown to war : the coming u.s - russia conflict i hope we can ban this propaganda shit here in europe .
