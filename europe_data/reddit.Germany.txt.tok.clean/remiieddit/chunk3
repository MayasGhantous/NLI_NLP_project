  perhaps someone is able to make a transkript in english ? 
  i dont \u00b4 know it :( ... now i want one . 
  what \u00b4 s the taste ? 
  haha if you see a asian on the weekend evening with a total red face you know he is drunk xd happens to a friend of mine :d, 
   for once it 's the germans who have mastered the art of satire and the brits not getting it ... but in there defence , not only the brits didn \u00b4 t get it . 
  * it \u00b4 s like german , very harsh . . yeah , german is so harsh ... did you see the hitler speach ... so agressiv * ... . 
  is there a other source for the video ? 
  what idiot made the order in the video reading the names from down to up ... thats sooooo frustrating, 
  so at first i think i have to explain jan b\u00f6hmermann and his show . 
  it is a satirical show and his last video was a really fine mediasatiric . 
  the claim of responsibility via video is of course satiric and a really good made fake in its selfe . 
  the video with the middlefinger is real . 
  coming to your question , i think the main point what is important , is not that he showed the middlefinger but that he then denied it when he was asked about it . 
  it \u00b4 s about integrity . 
  if he said `` yes i did it and at this time it was the right thing to do '' or something simmilar there wouldn \u00b4 t be a discussion left . 
  but every one saw the video as he was denying it . 
  people will think twice if they can trust him with other issues or not . 
  that is how they transport this message . 
  i think that it is totally stupid to discuss about a over 2 year old video . 
  that doesn \u00b4 t help at all . 
  jan b\u00f6hmermann made this also clear with his video . 
  you still know that this is satiric right ? 
  it is a fake story , i find it funny that so many people think that this is real . 
  it is one of the best mediasatiric parts of his show since a long time . 
  it is allready in spiegel online , we will have to wait untill later in the day . 
  the video was pre-released to the show what will air today in the evening . 
  romanian dna is really working great these days , keept it up , 
  fucked up , riot tourism seems to be a thing now ... 
  apparently there are also a lot of italian activists who stir things up . 
  of course we didn \u00b4 t hear about that , because he tells bullshit . 
  in response to the ukraine crisis , nato leaders decided at the wales summit in september 2014 to implement perhaps the biggest military adaptation of the alliance since the end of the cold war . 
  the main objective is a large scale strengthening and strategic adaptation of the collective defence capacities and thus a return to power of collective defence as the primus inter pares among the three core tasks agreed by the alliance in the 2010 strategic concept ( the two others being cooperative security and crisis management ) . 
  while this adaptation requires considerable political , financial and military commitments from all of the allies , germany is at the centre of these efforts and is under pressure to deliver for four reasons . 
  first , because germany considerably shaped the wales summit decision to focus on readiness and responsiveness instead of a large scale permanent build-up of forces in eastern europe . 
  second , because the allies expect germany , as an economically powerful member and the alliance 's biggest european financial contributor , to carry more of the burden . 
  third , germany put itself under pressure to deliver when it submitted in 2013 the framework nation concept to improve multinational defence cooperation . 
  and forth , because other nations in the alliance appear to be reluctant to take the lead on this adaptation either because they are preoccupied by other issues , like france in africa ; are generally less willing to take the lead on this effort , like the us ; or are inhibited by budget constraints , like the uk . 
  poland advocated for a permanent stationing of combat troops in the east and abrogating the nato-russia founding act . 
  neither of these were agreed at the wales summit as they would have not left space a for dialogue with russia . 
  what do you actually want from us ? 
  german military covering your border to ukraine with leopard 2 tanks and so on ? 
  that germany sends weapons in to ukraine ? 
  do you really think that sending weapons will help ?!, 
  it will prolong this conflict and will just cause more casualties among civilians . 
  you seem to have no idea what merkel and the german goverment is trying the whole time , or do you wish for a war in complete europe . 
  diplomacy is the only alternative what we have to solve this crysis without more bloodshed . 
  wow , that video has a overly dramatic tone . 
  over 6 hour old comments and 17 retweets ... it must be real / s i think he is just in vacation and because he is putin he doesn \u00b4 t give a shit about saying it . 
  hahaha i think that is more a joke then serious ment . 
  but if you want to know , the prices in berlin for a m2 starts at about 4,50 $ . 
   @dobrymalo : because introducing group responsibility is well known to solve problems efficiently ...  @donvito : it 's a german thing . 
  you would n't understand . 
  your post before was just a backwards aligned and racist comment and tells a lot about you . 
   individualists are a minority in germany . 
  the society as a whole is rather collectivist and most germans strive to adapt and not to attract any attention from neighbors , the society , etc. 
  and that is blatant bullshit . 
  please just shut up . 
  and if you are german i will take `` racist '' away and feel sorry for you that you are a total idiot . 
  i don \u00b4 t know from where they got there numbers . 
  germany had 2013 a renewable energy production of 23,4 % , and the 2020 target is not 18 % but instead 35 % . 
  source : http://www.bundesregierung.de/content/de/artikel/2014/01/2014-01-13-bdew-energiebilanz-2013.html i think everybody should check there numbers from official sources . 
  edit : now it makes sense the numbers in the article are from : [ `` share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/4/48/overall_share_of_energy_from_renewable_sources_-_2013.png/700px-overall_share_of_energy_from_renewable_sources_-_2013.png ) , the numbers i had are from : [ `` share of electricity from renewable sources in gross electricity consumption '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/5/54/share_of_energy_from_renewable_sources_for_electricity_-_2013.png/700px-share_of_energy_from_renewable_sources_for_electricity_-_2013.png ) [ source ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/energy_from_renewable_sources ), 
  haha that \u00b4 s a good one :d thx, 
  you are trying to paint a wrong picture here . 
  comments on every news sections around the globe are like your exaggerationed examples . 
  do you really think this comment sections represents the voice of the german people ? 
  read the comment section of the guaradian , the sun or what ever other newspaper . 
  or do you litterly take all comments on reddit seriously from user `` x '' out of country `` y '' and project it on his whole county ? 
  what you of course don \u00b4 t write is that there are a lot of comments that find this idea great and support it . 
  so please stop try to prove your point with exaggerations and misinformation . 
  edit : spelling, 
  it was a command vehicle supposed to have no guns attached . 
  the soldiers still felt imbarressed of having no gun on there armoured vehicle at the exercise so they used the black-painted broomsticks instead . 
  but german military is still a mess . 
  yeah really ?!, 
  since when is a nato or a european * unions * country in war with russia . 
  did you actually read what i was answering to or noticed that he changed it ???!, 
  the level of stupidity is so high here at the moment ... arggggh edited for people who cant think for them selves and just have to say something to say something ... your welcome . . 
  in what world do you live ?!, 
  perhaps you should learn some basic facts about history bevor you open your mouth . 
  the slow deteration of the eastern block and the regime change in the kreml 1985 opened the chance for a military disarmament and a political approach . 
  michail gorbatschows abandonment of the brezhnev doctrine 1989 ( the fall af the berlin wall ) enabled the self-determination of central and eastern europe . 
  this brought the decay of the eastern block and the dissolution of the soviet union . 
  the cold war was over . 
  the us is not just currently doing everything to weaken the eu . 
  one big influential thinktank pointed that out  4 . 
  weaken the european project and strengthen the transatlantic alliance http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/01/top-5-foreign-policy-priorities-for-2014  the us has yet to produce a single us intelligence satellite picture of any russian equipment or troops in ukraine . 
  the us is supplying their cia satellite pictures to ukraine as part of the ongoing intelligence sharing exercise . 
  the us is degrading the quality of the satellite pictures before they share them with ukraine . 
  of course they are , every country does that . 
  you don \u00b4 t wan \u00b4 t to share how good or bad your satelite images are . 
  that russia supports the seperatists with weapons and manpower is clear . 
  if you remember at the beginning the seperatists where allmost defeted and got there tanks from an ww2 museum and now they are driving in new tanks ... 
  nobody won the cold war . 
  in the end , germany and russia ended it with the fall of the east-german wall . 
  is there much benefit keeping nato with the us nowadays ?
