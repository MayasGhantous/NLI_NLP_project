  i depends on what you consider as fair . 
  should countries with more tax revenue and more population take care of more asylum seekers than countries with less revenue and less population ? 
  is that fair ? 
  or is it fair that those countries , where asylum seekers land first , should take care of those , regardless of their economical situation ? 
  every country will have it 's own position on that matter . 
  and since those numbers are normalized , it means if population and/or tax revenue of one country/state drops , the ` load ' will be shared by others . 
  it is n't meant as a system to create equal economical balance within each state , but to share the burden in a manner that can be considered as ` fair ' . 
  as i said , it was n't designed with asylum seeker distribution in mind , but to fund large country run research project and was adopted to other projects and distributions later , because it seems to work well enough . 
  it was just considered as being ` fair ' , or at least to be working well enough with the distribution of asylum seekers as well . 
  but german states are also in a financial transfer union , which means weaker economies are supported by stronger ones to prevent the working force from leaving those states and bleeding them entirely dry ( it was necessary after the reunion since the economical situation of east german states was far behind the situation of west german states ; nowadays not only east german states benefit from it but also other states ) . 
  so if the economy of one state would start to break under the ` load ' of the asylum seekers , the transfer union would jump in and support the economy . 
  i would say so . 
  at least that is the reason why it was applied for this case in germany . 
  i do n't know if it would work on a eu-wide scale ( economically maybe , but politically/socially ? 
  i do n't think so ) . 
  also , since the info graphic wrongly says it is based on the gdp instead of the tax revenue , the actual distribution based on tax revenue of each country could be different . 
  i guess not by much . 
  i made an edit because the info graphic made a ~ ~ mistake ~ ~ change , it is * originally * calculated from the population and the tax revenue , not the gdp , which is a difference . 
  since asylum seekers are n't allowed to work , the actual unemployment rate does n't matter/get influenced by asylum seekers . 
  only if they get the status of a refugee ( asylum granted , now they are allowed to stay in germany and get a job ) they would influence it , but now they are also free to move within germany and chose where to live and work ( asylum seekers are n't allowed to freely chose where to live and have to stay near the place they are send to ; so they are n't even allowed to travel to other places or visit people they know ) . 
  so it is meant to put the biggest ` burden ' to the states with the best financial situation and the lowest ` burden ' to the states with the worst financial situation . 
  just for everyone to understand , this quota system does n't regulate how asylum seekers should be distributed within the eu , this system regulates how asylum seekers * in germany * should be/are distributed within * german states * ( bundesl\u00e4nder ) . 
  it is calculated based on the population of the state ( 1/3 ) and the ~ ~ gdp ~ ~ tax revenue of the state ( 2/3 ) . 
  this info graphic shows how it would like if we * would * use the same system for the eu , but it does n't really work together with the dublin regulation ( asylum seekers have to apply for asylum in the first country they arrive at ) . 
  edit : this quota system was n't created for asylum seekers distribution but how the funding of country wide research projects should be distributed . 
  it was later extended to other projects and the distribution of asylum seekers . 
  edit 2 : i do n't know why i capitalized the word ` state ' ... 
  :| ( this is a smile , obviously ), 
  thanks . 
  according to a quick google search those words were more distinct in the past but became synonyms more recently . 
  good to know . 
  and yeah , of course we also like babies . 
  i have to little nephews that i love . 
  but i still enjoy the freedom and spontaneity of not having children ... 
  i always thought jealousy is being afraid of losing something ( like your so ) while envy is wanting something that others have ( like more babies , but who would do that ? ) . 
  edit : at least those would be the direct translations into german ( jealousy = eifersucht , envy = neid ) and those are distinct in german, 
  by the way , should n't it be envious instead of jealous ? 
  edit : dogs , like german shepherds , on the other hand are perfectly fine . 
  they are easily trainable . 
  have you experienced babies ? 
  annoying little brats that ca n't follow orders and make everything chaotic and unplannable . 
  no wonder we germans ~ ~ do n't like ~ ~ avoid them ... 
  we like our humor ( chuckles ), 
  well , he did n't * write * winning ... 
  i think we both had two ` official ' world wars ... ^ you ^ do n't ^ have ^ to ^ be ^ sorry, 
  remember , life expectancy does n't only depend on health care and food . 
  it also depends on suicide rates , crime rates and safety . 
  [ this is a map of suicide rates ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/world-suicide-rate-map-2014-4?ir=t ) , and generally countries with higher suicide rates * will * have lower life expectancy . 
  both maps seem to correlate somewhat . 
  also a higher number of homicides and murders will lower life expectancy . 
  a higher number of fatal traffic accidents will lower life expectancy . 
  thank you , i really appreciate it !, 
  as a quick answer , conservatism in germany is usually seen as the tendencies to * conserve * traditional christian western and german values . 
  i think u.s. conservatism ( republicans ) and maybe even democrats are further to the right than german conservatives and those might even be considered center-left in the u.s. ** edit : ** i think conservatives are considered those who oppose changes , even though those changes could be beneficial for a society or economy . 
  it is mostly used for political parties like the cdu ( the party chancellor merkel belongs to ) and the fdp . 
  now i 'm getting more into detail , so long explanation ahead . 
  i do n't know where you 're from , but for example unlike the two-party system of the u.s. , germany has a multi-party system . 
  the strongest two are the cdu ( christian democratic union , center-right ( slightly right ) ) and the spd ( socialdemocratic party of germany , center-left ( a bit further to the left ) ) . 
  the conservative cdu honors traditional christian values , like the traditional family ( working father , stay at home mother ) , and therefore somewhat oppose gay rights and gay marriage . 
  they 're also known to oppose natural protection acts to help the german industry ( german car manufacturers as an example do n't like carbon dioxide and other emission limitations , but factories in general dislike those as well ) . 
  regarding education , they also favor mandatory religion classes over mandatory sex ed classes . 
  even though they are slightly right , they still are pro eu and pro euro , but for example oppose the idea of a transfer union ( where differences in economical strength are countered by regular financial transfers from more powerful to less powerful economies ; we have a transfer union in germany where stronger states support weaker states ) . 
  they are strongest in more religious states , like the south and the west , and rural areas . 
  the spd on the other hand is a typical european socialist party . 
  they favor more social programs , more market control , equal rights for everyone , a transfer union and so on . 
  so they do n't want to conserve , but some change , especially regarding culture and society . 
  the spd is strongest in former east german states and bigger cities . 
  left to the spd is ` die linke ' ( the left ) , a party that partially formed from the former east german socialist sed ( socialist unity party of germany , de facto the only party in the socialist east german system , you could only chose to elect or not elect them but not chose a different party , they usually ` got '  95 % of the votes ( with manipulation , of course ) ) . 
  they are similar to the spd but openly oppose capitalism and are sometimes considered being ` extremist ' or having ` antidemocratic tendencies ' . 
  the left is strongest in the former east german states , and in city states like berlin , hamburg and bremen . 
  a center party is the fdp ( free democratic party ) who are liberal . 
  their main target group are middle class and upper class citizen and companies . 
  they were traditionally the smaller coalition partner of the cdu but they crashed big time recently and did n't even made it into the parliament on the last election ( we have a 5 % threshold ) . 
  over the time they shifted somewhat to the center-right and towards conservatism as well . 
  further to the right is the new afd ( alternative for germany ) . 
  they are also considered conservative . 
  they openly oppose the eu and the euro and want germany to go back the the dm ( deutsche mark , currency before the euro ) . 
  they are considered being part of the recent right wing tendencies of the eu . 
  they attract some right wing voters but claim they are not anti-immigration and anti-tolerance . 
  they also think cdu shifted towards the left and is to * liberal * on gay rights . 
  it is a young party attracting people coming from many different parties and their tendencies are n't fully clear yet , they have internal struggles to find their stance . 
  they are strong with ` protest voters ' who think none of the traditional parties can represent them . 
  further to the right is the npd ( national party of germany ) . 
  they are openly called being a neonazi party . 
  they are under surveillance by the ` verfassungsschutz ' ( an institution to protect the german constitution ) because they are considered to have ` antidemocratic tendencies ' . 
  there were several unsuccessful attempts to ban this party and some scandals with undercover contact persons from police and security institutions trying to find evidence for those ` antidemocratic tendencies ' , because some of those contact persons used governmental money to fund the party and their activities ( basically being double-agents ) . 
  they are strongest in east german states where people ` lost ' from the reunion and capitalism and where the number of immigrants is the lowest . 
  we also have the green party , who are also center-left and ( obviously ) care most about environmental issues . 
  they are often a coalition partner of spd , but also sometimes of cdu . 
  ** td ; dr : ** it is complicated . 
  many people from the center-left to the left consider conservatives being somewhat right-winged , and right tendencies are believed to lead back to something like the third reich , imperialism or the war ridden historic europe . 
  many conservatives consider themselves being center , not right and do n't like being called right-winged or connected to neonazi tendencies . 
  conservatives call left winged people extremists and dangerous , and everyone calls right winged people neonazis . 
  wow , this took longer than i thought . 
  if i made mistakes , please feel free to correct me . 
  edit 2 : i really should have proof-read this comment ... 
  so many mistakes and i 'm probably still missing a lot, 
  i 'm german , and from the beginning i opposed bullfights . 
  then i spent one year in seville , where bullfighting is still a thing . 
  but it is controversial .
