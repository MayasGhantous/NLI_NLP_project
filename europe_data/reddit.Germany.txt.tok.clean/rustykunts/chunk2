  once i ate moules frites in dieppe . 
  good memories !, 
  for politicians good times never come . 
  no politicians argues for austerity or to put money aside during periods of economic expansion . 
  just look at those people shitting on sch\u00e4uble for not borrowing money despite low interest rates although he 's just following keynesian economics . 
  ( at least in the case of germany ), 
  but there are special bail-out interest rates in place for government debt in greece . 
  since 2013 greece pays around [ 8 % ] ( http://imgur.com/a/udsxa ) of revenues on interests . 
  these are the lowest interest payments as a share of revenues since 1995 ( and before ) . 
  that is affordable . 
  i really do n't get why people keep pressing about debt relief for greece because it 's cleary not the main problem right now . 
  the use of hormones in animal feed is forbidden within the eu . 
  there are only expections for livestock breeding and therapeutic purposes . 
   cow 's milk is a food acquired from animals which naturally contains hormones . 
  these include naturally occurring female sex hormones , such as progesterone , which belongs to the corpus luteum hormones , and estrogens , which are also known as follicle hormones .

  you 're simply narrow minded if you really think that militarism and ethnic superiority are key aspects of german history . 
   unless the kaiser himself was a liberal , which was not going to happen . 
  friedrich iii who ruled the kaiserreich for 99 days was widely recognised as a potenial liberal reformer for prussia and germany . 
  who knows what he would 've done if the had n't died with 57 . 
   no , but the values of a state are important for its actions and also the mindset of the population . 
  there was always this stereotype that germans were really `` obrigkeitsh\u00f6rig '' , and this was ( and maybe is ) true . 
  you can forge a state in a war and with aristocrats and then expect it to turn into a liberal utopia . 
  you should n't forget the ongoing [ process of politicisation ] ( http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/deutsche-geschichte/kaiserreich/139651/obrigkeitsstaat-und-basisdemokratisierung ) of the masses , the grassroot movement for democratisation , social reforms , the formation of the reichstag and politcal parties . 
  my point is that while militarism , ruling aristocrats and so on were a huge obstacle for liberalisation it was not impossible . 
  i disagree that the german state from 1870 was doomed from the start . 
  militarism , regressive-conservatism and authoritarian thoughts played a role in nearly every state in that period . 
  history ( or life whatever ) is not deterministic so that this leads to that . 
  the german worker class in the beginning of the last century was the biggest in europe and also highly politicized in a democratic sense . 
  the kaiserreich could have turned into more liberal state . 
  murderer of 19 year old student in freiburg was apparently convincted in greece for attacking a young woman and sentenced to 10 years in prison . 
  for whatever reason he was released after 1.5 years and made his way to germany , where he committed another serious crime . 
  moreover greek authority did n't manage to proper register him with fingerprints and so on as there was no entry in the eurodac database . 
  we keep our stolen greek gold until greece pays back its debt, 
  to put the effect of the great depression into perspective you should have a look at the german federal election 1928 - 1932 . 
  1928 : nsdap = 2.6 % 1930 : nsdap = 18.3 % 1932 : nsdap = 37.3 % so in just four years the nazi party election results went from basically zero to the single strongest party with around 40 % . 
  edgy, 
  that quote sounds a little overblown . 
  in fact it was n't so much the bombing but the rebuilding . 
  key words are here * nachkriegmoderne * and * autogerechte stadt * . 
  germany ** was ** really a magnificent place with beautiful cities . 
  comparing modern nation states to 12th century feudalism is quite retarded . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.facebook.com/alikakos/videos/10155424263773151/ ) of the confrontation . 
  living in the past like that can not be healthy for your psychological well-being . 
  hopefully you too can move on someday . 
  great movie . 
  apart from bild zeitung , no one in the media played the `` lazy southerners '' tune . 
  and never did sch\u00e4uble or merkel called greeks lazy . 
  this is a myth which keeps getting repeated over and over again . 
   but who are the perpetrators ? 
  and where does the journey of the cars go ? 
  according to the bka , the focal points of the crime lie in the border regions of brandenburg and saxony as well as in the large areas of berlin and hamburg . 
  for many years , motor vehicle crime has been dominated by east european perpetrators . 
  in international organized crime , mainly lithuanian and polish dominated groups are to be found . 
  the bka attaches a `` special importance '' to these perpetrators in international motor vehicle crime . 
   `` the eastern european countries are both important sales markets and transit countries in the international illegal motor trade , '' explains bka president j\u00f6rg ziercke . 
  the bka president speaks of a `` persistently high demand '' for cars and cars in southeast and eastern europe . 
  according to ziercke , the international car shift is now characterized by a persistently high demand even in the near and middle east .

  like [ winston 's hiccup ] ( https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/winstons-hiccup/?_r=1 ) ? 
  sounds similar to what the older generation of germans feel who were expelled from the former german territories in the east, 
  http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article153340636/wie-tsipras-das-dubiose-system-der-vorgaenger-kopiert.html google translate : initially alexis tsipras was a beacon of hope . 
  not only for many greeks . 
  even hartleibige representatives of creditor troika of the international monetary fund ( imf ) , european central bank ( ecb ) and european commission joined with the left greek premier at least one expectation : tsipras will do away with nepotism . 
  `` the times in which one hand washes the other , are over , '' a member of the troika said at the time . 
  this wishful thinking has not been fulfilled . 
  late february reported the greek newspaper `` to vima '' that the premier in the summer of 2014 - had a total hit four times with the powerful publisher stavros psycharis - before his election . 
  at the last of these meetings tsipras told the 71-year psycharis indicated debt relief for the media group , also help with the complete acquisition of mega tv , a television station key . 
  the only condition : the publications of the entrepreneur would tsipras support during the election campaign . 
  what they did not . 
  since `` to vima '' - a newspaper that belongs psycharis - reported , raging the war between the parties . 
  the office of the prime minister dismissed the allegations . 
  the report shows only that the publisher had asked a long time before the election to help : `` the prime minister promised the greek people that he is going to do anyone a favor . '', 
  dubious post award only this promise does not cover the reality . 
  under tsipras relatives , acquaintances and friends of friends are transported . 
  the cases of dubious post award are bizarre part . 
  the government , which in july will further billion by the donors at the latest depends , in the reform process back far . 
  and the eu partners who had promised more than they used to pay attention to the necessary structural reforms , not to talk publicly about these cases . 
  alexis tsipras is threatening to blockade the planned refugee summit of the european union , if not all member states are obliged to share the burden refugee crisis tsipras is threatening to blockade of eu policies example nikos karanikas : the man fell to a political friend of the prime minister . 
  he runs a website that kapriziert mainly on the praise of the government . 
  tsipras has now made him a special adviser in the `` office for strategic planning '' at the general secretariat of the prime minister . 
  the salary is reportedly 2027 euros gross per month , three times the minimum wage , has promised to tsipras during the election campaign and not enforced . 
  whether the man really is sufficiently qualified for the consultant job , seems doubtful in view his cv . 
  after greek newspaper reports , he has completed a technical school for tourism in larissa . 
  he worked then as a waiter in a bar in thessaloniki . 
  tsipras ' cousin is the secretary general of the foreign ministry favoritism is called : panagiotis pantos , syriza member and chemists , in reality editor of books and newspapers , was elected president that the economic ministry 's company , which is responsible for the implementation of european development programs . 
  perhaps only an isolated case ? 
  greek media deal in detail with the strange personnel policy which operates the syriza government . 
  in the past year has been tsipras ' cousin giorgos secretary in the foreign ministry . 
  even an isolated case ? 
  rena dourou , leading syriza member and regional president of attica , made her partner yannis benisis chief of the waterworks . 
  her brother panagiotis was bureau chief minister of culture . 
  keeping a low profile operate syriza politicians the old game of nepotism . 
  relatives and friends are not employed in their own office , but with party colleagues . 
  many individual cases are condensed into a political development . 
  the syriza officials , self-proclaimed fighters against corruption , are not better than their predecessors . 
  the comrades seize the hour and reward themselves and their friends for the years of opposition . 
  in internet now circulating supply lists . 
  names , relationships , income . 
  ifo institute : grexit would have been right in 2015 the country is economically still on the ground .
