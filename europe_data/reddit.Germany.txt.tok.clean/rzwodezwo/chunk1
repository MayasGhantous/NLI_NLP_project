that is no longer true for the past weeks and months . 
  additionally it 's basically only syrians ( and people from eritrea ? ), 
  that gain asylum rights by a high percentage . 
  ( yes i am aware of the problem that a lot of asylum seekers stay in germany for a long time after their application was rejected & think we should change that . ), 
   the-sub-that-shall-not-be-mentioned k , now i 'm curious, 
  yip . 
   people would n't care much if germany was taking in everyone , but it is n't . 
  its trying to push a lot of refugees onto other countries . 
  they can only be `` pushed in '' by an eu decision . 
  and if the qualified majority agrees that it is eu 's duty to shelter refugees you guys will have to do so . 
  this is what will happen , yep . 
  i 'm not not so deluded to think that we will just take millions of refugees every year . 
  but at the moment germany is strong and i see it as my country 's ( and the eu 's ) duty to help those in need both here and in turkey , libanon , etc. , while also seeking a solution for that fucking war much more actively . 
  great , now we 've come to the point where we call giving food and shelter `` messiah complex '' . 
  i do n't like angela merkel but on this issue i agree with her when she says `` germany is a strong country . 
  we can do this . '', 
  what i hear from friends back home ( i 'm in brazil at the moment ) makes me confident that we will be just fine . 
  a few million new fellow citizens or not . 
  there are already millions of refugees in the neighbouring countries . 
  europe is big , we can take quite a few people and we will . 
  so we leave everything to turkey ? 
  how cowardly would that be . 
   europe 's problem is that they are missing out on this modern muslim . 
  nope nope nope . 
  i have quite a few friends that perfectly fit your definition of a `` modern muslim '' . 
  not missing out anything over here . 
  59 % percent of germans feel `` relaxed '' about the situation in the country , 96 % support taking in refugees fleeing from ( civil ) war . 
  generally people in eastern germany are more fearful than their counterparts in the west by a margin of ~ 10 % . 
  sure it will . 
  and when we 're all dead and germany is a caliphate , you can proudly say that you knew it first !, 
  that 's so ridiculous i wo n't even try to reply in a serious way . 
  sorry , ca n't find it !, 
  you 're free to assume i 'm bullshitting but it was not my intention doing so . 
  pretty sure it was something 40ish . 
   that this guy `` did a quick search and could n't find much '' is completely unbelievable . 
  well , fuck you , too . 
  i will look for further ones . 
  marriage equality for homosexuals is even the official position of the `` zentralrat der muslime '' ( central council of muslims ) . 
  did a quick search and could n't find much . 
  might be , might be not . 
  my personal experience with muslims in germany has been entirely positive . 
  repost from another thread : [ muslims in germany ] ( http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/projekte/51_religionsmonitor/zusammenfassung_der_sonderauswertung.pdf ) [ study from bertelsmann stiftung in german language ] some of its key findings : - 90 % of the surveyed muslims in germany agree that `` democracy is a good polity '' - 90 % have regular leisure contact to people with different beliefs - 47 % reflect their religious beliefs `` often '' or `` very often '' compared to 36 % in turkey - 40 % of highly religious sunnis ( 69 % of less religious muslims , 60 % of somewhat religious muslims ) agree that homosexuals should be able to marry ( turkey : 12 % ) ; bertelsmann stiftung : `` the low difference in germany can carefully be interpreted as a decoupling of ethic-moral beliefs and faith intensity . '', 
  bertelsmann stiftung assumes that a small fraction of radical islamists ( < 1 % ) shape the image of the 4 million muslims in germany . 
  it identifies anti-islam sentiment as the biggest hurdle to successful integration , while at the same time concludes that muslims in germany identify with their country way more than commonly assumed : `` by now the large share of muslims are born and raised in germany . 
  germany for them is home . '', 
   suicidal immigration policies sure, 
  if you 'd rather turn away on people so clearly in need , i do n't want to be in a union with you either . 
   i do n't know though , i can take them at face value and i can take the pew and gallup polls i 've seen at face value * muslims in britain have zero tolerance towards homosexual acts compared to their counterparts in france and germany , according to a survey published today . 
  * different countries , different muslims . 
  have you lost your fucking mind ? 
  i made a short summary of that study in another thread today , if you 're interested . 
   what do you mean there is no proof that that is happening ? 
  i am basing this off long debates with muslims . 
  not all of them , of course . 
  there are plenty of lapsed-catholic style muslims , thank allah . 
  although it is admirable that you seek dialogue , this is by no means proof . 
  there are plenty of lapsed-catholic style catholics , thank christianity , i do n't really see your argument right now . 
  yes , there is . 
  for example a survey by bertelsmann stiftung from early 2015 : [ click ] ( http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/projekte/51_religionsmonitor/zusammenfassung_der_sonderauswertung.pdf ) ( german language ) some of its key findings : - 90 % of the surveyed muslims in germany agree that `` democracy is a good polity '' - 90 % have regular leisure contact to people with different beliefs - 47 % reflect their religious beliefs `` often '' or `` very often '' compared to 36 % in turkey - 40 % of highly religious sunnis ( 69 % of less religious muslims , 60 % of somewhat religious muslims ) agree that homosexuals should be able to marry ( turkey : 12 % ) ; bertelsmann stiftung : `` the low difference in germany can carefully be interpreted as a decoupling of ethic-moral beliefs and faith intensity .

   teaching the caliphate and taking over in the mosques there is no proof that this is happening . 
  fear is not a good advise in this situation , humaneness is . 
  we are not spreading anything . 
  those people are coming here because there is a war and the neighbouring countries can not cope with the millions of refugees . 
   we are importing a rather nasty form of religious brainwashing , and the crime , hate , and intolerance that comes with it . 
  and then we expect them to be our maids and live in ghettos . 
  muslims live in germany for decades now . 
  yes , there are problems and black sheep , no , i do n't agree with what the islam teaches ( i do n't agree with what christianity teaches either ) , but what usually happens is that immigrants get more western and liberal as the years pass by . 
  alright . 
  why are you angry ? 
  the amount of anti-refugee hate in this sub is unbelievable . 
  bye folks , this just makes me sad . 
  haha , whatever . 
  yes , why not spend the money to make our lifes even better , while million of syrians are suffering horribly . 
  that sounds about right to me . 
  that is not true . 
  i read yesterday that 45 % of the syrians coming to germany have higher education . 
  i ca n't find the article right now and the number might be exaggerated , but you get the idea . 
  edit : downvoting facts , that 's the spirit , reddit !, 
  wow . 
  i know it 's dangerous to read youtube and newspaper comments but until today thought r/europe would be save . 
  so much bullshit , wtf reddit . 
  i 'm no longer subscribing to r/europe because the anti-refugee cirklejerk pisses me off . 
  so i just check from time to time and found this post . 
  let me elaborate : you do n't make this choice , your teachers make it for you . 
  basically at the end of grundschule four years after you began school education you get a recommendation on which type of school to attend from your school . 
  that recommendation ( a gpa of at least 2.5 where 1 is best an 6 is worst usually is enough for the highest type of school : gymnasium ) is binding though , so you or your parents ca n't just say fuck it . 
  this may seem unfair as you pointed out , but there is always the possibility to move upwards . 
  with good grades in hauptschule you can continue eduaction to pursue realschulabschluss and again with good grades in realschule can go on to abitur without any time lost . 
  over the last years also possibilities popped up to study without the former needed abitur . 
  generally there is a lot of flexibility . 
  if you 're a smart student , you will go your way . 
  if not so much , haupt - and realschule might be better at preparing you for the german ausbildungssystem , where you go right into companies for a mix of work experience ( paid ) and tailored-for-the-job education . 
  in my opinion our system has its advantages because you can create a better suited education for most participants . 
  it sure wo n't fit everyone but from what i have experienced it is mostly fine . 
  us$ 51 + billion, 
  you guys can keep telling that to yourselves , that wo n't make it more true though . 
  nazis going bonkers is civil unrest ?
