  nobody does . 
  the df kind of !! fun !, 
  nice try , you 're not getting bohemia back . 
  ultimately , in a global economy , buyers and sellers will just cycle through and russia will buy apples from someone else . 
  boycotts only work if everyone ( who can sell ) boycotts a country . 
  suppose only europe and us wo n't supply iran with nuke tech ? 
  well , then they 'll buy it from china , pakistan or india . 
  unless production capacities exceed demand ( which is , oddly , probably true for cars or smartphones but not so much for food products ) the boycotted seller also will just sell to someone else . 
  okay , we seriously need a new rule : no more facebook links . 
  i 'd rather read something written by a ukip site as source . 
  the dutch psycho duck ? 
  sure . 
  nightmare of my childhood , right next to that italian mr. rossi . 
  who creates such horrorshows for children ? 
  if they will go through with that large scale , it might be a rude awakening for the middle and upper class . 
  i do n't see how this will not hurt putin more than help him . 
  i have two possibly funny complaints about this article : * oettinger did n't rise through the ranks of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union party - he was a state level head of government who became so unbearable and `` unelectable '' due to his incompetence and clumsy public statements that he was deported to an appointment that would hopefully be less in the public spotlight and not subject to voting him off . 
  the `` rise '' that happened in his career was mostly due to those above him fighting among and `` removing '' themselves . 
  his incompetence in digital matters is proverbial . 
  * i am suddenly a supporter of a monopolist google if it means d\u00f6pfner and the evil axel springer empire will be destroyed by it . 
  maybe google is actually more evil but the axel springer empire is much better at being it openly and despicably so . 
  that 's too bad to be auto translation . 
  i think you actually speak german . 
  i know the karlsruhe , mannheim and freiburg areas . 
  i got the impression stores are actually closed * earlier * in freiburg than in smaller towns surrounding it . 
  i recall some rewe and edeka opened till 10 but anything else closes earlier . 
  do n't get your hopes up for ba-w\u00fc . 
  very few are opened til 22:00 , none longer . 
  i hate you . 
  we * all * hate you . 
  ^ ^ my ^ ^ tram ^ ^ sometimes ^ ^ runs ^ ^ 5 ^ ^ minutes ^ ^ late, 
  control . 
  bosses want control . 
  yes , they do n't have it anyway , everybody is redditing , but they want to see their slaves . 
  the public transport i mostly use to get to work is excellent . 
  however , my connection takes 1-2h instead of < 30min . 
  ( actual journey time ) because some idiot decided to let the train sit in a station for most of that time - or there is no connection at all where i have to change trains . 
  something like niemiecki ? 
  hey wait . 
  that 's hwala , right ? 
  and that means thanks , right ? 
  i speak serbian !, 
  hehehe . 
  we are on to you little eesti . 
  you could have just said `` morgen abend geh ich pizzas backen in meinem steinofen . '', 
  but no , you have to pretend you are a separate language . 
  well , at least no one will say germany can not into bridge building that way :p, 
  each new vid just reaffirms my stance of staying away from that , not running towards it . 
  looks like there 's still pressure and tension that could snap any time this way or that way . 
  meh , ever since reddit it 's just `` cute little eesti '' in my head , no more estland . 
  so makedonia is for a full grexit then ? 
  i sympathize with any whistleblower and netzpolitik.org but this is no-news . 
  these guys made a `` secret '' very dry , boring and abstract paper on how to restructure and refinance online surveillance public and a state 's attorney looked into if this could be considered treason - quickly deciding ` no ' . 
  at best this is imprecise but it might be just wrong . 
  as a german , we get off pretty well , all considered . 
  no complaints . 
  awesome, 
  i knew it would be this but it 's actually a tad worse than i thought . 
  i stay away like hell from these places . 
  also , i 'd like to apologize for my people . 
  maybe it 's all brits ? 
  you mean `` long time lurker , first time moving to europe , be gentle pls '', 
  so much popcorn news this week, 
  ha haha hahahaha . 
  so funny, 
  looks like it works in germany http://www.moskau-inkasso.com/, 
  well , you 're from russia, 
  njet ? 
  because austria spent centuries laying down some top notch infrastructure that 's still there . 
  i 'll show myself out ... 
  come to estonia !, 
  lots of space , free housing ; we are all in finland , norway , ireland etc. 
  ( at least that 's the impression you get from the interwebs ), 
   polish  have a honest job scnr edit : hey !, 
  can anyone provide sources that say pkk broke the ceasefire first ? 
  wait , you * want * the balkans ?? 
  makedonia ? 
  bosnia ? 
  serbia ? 
  see , my theory is the polish cavalry had nothing to do with the siege of vienna . 
  it went more like this : `` so we want to take vienna ? '', 
  `` yes . '', 
  `` and keep it ? '', 
  `` yes . '', 
  `` but . . that would mean putting up with makedonia , bosnia , serbia , albania etc too ? '', 
  `` yes . '', 
  `` you know , on second thought , let 's just go home . '', 
  it 's always good populism to talk about how some evil other nations took away territory that was rightfully yours , remind people what a glorious empire they were and that it 's time to take it back . 
  i mean , the founding mythos of modern turkey is essentially reversing the [ treaty_of_s\u00e8vres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_s\u00e8vres ) . 
  why not go a little further ? 
  syria and iraq ( which were n't even states before ) were part of turkey until 1918 . 
  on a more pragmatic note , oil . 
  edit : on second thought , preventing a kurdistan that starts nibbling away at eastern turkey territory . 
  which is probably exactly what is happening right now . 
  i wonder when turkey will decide to just factually anschluss whatever parts of syria and iraq they want back . 
  nato 's hands are tied , u.s. 's hands are tied , israel probably gives a fuck , russia would be happy about the validation of its own tactics and it would give akp a guaranteed patriotic 50 % + vote for the next elections . 
  well , clearly they could n't cut down that beautiful tree !, 
  this looks more like a commute in the us ... 
  looks like italy , sounds like italy , why would n't it have crooks like italy ? 
  you can claim the ` civilized ' perk anytime you like - just play the ` part of the glorious austro-german empire ' card at the beginning of your turn .
