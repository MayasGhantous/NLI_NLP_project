  yes . 
  but , these are insignifcant in number . 
   go to the indian neighbourhood in paris or the chinese one , i 'll let you guess if all the people around you have master degrees . 
  there will always be indian and chinese everywhere but what percentage of the ones coming to france in 2016 are the cheap labor , you talk about ? 
  let me tell you - france is nowhere on the list of indians after the us , uk . 
  heck , even the uk is lost on it . 
  currently , the most sought after countries are germany , netherlands and switzerland . 
  do n't conflate the current refugee situation with immigration . 
  if you think that europe selects ( or would select ) a lot of uneducated immigrants , you 're in for a huge surprise . 
  there are many barriers that prevent people from india to come to europe - ( 1 ) language , ( 2 ) limited opportunities and ( 3 ) salaries . 
  even if one were to overcome ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) is the main issue . 
  this is the reason people from india would much rather immigrate to middle eastern countries where they could send money back home to their families rather than come to europe and pay into the social security system . 
  beyond this , the lack of true free movement between european countries for labor is even more problematic . 
  add to all this the difficulty in obtaining a visa if you are not skilled enough , this so called uneducated immigrants that you think of is completely non-existent . 
  words are cheap . 
  we are talking about immigration in 2016 not after the * great * post colonial eras . 
  most immigration from indians and chinese in 2016 happens via education . 
  but , it 's not surprising because simple facts are generally lost on xenophobic bigots . 
  are you going to airlift these poor people of india and china ? 
   japan is ** fairly apprehensive ** to immigration and foreign ethnicities as it is that is so mild . 
  japan is outright xenophobic . 
   no it is society since in the current system you ca n't really afford children unless either one partner makes exceptionally more than the average what do you mean by society here ? 
  i think this is about money and economic policies - not society . 
   why not bring in indian , chinese , whatever else you can think of ? 
  indian and chinese citizens are quite the opposite of cheap labor . 
  if you look at the us immigration statistics , you 'd know why . 
   has the average citizen benefited at all from islamic immigration to france ? 
  you tell me . 
  what percentage of the so called `` islamic immigrants '' provided cheap labor and paid into the social security system ? 
  if they were not paying their taxes , what were the french investigation agencies doing ? 
   there is a difference between state sanctioned discrimination and individual discrimination you know i 'm surprised people do n't get this simple fact . 
   that 's just bullshit . 
  nein , i have met many people in germany with that attitude . 
  it 's beyond `` unable to talk proper german '' or whatever the hell `` proper german '' means . 
  it 's difficult for him to not take it personal after it has happened repeatedly from different experiences across different people . 
  absolutely !, 
  if you want highly skilled people to come in over , contribute to your society - expect to shift a bit too . 
  culture is not a static concept or entity , there are and will be changes . 
  cultural integration is a 2-way street . 
  sure , the person who moved all the way to germany has to make 80 % of the effort but there 's also a 20 % effort need to be made by germans . 
  the perfect example was the guy whom i 'm replying to . 
  another example would be to just not be a prick about language . 
  for example , if someone from another country comes to germany and speaks in english : if you can , help that guy - there 's no force but if you can be nice . 
  too often i 've noticed , `` you come to germany , you speak in german . 
  even if i know english , i would not . 
  you are an idiot '' . 
  that sort of an attitude just alienates people who even want to learn german and integrate into the society . 
  remember , being born in germany or anywhere else is not by design but by chance . 
  it 's sad how cultural integration ( which is used almost in a xenophobic , racist way ) becomes a 1-way street . 
  germany needs to learn to adapt to other cultures too . 
  i 'm not saying that germany needs to make the effort but a couple of steps when the other person is taking 8 would not hurt . 
   having government-commissioned software under an open licence seems completely reasonable and natural , considering we just decided that ** all eu funded scientific publications have to be freely accessible . 
  ** this is actually even worse than earlier . 
  now , under the guise of open access you 'd have to pay more money to the publishers to keep it open . 
  basically , publishers take more money to keep research articles public which is paid by public money . 
   but my ancestors and culture have been here for hundreds of years ...  so either fully intergrate or move to a muslim country . 
  lets use this same logic . 
  please fully integrate into africa or just move off from earth . 
  since , that is where we came from . 
  i have never understood down votes . 
  why are they even needed ? 
  just up votes are enough to check out interesting content . 
  i fantasize the day when people do not expect their administrative bodies to show bat . 
   your misanthropy is showing . 
  huh ? 
  spiegel is wrong this time . 
   there has n't been an official statement made by merkel or any spokesperson , at least as far as i know . 
  the [ official statement ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/armenien-resolution-109.html ) denies the spiegel article . 
  do n't forget to read the comments here . 
  it 's gold , jerry !, 
  it is funny to see the entire comment thread justify or oppose something that never happened . 
  read below to see a live experiment in human bias . 
  information about [ net neutrality rules in eu ] ( http://berec.europa.eu/eng/net/ ), 
  let me lay out for you . 
  germany has taken a large cohort of immigrants from turkey - one of the most secular muslim countries on the planet . 
  they have been there for 50 years . 
  ** some of them ** are still inclined to go into the streets and chant for an islamist dictator . 
  germany is currently taking a far larger cohort of ~ ~ immigrants ~ ~ ** refugees ** ( there are immigrants from countries as secular or even more than germany too ) from countries far less secular than turkey . 
  how do you picture this looking 50 years from now ? 
  ~ ~ i think everyone can basically see it but you . ~ ~ i think everyone can see that some of them will be problematic . 
  but , no - let us use this to take a dump on every person who 's come to germany . 
  after all , ** some of us ** are closet bigots . 
  the current protests have got nothing to do with refugees from turkey or from syria . 
  i see no details about the poll . 
  therefore , 600 may or may not be representative . 
   provided that the metdhology and weightings are reasonable . 
  i ca n't see that - therefore , skepticism . 
  regressive , anyone ? 
   a poll of ** 600 ** people published by the ** oesterreich tabloid ** i would take this poll with a bottle of salt . 
  if you can not see that i do not disagree with what you said but was merely pointing out that this has got nothing to do with recent refugees , i really do n't know what to say . 
  you conflated racism to being afraid . 
   this is actually a really shitty article filled with platitudes that actually does not go anywhere scientific i hope scientists are scientific enough [ race is a social construct , scientists argue ] ( http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/ ), 
  it 's interesting how people always want a `` pillow '' to put all their sorrow on . 
  * turks rallying for erdogan vs gullen - merkel and her refugee policy * deutsche bank faces problems - merkel and her refugee policy * mold in my house - merker and her refugee policy i rather stop reading reddit these days . 
  the change of `` merkel and her refugee policy '' coming up as a problem for every god damn thing under the roof is very high . 
  so basically , it is ok to be racist to a religion - if you are afraid of a religion ? 
  yes . 
   as in she knew that it would cause problems but did it anyway ** for cheap workforce ** , etc ? 
  yes, 
  it 's scary to see fundamentalists trying to trump the narrative in europe .
