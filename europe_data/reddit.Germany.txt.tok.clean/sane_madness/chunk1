there is more than liberal democracy standing in the way . 
  even if we ignore ideological differences , there is still the issue of russia being a kleptocracy . 
  which sane person is going to invest long term in russia ? 
  yeah the pis is suspiciously close to putin \u00b4 s party line . 
  but this is conspiracy territory i guess . 
  makes sense . 
  norway is probably the arctic rival that is the easiest to tackle ... 
  you raise very good points . 
  but i still think they would actually hate it if the spd takes over . 
  not just for propaganda . 
  the spd is much softer on russia than they could possibly be comfortable with . 
  kaczynski actually did a pr-tour for nuclear weapons in a german newspaper ... 
  he also said it would be a catastrophe if merkel wouldn \u00b4 t be reelected . 
  i think this pacifist attitude of the spd is the very reason for his sudden change of mind . 
  although he loves to have his underlings bitch over the western neighbour for propaganda reasons , it seems he is realistic enough to know , it \u00b4 s the other neighbours army he has to worry about . 
  no it would not . 
  there was a german documentary a while ago about how russian intelligence brings chechnyan islamists on purpose into germany to undermine islamic communities . 
  the only thing they did according to the documentary back then was staging protests for the purpose of sending those pictures of `` unrest '' in germany back to russia . 
  they also snitched on real chechnyan refugees in germany . 
  so there is no proof i know of that those russian agents carried out or at least supported actual attacks . 
  but there is proof for russian agents undermining those circles ... 
  according to the source in the documentary germany is not the only place for this russian strategy ... edit : [ link ] ( https://www.zdf.de/dokumentation/zdfzoom/zdfzoom-putins-kalter-krieg-100.html ) for those who want to see it for themselves . 
  it \u00b4 s a zdf-documentary . 
  sadly only in german . 
  but for those who understand german , it \u00b4 s pretty interesting ... 
  if true , this sounds really bad . 
  i hope you \u00b4 ll get the truth of it soon . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  so this suggests that there are too many voters ? 
  stupid german here with no clue about serbian politics . 
  may i ask , what numbers you are talking about and what doesn \u00b4 t add up ? 
  you \u00b4 re right of course the outdated words and different meaning is a much bigger hurdle to climb than the syntax . 
  i just thought my experience with the syntax is quite fitting to the topic here  . 
  i was very flashed by a video i saw a while ago , where an actor pronounced shakespeare the way it would have sounded back then . 
  absolutely amazing . 
  yep . 
  thou hast - du hast you have - sie haben nothing to see here really , 
  i still haven \u00b4 t seen a single pic of a monument lit in german colors because of the berlin attack . 
  this european solidarity thing doesn \u00b4 t seem worth much then . 
  at least if you take lighting up buildings as something important . 
  which i don \u00b4 t. 
  on another note it is ( regardless of real world issues ) in my opinion not very healthy for russian , american or german citizens to expect other people to like them or even care for them . 
  when i had to read shakespeare in school , i didn \u00b4 t even realize that the syntax was a bit off from a modern english point of view . 
  i was still in the stage , where i translated english into german to understand it . 
  so there was nothing out of the ordinary to me . 
  btw . 
  if you want this sentence to sound natural you should pepper it with some modal particles : habt ihr sp\u00e4ter noch etwas vor ? 
   have you later still something planned ? 
  well then it just slipped my attention . 
  but i still think , it \u00b4 s weird to try and decide who is `` in '' and `` out '' depending on some lights ... 
  serious question here : did anyone light up monuments because of the berlin christmas market attack ? 
  i can \u00b4 t remember any . 
  maybe it just slipped my attention . 
  if indeed nothing was lit in solidarity . 
  does that mean germany is not part of europe ? 
  i think we shouldn \u00b4 t put too much thought in this stuff . 
  there is a time and place to discuss such things . 
  i \u00b4 d say this is neither the right time nor the right place . 
  i will never understand why some people just want to kill others . 
  this is so sad . 
  please stay safe russians . 
  `` he said the centre would also develop and war-game offensive capabilities because `` in order to be able to defend yourself , you have to know the options for attack '' . '', 
  we \u00b4 ll be gaining offensive capabilities just for ... \u00e4h ... research purposes and such ... you have to love those intelligence guys ... 
  well i \u00b4 m glad you responded . 
  i \u00b4 m all for a common european defense army and a bigger defense budget . 
  i \u00b4 m also for less military spending in the us . 
  don \u00b4 t get me wrong . 
  but you shouldn \u00b4 t expect the us-military budget to go down as a response of rising european spending . 
  it \u00b4 s too lucrative for american politicians to spend money on the military . 
  but it \u00b4 s also a great deflection to tell the populace it \u00b4 s because of those mooching europeans ... as long as your people believe this bs the military budget will keep rising . 
  btw europeans already have their own military-industrial complex . 
  it just isn \u00b4 t as powerful as in the us . 
  ( yet ), 
  germany needs to be scary ? 
  i \u00b4 m pretty sure , the rest of europe disagrees . 
  what ? 
  you are mixing us up with the angelsachsen ( anglo-saxons ) ? 
  btw we use this term too . 
  we commonly talk of the anglosaxon sphere , if they try to deregulate the markets again . 
  [ als ich fortging ( cover by elif ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7v0idmb_4 ) `` when i went away '' quote : nothing is eternal just accept it . 
  i know you want to be eternal - weak and small . 
  nothing is enduring - if no one really wants it . 
  well i guess for putin it is a big deal . 
  he lived through the collapse of the soviet union in eastern germany . 
  he knows how protests can get out of control [ these ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/montagsdemonstrationen_1989/1990_in_der_ddr#entwicklung_der_teilnehmerzahlen_in_leipzig ) are the numbers of how the monday protests swelled in leipzig a city of half a million from 1200 to almost the whole city . 
  [ here is a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nktan7ptac ) of the protests . 
  you can see how the mass of people just goes on and on . 
  that \u00b4 s what it looks like when things get out of control for a totalitarian regime . 
  and putin knows this first hand . 
  the question is , what did he learn from his experiences in eastern germany ? 
  how will he react ? 
  will he try and put this fire out , before it actually burns . 
  i would think so . 
  he probably doesn \u00b4 t take chances with this stuff . 
  edit : i also don \u00b4 t think a majority of russians wants to protest . 
  but even so i think , putin will not like any demonstrations at all . 
  exactly . 
  i \u00b4 d never cast my vote for any party if there is a chance they could do a coalition with linke . 
  i \u00b4 m surprised though with the result of the greens . 
  and amused with fdp .
