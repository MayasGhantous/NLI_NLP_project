  those companies normally count every feedback as a stand in for a certain amount of people who have the same complaint . 
  also tell your friends and family members to do the same thing if they are unhappy with such things . 
  this is exactly what makes dm and aldi the top dogs in their respective markets in germany they constantly ask their customers for feedback and they react according to it . 
  ( you have no idea what kind of stuff big companies are willing to do for a spot in the aldi market . 
   i could imagine that companies and retailers don \u00b4 t have the need to do this out of their own need to distinguish themselves yet in your still developing markets . 
  but they will react if you start complaining . 
  they will be taking negative feedback seriously . 
  this is what capitalism forces them to do . 
  use the power you have as a customer . 
  also start looking at ingredient lists . 
  if there is shady shit in it : don \u00b4 t buy . 
  look at this site for example ( it \u00b4 s in german although i \u00b4 d be surprised if there isn \u00b4 t an english counterpart ) : http://www.codecheck.info/ you can type products in it to see the ingredients and they color code the worrisome ingredients . 
  people actually use this when buying cosmetics . 
  if the product you are searching for isn \u00b4 t found in the database they ask you to copy the ingredients in yourself and they will provide a check of them instantly . 
  start such a website in your own language . 
  it really helps make the customers more informed . 
  because someone named head and shoulders as an example . 
  this is what codecheck has to say about it : http://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/haarpflege/shampoo/ean_5410076553822/id_21290068/head_shoulders_for_men_500_ml.pro i \u00b4 m sure you don \u00b4 t need to understand german to see the difference to a product such as this : http://www.codecheck.info/kosmetik_koerperpflege/haarpflege/shampoo/ean_4010355852144/id_327406/alverde_feuchtigkeits_shampoo_aloe_vera_hibiskus.pro both are shampoos that go for under 2 euros ... edit : you could even use this site and add the czech-version or slovakian-version . 
  it would even provide for a direct comparison with its german counterparts . 
  may actually be a very good way to show the differences to people in all kinds of countries ... 
  because those national governments react to sizeable protest in their respective countries . 
  it \u00b4 s what happens sometimes in democracies . 
  i \u00b4 m not willing to make an assessment of how close to reality those fears are . 
  but they are there and a fertile ground for left parties and organizations . 
  there are people here who think this is meant to destroy our environment , poison our food and destabilize our financial and economic systems . 
  i do think there is some overreacting going on . 
  but there are also legitimate concerns . 
  and they often translate into usable catchphrases . 
  for example : `` chlorh\u00fchnchen '' is one often used in the german media . 
  it \u00b4 s a bad example in my opinion because if you give na to cl you come out with simple salt . 
  but people are still afraid . 
  and there are political forces who like to ride that wave of insecurity . 
  edit : the chances of ceta are now that trump has pulled out probably much better . 
  people aren \u00b4 t really afraid of canada taking over . 
  i guess you \u00b4 re talking about ceta ? 
  the deal was seen as the test version of the ttip . 
  people were mainly against ttip . 
  there were worries about too much influence of big oil , big money , big investors/corporations . 
  people were angry about food security which was seen as under attack . 
  there were environmental issues and so forth . 
  it was basically viewed as an attempt to bring the corporate coup that was going on in the states to europe . 
  so people fought against ceta because it was seen as the first step towards what some regarded as dystopian vision of a hostile take over through big american corporations . 
  if canadians want this deal . 
  it would be probably a good idea to talk to the european people and tell them that you neither want to poison them , nor to undermine state power for deregulation purposes of the financial markets or environmental protection . 
  there were actual worries that corporations would be allowed to go around laws and regulations meant to protect the health and well being of europeans for simple convience in making more money . 
  if trudeau is not able to defuse those fears i \u00b4 d say even canadians should be worried . 
  but many soldiers aren \u00b4 t for defense in europe . 
  they are there , because it is a handy platform to go into the middle east . 
  that \u00b4 s not purely done to safeguard europe or the united states . 
  i \u00b4 m convinced , there are financial interests behind it too . 
  have you ever listened to one of those speeches with the tenor of american specialness ? 
  us foreign policy does seem fond of a chaotic middle east . 
  in the shadows they whisper of an empire build on oil , free trade and very obedient allies ... and if europe would pay more money for it \u00b4 s military . 
  this would surely lead to more spending in infrastructure , education and health care in the u.s. yes ? 
  i \u00b4 m not saying this to make anyone angry . 
  but i have the feeling this discussion is oversimplified quite a bit . 
  and pretty loaded with emotions . 
  germany at least is raising it \u00b4 s budget . 
  did your politicians promise more money to your schools because of it ? 
  your politicians do the same thing , the european politicians are doing . 
  they scapegoat europe for their failings . 
  i do think , europe should pay more money into it \u00b4 s military . 
  but i also do think , it is an easy way out for your politicians who weren \u00b4 t interested at all in the well being of the american people , while they took the money from the lobbyists . 
  it is so easy after all to just point the finger elsewhere . 
  are they listed as chemical or biological weapons ? 
  it wasn ` t only reddit though . 
  in a time before trump got elected in the us many international media were somewhat losing it over the sachsen-anhalt election . 
  there more voters voted either linke or afd than spd . 
  what most international observers seemingly overlooked is , that sachsen-anhalt is one of the `` new '' states . 
  afd and linke ( authoritarian leaning in my humble opinion ) consistantly poll higher in the east than in the west . 
  but the easterners have one advantage/disadvantage ( depending on your opinion ... ) that their fellow eastern-block buddies in russia , hungary or poland don \u00b4 t have . 
  they are bundled with the old ( much larger ) states for general elections . 
  which means even if the afd gains momentum there , bavaria or nrw alone can put enough weight on the scale to counterbalance these tendencies . 
  it \u00b4 s time to get worried , if the afd/linke starts getting more votes than spd or cdu/csu in nrw or bavaria ... until then our east is stuck with democracy for better or worse . 
  election results of the last sachsen-anhalt election : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/landtagswahl_in_sachsen-anhalt_2016, 
  i 'd say this price belongs to naples ... 
   also wtf is doing the usa flag there ? 
  it \u00b4 s red and white and stars on blue ground . 
  it \u00b4 s more economic than two seperate flags . 
  inside of the eu erasmus is the biggest exchange program and it seems they have an world-wide sister program called erasmus mundus . 
  i 'd try to contact them . 
  you may also ask in your university if they have anything to do with such programs . 
  or you could choose a country you \u00b4 re interested in and ask in the embassy . 
   website of erasmus mundus : http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/index_en.php good luck , 
   what can a young argentinian , who has an eu citizenship , do to meet people from europe , travel and work there ? 
  i \u00b4 m not sure what you are doing right now . 
  but if you study you could do an exchange year in europe . 
  we have affordable universities in amazing cities and you would have the chance to live here without commiting to anything . 
  exchanges are also a good way to deepen relations between people . 
  recently erdogan called specifically the dutch nazis . 
  that was , what i was alluding to . 
  joke is n't really on the dutch . 
  it 's called projection and seems to be something pretty fashionable right now . 
  i can do that . 
  that \u00b4 s very obviously a divide and conquer-strategy by the dutch . 
  don \u00b4 t believe it !, 
  seriously that \u00b4 s getting uncanny . 
  well that \u00b4 s actually pretty german of you . 
  i \u00b4 m conflicted . 
  shouldn \u00b4 t it be levensruim or something similar ?
