  you \u00b4 re of course also right , that it \u00b4 s not a very good plan to come to germany if your only skill is speaking german . 
  and i hear prague is extremely lovely . 
  i just replied to the user above implying that the language is one of the two major problems . 
  i just don \u00b4 t think it is . 
   have a nice day . 
  i \u00b4 d say it \u00b4 s a given , that a nice job in v4 countries would enable a better life there than a minimum wage job in germany . 
  employers also generally like people who are able to speak several languages . 
  so the more languages one has in his/her portfolio the better . 
  i guess i \u00b4 m missing something about your comment ? 
  you could also ask : why doesn \u00b4 t everybody on earth just speak chinese ? 
  well if there would be a conflict in the baltic ( which i don \u00b4 t really believe it will ) then sweden actually holds the key to dominate the whole pond . 
  gotland is in the middle of it and if you would want to invade something on baltic shores it \u00b4 s a very good position . 
  it also is a good position to defend the baltic sea from . 
  sweden is kinda neutral . 
  but if russia would be invading anyone in the baltic . 
  it would be an attack against the eu which would obviously involve sweden . 
  again . 
  i don \u00b4 t think putin will attack anyone in the eu anytime soon . 
  but perhaps he thinks it \u00b4 s good to destabilize the owner of gotland if he can do it with so little effort . 
  he is an opportunist after all and if such an opportunity presents itself ... edit : word choice, 
  lowering the german proficiency requirements isn \u00b4 t helping anyone . 
  we already have enough people here who are barely able to have conversation in german . 
  which means the requirements can \u00b4 t be this hard actually . 
  and there are enough people out there learning german as second language . 
  there even are still pockets of native speakers outside the country which could perhaps be targeted in some advertising campaign ... learning another language is also not the most daunting of tasks . 
  as long as you want to learn it and keep doing it , you will be able to . 
  just out of curiosity : have you ever tried to learn another language ? 
  yes and on top of that : we don \u00b4 t need no over ~ ~ sea ~ ~ land-territories . 
  it \u00b4 s worthless for us . 
  make it the fourth baltic republic . 
  that would solve the problems with the missiles and spare us ( and probably the inhabitants ) the headache  . 
  edit : formating, 
   plus i think they still are haunted by schr\u00f6der . 
  not just for his reforms but also by his love story with putin ... 
  this was what you quoted , this was what i answered to with the russian connection . 
  as i said i \u00b4 m sorry i wasn \u00b4 t clear enough . 
  i wasn \u00b4 t clear enough . 
  the russian-connection was in my mind in the context of my earlier comment on schr\u00f6der and putin . 
  i \u00b4 m still thinking of the nice job he got after he lost the chancellorship whenever someone like gabriel or steinmeier demands better relations with russia . 
  so i didn \u00b4 t meant the whole spd has a connection . 
  i think schulz isn \u00b4 t to fond of russia for example . 
  i \u00b4 m still wary that \u00b4 s all . 
  more so than with the greens or cdu for example . 
  i really didn \u00b4 t expect a fdp-cdu coalition here . 
  and i also didn \u00b4 t hope for one . 
  but i \u00b4 m willing to give them a chance ( if linke is really out ) . 
  let \u00b4 s see what they can do . 
  and it might be a good thing for spd and gr\u00fcne to be in opposition . 
  they \u00b4 d be able to make up their minds about what they want for the future . 
  very good news . 
  although it \u00b4 s still just estimates yes ? 
  i don \u00b4 t know , how close the 4,9 are to 5 right now ... how many votes are counted ? 
  yes spd lacks real ideas . 
  they just try their old trick over and over ... and the russian connection plays still a role for me at least . 
  maybe not for many others though . 
   the border crossings to nrw start to look like the border crossings with belgium . 
  mean burn . 
  well that \u00b4 s good . 
  and lol at linke ... hopefully they won \u00b4 t get in ... 
  plus i think they still are haunted by schr\u00f6der . 
  not just for his reforms but also by his love story with putin ... 
  they also lack anything resembling a plan . 
  and they are being sucked dry by the now eternal grand coalition . 
  and they ( as far as i \u00b4 m aware ) haven \u00b4 t said anything about their stand on red red green . 
  which may hurt them too . 
  many voters from the center aren \u00b4 t too comfortable with die linke ... 
  if he ever wants to build a wall let us know , we \u00b4 ll pay for it ... , 
  brexit burned those bridges . 
  it \u00b4 s what brexit means . 
  you only got your will in the eu so far , because you were a member . 
  but soon you \u00b4 re not and at this point it isn \u00b4 t the responsibility of the eu anymore to keep you happy . 
  this isn \u00b4 t resentment , bad will or punishment . 
  it \u00b4 s reality ... edit : wording, 
  i actually watched an interesting ted-video about prisons in the us and germany . 
  i wasn \u00b4 t to fond of the presenter and i had the feeling , he had at the same time a bias against germans and a to rosy picture of us which is enough to make my head spin ... 
  but he showed some figures of incarceration rates comparing the us with the rest of the western world and it was seriously one of the scariest things i \u00b4 ve seen . 
  it seems that crime rates are kinda rising and falling due to global trends . 
  but only the us has risen its prison population constantly . 
  and it didn \u00b4 t seem to have an effect on crime rates . 
  when the numbers of committed crimes fell in the us they also fell in canada and europe . 
  and the other countries didn \u00b4 t put more people away . 
  it shouldn \u00b4 t be profitable to lock people up . 
  really scary stuff . 
  and another dark irony in the land of the free ... edit : my point is : it doesn \u00b4 t seem to be instability or actual crimes that rise your incarceration rates ... 
  you could invent one . 
  verriss is hard to translate . 
  it literally means something like a `` misrip '' . 
  that \u00b4 s kinda sad . 
  they probably would have needed some help i guess . 
  but i still don \u00b4 t really get it . 
  and i actually had a grandfather who was from the breslau-area ... 
  i hope for your sake , that you filed an official complaint in advance to put the occupying authorities on notice about your act of civil disobediance . 
  edit : spelling, 
  lol . 
  well in this case we germans actually have a word for what we \u00b4 re looking at : [ verriss ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/verriss ) an overly scathing and biased review which doesn \u00b4 t really tell you anything about the quality of the reviewed piece . 
  although it is very telling about the reviewer . 
  it is actually kinda an artform in and on itself ... and this one is low effort at best . 
  are they still active ? 
  i thought , they are kinda dying out ... 
  i don \u00b4 t get their obsession ...
