how about linking to the oc ? 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icoo7ut1p4y ) . 
  i doubt he understands how the internet works . 
  only the champions survive in finland . 
  in german , i say `` f\u00fcnf euro '' . 
  in english , i say `` five euros '' . 
  roman empire buddies ? 
  i 've never been to ireland , so i could n't give it a ` love ' : /, 
  http://i.imgur.com/h98jvbk.jpg i 've mixed a few different criteria for mine , e.g. 
  `` does this country have a positive influence on the world '' , `` would i want to live there '' , `` do i like this country '' , etc. 
  and the romanian police does n't care enough to check up on their registration ? 
  but there were at least 100 million before !, 
  why do they all have cars with german number plates ? 
  i 'd say putin . 
  i 'd love high quality prints of those . 
  not sure why you 're getting downvoted . 
  my parents went to the monday demonstrations in leipzig . 
  initially , they were * exclusively * about civil liberties , freedom of travel , etc. 
  only later did they become about unification . 
  at that point , my parents stopped attending . 
  define what you mean by ` prop up ' . 
  military subsidies for member states ? 
  * set minimal defence spending for member states ? 
  * hell no . 
  * create an eu army and reduce the size of member state 's armies ? 
  * yes please !, 
  * the amount of money spent on defence in the whole eu is more than enough . 
  we just need to distribute it more effectively . 
  the military industry should n't get more than it currently does . 
  this whole ukraine conflict with russia is just playing into their arms . 
  pictometer ? 
  is that like a scottish meter ? 
   islamists in the philippines have threatened to kill two german hostages unless germany pays a ransom [ ... ] . 
  here 's to hoping they do n't pay . 
  rewarding hostage-taking begets more hostage-taking . 
  looking at catalonia , the polling suggests an absolute majority * for * independence since 2013 . 
  what does `` devo max '' mean ? 
  you have some of the best rail service i 've ever had the pleasure of using . 
  and the generalabonnement is also not as horrendously expensive as the bahncard 100 ( 6000 $ + iirc ) . 
  holy shit that 's soon . 
  extrajudicial killings * are * chaos . 
  has there been any sort of comment from the admins on this ? 
  i do n't see anything about geodefaults in / r/announcements or / r/changelog . 
  i think it 'd be cool to have / r/de and / r/deutschland as defaults in germany ( and / r/de default too in austria and switzerland too in addition to their own , if they 're not too allergic to being grouped in with us teutons ) . 
   superiority of the aryan race \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  your analysis is way off . 
  first of all , i as a european have no idea what you refer to as `` swiss style '' . 
  such a thing does n't exist in europe imo . 
  the most famous cheeses from switzerland are gruy\u00e8re / greyerzer , emmentaler and tilsiter . 
  these are well-established names for a certain kind of cheese ( and are in no way mutually similar ) . 
  note , e.g. 
  tilsit is actually in former east prussia . 
  so it 's not abou place-names themselves , but rather the place-names being bound to a very specific sort of cheese . 
  i know well that when cheeses are imitated , they usually do n't taste nearly as well as the original . 
  hence , americans should n't just be allowed to create their own versions of european cheeses under the same name , which might just end up reimported to europe ... 
  if they are just bound to their own domestic market , and do n't infringe any protected brand names , i say let them do what they want . 
  flair up . 
  i assume you 're talking about the us ?

  what does this have to do with op 's post ? 
  \\* main * electricity * power source . 
  that 's a big difference . 
  edit , to clarify : most people are quick to forget that a very small part of the total energy consumed by a society is electricity . 
  most is consumed for heating and transport in the form of oil and gas . 
  i beg to differ . 
  i 've been against this law ever since it was passed and / r/europe was celebrating what a glorious day this was for europe . 
  i think so too .

  there 's also [ vita-cola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vita_cola ) in the east . 
  sure , but it 's still more of a hivemind thing than logic . 
  the anti-russian circlejerk in this thread is quite astonishing, 
  \\  bnp \\  left wing ahahaa, 
  just a sidenote : pds stands for ` partei des demokratischen sozialismus ' ( party of democratic socialism ), 
  i think the better question is how it * stayed * part of the culture . 
  arena fights like this were part of many cultures in europe . 
  that 's yet another ` slippery slope ' . 
  when does a person become a ` public figure ' ? 
  it 's an undefined term in european law !, 
  i 'd even argue that due to this legislation and all the press coverage it has gotten , mr gonz\u00e1lez * has * become a public figure .

  again , i 'm pretty sure it 's just because you 're used to it . 
  i do n't know anyone in germany that has trouble differentiating between ` million ' ( million ) and ` milliarde ' ( billion ) , the latter also usually being the largest number used in everyday language . 
  if you had grown up with the long system and it was primarily used around the world , i suspect you 'd be arguing for it . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  in both systems you can express numbers above and below 10 ^ ( 12 ) . 
  in what way is it more useful , exactly ? 
  this is similar to the ( equally pointless ) argument that fahrenheit is better than celsius because `` it matches human temperature sensitivity better '' , when in reality it 's just because you 're used to the fahrenheit scale . 
  [ ahem .

  fbi also does counter-intelligence and other stuff . 
  since you can fast forward into the future , i 'm not too sure it 's live tracking , but rather a visualisation of the timetable . 
   lack of a `` federal '' police force i think [ europol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europol ) is supposed to fill that role . 
  yeah , i side with the west in many things regarding russia/ukraine , but sometimes it 's just pathetic how everyone tries to spin everything in their favour .
