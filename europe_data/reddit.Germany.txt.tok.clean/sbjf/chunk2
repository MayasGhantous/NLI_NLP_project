  no wonder everything 's going down the drain !, 
  what ? 
  it 's spelt ` receive ' in both languages . 
  how 's siebenb\u00fcrgen these days ? 
  well , either that or the rep party ( basically nazis ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/a/1ty4h ) the actual ballot for germany . 
  ( c ) potatocam, 
  it 's our secret superpower , but you were n't supposed to find out :(, 
  not to start a debate , but compound words actually make more sense than the inconsistent way it 's done in english . 
  do you see a connection ? 
  countries that have a lot of weapons/defense spending tend to be very eager to use them . 
  nazi germany , soviet union , usa , ... of course , if everyone else is increasing armament , it makes sense to increase armament yourself , but if you take the first step , you 're responsible for the fact that many of your neighbours will want to increase their defense spending too . 
  that just results in an endless armament cycle that 's bad for everyone . 
  i 'd be opposed . 
  the military industry gets more than enough funding as it is . 
  another currency fact : ` dollar ' comes ( via dutch ) from german ` taler ' , which in turn comes from ` thaler ' , from ` joachimsthaler ' , after the mining town st. joachimsthal in the ore mountains ( now j\u00e1chymov ( czech republic ) ) . 
   also i 've heard foreigners have n't heard of the concept of dividing all foods as either sweet or salty . 
  they usually grasp it for junk food ( chips vs icecream ) , but not for all foods . 
  everything from pizza , curry , porkchop to potatoes is `` something salty '' . 
  what 's the difference to ` sweet ' / ` savoury ' ? 
  ( e.g. 
  is it really about containing salt ? 
  [ moskvich ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:moskvich_pinar_cuba_4625.jpg ) , maybe ? 
  it 's a bit different in my opinion though . 
  nazism is an inherently inhumane and uncivilised ideology . 
  communism is n't really a bad thing at all ( if it works/would work ) . 
  it is n't fair on marx and engels to describe the soviet union as even remotely communist , or ban symbols of communism in their original meaning of the word . 
  banning symbols of stalinism would n't be objectionable . 
  although it seems if it does n't show pro-russians in a bad light , it does n't get upvoted as much . 
  and de facto ? 
  germany : theoretically no , unless they have probable cause . 
  however , this ` probable cause ' includes simply being in places that are `` known from experience '' to be connected with criminality or prostitution . 
  but : they basically always ( the law is very loosely formulated ) have the right to force you to produce valid id or be taken to the station to confirm your identity if you can not produce said id , but this is n't grounds for search ( although this may sometimes be abused by police ) . 
  often also sounds like turkish to my ears . 
  btw , my favourite hungarian song : [ omega - gy\u00f6ngyhaj\u00fa l\u00e1ny ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgt-rtdkmcm&amp;feature=kp ), 
  well , [ itar-tass says that witnesses reported it ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/world/728011 ) , but if it were true i 'm pretty sure video would have surfaced by now . 
  dat german sense of humour . 
  oh boy , more * slamming * !, 
  you could aim to sell some of that sweet , sweet green energy to the eu . 
  there 's also ` affenschwanz ' ( monkey 's tail ) . 
  is it me you 're looking for ? 
  cute , 
  well if you want to get technical , they are also mostly at the seaside , which essentially halves local population density   the excuse does n't hold when you then consider that germany is phasing out nuclear power and the uk is embarking on a programme of nuclear expansion . 
  yep :(, 
   i can not understand that anyone knowing about the details of chernobyl , fukushima , three mile island etc. 
  disasters can still support nuclear power . 
  ** dat availability heuristic fallacy **  tl ; dr nuclear power plants suck i agree that nuclear is n't the best option , but it 's certainly more ecological than fossil fuels . 
  the nuclear phaseout does n't make sense if we 're effectively replacing nuclear with fossil fuels . 
   ca n't replace russian gas i agree . 
   also , how do you explain uk and france - far more populous than sweden ? 
  so that excuse does n't hold . 
  france has less than half the population density of both uk and germany , which are roughly similar , and uk has ~ 18 % nuclear , while germany has ~ 11 % . 
  so the excuse holds . 
   and why closing down nuclear reactors while not having a non greenhouse gases emissions ? 
  i can understand and respect the push for renewables but that is not all that is replacing them is it ? 
  that is not even environmental friendly , coal/gas . 
  again , sweden is a small country , with lots of opportunity for hydro . 
  you also have a low population density so your power grid can manage electric heating , and you do not a big history of gas . 
  i 'm not defending the move away from nuclear , i 'm a big proponent of it myself , especially the newer generation reactor types , but you 're seeing things way too simplistically . 
  please point me to any * big * country that primarily uses electric heating and the electricity is mostly from renewables ( and where hydro is n't an option ) . 
  `` slams '', 
  i 'm astonished no one mentioned zurich, 
  laws only matter if you can enforce them . 
  yup , finland is kind of a problem . 
  norway and sweden have lots of hydro , but in finland it 's dark and there are n't that many mountains for doing hydro . 
  i am german . 
  can confirm . 
  heat recovery certainly makes a lot of sense . 
  district heating is common in some places in germany ( fernw\u00e4rme ) , but it makes up only about 1/8 of the total . 
  it 's more common in eastern germany where it was built during soviet times to supply most cities , there it makes up about 1/3 . 
  the eu as a whole is actually pushing for http://www.solar-district-heating.eu/, 
  that 's infeasible ( at least for the next 20-30 years ) . 
  electricity usage makes up a relatively small fraction of total energy consumption . 
  in part , yeah , but that requires electricity too ( although not nearly as much as direct electrical heating ) . 
  semi-related question : how probable is a unification between moldova and romania in the near future ? 
  my parents do , too . 
  it really makes a lot of sense nearly everywhere in europe . 
  the gas stove is the least of the problems . 
  for example in germany , most stoves are electrical , however , 50 % of home heating is done with gas , and more than ~ ~ 90 % ~ ~ 75 % with fossil fuels in total ( the 90 % would be including district heating , which is usually from fossil fuels ) . 
  you ca n't just replace that with electric heating , you use about 75 % of the energy consumption of a household for heating . 
  replacing all that with electric heating would require a much larger electricity production and much larger grid capacity . 
  most of the gas imports are n't being used for gas power plants , but rather for heating . 
  the only replacement for that with renewables would be solar thermal district heating . 
  do n't insult our hat !, 
  seriously , this makes me really angry . 
  first of all , the difference between germany and poland [ is n't that large ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_in_the_european_energy_sector#natural_gas_deliveries ) . 
  secondly , e.g. 
  finland gets 100 % of its gas from russia . 
  third , even if what you say were true , it 'd still be strange . 
  why should buying in bulk and with a shorter transport distance make it more expensive ? 
  is very best gulag in all of russia !, 
  why you no like ? 
  first of all , major parts of western europe are dependent on russian gas too , e.g. 
  germany , and second , the map shows precisely the inverse of what you stated . 
  it is cheaper in the richer western europe , and more expensive in the poorer east . 
  that is an insanely bad translation at times . 
  textbook third reich . 
  judging from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_in_the_european_energy_sector#natural_gas_deliveries , you 'd think germany should be less concerned about possible gas cuts than e.g. 
  poland . 
  our government is way too tolerant of russian actions .
