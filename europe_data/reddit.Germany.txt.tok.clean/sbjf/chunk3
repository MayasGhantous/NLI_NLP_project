  well , this is n't / r/worldnews , and the post title is literally the first sentence of the article , so that would n't be grounds for removal . 
  at least in germany , far right groups usually steal appearances , signs , insignias etc from far left groups , who are then forced to abandon them , e.g. 
  germany is the most populous country in the eu , so it makes sense to first think about what implications it 'd have there , since it 's harder to find good statistics on the whole of the eu . 
  sure , once all or most electricity comes from renewables , it can make sense to heat directly with electricity , and a bit earlier for heat pumps . 
  but first of all , bear in mind that this would severely increase the needed capacity of the electricity grid . 
  only around 1/8th of our energy consumption ( in countries that do not primarily heat with electricity ) is actual electricity usage , the rest is for heating . 
  so in essence , if you wish to replace all heating by electricity , you first have to a ) completely fill the current energy requirements with renewables , and then b ) at least quadruple that energy production and c ) upgrade the energy grid to cope with the higher load and d ) upgrade it to cope with the huge fluctuations in energy production . 
  what makes a lot more sense than converting e.g. 
  solar energy with solar cells into electricity and then back into heat , is to use solar heating collectors to heat water which can then be used in fresh water warming and radiators . 
  my parents have one of those , for example . 
  during the summer and much of spring and autumn , the water heater basically stays off most of the time . 
  and in fact , the eu is pushing for solar thermal district heating . 
  and as long as it does n't environmentally make a lot of sense to heat with electricity , you can still use e.g. 
  renewable wood chip heating . 
  that is anecdotal evidence . 
  also have a look at germany : http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xt5hz3w_bjm/umsl0_thzji/aaaaaaaadhm/w6nrhj32zo8/s1600/heizung+erdgas+erdo%cc%88l+strom.png . 
  the asterisk on ` strom ' ( electricity ) says that this includes heat pumps . 
  6.1 % of heating is done via electricity in germany . 
  no , it is n't . 
  only in very special cases . 
  heating is usually done via oil , gas , wood pellets , or coal ( usually district heating for coal ) . 
  with good reason , it 's incredibly inefficient to heat with electricity when most of it comes from fossil fuels . 
  can be , but is n't . 
  gas is used mainly for heating . 
  electricity is n't . 
  but the troops are n't in the military base , and while crimea has some independence , it 's still the territory of a foreign country . 
  this might be trolling , but that 's actually what the us is obligated to do . 
   russia , along with the us , uk and france , pledged to uphold the territorial integrity of ukraine in a memorandum signed in 1994 . 
  did i understand that correctly ? 
  so basically , it 's the same as if china parked some warships off the coast of the us and landed some armoured vehicles on us soil to ensure the safety of their fleet ? 
  also apcs . 
  not an act of aggression , but an act of war . 
   russia , along with the us , uk and france , pledged to uphold the territorial integrity of ukraine in a memorandum signed in 1994 . 
  interesting . 
  i 've actually seen more american military personnel than german , usually on the autobahn near us bases . 
  german here . 
  i very rarely see military , only in the immediate vicinity of military bases , and then it 's usually just soldiers on a train who are going home or returning from home . 
  i 've never once seen a german tank , military truck , or airplane in person ( except for museums etc ) .

  as jeremy clarkson would say , [ power !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygbp7mtt3ac ), 
  yeah , they are nowhere near socialist . 
  i for one find beds in the american hotels i 've been to to be bad . 
  the matresses are way too soft for my liking , sinking in so much is uncomfortable and also not very healthy for your back . 
  * tips fedora *, 
  for adults sure , but since it 's still young , i thought maybe it could still learn those things . 
  could n't they just ship it back to other giraffes in africa , if they want to keep their local population free of in-breeding ? 
  or alternatively sterilize it ? 
  the german one is [ din 1451 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/din_1451 ) in case anyone is interested . 
  \\ #justgirlythings, 
  `` it 's okay , i 'm not as bad as hitler '' . 
   janukovits is that how you spell janukowytsch in danish ? 
  looks cool . 
  just checked his comment history , a bunch in the whiterights subreddit too , no wonder ... 
  you ca n't classify what different generations and therefore different people say as ` hypocrisy ' . 
  the world must be a simple place with such fixed enemy stereotypes as `` it 's all the evil west '' . 
  also , i think it might interest you that in my experience there is a much larger nude bathing scene in germany ( especially the east , with polish people near the border complaining of nude germans on the beach ) and england than in conservative poland . 
  but it 's definitely interesting to read that being gay was never outlawed in poland . 
  being taller than 1.85 m is a height deviation . 
  let 's remove some of their rights , too ? 
  * every * human trait exists on a continuous scale . 
  precisely , every adult should be able to marry any other consenting adult they wish . 
  currently there * is * preferential treatment . 
  in favour of straight people . 
  how is giving someone a right that other people already have ` preferential treatment ' ? 
   we 've long been treating them like everyone else . 
   but they 're demanding more , like gay marriage yeah , looks like they are n't treated equally . 
  yep , we want to turn everyone gay . 
  what you just concluded makes no logical sense whatsoever . 
  i very rarely see non-german euro coins in eastern germany . 
  if he sent scanned documents , and there 's a name on it , you could just try to find contact details and ask the person over the phone directly . 
  if you look at the names , it 's obvious . 
  they 're bots . 
  best i could think of :  there once were some houses in ireland , with repairs the government had planned , then the bank crisis came , but , oh , what a shame , now it 's just abandoned , run-down land, 
  fishing only the largest fish is not a good idea at all , since it 's essentially selecting for smaller fish from an evolutionary perspective . 
  [ see this video by minutephysics ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9yovuequge ) . 
  the best thing would be to catch * fewer * fish and from a * wider * range of sizes . 
  germany 's population is n't greater than france 's and italy 's combined, 
  even though the export goods are relatively similar , germany exports nearly 50 % more than france and italy combined . 
  [ not really , poland is n't a strong exporter ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tvmkd/treemaps_of_exports_for_european_countries/cecj449 ) . 
  i know that used to be the case , but it has more subscribers than / r/europe now , so i do n't think linking it here constitutes as being linked in a ` major ' subreddit . 
  i see an / r/polandball comic in the making . 
  yeah , bigger cities like munich definitely have overpriced housing , and prices in berlin are also starting to rise ( although still extremely good prices compared to most other big cities ) , but i do n't think there 's a general housing bubble , like you have in the uk . 
  i 'd attribute that to the fact that it is n't common to buy and sell houses for profit here , because there is a lot of renting as well ( which is a very good thing , in my opinion ) . 
  chemnitz , germany : [ one ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/92682792@n00/8247589823/lightbox/ ) , [ two ] ( http://www.global-christmas.com/images/media/raw/4dbe5da0f5e7a4a28a1ae405f41daf5f.jpeg ) , [ three ] ( http://www.global-christmas.com/images/media/raw/50a2a9b795979ea9d4121571ee2cc1a0.jpeg ) , [ four ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/30103930.jpg ) , [ five ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/16420742.jpg ) , [ six ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/82851989.jpg ) [ and a video of imagees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2asmbskojto ) !, 
  so where 's the housing price bubble in germany or switzerland ?

  when you try to open it again , the economist shoves a paywall in your face . 
  magick-nl owns peasants ? 
  is that legal ? 
  i agree . 
  it 's also a lot more consistent that way , because units also go after the number . 
  a distance is n't ` km 10 ' , but rather '10 km ' . 
  the sentence , or the individual words ? 
  for a sentence , it wo n't be possible to do colours based on that sentence , because they may have different roots . 
  yep , i 'll do that for rev. 
  i was n't prepared for maltesian redditors : /, 
  yep , you 're right . 
   it would be easier ( i thought about it as well ) but i do n't have the patience to do it as the layers are done to overlap in different ways to get the end result .
