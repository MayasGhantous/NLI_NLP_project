  mh , yeah , might be a bit hard to put into practice . 
  do you know if with svg/inkscape it 's possible to create some sort of a meta-object that contains all parts instead ? 
  you could also put it in the [ wiki ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/wiki/index ) over in our new subreddit , if you do n't mind other people using it as well . 
  ( i also slightly modified it , e.g. 
  removed karelian , added sorbian , ... ) . 
  it would probably also be a good idea for the templates to use masking of * only one * coloured object per country , instead of doing islands/exclaves/etc separately . 
  this would avoid forgotten parts and make it easier to write scripts to generate maps . 
  but i do n't often use svg/inkscape , so i do n't know how easily that can be done . 
   anyway , this is actually a very good and interesting map . 
  sorry if i cam out too critical  all of this is very constructive , so i do n't mind a bit . 
  thanks again !, 
  thank you for these points : multiple colours : i think i have to agree . 
  although it was worth the experiment , i wanted to have the map look less flat , but in the end it 's just confusing unless the colours are correlated with something ( i hinted at this for lithuania and latvia , they 're a bit more yellow to indicate their word for `` honey '' came via proto-baltic ) . 
  yeah , i essentially just [ gave up ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/caucasus-ethnic_en.svg/984px-caucasus-ethnic_en.svg.png ) , and just kinda went `` fuck it '' and made everything pink , since i do n't know very much about the situation there and etymology resources are scarce , and most languages around there seem to be turkic . 
  damn . 
  ( the template could also use fixing in this regard , though ) 3 . 
  damn . 
  ( i have an excuse , i 'm partially colourblind ! ), 
  white is just supposed to be everything that is n't indicated on the legend . 
  ( basque and maltese is white , too ) 5 . 
  yeah , i actually thought about this , but for some reason decided readability would be better this way . 
  your maps clearly show how to do it better .

  ah , sorry , i seem to have abbreviated quite a bit : pie : proto-indo-european language pg : proto-germanic language l : latin language pb : proto-baltic language ps : proto-slavic language pfu : proto-finno-ugric language pt : proto-turkic language edit : btw , the '' \\* '' in front of many of these roots indicates that it was reconstructed , i.e. 
  there is no written record of it . 
  please feel free to point out any mistakes/ideas for improvement !, 
  this is the first time i 've tried to make such a map . 
  i thought ` honey ' might be a good idea , since it 's something staple that has been around for so long and in many cultures . 
  so with a few exceptions ( e.g. 
  finland suddenly turned germanic ) , it should be a good representation of the language family itself .

  kalmykia is wrong ) [ ^ thanks ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qp2oe/honey_in_various_european_languages_ocxpost/cdf24i3 ) * the little yellow patch at the north romania/ukraine should be green/ukrainian .

  * irish gaelic should cover more of the island ( e.g. 
  dotted ) [ ^ thanks ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1qp2zk/honey_in_various_european_languages_oc14861200/cdf16xl ) * white parts of turkey are there primarily to indicate the indigenous kurdish language , not sure about demographics though . 
  [ ^ thanks ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1qp2zk/honey_in_various_european_languages_oc14861200/cdf20uh ) * in finnish , `` mesi '' is nearly synonymous with `` hunaja '' , so there 's still a finno-ugric version of honey .

  both ultimately related to the slavic ` smetana ' iirc . 
  most words come from pie , one way or another . 
  i know ` dutt ' as a hairstyle . 
  east or west ? 
  i think it might have been more common in the west . 
  note : i went to school in the 90s and i never heard/sang/used it . 
  besides the fact that electricity is a lot more expensive everywhere in western europe , charging is not 100 % efficient as you erroneously assume , more like 80 % . 
  add to that the fact that the car itself is extremely expensive , it makes little economical sense to buy a tesla currently . 
  a diesel consumes 5l/100km under similarly ideal conditions , which comes to 7,50 $ / 100km , so about 0.02 $ / km more than the tesla . 
  you 'd have to drive close to 3 million km just to break even vs a brand new diesel . 
  because bikes ( especially those made out of aluminium ) take a lot of energy to produce . 
  i was thinking more along the lines of `` doing your share '' in terms of being environmentally friendly . 
  although it 's only really ` doing your share ' if you needed a bike and did n't have one before . 
  still , when dutch people speak , i do n't understand a thing ( except for a few words here and there ) . 
  but yeah , the transition between a dialect and a language is pretty damn blurry . 
  you could probably also see swiss german as its own language . 
  after all , most north germans would n't understand a thing when it 's spoken , and if they actually wrote how it 's pronounced , it 'd look quite distinct from standard german . 
  off-topic , but i am constantly amazed at the written similarity of dutch and german . 
  i can basically read every single word ( and grew up nowhere near northern germany ) . 
  but spoken it is an entirely different matter : /, 
  i think a lot of native english speakers actually say similar things . 
  [  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/alemania_imperial.png ), 
  we 're dealing in hypotheticals here , but i doubt that germany would have been defeated easily had the ussr dropped out in 1942 or so . 
  the partisan activity was very minor compared to battlefield losses . 
  the western front had extremely few troops compared to the east , and an invasion of the scale of d-day would have failed miserably . 
  but even if the west still won , the war would have dragged on for a hell of a lot longer , at least 8-10 years in my opinion . 
  but yeah , the ussr obviously saw it as a chance to bring stalinism under the guise of socialism to europe ( read : force ... on ) . 
  i 've been to gdansk , except for the city centre , it looked very run down . 
  there was also no motorway to gdansk from germany . 
  the state of the roads was also rather abysmal in general . 
  however i have little to compare either eastern germany or poland to , since i was born after reunification , but it must have been pretty bad in poland . 
  are you seriously implying it 'd have been better in the long run had germany won ww2 ... ? 
  that 'll only very faintly taste of lemon though . 
  or you have way superior lemons . 
  the industry of the frg also got a buttload of free ( albeit many somewhat antiquated ) factories . 
  true , but still the lesser of two evils . 
  does n't make it right , though . 
   ( who was jewish ) was that really necessary ? 
  please do n't generalise like that , 
  is n't it the legal responsibility of the parents to send their kids to school ? 
  afaik in germany not sending your kids to school would lead to you losing custody of your children . 
  which i think is a good thing . 
  i 've never actually seen any roma/gypsies ( / whatever the correct term is ) in my life . 
  i always wonder where people in germany that seem to have a strong opinion about them see them . 
  17/20 , no swedish knowledge , not a metalhead , occasional ikea-goer . 
  however , many of those metal bands have pretty west-germanic namens . 
  \\* beneath everyone 's pigs . 
  i 'm glad no one said sternburg , because it has the image of being really bad due to its price , but in my opinion , it 's actually quite good . 
  it 's just that every batch seems to taste a little different :d, 
  yes , let 's just generalise a whole group of people based on what a small subgroup does . 
  sounds familiar ... oh wait . 
  it 's the * empire * way . 
  what does the green marker in berlin signify ? 
  i think a dynamic limit would be best , something along the lines of `` all parties that have more than 5 % of the two biggest parties combined get seats '' . 
  but at least there 'd have been a strong opposition . 
  if it comes to a grand coalition , the spd will morph into a small cdu once again and be destroyed in the next elections . 
  this makes it sound like the end results are n't proportionate to the party vote . 
  however , they are . 
  if you have more direct candidates than your party vote would allow , you retain your seats ( '' \u00dcberhang '' mandates ) and the other parties gain so-called `` ausgleichs '' mandates , so it balances out in the end . 
  so in effect , local candidates that win in a fptp style are guaranteed their place , but the total composition is still according to the party votes .
