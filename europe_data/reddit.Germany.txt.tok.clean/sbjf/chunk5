  i 'd be interested in how r-r-g would work out . 
  though i guess it would be somewhat of an experiment with uncertain success . 
  the only place i 've ever seen a kaiser 's in my life is in berlin . 
  no idea where else they are , predominantly in the west maybe ? 
  if you have a fluctuating energy source like wind , you need efficient and effective methods of storing energy . 
  of which there are currently none . 
  i usually prefer the migros-brand products to the coop ones , but migros has fewer external brands , it can sometimes be a hassle . 
  i prefer edeka ( also rewe and kaufland ), 
  for anyone wondering , essentially none of what barsoap said is actually true . 
  edit : ` ss ' can be used for \u00df , when this is n't available . 
  additionally , swiss german replaced the \u00df entirely . 
  so it 's like an american saying `` it 's ` traveling ' , not ` travelling ' , you dimwit '' . 
  and there are * many * compound words that drop some letters or add some in between . 
  too meme-y for my taste . 
  your flag is catalunya , correct ? 
  at least they do n't [ commit murders every other year ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/todesopfer_rechtsextremer_gewalt_in_deutschland#polizeiliche_kriminalstatistik ) . 
  ` despise ' is too strong a word for this , but ever since being forced to learn french in school , i have had a certain disdain for the language . 
  that 's a pretty cool map , you might want to submit it to / r/mapporn :d while it does show that beer is cheaper in restaurants than in germany , but it does n't really tell me the supermarket price . 
  to compare , budweiser ( budvar ) is about $ 0.75 ( 0.5 l ) here , and cheap local beers that are still tasty can be had for about $ 0.50 per bottle ( 0.5 l ) , while the cheapest beers are about $ 0.30 per bottle . 
  most beers are between $ 0.50 and $ 0.80 per bottle . 
  yeah , in no other country i 've been to has beer been as cheap . 
  dont forget [ germania with the cannabis sword ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/image_germania_%28painting%29.jpg ) . 
  i 'd have thought you make more jokes about us sauschwaben . 
  i had a huge a-ha moment about 2 minutes after seeing [ the logo ] ( http://www.huntlogo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/carrefour-logo.jpg ) for the first time a while back while staying in normandy ( preparing for an allied invasion by digging sandcastles , of course ) . 
  zurich , too . 
  edit : what 's not classy about zurich ? 
  the equator and the country of russia seem to make people angry . 
  poverty can only be caused by people leaving if there was poverty and inequality beforehand . 
  that just reinforces my statement even more . 
  so assuming the scottish want independence but do n't get it , it 'd be fair for france to shell london ? 
  nothing is ever 100 % certain . 
  deformed iberia : ` kill me now ', 
  i did n't say that . 
  ( edit : and i actually agree with her ) but it makes it less newsworthy . 
  why is this crap from some far-right lunatic upvoted ? 
  she 'd say anything to get more voters into her base . 
  yes ... ` peeling ' the ` potato ' ... 
  [ we need to talk about latvia ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m720gvjfno1rvwttvo1_500.gif ), 
  [ i quite enjoy this winner from 1965 . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5aeesmkpwq ), 
  could be due to that , but the inherent reason is probably strongly polarised opinions on germany ( which in turn may be due to generational divides ) btw : since when is it cold in angola ? 
  make your mind up , poland : * most trustworthy : germany * least trustworthy : germany, 
  [ what ? 
  ] ( http://www.abb.com/industries/ap/db0003db004333/148bff3c00705c5ac125774900517d9d.aspx ) next time , read your own source . 
  there 's even mention of the 6.4 gw link there . 
  no , with hvdc you can very effectively transport electric energy . 
  in china there 's a 2000km 6.4 gw link . 
  they all have ray bans though . 
  [ i guess you 're right ] ( http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/news/local/2012/02/20/19403206.html ), 
  and that 's how glaciers form . 
  penguins in canada ? 
  now i 'm hungry :(, 
  i 'm from there too and have never heard that term for orange . 
  maybe only the mountain folk use it :d, 
  i think it does . 
  just because you find something offensive is no grounds for banning it . 
  giving a logical reason for banning it does . 
  that of course does not preclude you from having a logical reason for finding it offensive , but the only thing that should be grounds for banning is reason . 
  what about the relatively high murder rate compared to the eu average ? 
  just because you find it offensive is no reason to ban it . 
  what if i find milk to be offensive ? 
  is that grounds for banning ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  mind you , i agree that it should be forbidden , or do i also have the right to make a buttload of noise multiple times a day and spread propaganda ? 
  i think not , and if i did , i would most definitely want that right removed for the sake of my own peace and quiet from others . 
  edit : [ relevant as to why ` offended ' is a bad choice of words ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b48_1305790944 ), 
  i should learn to read more thoroughly , you 're right of course . 
  nevertheless the banning of the kpd had some serious effects on its success , and it still is the same state ( essentially ) that banned it . 
  no , the communist party ( kpd ) was banned too , as your source correctly states . 
  edit : see dag-nabbit 's reply , but it no longer is , even though it was not resurrected after the banning . 
  centered crosses do n't count !, 
  england also ca n't into nordic . 
  ostfriesland seems to be doing just fine . 
  so it must still be your fault !, 
  well , those places do n't sound too good , but we need some form of power source to supply the base load until we can find an efficient and cheap way to store energy or until nuclear fusion is viable . 
  while those places do not sound good at all , they are not really endangering the future of our planet . 
  it would probably be best to put the endlagerst\u00e4tten in more remote areas of our planet . 
  fair enough , i have cash reserves instead . 
  salt mines are usually a good place to store atomic waste , * because * they are dry . 
  if they were n't , there would n't be any salt there . 
  it sounds a bit like you 're demonizing nuclear power , thats probably why you were downvoted . 
  however , i had never heard of any problems regarding those endlagerst\u00e4tten . 
  ( i am a supporter of nuclear power ), 
  care to elaborate ? 
  anyway , i would wish for the economy of piigs to become healthy and strong . 
  equally distributed ? 
  i hope you mean equally per capita ? 
  i 'm ( kind of ) glad there are not that many french people on here for that very reason , they tend to do this all the time , and i get easily annoyed by mistakes . 
  you have * emergency reserves * ? 
  do you expect some major crisis soon ? 
  not to mention / r/spacedicks . 
  well , augustus_trollus_iii was aiming for a double entendre , so both would be correct i 'd say , though your version would fit both meanings better . 
  interesting information though , i did not know that , i just assumed it came from * nati * onalsozialist . 
  here is more information ( in german ) , if anyone 's interested : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi#begriffsgeschichte, 
  i had * turkey * . 
  this is / r/europe after all . 
  ze plan is working . 
  chrome definitely has memory in the omnibox . 
  i also just need 2-3 chars for the right site to pop up , e.g. 
  r -  reddit , f -  facebook , m -  gmail , map -  gmaps etc edit : though i think it just orders by frequency of visit and not frequency of selecting a certain entry when going to a site,
