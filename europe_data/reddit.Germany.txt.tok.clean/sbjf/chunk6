  venison with lead . 
  one explanation ? 
  as a german chrome user , i 'm amazed so many people still use ff . 
  i switched around ff 3.0 because it was just getting really slow and the tab location just made a lot more sense on chrome . 
  [ like so ? 
  the demand for hosemasks is high , and the rest has to go somwhere . 
  so lasagna it is . 
  and nowhere i 've actually read how much horse there 's inside these contaminated products . 
  everywhere it just says they 've isolated horse dna , so i guess it could be very very little horse meat that is actually in there . 
  do n't give them any ideas . . 
  3/10 on the first page here . 
  i 'm pretty sure derwisch was being sarcastic . 
  i do n't think anyone finds italian pleasant to listen to . 
  everyone yells at you all the time . 
  ... what ? 
  how about the government just takes 100 % of your income instead of 25 % ? 
  it 's $ 2.5 bln in taxes , not 10 . 
  but the sorbs are n't poles , as far as i know , they 're sorbs . 
  central germany agrees . 
  though children will occasionally be kissed by relatives , especially grandmothers .

  i really do n't know anything about denmark except for the olsen-banden movies . 
  also , you 're a hat !, 
  it 's like with evolution , we share a common ancestor , i.e. 
  just because it 's a top google result does n't mean it has any factual merit . 
  i had a look and those are surveys from owners ' perception of reliability . 
  it does n't even take into account age of the car and is therefore in no way a reliable study . 
  [ here ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.adac.de/infotestrat/unfall-schaeden-und-panne/pannenstatistik/default.aspx&amp;usg=alkjrhiy2e0tkiaotsw_ltymaf__wf_f-w ) you get actual number of breakdowns per number of cars registered for a given age of a car for cases in 2014 . 
  i have the feeling vw is n't alone on cheating in these tests , at least i do n't think they 're at such a technological disadvantage that would force them to install this kind of malicious software . 
  i wonder if other manufacturers will be hit with similar lawsuits ? 
  german cars * are * exceptionally well made and have fewer breakdowns than cars from most other countries ( there are adac studies to back this up ) , but they also have exorbitant parts costs when something does go wrong , so in the end it is much more cost effective to go for japanese cars . 
  it has a different etymology though . 
   from middle english or , oor , blend of old english \u014dra ( `` ore , unwrought metal '' ) and \u0101r ( `` brass , copper , bronze '' ) , the first a derivate of ear ( `` earth '' ) , the second from proto-germanic * aiz ( compare old norse eir ( `` brass , copper '' ) , german ehern ( `` of metal , of iron '' ) , gothic ( aiz , `` ore '' ) ) , from proto-indo-european * \u00e1yos , h \u2082 \u00e9yos . 
  confer latin aes ( `` bronze , copper '' ) , avestan ayah , sanskrit \u0905\u092f\u0938\u094d ( \u00e1yas , `` copper , iron '' ) . 
  are people really too stupid to realise this is someone trolling ? 
  democracy at the eu level would mean less democracy at the national level , i.e. 
  eu interfering with national politics , which is something you and many people seem to be against . 
  you ca n't have your cake and eat it , too . 
  what a great human bean . 
  `` but professor , i anwered all the questions from the test , i just did n't write them down . '', 
  they are bitching exactly because you * can * feel it . 
  what you feel is the temperature of your body . 
  if it feels like it 's so cold you 're about to die , then you * are * about to die . 
  it 's just that humid air has a higher heat capacity , so it can cool/heat your body more . 
  air that 's above freezing point can contain humidity , but for heat capacity what counts is absolute humidity , which is still very low for low temperatures above zero . 
  the biggest influence for low temperatures is wind speed , hence the `` wind chill '' name that 's often used . 
  for high temperatures humidity matters a lot more , because sweating is no longer as efficient , and hotter air can carry a lot more moisture , increasing its heat capacity dramatically . 
  that 's not how thermal conduction works ... 
  * seized , lel, 
  now that 's just wishful thinking . 
  that 's a nice word you learned , but you should also learn not just to spell it , but also when to use it . 
   general motors, 
  the boycott of jewish businesses came before the holocaust ... 
  fire brigades are a luxury you do not deserve !, 
  do n't you lazy greeks get that ? 
  you need complete capitalism , privatise everything . 
  that 'll improve things . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ not, 
  * south africa * kenya * uganda * nigeria * cameroon * burma * zimbabwe * pakistan * ... 
  that 's really a smooth transition though , e.g. 
  in german * fenster * ( window ) comes from latin * fenestra * , but has been used for more than a thousand years . 
  an example of a somewhat younger loanword would for example be * portemonnaie * ( wallet , 19th century ) , which can now also be spelt * portmonee * . 
  then there are more recent adoptions . 
  what 's the point at which you consider something to no longer be a foreign word ? 
  * knapp * actually means ` scarce ' or ` barely ' in germany , interesting . 
  total anarchy or bust !, 
  i 'm pretty sure there are quite a few wind farms in southern germany which is marked as ` not suitable ' though . 
  yep : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/windkraftanlagen_in_deutschland.png, 
  which has absolutely nothing to do with your argument . 
  was that jab at nasa really necessary ? 
  that requires quite a lot of space and darkness though . 
  just get some sort of lens ( binoculars , camera lens , magnifying glass ) and project it onto some surface . 
  top right is censored really badly . 
  probably either the author or the recipient of the card . 
  you can read the name , phone number , and what probably means something along the lines of `` white house travel office '', 
  burning down buildings is `` debate '' ? 
  the pirate party was n't invited either back when they were polling over 10 % . 
  why ? 
  let 's hope he has that entrepreneurial spirit and does n't geht scammed in the process . 
  i suspect he wo n't manage his cash correctly , just like most lottery players : /, 
  while we 're at it , let 's eat from the body , too . 
  the consequences will never be the same . 
   i am 100 % certain the scandal is not going to stop at vw . 
  and just a few days ago , i was downvoted for tentatively proposing the same thing . 
  iirc it 's the second highest in the eu by ppp . 
  til : the only famous person whose opinion i respect that was for leave . 
  wait , why are you writing in german ? 
  meh , so was the us for me , do n't judge a book by its cover . 
  this is at least incomplete for germany , it 's missing e.g. 
  the [ a72 between chemnitz and leipzig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesautobahn_72#/media/file:map_d_a72.svg ), 
  sure ? 
  i only know a little french but it seems more correct the way it is . 
  i contest that !, 
  did you manage to change it back ? 
  however , it still says i do n't have permission to access the document . 
  edit : ah , appears in my gdocs list , though . 
  many thanks !, 
  thanks  it sent an email to request authorisation . 
  how about now ?
