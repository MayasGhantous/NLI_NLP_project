  this [ rand study ] ( https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/rr1253.html ) estimates that russia could close the suwalki gap and overrun the baltic states in less than 60 hours ( though nato has reinforced them since then , this would still be the case ) . 
  current nato forces in the baltics and poland can not put up a credible defense and moving in significant reinforcements could take quite a while due insufficient infrastructure and preparation and a possible lack of political will among some members . 
  meanwhile russia has repeatedly demonstrated its capability to mobilise tens of thousands of troops in short order with snap exercises . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/are-the-baltic-states-really-indefensible ) describes how the russians have increased their capability to launch large-scale military operations , which is now reaching its peak , over the last few years . 
  nato would not be able to hold the baltic states , so they would have to launch a costly offensive on an entrenched enemy to retake them . 
  they would probably win that war eventually , especially once reinforcements from the us arrive and an air campaign is possibly extended beyond the baltic theater and over russia itself . 
  this is where the tactical nuclear weapon option comes in for russia . 
  with germany it 's two armoured divisions , and deploying is a different question as we even ran into trouble supplying one batallion in lithuania . 
  people here often dismiss a russian threat to the baltics and overestimate nato 's capabiltiy to defend them . 
  they certainly did n't add 25 divisions to the military . 
  perhaps he 's talking about a restructuring of existing units . 
  it would begin with tactical nuclear weapons . 
  [ saceur general scaparrotti ] ( http://docs.house.gov/meetings/as/as00/20170328/105780/hhrg-115-as00-wstate-scaparrottic-20170328.pdf ) ( page 6 ) points out a russian doctrine to `` escalate its way out of a failing conflict '' using these weapons . 
  so in a baltic war scenario , russia could use tactical nuclear weapons on nato assembly areas in poland , hoping this would make nato back down . 
  it could go the other way though , with nato responding with tactical nuclear weapons . 
  at that point a strategic exchange is not far off . 
  unless it ends up in a nuclear exchange , you 're right . 
  you can not say that with absolute certainty . 
  putin certainly does not want a war protracted with nato . 
  i do n't even think the scenario outlined in this article would lead to war , as both sides would try to de-escalate quickly . 
  even if the us decide to strike the syrian regime , which is a distinct possibility right now , russian forces there would probably not respond . 
  that does n't mean there ca n't be a miscalculation on putin 's part . 
  the only thing i could see nato and russia go to war over is the baltics . 
  russia 's capability to launch large military operations is slowly [ peaking ] ( http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/is-russia-getting-ready-to-invade-ukraine-again ) and will only deteriorate in the future . 
  due to modernization , ( re - ) formation of spearhead units such as the 1st guards tank army , constant exercises and a build-up of military infrastructure they are in a state of readiness they have never been in since the cold war . 
  what if putin decides to take a gamble for the baltics , possibly at a time when many us assets are tied down in theaters such as north korea ? 
  the russian armed forces could close the suwalki gap and overwhelm the baltic states in a [ relatively short amount of time ] ( https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/rr1253.html ) , as nato forces there and in poland are not really enough to put up a credible defense . 
  putin might assume that nato would ultimately back down in such a situation , not deciding to launch a costly campaign to retake the territory . 
  a good time to launch such an offensive would be the upcoming [ zapad-2017 ] ( http://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-100k-russian-troops-belarus-zapad-drill-baltic-nato-allies-phillip-breedlove/ ) exercise in september , which will involve up to 200.000 troops in belarus and western russia . 
  although these could also be directed towards further operations in ukraine , not risking a confrontation with nato . 
  this is all very unlikely , but it is not completely impossible that putin , partly due to facing increasing domestic issues , would take this risk . 
  maybe not in the sense of ww2 , but a confrontation between nato and russia will basically amount to a world war .

  ( edit : just found an english article : http://belsat.eu/en/news/lukashenka-armed-groups-trained-in-ukraine-poland-lithuania-up-to-provocations-in-belarus/ ) _______________________________________________________ shitty google translation : ** lukashenko said that belarus has arrested dozens of militants with weapons ** alexander lukashenko today while interacting with staff in mogilev `` kronospan '' company announced the arrest of dozens of armed men , who allegedly prepared provocation . 
  according to the state news agency belta , `` answering the question of one of the workers about the causes of the recent surge in the so-called fifth column and the various opposition organizations '' , lukashenko said : `` as demonstrated by the reality , they did not sleep ( the individual ) , they are quietly preparing for the case , chose the moment ... 
  they not only did not sleep . 
  we have already detained several dozen ( not those in the buses , anarchists with masks ) , which trenavalisya in camps with weapons . 
  by the way , one of the camps in the area was the bobruisk and osipovich . 
  the rest of the camp - in ukraine , in my opinion , ( i will not say , but somewhere in there ) in lithuania and poland , - said alexander lukashenko . 
  - the money went through poland and lithuania to us . 
  we are literally in those hours was detained a few dozen militants who were preparing a provocation with a weapon . '', 
  lukashenko said that more extensive information about this fact will be provided after the public . 
  he also talked about how law enforcement agencies managed to learn about the existence of such plans . 
  `` thank you , that is , the belarusians and the belarusian true that , being abroad in the eu , warned us . 
  a woman came to the embassy and warned officially wrote a letter to : preparing a provocation . 
  and we began to understand . 
  and indeed reached a very interesting things '' , - said alexander lukashenko . 
  svaboda is not yet possible to specify voiced by alexander lukashenko , the information in the kgb and the interior ministry of belarus - the press secretaries of these structures do not take off the headphones . 
  the investigation committee promised to clarify the information later . 
  it was n't that much of a priority during the cold war . 
  west germany had the largest army in western europe then . 
  edit : of course it was a big issue at the beginning of rearmament . 
  i imagine it was n't that much of concern anymore by the 80s though . 
  ah , i just got triggered without looking at the context , thanks for clearing that up !, 
   thats what i usually see civilians say that never been to the army , or been to one of the microscopic pseudo-armies like belgian military i do n't think the size or combat strength of a country 's military necessarily translates to the individual training and abilities of its soldiers . 
  belgium 's soldiers are likely trained to the same standard as other western military personnel ( infantry like the parachute and commando units certainly are ) so it 's unfair to compare them to civilians . 
  germany is smaller than i expected . 
  it feels so constrained suddenly . 
  i 'm thinking about space ... more space ... 
  if we wanted to nullify the treaty in case we need to expand the military beyond that , we could easily do so . 
  no problem , we still have poland . 
  they actually have an army . 
  third time we ally , ja ? 
  russia is not going to let belarus orient toward the west . 
  nato certainly would react , but i can see some individual member states not going along with it . 
  and i think the first thing they 'd do is deploy troops to clear any insurgency . 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland#/media/file:finnish_areas_ceded_in_1944.png ) , both after the winter war and after ww2 . 
  \u00c5land is demilitarised . 
  i once read a hypothetical scenario in which russia tries to pressure finland into permitting a russian base on the islands . 
  they fake terrorist attacks on their oil infrastructure in the baltic sea , claiming they were carried out by a group operating out of the area , to justify it . 
  it was pretty interesting . 
  that seems right . 
  sadly , i do n't even think one can count on the full support of all nato members in case of an attack on one of the eastern members . 
  that would be pretty much an overt attack . 
  let 's take the baltics , since it is somewhat more likely there . 
  what if the attack is less overt ? 
  what if russia uses it 's `` little green men '' approach to stir up trouble ? 
  they would maintain some degree of deniability , no matter how obvious it is they are behind it . 
  other members could use that to justify inaction ( same goes for nato ) . 
  in theory , but i 'm not confident everyone would go along with it , especially if the attack is not conventional . 
  this is less of a risk with finland though , more with the baltic states . 
  finland would be hard to fight and terrible to occupy . 
  baltics would make more sense , but they 're in nato , so it 's too risky . 
  \u00c5land looks pretty juicy though . 
  thanks for going into detail !, 
  it seems pretty unlikely russia will try anything huge then .
