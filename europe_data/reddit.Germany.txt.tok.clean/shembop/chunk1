in this article , ` turkey ' suspects the soldiers seeking asylum have connections to the g\u00fclen movement , and demands the applications be rejected . 
  that 's not how we roll . 
  germany regards every application for asylum as it is , and bases its decision on factors that are important for germany . 
  political wishes of other countries do not come into perspective . 
  edit : also , i still have no idea how your previous comment has to do with my post . 
  interesting assumption , / u/bbmm !, 
  would you care to elaborate ? 
  ( quite honestly , i have n't the faintest idea how you come to this conclusion based on my well-meant comment . ), 
  edit : added your name . 
  please bring a humble desire to integrate and share your vibrant culture with us , the will to learn enough german to feel comfortable around others , and the willingness to contribute to society by gainful employment . 
  for your information , the majority of germans do not engage in your personal religious activities , and we therefore kindly request refraining from displays of extreme behaviour . 
  other than that , thank you to all your parents and grandparents who , through hard work and determination , ( as well as the courage to leave their homeland ) helped germany come out of the financial ruins of the world war ii . 
  much of our present-day fulfilled happiness is thanks to them !, 
  edit : spelling, 
  slovenia , please be nice and rise above . 
  just like trump does not represent all of america , the majority of european turks ( for want of a better term ) do not consider erdogan as their voice and mentality . 
  would you care to provide us with an experience or source and numbers to your statement/observation , or is your comment purely hypothetical ? 
  greetings from the heart of what you wrongly consider overrun by nazism . 
  thankfully , they are in a small minority and under a watchful eye . 
  which is a good thing , no ? 
  * `` i do n't care what hans , george or helga say , i care what hasan , ahmet , mehmet , ayse and fatma say . 
  i care what god says ... '' * it 's getting increasingly difficult to not want to ** slap ** this guy upside the head . 
  ( this is however exactly what he is trying to provoke . ), 
  edit : a virtual ** slap ** . 
  the chili-cheese fries in sligo , ireland !, 
  edit : apparently , there are no children in * child * - cheese fries . 
  attempting to elicit a negative response is the definition of trolling . 
  in the future , please refrain from posting such content in / r/europe . 
  maybe an * `` open display of breasts in supermarkets and regular newsagents '' * is a sign of the freedom of the press we respect . 
  maybe your definition of `` smutty '' is due to you being * `` traumatised by experience . . '' * and you * '' ... come from one of the poorest regions in the eu ... '' * / u/stevenfries . 
  ( see how judging is n't always spot-on ? ), 
  i 'm * ( very ) * proud to be german . 
  come and visit our wonderful country and find out why !, 
  * `` a spokesman denied that she was considering stepping down as party leader . 
  eu 's mother ? 
  i can understand why people would think that . 
  talking * down * to anyone ? 
  even as the most powerful woman in the world , she would n't talk * down * to anyone , not even to those politicians who we normal mortals would otherwise be screaming at . 
  germany 's chancellor deserves a lot more credit than that . 
  careful , your * donald * is showing . 
  ( just kidding , nobody really cares about your six-day old profile consisting of a constant stream of uninformed negativity . ), 
  the uk is n't even acting as if they want a break-up . 
  they 've handed in the divorce papers . 
  the uk family is moving to a more secluded place , yes , but let 's hope that us kids can at least all stay friends and still be able to visit each other at the playground once in a while . 
  merkel 's attitude on the subject of parallel talks has been obvious since shortly after the uk 's decision to leave . 
  just like in any divorce , the couple needs to take it step by step . 
  dividing the furniture , paying alimony and figuring out visiting rights for the kids simply does not happen all together . 
  / u/kevinuxbridge , you posted yesterday : * '' ... we 're supposed to be civilised . 
  so , no matter how many times we humans fail to live up to that , i consider it a kind of fluke , an indication that we 've lost our path so to speak . 
  i hope and even expect us to find it again . 
  '' * i think you 've lost your path in the last 24 hours . 
  edit : whoops !, 
  i take that back !, 
  you 've lost your path a while ago , have n't you ? 
  posting * `` it 's the immigration stupid !, 
  '' * in / r/europeannationalism makes you sound pretty much like a dick to me . 
  '' * given what we know about the history of dutch politics and parliamentary structures , this seems a difficult claim to substantiate . 
  some turks are now aware that they would possibly be in hot water after returning to turkey . 
  effective intelligence at work . 
  * here ? 
  * who woulda thought ? 
  prost !, 
  just kidding !, 
  your question is really good . 
  i honestly do not think we have anything comparable to those examples , but would gladly stand corrected . 
  ( anyone ? ), 
  maybe it 's also a holdover from * not * exclaiming german pride for decades . 
  we 've only recently begun enjoying that feeling in a positive sense , and standing behind it . 
  the world cup in 2006 really skyrocketed that vibe . 
  but , terms like vive la france have been around since * forever * , so it 's difficult to compare . 
  woah there , slovenia ... we do n't say that ( anymore ) in germany . 
  ( but thank you for the sentiment ! ), 
  accurate title . 
  thank you for your extensive and understandable explanation , / u/tepadno . 
  if you ever decide on coming over to germany and pass through d\u00fcsseldorf , allow me to give you a comfortably new experience by showing you around a bit . 
  feel free to expand your horizons , and pm me any time . 
  * holds mirror up * stating `` in majority of cases ... '' and generalising how we think and act based on a single comment is * exactly * what you 're complaining about , / u/tepadno . 
  edit : spelling, 
  interesting observation . 
  at the end of the day , however , reddit is only meant to be light entertainment , and that concept does seem to be working for most . 
  you 're excused , / u/lohrenswald . 
  true , we are all cogs in a greater machine that runs non-stop . 
  by the way , is there a subreddit where these and other crazy conspiracies can be savoured and laughed at ? 
  great example and comparison !, 
  did the majority of you react favourably to the change in design ? 
  good question , and i 'm glad you asked !, 
  there 's a perfectly logical and easily understandable explanation ... ( ... and i hope someone has it . ), 
  i once chatted with an artist who said , `` true art can only be derived out of chaos . '', 
  our government in germany certainly is n't an art-form , it 's where things get done efficiently , and ( although sometimes admittedly a bureaucratic nightmare ) there is a definite lack of chaos . 
  if your product works well and looks good , why use different tools ? 
  how are you so sure ? 
  recent polls state otherwise , so it would be interesting to read your source . 
  ( thanks ! ), 
  correct . 
  the german chancellor knows this as well , and has not ( yet ) been provoked into a negative response . 
  we 're proud of her behaving like the mature adult that she is , in the face of political train wrecks around the world . 
  marty is certainly going to give angie some stiff competition . 
  however the race continues , we 're fortunate to have these candidates . 
  they both mirror the general stability here in germany , the capability to deal with problems that arise domestically and internationally , and a solid foundation in our functioning political system . 
  i 'd like to see a massive turn-out at the polls !,
