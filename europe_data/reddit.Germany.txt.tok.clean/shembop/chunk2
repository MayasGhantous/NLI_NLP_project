  uh oh ... somebody is quick to have a preconceived notion as to the background of who they 're passively poking fun at . 
  there is another nation with a government ` brainwashing ' its people . 
  it 's called the united states . 
  dude . 
  it 's going to be a close race , indeed !, 
  let 's hope every german gets out there to cast their vote ( s ) !, 
  no , we 're not . 
  the unification tax however , { 5,5 % ! }, 
  is ( thankfully ) being brought to an end in 2020 !, 
  woah ... my comment was meant as a light-hearted observation . 
  sorry that i dug up * that * reaction . 
  ps do n't read too much into flag-flairs ; i 'm originally from canada . 
  edit : an afterthought : it 's obvious why you touch upon nazi references , considering your post history . 
  ( i 'll take my apology back now . ), 
  that seems to be quite a one-sided , somewhat `` nationalistic '' dream , no ? 
  * `` cheering crowds greet the german chancellor ( schulz ) as newspapers herald him for saving greece and the euro ... ) '' * this scenario was amusing to read , but highly unlikely . 
  so how do you decide in beautiful sweden who has to shovel the car out of the driveway tomorrow morning ? 
  why would the commission see `` eu countries agreeing among themselves on the areas on which they want to cooperate more efficiently '' as a problem ? 
  why would the commission see * `` eu countries agreeing among themselves on the areas on which they want to cooperate more efficiently '' * as a problem ? 
  * '' ... very well crafted ... '' * that 's ... uhm , `` diplomatically '' put . 
  in the subreddits i frequent ( which are , generally speaking , quite ` diverse ' ) i rarely encounter hostilities towards germany or its people ( like myself ) . 
  would you care to provide us with a couple of examples where you 've encountered these bad vibes ? 
  maybe there 's an explanation that we can provide , if we know where the negativity is coming from . 
  hallo from d\u00fcsseldorf, 
  yeah , germany is doing pretty good , despite the recent immigration issues . 
  we make mistakes , but we learn from them , and we try to make living and working here ( aside from the typical bureaucratic nightmares involved ) as pleasant for every contributor to our positive society as possible . 
  it 's good to be here . 
  welcome to deutschland !, 
  that 's still 11 % too much for the afd . 
  but it 's going to be a very interesting vote , to be certain !, 
  let 's hope there 's a huge turn-out at the ballot boxes . 
  how * dare * you compare our glorious vaterland like that ? 
  but seriously , it has a lot to do with the amount of redditors who are german , as well as ex-pats living here plus interested future wanna-be citizens ... and of course folks who simply are fascinated by everything ` german-esque ' . 
  being a proud canadian and a proud german , i object to your generalization of justin trudeau 's attitude , especially how you drag a ridiculous rant about obama into the equation . 
  there is no country in the * world * where 100 % of its citizens are satisfied with their leaders . 
  a few redditors on / r/canada voice their negative opinions , and that 's good . 
  the overwhelming majority however are satisfied with the pm 's direction and leadership . 
  also , many of the folks who are disappointed in the turn-around of a promise of electoral reform fail to see the entirety of the situation . 
  edit : spelling/sentence structure, 
  `` oooh , heaven is a place on earth ... '' ... and it sounds like greece on tsiknopempti !, 
  jt is heading to berlin and then hamburg . 
  wish i was able to shake his hand , but it 's unlikely he 'd come to d\u00fcsseldorf . 
  ( even if we * do * have `` the longest bar in the world . '' ), 
  ah well , maybe next time . 
  my big fat greek thursday, 
  i lost my wallet once . 
  someone turned it in anonymously . 
  that was nice . 
  finland 2 . 
  czech republic 3 . 
  sweden 6 . 
  norway 7 . 
  australia 8 . 
  taiwan 9 . 
  germany 11 . 
  france 12 . 
  poland 13 . 
  netherlands 14 . 
  south africa 16 . 
  singapore 17 . 
  mexico 19 . 
  south korea, 
  this , and your other two posts here on reddit make no sense . 
  what are you trying to tell us ? 
  ( oh and before you start , do n't . 
  that was a hypothetical question . 
  i actually do n't care . ), 
  truly overblown , yes !, 
  considering that the official amount of gold holdings in america is around 8133.5 tonnes ( and germany in second place with 3395.5 ) these numbers are minuscule . 
  also interesting : the bank of england 's bullion vault . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cttf5s2hfka an interesting video from periodic videos . 
  remembering our past is part of it . 
  the goal we are constantly working on is `` learning '' from the past , to make a better future for germany , and to show the world that even a truly distorted sense of nationalistic pride and division of people can be reversed . 
  if germany can do it , there is hope for even the most messed-up countries . 
   `` national lazy day , whose us origins elude slothful researchers , has reached germany 's newspapers . 
  alongside its front page focus on donald trump 's `` fire '' and `` fury , '' die welt urged its readers to simply chill out . '', 
  also , if you 're going to copy/paste something out of an article , kindly put it in quotation marks or similar . 
  in order to make it visible that it is n't your * own * comment . 
  ( even if only a very small amount of people actually understand what you 're posting , / u/mberre . 
  ** and ** we should * never * forget , that :  `` the final demand vector of country r is defined as the sum over the demand categories f r = cr + gr + kr , where gr is the public consumption vector of country r , and kr is the investment vector . 
  given the data , we can compute the total final demand of country r ( fr ) and the demand composition vectors ( sfr , scr , sgr , skr ) . '', 
  save a click :  `` when asked at a press conference in berlin whether germany would `` stand by the u.s. in case of war , '' merkel did not respond directly but said : `` i consider an escalation of rhetoric the wrong answer . ''  `` i do not see a military solution to this conflict , '' she added . 
  instead , the chancellor suggested that the crisis should be resolved through the united nations security council and cooperation between the u.s. and regional powers like china , south korea and japan . 
  as much as i disapprove of stereotypical generalisations , through my own experience i have to say : you 're absolutely correct . 
  writing `` probably a german queer '' with an arrow pointing to a picture of chancellor angela merkel in a newspaper article entitled `` europe has no option . '', 
  i do n't know ` harry and paul ' , but this 2-minute piece is in a traditional farcical style with a thought-pondering climax . 
  well done !, 
  true , watsupbitchez ... but you speak only of the present . 
  germany is speaking for the future . 
   i did n't read the whole article ... 
  exactly . 
  a fascinating write-up from time magazine . 
  the fake-news situation is truly a matter of our time . 
   `` the better approach , he says , might be introduce a fact-checking curriculum in schools and make students more aware of their sources of information . 
  but that educational approach will take years to have an impact , and in the meantime fake news technology will continue to advance . 
  in a study published in july , academics at the university of washington created software to `` synthesize '' a video of barack obama delivering lines he had never actually spoken . 
  `` from a technical point of view , you can create videos that look absolutely like they are real , '' says hegelich , who continued advising the german government after that first meeting with merkel in november . 
  right now , it would take hours if not days to produce a forensic analysis showing that such a video is fake , and by then its impact would be almost irreversible . 
  at the very least , it would make voters in germany or elsewhere unsure of what to believe as they head to the polls . 
  `` it leaves a trace of doubt over everything , '' says hegelich .
