  save a click to government-friendly hurriyet :  `` president recep tayyip erdo\u011fan has strongly slammed germany 's threats to impose economic sanctions on turkey amid ongoing tension in ties , saying germany will be the one to pay the price in the event that it imposes an embargo . 
   `` you have to take into account a bigger price [ that you have to pay ] if you think you can frighten turkey with your threats of embargo , '' erdo\u011fan told ruling justice and development party ( akp ) lawmakers at a weekly meeting in parliament on july 25 . 
   we see that the firms of this country are smarter , more visionary , more prudent than its politicians , erdo\u011fan said , noting that german investments in turkey were uninterrupted despite german politicians ' threat . 
   germany is revealing its real intentions through threats over the economy as the ministers of the country warn turkey of avoiding investments , the president said . 
   the president said the turkish government has never rebuffed foreign investments in turkey , adding there were german companies operating in the country for more than a century . 
   erdo\u011fan 's remarks followed statements from berlin that suggested imposing some economic sanctions and issuing travel warnings for german tourists that visiting the country will be at their own risk . 
   germany on july 20 told its citizens to exercise caution if traveling to turkey and threatened measures that could hinder german investment there , as its impatience grew with ankara after the detention of rights activists . 
   turkey this month detained several human rights activists , including a german and the local head of rights group amnesty international , as part of the widespread crackdown that followed last year 's failed coup . 
   german foreign minister sigmar gabriel has said berlin 's policies toward turkey should go in a `` new direction '' and noted he could not advise companies to invest in a country without legal certainty . 
   turkish authorities had reportedly handed berlin a list of almost 700 german companies several weeks ago , including daimler and basf , who they had accused of having links to the u.s.-based islamic preacher fethullah g\u00fclen , who is believed to have orchestrated last july 's failed coup . 
   the turkish government has later withdrawn its inquiry suggesting a miscommunication . 
   erdo\u011fan said , despite the correction , german politicians were still escalating the tension between ankara and berlin . 
   he indirectly blamed germany for conducting `` bloody massacres '' in the first and second world wars . 
   `` those who have not avoided bloodshed have no right to criticize us , '' the president said , in reference to the detention of foreign citizens in turkey . 
   foreign spies are `` swarming '' turkey and the turkish government will `` walk all over '' them when the time comes , erdo\u011fan stated . '',

  save a link to whatever intellinews.com is :  `` turkey 's recep tayyip erdogan blasted germany , nato , washington and israel in a speech to his party on july 25 , accusing foreign agents of attempting to `` break my country up into pieces '' . 
   some analysts speculated that the speech might signal that ankara is accelerating its political realignment away from the west and towards moscow . 
  in his speech , erdogan defiantly vowed that turkey would move ahead with its purchase of s-400 advanced missile defence batteries from russia , which would be incompatible with the systems of fellow nato members . 
   erdogan 's lashing out came the day after there were some signs that ankara was feeling the heat from a german reorientation of policy towards turkey which might threaten its tourism industry and investment environment . 
   `` you 're going to prevent turkey 's president and ministers from speaking in your country , but your agents are going to swarm in , come to hotels here and break my country up into pieces ? '' erdogan said , according to bloomberg . 
  `` that 's not going to happen . 
  either you 're going to show respect for our sovereign rights , you 're going to be partners , friends and allies on just and equal terms , or you 're going to get a response to every act of disrespect . ''  `` god willing , we 'll see [ the russian missile batteries ] in our country soon , '' erdogan also reportedly said , claiming that turkey had worked for years to buy similar systems from the us but was not able to seal a deal allowing joint production . 
  `` if we ca n't get what we want from america , we have to search elsewhere , '' he was reported as saying . 
   erdogan also called on all muslims to visit jerusalem and the al-aqsa mosque . 
  the site has triggered recent israeli-palestinian unrest and erdogan has joined those voices claiming israel is attempting to take the mosque away from muslims . 
   part of berlin 's toughened policy against turkey includes suspending arms deals involving the country until all such transactions are reviewed . 
   germany was quite restrained in its response to erdogan prior to the april referendum on introducing an executive presidency in turkey , when the president aimed nazi jibes at the germans after turkish ministers were barred from addressing expatriate turkish voters . 
   however , berlin has grown increasingly unsettled at what it sees as turkey 's blatant disregard for human rights -- including those of many journalists -- amid the state of emergency in the country , introduced after the attempted coup in july last year and recently extended by another three months . 
  it has also been angered by turkey 's refusal to allow german delegations to visit german troops stationed in turkey . 
   german ministers have spoken of not allowing ankara to blackmail berlin . '',
