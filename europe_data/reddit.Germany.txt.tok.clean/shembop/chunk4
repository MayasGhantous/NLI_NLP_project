  * `` one of the reasons rome has such a limited subway system for a metropolis is that construction of an underground transport line inevitably reveals layers of what had been buried slices of life from one of the ancient world 's most important capitals .

  wonderful images !, 
  certainly an issue that should not be disregarded . 
  i am personally not a conspiracy theorist , but am aware of the political weight that the papers carry . 
  i must admit , my first reaction to the entire piece was , `` who in the government pushed their agenda via this story onto die zeit ? 
  unfortunately , the authenticity of this picture is doubted ( photoshopped ) , but the idea is certainly pleasant . 
  die zeit is a highly respected paper , and the idea of a eu-army is certainly newsworthy , but the excessive cotton candy graphic did make me furrow my brow . 
  from bloomberg web support :  hello :  thank you for your message . 
   the graphis was from last year . 
   the reporters were aware of the error , and updated version was already published last year .

  save a click to dailysabah.com : ** german parliament votes to withdraw troops from turkey 's incirlik air base ** germany 's bundestag voted late wednesday to withdraw troops from turkey 's incirlik air base . 
  the vote came after recently strained relations between the two countries , as berlin had announced on june 7 that german troops stationed in the southern turkish base would be moved to a military facility in jordan . 
  the german government has also decided to withdraw its refueling and reconnaissance aircraft from incirlik base to azraq , jordan , after tensions between the two countries rose in late may after a german parliamentary delegation was not allowed to visit the base . 
  the move was in response to germany 's attitude towards turkish deputies during the recent constitutional referendum period where turkish officials were barred from holding meetings in germany , drawing a strong reaction from ankara . 
  pkk sympathizers have long used germany as a safe haven for activities , including recruitment and collecting financial support , as well as openly holding rallies in german cities , despite the group being listed as a terrorist organization by the eu , u.s. and turkey . 
  in addition , after the coup attempt on july 15 , 2016 in turkey , suspected fet\u00d6 members have sought asylum in germany despite being wanted by ankara for their alleged involvement in the coup bid . 
   the euro zone has done a lot to support greece since its fiscal crisis began . 
  athens has been granted no fewer three rescue packages , worth 326 billion euros in total . 
  the euro zone has allowed generous grace periods for official loans , extended their maturities and lowered the interest rate . 
  as a result , greece 's debt repayments are actually quite manageable for now . 
  so very true !, 
  true . 
  it 's a shame that / r/europe in general has become so controversial . 
  it 's a long read , but a truly fascinating study of where europe stands . 
  here 's an example : ** where next for europe ? 
  ** * `` for almost a decade now , the eu has been navigating continual challenges and crises . 
  as its leaders debate the post-brexit future , its institutions are struggling to project an image of effectiveness and legitimacy . 
  meanwhile , member states are grappling with different levels of wealth , growth , competitiveness and income inequality , as well as with the divisive legacy of the eurozone and refugee crises . 
  as this paper makes clear , these challenges can only be addressed successfully by taking into account public and elite opinion . 
  the article refers to a total of 1,3 million ** migrants ** , true . 
  however , this number includes children and people who are unable to be employed . 
   contributing nothing ? 
  they are a couple hundred thousand `` ... people fleeing war and political persecution . '' the majority of germans ( myself included ) gladly help . 
  buddy of mine drove his bike last month through iran . 
  apparently , they 're the nicest folks you 've ever met . 
  again , no . 
  it 's obvious after reading your other posts , / u/shogunexplosion , that you are a person with an agenda . 
  you obviously have a preconceived notion about germany . 
  i find your stereotyping of us primitive and representative of the followers of one of your favourite reddits . 
  please return to t_d and bury your head under ground like the rest of them . 
  - yes - yes, 
  from fortune.com : ** germany plans to fingerprint children and spy on personal messages ** * germany is planning a new law giving authorities the right to look at private messages and fingerprint children as young as 6 , the interior minister said on wednesday after the last government gathering before a national election in september . 
  * * ministers from central government and federal states said encrypted messaging services , such as whatsapp and signal , allow militants and criminals to evade traditional surveillance . 
  * * `` we ca n't allow there to be areas that are practically outside the law , '' interior minister thomas de maiziere told reporters in the eastern town of dresden . 
  * * militant attacks in france , britain and germany have prompted european governments to tighten up on surveillance of suspected militants . 
  britain has proposed forcing messaging services to let authorities access encrypted communications . 
  * * among the options germany is considering is `` source telecom surveillance '' , where authorities install software on phones to relay messages before they are encrypted . 
  that is now illegal . 
  * * austria is also planning laws to make it easier to monitor encrypted messages as well as building out a linked network of cameras and other equipment to read vehicle licence plates . 
  * * last december 's lorry attack on a berlin christmas market , in which 12 were killed and germany 's struggle to integrate thousands of refugees , have put security high up the political agenda before an election in which german chancellor angela merkel is seeking a fourth term in office . 
  * * ministers also agreed to lower the age limit for fingerprinting minors to 6 from 14 for asylum seekers . 
  * * bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann , a merkel ally whose south-eastern state is the entry point for many refugees fleeing war in the middle east , said on june 3 he wanted security services to be allowed to monitor children . 
  * * that proposal encountered strong opposition in germany , where the memories of spying in the communist and nazi run deep . 
  * * `` children are victims of extremism , '' said social democrat family affairs minister katharina barley , who said authorities should be protecting children not spying on their friends.ministers also agreed to improve communication between the many different regional and national police and investigation agencies in the highly decentralized country . 
  from reuters.com : ** three uk men questioned after easyjet flight diverted to cologne **  german authorities are questioning three british men detained after their conversations on board an easyjet flight from slovenia to london prompted the pilot to divert to cologne , germany , a local police spokesman said . 
   no explosives were found in their luggage or on the plane and a spokeswoman for the airport said the remaining passengers were scheduled to fly on to london around 1100 gmt . 
   nine people received medical treatment after all 151 passengers were evacuated from the airbus 319 aircraft using emergency slides . 
   the pilot diverted the flight from ljubljana to cologne on saturday evening after passengers reported that the men were talking about `` terrorist matters '' , police and state prosecutors said in a joint statement . 
   bild newspaper quoted a spokesman for the german federal police as saying the pilot decided to land the aircraft in cologne after passengers told airline personnel they had heard the men using words including `` bomb '' and `` explosive '' . 
   the men were aged 31 , 38 and 48 , a spokesman for cologne police said . 
   bild newspaper said the men worked for a london company and were returning to london after a business trip . 
   a backpack that belonged to the men was examined and destroyed in a controlled explosion by authorities but no dangerous contents or explosives were found in the bag or on board the aircraft , a police spokesman said . 
   police and prosecutors had said they were investigating a suspicion that the men were preparing to carry out , `` a serious violent crime that could have jeopardized the state '' . 
   on sunday , the police spokesman said it was unclear if any charges would be brought against the men . 
   the airport spokeswoman said air traffic had returned to normal after a three-hour interruption on saturday evening . 
  seventeen arriving flights were diverted to other airports , 20 departing flights were significantly delayed and two flights were canceled , the airport said . 
   no additional passengers were detained , the police spokesman said . 
  agreed . 
  there 's definitely a growing right-wing faction lately . 
  getting pretty dark here in / r/europe 's threads ... 
  here 's hoping everybody else turns on their lights !, 
  i 'm glad i 'm not alone on this , and thanks for mentioning , / u/koproller . 
  for years , reuters was my go-to for ( relatively ) ` unbiased ' journalism . 
  * `` just the facts , ma'am '' * i 'll gladly take the downvotes for mentioning i 've simply been wondering about the change of reuter 's tone .
