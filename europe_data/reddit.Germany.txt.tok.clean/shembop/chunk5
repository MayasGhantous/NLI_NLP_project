  absolutely agreed , / u/w1nter !, 
  of course it 's not just this * single * article that would make me rethink my positive thoughts about reuters standards . 
  there have simply been a couple of headers recently that simply make me go ` hmmm ' . 
  the majority of your posts ( like this one ) are intolerant racist gibberish , / u/pajeetpoo . 
  take it somewhere else . 
  only three paragraphs , and one of them mentions merkel coming under fire for allowing refugees to enter germany . 
  reuters , you are making me rethink my attitude towards your journalistic qualities . 
  oh crap , no way !?!, 
  were the drawn numbers typical calendar dates ? 
  ( sorry , but i had to chuckle at that one . ), 
  some ` people ' ( a.k.a. 
  arschl\u00f6cher ) apparently are , but the vast majority of germans are tolerant to the lgbt-community . 
  and although every crime is certainly one too many , the overall statistics show that these incidents are relatively rare compared to other crimes . 
  uk loses its appeal . 
  eu workers look elsewhere for jobs . 
  true !, 
  all those young whipper-snappers at reuters with their rock and roll and hoppity-hip music . 
  ( i 'm old . ), 
  here 's an excellent write-up and analysis of the line . 
  http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/an-offer-he-cant-refuse.html ** also ** http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=make%20you%20an%20offer%20you%20can%27t%20refuse, 
  i must disagree that he meant it like that , especially since ( after reading the article again ) , i see no negative approach for future talks and considerations . 
  maybe i 'm just naive and ca n't read between the lines . 
  i can ** really ** see where you 're coming from , trucidator , ** if ** he was inclined to approach the problem in a forceful manner in the future ... ( but i hope he would n't do that . ), 
  all the very best from dusseldorf !, 
  hmmm ... 
  i think you and i are on two different pages , trucidator . 
  i see what you 're trying to say , but we 're looking at the placement of the godfather comment from two different perspectives . 
  if i recognise his situation correctly , pierre moscovici does n't want to ** force ** his blueprint on anybody , ( like you appear to uphold ) . 
  he wants to make the transition to the economic and monetary union by 2025 as pleasant as possible , and this contradicts his hollywood quote . 
  edit : but i do agree entirely with your very valid point above , that , * `` this is one of the reasons why brexit is so interesting . 
  it does n't just have massive implications for the uk , it forces the eu to face up to difficult questions too , that previously it ignored . 
  disagreed . 
  he should have stated something similar to an `` unbeatable '' offer , but not saying the framework is attractive enough which he thinks makes `` it an offer you ca n't refuse . '', 
  putting a gun to a temple and forcing a signature , or else `` bada-bing , you got brains all over the table '' is hardly an attractive offer . 
  * `` we will try to make a framework that is attractive enough , that is like , as they say in the movies , an offer you can not refuse , '' pierre moscovici told reporters ... '' * ** also ** * '' ... he said the commission has no power and no will to force countries to adopt the euro by a certain date ... '' * ** he obviously does not recognise the reference to the godfather , and what it actually means . 
  thank * you * for your reply !, 
  your opinion is by no means ill-informed , greg . 
  quite the contrary , even if one would n't agree with your way of thinking , your arguments are well-stated with a logical foundation and a reasonable structure . 
  good on you !, 
  could you please explain your thought development on why you think the eu would want to make an example out of the uk , / u/dovah _ gb ? 
  another amusing clip , / u/rewboss !, 
  i always thought you were a german who grew up in the uk with both nationalities ? 
  whatever your background , it certainly provides you with those special insights needed to fill those vids with content .

  its nae good blamin it oan the english fir colonising us . 
  ah do n't hate the english . 
  they 're just wankers . 
  we are colonised by wankers . 
  we ca n't even pick a decent , vibrant healthy society to be colonised by . 
  no . . we are ruled by effete arseholes . 
  what does that make us ? 
  the lowest of the low , the scum of the earth . 
  the most wretched servile , miserable , pathetic trash that was ever shat intae creation .

  ah hate the scots . '' * -- irvine welsh , ** trainspotting **,

  this seems intriguing . 
  from the trailer , it 's like an extreme version of germany 's 80 's big-hair/cars movie ` manta manta ' coupled with a zombie apocalypse and that unmistakable dutch language and humour . 
  only if there is no justification . 
  i only comment on posts after considering the comment history of the redditor in question , ( which shows a history of negativity and racism , including this one . ), 
  i 'm just holding up a mirror , although admittedly ineffectively . 
  what 's really ` wrong ' here is your grammar and your attitude , / u/penisastronaut . 
  attention , world : germany does not react to urging from religious organizations . 
  please take op 's post with a grain of salt . 
  thank you !, 
  op 's profile is 14 minutes old , and he posted this three or four times . 
  some sort of propaganda , to be sure , albeit indecipherable as to what his agenda is . 
  but i hope he is n't dissing germany , or exclaiming that we ** react ** to the spurrings of a religious movement , ( which we do not ) . 
  edit : added a 'd ', 
  interesting comment , / u/xnicolex !, 
  can you source that statement , because it would be fascinating to read a study on the ratio of certain political ideals to different professions . 
  * '' ... responding with reforms , including revising one of the force 's post-nazi era founding principles ... ( of ) `` traditionserlass , '' a policy last updated in 1982 that gives a differentiated view of how troops are to treat and view the legacy of the german military . 
  '' * no worries , / r/europe . 
  there 's bound to be a few bad eggs in every basket . 
  contrary to what you may hear out of germany ( or elsewhere ) , the bundeswehr is not filled with a majority of soldiers who are far right-wing , and we 're not marching anywhere to take over . 
  your `` classic '' comment ( and many of your previous posts ) all have something in common , / u/hrc _ prc : they were written by a damaged person . 
  go away . 
  ... or a link to the department or a story about them or anything else that would add to the picture ? 
  at the moment , this could be almost anywhere , no ? 
  that certainly is good news just before elections . 
  germany is surely and steadily marching forward . 
  hello 2017 !!, 
  it 's good to be here !, 
  oh yes , of course it 's all the fault of the eu . 
  / s in the future , i see the eu hearing the same rants for many things , even long after the uk has left us ( hopefully with great success and prosperity for them . ), 
  * `` tory mp sir bill cash , chairman of the commons european scrutiny committee , said he was `` certain '' that germany and the eu were trying to influence the general election by undermining mrs may '' * oh stop it . 
  this is simply a political bullsh * t rant with no substance . 
  germany has nothing to gain by using these tactics . 
  whether she wins or loses , that statement is doubtful . 
  - the numbers i.e. 
  ** facts ** are correct . 
  i 'm commenting on ( not attacking ) the `` generalisations and terminology '' . 
  - you * obviously * know me well enough to state that this article does n't fit `` my view '' . 
  it would be interesting to hear your elaboration how you come to this conclusion . 
  sensationalistic journalism . 
  do n't believe the hype , folks . 
  yes , germany ( like many other countries ) has , in the course of the past year , been experiencing crime issues . 
  the generalisations and terminology used in this article however , are exaggerated .
