  edit : is = are edit 2 : the numbers i.e. 
  ** facts ** are correct . 
  i 'm commenting on the `` generalisations and terminology '' . 
  the journalistic structure of the piece is bias . 
  your examples of living in the eu are exemplary and i 'm sure are positively shared by a number of redditors here in / r/europe , including myself . 
  oh i 'm simply requesting a reliable source . 
  i 'd very much like to believe what you say , as it is n't far from the truth . 
  but facts are * always * better than assumptions . 
  the wonderful thing about journalism in germany ( in connection with the majority of its consumers ) , is that we in germany are not as susceptible to `` sensationalistic '' journalism as is the case in the united states . 
  yes , there is fake news and misinformation all around , but the majority of german citizens ** question ** what they read , who is trying to tell them something , and in which way is it portrayed . 
  there its no doubt that donald trump is a questionable president , just as there is no doubt that putin does n't have a white vest . 
  for a number of fundemental reasons , they are ** both * viewed sceptically in germany . 
  woaah slow down , / u/katembers . 
  you 're going to have to provide a ( reliable and well-documented ) source for ** all ** those ( imho slightly exaggerated ) statistics . 
  edit : ( reliable and well-documented ), 
   probably because of immigration aaaaand once again , there we have op 's obvious political motivation . 
  considering this , and many other post from op , he/she obviously has some sort of politically motivated agenda . 
  co-founder of the `` migrant offshore aid station ngo ( non-governmental organisation ) '' says , * `` more would die if we were n't there '' *, 
  it 's too late : the afd is doomed . 
  alright !, 
  thanks so much for those tips !!, 
  will definitely check them out and compare !, 
  best wishes !, 
  i 'm in the middle of d\u00fcsseldorf , and my kiosk on the corner sells both zywiec and tsykie . 
  ( sorry to admit that i * still * do n't know how to correctly pronounce the names , though . ), 
  i hear that a couple of [ polish beers ] ( http://www.tastingpoland.com/food/g/polish_beer_brands.jpg ) are actually pretty good , too . 
  * '' `` we are working on better ties with germany , but we have to tightly control what becomes public information and what does n't , '' a government source familiar with poland 's foreign policy , told reuters . 
  `` it is a difficult task . 
  '' '' * taking it step by step , coming nearer to one another without forcing anybody 's role upon another . 
  bravo , germany and poland !, 
  our sch\u00e4uble says what he means , and does n't take any crap from sensationalistic journalists like matthew lynn from the telegraph . 
  the courageous xavier jugele should be credited for being killed in action on the front lines of the france troubles , and should be commemorated and remembered as such . 
  living in germany and enjoying the freedom of the press from a multitude of high-quality journalistic sources , i can safely say , / u/clovergendered , that my view of the world is indeed ` well-rounded ' . 
  / r/europe is in my humble opinion , not meant to be a platform for propaganda , ( turkish or otherwise ) and i will therefore continue to raise my virtual voice when i see fit . 
  you agree it 's propaganda and post it anyway ? 
  why ?? 
  ( that 's a hypothetical question . 
  i do n't care why . 
  rise above and delete this crap . ), 
  pretty straightforward survey . 
  not really sure if op is conveying some sort of message with this graph . 
  poland is full of wonderful people , and i 've had the chance to get to know some of them . 
  heartfelt and sexy . 
  good luck , uk !, 
  much love from / r/europe !, 
  you both have great taste in european destinations . 
   ... do you ever want to roll your eyes ? 
  true art is what happens behind the eyes of the observer or listener . 
  the physiological and emotional experience that it conjures is different for every person , and some show that reaction more than others . 
  instead of eye-rolling , be happy for the emotionally moved , and move on . 
  greetings from d\u00fcsseldorf, 
  for those on mobile , here are the questions : - do you speak german ? 
  ( this is not a legal requirement , but it really helps finding a job and navigating the bureaucratic hurdles . ), 
  are you willing to learn german ? 
  ( if no , stop right here and forget it . ), 
  - are you a german citizen ? 
  - are you an eu citizen ? 
  - are you the spouse of a german / an eu citizen ? 
  - are you the parent of a minor child holding german citizenship ? 
  - are you a non-eu citizen who has permanent unlimited residency in one of the other eu countries ? 
  - are you are unhcr-recognised refugee with official permission to move to germany ? 
  ( permission needs to be in writing with your name and details on it . ), 
  - do you qualify for eu blue card ? 
  - are you in other ways specifically qualified ? 
  ( bsc in it , msc in stem degrees , phd in other subjects , long-term job experience in a very specific , narrow and in-high-demand field , ... ? ), 
  - are you a recent graduate of a german university ? 
  - if you are not a recent graduate , do you have ba/bsc degree and could you do a masters degree in germany ? 
  either financed by yourself or through a daad scholarship ? 
  - if you are not a recent graduate and do not have a ba/bsc degree , can you get hold of around 9000 eur per year for a period of 4-5 years so that you can get a ba/bsc degree in germany ? 
  - do you have enough cash so that you can found a company here in germany ? 
  ( see 21.1.4 avwv , this normally means investing at least 250.000 euro along with creating at least 5 full-time jobs in germany . 
  these requirements can be lower , but then you better have a really good business plan and can support yourself and your family on your savings while your company gets going . ), 
  - are you a citizen of a country listed under 41 ( 1 ) aufenthv ( = australia , israel , japan , canada , south korea , new zealand , usa ) and have the qualifications and talents necessary to work freelance ? 
  - is there any other reason why you staying and working in germany would in any way benefit german society and or german economy ? 
  ( example : you want to move to germany because you intend to take care of an elderly or disabled relative who would otherwise would end up in a nursing home or other long-term care on the german taxpayers euros . ), 
  - do you qualify for a working holiday visa ? 
  germany currently has working holiday agreements with australia , new zealand , canada , japan , hong kong , south korea and taiwan . 
  - are you a visiting scientist ? 
  - are you a student enrolled in a university and do you plan to do an internship that is mandatory ? 
  - do you plan to come to germany as an au-pair ? 
  if you 're interested in germany , this link will help : https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/working/requirements if the answer to all of these requirements is `` no '' , forget germany . 
  if however you indeed fufill these requirements , `` willkommen in deutschland '' !, 
  how is this understandable ? 
  * sigh * yet another loaded question , meant only to either spread bad vibes or karma-whore . 
  any gothic-themed place in edinburgh . 
  deutsch . 
  it 's easy to learn , so melodic , soft and pleasant to the ears . 
  surely deutsch is the greatest language . 
  things might be looking up !, 
  look what i found : http://www.cornwalllive.com/jellyfish-crisps-are-a-thing-now-and-cornwall-could-cash-in/story-30461192-detail/story.html, 
  no , and any assumption or imagination otherwise would be ridiculous and glaringly uninformed . 
  a mindful state of a geographic entity . 
  humble pie, 
  ( pop .5000 ) https://youtu.be/ozddycyrcne?t=46s, 
  til . 
  thanks for sharing that info . 
  looking at pics of cornwall , and knowing people who have wanted to show me that beautiful part of the world , i find it hard to put cornwall and poor/undeveloped region in one sentence . 
  but hey , you live there , so i guess you 'd know better . 
  how to tip in germany : from / u/rewboss https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7kv_dtltdpc, 
  without a doubt , germany has contributed to the rest of the world by proving that a politically and ideologically brainwashed country can be the root of devastation , hostility , hatred , mistrust and horrifying atrocities .
