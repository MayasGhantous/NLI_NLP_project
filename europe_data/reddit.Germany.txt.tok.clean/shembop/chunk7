  that itself is n't new on our planet ... the difference is that germany has learned from its mistakes , has humbly asked for forgiveness , is consistently trying to make the world a better place by opening its doors ( albeit in a way that was and still is also a learning process ) , and unifying itself by breaking down walls and bringing people together in a span of only a few decades . 
  that is germany 's greatest contribution : if we can do it , so can everybody else !, 
  [ lech wa\u0142\u0119sa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lech_wa\u0142\u0119sa ) for the win !, 
  guess what , / u/inagbusnah ? 
  you trying to come over here with that kind of attitude actually sucks . 
  you 'd be contributing to problems we 're dealing with as best we can , because you consider your country to be evil . 
  you obviously have no clue whatsoever what an `` evil '' country is capable of doing to its citizens . 
  stay where you are and contribute to your society . 
  it is . 
  no , / u/syriansimba , you are ** not ** just curious about this . 
  your history of racist comments and agenda-filled hatred is convincing enough not to get into any discussion whatsoever with you . 
  / u/syriansimba , it 's you again with another ridiculous post . 
  alright , i 'll say it ... 
  i do n't understand what your question really is , / u/throwaway _ hazelnut . 
  your post is all over the place and incoherent . 
  well , if you 've * always been taught not to discuss politics * , then say , ** `` i 'd rather not discuss politics '' ** and move on . 
  ( ah well , we love you anyway . 
  / not s ), 
  the biggest con to living here in germany is the geographical restrictions in the media . 
  `` we are sorry , but the uploader has not allowed viewing in your country . '', 
  or , `` due to copyright issues , we are not able to broadcast in germany . 
  please refer to [ insert your favorite television show here ] . de '', 
  yes , i absolutely feel this . 
  the times have unfortunately changed since britain was an imperial power with worldwide responsibilities , and this is evident in many forms of british thinking today . 
  as much as i do not support generalisations , there are a couple of valid points to be observed . 
  allow me to suggest a few interesting articles : - [ brexit exposes britain 's massive inferiority complex ] ( https://newrepublic.com/article/134513/brexit-exposes-britains-massive-inferiority-complex ) - [ `` comedy is the microcosm that allows us to analyse our culture '' ] ( https://youtu.be/8k2abqtbxao?t=2m57s ) - [ enda walsh : brexit result reflects british ` inferiority complex ' ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/enda-walsh-brexit-result-reflects-british-inferiority-complex-1.2715791 ) - [ admittedly a bit ` iffy ' to post a political blog , but it 's just meant as another example ] ( http://samsonblinded.org/blog/british-inferiority-complex.htm ) - [ a fascinating article based on historical issues of britain 's ` longstanding envy of germany ' from eandt.org ] ( https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2016/11/britains-longstanding-envy-of-germany/ ) there are many other references from all sorts of areas i could post here , but i want to assure anybody reading this , that not everybody is messed-up , and i hold the brits in high regard . 
  my term of `` undoubtable but misplaced inferiority complex '' stands however , backed on historical and contemporary sources . 
  edit : darn you , auto-fill : corrected the source from enact.org to eandt.org ( engineering and technology ) . 
   is this satire . 
  you posted what i thought to be a serious question , / u/zz2113 . 
  it 's a shame that i actually have to point out that it was meant as whole-hearted comment ( especially since you and i have canadian backgrounds ) , but it could also be that these are rarely read here . 
  all the best to you anyway . 
  i 'd like to see a mutually benificial and amicable seperation , as well as the future growth of the uk , not only economically , but most importantly with a newly found , positive self-identification . 
  their heads held high , surrounded by the cultural depth and historical strength which builds their character and backbone of a unified , but also independant land . 
  this has been forgotten in recent times , and it has led to an undoubtable but misplaced inferiority complex . 
  at the moment , the uk 's future is like a beautiful antique piece of furniture waiting under a dustcloth to be rediscovered and brought to new glanz and into a sun-drenched room by day , and a gorgeously lit ballroom by night . 
  after this whole brexit business is behind us , germany will be quite happy for the uk , and ready to watch them enjoy their wave of success . 
  greetings from d\u00fcsseldorf , germany, 
  just for the general discussion : are you asking about our perception of the gambling and entertainment mecca of paradise , ( which is often confused with vegas ) ? 
  or do you actually want to know what we think of las vegas as it is portrayed on tv , in films , and experienced as a tourist attraction ? 
  do n't believe the hype . 
  come visit and find out how rewarding and fulfilling a trip to europe , and especially germany ( * shameless plug * ) can be . 
  true ... but not poodles . 
  `` you were once a wolf . 
  what happened ... ? '', 
  we 're not that picky in germany to expect tourists to speak bits and pieces of our language . 
  at least we 're not as picky as our french neighbours . 
  ( they are stereotypically associated with being distant and cold with those who make absolutely no attempt to say please or thank-you . ), 
  however , there is a general consensus and expectation to learn german relative to the amount of time newcomers spend here . 
  that means , if you 've been here for six months and ca n't order a schweinshaxe in a restaurant , that seems a bit lazy to us . 
  if you 've been here for twenty years and ca n't fit a sentence together because you have n't made any effort to learn , then that 's kinda disrespectful . 
  ( fellow germans , please feel free to correct me or point out anything wrong with this observation . 
  it is in no way meant to be hate-speech for immigrants or ex-pats , as i myself immigrated from canada in the 80 's ) edit : punctuation , and added ` ex-pats ', 
  a few years back , i saw an introductory ` welcome-to-our-country video ' from your former president . 
  he praised skype , made a solid impression , and brought me to consider a visit . 
  practical ... and cute hats , too !, 
  extremely comfortable , and so durable ; a good pair will last you a couple of decades . 
  ( unfortunately , a good pair has its price . ), 
  edit : punctuation, 
  yes ? 
  exactly . 
  when we die and find out god is a pissed-off chicken , we are well and truly fucked . 
  my god 's better than * your * god . 
  what kind of people consider it rude when you decline a drink ? 
  oh my god ... how could i have forgotten that one ? 
  the first german word i ever heard !, 
  yeah i suppose you 're right , but it * is * a swedish ` word ' that carries a worldwide recognition , no ? 
  i say , ` ikea ' is a great word !, 
  is ikea a valid word , too ? 
  * `` mange tak '' * for the excellent word , denmark !, 
  oh we use ombudsman in english , too !, 
  that 's a danish word ? 
  til !, 
  that may be true , but the difference between the danish and the german version is that ` schadenfreude ' has established itself in english , which corresponds to op 's enquiry . 
  edit : spelling , ( again ), 
  be yourself . 
  the rest comes naturally , wherever you are . 
  interesting !, 
  would you care to share your source , so op can get a quick statistics overview to his question ? 
  your flair is usa . 
  chancellor merkel is a highly respected , intelligent politician who has dealt with many situations ( both nationally and internationally ) in a calm and efficient manner . 
  she has remained generally successful in most of her campaigns , and has admitted to mistakes having been made in other endeavours . 
  from the people of germany , ` angie ' has humbly requested working together to help each other move forward , and at the same time , she remains without a doubt the most powerful woman in the world . 
  as to the upcoming elections , she recognizes the influence of the_schultz movement , and is taking the rise of the spd seriously . 
  at the same time , we can say that in the event of her non-re-election , angela merkel would never be a sore loser . 
  in general ... she 's exactly what germany has needed , and it will be interesting to see how the future develops . 
  note : i am not politically affiliated with her nor endorsing her , but rather only expressing my personal opinion . 
  oh please ... !, 
  i have n't read anything more ridiculously stereotypical than your post !, 
  you and your friends are idiots . 
  this is how it 's done in germany . 
  ... and it 's the name of the greatest summer camp movie of all time . 
  what an exciting itinary !!, 
  a word about a'dam : never purchase from anyone on the street , try to refrain from buying pre-rolled joints , and above all : do n't drive under the influence !, 
  so envious !, 
  you 'll have an incredible trip !, 
  the cathedral is well worth a visit , but i would n't plan on spending an entire day in the domstadt . 
  ( i would n't say * `` cologne is shit '' * at all . ), 
  ps : prague truly is absolutely divine !, 
  whereabouts are germany 's vast , bleak wastelands that you travel through so often ?
