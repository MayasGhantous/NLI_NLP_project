  head on down to a walmart in florida my friend . 
  there is a stable of rascal scooters used almost exclusively by fat people . 
  did you not know about this ? 
  * did you not know about freedom ? 
  i would say * sips corona * but my bullethole-riden palms are in los angeles . 
  where are you from ? 
  made by j.j. abrams of the new star treks fame . 
  if you like sci fi , lens flare and slow burning plots you might like fringe . 
  yeah , why did you eat at a taco bell in the us ? 
  if you want shitty food at least go to a cracker barrel ( i do n't tell many people this but i fucking love cracker barrel ) . 
  taco bell is really only for homeless people , college students and drug addicts . 
  edit : agh , responded to the wrong post . 
  i am simultaneously jealous and a little freaked out . 
  i think i 'll just stick to not collecting things . 
  we got rid of pao , now let 's fix the eu !, 
  #dankmemesdomeltsteelbeams / s, 
  but man ... that paper he wrote was beautiful , made me hate the german language too . 
  sign of a great writer i suppose . 
  and besides , the french took our place as laughing stock of the world years ago . 
  man , that sucks . 
  my heart goes out to the victims and their families . 
  it makes me sad to hear about these things in any country , hearing it in germany ... it just hits closer to home is all . 
  well count me corrected !, 
  thanks for the info , 
  do you hunt with an ak ? 
  from my understanding they are not the most accurate of rifles and mounting optics can be such a pain in the ass on them too . 
  a lot of states also have regulations against semi-auto firearms for hunting ( only lever , pump or bolt actions are allowed ) i understand using an ar-15 for hunting ( especially predators like wolves ) but an ak ? 
  i do n't see it as that practical to be honest . 
  have they not already been prosecuted though ? 
  their child died , i doubt they will ever make this same mistake again . 
  is n't the purpose of punishment to either reform someone or to remove a dangerous and dysfunctional person from an otherwise functioning society ? 
  i 'd say that the appropriate punishment has been doled and to send them to jail only for the sanctimonious feeling of `` being just '' is a waste of time and money . 
  let the punishment fit the crime , right ? 
  while this is tragic in the extreme i ca n't help but think that it 's as good a case as any for arguments supporting darwinism . 
  i 'd hate to be in those parents ' shoes though ; as stupid and as laughably ignorant their actions may have been , no one deserves to lose a child . 
  they should not be prosecuted though , the famous and recognized people who spread and support this anti-vaxxer movement need to be for tricking those who did n't know better into losing the most precious thing in their lives . 
  my heart really does go out to them , such a terrible way to learn a lesson . 
   because the people who engage in censorship do not stand for what europe stands for , they do not stand for me or the rest of my people . 
  i know it may sound crazy but people can do one thing while saying another . 
  kind of like the united states `` standing for freedom '' by instituting the patriot act or killing 130,000 civilians ( conservative estimate ) in iraq . 
  if you stand for something or believe in something then do another thing ... well you 're lying and you 're not really standing for said thing . 
  so to take my examples of european censorship and say that they are n't relevant to what europeans stand for because you and `` the rest of your people '' disagree with it seems awfully convenient and a little egocentric . 
  i know it may seem weird to mention here but there is a fantastic south park episode called `` i 'm a little bit country '' which covers this idea fantastically ( although it 's about america and not europe )  we stand for truth , reason and freedom of thought . 
  pray tell , what was the age of enlightenment all about ? 
  i think you answered your own question here but maybe that was on purpose to be condescending . 
  i always thought it was funny that americans could buy a rifle capable of penetrating light body armor and killing from great distances before they were allowed drinking alcohol . 
  every country has it 's own strange laws but that one stuck out to me as very unusual . 
  in most states the lower recievers of ar-15s are considered pistols even though they are part of rifles so you ca n't buy those until you 're 21 either . 
  i guess i 'll just stick with my 1cent ak47 then :( www.gunbroker.com/auction/viewitem.aspx?item=491558244, 
  and are these disingenuous people somehow not counted as european ? 
  how is my linking cases of censorship as a counter argument to a statement as general as : '' ... you can not resort to censorship , because that goes against ** everything ** europe stands for . '', 
  in anyway not helping my case ? 
  if censorship was against `` all that europe stood for '' why are there so many cases of it in europe ? 
  iirc you can not purchase a handgun in the us until you 're 21 so unless it 's a rifle no edgy teenagers will be carrying in colleges . 
  but yeah ... it 's a little dumb to think that everyone having guns would make an environment safer , intro to basic statistics would tell you otherwise . 
  a lot of universities in states that do allow the carrying of firearms will expel a student from carrying on campus so even if it 's made legal by the state it does n't mean that you can carry everywhere . 
  almost clicked until i saw that it was the dailymail . 
  how did said people get in a position to claim that they represent the people of europe ? 
  are europeans completely devoid of any responsibility for their elected leadership ? 
  maybe read my link again , it 's all about europe and , therefore , europeans . 
  and just for good measure let 's put some more links here : [ i ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/08/inside-europes-censorship-machinery/ ) [ could ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_italy ) [ do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_the_united_kingdom ) [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_censorship_in_germany ) [ all ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_france ) [ day ] ( https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/08/russia-rolling-back-free-expression/ ), 
   if you claim that this subreddit represents europe , then you can not resort to censorship , because that goes against everything europe stands for . 
  maybe you 're confusing [ europe ] ( http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/liste.html?tid=415&amp;art_id=475 ) with a different place ... 
  please just let greece leave . 
  let russia deal with them . 
  who 's chartering these vessels ? 
  why are they not arrested ? 
  bullshit `` we ca n't send them back '' . 
  i 'm sorry , it 's not our problem if we do n't know where to send them to , that is their responsibility . 
  why do people keep coming here ? 
  because we do almost nothing to prevent it . 
  taiwan will deport people if they overstay . 
  the united states will turn you back at the border , also to get public assistance as an illegal alien in the states is almost impossible to do legally . 
  we have no obligation to provide non-citizens the services that actual citizens pay for . 
  how can anyone be outraged by this clown ? 
  was n't the basis of his campaign how much he hated gay people ? 
  did n't two journalists get kicked out of turkey for uncovering vote fraud ? 
  this is not even close to a solution . 
  why would a country pay another one to essentially halt or slow down immigration ? 
  it sounds like a classic way to start blackmailing other countries ( `` you do n't like all the immigrants/illegals that are coming from our country to yours ? 
  how about paying our government ? '' ), 
  maybe i 'm crazy but i really do n't understand why so many governments are bending over backwards to allow people easier immigration . 
  i know some people who lived in taiwan for a few years and they said it was near impossible to fully integrate there ( need to be married but the moment of divorce the visa is over or worked at the same company for five years straight for a permanent residency card ) taiwan never gives passports to foreigners , just residency cards and this says one thing `` you 're not taiwanese '' . 
  a lot of people see this as a bad thing but i really do n't , it 's still possible to live there , it 's possible to live there your whole life if you want to work or marry and stay married ; but the underlying message is still there : `` you are not and never will be taiwanese . '', 
  i really do n't understand how this is even a hot button topic . 
  yes people should be able to travel to and visit the countries in europe . 
  if said people show that they are willing to work and be productive within the society they should be able to stay . 
  the burden of evidence/paperwork etc should be entirely on them though . 
  i 'm decidedly non-religious person and i find a lot of religions in these times prevent progress in more areas than they promote it . 
  i 'm saying this so you understand that the viewpoints i hold concerning islam are not only directed at muslims but also people of other religions that are actively holding society back in the name of some random sky man . 
  every muslim i have met has been nothing but kind to me and treated me with respect and kindness . 
  i liked this . 
  what i did n't like was seeing the women dressed in burkas or hijabs . 
  you may say `` it is their choice '' and that they are `` just practicing their religious freedom of expression '' , at this point i call bullshit . 
  if you take a small girl and tell her ( in more or less words ) that god will punish her unless she covers her face and/or body it is not her choice . 
  it is brainwashing plain and simple . 
  having been raised in a brainwashing cult i am maybe more offended by practices like these than an average person but i think many people agree with me here : much of islam practices and actively defends sexism and this has no place in a modern society . 
  it 's more the consistent refusal to speak english when people ca n't speak french ( not saying every french person does it , i 've just experienced it more with french people than any other country , hell , people in taiwan and china were more eager to speak english and they can barely even speak it ) also harassing women and cheating . 
  my friend was on an exchange semester in taiwan at the same time a lot of frenchies came over .
