  yeah , * officially * there were no us , uk or french troops on the ground in lybia either . 
  an enemy of the balance of power that the us wants , yes . 
  but many europeans do n't see the russians as enemys , we wanted cooperation and many huge inroads towards peaceful coexistance . 
  even to this day , most people do n't even know that the us stationing nuclear missiles in turkey caused the cuba crisis ... 
   i think that 's what russia and eastern ukraine/crimea wants . 
  i believe that this is what the local government of crimea wants but i very much doubt that it would be in russia 's interest . 
  yep . 
  for quite a few years either muslims/generic arabs or the chinese were the designated enemy . 
  well , since the 80 ` ies `` we '' are pro-pakistan , because we needed them for afghanistan . 
  the us even more so than europe but we all know that nobody will want to rock the nato boat with how the 21st century seems to be shaping up ... 
  germany has been trying to cozy up to china for a while now . 
  if our good relations with russia break apart in the near future , i would expect german foreign relations being refocused even more towards china . 
  well , when you like to go an annual vacation on usedom , you also tend to go over the border into poland a lot . 
  i had high hopes that this link would lead to that quote of sir humphrey explaining why different countries joined the eu ... 
  in germany all political power comes from the party . 
  ( it even says so right in the constitution . ), 
  there is no realistic chance to even get elected without being favourited by party leadership . 
  granted , you might win a communal election as an independent but if you want to rise to state or even federal level , you have to be a loyal party member for years or even decades . 
  and getting to a point were you can expect to win a seat in a federal election on your own takes even longer , because only 50 % of the seats in the bundestag are elected by direct county votes . 
  all the other ones get apportioned in proportion to the percentage of votes the respective party got in the respective state . 
  the party leadership gets to decide who gets to be an mp and who does n't . 
  thus the mps are wholely dependant on the leadership in every way , not just for funding . 
  i 'm german but have a non-german name . 
  i get held and have my passport/id card checked electronically * every fucking time * i crossed a border checkpoint into germany . 
  every time i arrived on a plane they wanted to check my baggage for contrabant etc. ... racist fucks . 
  yay for schengen abolishing boarder checkpoints !, 
  it was a ridiculously obvious smear campain from the start . 
  i hated the guy for his politics and he definitely was a crook doing many other shady ( and probably corrupt ) things . 
  but i really struggle to find words to describe this entire * farce * ... anyways , we should all take this as a learning opportunity and remember that we should n't just trust some random hack at a newspaper , especially when the paper has an axe to grind . 
   no need to cast a godwin here . 
  but the fact of the matter * is * that the 5 % hurdle was introduced into the federal republic 's constitution as a reaction to the extreme number of factions that the previous attempt at democracy had ended up with . 
  that does n't have anything to do with godwin 's law , it 's just a matter of practicality . 
  reminds me of this guy : http://civil.ge/files/images/2012/saakashvilivote2012.jpg, 
  resigning early in a scandal can actually be extremely effective at ensuring a comeback . 
  he just has to lay low for a couple of years . 
  because they are a tiny minority that would n't get heard in the real world . 
  they post a disproportionate amount of comments , because that issue is more important to then than it is to all the normal people . 
  just look at the handful of `` murrica fuck yeah ! '', 
  people on this sub . 
  it 's really only a few people and we should just ignore them . 
  also , we tend to notice the odd things more , while the hundreds or thousands of normal comments just mash together in our perception . 
  entering the euro is very dangerous and can have far-reachiong implications . 
  set the exchange rate too low and you get uncompetitive wages and low buying power . 
  set it too high and your economy will be taken over by cheaper german imports . 
  ( as happened with many other `` peripheral '' economies . ), 
   similarly how baltic states are n't responsible for their part of the ussr-debt . 
  i had n't realised that scotland has declared a revolution for independence . 
  if the money stays unused , it ca n't be injected into the economy . 
  if the uk takes more of their money to pay for flood repair , they have less for thir economy . 
  i see a good argument for using the fund 's money right there . 
  off the top of my head , i 'm probably forgetting the best ones ... [ wir sind helden - nur ein wort ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1fzsn_wir-sind-helden-nur-ein-wort_music ) ( just one word ) a girl is trying to get a guy to speak to her . 
  the music video is especially funny because they have most of the lyrics either on paper cards or act it out ... but there 's a twist . 
  they came to stay . 
  [ juli - geile zeit ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tqcr9njviy ) ( great time ) well , it 's a song about having had a great time but it being over now . 
  [ juli - regen und meer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhodumoxcf0 ) ( rain and sea ) another one about a girl trying to forget a guy . 
  ( `` i tried to manage to hate you but it does n't work . '' ), 
  juli 's lyrics might be a tad melodramatic sometimes - as their songs seem to be about relationships being over more often than not - but overall their songs are n't sad and i enjoy listening to them . 
  [ die \u00c4rzte - schrei nach liebe ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cez17f5btjo ) ( cry for love ) the song is denigrating racists by explaining their xenophobic and violent tendencies as just being a result of not getting attention/love . 
  features heavy use of the word `` arschloch . '', 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x77db4_1000-jahre-sind-ein-tag_tech ) ( what is time ? ), 
  the basic idea is that a kid is asking what time is and he spins it off into a critique of human behaviour . 
  the main message is that there are many important questions that should be asked and that you should never stop asking them . 
  not my favorite song but i included it because to me this song is just so incredibly * german * . 
  fun fact : it was used as the theme music to an educational show for children . 
  [ nena - 99 luftballons ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lur-sgl3uw8 ) yeah , you probably know this one already . 
  anyways , the song was produced at the height of the cold war , when it was all but certain in many german 's minds that * global thermonuclear war * was going to break out sooner rather than later . 
  in this song popstar nena tells the story of 99 balloons being seen on radar screens and how that escalates into aforementioned war . 
  [ jan delay - klar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jg6yipkxva&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;list=pl7a2557b4369cb004 ) just a nice mix of swing and pop . 
  the basic message is that if you want to party , * we are gon na make it happen * . 
  that 's more context than what was given , though . 
  i would vote ` agree ' on your version but without that special interpretation i would vote ` disagree ' . 
  erdogan is currently turning turkey away from what a modern secular liberal democracy should be like . 
  i see no problem with saying that i do n't want such a state in the eu , just as i am disgusted with some of the shit eu member states have pulled lately . 
   or countries being a superpower ( america and china viewed equally unfavorably ) . 
  uhm , the data does n't support this conclusion at all . 
  the swiss right wing nutjobs were making hay with that topic for years now , just like the right wing nutjobs of any country do . 
  what 's special now is that the entire country ( quite narrowly ) voted for the government to do something about the ( percieved ) problem . 
  nasa * is * underfunded when you look at what congress is asking of them . 
  esa projects/missions get funding seperately from each other . 
  when one or more member states want to make something happen , they fund it directly . 
  ( and they get a proportional amount of commercial contracts flowing back into their country from esa , making it an indirect economic subsidy more than anything else . ), 
  basically , if you want to see esa moving faster , tell your government to aprove the funds . 
  human space exploration is n't * sexy * enough , it does n't yield enough economic benefit . 
  anyways , we ( as in : yurop ) now have a human spaceflight program of our own . 
  the heat shield for our new capsule is going on a test flight this year to validate that it works . 
  ariane 6 is being designed right now . 
  if member governments keep funding it , we are likely to see 100 % european manned missions in a few years . 
  these kinds of things come to light quite regularly in all countries . 
  germany once bought sub-par lockheed fighters that the us air force did n't want to buy . 
  they ended up killing hundreds of pilots . 
  later it transpired that the minister of defense had gotten a massive kickback . 
  `` entscheidend ist , was hinten rauskommt '' - ( literally  `` the crucial bit is what exits at the back '' helmut kohl , trying to say that that the end justifies the means . 
  the fact that `` real wages '' ( i.e. 
  adjusted for inflation and tax increases ) have remained basically the same has been a political talking point here in germany for as long as i can remember . 
  on average , standard of living is * high * in germany but we are n't rich , it 's the country and businesses who are rich . 
   the whole world wants to be as powerful as america this is actually an intresting tangent to look at a bit closer . 
  because this is what i see as the main point of misunderstanding between europeans and americans . 
  thing is , this is just what * americans * believe . 
  in the us there is a strong `` king of the hill '' view on geopolitics/economics . 
  they/you believe it 's a zero-sum game and that for others to gain something you have to lose that .
