  sehp , sep and sepp thus have decreasing emphasis on the e with each iteration . 
  basically like seeep , seep , sep. . joosseep would n't make a ton of sense seeing as the double-o and the ss cancel each other out , although i 'm sure there are some freak words in our language that are totally written that way . 
   are you saying gema should n't be able to demand money from youtube for music videos that are uploaded on the musicians official channel ? 
  probably meant that gema was asking for too much money per view , not complaining they asked at all . 
  proxtube had an extra proxtube search button right next to the normal one showing all results . 
  the `` shady shit '' was disableble ( ? ), 
  via a single click in the settings andtheir way to earn money . 
  if you turned it off , they did n't pester you about it anymore . 
  seemed perfectly fine to me . 
   berlin lives more up to the stereotype of rude , cold , mean spirited locals . 
  it 's not so much rude , cold or meanspirited , it 's berliner schnauze . 
  it 's waiving politeness for straightforwardness . 
  we 're not trying to be rude or anything . 
  ... unless you block the u-bahn , in which case you can fuck right off, 
  same goes for escalators , stairs and small sidewalks . 
  if you want/need to stop , fine by me , but make room and step to the side . 
  the world ai n't revolving around you , asshole . 
   and those words are no written in any sort of dictionary , because you just make them up on the fly . 
  hence there is no ` longest ' german word no , there actually * is * a longest german word . 
  it does n't need a place in the duden , but it needs to be used somewhere . 
  this usually is the case for `` legalese '' german , i.e. 
  words you 'd find written in the law ( as the examples above illustrate quite well ) . 
  we even once lost our longest word because the law was repealed and the word thus was n't actually in official use anymore . 
  that 's the polite for berliners . 
  nah , it totally is used , just not as commonly as on / de . 
  if you 're talking to someone rather young ( < 25 , probably more like < 22 or so tbqh ) who 's interested in hiphop , chances are actually quite high that person is either using brudi themselves or has friends that use brudi and wo n't give you too much of a weird look . 
  if you go out drinking with young people and you suddenly start adressing people as brudi , be ready to accept many free drinks , as it 's not exactly a term you 'd expect an american to use . 
  do n't let old people tell you what young people talk like . 
  brother -  bro , bruh , bruv bruder -  bru , brudi jugendsprache halt . 
  nah , they 're not . 
  part of that list are official lawsuits . 
  look them up yourself if you 're inclined , they 're public record . 
  i cited jesse jackson because the dude mentioned him first , btw . 
  here 's the very same jesse jackson criticizing trump numerous times : http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/11/16/jesse-jackson-trump-lit-match-he-has-put-out/93955780/ http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/jackson-black-voters-have-plenty-to-lose-with-trump/amp/ http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/jesse-jackson-trumps-cabinet-nominations-are-calculated-insult/amp/ you also ignored my entire list of acts that show trump 's racism . 
  it does n't matter how much more proof i 'll show you , you 've made up your mind and you 'll stay with that narrative , further wondering why anyone might think trump 's racist , waiting on your right-wing news sites to give you more reasons why trump is great . 
  so really what i 'm saying is i 'm tired of the discussion . 
  have a good evening nevertheless . 
  some black people are in favour of trump , welp , in that case he could n't possibly be racist , case closed, 
   because you dont have anything besides that ** 1973 ** : the us department of justice -- under the nixon administration , out of all administrations -- sued the trump management corporation for violating the fair housing act . 
  federal officials found evidence that trump had refused to rent to black tenants and lied to black applicants about whether apartments were available , among other accusations . 
  trump said the federal government was trying to get him to rent to welfare recipients . 
  in the aftermath , he signed an agreement in 1975 agreeing not to discriminate to renters of color without admitting to discriminating before . 
  ** 1980 ** s : kip brown , a former employee at trump 's castle , accused another of trump 's businesses of discrimination . 
  `` when donald and ivana came to the casino , the bosses would order all the black people off the floor , '' brown said . 
  `` it was the eighties , i was a teenager , but i remember it : they put us all in the back . '', 
  ** 1988 ** : in a commencement speech at lehigh university , trump spent much of his speech accusing countries like japan of `` stripping the united states of economic dignity . '', 
  this matches much of his current rhetoric on china . 
  ** 1989 ** : in a controversial case that 's been characterized as a modern-day lynching , four black teenagers and one latino teenager -- the `` central park five '' -- were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in new york city . 
  trump immediately took charge in the case , running an ad in local papers demanding , `` bring back the death penalty . 
  bring back our police ! '', 
  the teens ' convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison , and the city paid $ 41 million in a settlement to the teens . 
  but trump in october said he still believes they 're guilty , despite the dna evidence to the contrary . 
  ** 1991 ** : a book by john o\u2019donnell , former president of trump plaza hotel and casino in atlantic city , quoted trump 's criticism of a black accountant : `` black guys counting my money !, 
  i hate it . 
  the only kind of people i want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day . 
  ... i think that the guy is lazy . 
  and it 's probably not his fault , because laziness is a trait in blacks . 
  it really is , i believe that . 
  it 's not anything they can control . '', 
  trump at first denied the remarks , but later said in a 1997 playboy interview that `` the stuff o\u2019donnell wrote about me is probably true . '', 
  ** 1992 ** : the trump plaza hotel and casino had to pay a $ 200,000 fine because it transferred black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler 's prejudices . 
  ** 2000 ** : in opposition to a casino proposed by the st. regis mohawk tribe , which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in atlantic city , trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a `` record of criminal activity [ that ] is well documented . '', 
  ** 2004 ** : in season two of the apprentice , trump fired kevin allen , a black contestant , for being overeducated . 
  `` you 're an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education , and you have n't done anything , '' trump said on the show . 
  `` at some point you have to say , ` that 's enough . ' '' ** 2005 ** : trump publicly pitched what was essentially the apprentice : white people vs. black people . 
  he said he `` was n't particularly happy '' with the most recent season of his show , so he was considering `` an idea that is fairly controversial -- creating a team of successful african americans versus a team of successful whites . 
  whether people like that idea or not , it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world . '', 
  ** 2010 ** : just a few years ago , there was a huge national controversy over the `` ground zero mosque '' -- a proposal to build a muslim community center in lower manhattan , near the site of the 9/11 attacks . 
  trump opposed the project , calling it `` insensitive , '' and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project . 
  on the late show with david letterman , trump argued , referring to muslims , `` well , somebody 's blowing us up . 
  somebody 's blowing up buildings , and somebody 's doing lots of bad stuff . '', 
  ** 2011 ** : trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that obama -- the country 's first black president -- was not born in the us . 
  he even sent investigators to hawaii to look into obama 's birth certificate . 
  obama later released his birth certificate , calling trump a `` carnival barker . '', 
  ** 2011 ** : while trump suggested that obama was n't born in the us , he also argued that maybe obama was n't a good enough student to have gotten into columbia or harvard law school , and demanded obama release his university transcripts . 
  trump claimed , `` i heard he was a terrible student . 
  terrible . 
  how does a bad student go to columbia and then to harvard ? '', 
  but i 'm sure this is all fake this this , alternative facts that , lies here , not so bad there yadda yadda yadda, 
  yeah , i 'm completely aware and not ignorant . 
  milo is n't entitled to speak at berkeley , so the protests did n't hurt his right of free speech . 
  the right of free speech you 're holding on so dearly mans the government ca n't fuck you up for spaking your mind , however it does n't mean other people are n't allowed to protest the abhorrent bullshit you 're spewing . 
   whats racist that he is doing ? 
  please dont say the extreme vetting of islamic countries what 's racist that he is doing ? 
  please do n't say the racist shit he 's done . 
  k then, 
   suppression of free speech free speech is a right granted by the government , it does n't entitle you to spout stupid bullshit and be hear by everyone . 
  as such , the protests ca n't suppress free speech . 
   trump is a racist remember ? 
  why do ya think that is ? 
  probably because he 's saying and doing racist things . 
   it was proven that his birth certificate was really a fake https://rcradioblog.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/ahnee-birth-certificate-generates-layers-when-scanned-on-a-xerox-workcentre-just-like-the-presidents-lfbc-does/, 
  one quick check of his user history shows he 's perfectly capable of the german language . 
  does n't sound anything like the weird trollbots that sometimes stumble into r/de . 
   obama couldnt be criticized because he was black funny , because the dude starting/majorly supporting the birther movement doubting obamas birth certificiate ( calling it a fake after it was supplied ) is now your president . 
  you 'd think that would n't be possible if it was that bad to critize obama , right ? 
  you people have such an incredibly persecution complex , it 's staggering . 
  owning every important institution in the us and still crying because the evil bad lefties are oppressing you ? 
  judging one man for his own actions is a teeny-tiny bit different than lumping a few million people of a certain culture into the `` terrorist '' - sack , do n't you think ? 
  the judgement about trump may be overblown or not , but regardless of that , it 's judging trump for his own actions , period .
