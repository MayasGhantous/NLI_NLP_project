i second that . 
  it is one thing to have 100 ' 000s of man with aks and armored vehicles around and another to be able to sustain a military campaign . 
  it is not about what their top hardware can do on the paper , it is if they can use it efficiently . 
  even the small time conflicts in ukraine , caucasus and syria is strechting the russians army ability . 
  logistics , c3 and simple communication is lacking . 
  the army has been learning a lot since the poor performance in gerogia 2008 , but do n't expect it to be able to sustain a larger compaign against a more organized enemy . 
  you are giving the americans ideas about sanction which do work ;-), 
  no a direct , invasion and conquered or nuked to a desert type of thread . 
  but russia plays a dangerous game on their border , destabilizing countries . 
  germany will have to : * put effort and resources in helping rebuild/defend * weakened allies * spend attention and resources to russian ( social ) media campaigns inside germany and allies * being forced in putting priorities to the wrong area ( ie . 
  being asked to build up military power , instead of putting the money into long-lasting investments , like education ) * deal with panicking people about election rigging and other influence games . 
  and dead cat burial site, 
  everything from 7.62 mm to 20mm , hand grenades , anti-tank missiles and rpg ( non-live though ) . 
  as a conscript in the army . 
  right , most of the foreigners working there are living also abroad . 
  monaco & liechtenstein certainly suffer the same problem . 
  try https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/axw3g0b_700b_v1.jpg to save everyone 's eyes ;-), 
  it 's an orange madness, 
  breaking a lance ( for someone ) = supporting/fighting/arguing for someone, 
  some school ( humanistisches gymnasium ) have latin as a mandatory first foreign language in 5th grade and english as 2nd in 7th grade ( and ancient greek in 8th ) . 
  though there are not many : https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_altsprachlicher_gymnasien, 
  besides the already mentioned destinations , in germany , it 's also `` popular '' ( well , not millions do it , but everyone has heard of ) to do a camper tour through some areas , like national parks . 
  frankfurt has a bad rep due to it being the financial centre of germany and hosting most of its banks hqs , though it has more to offer and a long culture ... 
  why would languages disappear ? 
  thinking about it - when will switzerland finally get rid of the italian and romansch-speaking people ? 
  and decide on french or german ? 
  and what about belgium ? 
  when do they vote on removing `` the other language '' ? 
  maybe ask the basques , but i am still confused why you think anyone wants to slice you up into several parts . 
  why would anyone want to split people if they want to be together ? 
  that 's what national states do . 
  why would europe come up with the idea of splitting poland ? 
  i think you miss the idea . 
  it 's about regions that have their own identity . 
  no , why should it ? 
  people create identities . 
  it 's about protecting them . 
  a united europe would do more for regional identity than national states . 
  because a use would accept diversity , national states often have a `` default '' culture . 
  think spain and it 's regions or france or ( farewell :-( ) uk ... 
  yes . 
  usually clubs open in friday evening and play not loud music until midnight , then it 's saturday ... 
  on good friday it is even forbidden in many places to play loud music ( ! ), 
  my dutch is good enough ( i live in . nl ;-) ) . 
  what i meant to say - i have my doubt , that those rules for bikes are enforced at all . 
  why not start with traffic lights , bike lights , cycle on bike paths where available , right of way and other similar things which are fully ignored ( at least in amsterdam , ymmv ) . 
  you can still kick the shop owner into his balls, 
  laws regarding bike usage ? 
  it 's like with the weed - illegal , but will be tolerated ;-), 
   coffeeshops legally sell a product which they not only did obtain illegally but can only have obtained illegally . 
  and need a license for it !, 
  a license to sell illegal stuff legally , which appears magically in the shop and turns legal . 
  nope , hochdeutsch is usually associated with the region around hanover . 
  there are no real dialects in north germany as german is a foreign language introduced some while ago , before we spoke plattdeutsch ( or niederdeutsch ) . 
  my grandparents still spoke mainly platt . 
  well , during the move they tried to only move some governmental staff to berlin , so the economy of bonn would not break down immediately as it was the biggest employer in the city . 
  think about all the embassies and international facilities ... 
  so the government is still divided between berlin and bonn , for example among others the department of defence is still located in bonn . 
  this is the list of [ governmental branches still in bonn ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_der_bundesbeh%c3%b6rden_in_bonn ), 
  entrepreneurship and accepting failure ( both connected ) in europe people are too afraid to lose if they start their own businesses , take risks and leave their stable jobs . 
  and indeed a failed own business/startup is in many places still seen as something negative , also there is not much help/venture capital available . 
  it has changed slightly for it startups , but outside of it , it looks bleak . 
  why the change of orange to red ? 
  monarchy to democracy ? 
  the swiss . 
  it 's a big plus, 
  netherlands + italy : football france : economy ? 
  oh , and we do n't like the austrians and swiss , because they speak the same language , so should be like us , but somehow they are considered more cool than us . 
  ok , let 's do some nitpicking ... the spd was the successor of the sapd , which in turn is a merger of the adav and the sdap . 
  at the end the pre-war culture of the spd was not really a part of the sed . 
  according to the [ linke own history ] ( http://archiv2007.sozialisten.de/partei/geschichte/view_html?zid=28370&amp;bs=1&amp;n=4 ) a minority came from kpd and spd ( `` eine minderheit waren ehemalige mitglieder von kpd und spd '' ) . 
  we can surely say , that the culture of the sed is more present in the linke than spd was in the sed . 
  40 years forced communism ( with a spice of stalinism ) did it 's work . 
  i 'd say : * die partei - the only one doing serious politics, 
  die linke is merger between the pds ( successor of the former east german socialist unity party - sed ) and wasg ( a split off the spd in 2003 ) , where the former is the major part . 
  inspired by / u/abrasiveteapot * cdu/csu - undecided if it wants to appeal the masses and let everyone immigrate or cover up bavarian right extremists . 
  * spd - champagne socialism * fdp - just in there for the money from the lobbyists * die linke - former east germans communist party and other putin friends * die gruenen - treehuggers , who occasional like wars , but find technical progress suspicious * afd - the neo-nazis need a new party every few years when the cover is blown ( see npd ) * npd - the previous neo-nazi party * die piraten - geeks , who like flamewars, 
   this is the first i 've heard about any opposition to reunification by nato countries . 
  i have to wonder , what was their reason for opposing reunification , if you know ? 
  was it purely for economic reasons , or did they fear political tensions as well ? 
  it 's an interesting piece of how diplomacy works . 
  according to recently released documents , it was sorely mrs thatcher , who was opposed to the reunification , even in the british government , she was alone : [ spiegel online ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-iron-lady-s-views-on-german-reunification-the-germans-are-back-a-648364.html ) . 
  i think her main fear was , that the already biggest nation in europe would become even more powerful and self-sufficient . 
  it was always germany 's `` raison d'\u00e9tat '' ( what 's the english word for it ? ), 
  to be part of a european/international ( eu/nato/etc ... ) structure and not send soldiers abroad . 
  many people abroad forget this easily , when they ask germany for more leadership within the eu/eur zone/nato . 
  we are very reluctant to lead and force our opinion on others . 
  being part of an international structure is also what the 4 +2 ( funny in english they are called 2 +4 ) talks , with the 4 allied countries the usa , gb , france & ussr + both germanies , which made the reunification possible made clear . 
  ( germany did not have full sovereignty until the [ final treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_the_final_settlement_with_respect_to_germany ) ) . 
  that 's why the reunited germany was part of the nato and eu and committed itself to the eur . 
  thatcher , mitterand were the generation remembering the war and never fully trusted germany . 
  and indeed , imho a neutral germany would be now stuck between two power blocks ( nato and russia ) and would have sought a defence alliance ( possibly nuclear weapons ) on its own . 
  oh one thing to add came to my mind , while i was watching a documentation about the sr71 . 
  with the german reunification , the nato country germany also inherited a squadron of mig-29 ( including pilots ) , at that time the latest , greatest and most secret soviet aeroplane . 
  needless to say , they were very popular at manoeuvres with other nato countries , as everyone wanted to find out how they would perform against the former enemy . 
  they were retrofitted to nato standards and served in germany for more than 10 years . 
  haha , we had this `` guide '' who was making sure we did not get lost and did not make the wrong photos . 
  but i never felt unsafe there . 
  we were treated very nice and the state was unlikely to arrest us , not wanting to risk political tensions . 
  that changed drastically during the '90s and ' 00s when i went there again , with the state having lost control of the country and gangsters took over .
